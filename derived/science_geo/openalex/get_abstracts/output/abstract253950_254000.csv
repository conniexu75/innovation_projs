Here we demonstrate that HFE and TFR2 interact in cells, that this interaction is not abrogated by disease-associated mutations of HFE and TFR2, and that TFR2 competes with TFR1 for binding to HFE. We propose a new model for the mechanism of iron status sensing that results in the regulation of iron homeostasis. HFE and transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) are membrane proteins integral to mammalian iron homeostasis and associated with human hereditary hemochromatosis. Here we demonstrate that HFE and TFR2 interact in cells, that this interaction is not abrogated by disease-associated mutations of HFE and TFR2, and that TFR2 competes with TFR1 for binding to HFE. We propose a new model for the mechanism of iron status sensing that results in the regulation of iron homeostasis. All mammalian cells have an absolute requirement for iron. Both cellular iron deficiency and iron-overload are pathological and iron concentration in cells and body fluids is tightly regulated. Chronic malaccumulation of iron in tissues results in systemic iron-overload diseases that are collectively called hemochromatosis. Hereditary hemochromatosis in humans is linked to mutations in several genes namely HFE, transferrin receptor 2(TFR2), hemojuvelin (HJV), and hepcidin (HAMP) (reviewed in Ref. 1Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Hepcidin, a hepatocyte-derived soluble factor, negatively regulates intestinal absorption of dietary iron and the release of recycled iron into circulation from macrophages (2Nemeth E. Tuttle M.S. Powelson J. Vaughn M.B. Donovan A. Ward D.M. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Science. 2006; 306: 2090-2093Crossref Scopus (3637) Google Scholar). Also, hepcidin expression responds to body iron status (3Nicolas G. Chauvet C. Viatte L. Danan J.L. Bigard X. Devaux I. Beaumont C. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Hepcidin, therefore, plays a pivotal role as a regulator of whole-body iron homeostasis. Since disruption of HFE, TFR2, or HJV causes decreased hepcidin production these gene products appear to be involved in the upstream regulation of hepcidin (reviewed in Ref. 4Le Gac G. Férec C. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 13: 1172-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HFE, an atypical major histocompatibility complex class I molecule, associates with transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), 3The abbreviations used are: TFR, transferrin receptor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; Fe2-TF, diferric-transferrin. a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is the primary effector of cellular iron uptake (5Bennett M.J. Lebrón J.A. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TFR2 is a homolog of TFR1 and, like TFR1, can bind and internalize diferric-transferrin (Fe2-TF) (6Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). However, while TFR1 is widely expressed, TFR2 is expressed predominantly in hepatocytes, hematopoietic cells, and duodenal crypt cells, overlapping with HFE expression (6Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A.F. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 7Griffiths W.J.H. Cox T.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This and other differences in transcriptional regulation, Fe2-TF binding affinities and gene deletion phenotypes suggest that TFR1 and TFR2 have distinct roles in iron homeostasis. While TFR1 is a key mediator of iron uptake, TFR2 is postulated to play a regulatory role in whole-body iron homeostasis. Since hepcidin is produced predominantly by hepatocytes, it is likely that these cells express molecular determinants of iron sensing. Serum transferrin deficiency in hpx mice is associated with low hepcidin levels despite parenchymal iron loading, a phenotype corrected by transferrin administration (8Weinstein D.A. Roy C.N. Fleming M.D. Loda M.F. Wolfsdorf J.I. Andrews N.C. Blood. 2002; 100: 3776-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Also, elevated serum Fe2-TF stabilizes TFR2 protein in liver (9Robb A. Wessling-Resnick M. Blood. 2004; 104: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), an effect recapitulated in vitro (9Robb A. Wessling-Resnick M. Blood. 2004; 104: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Johnson M.B. Enns C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4287-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Circulating Fe2-TF is therefore likely to be an iron signal sensed by hepatocyte membrane proteins that regulate hepcidin production and TFR2 may be part of the regulatory system sensing transferrin saturation. Previous investigators hypothesized that HFE and TFR2 might belong together in such a regulatory pathway. An earlier study, however, demonstrated that soluble, purified ectodomains of HFE and TFR2 do not interact in vitro (11West A.P. Bennett M.J. Sellers V.M. Andrews N.C. Enns C.A. Bjorkman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38135-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), precluding the possibility that their roles in a convergent iron homeostasis pathway involve formation of an HFE-TFR2 complex. Here we investigate whether HFE and TFR2 interact when expressed in cells. Based on our findings, we propose that HFE plays an important role in iron sensing by conveying the whole-body iron status, reflected by transferrin saturation, from the HFE-TFR1 complex to TFR2, resulting in potential downstream signaling events. Cell Culture and Transfection—All cell culture media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) unless otherwise noted. AML12, a differentiated, non-transformed mouse hepatocyte cell line (12Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) was maintained in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's nutrient F-12 mixture (F-12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ATCC), 5 μg/ml human insulin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml human transferrin (Roche Applied Science), 5 ng/ml sodium selenite (Sigma), 40 ng/ml dexamethasone (Sigma), and 5 mm sodium pyruvate. CHO-TRVb-0 (TFR1-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells) and TRVb-1 (human TFR1 stably transfected TRVb-0) cells (13McGraw T.E. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) were cultured in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 5% FBS and 0.2% glucose. Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. Total amounts of DNA transfected in each experiment were kept equal in all samples by adding appropriate vector DNA. AML12, TRVb-0, and TRVb-1 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in antibiotic-free growth medium using methods described by the manufacturer. HEK293T cells were transfected with DNA:calcium phosphate co-precipitates using a HEPES-buffered calcium phosphate method (14Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A. & Struhl, K. (eds) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 9.1.1–9.1.11 and 12.1.1–12.1.6, Wiley-Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Transfection medium was replaced with fresh culture medium 12 h post-transfection and cells were harvested and lysed 48 h post-transfection. Expression Plasmids and Mutagenesis—1 μg of mouse liver RNA was used in reverse transcription reactions using Superscript II (Invitrogen) following protocols described by the manufacturer. Specific oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify mouse HFE, TFR1, and TFR2 cDNAs. Myc epitope-tagged TFR1 and TFR2 cDNAs were constructed by replacing the respective stop codons with an XhoI site and cloning into pcDNA3.1 myc-His plasmid (Invitrogen). HFE cDNA was first cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). This parent HFE cDNA was mutagenized using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to insert sequence coding for a FLAG epitope downstream of the HFE signal peptide. Mutagenesis of the mouse cDNAs to produce HFE and TFR2 mutants (HFEH67D, TFR2M167K, TFR2Y245X, and TFR2K685P) corresponding to human hemochromatosis associated HFE and TFR2 mutations (HFEH63D, TFR2M172K, TFR2Y250X, and TFR2Q690P, respectively) were also performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol. The TFR2Y245X mutant was generated by deletion of the sequences coding for amino acids 246–798 from the parent TFR2-myc construct. The resulting construct thus encoded amino acids 1–245 of mouse TFR2 followed directly by an inframe myc epitope tag. The conserved RGD motif in mouse TFR2 (spanning amino acids 673–675) was mutated to GGD. All plasmids were subjected to sequence analysis to confirm integrity. The T91-Display construct (encoding FSTL3-myc in pDisplay, Invitrogen) was a kind gift from Dr. Y. Sidis (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School) and is described in Ref. 15Sidis Y. Mukherjee A. Keutmann H. Delbaere A. Sadatsuki M. Schneyer A. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 3586-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar. Antibodies—Primary antibodies, anti-TFR1 monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-TFR2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Alpha Diagnostics), anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and agarose-conjuguated M2 antibody (Sigma), and anti-myc monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) were purchased. Protein G-conjugated agarose beads and protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads were purchased from Roche Applied Science and Sigma, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Mouse TrueBlot and rabbit TrueBlot secondary antibodies, which do not recognize denatured IgG, were purchased from eBiosciences. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells were washed once in ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. Cell pellets were lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). After mixing on ice for 15 min, cell lysates were centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min in a cooled table-top microcentrifuge to sediment nuclei and debris, and supernatants were collected and used in subsequent experiments. Crude membrane preparations were isolated from cell pellets using a hypotonic lysis method as described before (14Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A. & Struhl, K. (eds) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 9.1.1–9.1.11 and 12.1.1–12.1.6, Wiley-Interscience, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Prior to experiments crude membrane preparations were resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation, Gel Electrophoresis, and Western Blot Analysis—Total protein amounts in lysates were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay and equivalent amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were performed by first incubating cell lysates with the indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then precipitated by incubating reactions for an additional 2 h at 4°C with either Sepharose-conjugated protein A or agarose-conjugated protein G as appropriate. For FLAG immunoprecipitations, agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody was used and additional protein G incubations omitted. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blotting. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to pure nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Biosciences). The filters were stained with Ponceau S to confirm transfer and blocked with either 3% nonfat dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight at 4 °C. Filters were washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies. The filters were again washed four times, and immune complexes formed on the blot were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive protein bands were analyzed using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the United States National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). First, we transfected HEK293T cells with N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged HFE (FLAG-HFE) cDNA together with C-terminal myc epitope-tagged TFR2 (TFR2-myc) cDNA. In both cases epitope tags were in the extracellular domains. Lysates from transfected cells were used in immunoprecipitation analyses with anti-FLAG or anti-myc antibodies (Fig. 1A, B, and E). TFR2-myc was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody when co-expressed with FLAG-HFE. Singly transfected TFR2-myc was not immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody. In reciprocal anti-myc immunoprecipitations FLAG-HFE was co-immunoprecipitated when co-transfected with TFR2-myc. Hence, we demonstrate that HFE and TFR2 interact when expressed in cells. In similar experiments, when coexpressed with FLAG-HFE, TFR1-myc co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-HFE while an unrelated cell surface expressed C-terminal myc-tagged protein, T91-Display, did not (Fig. 1, A and E). Hence, HFE interacts specifically with TFR1 and TFR2. To extend our findings in a relevant cell-type, we assessed HFE-TFR2 interaction in crude membrane fractions of transfected AML12 mouse hepatocytes and confirmed TFR2-myc interaction with FLAG-HFE in these cells (Fig. 1C). To eliminate the possibility that HFE-TFR2 interaction involves TFR1 (by TFR1-TFR2 heterodimerization) we examined HFE-TFR2 interaction in CHO-TRVb-0 cells, which lack TFR1 expression. Again, TFR2-myc was immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody in lysates from cells expressing both TFR2-myc and FLAG-HFE (Fig. 1D). To test whether addition or chelation of non-transferrin-bound iron influences the interaction we repeated the co-immunoprecipitation analyses after treating transfected HEK293T cells with or without iron ammonium citrate or desferrioxamine. We found that neither treatment affected binding of FLAG-HFE to TFR1-myc or TFR2-myc (Fig. 1E). These findings contrast the lack of interaction previously reported between purified soluble ectodomains of HFE and TFR2 (11West A.P. Bennett M.J. Sellers V.M. Andrews N.C. Enns C.A. Bjorkman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38135-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It is possible that truncated HFE and TFR2 have altered binding characteristics compared with the native proteins. Also, expression in cell membranes might promote structural conformations or provide other molecular components that are required for, or stabilize, HFE-TFR2 interaction, while the ectodomain structures alone are sufficient for HFE-TFR1 interaction. Additionally, although residues in TFR1 essential for HFE-TFR1 interaction are not conserved in TFR2 (11West A.P. Bennett M.J. Sellers V.M. Andrews N.C. Enns C.A. Bjorkman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38135-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), it appears that they are not necessary for HFE-TFR2 interaction. Indeed, while mutation of a conserved RGD motif in TFR1 abrogates its interaction with both HFE and transferrin (16West A.P. Giannetti A.M. Herr A.B. Bennett M.J. Nangiana J.S. Pierce J.R. Weiner L.P. Snow P.M. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we demonstrate (Fig. 1A) that this mutation in TFR2 does not affect binding of TFR2 to HFE. To address whether hemochromatosis-associated mutations (HFEH63D, TFR2M172K, TFR2Y250X, and TFR2Q690P) affect HFE-TFR2 interaction we introduced the corresponding mutations (HFEH67D, TFR2M167K, TFR2Y245X, and TFR2K685P) into the mouse proteins. We show that wild type FLAG-HFE interacts with all three TFR2 mutants tested (Fig. 1A). Most notably the TFR2Y245X mutant that lacks 553 amino acids of the extracellular domain retains ability to interact with HFE suggesting that known disease-associated mutations downstream of Y250X (17Roetto A. Daraio F. Alberti F. Porporato P. Cali A. De Gobbi M. Camaschella C. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2002; 29: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) also do not influence HFE-TFR2 binding. Similarly, the HFEH67D mutation does not abrogate HFE-TFR2 binding (Fig. 1B). Since iron homeostasis is compromised by these mutations in humans, our observations imply that in disease states, HFE and TFR2 interact but subsequent signal transduction leading to hepcidin production is impaired. This in turn suggests that signal transduction initiated by the HFE-TFR2 interaction may require other molecular components that together with HFE and TFR2 form an iron sensor and signal transduction effector. Fe2-TF competes with HFE for binding to TFR1 (16West A.P. Giannetti A.M. Herr A.B. Bennett M.J. Nangiana J.S. Pierce J.R. Weiner L.P. Snow P.M. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) displacing HFE from the HFE-TFR1 complex. Also, increased serum transferrin saturation (9Robb A. Wessling-Resnick M. Blood. 2004; 104: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and treatment of cells with Fe2-TF (9Robb A. Wessling-Resnick M. Blood. 2004; 104: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Johnson M.B. Enns C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4287-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) enhances TFR2 protein stability. It is possible that when serum Fe2-TF is elevated, increased cellular TFR2 competes with TFR1 for binding to HFE in hepatocytes. To test whether HFE-TFR1 interaction is competed by TFR2, CHO-TRVb-1 cells, stably overexpressing TFR1 but not expressing TFR2, were transfected with either FLAG-HFE alone or with added increasing amounts of TFR2-myc cDNA. Lysates were assayed for the co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-HFE and TFR2-myc or endogenous TFR1. Increasing TFR2 expression reduced the amount of TFR1 co-immunoprecipitated with HFE, as determined after normalization to total cellular TFR1 (Fig. 2, A and B). The expression of T91-Display did not alter HFE-TFR1 co-immunoprecipitation. Additionally, as expected, treatment with Fe2-TF, reflecting competition of HFE-TFR1 interaction by transferrin, reduced co-immunoprecipitation of TFR1 with HFE. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that TFR2 competes with TFR1 for binding to HFE irrespective of Fe2-TF levels. Maximum competition of HFE-TFR1 interaction was seen, however, in the presence of both Fe2-TF and highest TFR2 expression. Elevated serum Fe2-TF increases TFR2 expression (9Robb A. Wessling-Resnick M. Blood. 2004; 104: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Johnson M.B. Enns C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4287-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) with concomitant reduction of TFR1 (18Hubert N. Lescoat G. Sciot R. Moirand R. Jego P. Leroyer P. Brissot P. J. Hepatol. 1993; 18: 301-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in hepatocytes. These changes would favorably bias the formation of an HFE-TFR2 complex over an HFE-TFR1 complex. Thus emerges an iron status sensing role for HFE and the HFE-TFR2 interaction. HFE, TFR2, and HJV proteins appear to be upstream regulators of hepcidin production (reviewed in Ref. 4Le Gac G. Férec C. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 13: 1172-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and Fe2-TF is likely the iron status signal (8Weinstein D.A. Roy C.N. Fleming M.D. Loda M.F. Wolfsdorf J.I. Andrews N.C. Blood. 2002; 100: 3776-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 19Wilkins S.J. Frazer D.M. Millard K.N. McLaren G.D. Anderson G.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since serum Fe2-TF (20Levy J.E. Montross L.K. Cohen D.E. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 9-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and TFR2 expression (9Robb A. Wessling-Resnick M. Blood. 2004; 104: 4294-4299Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Johnson M.B. Enns C.A. Blood. 2004; 104: 4287-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) are increased and Hjv and Hamp are intact in Hfe–/– mice that show dysregulated iron homeostasis (20Levy J.E. Montross L.K. Cohen D.E. Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 9-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it appears that HFE is integral to the signal transduction mechanism that senses increased Fe2-TF and produces a cellular response in terms of regulated hepcidin expression. We therefore propose a new model for iron homeostasis (Fig. 3). Under basal transferrin saturation, HFE remains complexed with TFR1. When serum Fe2-TF increases, HFE is competed by Fe2-TF from TFR1, and thus dissociated, HFE constitutes a molecular sensor for serum transferrin saturation. HFE conveys the elevated Fe2-TF status by interaction with TFR2, leading to the formation of an initial iron sensor and signal transduction effector complex. Downstream signaling would then lead to the production of hepcidin that contributes to the regulation of whole-body iron homeostasis. In HFE- or TFR2-dependent human hemochromatosis and related mouse models, this sensor and signal transduction effector complex would not be functional, and hepcidin production would not be induced by high Fe2-TF, thereby causing dysregulation of whole-body iron homeostasis and iron loading in parenchymal cells. In conclusion, HFE and TFR2 interact in cells including hepatocytes, and this interaction may form the basis of a systemic iron sensor in hepatocytes. We thank Dr. Y. Sidis for providing the T91-Display-myc cDNA and are indebted to Drs. A. Mukherjee and B. Ballif for invaluable discussion and advice."

https://openalex.org/W1972129669,"RNase R is a processive, 3′ to 5′ hydrolytic exoribonuclease that together with polynucleotide phosphorylase plays an important role in the degradation of structured RNAs. However, RNase R differs from other exoribonucleases in that it can by itself degrade RNAs with extensive secondary structure provided that a single-stranded 3′ overhang is present. Using a variety of specifically designed substrates, we show here that a 3′ overhang of at least 7 nucleotides is required for tight binding and activity, whereas optimum binding and activity are achieved when the overhang is 10 or more nucleotides in length. In contrast, duplex RNAs with no overhang or with a 4-nucleotide overhang bind extremely poorly to RNase R and are inactive as substrates. A duplex RNA with a 10-nucleotide 5′ overhang also is not a substrate. Interestingly, this molecule is bound only weakly, indicating that RNase R does not simply recognize single-stranded RNA, but the RNA must thread into the enzyme with 3′ to 5′ polarity. We also show that ribose moieties are required for recognition of the substrate as a whole since RNase R is unable to bind or degrade single-stranded DNA. However, RNA molecules with deoxyribose or dideoxyribose residues at their 3′ termini can be bound and degraded. Based on these data and a homology model of RNase R, derived from the structure of the closely related enzyme, RNase II, we present a model for how RNase R interacts with its substrates and degrades RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1993645457,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and failure are problems of increasing importance. Regardless of the primary etiology, CKD is characterized by tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis. It has been assumed that diminished matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity is responsible for the accumulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and collagens that typify the fibrotic kidney. Here we demonstrate that transgenic renal proximal tubular epithelial expression of a specific enzyme, MMP-2, is sufficient to generate the entire spectrum of pathological and functional changes characteristic of human CKD. At the earliest point, MMP-2 leads to structural alterations in the tubular basement membrane, a process that triggers tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition, with resultant tubular atrophy, fibrosis and renal failure. Inhibition of MMP-2, specifically in the early, prefibrotic stages of disease may offer an additional approach for treatment of these disabling disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2058785803,"Prominent features of cancer cells include metabolic imbalances and enhanced resistance to mitochondrial apoptosis. The fact that tumors rely heavily on glycolysis to meet their metabolic demands has been recognized since the beginning of the twentieth century, yet a complete elucidation of the so-called Warburg effect has not been achieved. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including the upregulation of rate-limiting steps of glycolysis, the accumulation of mutations in the mitochondrial genome, the hypoxia-induced switch from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis or the metabolic reprogramming resulting from the loss-of-function of enzymes like fumarate and succinate dehydrogenases. How aerobic glycolysis and apoptosis resistance are linked remains to be elucidated. On the one hand, these alterations may be acquired independently by cancer cells during multistep oncogenesis. On the other hand, the suppression of the intrinsic apoptotic program may be achieved through mechanisms that directly lead to the Warburg phenotype. Cancer-specific mitochondrial alterations and bioenergetics may be taken advantage for the development of two novel classes of antineoplastic agents. A first approach would target glycolysis and/or revert the Warburg phenomenon, whereas a second approach would aim at inducing apoptosis by targeting mitochondrial proteins and membranes. In both instances, encouraging pre-clinical results have been obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2006732453,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) can arise during DNA replication, or after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, and their correct repair is fundamental for cell survival and genomic stability. Here, we show that the Smc5–Smc6 complex is recruited to DSBs de novo to support their repair by homologous recombination between sister chromatids. In addition, we demonstrate that Smc5–Smc6 is necessary to suppress gross chromosomal rearrangements. Our findings show that the Smc5–Smc6 complex is essential for genome stability as it promotes repair of DSBs by error-free sister-chromatid recombination (SCR), thereby suppressing inappropriate non-sister recombination events."
https://openalex.org/W1997360499,"In this report, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a serum-borne bioactive lipid, is shown to activate tight-junction-associated protein Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1), which in turn plays a critical role in regulating endothelial chemotaxis and barrier integrity. After S1P stimulation, ZO-1 was redistributed to the lamellipodia and cell-cell junctions via the S1P1/Gi/Akt/Rac pathway. Similarly, both endothelial barrier integrity and cell motility were significantly enhanced in S1P-treated cells through the Gi/Akt/Rac pathway. Importantly, S1P-enhanced barrier integrity and cell migration were abrogated in ZO-1 knockdown cells, indicating ZO-1 is functionally indispensable for these processes. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we demonstrated that cortactin plays a critical role in S1P-induced ZO-1 redistribution to the lamellipodia. In addition, S1P significantly induced the formation of endothelial tight junctions. ZO-1 and α-catenin polypeptides were colocalized in S1P-induced junctional structures; whereas, cortactin was not observed in these regions. Together, these results suggest that S1P induces the formation of two distinct ZO-1 complexes to regulate two different endothelial functions: ZO-1/cortactin complexes to regulate chemotactic response and ZO-1/α-catenin complexes to regulate endothelial barrier integrity. The concerted operation of these two ZO-1 complexes may coordinate two important S1P-mediated functions, i.e. migration and barrier integrity, in vascular endothelial cells. In this report, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a serum-borne bioactive lipid, is shown to activate tight-junction-associated protein Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1), which in turn plays a critical role in regulating endothelial chemotaxis and barrier integrity. After S1P stimulation, ZO-1 was redistributed to the lamellipodia and cell-cell junctions via the S1P1/Gi/Akt/Rac pathway. Similarly, both endothelial barrier integrity and cell motility were significantly enhanced in S1P-treated cells through the Gi/Akt/Rac pathway. Importantly, S1P-enhanced barrier integrity and cell migration were abrogated in ZO-1 knockdown cells, indicating ZO-1 is functionally indispensable for these processes.

The concerted operation of these two ZO-1 complexes may coordinate two important S1P-mediated functions, i.e. migration and barrier integrity, in vascular endothelial cells. Endothelial barrier integrity is an important physiological function of the endothelium in vivo. Dysregulated barrier integrity is implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, such as stroke, inflammation, various immune responses, etc. (1Fenstermacher J.D. Nagaraja T. Davies K.R. Blood Brain Barrier: Drug Delivery and Brain Pathology. Kluwer Academic-Plenum Publishers, New York2000Google Scholar). To elucidate the function and regulation of endothelial barrier integrity, cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells have been widely employed as an in vitro model system to study the blood-brain barrier (BBB) 2The abbreviations used are: BBB, blood-brain barrier; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; S1P1 (old nomenclature EDG-1, endothelial differentiating gene-1), the high affinity GPCR for S1P; ZO-1, Zonula Occludens-1; ECIS, electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing technique; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; si-S1P1, silencing RNA for S1P1 receptor; si-ZO-1, silencing RNA for ZO-1 polypeptide; PTO, phosphothioate oligonucleotide; PECAM, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule; VE-cad, VE-cadherin; PTx, pertussis toxin; moi, multiplicity of infection; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; TEER, transendothelial electrical resistance. 2The abbreviations used are: BBB, blood-brain barrier; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; S1P1 (old nomenclature EDG-1, endothelial differentiating gene-1), the high affinity GPCR for S1P; ZO-1, Zonula Occludens-1; ECIS, electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing technique; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; si-S1P1, silencing RNA for S1P1 receptor; si-ZO-1, silencing RNA for ZO-1 polypeptide; PTO, phosphothioate oligonucleotide; PECAM, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule; VE-cad, VE-cadherin; PTx, pertussis toxin; moi, multiplicity of infection; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; TEER, transendothelial electrical resistance.

Evidence from these studies indicates that BBB plays a critical role in regulating the homeo-static environment of the brain and the transportation of plasma constituents into brain. Furthermore, it has been shown that severely impaired blood-brain barrier integrity is attributed to the pathological states of various neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (3Plumb J.

However, the molecular details for the formation and maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity are poorly understood. It was recently reported that the association of cortactin, an F-actin cross-linking polypeptide, and myosin light chain kinase is crucial in S1P-enhanced endothelial barrier integrity (11Dudek S.M.

Furthermore, it is well documented that tight junctions are important in regulating BBB formation (12Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol.

In addition, S1P greatly enhances VE-cadherin (VE-cad)-based adherens junctions in endothelial cells (14Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M Sha¡ afi R.I. Hla T.

Also, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM), E-selectin, and intercellular cell adhesion molecules (ICAM) are regulated in endothelial cells with S1P treatment (16Krump-Konvalinkova V. Yasuda S. Rubic T. Makarova N. Mages J. Erl W. Vosseler C. Kirkpatrick J. Tigyi G. Siess W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1-7Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Together, S1P-mediated endothelial barrier function may be the concerted activation of these molecules required for junctional structures and cell-cell interaction.Here we demonstrate that S1P treatment not only significantly increases endothelial barrier integrity, but also greatly enhances cell migration into electrically wounded areas, as determined by electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing technology (ECIS) (17Keese C.R. Wegener J. Walker S.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In addition, both endothelial barrier integrity and chemotactic response were found to be controlled by the same signaling cascade, i.e. S1P1/Akt/Rac pathway. Thus, it suggests that a common modulator may be present to regulate both responses. In this report, evidence is shown that Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1), a tight junction-associated protein, is functionally critical in regulating S1P-mediated endothelial barrier integrity and chemotactic response. Data from this study also suggest that S1P induces the formation of distinct ZO-1 functional complexes, which in turn control the distinct physiological processes of the endothelium.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials, Cell Culture, and Adenoviral Transduction—Sphingosine 1-phosphate was obtained from Biomol. Pertussis toxin (PTx) and Ly294002 were from Calbiochem. Other reagents, unless specified, were from Sigma. Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells stably expressing the S1P1 receptor were cultured essentially as described (18Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H.

Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs, gift of Dr. Kwang Sik Kim, Johns Hopkins University) were cultured essentially as HUVECs. For adenoviral transduction, cells were infected with adenoviral particles carrying various cDNA constructs for 12 h prior to stimulation with S1P as previously described (18Lee M.J. Thangada S.

The oligonucleotides sequences for the construct 1: (sense): 5′-gatcc GTGAG CAATA TTCAC GCAGT TATTC AAGAG ATAAC TGCGT GAATA TTGCT CACTT TTTTg-3′, (antisense): 5′-aattc AAAAA AGTGA GCAAT ATTCA CGCAG TTATC TCTTG AATAA CTGCG TGAAT ATTGC TCACg-3′; and construct 2: (sense) 5′-gatcc GTTAT TCGCC TGCAT ACAAT AATTC AAGAG ATTAT TGTAT GCAGG CGAAT AACTT TTTTg-3′, (antisense): 5′-aattc AAAAA AGTTA TTCGC CTGCA TACAA TAATC TCTTG AATTA TTGTA TGCAG GCGAA TAACg-3′. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the Lentiviral pFIV-H1 vector (System Bioscience). Lentiviral transducing particles were produced by packaging in the 293T/17 cell line following the manufacturer's instructions. Lentiviral particles carrying the siRNA oligonucleotide for luciferase were used as a control in this study. HUVECs (6 × 105 cells) were infected with Lentiviral particles (∼0.1 moi) in 60-mm dishes for 24 h in the presence of polybrene (2 μg/ml), washed and replaced with fresh medium for additional 24 h. Subsequently, cells were split (1:3 split ratio), and stably transduced HUVECs were isolated with Puromycin (1 μg/ml) selection. In addition, two pairs of oligonucleotides were used to knockdown S1P1 receptor, the construct 23: (sense) 5′-gatcc GCACT ATATC CTCTT CTGCT TCAAG AGAGC AGAAG AGGAT ATAGT GCTTT TTTg-3′, (antisense) 5′-aattc AAAAA AGCAC TATAT CCTCT TCTGC TCTCT TGAAG CAGAA GAGGA TATAG TGCg-3′; the construct 24: (sense) 5′-gatcc GTCTA CTCCT TGGTC AGGAC TTCAA GAGAG TCCTG ACCAA GGAGTAGATT TTTTg-3′, (antisense) 5′-aattc AAAAA ATCTA CTCCT TGGTC AGGAC TCTCT TGAAG TCCTG ACCAA GGAGT AGACg-3′.Immunofluorescence Analysis—Recently confluent HUVECs (3 × 105 cells in 35-mm glass bottom dishes, MatTek) were serum-starved in plain M199 medium for 2 h, followed by stimulation with S1P (500 nm, 30 min). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100, and immunostained with the indicated primary antibodies overnight. Following incubation with Alexa488- or Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), the stained images were visualized and photographed with the Axiovert 200 m epi-fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss).Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk, the membranes were blotted with 1 μg/ml of ZO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or cortactin antibody (4F11, Upstate). Subsequently, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with their corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) and visualized using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences).Phosphothioate Oligonucleotide Transfection—The following 15-mer phosphothioate oligonucleotide (PTO) was synthesized to block the expression of cortactin polypeptide: antisense cortactin, 5′-AGCGT GGCCT GCTGA-3′. The sense PTO, 5′-TCAGC AGGCC ACGCT-3′, was used as a control. For PTO transfection, HBMECs (2 × 106 in a 100-mm dish) were co-transfected with PTO (100 nm) and cDNA vector of green fluorescent protein (GFP, 8 μg) (15Lee M.J. VanBrocklyn J.R. Thangada S. Liu C.H. Hand A.R. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) for overnight by Lipofectamine reagent. Subsequently, cells were serum-starved in medium M199 supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 24 h. After stimulating without or with S1P (500 nm) for 30 min, cells were subjected to immunoblot or immunostaining as described above.Transmission Electron Microscopy—HUVECs (1 × 105 cells) were plated in tissue culture flasks (12.5 cm2, Falcon). Three days later, cells were starved in plain M199 for 2 h, followed by stimulating without or with S1P (500 nm, 30 min). Cells were fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide-0.8% potassium ferricyanide in cacodylate buffer, treated with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate and embedded in epoxy resin. Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed in a Philips CM10 electron microscope at 60 kV.Electrical Cell Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) Assay—ECIS™ Model 1600R (Applied BioPhysics) was used to measure the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) in confluent or electrically wounded endothelial cells to study the S1P-regulated barrier integrity and migratory response, respectively (17Keese C.R. Wegener J. Walker S.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Briefly, to study the endothelial integrity function, 200 μl of cell suspension (5 × 105 cells per ml) were seeded to each well of either a 8W1E or 8W10 ECIS array (one electrode or 10 electrodes per well, respectively), which was pre-equilibrated with 200 μl of medium at 37 °C for 30 min. 2-3-days later, endothelial cells were serum-starved in plain M199 medium for 2 h at 37 °C. After stimulation with S1P, the endothelial integrity function was measured in real-time as described (17Keese C.R. Wegener J. Walker S.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). For migratory response, the cell-covered electrode was connected to an AC source. By applying 5 volts for 30 s, a relatively high current was delivered to the cell-covered electrode and killed the cells on the electrode (250 μm diameter) (17Keese C.R. Wegener J. Walker S.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Thereafter, endothelial migratory responses were determined in real-time by measuring the recovery of electrical impedance, an indicator of the surrounding viable endothelial cells migrating into the wounded area, in the presence or absence of S1P treatment.Migration Assay—Endothelial chemotaxis was measured by using the transwell migration assay (8 μm pore size, Costar) as described (18Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Gopal S.P. Ancellin N. Chan S.S. Wu M. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Alessi D. Hla T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Briefly, polycarbonate membranes were coated with human fibronectin (1 μg/ml) for overnight at 4 °C. Following serum starvation, HUVECs were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in M199 media with 0.5% fatty-acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Cells (7.5 × 104 cells in 100 μl) were placed in the upper chamber and media (600 μl) containing various concentrations of S1P were added to the lower chamber. Endothelial cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. Subsequently, the nonmigrated cells on the upper side of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. The filters were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution. Following eluting the stained dye with 10% acetic acid, cell chemotaxis was quantitated with BMG FluoStar Galaxy microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies) at A590 nm.Statistic Analysis—Student's t test was used for statistic analysis. p-value < 0.001 was considered as statistically significant.RESULTSTo study the dynamic behavior of endothelial cells in culture, the ECIS was used to measure the S1P-regulated TEER in real time (17Keese C.R. Wegener J. Walker S.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In this technology, as endothelial cells attach and spread on the small gold film electrode of the ECIS array, cellular membranes restrict the electrical current, forcing it to flow beneath and between the cells, resulting in a dramatic increase in electrical impedance (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, the endothelial cells attached to the circular microelectrode (250-μm diameter) can be selectively killed by applying a high voltage electrical current (5 volts for 30 s, arrowhead in Fig. 1a). The efficiency of this electrical current to completely kill endothelial cells attached to the microelectrode was shown by an abrupt drop of electrical impedance (Fig. 1a) and was verified by microscopic observation (panels I and II, Fig. 1b). Subsequently, the viable cells surrounding the wounded microelectrode were allowed to migrate into the electrically wounded area, and reestablished the cell-cell interaction over the electrode (panels III and IV, Fig. 1b). The kinetics for this sequence of events can be monitored in real-time by the increase of electrical impedance (Fig. 1a).We utilized the ECIS technique to monitor the spatial and temporal behavior of S1P-regulated migration in repairing the endothelial injury. Endothelial cells attached to the circular microelectrodes were killed by elevating electrical current and the surrounding viable cells were allowed to migrate into the wounded area in the presence or absence of S1P. As shown in Fig. 2a, S1P treatment significantly increased the TEER in the electrically injured endothelial monolayers. Microscopic examination showed that the raised TEER correlated well with the numbers of cells migrated into the wounded area (Fig. 2b). Moreover, this S1P effect on cell motility was markedly diminished in S1P1 knockdown ECs (si-S1P1) (Fig. 2c), indicating S1P1 receptor play a critical role in this process. The reduced but detectable S1P-responsiveness in si-S1P1 cells may be caused by the residual S1P1 receptor in knockdown cells (Fig. 2e). It was shown that S1P is able to activate Akt and Rac GTPase in endothelial cells (18Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Gopal S.P. Ancellin N. Chan S.S. Wu M. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Alessi D. Hla T.

As shown in Fig. 2d, the S1P-induced cell migration in ECIS wound-healing assay required Akt and Rac activities, because transduction with adenoviral particles carrying dominant-negative -Akt and -Rac polypeptides completely inhibited endothelial migration to repair the wounds; whereas, transduction with control β-galactosidase particles had no effect (Fig. 2, c and d).FIGURE 2S1P accelerates endothelial migration in ECIS wounding assay. a, endothelial cells on the micro-electrodes of the ECIS wells were killed with a high electrical voltage as described. Subsequently, the migration of viable cells into the wounded microelectrodes was measured in real-time by electrical impedance in the presence or absence of S1P (500 nm). b, micrographs of ECIS arrays, taken at 3 h after electrical injury. -S1P and +S1P, without or with S1P addition, respectively.

After killing the cells on the microelectrodes, the migratory responses were measured with or without S1P treatment. e, 50 μg of extracts from endothelial cells transduced with si-Luc and two different si-S1P1 constructs (23 and 24) were directly immunoblotted with anti-S1P1 (upper panel). Lower panel, 500 μg of extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-S1P1 followed by immunoblotting with anti-S1P1. Densitometric quantitation showed that ∼80 and 60% of S1P1 were knocked-down in si-S1P1 23 and 24 transduced endothelial cells. Middle panel, Western blot with anti-actin showed the protein equal loading and the absence of off-target effect by si-S1P1 silencing. f, in a parallel experiment, endothelial cells were transduced with 200 moi of adenoviral particles as described in panel d. 500 μg of cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-S1P1, followed by immunoblotting with anti-S1P1 (top panel). Alternatively, 50 μg of extracts were immunoblotted with anti-Akt or anti-Myc to show the expression of transduced polypeptides (middle and lower panels) (18Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Gopal S.P.

As shown in Fig. 3a, S1P significantly enhanced endothelial migration in the transwell migration assay, and S1P-induced chemotaxis was markedly reduced in S1P1 knockdown endothelial cells. Moreover, transduction with dominant-negative Akt and Rac completely abrogated S1P-induced chemotactic response (Fig. 3b). In a control, transduction with β-galactosidase had no effect on S1P-enhanced endothelial chemotaxis. In addition, a small scrape wound was made across a confluent monolayer of HUVEC and cell migration into the denuded area was measured (Fig. 3c). S1P treatment significantly accelerated cell migration into the wounded area; whereas, wound closure in the absence of S1P was retarded (Fig. 3c, upper panels). Furthermore, the denuded area remained unpopulated in dominant-negative Akt and Rac transduced cells after S1P stimulation (Fig. 3c, lower panels). In a control, the denuded area was repopulated by β-galactosidase transduced endothelial cells in the presence of S1P treatment (Fig. 3c, middle panel). These results together suggest that the S1P-activated S1P1/Akt/Rac pathway is capable of enhancing cell motility to repair the injured endothelial monolayer.FIGURE 3S1P-mediated signaling regulates endothelial migration. a, chemotactic responses were measured by transwell migration assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note that S1P-induced chemotactic responses were significantly inhibited in both construct 23 and 24 si-S1P1 endothelial cells. b, Transwell migration assays were performed with ECs transduced with Adenoviral particles carrying β-galactosidase, dominant-negative -Akt and -Rac vectors in the presence or absence of S1P stimulation. The data in a and b are the mean ± S.E. of three determinants from a representative experiment, which was repeated two times with similar results. c, phase contrast micrographs show the S1P-enhanced repair of endothelial injuries. Wounds were introduced in confluent monolayers of wild-type (upper panels), β-galactosidase (middle panels), dominant-negative Akt or Rac (lower panels) transduced cells with sterile microtips. After stimulation without or with S1P for 16 h, cells were fixed. The distances (numbers in upper right, μm) between two edges of wounds were quantitated with a Zeiss microscope equipped with Axiovert image software (Carl Zeiss). The data are the mean ± S.E. of 6 microscopic fields from two determinants, which were repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next utilized the ECIS assay to examine the effects of S1P on cell-cell interaction in confluent endothelial monolayers. As shown in Fig. 4a, a robust increase of TEER was observed immediately after S1P treatment, indicating that S1P was able to enhance endothelial cell-cell interaction. The S1P-induced cell-cell interaction was sustained for more than 6-10 h after S1P treatment and thus was not a transient event. S1P-enhanced TEER was markedly abrogated in S1P1 knockdown endothelial cells (si-S1P1), and not in control cells stably expressing si-RNA for luciferase (si-Luc) (Fig. 4b). This indicates that S1P-enhanced TEER is primarily controlled by the endothelial S1P1 receptor. This conclusion was supported by the observation that S1P-enhanced endothelial barrier integrity was abrogated in the presence of pertussis toxin (PTx, Fig. 4c), as S1P1 signaling is dependent on the Gi heterotrimeric G protein. Previously it was shown that S1P1 signaling activates the PI 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/Rac pathway to regulate endothelial chemotaxis and morphogenesis (18Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Gopal S.P.

Therefore, we examined whether PI3K/Akt/Rac signaling controls S1P-mediated TEER. As shown in Fig. 4d, treatment with Ly294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, or adenoviral particles carrying dominant-negative Akt or Rac constructs, significantly inhibited the S1P-enhanced TEER. Together, these results indicate that S1P-enhanced intercellular interaction is controlled by the S1P1-mediated Gi/PI3K/Akt/Rac signaling pathway.FIGURE 4S1P signaling enhances transendothelial electrical resistance and induces tight junction formation. a, the TEER, an indicator of endothelial integrity function (10Garcia J.G.N.

Diverse protocadherin isoforms encoded by the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ gene clusters are expressed in all of the vertebrates studied. For the Pcdh-α isoforms, differential expression patterns have been found in single Purkinje cells by unusual monoallelic and combinatorial types of gene regulation. Here we investigated total allelic gene regulation in the Pcdh-α and -γ clusters, including the C-type variable exons (C1 to C5) and the Pcdh-γA and -γB variable exons in single Purkinje cells.

Thus, the multiple gene regulations in the Pcdh-α and -γ clusters had a potential mechanism for increasing the diversity of individual neurons in the brain. The brain contains a huge number of neurons that have diverse characteristics and identities to enable the generation of complex neuronal networks. Therefore, the molecular mechanism for specifying the identity and diversity of single neurons is important for realizing the complexity of the brain. Approximately 100 diverse cadherin superfamily genes are highly expressed in the brain (1Yagi T. Takeichi M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1169-1180PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hamada S. Yagi T. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 41: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Among them, the CNRs (cadherin-related neuronal receptors) are also diverse and highly expressed in the vertebrate brain (3Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S. Kai N. Yasuda R. Watanabe M. Ishii H. Yasuda M. Mishina M. Yagi T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1137-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The CNRs are Pcdh-α (protocadherin-α) genes. Their diverse isoforms are generated from gene clusters on chromosomes; these clusters of Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ contain variable regions (tandemly arrayed diverse variable exons) and constant regions (common, cis-spliced exons of Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ) (4Wu Q.

This diversity of Pcdh cluster genes could be one of the mechanisms by which neurons are distinguished from each other. The single-cell analysis of Purkinje cells using multiple RT-PCRs showed that the expression of each variable exon in the Pcdh-α gene is monoallelic and combinatorial (13Esumi S. Kakazu N. Taguchi Y. Hirayama T. Sasaki A. Hirabayashi T. Koide T. Kitsukawa T. Hamada S. Yagi T. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This was a novel type of allelic expression for diversified receptor families in the brain. The differential expression patterns of the Pcdh-α isoforms in single neurons also suggested a mechanism for providing the identity and specificity of single neurons in the brain (13Esumi S.

The variable exons of the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ clusters are classified into several subgroups, Pcdh-α, Pcdh-γA, Pcdh-γB, and C-type (4Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 10Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.F. Kim Y. Grimwood J. Schmutz J. Dickson M. Noonan J.P. Zhang M.Q. Myers R.M. Maniatis T. Genome. Res. 2001; 11: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The Pcdh-α gene cluster contains the variable exons Pcdh-α1to Pcdh-α12, and in addition, α7/8 exists in wild mouse strains and two C-type variable exons, C1 and C2 (10Wu Q. Zhang T. Cheng J.F. Kim Y.

The five C-type variable exons of Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ are highly homologous to each other and distinct from the other exons in the clusters. Here we examined the allelic gene regulation of these types of variable exons in the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ gene clusters at the single-cell level. Interestingly, the C-type variable exons were constantly expressed in Purkinje cells at postnatal day (P) 3The abbreviations used are: Pn, postnatal day n; B6, C57BL/6; RT, reverse transcription. 21 from both alleles, although monoallelic and combinatorial types of expression were commonly found for the Pcdh-α, Pcdh-γA, and Pcdh-γB variable exons. Our results indicated that biallelic and monoallelic gene regulation for variable exons coexist for each Pcdh gene cluster. The monoallelic and combinatorial expression of distinct Pcdh-α, Pcdh-γA, and Pcdh-γB variable exons is a potential mechanism for generating distinct identity in single Purkinje cells. Animals—F1 hybrid offspring were obtained by intercrossing mice of the laboratory strain C57BL/6 (B6) (Purchased from Charles River) with the Japanese wild mouse strain JF1, obtained from the National Institute for Genetics (Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan). The mouse strain JF1 is different from that of our previous report (13Esumi S. Kakazu N. Taguchi Y. Hirayama T. Sasaki A. Hirabayashi T. Koide T. Kitsukawa T. Hamada S. Yagi T. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) but shares similar polymorphisms in Pcdh-α locus. The JF1 mice show more suitable characteristics for daily care than MSM mice. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (13Esumi S. Kakazu N. Taguchi Y. Hirayama T. Sasaki A. Hirabayashi T. Koide T. Kitsukawa T. Hamada S. Yagi T. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 16Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A.

The Pcdh-α CP3 probe bound to the identical 3′-untranslated regions of Pcdh-α1 to 12, C1, C2, and 7/8 (JF1). Split Single-cell RT-PCR of Purkinje Cells—Split single-cell RT-PCR of Purkinje cells was carried out as described previously (13Esumi S. Kakazu N. Taguchi Y. Hirayama T. Sasaki A. Hirabayashi T. Koide T. Kitsukawa T. Hamada S. Yagi T. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In brief, single Purkinje cells were prepared from the cerebellum of the F1 mice from B6 female × JF1 male, at P21. The tissue was dissected and subjected to enzymatic digestion at 37 °C for 30 min in 10 ml of dissociation solution consisting of 90 units of papain (Worthington), 0.002% dl-cysteine HCl (Sigma), 0.05% DNase I (Sigma), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 0.05% glucose (Nacalai Tesque). The digested tissue was spun for 8 min at 300 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma). To remove debris, the cells were filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer (Falcon). Single Purkinje cells were picked up by glass capillary and placed in thin, 200-μl PCR tubes with 6 μl of RNase-free water in each tube. Complementary DNA was synthesized from single-cell samples after being primed with 40 pmol/reaction of each primer in a total volume of 10 μl, using 7.5 units of Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, at 55 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by heating at 85 °C for 5 min. The cDNAs derived from a single Purkinje cell were split into three PCR tubes as 3.3-μl aliquots and used as a template for the multiplex first PCR. The first multiplex PCR was performed using 3.3 μl of single-cell cDNA, 5 μl of 10× LA PCR buffer, 3.9 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 4 μl of 2.5mm each dNTP mix, 0.3 μl of 10 mm each primer set, 0.5 μl of LA Taq polymerase (TAKARA), and 31.5 μl of water, and the PCR conditions of 1 cycle of 5 min at 96 °C and then 30 cycles of 20 s at 96 °C and 10 min at 65 °C. The primer sequences are shown in supplementary Table S1. The 5′ PCR primer was based on a consensus sequence contained in all of the variable exons and located in their EC5 regions. The primers for RT-PCR were located in different exons to rule out, by size differences, the detection of amplified genomic DNA. The second round of each PCR was then performed using 0.l μl of the first PCR product as a template (final volume, 20 μl). In this second PCR, each cDNA was amplified individually using its specific primer pair by performing seminested PCR: 1 cycle of 5 min, 95 °C; 35 cycles of 30 s, 95 °C; 30 s, 60 °C; 1 min, 72 °C. The PCR-amplified products were purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation, subjected to direct sequencing using a BigDye™ DNA sequencing kit (version 3.1) (ABI), and analyzed on an ABI Prism 3100 or an ABI Prism 3730 Genetic Analyzer. The direct sequencing permitted us to identify the allele from which each purified PCR product was derived. The discrimination of monoallelic expression from biallelic expression was accomplished by using SeqScape software (ABI). In Situ Hybridization Analysis of the C-type Variable Exons in the Pcdh-α Cluster—We previously examined the expression levels of the Pcdh-α variable exons in Purkinje cells (13Esumi S. Kakazu N. Taguchi Y. Hirayama T. Sasaki A. Hirabayashi T. Koide T. Kitsukawa T. Hamada S. Yagi T. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The Pcdh-α cluster contains two of the C-type of variable exons, C1 and C2 (14Taguchi Y. Koide T. Shiroishi T. Yagi T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Takei Y. Hamada S. Senzaki K. Mutoh T. Sugino H. Yagi T. Genomics. 2001; 72: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the expression levels of the C1 and C2 mRNAs in individual Purkinje cells of the B6 mouse cerebellum using in situ hybridization (Fig. 1). Although the RNA probes specific for the C1 and C2 variable exons stained all of the Purkinje cells uniformly, the signal intensities, which may reflect expression level, were different: faint for the C1 probe (Fig. 1B) and strong for the C2 probe (Fig. 1C), similar to that of the constant region (CP) antisense probe (Fig. 1D). The expression pattern of Pcdh-α3 was different from that of the C1 and C2 variable exons (Fig. 1E); the signal for Pcdh-α3 was not detected uniformly but rather was detected in subpopulations of Purkinje cells. These results suggested that every Purkinje cell expressed C1 and C2 transcripts, in contrast to the expression of the Pcdh-α variable exons. Distinct Expression Patterns of Pcdh-α C1 and C2 from Those of Pcdh-α1to α12 in Single Purkinje Cells—We next examined the expression profiles of the C1 and C2 variable exons in the Pcdh-α cluster. We first sequenced the C1 and C2 variable exons of the JF1 mouse strain and detected polymorphisms against the B6 strain (supplemental Fig. S1). Using the cerebellar Purkinje cells of P21 F1 mice from a B6 × JF1 cross, we performed split single-cell RT-PCR analyses (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Single Purkinje cells were picked up by glass capillary. Complementary DNA of Pcdh-α, Pcp-2, and β-actin was synthesized from the single-cell samples in a same tube, and the resulting cDNA was then divided into three tubes and subjected to separate, first round multiplex PCR analysis. The second round of PCR amplification was carried out individually for each tube and used nested primers for each Pcdh-α variable exon, the Pcdh-α consensus region, Pcp-2 (a marker for Purkinje cells) (17Oberdick J. Baader S.L. Schilling K. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 383-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and β-actin (Fig. 2). Of the 14 single Purkinje cells analyzed, all had a Pcdh-α variable exon consensus PCR product in at least one of the three tubes. Neither sample 1-8 nor sample 1-16, which were subjected to the entire procedure without Purkinje cells, gave any PCR products, confirming the reliability of the method. When the cells were subjected to exon-specific second round PCR (Fig. 2), all 14 were positive for β-actin and Pcp-2, confirming that they were differentiated Purkinje cells. All 14 Purkinje cells had three of three specific PCR amplifications for at least one of the 13 Pcdh-α variable exons (α1 to α12), consistent with our previous results (13Esumi S. Kakazu N. Taguchi Y. Hirayama T. Sasaki A. Hirabayashi T. Koide T. Kitsukawa T. Hamada S. Yagi T. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition to three of three PCR amplifications, some of the cell showed one of three or two of three PCR amplifications (for example, α1 in cell 1-2); it may suggest the low amount of the corresponding mRNAs in that cells. All 14 cells were positive for C1 and C2 (Fig. 2), supporting our in situ hybridization results (Fig. 1, B and C). Although C2 showed specific PCR amplification in all the divided tubes, C1 was not always amplified in all three divided tubes (cells 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-6, 1-14, and 1-15). These results indicated that most of the Purkinje cells uniformly expressed the C1 and C2 variable exons, which is different from the other Pcdh-α variable exons. Next, each PCR product was subjected to direct sequencing to distinguish three possible patterns of expression: monoallelic expression of the maternal allele, monoallelic expression of the paternal allele, and biallelic expression. A monoallelic expression pattern was found for 14 of the 21 three of three PCR-positive products (66.7%) for the Pcdh-α1 to α12 variable exons (Table 1). The monoallelic expression pattern was found in the following 14 isoforms; α2 in cell 1-1; α4 in cell 1-4; α2, α5, and α10 in cell 1-5; α2 and α3 in cell 1-6; α2 and α4 in cell 1-9; α7 and α10 in cell 1-10; α7 in cell 1-11; and α4 and α12 in cell 1-14. In the cases of some isoforms (for example, α2 in cell 1-3), each PCR product showed different results, suggesting that the isoform was expressed biallelically and at a low abundance. If this assay could detect a single cDNA molecule even though biallelic products were present in one PCR tube, complete three of three monoallelic expression would be theoretically observed at 25% (18Rhoades K.L. Singh N. Simon I. Glidden B. Cedar H. Chess A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 789-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Clearly, at 66.7% versus 25%, there was a highly significant difference by χ square analysis between monoallelic and biallelic expression (p < 10–2). Of the 14 monoallelically expressed isoforms, nine were derived from the B6 allele and five from the JF1 allele. Thus, no allelic distortion from the paternal or maternal allele was found in this assay. These findings supported previous results showing monoallelic and combinatorial expression of the Pcdh-α variable exons in Purkinje cells (13Esumi S. Kakazu N. Taguchi Y. Hirayama T. Sasaki A. Hirabayashi T. Koide T. Kitsukawa T. Hamada S. Yagi T. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). —In the same cells, we analyzed the allelic expression patterns of the C1 and C2 variable exons. Biallelic expression patterns were found for 14 of the 14 three of three PCR-positive products (100%) for the C2 variable exon. For the C1 variable exon, biallelic expression patterns were found for eight of the nine three of three PCR-positive products (89%). One cell (11%) (cell 1-9) showed a monoallelic expression pattern, but the value was almost similar to the theoretical threshold, 25%, indicating biallelic expression of the C1 variable exon. These results demonstrated that, in contrast to the Pcdh-α1 to α12 variable exons, the C-type variable exons in the Pcdh-α cluster were expressed biallelically in Purkinje cells.TABLE 1Distribution of the B6 and JF1 allele as the source of each Pcdh-α variable exon revealed in the split single-cell RT-PCR analysis in Purkinje cells Open table in a new tab Uniform and Biallelic Expression of the C-type Variable Exons in the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ Clusters—To extend the results obtained for the C1 and C2 variable exons, the expression patterns of all five C-type variable exons in the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ clusters were analyzed in single Purkinje cells by split single-cell RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3). The C-type variable exons in the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ clusters were expressed relatively uniformly; 19 of 21 cells analyzed showed the C1 variable exon, and all 21 cells showed the C2 to C5 variable exons. Next, the allelic expression patterns were analyzed by sequencing the PCR products (Table 2). Biallelic expression patterns were commonly found for all five of the C-type variable exons in the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ clusters; biallelic expression was observed in 13 of the 13 three of three PCR-positive products (100%) for the αC1 variable exon, 18 of 18 (100%) for the αC2 variable exon, 21 of 21 (100%) for the γC3 variable exon, 19 of 19 (100%) for the γC4 variable exon, and 15 of 16 (94%) for the γC5 variable exon. These results demonstrated that the C-type variable exons in the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ clusters were relatively uniformly expressed and biallelically gene-regulated in Purkinje cells.TABLE 2Distribution of the B6 and JF1 allele as the source of each Pcdh-α C1,-αC2, and Pcdh-γ C3,-γ C4, and -γ C5 exons revealed in the split single-cell RT-PCR analysis in Purkinje cells Open table in a new tab Monoallelic and Combinatorial Expression of the Pcdh-α, Pcdh-γA, and Pcdh-γB Variable Exons in Purkinje Cells—The allelic expression patterns of the Pcdh-γA and -γB variable exons in the Pcdh-γ cluster were examined. Prior to this, we identified polymorphisms of the Pcdh-γ variable exons between the B6 and JF1 strains. First, certain Pcdh-γ exons (Pcdh-γA7 and -γA10 of the 12 γA variable exons and Pcdh-γB1and -γB7 of the 7 γB variable exons) were chosen, and their expression patterns were analyzed using split single-cell RT-PCR analysis in single Purkinje cells (Table 3 and Fig. 4). Among 32 Purkinje cells (Pcp-2 positive), 14 showed the PCR amplification of Pcdh-γA7, -γA10, -γB1, or -γB7 in all three divided tubes (Fig. 4). These cells were used for allelic expression analysis. The other 19 cells did not show PCR amplification in all three of the divided tubes: 8 cells showed no PCR amplification, and the other 11 cells showed PCR amplification in one or two tubes. Monoallelic expression patterns were found for all 18 of the three of three PCR-positive products (100%) for the Pcdh-γA and Pcdh-γB variable exons (Table 3). Of the 18 monoallelically expressed isoforms, 9 were derived from the B6 allele, and 9 were derived from the JF1 allele. No allelic distortion was found for the Pcdh-γA or Pcdh-γB variable exons. These results demonstrated that the Pcdh-γA and Pcdh-γB variable exons were each regulated monoallelically in single Purkinje cells. Monoallelic and combinatorial expression patterns of distinct variable exons were also found for the Pcdh-γA and Pcdh-γB variable exons. Taken together with our previous findings, these results indicated that each Purkinje cell coexpressed both Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ variable exons.TABLE 3Distribution of the B6 and JF1 allele as the source of each Pcdh-γA7,-γA10,-γB1, and -γB7 exon revealed in the split single-cell RT-PCR analysis in Purkinje cells Open table in a new tab Next, we directly examined the coexpression of the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ variable exons in single Purkinje cells. The split single-cell RT-PCR analysis clearly showed that each single Purkinje cell coexpressed both Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ variable exons (data not shown). We further analyzed four Purkinje cells; two of these cells expressed the Pcdh-γB1 variable exon from the B6 allele, and two expressed Pcdh-γB7 from the JF1 allele. These four Purkinje cells expressed different combinations of Pcdh-α. One Pcdh-γB1-positive cell showed two of three PCR-positive results for the α5 product from the B6 allele and three of three for the α6 product (the alleles could not be distinguished because there are no polymorphisms), another Pcdh-γB1-positive cell had two of three positive PCR results for α6 expression and three of three for α12 from the B6 allele. In addition, one Pcdh-γB7-positive cell shows two of three positive PCR results for α5 from the B6 allele, two of three for α9 from the JF1 allele, and two of three for α12 from the B6 allele. Another showed three of three positive PCR results for α4 from the B6 allele and three of three for α6 (Fig. 5 and Table 4). Thus, an individual Purkinje cell could express various combinations of the Pcdh-α, Pcdh-γA, and Pcdh-γB variable exons from different alleles, suggesting that more combinatorial diversity is provided by such differential expression.TABLE 4Coexpression of Pcdh-α and -γ variable exons in single Purkinje cells Open table in a new tab Here we showed that the mouse Pcdh gene clusters contain both monoallelically and biallelically expressed variable exons and that the Pcdh genes are expressed combinatorially and differentially within a single Purkinje cell. Specifically, the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γA and -γB variable exons were monoallelically regulated, whereas the C-type variable exons in the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ clusters were biallelically regulated. All of the C-type variable exons were relatively uniformly expressed in all Purkinje cells of the P21 mouse cerebellum. This finding is consistent with the in situ hybridization results reported previously (19Frank M. Ebert M. Shan W. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Colman D.R. Kemler R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 29: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γA and -γB variable exons were expressed monoallelically and combinatorially in single Purkinje cells of the P21 mouse cerebellum. The expression patterns of the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ gene clusters revealed in the present study are shown in Fig. 6. Various combinations of the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ isoforms were expressed in individual Purkinje cells at P21, whereas all of the C-type variable exons in the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ gene clusters were constitutively expressed. Our previous report and this study have shown that two species of Pcdh-α transcripts were combinatorially expressed from the Pcdh-α cluster, and all five of the C-type exons in Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ were expressed uniformly. The variety of Pcdh-γA and -γB species can be extrapolated from the present results. Among the 32 Purkinje cells analyzed, a clear band representing the PCR product in all three split tubes was found in eight cells for the Pcdh-γA7/A10 genes and in 10 cells for the Pcdh-γB1/B7 genes (Fig. 3). That is, 0.25 (8/32) Pcdh-γA7/A10 and 0.31 (10/32) Pcdh-γB1/B7 exons were expressed per Purkinje cell. There are 12 Pcdh-γA and 7 Pcdh-γB variable exons in the gene cluster. Therefore, assuming there is no distortion of choice for expression, we can estimate that 1.5 kinds of Pcdh-γA (0.25 multiplied by 12/2) and 1.09 kinds of Pcdh-γB (0.31 multiplied by 7/2) should be expressed per individual Purkinje cell. In total, ∼2 of 13 Pcdh-α, ∼1 of 12 Pcdh-γA, and ∼1of7 Pcdh-γB would be expressed in a Purkinje cell. In theory, the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ transcripts can produce 109,200 {(26 × 25)/2 × 24 × 14} possible combinations (2 from 26 Pcdh-α (13 from each allele), one from 24 Pcdh-γA (12 from each allele), and one from 14 Pcdh-γB (7 from each allele)) in a single Purkinje cell. Therefore, these variable exons may provide diversity sufficient to represent 105 different individual Purkinje cells. The present study showed that both the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ transcripts were expressed in the same Purkinje cell. It was previously reported that Pcdh-α protein and Pcdh-γ protein can form a heterodimer, which translocates to the cell surface. Although Pcdh-α is hardly expressed on the cell surface of HEK293 cells transfected with Pcdh-α alone (20Mutoh T. Hamada S. Senzaki K. Murata Y. Yagi T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is easily detected when HEK293 cells are transfected with both Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ (21Murata Y. Hamada S. Morishita H. Mutoh T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49508-49516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It suggests that this heterodimeric complex of Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ may be functional on the cell surface of the Purkinje cells. Although it remains to be shown whether the ligand specificity of this protein complex is different from that of the corresponding monomeric proteins, the formation of the heterodimer complex on the cell surface may provide molecular diversity to guide specific cell-to-cell interactions and recognition in the brain. It was previously shown that the expression patterns of the C-type Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ transcripts are different from those of the other variable exons during mouse brain development. The transcription levels of Pcdh-α C1 and C2 peak at P10, whereas those of the other Pcdh-α exons peak at P0 (15Takei Y. Hamada S. Senzaki K. Mutoh T. Sugino H. Yagi T. Genomics. 2001; 72: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, Frank et al. (19Frank M. Ebert M. Shan W. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Colman D.R. Kemler R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 29: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that the Pcdh-γ transcripts of γA, γB, and γC3 are expressed before birth and peak at P9. The γC4 transcript expression peaks at P9 but is down-regulated strongly thereafter; in contrast, the γC5 transcript is detected around the end of the first postnatal week and then increases (19Frank M. Ebert M. Shan W. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Colman D.R. Kemler R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 29: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Notably, the study by Frank et al. revealed that the Pcdh-γC3 variable exon was more prominently expressed than the others. This is consistent with our present results and supports our interpretation that the number of PCR products in the split single-cell RT-PCR analysis reflects the expression level. Given that the combinations of C-type Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ transcripts vary at different developmental stages, it can be postulated that the C-type variable exons confer temporal diversity, and the Pcdh-α1 to a12 and the Pcdh-γA and γB variable exons confer spatial diversity for neuronal cell identity in the developing mouse brain. Monoallelic expression has been observed for some genes. It is categorized into five types: (i) X inactivation (22Lyon M.F.

Hamada S. Yagi T. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The present study indicates that the Pcdh-γA and -γB variable exons also belong in the fifth group, whereas the C-type Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ exons are not regulated monoallelically and do not belong in any of these groups. Almost all of the random monoallelically expressed genes (groups iv and v) exist as a cluster, with the genes in the same cluster all showing monoallelic expression (31Kelly B.L. Locksley R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2982-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 34Sano Y. Shimada T. Nakashima H. Nicholson R.H. Eliason J.F. Kocarek T.A. Ko M.S. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1833-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A well known exception is the Rad50 gene in the interleukin gene cluster, in which the interleukin genes are expressed monoallelically, whereas the Rad50 gene is expressed biallelically (31Kelly B.L. Locksley R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2982-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Notably, although the Rad50 gene has a different promoter and different exons from the interleukin genes, the C-type Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ variable exons have a distinct but related promoter and share common exons with other protocadherin genes in the same cluster (35Tasic B.

Su H. Bradley A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1890-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to investigate the regulatory mechanism(s) of protocadherin expression, which may uncover a novel mechanism for the regulation of monoallelic gene expression. The present study showed that both the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ gene clusters contain monoallelically and biallelically expressed genes. Our results indicate that the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ gene clusters were generated by the duplication of a common ancestor gene and that the ancestral gene cluster already contained both monoallelically and biallelically expressed variable exons. Further studies aimed at revealing the mechanisms of expression of the protocadherin gene cluster will be particularly valuable for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in generating the diversity of individual neurons. The creation of neuronal cell diversity by the repertoire of Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ is expected to be revealed as a significant molecular mechanism by which functional neuronal circuits are acquired in the vertebrate brain.

https://openalex.org/W2001393635,"The JAK/STAT pathway has pleiotropic roles in animal development, and its aberrant activation is implicated in multiple human cancers. JAK/STAT signaling effects have been attributed largely to direct transcriptional regulation by STAT of specific target genes that promote tumor cell proliferation or survival. We show here in a Drosophila melanogaster hematopoietic tumor model, however, that JAK overactivation globally disrupts heterochromatic gene silencing, an epigenetic tumor suppressive mechanism. This disruption allows derepression of genes that are not direct targets of STAT, as evidenced by suppression of heterochromatin-mediated position effect variegation. Moreover, mutations in the genes encoding heterochromatin components heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and Su(var)3-9 enhance tumorigenesis induced by an oncogenic JAK kinase without affecting JAK/STAT signaling. Consistently, JAK loss of function enhances heterochromatic gene silencing, whereas overexpressing HP1 suppresses oncogenic JAK-induced tumors. These results demonstrate that the JAK/STAT pathway regulates cellular epigenetic status and that globally disrupting heterochromatin-mediated tumor suppression is essential for tumorigenesis induced by JAK overactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1984347108,"Nitric oxide (NO) has both prooxidant and antioxidant activities in the endothelium; however, the molecular mechanisms involved are still a matter of controversy. PGC-1alpha [peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma coactivator 1-alpha] induces the expression of several members of the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification system. Here, we show that NO regulates this system through the modulation of PGC-1alpha expression. Short-term (<12 h) treatment of endothelial cells with NO donors down-regulates PGC-1alpha expression, whereas long-term (>24 h) treatment up-regulates it. Treatment with the NOS inhibitor l-NAME has the opposite effect. Down-regulation of PGC-1alpha by NO is mediated by protein kinase G (PKG). It is blocked by the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor ODQ and the PKG inhibitor KT5823, and mimicked by the cGMP analog 8-Br-cGMP. Changes in PGC-1alpha expression are in all cases paralleled by corresponding variations in the mitochondrial ROS detoxification system. Cells that transiently overexpress PGC-1alpha from the cytomeglovirus (CMV) promoter respond poorly to NO donors. Analysis of tissues from eNOS(-/-) mice showed reduced levels of PGC-1alpha and the mitochondrial ROS detoxification system. These data suggest that NO can regulate the mitochondrial ROS detoxification system both positively and negatively through PGC-1alpha."

To identify new colonization and virulence factors that mediate STM pathogenesis, we have isolated STM cells from RAW 264.7 macrophages at various time points following infection and used a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach to detect the changes in STM protein abundance. Because host resistance to STM infection is strongly modulated by the expression of a functional host-resistant regulator, i.e. natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1, also called Slc11a1), we have also examined the effects of Nramp1 activity on the changes of STM protein abundances. A total of 315 STM proteins have been identified from isolated STM cells, which are largely housekeeping proteins whose abundances remain relatively constant during the time course of infection. However, 39 STM proteins are strongly induced after infection, suggesting their involvement in modulating colonization and infection. Of the 39 induced proteins, 6 proteins are specifically modulated by Nramp1 activity, including STM3117, as well as STM3118-3119 whose time-dependent abundance changes were confirmed using Western blot analysis. Deletion of the gene encoding STM3117 resulted in a dramatic reduction in the ability of STM to colonize wild-type RAW 264.7 macrophages, demonstrating a critical involvement of STM3117 in promoting the replication of STM inside macrophages.

Because its symptoms resemble human typhoid fever caused by the S. enterica serovar Typhi, STM-mediated systemic infection in BALB/c mice represents an established model system to investigate the pathogenesis and immunology of typhoid fever in humans (1Jones B.D. Falkow S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).In BALB/c mice, STM invades mainly microfold (M) cells in Peyer's patches after oral ingestion and is then taken up by the phagocytes adjacent to the infected M cells. From there, STM disseminates though the lymphatic system and replicates within the macrophages of spleen and liver (2Richter-Dahlfors A. Buchan A.M.J. Finlay B.B. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 3Salcedo S.P. Noursadeghi M. Cohen J. Holden D.W. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Macrophages play a dual role in STM-mediated systemic infection. In naive mice, macrophages are directly involved in controlling the morbidity and mortality of infected mice. Macrophages also function as immune effectors to help in the clearance of STM and recovery from infection in vaccinated mice (4Wijburg O.L. Simmons C.P. van Rooijen N. Strugnell R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 944-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, whether STM is able to successfully establish a systemic infection in mice depends on its ability to colonize and proliferate inside host macrophages. Indeed, STM strains unable to replicate inside macrophages fail to cause systemic infection and are avirulent (5Fields P.I. Swanson R.V. Haidaris C.G. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1986; 83: 5189-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar).After uptake by Nramp1-negative (N-) macrophages, STM resides in a unique cellular compartment called the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). Unlike normal phagosomes, most SCVs become segregated from late endosomes and lysosomes and lack lysosomal hydrolases. In addition, the fusion is blocked between most SCVs with newly formed vesicles containing functional phagocyte NADPH oxidase or inducible nitric-oxide synthase, which generate antibacterial reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, respectively. One of the STM virulence systems directly involved in regulating the biogenesis of SCV is the type III secretion system (T3S) encoded by Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-2 (SPI-2). Found in many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, T3S is a needle-like structure that physically connects the cytoplasms of bacterial and host cells, permitting direct translocation of bacterial effector proteins into the cytosol of host cells to alter the function of host cells in favor of disease progression (6Hensel M.

Nramp1 activity competes with the ability of STM to control the biogenesis of SCV, probably via up-regulation of some SPI-2-related genes, and increases the traffic of lysosomal hydrolases to the SCV to facilitate the killing of STM (10Cuellar-Mata P.

Almost all of these proteins have been identified using traditional molecular, genetic, and/or biochemical means, and their identification has helped greatly to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of STM to survive inside macrophages.Different mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods have been used to identify STM proteins. After separation by two-dimensional electrophoresis, ∼233 STM proteins were identified from STM cultured under varied growth conditions (15Encheva V. Wait R. Gharbia S.E. Begum S. Shah H.N.

Nature. 2006; 440: 304-307Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, no measurements have been reported in which time-dependent changes in the abundance of STM proteins are determined following the infection of macrophages.To identify key proteins linked to the successful colonization of macrophages, we used an accurate mass and time (AMT) tag proteomic approach developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to identify the STM proteins isolated from the RAW 264.7 macrophages with or without functional Nramp1 at different time points of infection. These results represent the first systematic investigation of changes in the abundance of bacterial proteins associated with macrophage colonization by using a global proteomics approach. Systematic investigation of the bacterial proteins important for colonization of macrophages will help to identify the potential candidates that can be used in the detection of bacterial pathogens and the development of effective vaccines.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Standard Procedures—All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen.

One day before infection, cells were harvested, counted with a Coulter Z™ Series cell counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates. After the cells adhered to the bottom of the wells, they were treated with 2 ml/well of recombinant interferon-γ (100 units/ml) for 21-24 h. Cultures of STM were prepared from frozen stocks in LB and grown for 18 h at 37 °C. They were harvested, washed once with the same volume of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered-saline (DPBS), and resuspended in 1 ml of DPBS. After their concentrations were determined, STM cells were diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and incubated on ice for 30 min. After macrophage cells were washed twice with 2 ml/well of Hanks' buffered saline solution (HBSS), 1 ml of the STM in DMEM was added in each well with a multiplicity of infection of 100. To increase the uptake of STM, plates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Uptake of STM was allowed to occur for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. This time point was defined as 0 h post-infection (p.i.). After cells were washed three times with 2 ml/well of HBSS to remove the STM that were not taken up by the cells, 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum and 12.5 μg/ml of gentamicin was added to each well.Isolation of STM Cells—At different predetermined time points, the cells were washed twice with 2 ml/well of HBSS and then used for isolating STM cells. Two different methods were used to isolate STM cells, and all procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Method 1 requires ∼4 h, does not involve the use of any detergents, and was originally developed as a gentle procedure to isolate organelles, including the phagosome/SCV. This procedure employed 1 ml/well of homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, and 0.5 mm EGTA) to lift the cells (22Hashim S. Mukherjee K. Raje M. Basu S.K. Mukhopadhyay A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16281-16288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The cells from two plates were pooled and lysed by passing cells 30 times through a ball bearing homogenizer with a clearance of 12 μm (Isobiotech, Heidelberg, Germany). Homogenates were then centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed at room temperature, diluted with 3 volumes of homogenization buffer, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min. The pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer, loaded on 10 volumes of 12% sucrose cushion, and centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 45 min. The STM cells were recovered from the bottom of the centrifuge tubes with 100 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.4.In contrast, method 2 involves the differential solubilization of the host membranes by taking advantage of the detergent resistance of the outer membrane of STM cells in comparison to the membranes from macrophages (23Eriksson S. Lucchini S. Thompson A. Rhen M. Hinton J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). After washing with HBSS, cells were lysed for 30 min with 1 ml/well of cell lysis solution (0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) acidic phenol, and 19% (v/v) ethanol in double distilled water). The cell lysates from two plates were pooled and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were washed twice with HBSS and resuspended in 100 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.4. The isolated STM cells were analyzed subsequently by electron microscopy, LC-MS or WB.Electron Microscopy—Portions (50 μl) of isolated STM cells were diluted with 1 ml of 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, washed twice with the same buffer, and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. Cells were then washed three times in cacodylate buffer and exposed to 1% OsO4 for 1 h. After three additional cacodylate washes, cells were gradually dehydrated using a series of ethanol solutions, including three washes in 100% ethanol, 10 min each. Samples were infiltrated with 50:50% ethanol and LR White resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and washed three times in 100% LR White, 15 min each. The cellular material was transferred to gelatin capsules filled with LR White and polymerized at 60 °C overnight. Hardened blocks were sectioned on an ultramicrotome (Ultracut UCT, Leica, Germany) to a thickness of 70 nm, and sections were mounted on 200 mesh copper grids with Formvar film sputtered with carbon (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Sections were post-stained with 1% uranyl acetate and lead citrate (Electron Microscopy Sciences) to provide contrast. They were imaged using a JEOL 2010 HR transmission electron microscope operating at 200 kV. Images were collected digitally on a CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) by using Digital Micrograph software.Lysis of STM Cells and Tryptic Digestion—STM cells were lysed by bead beating (maximum speed, 5 min, 20 °C) in a Mini-Bead-Beater-8™ (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) with 0.1-mm zirconia/silica beads in 2-ml sterile microcentrifuge tubes. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. After protein concentrations were determined, urea, thiourea, and dithiothreitol were added to the supernatants at final concentrations of 7 m, 2 m, and 5 mm, respectively, and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. The samples were then diluted 10-fold with 100 mm NH4HCO3 in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 and subjected to digestion by trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 1:50 w/w trypsin-to-protein ratio for 3 h at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were desalted with strong cation exchange columns (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and concentrated with a SpeedVac. The resulting peptide concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit, and the trypsindigested peptides were quickly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C until analysis with LC-MS (24Elias D.A. Monroe M.E. Marshall M.J. Romine M.F. Belieav A.S. Fredrickson J.K. Anderson G.A. Smith R.D. Lipton M.S. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 3120-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).LC-MS Analysis and Peptide Identification—All samples were analyzed by following protocols established previously (25Smith R.D. Anderson G.A. Lipton M.S. Pasa-Tolic L. Shen Y. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Udseth H.R. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 26Pasa-Tolic L. Masselon C. Barry R.C. Shen Y. Smith R.D. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 621-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were first analyzed with a ThermoElectron model LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron Corp., San Jose, CA) coupled to a high pressure and high efficiency capillary LC separation system based upon a reverse-phase C18 as stationary phase. Upon elution from the capillary column, peptides were ionized by electrospray ionization and directly entered the mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) from collisionally induced dissociation of peptides in the ion trap were used to identify the peptides using the SEQUEST™ program (27Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. II I J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5365) Google Scholar). Peptides were considered of acceptable confidence for population into the initial AMT tag data base if the scores provided by SEQUEST passed those filters used by Washburn et al. (28Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates J.R. II I Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4053) Google Scholar) with the additional criteria of a minimum discriminant score (29Strittmatter E.F. Kangas L.J. Petritis K. Mottaz H.M. Anderson G.A. Shen Y. Jacobs J.M. Camp II, D.G. Smith R.D. J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) of 0.5 (on a 0-1 scale, with 1 being the highest quality match). The data base that contained both the STM LT2 and mouse data bases was used for the searches for peptides, and both STM and mouse peptides were identified and populated into the same AMT tag data base.In parallel to the building of the initial AMT tag data base, all samples were analyzed with a 9.4-tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonic, Billirica, MA) after the peptides were separated by reverse-phase capillary high pressure liquid chromatography under identical conditions as described above. Each biological sample was analyzed in triplicate on the FTICR mass spectrometer. Relevant information such as the elution time from the capillary LC column, the abundance of the signal (integrated area under the elution profile), and the monoisotopic mass (determined from charge state and the high accuracy m/z measurement) of each feature observed in the FTICR was used to match the peptide identifications contained within the initial AMT tag data base. A matching feature was required to be within 5 ppm of the peptide mass and the normalized elution time (NET) within 5%. These peptides, now identified and quantified, were used to infer the protein composition of the samples. All proteins were required to have at least three observed peptides to be included in the confident results. In addition, the number of peptides observed for each protein in a biological sample was divided by the total number of peptides determined from the same sample to give an estimate of relative abundance of each identified protein in the sample. Heat maps were generated using the software tool OmniViz™3.8 (OmniViz, Maynard, MA). The “relative risk” (RR) of each LC-FTICR data set was calculated (RR = (RRL-RRT)/RRL) from the number of matching AMT tags within a tight (±5 ppm and ±3% NET) error window (RRT) to the number matching within a loose (±10 ppm and ±6% NET) error window (RRL). The overall false-positive rate of peptide identification was estimated by averaging the relative risks of all of the FTICR data sets.Genetic Manipulation of Chromosomal Genes of STM—The primers used for tagging or deleting chromosomal genes of STM were listed in Table 2. The procedures of gene tagging and deleting, which were mediated by phage λ-Red recombinase, were the same as those described previously (30Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10979) Google Scholar, 31Uzzau S. Figueroa-Bossi N. Rubino S. Bossi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15264-15269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). For gene tagging, the sequences encoding 3 × FLAG epitopes were inserted in-frame at the 3′-end of the coding regions immediately before the stop codons of all targeted STM genes. Gene deletion was carried out to eliminate the entire coding region of the target. After validation with PCR, the antibiotic resistance gene that served as a selective marker was removed to minimize polar effects. All resulting STM strains made in this study are listed in Table 1. The strains tagged with the 3 × FLAG epitope were used to validate the LC-MS results by WB analysis of the expression of each tagged STM proteins isolated from macrophages. The gene-deletion strain was tested to determine whether its ability to survive inside macrophages was attenuated.TABLE 2Primers used in this studyPrimerSequence2777TFACCGGGGCGGGCTTATTATGCCGGTGTGACGGCCTCGTTTGACTACAAAGACCATGACGG2777TKRCCGCCAGAATATGCCCGCCAGCGGCGGGCATAATCCATCACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG3117TFGGACCCTGATGGAAACTTAATTGAAATTTCGCAGTATGTTGACTACAAAGACCATGACGG3117TKRGTGATCATAATAAAGGCAGTAATAGTAAGTTTTAACATTACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG3117KFGTAGATGCAAAAAAAATGCATCTGATTTAAAAGTAGGTTAGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG3118TFGCAGCAACTTAGAGTAGATGCAAAAAAAATGCATCTGATTGACTACAAAGACCATGACGG3118TKRTAGGGATGCTACATTAAAAAATAGCATTAACCTACTTTTACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG3119TFTTATTGCTGTGGATGTTCGCCTGAAGAAGACGCCGCTTATGACTACAAAGACCATGACGG3119TKRTAACATTCATCATGACTCTAAACCTCAGGGCGATTTCTCACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG4319TFTAATTTATTGAGTAAAGAAGATCACCCCAAACTTAATTACGACTACAAAGACCATGACGG4319TKRCATTTGCTGTGGCCAGTTTGCGGGAAGACTTTCACCTTCACATATGAATATCCTCCTTAG Open table in a new tab Assay for Survival and Replication of STM inside Macrophages—As described above, the RAW macrophages, and WT and gene-deletion strains of STM were prepared 1 day before infection, with a slight modification in which RAW macrophages were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates. The infections were carried out with a multiplicity of infection of 100. At pre-determined time points, cells were washed twice with 1 ml/well of HBSS and lysed with 0.5 ml/well of cell lysis buffer (1% (v/v) of Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS in DPBS) at room temperature for 5 min. The lysis solution in each well was pipeted up and down 10 times and diluted by several orders of magnitude, and each dilution was plated on LB agar plates. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the numbers of colony-forming units on each LB agar plate were counted to determine the numbers of live STM cells in each well, and a minimum of three wells was counted for each measurement (32Rosenberg C.M. Finlay B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18753-18762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as means ± S.D. Student's t test was used for comparing groups.RESULTSIsolation of STM Cells from Infected Macrophages—Critical to the identification of functionally important proteins that mediate the colonization of macrophages by Salmonella is the enrichment of STM from infected host cells and the retention of STM associated proteins in a form suitable for LC-MS analysis. To accomplish this goal, we have used two complementary methods of STM isolation, which respectively rely on the gentle physical disruption of isolated cells to maintain organelle structures (method 1) and the differential solubilization of the host membranes by taking advantage of the detergent resistance of STM cells (method 2). For both methods, STM were isolated from WT (N-) macrophages at 2 h p.i., and the relative purity of the preparation and abundance of isolated STM proteins was compared using EM and LC-MS, respectively.EM examination of STM isolated by method 1 revealed large numbers of vesicle-like structures derived from organelles within macrophages that were co-isolated with STM cells (Fig. 1A). Consistent with these results, LC-MS analysis found that only 33.9 ± 0.7% of total identified proteins originated from the STM, whereas the remainder were mouse proteins (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, EM analysis of the isolated STM from method 2 indicates a highly purified preparation of STM cells with much fewer macrophage-derived vesicle-like structures (Fig. 1B). Indeed, MS analysis confirmed that 67.3 ± 3.4% of the total proteins prepared from this latter method were derived from STM. Furthermore, 74% of the bacterial proteins identified in method 1 were also found in the samples isolated by method 2. Given the much greater purity of the preparation obtained using method 2, and the ability to rapidly compare the time course of infection using this method to prepare multiple samples in parallel, subsequent measurements to investigate time-dependent changes in the abundances of STM proteins following bacterial internalization within macrophages emphasized this preparation.Modulation of Salmonella Colonization by Nramp1 Activity—Wild-type (N-) RAW 264.7 macrophages are rapidly colonized by STM cells, which remain viable for more than 24 h following their uptake into macrophages (Fig. 2A). In contrast, expression of Nramp1 in RAW 264.7 (i.e. N+) results in the rapid clearance of STM from macrophages. To identify proteins whose expression facilitates bacterial colonization of macrophages, we have isolated STM cells from both N- and N+ macrophages and have identified both bacter"

https://openalex.org/W2154300848,"Previously we discovered that NPY induces ischemic angiogenesis by activating Y2 and Y5 receptors. The receptors that mediate specific steps of the complex process of angiogenesis are unknown. Here, we studied in vitro NPY receptors subtypes involved in migration, proliferation, and differentiation of human endothelial cells. In cells that expressed Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptors, NPY bimodally stimulated migration and proliferation with a 2-fold increase at 10(-12) M and 10(-8) M (high- and low-affinity peaks, respectively). Preincubation of cells with NPY up-regulated the Y5 receptor and markedly enhanced endothelial cell migration and proliferation. NPY-induced endothelial cell migration was mimicked by agonists and fully blocked by antagonists for any specific NPY receptors (Y1, Y2, or Y5), while proliferation was blocked by any two antagonists (Y1+Y2, Y1+Y5, or Y2+Y5), and capillary tube formation on Matrigel was blocked by all three (Y1+Y2+Y5). Thus, NPY-induced angiogenesis requires participation of Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptor subtypes, with the Y5 receptor acting as an enhancer. We propose that these receptors form heteromeric complexes, and the Y1/Y2/Y5 receptor oligomer may be the uncloned Y3 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2130417288,"Innate immune system receptors function as sensors of infection and trigger the immune responses through ligand-specific signaling pathways. These ligands are pathogen-associated products, such as components of bacterial walls and viral nuclear acids. A common response to such ligands is the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38, whereas double-stranded viral RNA additionally induces the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). Here we have shown that p38 and eIF2α phosphorylation represent two biochemical markers of the effects induced by N-(3-oxo-acyl)homoserine lactones, the secreted products of a number of Gram-negative bacteria, including the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Furthermore, N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)homoserine lactone induced distension of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum as well as c-jun gene transcription. These effects occurred in a wide variety of cell types including alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, requiring the structural integrity of the lactone ring motif and its natural stereochemistry. These findings suggest that N-(3-oxo-acyl)homoserine lactones might be recognized by receptors of the innate immune system. However, we provide evidence that N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)homoserine lactone-mediated signaling does not require the presence of the canonical innate immune system receptors, Toll-like receptors, or two members of the NLR/Nod/Caterpillar family, Nod1 and Nod2. These data offer a new understanding of the effects of N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)homoserine lactone on host cells and its role in persistent airway infections caused by P. aeruginosa.

Although TIR domain-containing adaptors, known as MyD88, TIRAP/MAL, TRAM, and TRIF/TICAM-1, may form homo- and heterodimers, the signal transduction of most known PAMPs requires the involvement of MyD88, TRIF, or both (6Beutler B.

For example, both adaptors are essential for signaling mediated by the Gram-negative bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a TLR4-specific PAMP, whereas MyD88 is required for the TLR9-specific PAMPs, and TRIF is used in TLR3-specific manner. Common characteristics of MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways include activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) including p38. An additional unique feature of TRIF-dependent signaling is the attenuation of protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) (3Janeway C.A.

Moreover, they are essential to the pathogenesis of the microbe, and structurally invariant PAMPs are shared by groups of pathogens. Examples of bacterial PAMPs include LPS, peptidoglycan, unmethylated CpG motifs present in DNA, and viral nucleic acids (13Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar).

Immunol. 2001; 167: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that C12 may function as a PAMP. However, no studies have directly addressed this possibility. We performed biochemical and genetic analyses to identify signaling pathways and cellular organelles responsive to C12 with respect to PRR-dependent mechanisms by using primary cells and cell lines of different origin, including a panel of single and double knock-out bone marrow-derived macrophages. Our results reveal that C12 treatment of myeloid or non-myeloid cells results in the morphological alteration of mitochondria and especially endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and that the phosphorylated forms of p38 (P-p38) and eIF2α (P-eIF2α) are two major biochemical markers indicative of the C12 responsiveness of diverse cell types. Evidence is provided here that the N-(3-oxo-acyl)homoserine lactone ring motif of C12 is required for the induction of phosphorylated p38 and eIF2α and that similar phosphorylation of both proteins is also activated by other members of the AHL family containing this structural motif. We also examined these responses in macrophages obtained from mice bearing targeted gene deletions in components that are essential for signaling induced by canonical PAMPs of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. We demonstrate that MyD88, TRIF, TLR2, TLR4, Nod1, and Nod2 are dispensable for the C12-mediated signaling. These observations unveil C12 as a paradigm for a new class of PAMPs acting independently of canonical PRR-mediated mechanisms. Mice, Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages, and Other Cells— TLR2-/-, TLR4-/-, MyD88-/- mice were received from S. Akira; TRIF-deficient lps2 mice were from B. Beutler; and Nod1/2-/- double knock-out mice were generated by crossing Nod1-/- mice (from T. Mak) with Nod2-/- mice (from R. Flavell). C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All knock-out mice were of the C57BL/6 background. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were obtained from Cambrex and cultured as recommended by the manufacturer. L929/NCTC clone 929 (connective tissue, mouse), THP-1 (monocyte, human), RAW 264.7 (monocyte-macrophage, mouse), and WI-38 (SV40-transformed human lung fibroblasts; CCL-75.1) cell lines were purchased from ATCC. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared using standard protocols. Alveolar macrophages were isolated from C57BL/6 mice as described (26Steinhauser M.L. Hogaboam C.M. Kunkel S.L. Lukacs N.W. Strieter R.M. Standiford T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 392-399PubMed Google Scholar). MEFs and cell lines were maintained in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen)). BMDM were cultured in 70% growth medium and 30% L929 conditioned medium. NHBE were cultured in small airway epithelial cell basal medium (SABM; Cambrex) supplemented with 30 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.5 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 0.5 μg/ml epinephrine, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.1 ng/ml retinoic acid, 6.5 ng/ml triiodothyronine, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 0.5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. In general, cells (∼60-70% confluency) were incubated in corresponding fresh medium for 12-14 h before stimulation. Reagents and Antibodies—N-(3-Oxododecanoyl)-S- and -R-homoserine lactone (C12 and C12R, respectively), N-butyryl-S-homoserine lactone (BHL), 3-oxo-dodecanoic acid (2-oxo-pyrrolidin-3-yl)-amide (lactam, C12-LM), (S)-3-(1-hydroxydecylidene)-5-(2-hyroxyethyl) pyrrolidine-2,4-dione (C12-TA), N-(3-oxodecanoyl)-S-homoserine lactone (C10), and N-(3-oxotetradecanoyl)-S-homoserine lactone (C14) were synthesized and purified as described previously (27Kaufmann G.F. Sartorio R. Lee S.H. Rodgers C.J. Meijler M.M. Moss J.A. Clapham B. Brogan A.P. Dickerson T.J. Janda K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The purity of all of these synthetic compounds was greater than 99% and was confirmed by HPLC/mass spectrometry analysis. All synthetic molecules were dissolved in Me2SO at 200× the desired concentration, and aliquots were stored at -20 °C. In addition, a quantitative QCL-1,000 chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) demonstrated that preparations of C10, C12, C12R, C12-LM, C12-TA, C14, and BHL were endotoxin-free. 4-Hydroxy-2-(3-oxo-dodecanoylamino)butyric acid (C12-hyd) was prepared by incubation of C12 in aqueous solution (pH 10) at 37 °C for 24 h. Under these conditions greater then 85% of C12 was converted to C12-hyd, which was confirmed by HPLC/mass spectrometry analysis. Salmonella minnesota Re595 LPS was prepared as described previously (28Mathison J.C. Virca G.D. Wolfson E. Tobias P.S. Glaser K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 85: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), phospho-p38 (P-p38), P-eIF2α, P-JNK, P-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, caspase-9, the cleaved form of caspase-3, and actin (from Sigma) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling and used in Western blot analysis as recommended by the manufacturer. Northern Blot—Total RNA was isolated by using TRizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was analyzed by Northern blot as described previously (29Kravchenko V.K. Mathison J.C. Schwamborn K. Mercurio F. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26612-26619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with specific antisense oligonucleotides end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. Electron Microscopy—Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes as described above. After treatment of cells with a compound or 0.5% Me2SO as a control, samples for electron microscopy analysis were prepared as described (30Tan S. Wood M. Maher P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 96-105Google Scholar). Images were documented on a Philips CM100 electron microscope (FEI, Hillsborough, OR). Data Presentation—Data shown in each figure are representative of three or more experiments Phosphorylated p38 and eIF2α Are Two Biochemical Markers Indicative of Homoserine Lactone-mediated Signaling—Macrophages are a key effector cell type of the innate immune system. Treatment of these cells with PAMPs induces several signaling events including the phosphorylation of MAPK p38, a shared marker of Nod-dependent as well as MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling pathways, and/or the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α, a biochemical marker indicative of TRIF-dependent signaling. Therefore, we reasoned that the determination of the effects of C12 on the phosphorylation state of p38 and eIF2a would be appropriate markers for our initial studies to investigate possible PAMP-like signaling of C12 in macrophages. Exposure of BMDM to C12 resulted in time- and dose-dependent induction of p38 and eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B, P-p38 and P-eIF2α). These observed biochemical effects were highly specific for the naturally occurring S-stereoisomer of C12, because no biochemical effects were observed after the addition of the unnatural R-stereoisomer of C12 (Fig. 1C, C12R). Interestingly, induction of P-p38 and P-eIF2α could also be detected after treatment with other members of the 3-oxo-AHL family such as C10 and C14 (Fig. 1, D and E). However, BHL, another AHL also synthesized by P. aeruginosa, was found to be inactive (Fig. 1D). Additionally, the lactam congener of the C12 lactone, C12-LM, failed to induce these biochemical changes (see Fig. 1, D and E). Taken together, these data suggest that the integrity of the homoserine lactone ring motif is required to induce distinct cellular events leading to P-p38 and P-eIF2α. In aqueous conditions at neutral pH ∼7.4, the C12 lactone ring can undergo two different non-enzymatic reactions: 1) reversible hydrolysis generating the corresponding carboxylic acid (C12-hyd); 2) an irreversible Claisen-like reaction resulting in the conversion of C12 to a tetramic acid (C12-TA) (Fig. 2A). As the cell culture media usually has a pH ∼7.4, both C12-hyd and C12-TA could be generated under our experimental conditions after the addition of C12. Indeed, HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that C12-hyd is rapidly generated after the addition of C12 to the cells, and its presence is seen in both supernatant and cellular fractions (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the cellular fractions contained approximately 10 times more C12-hyd than C12, whereas C12 was predominantly distributed in the supernatant (Fig. 2B). Notably, a 30-s treatment of macrophages with C12 was sufficient to induce P-p38 as well as P-eIF2α, as detected 15 min later (Fig. 2C), suggesting that association of C12, C12-hyd, or both with the cells is required for these signaling events. However, the initial integrity of C12 is a prerequisite for the induction of P-p38 and P-eIF2α, because C12-hyd, C12-TA, and C12-LM all lost this ability (Fig. 2D). Because previous studies had shown that prolonged incubation of transformed human cells with C12 induces the cleavage of PARP (23Li L. Hooi D. Chhabra S.R. Pritchard D. Shaw P.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), a biochemical marker indicative of apoptosis (31Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3802) Google Scholar), investigations were warranted to determine whether the integrity of the homoserine lactone ring motif is also required for induction of PARP cleavage in macrophages. As expected, Western blot analysis showed that C12, but not C12-hyd, C12-TA, or C12-LM, induces the cleavage of PARP (see Fig. 2D). Thus, the structural integrity of the homoserine lactone ring motif is required for C12-mediated induction of apoptotic pathways as well as phosphorylation of p38 and eIF2α. Comparison of C12-induced Effects on Myeloid and Non-myeloid Cells—Our observations that treatment of BMDM with C12 induces the cleavage of PARP as well as phosphorylation of p38 and eIF2α prompted investigations of whether C12 has the ability to activate similar signaling events in other cell types. Based on the clinical observation that P. aeruginosa is a common causative agent of chronic lung infections in humans, alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells were examined for their response to C12. These experiments confirmed that the induction of PARP cleavage, P-p38, and P-eIF2α are characteristic markers of the general cellular responses to C12 as observed in various cell types, including primary alveolar macrophages and normal lung epithelial cells (Fig. 3A). Importantly, C12-induced phosphorylation of p38 and eIF2α was very rapid and evident in all cell types. However, significantly delayed kinetics and reduction of the extent of PARP cleavage were observed in cells of non-hematopoietic origin (see Fig. 3A). Additionally, dose titration experiments revealed that C12 significantly affects the viability of macrophages when compared with non-myeloid cells such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts (Fig. 3, B and D). MyD88, TRIF, TLR2, TLR4 Nod1, and Nod2 Are Not Required for C12-mediated Signaling in Macrophages—Macrophages are activated though a variety of PAMPs recognized by specific PRRs. Four adaptor proteins, MyD88, TRIF, MAL/TI-RAP, and TRAM, are involved in TLR-dependent signal transduction events. However, there are very specific patterns of adaptor protein usage; TLR2 uses MyD88 and TIRAP; TLR3 signals through TRIF; and TLR4 utilizes all four; the rest of the known TLRs, including TLR5 and TLR7-9, appear to require only MyD88. In keeping with our observations that the effects of C12 mimic the activation of MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways, experiments were conducted to determine whether MyD88 or TRIF are required for C12-mediated phosphorylation of p38 and eIF2α as well as induction of PARP cleavage. Examination of the responses in BMDM from mice with genetic defects in MyD88 or TRIF function revealed that C12 induction of PARP cleavage, P-p38, and P-eIF2α was identical in the BMDM from the adaptor protein-deficient and control mice (Fig. 4A). Thus, neither MyD88 nor TRIF is required for the C12-mediated biochemical signaling events. Additionally, these findings suggest that TLR3, TLR5, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are not involved in the recognition and transduction of the C12 signal. We cannot exclude the possibility that MyD88 and TRIF are both required for the full C12 response, but at present we consider this possibility very unlikely. We also asked whether TLR2 or TLR4 are required for C12-mediated signaling because both receptors have the ability to recognize molecules containing long-chain fatty acid moieties. Comparison of the C12-mediated biochemical changes in TLR2-/-, TRL4-/-, or control BMDM failed to reveal any differences in the response to C12 in this panel of BMDM (Fig. 4B). The intracellular proteins Nod1 and Nod2 have been implicated in innate immune responses distinct from those mediated by the TLRs (2Meylan E. Tschopp J. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 442: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 3Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6232) Google Scholar, 4Inohara N. Chamaillard M. McDonald C. Nunez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Thus, we also examined BMDM from mice lacking both Nod1 and Nod2 and observed that C12-induced phosphorylation of p38, eIF2α, and PARP cleavage was identical in the BMDM from Nod1/2-deficient and control mice (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that the Nod1 and Nod2 proteins are not required for the initial recognition and signaling events of C12 in macrophages. In total, these observations suggest that C12 signals through TLR- and NLR-independent pathways and raise the possibility that C12 affects signaling pathways in a manner distinct from TLR-specific PAMPs. LPS is a major TLR-specific PAMP present in P. aeruginosa, and hence, we compared the responses of macrophages to C12 and LPS. As a well known TLR4 agonist, LPS induces signaling through MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways (5Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 6Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Among the signaling events examined, the phosphorylation of p38 was the only response induced by both LPS and C12, although with different kinetic patterns (Fig. 5A). Particularly interesting is the opposite effect of these stimuli on the MAPKs p44 and p42, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Although LPS treatment resulted in the induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (P-ERK1/2), the basal levels of P-ERK1/2 were down-regulated in response to C12. The consequences of these differences between LPS- and C12-mediated signaling events were further investigated by the examination of mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), interferon β (IFN-β), cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) and cellular proto-oncogene c-jun, genes that are induced in LPS-stimulated cells (11Yamamoto M.

The levels of TNF, MIP-2, IFN-β, and Cox-2 mRNAs were increased after LPS treatment, whereas C12 failed to induce these transcripts (Fig. 5B). Additionally, although LPS treatment resulted in weak and transient induction of c-jun mRNA, a robust and prolonged increase in the level of c-jun mRNA was observed after C12 treatment, indicating that C12-mediated signaling results in the transcriptional activation of the gene encoding the c-Jun protein, a key regulator of proliferation and apoptosis (34Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar, 35Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L.

To confirm and extend the findings obtained using BMDM we also examined C12 or LPS induction of c-jun and genes encoding the inflammatory modulators MCP-1, IP-10, Cox-2, and IL-8 in non-myeloid cell types. As was expected for LPS responsiveness in MEFs (29Kravchenko V.K. Mathison J.C. Schwamborn K. Mercurio F. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26612-26619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32Covert M.W. Leung T.H. Gaston J.E. Baltimore D. Science. 2005; 309: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), the levels of MCP-1, IP-10, and Cox-2 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and the level of c-jun mRNA was slightly increased (Fig. 5C). Importantly, although C12 treatment did not induce MCP-1, IP-10, and Cox-2 mRNAs, c-jun mRNA was strongly induced after C12 treatment of MEFs (Fig. 5C). Similar results were observed when C12 or TNF induction of mRNAs for IL-8, Cox-2, and c-Jun was examined in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 5D). However, transformed human lung fibroblasts (WI-38) showed an increase in the levels of IL-8 and Cox-2 mRNAs after treatment with C12 (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, the kinetics and levels of C12- and TNF-induced Cox-2 mRNAs were comparable, whereas extremely weak and delayed IL-8 induction was found in C12-treated WI-38 cells (Fig. 5E, upper panel). Nevertheless, the C12-induced level of c-jun mRNA was quite similar in all cell types including WI-38 cells (Fig. 5, B"

The UPR is proximally sensed and transduced by four major ER-transmembrane effector proteins: protein kinases Ire1α and Ire1β, PERK, and a membrane-bound transcription factor ATF6 (activating transcription factor-6) (1Harding H.P.

The UPR coordinates two major functions: 1) transcriptional regulation of specific targets and 2) translational repression. The transcriptional arm of the UPR is mediated largely by Ire1-dependent signaling in concert with ATF6; together these factors induce ER chaperones to remedy protein misfolding (5Yoshida H.

Science. 2006; 313: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Translational regulation is executed by PERK, which phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) on serine 51 to block assembly of an active 43 S translation initiation complex thus contributing to translation repression to reduce ER protein load (4Harding H.P.

Independent of eIF2α, PERK also phosphorylates NF-E2-related factor 2 to regulate expression of redox enzymes necessary to restore redox homeostasis and thereby contribute to cell adaptation to ER stress (10Cullinan S.B.

One critical PERK function is the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis, which is mediated by transcriptional effectors activating transcription factor-4 and NF-E2-related factor 2 (10Cullinan S.B.

PERK signaling also coordinates cell cycle arrest, which reduces energy consumption and allows cells to divert resources to re-establish homeostasis. The UPR-associated cell cycle arrest correlates with PERK-dependent attenuation of cyclin D1 protein synthesis. Cyclin D1 loss leads to subsequent repression of cyclin D1-dependent CDK4 activity. Loss of D1/CDK4 complex also allows for the redistribution of p21Cip1 to CDK2, thereby triggering the G1/S checkpoint (17Brewer J.W. Hendershot L.M. Sherr C.J. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because ribosome biogenesis is the major biosynthetic and energy-consuming activity of eukaryotic cells, it is sensitive to the availability of nutrients and growth factors (19Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that ribosome biogenesis is intimately coupled to cell cycle progression through regulation of the Hdm2/p53 signaling (20Pestov D.G. Strezoska Z. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4246-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 21Strezoska Z. Pestov D.G. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

Induction of the tumor suppressor Arf (alternative reading frame) contributes to inhibition of rRNA processing, while simultaneously binding to and inhibiting Hdm2, which leads to p53 induction and cell cycle arrest (22Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Therefore, Arf coordinates ribosome biogenesis with the cell cycle in response to oncogenic stress (23Sugimoto M. Kuo M.L. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of a mutant Bop1, a nucleolar protein critical for rRNA processing and ribosome assembly, triggers p53 activation and induces cell cycle arrest at G1 phase (20Pestov D.G. Strezoska Z. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4246-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 21Strezoska Z. Pestov D.G. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

More tellingly, low doses of actinomycin D, which inhibit rRNA synthesis thereby interfering with ribosome assembly, leads to enhanced association between ribosome proteins (rpL5, rpL11, and rpL23) and Hdm2. The increased binding to Hdm2 inhibits p53 ubiquitination thereby triggering cell cycle arrest (24Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol.

Because the UPR reduces active polysomes through eIF2α phosphorylation, we considered this signal might also lead to increased association between ribosomal proteins and Hdm2 thereby leading to p53 activation. We have evaluated the ability of both physiological (glucose deprivation) and pharmacological (tunicamycin) triggers of ER stress to activate p53. Our data reveal that UPR induction by glucose deprivation or tunicamycin treatment triggers p53 accumulation and activation in a PERK-dependent manner. Activation of p53 is due to reduced Hdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Inhibition of Hdm2 correlates with increased association of Hdm2 with the ribosomal proteins (rpL5, rpL11, and rpL23). Activation of p53 contributes to cell cycle arrest, because cells lacking a functional p53 allele or its downstream target p21cip1 are refractory to cell cycle arrest in response to ER stress. Therefore, UPR activation induces ribosomal stress, which directly contributes to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. Cell Culture—HCT116 p53+/+, HCT116 p53-/-, HCT116 p21cip1+/+, and p21cip1-/- cells were gifts from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and cultured in McCoy5A media with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. PERK-Flox/Flox mice were a gift from Dr. Douglas Cavener (Dept. of Biology, Pennsylvania State University). U2OS and Saos-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin.

Vousden (Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, UK). PERK K618-myc/pcDNA was previously described (18Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). WT PERK/pCS2+MT was cloned from PERK WT/pcDNA using the 5′-primer, CAAACAACAGAATTCAATGGAGCGCGCCACCCG, and 3′-primer, ACACCACCCCTCGAGCTAGTTGCCAGGCAGTGG. ΔC2 PERK-myc was cloned from WT PERK/pCS2+MT using the 5′-primer, CAAACAACAGAATTCAATGGAGCGCGCCACCCG, and 3′-primer, ACACCACCCCTCGAGTCAAAAATCTGTTAGATATCG. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), 10 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To detect interactions between ectopically expressed proteins, U2OS or 293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors and treated as indicated. Transfection efficiency was routinely monitored by cotransfecting with a vector encoding enhanced GFP. Cells were lysed in EBC buffer as described above, and 1000-1500 μg of total protein lysate was used for immunoprecipitation. FLAG-rpL23 was immunoprecipitated with the M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), T7-Hdm2 was immunoprecipitated with the T7 tag antibody (Novagen), and endogenous Hdm2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Mdm2 (Ab-3) antibody (Calbiochem). Total cell lysates (for direct Western blot analysis), or immunoprecipitated complexes and whole cell lysates (for immunoprecipitation analysis) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics) for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies: anti-human p53 (DO-1, Calbiochem), p53 (FL-393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-p53 (Ser15, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), phospho-eIF2α (Ser-51, Cell signaling Technology), total eIF2α (Cell signaling Technology), p21Cip1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CHOP/GADD153 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Hdm2 (2A10, a gift from Dr. Jason D. Weber, Washington University); Hdm2 (4B11, Calbiochem), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K antibody (a gift from Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss, Dept. of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center); and L11 rabbit polyclonal antibody (a gift from Karen H. Vousden, Beatson Institute for Cancer Research). FLAG-rpL23 was detected by using anti-FLAG (Sigma); T7-Hdm2 was detected by using T7 tag antibody (Novagen); GFP-rpL5 was detected by using anti-GFP (JL-8, Clontech). For quantification of immunoblot, the secondary antibody used were AlexaFluor 680-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and bands were scanned and quantified using the Odyssey version 1.0 software on the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager. Protein levels for p53 or p21 were normalized with loading control and represented % or -fold increase over basal. Data represent at least three independent experiments done in triplicate, with error bars representing standard deviations. Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis—HCT116 p53+/+ or p53-/- cells were cultured in glucose-free, or low glucose (0.5 mm glucose) media for 16 h. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was made from 2 μg of total RNA using Superscript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis System for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). These cDNA were then analyzed using quantitative PCR. Gene expression was standardized to 18 S RNA levels using a commercially available primer/probe set (ABI), labeled with a fluorescent dye (6-carboxyfluorescein or JOE) and a quencher (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine). Expression of p21cip1, p27, and Noxa was then determined using SYBR fluorescence and the following primers: p21Cip1 F, AGCAGAGGAAGACCATGTGGAC; p21Cip1 R, TTTCGACCCTGAGAGTCTCCAG; p27 F, TTGGAGAAGCACTGCAGAGACA; p27 R, TCCACCTCTTGCCACTCGTACT; Noxa F, ACAAACTGAACTTCCGGCAGAA; and Noxa R, TTTGAAGGAGTCCCCTCATGC. Taqman and SYBR green master mix solutions were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). SYBR green-labeled primer/probe pairs for p21cip1, p27, and Noxa were custom-designed and obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (University of Pennsylvania Cell Center). All reactions were performed in triplicate, and all experiments were performed at least three times in a 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosciences). Changes in threshold signal versus 18 S RNA control (ΔcT) calculations were used to calculate relative mRNA levels. Error bars represent standard deviation. Cre-retrovirus Infection and Genotyping of Cre-floxed PERK—The retrovirus construct for pBabe-Cre was a gift from Dr. Kay-Uwe Wagner (University of Nebraska). Retrovirus production and infection were carried out as previously described (18Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). PERK Flox/Flox MEFs (1 × 106/60-mm dish) were derived as previously described (30Kamijo T. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Quelle D.E. Downing J.R. Ashmun R.A. Grosveld G. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with control pBabe-puro or pBabe-Cre retrovirus 72 h before harvesting for genotyping or replaced with glucose-free media for the indicated intervals followed by harvesting and immunoblotting. For geno-typing the WT or Cre-floxed PERK allele, a combination of the following four primers were used: mPERK 1229F, CATCCCCATCAGCCTGTTTG; mPERK 1527F, TCTTGGTTGGGTCTGATGAAT; mPERK 1709R, GATGTTCTTGCTGTAGTGTGGGGG; and mPERK 568R, GGTCAAGGAAGGCAGATAGGAAAG. 1527F/1709R gives the 453-bp band as the WT allele; 1229F/568R gives the 704-bp band as the Cre-floxed allele. [35S]Methionine Labeling—Subconfluent HCT116 p53+/+ cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 6 h, or left untreated prior to culturing in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) for the final 30 min of treatment. Cells were pulse-labeled with medium (with or without tunicamycin) containing 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine-cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) for the indicated intervals, lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 4 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and p53 was precipitated from cell lysates with anti-human p53 antibody (DO-1, Calbiochem). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—U2OS cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were treated with MG132 (20 μm) for 6 h; cells were either switched to glucose-free media or treated with tunicamycin (5 μg/ml) or thapsigargin (1 μm) for the last4hof MG132 treatment prior to harvesting with cold PBS. 10% was used to make whole cell lysates in EBC buffer; the remaining 90% were lysed in buffer 1 (6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 5 mm imidazole. Cleared lysates were incubated with Talon affinity beads (BD Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then sequentially washed with buffer 1, buffer 2 (8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), buffer 3 (8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris (pH 6.3), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and buffer 4 (8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris (pH 6.3), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100). All buffers were supplemented with N-ethylmaleimide. Bound proteins were eluded in sample buffer supplemented with 100 mm imidazole and resolved via SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (Osmonics), the presence of p53 and T7-Hdm2 was detected with anti-p53 and anti-T7 anti-bodies, respectively. Cell Lysate Fractionation—Nucleolar and nucleoplasmic fractions were isolated from MEFs or U2OS cells as previously described with slight modification (31Bhat K.P. Itahana K. Jin A. Zhang Y. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2402-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Control or glucose-starved MEFs or U2OS cells from two 150-mm dishes were trypsinized, pelleted, washed with PBS, and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of RSB buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.01 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and placed on ice for 10 min. Swollen cells were then collected by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 8 min, and resuspended in 1 ml of RSB buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cell membranes were then broken using a Dounce homogenizer (tight pestle) by 10 up and down strokes. Nuclei (pellet) were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 8 min and resuspended in 0.75 ml of 0.25 m sucrose/10 mm MgCl2, overlaid onto 1 ml of 0.88 m sucrose/0.05 mm MgCl2, and purified by centrifugation again at 2,500 rpm for 10 min. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.34 m sucrose/0.05 mm MgCl2 and sonicated for 60 s with 10-s intervals. The sonicated cell lysate was then overlaid onto 1 ml of 0.88 m sucrose/0.05 mm MgCl2 and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 20 min. The pellet contained the purified nucleoli, and the supernatant represented the nucleoplasm. All buffers contained protease inhibitors added freshly before use. BrdUrd/PI Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—Cells were treated with tunicamycin, or shifted to glucose free or low glucose media for the indicated time, and incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd for the final hour. After washing with PBS, cells were trypsinized, suspended in 300 μl of PBS and 700 μl of 100% ethanol, and fixed overnight at -20 °C. Cells were incubated with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse antibody before being incubated with propidium iodide (PI, 10 μg/ml in PBS) and scanned by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) to determine the proliferating S phase (BrdUrd-positive population) and DNA content (by PI staining). ER Stress Triggers p53 Activation and p21Cip1 Induction—To evaluate the impact of ER stress on p53 accumulation and induction of downstream targets, p53-proficient HCT116 cells were cultured in glucose-free media or in complete media supplemented with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin and analyzed by immunoblot. In the absence of glucose, p53 accumulation was apparent by 3 h, with strong induction by 16 h (Fig. 1A). p53 accumulation was accompanied by induction of the p53 target p21Cip1 (Fig. 1A, middle panel). Tunicamycin-dependent p53 induction was also associated with p21Cip1 accumulation (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the published data (32Qu L. Huang S. Baltzis D. Rivas-Estilla A.M. Pluquet O. Hatzoglou M. Koumenis C. Taya Y. Yoshimura A. Koromilas A.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 261-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) we noted increased Ser-15 phosphorylation of p53 following glucose deprivation (Fig. 1, B, C, and E). Tunicamycin treatment also promoted p53 accumulation by 16 h, although we noted that at early time points (3 h) p53 levels were slightly decreased, but were clearly induced at later time points (16 h) (Fig. 1A). The p21Cip1 induction was significantly attenuated in p53-/- HCT116 (Fig. 1B, right panel), suggesting p53-dependence. We also evaluated p53 induction in p53 wild-type U2OS and primary MEFs to ensure our results did not reflect cell type specificity. Glucose deprivation triggered p53 accumulation and p21Cip1 induction in both U2OS cells and MEFs (Fig. 1, C-E), accompanied by increased phospho-p53 (Ser-15), demonstrating that ER stress by glucose deprivation leads to p53 accumulation and activation in multiple types of cells. The induction of p21Cip1 upon p53 accumulation suggests that p53 is transcriptionally active. To determine whether p21cip1 induction occurs at the level of gene expression and to evaluate the role of p53 in this induction, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to measure both p21cip1 and Noxa, another p53 target gene (33Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar) in either p53+/+ or p53-/- HCT116 cells. A 5-fold induction of p21cip1 mRNA was evident by 16 h of glucose deprivation (Fig. 1F). This induction was significantly attenuated in p53-/- cells. Noxa mRNA was also stimulated by glucose-deprivation in a p53-dependent manner (Fig. 1F). As a negative control, we assessed mRNA levels of a non-p53 target, p27kip1 (Fig. 1F). These data demonstrate that glucose restriction triggers p53 accumulation and p53-dependent activation of downstream targets including p21cip1 and Noxa. Glucose Deprivation Activates p53 in a PERK-dependent Manner—We have previously demonstrated that the ER-associated kinase, PERK, plays a critical role in the regulation of cell cycle progression following ER stress (17Brewer J.W. Hendershot L.M. Sherr C.J. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8505-8510Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Brewer J.W. Diehl J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12625-12630Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We used two approaches to assess whether PERK regulates p53 induction. In the first, we utilized a PERK mutant that lacks the C-terminal kinase domain but retains the N-terminal dimerization domain allowing it to inhibit endogenous PERK activity. Dominant negative PERK (DN PERK) was expressed in p53+/+ HCT116 cells, and p53 and p21Cip1 protein levels were assessed by immunoblot following a time course of tunicamycin treatment (data not shown) or glucose starvation. Induction of eIF2α phosphorylation was blocked by DN PERK expression demonstrating efficacy of this molecule (Fig. 2A, second panel). The increase in basal phospho-eIF2α likely reflects an increase in oxidative stress due to inhibition of PERK signaling (10Cullinan S.B. Diehl J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). UPR-triggered accumulation of both p53 and p21Cip1 was attenuated by DN PERK (Fig. 2, A and B), strongly suggesting that PERK is essential for UPR-induced p53 activation. As a complementary approach, the PERK Flox/Cre system was utilized to delete PERK in primary MEFs (34Zhang P. McGrath B. Li S. Frank A. Zambito F. Reinert J. Gannon M. Ma K. McNaughton K. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3864-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). PERK Flox/Flox MEFs were infected with retrovirus encoding Cre or empty virus control. PERK was indeed excised as determined by PCR (data not shown). PERK protein levels were reduced by ∼80% as determined by Western analysis (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Accumulation of phospho-eIF2α was blocked in pBabe-Creinfected cells consistent with loss of PERK (Fig. 2C). In the control mock-infected cells, p53 levels were significantly increased by4hof glucose deprivation, and remained elevated at 8 h; however, p53 levels in pBabe-Cre-infected cells did not increase throughout the time course (Fig. 2, C and D). The absence of p53 elevation is not due to increased basal p53 levels as actinomycin D (5 nm) still triggered a robust p53 accumulation in Cre-infected cells as it did in the control cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data strongly support the PERK dependence of p53 accumulation and activation by the UPR. Glucose Deprivation Inhibits Hdm2-mediated p53 Ubiquitination and Degradation—To determine whether p53 accumulation reflects decreased p53 ubiquitination, we assessed p53 polyubiquitination following induction of ER stress. U2OS cells transfected with a vector encoding His-tagged ubiquitin were mock treated or subjected to ER stress and treated with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, for 6 h. His-ubiquitinated proteins were collected on Talon resin, and accumulation of polyubiquitinated p53 was determined by immunoblot. Polyubiquitination of endogenous p53, characterized by a smear-like ladder, was enhanced by overexpression of T7-Hdm2 (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Upon UPR induction by either"

This study uses deletion mutagenesis to identify regions of p22phox required for maturation of gp91phox and for NADPH oxidase activity. N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal deletions of human p22phox were generated and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells with transgenes for gp91phox and two other NADPH oxidase subunits, p47phox, and p67phox. The results demonstrate that p22phox-dependent maturation of gp91phox carbohydrate, cell surface expression of gp91phox, and the enzymatic function of flavocytochrome b558 are closely correlated. Whereas the 5 N-terminal and 25 C-terminal amino acids are dispensable for these functions, the N-terminal 11 amino acids of p22phox are required, as is a hydrophilic region between amino acids 65 and 90. Upon deletion of 54 residues at the C terminus of p22phox (amino acids 142–195), maturation and cell surface expression of gp91phox was still preserved, although NADPH oxidase activity was absent, as expected, due to removal of a proline-rich domain between amino acids 151–160 that is required for recruitment of p47phox. Antibody binding studies indicate that the extreme N terminus of p22phox is inaccessible in the absence of cell permeabilization, supporting a model in which both the N- and C-terminal domains of p22phox extend into the cytoplasm, anchored by two membrane-embedded regions.

Antibody binding studies indicate that the extreme N terminus of p22phox is inaccessible in the absence of cell permeabilization, supporting a model in which both the N- and C-terminal domains of p22phox extend into the cytoplasm, anchored by two membrane-embedded regions. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADPH to generate the superoxide radical (O–2), the precursor to additional reactive oxidants with potent microbicidal properties. The importance of this enzyme in innate immunity and inflammation is illustrated by chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), 3The abbreviations used are: CGD, chronic granulomatous disease; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBSG, phosphate-buffered saline with glucose; phox, phagocyte oxidase; PRR, proline-rich region; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. a syndrome characterized by absent NADPH oxidase activity, recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, and chronic inflammatory granulomas (1Dinauer M. Nathan and Oski's Hematology of Infancy and Childhood. 6th Ed. W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia2003: 923-1010Google Scholar). The focal point for oxidase assembly is the phagocyte-specific flavocytochrome b558, a heterodimer comprised of two integral membrane proteins, gp91phox, a 91-kDa glycoprotein encoded by an X-linked gene that is the site of mutations in X-linked CGD, and p22phox, a non-glycosylated peptide derived from an autosomal CGD locus (1Dinauer M.

Initiation of electron transport through flavocytochrome b to produce O–2 at plasma or phagosome membranes requires activation and translocation of Rac-GTP and two cytosolic phox subunits, p47phox and p67phox, which are affected in two other autosomal recessive forms of CGD. The gp91phox and p22phox subunits of the flavocytochrome b heterodimer are closely associated and, in phagocytic cells, co-purify unless denatured (4Parkos C. Allen R. Cochrane C. Jesaitis A. J.

The hydrophilic C-terminal portion of this 570 amino acid subunit contains an NADPH-binding site and bears a flavin group that acts as the initial acceptor of a pair of electrons from NADPH (7Segal A.

There are multiple hydrophobic regions in p22phox, including two in the N-terminal portion of the polypeptide, that could potentially form up to four membrane spanning domains (e.g. Refs. 6Groemping Y.

However, the combined evidence from previous antibody and proteolysis experiments, computational predictions and newly described p22phox monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) suggests that extensive N-terminal regions of p22phox are intracytoplasmic, with two membrane-spanning domains located between amino acids 90 and 127 (18Taylor R.M.

The p22phox subunit also contains a single invariant histidine, His94, which is dispensable for heme binding and cytochrome b558 function (31Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. Yu L. Stull N.

Additional studies indicate that the biosynthesis and assembly of the flavocytochrome b subunits are closely linked. Heterodimer formation and heme incorporation are important for stable expression of gp91phox and p22phox in phagocytes, and both polypeptides are absent from CGD patients with null mutations in either flavocytochrome b subunit (1Dinauer M. Nathan and Oski's Hematology of Infancy and Childhood. 6th Ed. W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia2003: 923-1010Google Scholar). gp91phox is cotranslationally glycosylated and first detected as a high mannose 65-kDa monomer in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Full maturation of gp91phox requires sequential incorporation of heme into the 65-kDa precursor, heterodimerization with p22phox, which occurs in the late ER, and addition of N-linked oligosaccharides in the Golgi prior to transport to the plasma membrane, and, in neutrophils, specific granules (14Biberstine-Kinkade K.J.

Despite recent progress, additional work is needed to augment our understanding of the overall domain structure of p22phox and associated functions in flavocytochrome b558 biosynthesis and in NADPH oxidase activity. In this study we analyze the properties of N-terminal, C-terminal or internal deletion mutants of human p22phox, taking advantage of heterologous CHO cells engineered to express wild-type or mutant p22phox in the presence of wild-type gp91phox, p47phox, and p67phox. Reagents and Antibodies—Bovine growth serum (BGS) was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories (South Logan, UT). Ham's F12K medium was purchased from Invitrogen (Carls-bad, CA). mAbs 54.1 and 7D5 against gp91phox and 44.1, CS9, NS2, and NS5 against p22phox were previously described (18Taylor R.M. Burritt J.B.

Anti-Myc mAb was from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). Alexa fluor 488 (goat anti-mouse IgG) was from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen (Eugene, OR). All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Construction of p22phox Deletion Mutants—Deletion mutants of p22phox were generated by PCR amplification from a full-length human p22phox cDNA as template in the presence of oligonucleotide primers (position and sequence available upon request) and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) used according to the manufacturer's instructions. In addition, to generate constructs with deletions at both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of p22phox, a p22phox cDNA already deleted for base pairs encoding the first 5 amino acids was used as a PCR template to place a premature stop codon. cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen) or, to place a c-Myc-derived epitope tag on the N terminus, into pCMV-Myc (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) (which results in the addition of 14 amino acids corresponding to the Myc epitope and 9 amino acids encoded by polylinker sequence prior to the start of the p22phox sequences). The N-terminal Myc tag was also placed on wild-type p22phox (Myc-p22phox) by subcloning into pCMV-Myc. To prepare p22phox cDNAs with a C-terminal Myc tag, a synthetic oligonucleotide encoding 14 amino acids for the c-Myc epitope was ligated in-frame to the 3′ end of the p22phox cDNAs prior to subcloning into pcDNA3.1/Zeo. The modified p22phox cDNA sequences were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing on both strands. Preparation and manipulation of plasmids were performed using standard protocols (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The nomenclature of the p22phox mutants (Fig. 1) is based on the amino acids that are deleted, and the absence or presence of a Myc tag, as follows. Four N-terminal deletions, p22phox-(1–5), p22phox-(1–11), p22phox-(1–31), and p22phox-(1–61), lack the first 5, 11, 31, or 61 N-terminal residues of p22phox, respectively. p22phox constructs with either an N- or C-terminal c-Myc epitope tag use the same nomenclature, but with inclusion of “Myc” at the beginning or end, respectively (e.g. Myc-p22phox-(1–5), which has an N-terminal Myc tag). Note that for non-Myc-tagged N-terminal deletions, a new in-frame 5′-ATG encoding a methionine is present. Two internal deletions, p22phox-(67–72) and p22phox-(66–90), lack portions of a hydrophilic region spanning amino acids 53–91. Progressive C-terminal deletions were also prepared (p22phox-(172–195), p22phox-(149–195), and p22phox-(131–195)), without or with N-terminal Myc tags, along with several mutants with a C-terminal Myc tag (p22phox-(172–195)-Myc, p22phox-(142–195)-Myc, and p22phox-(132–195)-Myc). Finally, two constructs for p22phox derivatives deleted at both the N- and C terminus (p22phox-(1–5, 172–195) and p22phox-(1–5, 149–195)) were prepared. Cell Lines—CHO K1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) (CRL-1651) and maintained in F12K medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated BGS and 0.15% sodium bicarbonate, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Adherent CHO cells were harvested by incubating with trypsin/EDTA for 3 min at room temperature. Following addition of F12K/10% fetal calf serum to neutralize the trypsin, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), re-pelleted, and rapidly re-suspended in PBS or other buffer as required (36Price M.O.

CHO-K1 cells were stably transfected with one or more plasmids for expression of gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox, as indicated below. Nomenclature for transfected cell lines includes the designation “CHO” followed by the numerical portion of the name of the subunit expressed in the cells (i.e. CHO 91 expresses gp91phox and CHO 91-47-67 expresses gp91phox, p47phox and p67phox).

Clones were selected by limiting dilution in medium containing appropriate antibiotics, as follows, 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), 1.8 mg/ml neomycin, and for 1 mg/ml puromycin. For CHO 91-47-67 and CHOphox lines, CHO cells were transduced with the MFG-S retroviral vector containing the human gp91phox (kindly provided by H. Malech, National Institutes of Health), following packaging using the Pantropic Retroviral Expression System (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Individual clones were screened by immunoblotting for expression of desired phox components. pCMV-Myc and pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmids for transient expression of wild-type p22phox or p22phox deletions were transfected into CHO 91-47-67 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 10 μg of plasmid DNA was used for each 60-mm plate. Cells were analyzed 21 to 42 h after transfection. Transient transfection efficiency was assayed using flow cytometry to monitor expression of GFP in cells transfected in parallel with pIRES2-EGFP (BD Clontech). Transfection efficiency averaged ≈30–40%. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells extracts were prepared for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (31Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. Yu L. Stull N. LeRoy B.A. Bennett S.

Signal from horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-immunoglobulin G was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences or Pierce). The films were scanned using a HP Scan Jet 5300c scanner and the HP Precision Scan Pro software at a resolution of 400 dpi. Densitometry of bands corresponding to gp91phox, p22phox, and β-actin was obtained using the Scion Image 1.63 software (Frederick, MD). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of Flavocytochrome b Subunits—CHO cell lines were grown to ∼70% confluence and then washed before adding 5 ml of methionine-free RPMI containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and incubating for 1 h. [35S]methionine (25 μCi/ml) was then added and the cells labeled for 2 h prior to harvesting, or in the case of pulsechase experiments, supplementing with unlabeled methionine (final concentration 1 mm) and culturing an additional 20 h. Adherent cells were recovered by trypsin treatment, washed in PBS and cell pellets resuspended in 1.5 ml of solubilization buffer (10 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, in 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 1:1,000 dilution of the P8340 protease inhibitor mixture mix). Triton X-100 (final concentration 1%) was added to the cell suspension prior to sonication on ice (5 s × 3, with 1 min rest between each sonication). The cell sonicate was then adjusted to 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.05% SDS and was stirred overnight at 4 °C prior to clarification by centrifugation (55,000 rpm × 30 min at 4 °C in TLA 120.2 rotor, using a Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge). mAbs against gp91phox or p22phox were added to the clarified supernatant, and the samples tumbled at 4 °C for 4 h. To recover immune complexes either protein A (for 44.1) or protein G (for 54.1 and CS9) coupled to Sepharose (30 ml/500 ml sample) was added and samples tumbled at 4 °C for 1 h. Sepharose beads were recovered by centrifugation and the pellets washed five times with 900 ml of ice-cold washing solution (1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.05% SDS in 10 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, in 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA). Immune complexes were released from the Sepharose beads by heating (90 °C ×3 min) in SDS sample buffer without reducing agents. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, adjusted to 10 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 37 °C before separating by SDS-PAGE on a 5–20% SDS gradient gel. Flow Cytometric Analysis of gp91phox Cell Surface Localization—CHO 91-47-67 cells were transiently transfected with either wild type or p22phox mutants as described above. Cells were trypsinized 21–42 h after transfection, collected by centrifugation and washed once with PBS. Following blocking in 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min on ice, cells were stained with the anti-gp91phox 7D5 mAb, without permeabilization. After washing twice with PBS, cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody IgG, and fluorescence measured by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Mouse IgG1 was used as an isotype control. In some experiments, stained cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by FACScan the following morning, with results the same as those obtained using freshly stained, unfixed cells. Measurement of NADPH Oxidase Activity—Following stimulation with 200 μm arachidonic acid, the production of reactive oxidants by the NADPH oxidase was measured in phox-expressing CHO cell lines using isoluminol chemiluminescence (40Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Although oxidant production in these cells is stimulated by either arachidonic acid or phorbol myristate acetate, the former gives a more robust response (Ref. 31Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. Yu L.

https://openalex.org/W1990917011,"The plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger is one of 14 known zinc-binding domains. PHD domains have been found in more than 400 eukaryotic proteins and are characterized by a Cys4-His-Cys3 zinc-binding motif that spans 50-80 residues. The precise function of PHD domains is currently unknown; however, the PHD domains of the ING1 and ING2 tumor suppressors have been shown recently to bind phosphoinositides (PIs). We have recently identified a novel PHD-containing protein, Pf1, as a binding partner for the abundant and ubiquitous transcriptional corepressor mSin3A. Pf1 contains two PHD zinc fingers, PHD1 and PHD2, and functions to bridge mSin3A to the TLE1 corepressor. Here, we show that PHD1, but not PHD2, binds several monophosporylated PIs but most strongly to PI(3)P. Surprisingly, a polybasic region that follows the PHD1 is necessary for PI(3)P binding. Furthermore, this polybasic region binds specifically to PI(3)P when fused to maltose-binding protein, PHD2, or as an isolated peptide, demonstrating that it is sufficient for specific PI binding. By exchanging the polybasic regions between different PHD fingers we show that this region is a strong determinant of PI binding specificity. These findings establish the Pf1 polybasic region as a phosphoinositide-binding module and suggest that the PHD domains function down-stream of phosphoinositide signaling triggered by the interaction between polybasic regions and phosphoinositides.

Complex signaling pathways control cellular growth, differentiation, and proliferation by precisely orchestrating gene expression programs. Not surprisingly, alterations of these programs underlie many pathological conditions. The transfer of signals from the plasma membrane to the cell nucleus is a complex, multistep process that strongly depends, among other components, on lipid signaling molecules. Phosphoinositides (PIs 2The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphoinositide or phosphatidylinositol phosphate; MBP, maltose-binding protein; aa, amino acids; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PHD, plant homeodomain; PBR, polybasic region; GST, glutathione S-transferase. or phosphatidylinositol phosphates) are involved in cell signaling pathways that control broad aspects of cell physiology including proliferation, death, motility, cytoskeletal regulation, intracellular vesicle trafficking, and metabolism (1Irvine R.F.

PIs exert their pleiotropic effects either as precursors of second messengers such as inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol or directly by interacting with signaling effectors. Specific PIs interact with these effectors through highly conserved motifs. Examples include the pleckstrin homology and Phox homology domains, which interact with mono-, bi-, or triphosphorylated PIs; the epsin N-terminal homology domain, which interacts with mono- or biphosphorylated PIs; and the Fab1p/YOTB/Vac1p/EEA1 (FYVE) domain, which interacts with PI(3)P (3Pendaries C. Tronchere H. Racaud-Sultan C. Gaits-Iacovoni F. Coronas S. Manenti S. Gratacap M.P. Plantavid M. Payrastre B. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2005; 45: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Most characterized PI-binding proteins are principally cytoplasmic or membrane bound; however, recent biochemical and imaging studies have detected PIs in the nucleus, suggesting that they also function in this compartment (4Clarke J.H.

Little is known about the function of nuclear PIs; however, recent reports suggest a role in chromatin-dependent changes in gene expression. For example, PI(4,5)P2 stabilizes the association of the SWI/SNF-like BAF chromatin remodeling complex with the nucleosomal template and the nuclear matrix in response to antigen stimulation (7Zhao K. Wang W. Rando O.J. Xue Y. Swiderek K. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ING2 tumor suppressor component of the mSin3A corepressor complex binds PI(5)P. This interaction regulates the association of ING2 with chromatin and induction of p53-dependent apoptosis (8Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). PI(5)P interacts with a C-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) in ING2 providing mechanistic insight into how nuclear PIs modulate cell function. PHD zinc fingers from other proteins also interact with PIs (8Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), demonstrating that this function is not restricted to PHD domains present in the ING family. While one function of PHD zinc fingers seems to be PI binding, current evidence suggests that this is not the sole function of the domain. For example, the domain is highly conserved across phyla and present in more than 400 eukaryotic proteins, suggesting a diversity of functions. Furthermore, mutations in PHD zinc fingers or PHD-containing proteins have been observed in different tumors and a variety of genetic disorders indicating diverse rather than common functions in normal cellular physiology (9Bienz M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 10Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Despite this likely functional diversity, most PHD zinc finger-containing proteins are present in the nucleus as components of large multiprotein transcriptional regulatory complexes that also contain other conserved domains implicated in gene regulation. Together, this collective evidence suggests broad common function for PHD zinc finger-containing proteins in the chromatin-based regulation of gene expression. Recently, we identified a novel protein called Pf1 (PHF12) that contains two conserved PHD zinc fingers (PHD1 and PHD2), as an interacting partner for the mSin3A corepressor (11Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4110-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The mSin3A corepressor complex is abundant, widely expressed, and requires, in part, interactions with histone deacetylases to drive transcriptional repression (12Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 13Ayer D.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Pf1 has two independent binding sites for mSin3A and appears to function as a bridging protein to mediate interactions with another abundant corepressor called TLE1 (11Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4110-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Pf1 also tethers MRG15, which is a member of the MORF family of transcriptional regulators, to mSin3A (14Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7868-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). None of the protein-protein interactions made by Pf1 require its PHD zinc fingers, suggesting that they contribute to other aspects of Pf1 function (11Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4110-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7868-7876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We show here that one PHD zinc finger of Pf1 interacts specifically with monophosphorylated PIs, but surprisingly a polybasic region located just C-terminal of the PHD zinc finger is both necessary and sufficient for specific PI binding. Furthermore, we show that PI binding to a number of previously characterized PHD zinc fingers can be attributed to a polybasic region located at their C termini. Together, our data suggest that the PHD zinc finger and the polybasic region have separable functions that cooperate to regulate gene expression in response to extracellular signals. Plasmids and Protein Expression—ING1, ING2, and ACF1 constructs were provided by Or Gozani. The PHD zinc fingers, with or without the polybasic region (PBR), of Pf1, ING1, ING2, and ACF1 were PCR amplified and cloned in-frame with maltose-binding protein (MBP) in the pMAL-C2 vector (New England Biolabs). To exchange the polybasic regions among the PHD zinc fingers, reverse primers that include the PBR DNA sequence were used in PCR amplifications. The products were then cloned into pMAL-C2 vector. Similarly, to generate the MBP-PBR fusions of Pf1 and ING2, primers encompassing the PBR DNA sequence were designed, annealed, and cloned into the pMAL-C2 vector. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The recombinant protein for each construct was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli using previously published techniques. Briefly, induced cells were lysed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4 7H20) containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and further solubilized in 1% Triton X-100. The solubilized extract was passed over a column containing amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and bound protein eluted with 10 mm maltose. Purified protein was dialyzed overnight against 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% glycerol and protease inhibitors (1.9 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 50 nm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The polybasic region peptide with or without biotin (aminohexanoinc acid-TVR-RKKREQKK) was synthesized at the peptide core facility at the University of Utah. Protein-Lipid Blot Assays—PIP strips and arrays were purchased from Echelon Biosciences. Protein-lipid blot assays were performed as described (8Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane was blocked for 1 h in TBST (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Recombinant protein from 2-5 nm was added to the block solution and the membrane incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following binding, membranes were washed three times in TBST and bound proteins detected using anti-MBP as the primary antibody (1:5000 dilution; New England Biolabs) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody (1:5000; Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Each protein-lipid blot experiment was done at least twice. Previous reports examining PI binding by PHD fingers utilized constructs expressing the PHD finger itself and ∼25 C-terminal residues (8Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). For each PHD finger that bound PIs, the following C-terminal region had a tendency toward positively charged amino acids (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, mutation of six basic residues in the polybasic region that follows the PHD domain of ING2 eliminated ING2 binding to PI(5)P (8Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Together these data suggest that the polybasic region that follows some PHD domains contributes to specific PI binding. PHD1 of Pf1 is followed by a polybasic stretch with 10 of 26 residues being lysine or arginine. By contrast, the 26 residues that follow PHD2 of Pf1 only contain three basic residues (Fig. 1A). These two observations suggest that PHD1, but not PHD2, may bind PIs. We refer to the combination of the PHD domain and the C-terminal 25 amino acids as PHD(C). To determine the lipid binding properties of PHD1(C) and PHD2(C), both were expressed as MBP fusion proteins and tested for binding to a variety of immobilized lipids in an overlay format (Fig. 1B). MBP-PHD1(C) bound monophosphorylated PIs with a preference for PI(3)P. It also bound weakly to PI(3,5)P2. By contrast, no lipid binding was detected for the control MBP or MBP-PHD2(C) fusion protein (Fig. 1C). The binding of MBP-PHD1(C) to different amounts of immobilized PIs revealed that PHD1(C) binds PI (3)P with the highest affinity, followed by PI(4)P, PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P2 (Fig. 1D). The lack of PI binding by PHD2(C) suggests that PHD2 cannot bind PIs or implicates the following polybasic region as a determinant of PI binding. We tried two additional approaches to determine which features of PHD1(C) contributed to PI binding. To disrupt the structure of the PHD domain of PHD1(C), the coordinated zinc molecules were chelated with phenanthroline or a zinc-coordinating cysteine was mutated to arginine. In neither case was binding to mono-phosphorylated PIs disrupted (Fig. 2A and B), suggesting that the structure of the PHD domain itself was not required for PI binding and that binding might be attributed to the following polybasic region. Accordingly, deletion of the polybasic region from PHD1(C) resulted in a complete loss of PI binding (Fig. 2C). We also tested the contribution of the PHD1 polybasic region to PI binding in the context of a fusion protein that contains both PHD1(C) and PHD2(C) separated by their normal spacing. The PHD1(C)-PHD2(C) fusion bound monophosphorylated PIs with the same specificity as PHD1(C) alone, but surprisingly the fusion also bound phosphatidylserine. Like PI binding by PHD1(C), lipid binding by the double PHD domain fusion required the polybasic region C-terminal of PHD1 (Fig. 2D). Together these data demonstrate that the polybasic region C-terminal to PHD1 is necessary for specific lipid binding and further suggests that the PHD domain per se of PHD1(C) may be dispensable for interaction. We next tested whether the polybasic region was sufficient for PI binding. We first replaced the 23 residues that follow the PHD domain of the non-binding PHD2(C) protein with the polybasic residues from the PI binding PHD1(C). We called this construct PHD2(1C). As before, PHD2(C) was unable to bind PIs; however, PHD2(1C) bound monophosphorlyated PIs with identical specificity to PHD1(C) and showed similar weak binding to PI(3,5)P2 (Fig. 3A). Therefore, the polybasic region that follows PHD1 is sufficient for PI binding but does not rule out the possibility that both the PHD finger and the following polybasic region are required for PI binding. To address the PI binding capacity of the PBR in isolation, we fused only the polybasic region from PHD1(C) directly to MBP. This fusion protein, MBP-PBR(Pf1), bound PIs with near identical specificity to PHD1(C), suggesting that the polybasic region was sufficient for PI binding (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the similar binding specificity of the two constructs suggests that the polybasic region is a strong determinant of PI binding specificity. To test the generality of our finding, we made a MBP fusion to the polybasic region that follows the PHD finger of ING2. This protein, MBP-PBR(ING2), bound PIs but showed preferential binding to PI(4)P instead of the broader binding specificity of MBP-PBR(Pf1) (Fig. 3B). Together these findings suggest that the polybasic region is sufficient for PI binding and is a determinant of PI binding specificity. The above data suggest that the polybasic region is sufficient for binding, but it was possible that the PHD finger or MBP have ancillary functions in PI binding; perhaps a folded domain is required for the functional presentation of the polybasic region. We therefore tested a biotinylated polybasic synthetic peptide representing the 11 amino acids immediately C-terminal to the final cysteine of PHD1. This polybasicpeptideboundmonophosphorylated PIs similarly to PHD1(C) and MBP-PBR(Pf1), showing a slight preference for PI(3)P over PI(4)P and PI(5)P. The basic residue-rich tail of histone H2A did not bind immobilized lipids, suggesting that the binding of the PHD1 polybasic region was specific (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, the polybasic region did not bind all lipids, suggesting that interaction is not simply mediated by charge-charge interactions between the positively charged amino acids in the peptide and negatively charged phosphate groups on the lipids. Therefore, the polybasic region that follows PHD1 is sufficient for specific PI binding. To further address the PI binding specificity of the polybasic region, we created a number of chimeric proteins that encoded a PHD finger from one protein followed by the polybasic region from a different protein. In contrast to the previously published report (8Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), MBP-ING2(C) bound most strongly to PI(4)P followed by PI (3)P and only weakly to PI (5)P (Fig. 5A). Consistent with the polybasic region dictating PI binding specificity, a chimera between the PHD1 domain of Pf1 and the polybasic region of ING2, MBP-PHD1(PBR-ING2), bound PIs with similar affinity and identical specificity to MBP-ING2(C) (Fig. 5A). Finally, fusion of the polybasic region of PHD1 to the PHD fingers of ING1, ING2, and ACF1 resulted in proteins that bound PIs with similar, but not identical, specificity. MBP-ING1(PBR-Pf1) bound identically to MBP-PHD1(C), whereas MBP-ING2(PBR-Pf1) also bound PI(3)P and PI(4)P but did not bind PI(5)P or PI(3,5)P2 (Fig. 5B). By contrast, a chimera containing the PHD1 polybasic region and PHD finger of ACF1, MBP-ACF1(PBR-Pf1) had a more relaxed lipid binding specificity. This fusion protein bound to each of the mono and biphosphorylated PIs and also showed weak binding to lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidylehtanolamine, phosphatidic acid, and PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 5B). Together these data suggest that even though the polybasic region is a determinant of lipid binding specificity, the PHD finger also contributes. The PHD zinc finger is a broadly expressed domain conserved across phyla that appears to have a predominant role in transcriptional regulation (9Bienz M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). One reported function of the PHD zinc finger is the binding of PIs, suggesting that PHD-containing proteins are responsive to PI-dependent signaling pathways (8Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G.

Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2005; 45: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We show here that a polybasic region that follows some, but not all, PHD domains is necessary and sufficient for PI binding. Furthermore, PI binding specificity tracked primarily with the polybasic region and was relatively independent of the linked PHD finger (Figs. 3 and 4). As such, we propose that the polybasic regions that follow the PHD1 finger of Pf1 or the single PHD finger of ING2 are the prime determinants of PI binding specificity and PHD domains themselves make relatively minor contributions. Finally, the polybasic regions of PHD1 of Pf1 or ING2 are sufficient for specific PI binding in the complete absence of their cognate PHD finger (Fig. 4), strongly suggesting the PHD finger per se in these proteins plays, at most, only an ancillary role in interactions with PIs. While we have only reexamined the PI binding of the PHD finger of ING2 in detail, a polybasic region follows each of the PHD domains previously shown to interact with PIs (8Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C.

As such, the relative contribution of these PHD domains and their cognate polybasic regions to PI interaction should be reevaluated in the light of our present findings. Several experiments from the previous study examining PI binding by ING2 are consistent with the polybasic region that follows the ING2 PHD domain being necessary for PI interaction. For example, deletion of this polybasic region completely eliminated PI binding as did mutation of 6 lysines or arginines, located in the polybasic region, to alanine (8Gozani O. Karuman P.

In contrast to our findings, these authors did not observe that the polybasic region of ING2 was sufficient for PI binding. This difference may be attributed to the different purification tags used in each experiment. Our studies utilized a MBP tag, whereas a GST tag was used previously; perhaps the GST moiety, which is known to dimerize (16McTigue M.A. Williams D.R. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), makes the short C-terminal polybasic extension unavailable for PI binding. In addition, we observed that ING2 PHD(C) had a preference for PI(4)P rather than the previously observed PI(5)P (Figs. 3 and 5) (8Gozani O. Karuman P. Jones D.R. Ivanov D. Cha J. Lugovskoy A.A. Baird C.L. Zhu H. Field S.J. Lessnick S.L. Villasenor J. Mehrotra B. Chen J. Rao V.R. Brugge J.S. Ferguson C.G. Payrastre B. Myszka D.G. Cantley L.C. Wagner G. Divecha N. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Cell. 2003; 114: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). As we observed the same preference for PI(4)P using our MBP-ING2 as well as the GST-ING2 construct used in the original publication (data not shown), the difference is likely due to differences in the commercial lipid blots used in the two experiments, rather than attributable to differences in the purification tags. Interactions between PIs and a variety of polybasic motifs have precedence in the literature. Most recently, PI(4,5)P2 binding to a polybasic region of N-WASP activates its actin-filament polymerization (17Papayannopoulos V. Co C. Prehoda K.E. Snapper S. Taunton J. Lim W.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Similarly, polybasic motifs found in myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKs) or MARCKs-related protein (MRP) mediate actin-polymerization in response to PI(4,5)P2 (18Wang J. Gambhir A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Murray D. Golebiewska U. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34401-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Interestingly, phosphorylation of key serine residues in the polybasic motif by protein kinase C blocks the effect of PI(4,5)P2 (19Sundaram M. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possibility for proteins such as Pf1 and ING2 that have PHD fingers with PI-binding polybasic regions is to function as mediators of lipid-dependent signaling and transmit extracellular signaling events to multiprotein complexes, ultimately regulating gene expression. The precise mechanistic details of how nuclear PI levels regulate gene expression remain to be determined. Pf1 and ING family proteins (11Yochum G.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4110-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Kuzmichev A. Zhang Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) all interact with mSin3A, yet have different PI binding specificity, thus raising the exciting possibility that the mSin3A-corepressor integrates signals from different PI-dependent signaling pathways. Nuclear levels of most PIs are nearly undetectable; however, multiple experiments suggest nuclear functions for this important class of signaling molecules. For example, while low in quiescent cells, nuclear PIs increase in response to signaling (1Irvine R.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 2Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2005; 96: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PIs and PI kinases are present in distinct subnuclear domains called nuclear speckles; association with these structures is dynamic suggesting interaction is regulated (23Osborne S.L. Thomas C.L. Gschmeissner S. Schiavo G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2501-2511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Finally, subnuclear localization of ING2 appears to be dictated by PI binding (15Gozani O. Field S.J. Ferguson C.G. Ewalt M. Mahlke C. Cantley L.C. Prestwich G.D. Yuan J. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2005; 45: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Based on these findings we have begun to address how PI binding effects the nuclear function of Pf1. Altering interactions between Pf1 and PIs by deleting its polybasic region or lowering PI(3)P levels with MTMR7, a PI(3)P phosphatase (25Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9768-9773Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), had no affect on the known protein-protein interactions and nuclear or subnuclear localization of Pf1. Likewise, Gal4-tethered Pf1, with or without the polybasic region, had no discernable affect on its transcription repression function mediated by the mSin3A-corepressor complex. Furthermore, overexpression of Pf1 or Pf1 lacking the polybasic region affected global gene expression similarly. Therefore, PI binding may affect Pf1 function in ways not assayed here, or perhaps, Pf1 has a unique PI-dependent function distinct from transcriptional repression. Finally, our experiments suggest that the PHD finger motif only plays an ancillary role in PI binding, suggesting that the primary function is still unknown. Given the preponderance of this domain in chromatin modifying complexes, a function in recognizing features of the nucleosomal template seems most likely based on the current evidence. For example, the PHD domains of ACF1 bind to all four core histones (26Eberharter A. Vetter I. Ferreira R. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4029-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, the PHD domain of ING2 and NURF was recently shown to bind the tail of histone H3 that is trimethylated on lysine 4 (27Pena P.V. Davrazou F. Shi X. Walter K.L. Verkhusha V.V. Gozani O.

In preliminary experiments we observe that PHD2, but not PHD1, of Pf1 interacts with histone H3 that is trimethylated on lysine 36 (data not shown). Therefore, some PHD fingers recognize key features of the histone code. In the case of ING2, histone H3 K4-trimethyl binding and PI binding are independent suggesting a possible integration between nuclear PI signaling and the histone code (29Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Pena P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R. Lacoste N. Cayrou C. Davrazou F. Saha A. Cairns B.R. Ayer D.E. Kutateladze T.G. Shi Y. Cote J. Chua K.F. Gozani O. Nature. 2006; 442: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). How broadly these concepts can be applied to other PHD fingers remains to be determined.

Here we demonstrated that overexpression of GRX suppressed the proliferation of myocardiac H9c2 cells treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB. After stimulation with PDGF-BB, the phosphorylation of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) β was suppressed in GRX gene-transfected cells, compared with controls. Conversely, the phosphorylation was enhanced by depletion of GRX by RNA interference. In this study we focused on the role of low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) in the dephosphorylation of PDGFRβ via a redox-dependent mechanism. We found that depletion of LMW-PTP using RNA interference enhanced the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PDGFRβ, indicating that LMW-PTP works for PDGFRβ. The enhancement of the phosphorylation of PDGFRβ was well correlated with inactivation of LMW-PTP by cellular peroxide generated in the cells stimulated with PDGF-BB. In vitro, with hydrogen peroxide treatment, LMW-PTP showed decreased activity with the concomitant formation of dithiothreitol-reducible oligomers. GRX protected LMW-PTP from hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidation and inactivation in concert with glutathione, NADPH, and glutathione disulfide reductase. This strongly suggests that retention of activity of LMW-PTP by enhanced GRX expression suppresses the proliferation of cells treated with PDGF-BB via enhanced dephosphorylation of PDGFRβ. Thus, GRX plays an important role in PDGF-BB-dependent cell proliferation by regulating the redox state of LMW-PTP.

The redox status of sulfhydryl groups in proteins plays an important role in the regulation of cellular functions such as the synthesis and folding of proteins and regulation of the structure and activity of enzymes, receptors, and transcription factors. To maintain the cellular thiol-disulfide redox status under reducing conditions, living cells possess two major systems, the thioredoxin (TRX) 3The abbreviations used are: TRX, thioredoxin; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; GRX, glutaredoxin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LMW-PTP, low molecular weight-protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PTPI, PTP inhibitor; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, PDGF receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; FCS, fetal calf serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SHP, Src homology 2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase; DEP-1, density-enhanced protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1; TC-PTP, T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase. /thioredoxin reductase system and the glutathione (GSH)/glutaredoxin (GRX) system (1Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GRX, also known as thiol transferase, was first discovered as a GSH-dependent hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase in Escherichia coli mutants lacking TRX (2Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). GRX catalyzes the reduction of protein disulfide via a disulfide exchange reaction by utilizing the active site Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys with a dithiol mechanism involving both active-site thiols (3Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In addition, GRX has a unique ability to reduce protein-S-S-glutathione mixed disulfide (deglutathionylation) or to participate in its formation (glutathionylation) through a monothiol mechanism, which requires only the more N-terminal active site Cys (3Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 4Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Oxidized GRX is selectively recycled to the reduced form by GSH with the formation of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and regeneration of GSH through coupling with NADPH and GSSG reductase, a system termed the GSH-regenerating system (5Holmgren A.

These characteristic interactions with GSH distinguish GRX from TRX, which favors intramolecular disulfide substrates and is turned over by NADPH and thioredoxin reductase independent of GSH. Functional overlap or cross-talk between the two systems, however, has been indicated (7Prinz W.A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol.

The other form of GRX, GRX2, is distributed in the mitochondria and nucleus and also functions as part of a cellular antioxidant defense system by regulating the redox status of mitochondrial proteins such as complex I protein (21Johansson C.

PDGF is a family of homo- and heterodimers of disulfide-bonded polypeptide chains A, B, C, and D (i.e. PDGF-AA, BB, CC, DD, and AB) (24Tallquist M. Kazlauskas A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). PDGFs bind to two cell-surface receptor-tyrosine kinases, PDGF receptor (PDGFR) α and β. The PDGF molecules are bivalent, and PDGF-dependent activation of receptors causes a mitogenic signal transduction through the phosphorylation of specific tyrosines in the receptors. The in vivo function of PDGF signaling has been studied with gene targeting experiments (25Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 26Betsholtz C. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). PDGF-BB or PDGFRβ knock-out mice die during late gestation from cardiovascular complications (27Leveen P. Pekny M. Gebre-Medhin S. Swolin B. Larsson E. Betsholtz C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1857-1887Crossref Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 28Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ signaling in the myocardiac development of mice. Although the physiological functions of PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ signaling in myocardiac cells are not fully understood, PDGFRβ is expressed in adult rat heart (29Sarzani R. Arnaldi G. Chobanian A.V. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 888-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rat cardiomyocyte-derived H9c2 cells (30Brostrom M.A. Meiners S. Brostrom C.O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 736-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ signaling also controls the proliferation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (31Liu J. Wu L.-L. Li L. Zhang L. Song Z-E. Regul. Pept. 2005; 127: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that the PDGF-BB/PDGFRβ signaling pathway plays an important role in the cellular physiology of myocardiac cells, although the precise regulatory mechanism for the signaling pathway and its relation to cellular redox-dependent regulation are not yet clarified. In the present study we explored the effect of overexpression of GRX on PDGF-BB-dependent signaling and cell proliferation in myocardiac H9c2 cells. We found that overexpression of GRX suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRβ after stimulation with PDGF-BB, resulting in a suppression of the PDGF-BB-dependent cell proliferation. Furthermore, we describe a novel regulatory mechanism for PDGF-BB signaling involving the redox-dependent regulation of low molecular weight protein-tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) by GRX in a GSH-dependent manner. Antibodies and Reagents—Rabbit anti-mouse GRX polyclonal antibody was prepared as described before (20Murata H. Ihara Y. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Sumikawa K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50226-50233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against PDGFRβ and phospho-(Tyr-751)-PDGFRβ were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibody and protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor III (PTPI-III; α-bromo-4-(carboxymethoxy)-acetophenone) were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Sheep anti-LMW-PTP polyclonal antibody for immunoprecipitation was from Exalpha Biologicals (Watertown, MA). Rabbit anti-Myc tag polyclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads were obtained from BD Biosciences Clontech. 125I-Labeled PDGF-BB (25 μCi/ml) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. 4-Acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) was purchased from Molecular Probes. PDGF-BB, GSH, GSSG, NADPH, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody were from Sigma. GSSG reductase was from Roche Applied Science. H2O2, CdCl2, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Cell Line and Culture—H9c2 cells, a clonal line derived from embryonic rat heart, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1446). H9c2 cells which had been transfected with the expression vector for mouse GRX1 cDNA have been described previously (20Murata H. Ihara Y. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Sumikawa K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50226-50233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cell lines (GRX22 and -30) expressing high levels of FLAG-tagged GRX protein were used in the study. H9c2 cells and gene-transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) containing 75 μg/ml G418 and 75 μg/ml hygromycin B in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell Proliferation—The proliferation of cultured cells was evaluated by measuring attached live cells photometrically after staining with crystal violet. The cells (5000) were placed in 100 μl of medium/well in 96-well plates and cultured in medium containing 0.5% FCS with or without 0.5 nm PDGF-BB for specific periods. Then the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5), washed, and stained with 0.01% crystal violet at room temperature for 20 min. Each well was extensively washed with water and dried. The stained cells were lysed by adding 100 μl of lysis buffer A (10% SDS and 0.1 n HCl), and the cell number was then estimated photometrically by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a microplate reader. Immunoblot Analysis—Cultured cells were harvested and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40, including protease inhibitors (20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm pepstatin, and 50 μm leupeptin)). The protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Protein samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7.5–15%) under reducing conditions as described previously (32Kageyama K. Ihara Y. Goto S. Urata Y. Toda G. Yano K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19255-19264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The proteins in the gels were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and then reacted with primary antibodies in TBST containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin or 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk overnight with constant agitation at 4 °C. After several washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Proteins in the membranes were then visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation—Cultured cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer B. Cell lysates normalized for protein levels were immunoprecipitated using anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with cold lysis buffer B. For the immunoblot analysis, the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer containing DTT and boiled for 3 min. Then the supernatant was directly subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells using the standard protocol and was reverse-transcribed using a One Step RNA PCR kit (avian myoblastosis virus (AMV)) (TaKaRa Biomedicals, Japan) with AMV-derived reverse transcriptase XL according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was run for 25 cycles of 95 °C for 0.5 min at 65 °C and for 0.5 min at 72 °C for 1.5 min. Primer sequences were as follows: for rat LMW-PTP (33Cirri P. Caselli A. Manao G. Camici G. Polidori R.

Construction of LMW-PTP Gene Expression Vector—Fulllength human LMW-PTP cDNA was cloned from total RNA of human colon cancer HCT8 cells by reverse transcription-PCR using Super Script II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Advantage HF2 Taq polymerase (BD Biosciences Clontech) with the following primer pair, which was designed on the basis of reported nucleotide sequences for human LMW-PTP (34Wo Y.Y. McCormack A.L. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Davis J.P. Mitchell G.L. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol.

The amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into a TA cloning vector (pCRII, Invitrogen), and the nucleotide sequences were confirmed by sequencing with an ALFexpress II system (Amersham Biosciences). The LMW-PTP cDNA was cloned into a C-terminal Myc-tagged expression vector, pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen) under the control of the CMV promoter for expression in mammalian cells and also was cloned into a bacterial expression vector, pGEX6p-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The gene transfection into mammalian cells was performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA Interference and Transfections—Double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) corresponding to rat GRX DNA sequences (GenBank™ accession number NM_022278) (5′-ACU GCA AGA UUC AGU CUG GdTdT-3′ (siRNA-GRX-1) and 5′-AAC GUG GUC UCC UGG AAU UdTdT-3′ (siRNA-GRX-2)) and to rat LMW-PTP DNA sequences (GenBank™ accession number NM_021262) (5′-CAC AUU GCA CGG CAG AUU AdTdT-3′ (siRNA-LMW-PTP-1) and 5′-UGA GAG AUC UGA AUA GAA AdTdT-3′ (siRNA-LMW-PTP-2)) were synthesized and annealed by Samchully Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, Korea. siRNAs were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a final siRNA concentration of 100 nm. LMW-PTP Activity Assay—The activity of LMW-PTP was measured according to the methods of Chiarugi et al. (35Chiarugi P. Fiaschi T. Taddei M.L. Talini D. Giannoni E. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33478-33487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, the LMW-PTP expression vector was transfected into control and GRX gene-transfected H9c2 cells. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were lysed, and the cell lysates normalized for protein levels were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. In each experimental condition, duplicate immunoprecipitates were prepared and subjected to the PTP activity assay or to immunoblot analysis for estimation of the level of LMW-PTP obtained in each immunoprecipitation. After washing, the beads were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, then the reaction was stopped by the addition of 6 n NaOH. Aliquots of the mixture were used to determine the phosphatase activity spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm. Each activity was standardized by comparing with the level of LMW-PTP in the immunoprecipitates densitometrically estimated in immunoblot analysis and expressed as the relative value to the activity for the untreated control (% of untreated control). Furthermore, LMW-PTP activity in vitro was also measured for recombinant LMW-PTP after incubation with or without H2O2. The aliquots were diluted 20-fold by adding 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 1 mm EDTA and subjected to the PTP activity assay as described above. Activity was quantified by comparison with a standard curve (0.01–0.2 mm p-nitrophenol). Purification of Recombinant LMW-PTP and Generation of Antibody against LMW-PTP—LMW-PTP was purified with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, E. coli strain BL21 cells were transformed with pGEX6p-LMW-PTP, and protein expression was induced by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. GST-fused LMW-PTP (GST-LMW-PTP) was affinity-purified from cell lysates using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and then digested with PreScission protease. The cleaved GST was removed from glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and LMW-PTP was purified. The LMW-PTP was used to immunize rabbits to generate anti-LMW-PTP antibodies and also used for in vitro experiments concerning redox regulation of LMW-PTP as described below. Determination of the Redox State of LMW-PTP in Vitro—The redox state of LMW-PTP was assessed by modifying free thiol with AMS (20Murata H. Ihara Y. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Sumikawa K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50226-50233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant LMW-PTP (2 μg) was reduced by incubation with 50 mm DTT for 30 min on ice. DTT was then removed by gel filtration on NAP-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Reduced LMW-PTP was incubated at room temperature for the periods indicated with H2O2 in buffer with or without the GRX (4–40 μg) and/or GSH-regenerating system as described (20Murata H. Ihara Y. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Sumikawa K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50226-50233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The GSH-regenerating system was composed of GSH/GSSG (1 mm GSH and 0.05 mm GSSG), NADPH (1 mm), and GSSG reductase (GR) (1.2 units). After incubation, LMW-PTP protein was incubated with buffer containing a final concentration of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% SDS, and 15 mm AMS at 4 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE with or without DTT and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins in the membrane were then visualized by immunoblot analysis as described above. Peroxide Quantification—Peroxide was quantified using the PeroXOquant quantitative peroxide assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells were incubated with PDGF-BB for given periods. Cells were then harvested and lysed on ice in 100 μl of distilled water by sonication using an ultrasonic applicator (Bioruptor UCD-200T, COSMO BIO, Tokyo, Japan). Working reagent (100 μl) was mixed with 10 μl of lysate and incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min. The purple product composed of Fe3+-xylenol orange complex was detected spectrophotometrically at 570 nm in the reaction mixture. Activity was quantified by comparison with a standard curve (1–50 μm H2O2). The protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test or analysis of variance (StatView software). Significance was set at p < 0.05. Overexpression of the GRX Gene Inhibits PDGF-induced Proliferation of H9c2 Cells—Rat myocardiac H9c2 cells were transfected with mouse GRX1 gene expression vectors to obtain two cell lines overexpressing GRX. Fig. 1A shows that expression of GRX increased in the overexpressors (GRX22 and GRX30) and was immunologically undetectable in mock-transfected (control) H9c2 cells. Recently it has been reported that an antioxidant inhibited cell growth by blocking the phosphorylation of tyrosines in PDGFRβ elicited by PDGF-BB (36Chen A. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23381-23389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In H9c2 cells PDGF-BB induces cell proliferation through PDGFRβ (30Brostrom M.A. Meiners S. Brostrom C.O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 736-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We also examined the PDGF-BB-dependent proliferation of H9c2 cells in culture medium containing 0.5% FCS with different concentrations of PDGF-BB (0–0.5 nm) and found that the cells proliferated with PDGF-BB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, inset). The result showed that 0.5 nm PDGF-BB could sufficiently stimulate the proliferation of H9c2 cells and was consistent with a previous report by Brostrom et al. (30Brostrom M.A. Meiners S. Brostrom C.O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 736-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional role of overexpressed GRX in myocardiac cell proliferation, control and GRX gene-transfected cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS with or without 0.5 nm PDGF-BB, then cell proliferation was analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” In Fig. 1B, after 3 days of culture with 0.5 nm PDGF-BB, the cell count had doubled in control cells, but the increase was suppressed among the transfectants. On the other hand, without PDGF-BB, proliferation was apparently suppressed in all cells. To investigate whether PDGF-BB signaling is influenced by overexpression of GRX, the phosphorylation status of PDGFRβ was examined immunologically in the cells treated with 0.5 nm PDGF-BB (Fig. 1C). In control cells phosphorylation of PDGFRβ was markedly increased by PDGF-BB, but the increase was apparently suppressed in GRX gene-transfected cells treated with PDGF-BB. Together, these results indicate that PDGF-dependent cell proliferation was suppressed by overexpression of GRX in H9c2 cells through the suppressed phosphorylation of a specific receptor, PDGFRβ. Using 125I-labeled PDGF-BB, the binding of PDGF-BB both to control and GRX gene-transfected cells was investigated as described in the supplemental material. The results showed that overexpression of GRX did not influence the PDGF-BB binding to the cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Furthermore, we examined cell surface expression of PDGFRβ in control and GRX gene-transfected cells after biotinylation of cell surface proteins and found that overexpression of GRX did not change the expression level of cell surface PDGFRβ (supplemental Fig. S1C). Together, these results indicate that overexpression of GRX does not influence the ligand-receptor binding mechanism of PDGF-BB in H9c2 cells. LMW-PTP Regulates Phosphorylation of PDGFRβ—For the dephosphorylation of PDGFR, there are various PTPs reported, which include Src homology 2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1 and SHP-2, density-enhanced proteintyrosine phosphatase-1 (DEP-1), PTP-1B, PTP-PEST, T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP), and LMW-PTP (37Chiarugi P.

Among them, we focused on LMW-PTP because its redox-dependent regulation was extensively studied in the case of PDGF-BB signaling (39Raugei G. Ramponi G. Chiarugi P. Cell. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2148496191,"Members of the chloride channels, calcium-activated (CLCA) family of proteins and in particular the murine mCLCA3 (alias gob-5) and its human ortholog hCLCA1 have been identified as clinically relevant molecules in diseases with secretory dysfunctions including asthma and cystic fibrosis. Initial studies have indicated that these proteins evoke a calcium-activated chloride conductance when transfected into human embryonic kidney cells 293 cells. However, it is not yet clear whether the CLCA proteins form chloride channels per se or function as mediators of other, yet unknown chloride channels. Here, we present a systematic biochemical analysis of the posttranslational processing and intracellular trafficking of the mCLCA3 protein. Pulse-chase experiments after metabolic protein labeling of mCLCA3-transfected COS-1 or human embryonic kidney 293 cells revealed cleavage of a primary 110-kDa mCLCA3 translation product in the endoplasmic reticulum into a 75-kDa amino-terminal and a 35-kDa carboxyl-terminal protein that were glycosylated and remained physically associated with each other. Confocal fluorescent analyses identified both cleavage products in vesicles of the secretory pathway. Neither cleavage product was associated with the cell membrane at any time. Instead, both subunits were fully secreted into the extracellular environment as a soluble complex of two glycoproteins. These results suggest that the two mCLCA3 cleavage products cannot form an anion channel on their own but may instead act as extracellular signaling molecules. Furthermore, our results point toward significant structural differences between mCLCA3 and its human ortholog, hCLCA1, which is thought to be a single, non-integral membrane protein.

This primary protein is thought to become glycosylated to form an ∼130-kDa glycoprotein that is then cleaved into an ∼90-kDa and an ∼40-kDa subunit. The two subunits were hypothesized to form a transmembrane protein with four or five membrane spanning domains, possibly shaping a pore through the membrane, consistent with the proposed function as a channel (2Gruber A.D.

Musante L. Cinti R. Seri M. Moran O. Zegarra-Moran O. Galletta L.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An alternative model with only a single transmembrane domain was established for hCLCA1 using the SMART program (22Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 23Loewen M.E. Forsyth G.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1061-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Sequence homologies with the extracellular α2-integrin collagen receptor domain in the central region of the hCLCA1 protein suggested a single transmembrane domain only close to the carboxyl terminus. In sharp contrast to all these models are recent studies which have proposed that the larger amino-terminal cleavage products of hCLCA1 and mCLCA3 may be membrane-associated proteins without any transmembrane domain (24Gibson A. Lewis A.P. Affleck K. Aitken A.J. Meldrum E. Thompson N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27205-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Other CLCA family members that comprise only the aminoterminal third of the CLCA consensus sequence were shown to encode soluble, fully secreted proteins, namely a variant (clone 4Gruber A.D.

Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a secreted nature was also observed for mCLCA3 in immunolocalization studies using native murine tissues; immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated the protein in mucin granules of intestinal goblet cells and in the extracellular mucous layer but no association with the cell membrane (11Leverkoehne I. Gruber A.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In summary, previous results led to contradictory hypotheses on the transmembrane topology of CLCA proteins, even for the same protein.Here, we present a systematic biochemical analysis of the posttranslational processing and intracellular trafficking of the mCLCA3 protein. The results clearly show that the primary mannose-rich glycosylated 110-kDa mCLCA3 translation product is cleaved into a 75-kDa amino-terminal and a 35-kDa carboxyl-terminal protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. No association with the plasma membrane was observed using biochemical and immunofluorescent assays. Instead, both subunits were fully secreted as a complex glycosylated protein complex into the extracellular environment. The subunits remained associated with each other inside and outside the cell. Our results are at variance with a previously reported model for its human ortholog, hCLCA1, as a single, non-integral membrane protein (24Gibson A. Lewis A.P. Affleck K. Aitken A.J. Meldrum E. Thompson N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27205-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) but support the notion that mCLCA3 cannot form an anion channel on its own but may instead act as a soluble signaling molecule.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESComputer-aided Analyses—The mCLCA3 amino acid sequence (GenBank™ accession number NP_059502) was screened for a signal sequence using the SignalP 3.0 software (25Bendtsen J.D.

The software NetNGly was used to identify potential N-linked glycosylation sites.Materials—Reagents used for PCR were purchased from Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany, and nucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Tissue culture dishes were obtained from Greiner, Hamburg, Germany. Streptomycin, penicillin, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), methionine-free DMEM, and trypsin were purchased from PAA, Pasching, Austria. Fetal calf serum, pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, trypsin inhibitor, and molecular mass standards for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Sigma. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and antipain were obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Lipofectamine was purchased from Invitrogen. l-[35S]Methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Acrylamide and tetramethylethylenediamine were purchased from Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany. SDS, ammonium persulfate, dithiothreitol and Tri-ton X-100 (TX-100) were obtained from Merck.

The pEYFP-N1, galactosyltransferase (GT)-DsReD, and pDsRed2-ER vectors were purchased from Clontech Laboratories Inc., Heidelberg, Germany. Restriction enzymes and prestained SDS marker were obtained from MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany. For immunoprecipitation and Western blot of YFP-tagged mCLCA3 protein, the BD living colors™ full-length Aequorea victoria polyclonal antibody or monoclonal antibody (JL-8) (anti-YFP; BD Biosciences) was used. For immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of untagged mCLCA3 protein and for immunofluorescence microscopy, the rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-p3b was used. Western blot analyses of YFP-tagged mCLCA3 protein were carried out using the rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-p3a and p3bs used which were generated against synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to amino acids 83 to 97 (p3a) or 253 to 267 (p3b) of the mCLCA3 protein (11Leverkoehne I. Gruber A.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked IgG antibody (anti-rabbit HRP; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) or anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Biologo, Kronshagen, Germany) were used as secondary antibody for Western blot analyses. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to visualize the protein labeling in the Western blot analyses (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-AlexaFluor 568 or IgG-AlexaFluor 433 (anti-rabbit Fluor; Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibody for immunofluorescence analyses.Construction of a YFP-tagged mCLCA3 Protein—The previously cloned mCLCA3 open reading frame (11Leverkoehne I. Gruber A.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was transferred without the stop codon into the pEYFP-N1 vector. For insertion into the vector, oligonucleotide primers flanking the mCLCA3 open reading frame and containing appropriate linkers were designed for PCR (upstream primer, 5′-ATCTCGAGCTATGGAATCTTTGAAGAGTCCTG-3′, with the XhoI restriction site underlined; downstream primer 5′-ATAAGCTTGTGCAAACCTAGTGTCACCTGC-3′ with the HindIII restriction site underlined). PCR was performed using Pwo DNA polymerase and the following conditions: 35 cycles of 95 °C for 2 min, 65 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 2 min with a time increment of 8 s per cycle for each extension step (72 °C) followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified product was cut with XhoI and HindIII and subsequently cloned into the respective XhoI/HindIII sites of the pEYFP-N1 vector upstream of the YFP open reading frame. Complete sequencing excluded PCR and reading frame errors (Gen-Bank™ accession number AB 016592) and verified correct carboxyl-terminal linkage to the YFP open reading frame.Transient Transfection of COS-1 Cells and HEK 293 Cells—Cells were kept in 10-cm culture dishes with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (culture medium) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Between medium changes cells were washed with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) unless mentioned otherwise. For confocal fluorescence and all biochemical analyses, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the mCLCA3-YFP vector or the mCLCA3 vector (11Leverkoehne I. Gruber A.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using DEAE-dextran as described previously (34Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of plasmid-DNA were incubated with 10 μl of DEAE-dextran (50 mg/ml) in 1.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, cells at 40% confluency were incubated for 90 min with the DNA-DEAE complex. The complex was then replaced for 3 h with culture medium containing chloroquine (5 mg/ml) followed by incubation in unsupplemented culture medium. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the same vectors using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's protocol to confirm and reproduce the data in a second cell line. Mock transfection was performed with the vector alone.Biosynthetic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—48 h after transfection COS-1 cells were biosynthetically labeled. After preincubation with 5 ml of methionine-free minimum Eagle's medium for 2 h, the medium was replaced by a similar medium containing 100 μCi of [35S]methionine. Labeling was performed for 6 h. In pulse-chase experiments the cells were pulsed with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine for 20 min followed by a chase with nonradioactive methionine for different time intervals. Cells and medium were analyzed separately. The medium was removed and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was kept on ice until immunoprecipitation. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. The lysis buffer contained 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% Triton X-100 and was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 50 μg/ml trypsin. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 10,000 × g to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation. After a preclearing step of medium and cell lysates with protein A-Sepharose beads, immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-YFP or anti-p3b antibodies. In a fashion similar to Jacob et al. (35Jacob R. Weiner J.R. Stadge S. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10650-10657Google Scholar), medium and cell lysates were incubated separately for 2 h at 4 °C with the respective antibody first (1:5000) and then with protein A-Sepharose beads (100 or 20 μl, respectively). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% slab gels, and the radioactive proteins were visualized using a Phosphor-Imager (Bio-Rad).Western Blot Analysis—48 h after transfection, COS-1 and HEK 293 cells and medium were processed as described above. Immunoprecipitates were boiled in 3-fold SDS-PAGE Laemmli buffer, split in two, and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Native protein lysates from murine colon mucosa (20 μg/lane (11Leverkoehne I. Gruber A.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)) served as positive controls. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 90 min at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk and subsequently probed for 1 h at room temperature with anti-YFP (1:1,000) or anti-p3b (1:750) or anti-p3a (1:100) diluted in blocking buffer. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:2,000) or anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:200) diluted in Tris-buffered saline-Tween. Protein labeling was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence.Endoglycosidase Treatment—Digestion of the immunoprecipitates of mCLCA3 protein or mCLCA3-YFP tagged with endo H or PNGase F before SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting was performed as described previously (36Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal images of living cells were generated 48 h after transfection using a Leica TCS SP2 microscope equipped with a ×65 water planapo-chromat lens and an argon laser (Leica Microsystems, Solms, Germany). Dual color YFP and dsRed images were obtained by sequential scans with the 514-nm excitation line of an argon laser or the 543-nm excitation line of a He/Ne laser, respectively.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-1 cells transfected with mCLCA3 and YFP tagged mCLCA3 were grown for 48 h on coverslips. The attached cells were fixed with 4% paraform-aldehyde for 4 h, washed twice with PBS, and quenched twice for 10 min with 50 mm NH4Cl. After blocking in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.5% saponin (blocking buffer) for 30 min, the samples were incubated with anti-p3b (1:250) in blocking buffer for 45 min at room temperature. After 4 washes in blocking buffer, cells were incubated with secondary fluorochrome-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000; AlexaFluor 568 or 433) in blocking buffer for 45 min. After repeated washes in blocking buffer and in PBS at room temperature, the coverslips were fixed on a glass slide with moviol. Dual color images were generated by excitation of the YFP protein and the AlexaFluor dye at 514 or 568 nm, respectively. The AlexaFluor antibody 433 was excited at 433 nm.RESULTSComputer-aided Hydrophobicity Plots and Glycosylation Site Prediction of the mCLCA3 Primary PolypeptideTo date, prediction of CLCA transmembrane domains has mainly been based on Kyte-Doolittle analyses, leading consistently to CLCA protein conformation models with a single hydrophobic, amino-terminal, cleavable signal sequence, and four or five potential transmembrane domains (2Gruber A.D.

In the present study analyses of the mCLCA3 protein using the transmembrane prediction programs Kyte-Doolittle (Fig. 1A), SOSUI, HMMtop, TMPRED, DAS, and PSORT II all confirmed the existence of a hydrophobic amino-terminal sequence consistent with a cleavable signal sequence. However, analyses of the mCLCA3 amino acid sequence using Kyte-Doolittle, SOSUI, HMMtop, DAS, and PSORT II did not predict any transmembrane domain. In contrast, TMPRED software suggested two potential transmembrane domains at amino acids 375-396 and 464-484 (Fig. 1B) but no carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain as was predicted for mCLCA1 using this software (7Romio L.

https://openalex.org/W1988332714,"We have previously shown that glycosphingolipid analogs are internalized primarily via caveolae in various cell types. This selective internalization was not dependent on particular carbohydrate headgroups or sphingosine chain length. Here, we examine the role of sphingosine structure in the endocytosis of BODIPY™-tagged lactosylceramide (LacCer) analogs via caveolae. We found that whereas the LacCer analog with the natural (d-erythro) sphingosine stereochemistry is internalized mainly via caveolae, the non-natural (l-threo) LacCer analog is taken up via clathrin-, RhoA-, and Cdc42-dependent mechanisms and largely excluded from uptake via caveolae. Unlike the d-erythro-LacCer analog, the l-threo analog did not cluster in membrane microdomains when added at higher concentrations (5–20 μm). In vitro studies using small unilamellar vesicles and giant unilamellar vesicles demonstrated that l-threo-LacCer did not undergo a concentration-dependent excimer shift in fluorescence emission such as that seen with BODIPY™-sphingolipids with natural stereochemistry. Molecular modeling studies suggest that in d-erythro-LacCer, the disaccharide moiety extends above and in the same plane as the sphingosine hydrocarbon chain, while in l-threo-LacCer the carbohydrate group is nearly perpendicular to the hydrocarbon chain. Together, these results suggest that the altered stereochemistry of the sphingosine group in l-threo-LacCer results in a perturbed structure, which is unable to pack closely with natural membrane lipids, leading to a reduced inclusion in plasma membrane microdomains and decreased uptake by caveolar endocytosis. These findings demonstrate the importance of the sphingolipid stereochemistry in the formation of membrane microdomains.

In the same study, we also varied the chain length of the sphingosine backbone (C12, C16, C18, or C20), the chain length of the BODIPY™-fatty acid, and the nature of the fluorophore used for synthesis of the LacCer analogs, but in each case the GSLs were internalized almost exclusively via caveolae. In the present study, we show that changing the sphingosine stereochemistry from the d to the l configuration inhibits LacCer uptake by caveolae and induces internalization by other endocytic mechanisms. In addition, evidence is presented showing that organization of the natural stereoisomer into PM microdomains is a prerequisite for its internalization through caveolae. Cell Culture—Normal HSFs (GM-5659) were obtained from Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ) and grown as described (18Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed using monolayer cultures grown to ∼35–50% confluence on acid-etched glass coverslips. Lipids, Fluorescent Probes, and Miscellaneous Reagents—The non-natural d-t, l-e, and l-t stereoisomers of BODIPY™-LacCer, and the natural isomer, BODIPY™-d-e-LacCer, were synthesized and purified as described (18Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Liu Y. Bittman R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 142: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). (2S)-3-Deoxy-BODIPY™-LacCer was synthesized as follows. After 1-pentadecyne was converted to (2R)-octadec-4-yne-1,2-diol (20Bittman R. Kasireddy C.R. Mattjus P. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), azidation with trimethylsilyl azide afforded (2S,4Z)-2-azidooctadec-4-en-1-ol (21He L. Wanunuy M. Byun H.-S. Bittman R. J. Org. Chem. 1999; 64: 6049-6055Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which was used as the lactosyl acceptor. Reaction with hepta-O-acetyl-β-lactosyl-1-trichloro-acetimidate (22Amvam-Zollo P.H. Sinay P. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 150: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) in methylene chloride in the presence of molecular sieves and a catalytic amount of boron trifluoride etherate, followed by hydrolysis of the acetate groups with sodium methoxide in methanol, provided (2S)-2-azido-3-deoxy-LacCer. Reduction of the azide with triphenylphosphine in aqueous tetrahydrofuran and in situ N-acylation with the N-hydroxysuccinimidoyl ester of 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoic acid (19Liu Y. Bittman R. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 142: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) furnished the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel followed by preparative thin-layer chromatography. The d-e and l-t isomers of BODIPY™-sphingomyelin (SM) were separated by thin-layer chromatography (23Koval M. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2169-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) using a commercial sample of BODIPY™-SM (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen; Eugene, OR) as the starting material. Each sphingo-lipid analog was complexed to defatted bovine serum albumin for incubation with cells (18Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Alexa Fluor (AF) 594 or 647 labeled-transferrin (Tfn), AF594-dextran, and AF647-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Anti-β1-integrin (IgG1) antibodies were from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-β1-integrin Fab fragments were generated from this IgG1 using the ImmunoPure IgG1 Fab preparation kit from Pierce and were labeled with AF647 succinimidyl ester using a protein labeling kit from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were from Sigma. Protein Constructs and Co-transfections—Plasmids encoding wild type or DN AP180 (H. McMahon, Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology), RhoA or Cdc42 (D. Billadeau, Mayo Foundation), or the IL-2R β chain (IL-2R β) (A. Dautry-Varsat, Institut Pasteur, Paris) were generous gifts as noted. For studies of protein overexpression, cells were co-transfected with the protein construct of interest and pDsRed2-Nuc (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The pDsRed2-Nuc construct labeled the nucleus with red fluorescence and served as a reporter for the transfected cells. Cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) and 3 μg/ml of DNA as described (8Singh R.D. Puri V. Valiyaveettil J.T. Marks D.L. Bittman R. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3254-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed 24–48 h after transfection. Incubation with Inhibitors—Cells were preincubated in HEPES-buffered MEM (HMEM) containing PP2 (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA) (10 nm), genistein (50 μm), or Clostridium difficile toxin B (100 μm) for 1 h at 37°C, or with nystatin (25 μg/ml) or chlorpromazine (8 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Inhibitors were present in all subsequent steps of the experiment. Cells were then washed with ice-cold HMEM and incubated for 30 min at 10 °C with 2.5 μm BODIPY™-LacCer/bovine serum albumin to label the PM, washed twice with HMEM, and further incubated for 3 min at 37 °C, followed by back exchange with 5% defatted bovine serum albumin (6 times, 10 min each at 10 °C) to remove fluorescent lipid remaining at the PM after endocytosis (18Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Samples were maintained at 10 °C and viewed under the fluorescence microscope (see below). Incubation with Various Markers—Cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml AF594 Tfn for 30 min at 10 °C, further incubated for 3 min at 37 °C, and acid-stripped (8Singh R.D. Puri V. Valiyaveettil J.T. Marks D.L. Bittman R. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3254-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) to remove labeled protein remaining at the cell surface. For fluid phase uptake, cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml AF594-dextran for 5 min at 37 °C without preincubation or acid stripping. For IL-2R internalization studies, cells transiently transfected with IL-2R β were incubated with 1 nm IL-2 and 5 μg/ml phycoerythrin-mik-β3 (the IL-2R β chain antibody) for 5 min at 37 °C as described (17Cheng Z.J. Singh R.D. Sharma D.K. Holicky E.L. Hanada K. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3197-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Microdomain Studies—HSFs were washed with ice-cold HMEM and transferred to 10 °C. Cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of BODIPY™-LacCer isomer for 30 min at 10 °C to label the PM. Samples were then washed, and images were acquired simultaneously at green and red wavelengths (see below). For specimens labeled with BODIPY™-lipid and AF647-Tfn or -Fab, images were acquired at three wavelengths (green, red, and far red) and subsequently rendered in pseudo color with green and red corresponding to LacCer and blue for the Tfn or Fab markers. All images were acquired on a cooled microscope stage maintained at 10 °C. Fluorescence Microscopy and Analysis—Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope as described (7Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C.

The microscope was equipped with a Dual-View module (Optical Insights; Tucson AZ) for simultaneous acquisition of green and red images. In experiments using double- or triple-labeled specimens, control samples were labeled identically with the individual fluorophores and exposed identically to the dual- or triple-labeled samples at each wavelength to verify that there was no crossover among emission channels. Digital images were quantified by image processing using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) as described (24Sharma D.K. Choudhury A. Singh R.D. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E.

J. 1997; 72: 37-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Lipid Vesicle Experiments—Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were formed from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and various amounts of BODIPY™-d-e- or l-t-LacCer (refer to Fig. 5) as described (26Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Fluorescence scans of SUVs were performed using a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ). Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) were prepared and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy as described (27Ishitsuka R. Yamaji-Hasegawa A. Makino A. Hirabayashi Y. Kobayashi T. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 296-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. One ml of a chloroform solution containing 360 nmol of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 20 nmol of dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol, 20 nmol of dilauroylphosphatidylglycerol, and 40 nmol of BODIPY™-d-e or l-t-LacCer in a glass test tube was dried with a rotary evaporator to form a thin lipid film. The tubes were placed in vacuo for >2h. After the completely dried lipid films were prehydrated with water-saturated nitrogen for 20 min at 50 °C, 1.6 ml of 5 mm PIPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mm EDTA was added gently to the test tubes. The tubes were incubated at 55 °C overnight and then the samples were slowly cooled to room temperature. Harvested GUVs were placed on a coverslip and were enclosed on a slide glass within a ring of silicone high vacuum grease. The specimens were allowed to settle for 10 min. Fluorescence images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.2 water-corrected objective. Green fluorescence was observed by using a 488-nm argon laser for the excitation and a 505–530-nm filter for the emission. Red fluorescence was measured using the same excitation and a 560-nm cutoff filter for the emission. Molecular Modeling Studies—Models of BODIPY™-LacCer stereoisomers were constructed and steric energy was minimized using the Chem3D program (Ultra 9.0, CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge, MA) with MM2 force field for removing van der Waals repulsions (28Allinger N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 8127-8134Crossref Scopus (4127) Google Scholar). This served to create the initial structures for calculating the ground-state equilibrium geometry by ab initio restricted Hartree-Fock methods (29Hehre W. A Guide to Molecular Mechanics and Quantum Chemical Calculations. Wavefunction, Irvine, CA2003: 343-356Google Scholar) using the Spartan molecular modeling program for Windows (Spartan'04; Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, CA) on a desktop computer. Calculations were performed with the 3–21G* basis set (30Pietro W. Francl M. Hehre W. DeFrees D. Pople J. Binkley J. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 1982; 3: 556-560Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) excluding solvent molecules for faster convergence. Endocytosis Mechanism for the d- and l-Isomers of BODIPY™-LacCer Are Distinct—Our previous studies demonstrated that fluorescent analogs of LacCer and other GSLs are selectively internalized via caveolae in multiple cell types (7Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 8Singh R.D. Puri V. Valiyaveettil J.T.

Parton R.G. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3114-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These analogs all contained the natural, d-erythro (d-e) ceramide moiety. However, the ceramide moiety of all mammalian GSLs has two asymmetric carbon atoms and therefore four possible stereoisomers. In the present study, we synthesized all four stereoisomers of BODIPY™-LacCer (Fig. 1) and characterized their endocytosis in HSFs. The effect of various pharmacological inhibitors and DN AP180 on the internalization (3 min at 37 °C) of the different stereoisomers of BODIPY™-LacCer is shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Internalization of the d-threo (d-t) isomer was similar to that of the d-e isomer in that both were sensitive to treatments that inhibit caveolar uptake (nystatin, mβ-CD, genistein, or PP2) but were insensitive to inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (chlorpromazine or DN AP180) (8Singh R.D.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8233-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, the internalization of the l-erythro (l-e) and l-threo (l-t) isomers of BODIPY™-LacCer were also similar to each other but different from that seen using the d-isomers. Both of the l-isomers were inhibited ∼70% by chlorpromazine or in cells expressing DN AP180, while little or no effect was seen using the other inhibitors. Additional studies were carried out using Clostridium dificile toxin B (toxin B) (a broad range Rho GTPase inhibitor that inhibits fluid phase endocytosis and phagocytosis (33Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Sabharanjak S. Sharma P. Parton R.G. Mayor S. Dev.

These treatments had little effect on the internalization of the BODIPY™-d-LacCer isomers but inhibited uptake of the l-e and l-t analogs by about 30–40% (Fig. 2, C and D).FIGURE 2d- and l-stereoisomers of BODIPY™-LacCer are internalized by distinct endocytic mechanisms in HSFs. A, effect of pharmacological inhibitors and DN AP180 on uptake of BODIPY™-LacCer.

Bars, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since both d-isomers behaved similarly to each other, and both l-isomers behaved similarly to each other, we restricted our further studies to the d-e and the l-t analogs of BODIPY™-LacCer. The contrast between the internalization mechanisms utilized by these analogs is further illustrated in Fig. 3. First we examined the effect of DN Rab5a on internalization of the two isomers. Rab5a promotes the homotypic fusion of very early endosomes to generate the early endosome compartment. As previously shown (24Sharma D.K. Choudhury A. Singh R.D. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7564-7572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), expression of DN Rab5a had no effect on the initial internalization of the d-e-isomer of the LacCer analog; however, uptake of the l-t analog was inhibited by about 60% (Fig. 3, A and B). We also carried out co-localization studies in which cells were double labeled with BODIPY™-d-e-or-l-t-LacCer and either fluorescent Tfn or dextran (Fig. 3, C–E). In the case of the d-e analog and Tfn, there was only about 10–15% overlap of the two markers at an early time point (30 s), increasing to about 40% at 3 min. This increase presumably reflects the merging of markers internalized by caveolae and the clathrin pathway at early endosomes (24Sharma D.K. Choudhury A. Singh R.D. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7564-7572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast, there was 65–75% overlap of the l-t analog with Tfn at all time points examined (0.5–3 min) (Fig. 3D). When similar experiments were carried out using the BODIPY™-LacCer analogs and fluorescent dextran, little overlap was seen at any time point using the d-e isomer, while ∼35% co-localization was seen between l-t-LacCer and fluorescent dextran at all times points examined between 0.5 and 3 min (Fig. 3E). Together, the results in Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate that the d-e and d-t isomers were internalized by a similar mechanism. Based on our previous studies showing that the d-e analog is internalized via caveolae, we conclude that this mechanism also holds for d-t-LacCer. In contrast, the l-e and l-t isomers were internalized primarily by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, with smaller amounts of internalization taking place by RhoA-dependent and Cdc42-dependent mechanisms. However, our data suggest that a small amount of the l-isomers was also internalized via caveolae (e.g. see Fig. 2A). Organization of BODIPY™-LacCer into PM Domains and Mapping of Endocytic Cargo—We next compared the distribution of BODIPY™-d-e-versus l-t-LacCer at the PM of treated cells. HSFs were incubated with various concentrations of each of these lipids for 30 min at 10 °C, and then images were acquired while maintaining the cells at 10 °C to inhibit endocytosis. To distinguish PM microdomains enriched in LacCer from other regions of the same membrane containing lower concentrations of lipid, we simultaneously monitored both monomer (green) and excimer (red) fluorescence emission (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 4A). When low concentrations of BODIPY™-d-e-LacCer were used, little heterogeneity in the distribution of the labeled lipid was seen and the PM emitted green fluorescence. When higher concentrations (≥2.5 μm) of the d-e analog were used, micron size “patches” of yellow/orange fluorescence were seen on a background of green fluorescence at the PM. In contrast, when cells were treated identically, but using BODIPY™-l-t-LacCer, only green fluorescence was detected regardless of the concentration used. However, using this analog, we did detect small green patches of fluorescence distributed over the cell surface regardless of the concentration of fluorescent lipid that was used. The absence of excimer fluorescence at the PM of BODIPY™-l-t-LacCer-treated cells was not due to decreased incorporation of the l-t analog relative to that observed with the d-e analog since extraction of the treated cells and quantitative lipid analysis demonstrated that the uptake was approximately the same for both isomers (1744 ± 345 versus 1726 ± pmol/mg cell protein for the d-e versus l-t isomers, respectively). We next co-incubated cells with BODIPY™-d-e- or -l-t-LacCer and various fluorescently labeled endocytic markers to map the distribution of these markers on the PM relative to the LacCer microdomains (Fig. 4B). β1-Integrin labeled with a Fab fragment overlapped extensively with BODIPY™-d-e-LacCer red patches, similar to findings in our previous stud"
https://openalex.org/W2053501105,"Osmotic stress activates MAPKs, including JNK and p38, which play important roles in cellular stress responses. Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a member of the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family and can activate JNK and p38. TAK1 can also activate IκB kinase (IKK) that leads to degradation of IκB and subsequent NF-κB activation. We found that TAK1 is essential for osmotic stress-induced activation of JNK but is not an exclusive mediator of p38 activation. Furthermore, we found that although TAK1 was highly activated upon osmotic stress, it could not induce degradation of IκB or activation of NF-κB. These results suggest that TAK1 activity is somehow modulated to function specifically in osmotic stress signaling, leading to the activation of JNK but not of IKK. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this modulation, we screened for potential TAK1-binding proteins. We found that TAO2 (thousand-and-one amino acid kinase 2) associates with TAK1 and can inhibit TAK1-mediated activation of NF-κB but not of JNK. We observed that TAO2 can interfere with the interaction between TAK1 and IKK and thus may regulate TAK1 function. TAK1 is activated by many distinct stimuli, including cytokines and stresses, and regulation by TAO2 may be important to activate specific intracellular signaling pathways that are unique to osmotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2084318043,"Control of cell cycle progression/exit and differentiation of neuronal precursors is of paramount importance during brain development. BM88 is a neuronal protein associated with terminal neuron-generating divisions in vivo and is implicated in mechanisms underlying neuronal differentiation. Here we have used mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2a cells as an in vitro model of neuronal differentiation to dissect the functional properties of BM88 by implementing gain- and loss-of-function approaches. We demonstrate that stably transfected cells overexpressing BM88 acquire a neuronal phenotype in the absence of external stimuli, as judged by enhanced expression of neuronal markers and neurite outgrowth-inducing signaling molecules. In addition, cell cycle measurements involving cell growth assays, BrdUrd incorporation, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that the BM88-transfected cells have a prolonged G1 phase, most probably corresponding to cell cycle exit at the G0 restriction point, as compared with controls. BM88 overexpression also results in increased levels of the cell cycle regulatory protein p53, and accumulation of the hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma protein leading to cell cycle arrest, with concomitant decreased levels and, in many cells, cytoplasmic localization of cyclin D1. Conversely, BM88 gene silencing using RNA interference experiments resulted in acceleration of cell proliferation accompanied by impairment of retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of Neuro 2a cells. Taken together, our results suggest that BM88 plays an essential role in regulating cell cycle exit and differentiation of Neuro 2a cells toward a neuronal phenotype and further support its involvement in the proliferation/differentiation transition of neural stem/progenitor cells during embryonic development.

The formation of the nervous system is governed by a delicate balance between cell proliferation, subsequent cell cycle withdrawal, and differentiation to distinctive neuronal phenotypes (1Cremisi F. Philpott A. Ohnuma S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Ohnuma S. Harris W.A.

Current observations have highlighted the existence of mechanisms coupling cell cycle exit and differentiation as well as functional cross-talk between intrinsic factors controlling these two mechanisms. A number of key factors regulating cell cycle progression have been implicated in cell fate determination and differentiation of neuronal precursors, whereas specification- and/or differentiation-inducing molecules are beginning to emerge as cell cycle regulators (3Dou C.L.

However, there are still important questions regarding the timing control of the proliferation/differentiation switch that remain unanswered. In the central nervous system, control of cell cycle progression plays an essential role in the generation of the appropriate number of neurons and the formation of functional neuronal circuits. When a neuronal progenitor is committed to undergo differentiation, it exits from the G1 phase of the cell cycle and enters into an irreversible quiescent state referred to as G0.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). p53, when activated, causes G1 arrest at the G0 restriction point by inducing expression of p21 and consequent inhibition of D-type cyclins and related cyclin-dependent kinases (8Cheng M.

Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, hypophosphorylated pRb associates with the E2F family of transcription factors, thus impairing their ability to transactivate genes required for cell cycle progression (11Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 457-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As a consequence cells do not progress through the G1-to-S phase transition. Several studies have indicated that a critical event associated with cell cycle withdrawal and differentiation both in neuronal and non-neuronal cells is the cellular compartmentalization of cyclin D1, which shifts from a predominantly nuclear localization to cytoplasmic sequestration (12Sumrejkanchanakij P. Tamamori-Adachi M. Matsunaga Y. Eto K. Ikeda M.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8723-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 13Sumrejkanchanakij P. Eto K. Ikeda M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Withdrawal from the cell cycle is accompanied by acquisition and maintenance of the neuronal phenotype, which involves a large number of genes that are expressed in a predetermined and coordinated manner (14Matsas R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 429: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 15Schuurmans C. Guillemot F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These include proneural genes, transcription factors involved in patterning, and members of the basic helix-loop-helix protein family (16Chae J.H. Stein G.H. Lee J.E. Mol.

Favor J. Saunders G.F. Stoykova A. Gotz M. Development (Lond.). 2004; 131: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Several studies indicate that distinct neuronal fates are determined during the final cell cycle of neural progenitors, and therefore determination of the involvement of genes that act during this stage is of particular importance (1Cremisi F. Philpott A. Ohnuma S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Ohnuma S. Philpott A. Harris W.A. Curr. Opin.

BM88 (Cend1 for cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation 1, according to NCBI nomenclature at www.ncbi.nih.gov) has been initially identified as a protein expressed in mature neurons (22Patsavoudi E. Hurel C. Matsas R. Neuroscience. 1989; 30: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Patsavoudi E. Hurel C. Matsas R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, subsequent studies revealed that BM88 marks neuronal cells all along the different stages of the neuronal lineage; it is expressed at low levels in neuronal precursors, and its expression is distinctly up-regulated in young post-mitotic as well as in mature neurons (24Koutmani Y. Hurel C. Patsavoudi E. Hack M. Gotz M. Thomaidou D. Matsas R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 2509-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Patsavoudi E. Merkouri E. Thomaidou D. Sandillon F. Alonso G. Matsas R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus there is an interesting correlation between BM88 expression and the progression of progenitor cells toward neuronal differentiation in the developing embryonic brain, suggesting that BM88 may be functionally involved in this process. This is further supported by the fact that BM88 is associated in vivo with asymmetric neuron-generating cell divisions (24Koutmani Y. Hurel C. Patsavoudi E. Hack M. Gotz M. Thomaidou D. Matsas R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 2509-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), while it also enhances the morphological differentiation of mouse neuroblastoma cells in vitro (26Mamalaki A.

BM88 cloned from mammalian brain (26Mamalaki A. Boutou E. Hurel C. Patsavoudi E. Tzartos S. Matsas R. J. Biol.

J. 2001; 355: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) is an integral membrane protein composed of two 22-23-kDa polypeptide chains linked together by disulfide bridges. It is anchored to the membrane of intracellular organelles, including the outer membrane of mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum, and other electrolucent vesicles, via a transmembrane domain so that the bulk of the protein faces toward the cytoplasm (25Patsavoudi E. Merkouri E. Thomaidou D. Sandillon F. Alonso G. Matsas R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Mamalaki A. Boutou E. Hurel C. Patsavoudi E. Tzartos S. Matsas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14201-14208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Of interest, the human BM88 gene is localized in chromosome 11p15.5, a region associated with overgrowth genetic disorders and several types of cancers, whereas the mouse gene is mapped at the corresponding region of the syntenic chromosome 7 (27Gaitanou M. Buanne P. Pappa C. Georgopoulou N. Mamalaki A. Tirone F. Matsas R. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The recently characterized human BM88 promoter confers specific transcriptional activity in primary neurons and is activated by the transcription factor Sp1 (28Papadodima O. Sergaki M. Hurel C. Mamalaki A. Matsas R. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 146-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Notably, transcriptional deregulation of Sp1-dependent pathways in neurons is supposed to be at the basis of neurodegenerative disorders (29Zhai W. Jeong H. Cui L. Krainc D. Tjian R. Cell. 2005; 123: 1241-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 30Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In this study we have sought to analyze the functional properties of BM88 using the mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2a (N2A) cell line as an in vitro model for neuronal differentiation. We demonstrate by gain- and loss-of-function approaches that BM88 is sufficient and necessary for accomplishment of cell cycle exit and differentiation of N2A cells toward a neuronal phenotype, and we provide direct evidence that BM88 activates the p53-pRb signaling pathway that controls the balance between cell proliferation and cell cycle exit. Moreover, we demonstrate that the anti-proliferative effect of BM88 is associated with cyclin D1 down-regulation and, in many cells, with cytoplasmic cyclin D1 localization, concomitantly to pRb hypophosphorylation and subsequent withdrawal from the cell cycle at the G1/G0 transition point. Our data suggest that BM88 up-regulation upon precursor to neuron switch is functionally relevant and may form part of the underlying mechanisms operating during neurogenesis in vivo. N2A Stable Transfection—For transfections, the full-length porcine BM88 cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) at HindIII and XbaI sites. N2A cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and were allowed to reach 50% confluence. Transfections were performed for 5 h with 2 μg of plasmid pcDNA3 containing BM88 and Lipofectamine Reagent diluted in Opti-MEM medium in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The transfection medium was then removed, and cells were fed with complete growth medium for 48 h. Stable transfectants were selected with 1 mg/ml geneticin maintained in the growth medium for 5 weeks. For cell cloning, the cells were aliquoted into 96-well tissue culture plates in different dilutions, and stable transfectants were selected. Numerous stable cell lines expressing BM88 were isolated as determined by immunofluorescence screening using specific mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal anti-BM88 antibodies (22Patsavoudi E. Hurel C. Matsas R. Neuroscience. 1989; 30: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Patsavoudi E. Merkouri E. Thomaidou D. Sandillon F. Alonso G. Matsas R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) followed by an appropriate fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Two independent clones, C3C1 and C7G5, with the highest BM88 expression, were selected for further studies and were found to behave similarly in all tests performed. As controls, we used either the parental nontransfected N2A cells or cells transfected with the pcNeo vector alone (26Mamalaki A. Boutou E. Hurel C. Patsavoudi E. Tzartos S. Matsas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14201-14208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with no apparent differences between them. Transient Transfections and Reporter Assays—N2A and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. One day prior to transfections, cells were plated into 6-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 1.3 × 105 cells/well, and DNA was introduced by liposome-mediated transfection using 2 μg of DNA, 5 μl of Lipofectamine, and 2 μl of Plus reagent in a final volume of 1 ml of Opti-MEM (all reagents from Invitrogen). For double transfections, 2-4 μg of the coding region of the porcine BM88 cDNA (26Mamalaki A. Boutou E. Hurel C. Patsavoudi E. Tzartos S. Matsas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14201-14208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or 2 μg of cyclin D1 cDNA (pRc-CMV-cycD1 construct) or PC3/Tis21 cDNA (pSCT-PC3) were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of the human pRb cDNA cloned into the pCMVneoBam vector (pCMV-pRB1 construct), and all, except the BM88 cDNA, were obtained from Dr. F. Tirone, Institute of Neurobiology and Molecular Medicine, Rome, Italy (31Guardavaccaro D. Corrente G. Covone F. Micheli L. D'Agnano I. Starace G. Caruso M. Tirone F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1797-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Transfection mixtures were replaced by serum-containing medium 5 h post-transfection, and cells were collected 48 h later and processed for Western blot analysis. For luciferase assays, 2 μg of the pWWP-luc reporter construct (provided by Dr. D. Kardassis, University of Crete Medical School, Hellas) were co-transfected with 0.2 μgofa β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pCMVβ (Clontech) (28Papadodima O. Sergaki M. Hurel C. Mamalaki A. Matsas R. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 146-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies, luciferase activity was normalized according to β-galactosidase values. All experiments were performed in duplicate at least three times, and statistical analysis was performed by the paired two-sample Student's t test. Adenoviral Infections—Construction of the recombinant BM88 adenovirus was performed using the Adeno-Quest system (Quantum Biotechnologies), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the coding region of the porcine BM88 cDNA was inserted into the pQBI-AdCMV5-IRES-GFP adenoviral vector, and recombinant adenoviral particles were produced by co-transfection of the vector and the helper virus and homologous recombination into the HEK-293A human cell line. Selection and further purification of the BM88 positive viruses were performed using the plaque assay method. The adenoviral supernatants were then used to infect N2A cells overnight. Infected cells were in turn transiently transfected with the human pRb cDNA cloned into the pCMVneoBam vector as described above. Genotoxic Stress Assay—The chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (adriamycin, Sigma), known to induce genotoxic stress (32Legac G. Esteve P.O. Ferec C. Pradhan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24161-24170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Wu G.S. El-Deiry W.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 623-633PubMed Google Scholar), was added to NIH 3T3, wild type N2A, and N2A-BM88 subconfluent cells at a final concentration of 1.5 μm for a total period of 36 h, and cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence staining. Immunofluorescence Staining—For localization staining experiments, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in 48-well plates and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C with the mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, or Golgi markers: Mito Tracker Red CMXRos dye, DiOC6(3), or BODIPY TR ceramide (all from Molecular Probes). Live-stained cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-BM88 monoclonal antibody followed by a 2-h incubation with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (22Patsavoudi E. Hurel C. Matsas R. Neuroscience. 1989; 30: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Patsavoudi E. Merkouri E. Thomaidou D. Sandillon F. Alonso G. Matsas R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Other primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence single or double labeling experiments (24Koutmani Y. Hurel C. Patsavoudi E. Hack M. Gotz M. Thomaidou D. Matsas R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 2509-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) include the following: mouse monoclonal anti-synaptophysin (34Gaitanou M. Mamalaki A. Merkouri E. Matsas R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); mouse monoclonal anti-βIII-tubulin (Tuj1 antibody from Covance); mouse monoclonal SMI 311 (Stenberger Monoclonals, Denmark), which recognizes nonphosphorylated epitopes of high molecular weight neurofilament protein; rabbit polyclonal anti-fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGF-R, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal anti-NCAM (kind gift of Dr. G. Rougon, Institut de Biologie du Developpement, Marseille, France); mouse monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (D01, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse monoclonal anti-p21 antibody (187, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and rabbit polyclonal anti-Bax antibody (N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In situ apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (35Thomaidou D. Mione M.C. Cavanagh J.F. Parnavelas J.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cell survival was estimated by trypan blue exclusion. Quantification of the p53 immunofluorescence signal was performed in a total number of 100 cells/different condition using the Alpha Image software (Alpha Innotech Co.), as described previously (36Sidera K. Samiotaki M. Yfanti E. Panayotou G. Patsavoudi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45379-45388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the average fold increase of fluorescence signal relatively to N2A untreated cells was estimated. Cell Cycle Measurements—DNA synthesis assays using 5′-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) were performed either by a single 4-h BrdUrd pulse (100 μm) in cells that had been maintained in culture for 2 days, followed by fixation, or by adding to cells immediately after plating repetitive doses of 100 μm BrdUrd at 2-h intervals for the duration of 18 h (cumulative labeling). BrdUrd incorporation was detected using an anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (DAKO) as described previously (24Koutmani Y. Hurel C. Patsavoudi E. Hack M. Gotz M. Thomaidou D. Matsas R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 2509-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in duplicate at least three times, and statistical analysis was performed by the paired two-sample Student's t test. Image analysis was carried out using a Leica-TCS-NT/SP confocal microscope. Western Blot Analysis—Exponentially growing cells were washed twice in cold PBS and lysed in PBS containing 0.2% SDS, 1% Triton, 1% sodium fluoride, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were incubated for 15 min in ice, vortexed vigorously every 5 min, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Proteins were precipitated by 4 volumes of acetone at -80 °C overnight, centrifuged for 30 min, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and blotted onto Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-BM88 monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000); anti-synaptophysin monoclonal antibody (Gaitanou et al. (34Gaitanou M. Mamalaki A. Merkouri E. Matsas R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); 1:1000); affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to cyclin E (1:200), cyclin B1 (1:200), cyclin D1 (1:100), and p53 (DO-1; 1:100) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Detection of pRb was performed with the G3-245 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes both the hyper- and hypophosphorylated forms of the protein (Pharmingen; diluted to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml), following protein electrophoresis in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to separate the two forms of pRb. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences, and blots were developed using either the diaminobenzidine (Sigma) chromogenic system or ECL (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. FACS Analysis—N2A and N2A-BM88 cells cultured on 10-cm plates for 4 days were incubated for 10 min in PBS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, harvested, and centrifuged for 2 min at 1200 rpm. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, 1 mm EDTA, and cells were fixed by dropwise addition of ice-cold 70% ethanol while vortexing and left overnight at -20 °C. Cells were centrifuged, washed in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, resuspended in 100 μl of RNase A (100 μg/ml in PBS), and incubated for 10 min at room temperature followed by staining with 700 μl of propidium iodide (50 μg/ml in PBS) for 5 min. A total of 10,000 stained cells were analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS BD Biosciences). The Modfit software (BD Biosciences) was used to determine the distribution of cells in the various cell cycle phases designated G0/G1, S, and G2/M. BM88 Knockdown in N2A Cells Using siRNA—Two different siRNAs for BM88 (siBM88) were purchased from Dharmacon (Boulder, CO). The sequences of BM88-specific siRNAs are available upon request; the nontargeting control siRNA was also purchased from Dharmacon (catalog number D-001210-01-05). NIH 3T3 and N2A cell lines were transfected 24 h after plating with 100 nm siRNAs. Proliferation was estimated 72 h after transfection by BrdUrd incorporation after a single 3-h BrdUrd pulse. Cells were visualized using a Zeiss fluorescence photomicroscope equipped with a Leica DC300 digital camera and image analysis system (ImageJ software from National Institutes of Health). For quantification of proliferation, 1000 DAPI-positive cells were scored for BrdUrd staining from five independent experiments in each case (siCTR or siBM88 transfections). Retinoic acid (RA, 10 μm)-induced differentiation of N2A cells (26Mamalaki A. Boutou E. Hurel C. Patsavoudi E. Tzartos S. Matsas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14201-14208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was initiated 24 h after siRNA transfection and was estimated 48 h later by measuring the length of 1) process outgrowth under phase-contrast optics and 2) βIII-tubulin positive processes. In both cases, 1000 cells were measured from five independent experiments, and statistical analysis was performed by the paired two-sample Student's t test. Quantitative RT-PCR—DNase I-treated total RNA from cells transfected with siCTR or siBM88 (100 nm) (Lipofectamine) was purified 72 h after transfection using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Quantitative RT-PCR assays were done in triplicate using the LightCycler RNA amplification kit (Roche Applied Science) on a LightCycler instrument in conjunction with gene-specific unlabeled external forward and reverse primers and pairs of differentially labeled forward internal primers (HybProbes FL and LC, emitting at 530 and 640 nm, respectively; designed and produced by TIB MOLBIOL, Syntheselabor GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (mGAPDH), which was used as an internal standard, and BM88 mRNA (mBM88) were as follows: mGAPDH forward, 5′-AACTCCCTCAAGATTGTCAGCAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATGTCAGATCCACAACGGATACA-3′; mBM88 forward, 5′-CGAGAAGCTGGAGGGCCCAAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCCCACGCTAGTGCTTC-3′. Primers for murine (m) FGF-R1, p53 (Trp-53) and cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) were as follows: mFGF-R1 forward, 5′-GGCGGGTAACTCTATCGGAC-3′, and mFGF-R1 reverse, 5′-TTATAGATGATGACAGAGCCCAACAT-3′; Trp-53 forward, 5′-GTGCACGTACTCTCCTCCC-3′, and Trp-53 reverse, 5′-ATTTCCTTCCACCCGGATA-3′; cyclin D1 forward, 5′-GCCCTCCGTATCTTACTTCAA-3′, and cyclin D1 reverse, 5′-CATTTGCAGCAGCTCCTCG. The hybridization probe pairs used were as follows: mGAPDH LC, 5′-ACTGTGGTCATGAGCCCTTCCACG-3′, and FL, 5′-CAGTCTTCTGAGTGGCAGTGATGGCA-3′; mBM88 LC, 5′-GTCACACAAGCCCCAAACCAGCT-3′, and FL, 5′-ACACTGTGGTCTAGCCACCTGCC-3′; mFGF-R1 LC, 5′-GGTCTCTCTTCCAGGGCTTCCAGAACG-3′, and FL, 5′-GGTAGAGCGGTGAGGTCATCACAGC-3′; Trp53 LC, 5′-TGACGGAGGTCGTGAGACGCT-3′, and FL, 5′-GGCCATCTACAAGAAGTCACAGCAC-3′; Ccnd1 LC, 5′-CCTCACAGACCTCCAGCATCCAGG-3′ and FL, 5′-GAAGACCTCCTCTTCGCACTTCTGC-3′. Quantification standard curves were obtained using PCR products diluted in 10 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Normalization of the mBM88 expression was done against mGAPDH.

https://openalex.org/W2052019729,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory mediator with the ability to induce various immunomodulatory responses and override glucocorticoid-driven immunosuppression. Some of these functions have been linked to the unusual enzymatic properties of the protein, namely tautomerase and oxidoreductase activities. However, there are conflicting reports regarding the functional role of these enzymatic properties in normal physiological homeostasis and disease progression. Therefore, we have produced a highly pure, virtually endotoxin-free recombinant MIF preparation and fully characterized this using a variety of biochemical and biophysical approaches. The recombinant protein, with demonstrable enzymatic activity, was then used to systematically examine the biological activity of MIF. Surprisingly, treatment with MIF alone failed to induce cytokine expression, with the exception of IL-8. However, co-treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in conjunction with MIF produced synergistic secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-8 compared with LPS alone. The potentiating effect of MIF was seen at physiologically relevant concentrations. These data suggest that MIF has no conventional cytokine activity but, rather, acts to modulate and amplify the response to LPS.

Significant interest in MIF as a pro-inflammatory mediator involved in human disease was based on the following important findings: (i) raised MIF concentrations in peripheral blood and specific tissue specimens in a broad range of diseases, including inflammatory conditions, various tumors, and metabolic disorders such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and obesity (2Lan H.Y.

MIF has no homology with any other pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the mechanism(s) by which MIF exerts its biological effects remain unclear. Attempts to identify a cell surface MIF transmembrane receptor, which would explain some of the reported MIF regulatory effects in relation to extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-1/2 (11Mitchell R.A.

Metz C.N. Fang Y. Xu J. Donnelly S. Baugh J. Delohery T. Chen Y. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), although there is no compelling evidence of any potential link between this antigen-processing molecule and intracellular signaling pathways. The absence of a validated signal transduction mechanism via a transmembrane receptor suggests that MIF may mediate its effects mainly by non-receptor mediated endocytosis (16Kleemann R. Grell M. Mischke R. Zimmermann G. Bernhagen J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast to all other known cytokines, MIF has several unusual intrinsic enzymatic activities, specifically l-dopachrome tautomerase, phenylpyruvate tautomerase (17Rosengren E. Bucala R. Aman P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsmann H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thiol-protein oxidoreductase (18Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R.

MIF utilizes an N-terminal proline as a catalytic base in tautomerization reactions. A physiologically relevant substrate for MIF tautomerase activity has yet to be identified. Studies using N-terminal mutants of MIF lacking tautomerase activity have produced controversial findings and have not demonstrated direct correlation of tautomerase enzymatic activity with any biological functions (19Bendrat K.

A series of small molecule compounds with very potent inhibitory properties (IC50 < 1 μm) toward the tautomerase activity of MIF have been identified, but their ability to inhibit the cytokine-like properties of MIF remains unclear (23Orita M. Yamamoto S. Katayama N. Fujita S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 1297-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MIF can exhibit redox activity via its CALC motif that also binds to Jab-1 (24Kleemann R. Rorsman H. Rosengren E. Mischke R. Mai N.T. Bernhagen J. Eur. J.

A 16-residue peptide fragment of MIF spanning the CALC region exhibits redox activity and MIF-like glucocorticoid-overriding activity in vitro (27Nguyen M.T. Beck J. Lue H. Funfzig H. Kleemann R.

Nevertheless, the relationship between these catalytic sites and the reported cytokine activities of MIF remains unresolved. Cellular studies of cytokine activities using bacterially expressed recombinant MIF have produced conflicting results.

It should be noted that in these reports the protein was identified as glycosylation inhibitory factor, although this has an identical amino acid sequence to human MIF. The critical reagent required to address the differences in cellular effects found in previous experiments is enzymatically active and endotoxin-free recombinant MIF. Notably, there have been significant variations in the levels of LPS contamination reported in bacterially expressed preparations of MIF (28Calandra T. Bernhagen J. Metz C.N. Spiegel L.A. Bacher M.

Despite these discrepancies, MIF has been classified as a cytokine in its own right, and the possible contribution of LPS in purified recombinant MIF preparations as a co-stimulus of immune response in various in vitro and in vivo models has not been considered. We describe here modifications to the previously reported purification schemes for MIF that have facilitated the availability of a virtually endotoxin-free protein preparation and simultaneously prevented potentially deleterious denaturation of the protein. The purified protein was thoroughly characterized using enzymatic assays and biophysical approaches. Next, we investigated the different biological activities attributed to MIF and tried to address conflicting literature reports regarding its immunological effects. Plasmid—Human full-length MIF cDNA (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank Accession number Z23063) coding amino acids 1–115 was amplified by PCR from human Marathon-Ready liver cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the following oligonucleotide primers: wtMIF-Forward, 5′-TTTTTCATATGCCGATGTTCATCGTAAACAC-3′, and wtMIF-Reverse, 5′-TTTTTGGATCCTTAGGCGAAGGTGGAGTTGTTCCAGC-3′ and AccuPrime Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI, and ligated into the bacterial expression vector pET11b (Novagen, Nottingham, UK) to produce pET11b-MIF. The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3-MIF was generated by transfer of the same PCR product to the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The IL-6-luciferase reporter plasmid (p1168hu.IL6-luc), obtained from Dr. G. Haegeman, has been previously described (39Berghe W.V. Plaisance S. Boone E. Bosscher K.M. Schmitz M.L. Fiers W. Haegeman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The hygromycin resistance plasmid (pTK-Hyg Vector) was obtained from Clontech. The IL-2-luciferase reporter plasmid (pIL-2-luc) was generated by fusing the minimal human IL-2 promoter (residues –326 to +45 relative to the transcriptional start site) containing 5 AP-1 binding sites (GAGTCA) upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the expression vector pCLN15ΔCX. The pMMTV-luc plasmid has been previously described (40Doppler W. Windegger M. Soratroi C. Tomasi J. Lechner J. Rusconi S. Cato A.C. Almlof T. Liden J. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A. Richard-Foy H. Starr D.B. Klocker H. Edwards D. Geymayer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells—Rat 1 fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC and cultured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). THP-1 cells were routinely cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 mm glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated FBS. To induce differentiation to a more macrophage phenotype, THP-1 cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of 100 ng/ml vitamin D3 (Calbiochem) and 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma). Before assays with recombinant MIF and/or LPS, THP-1 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in 6-well format, grown for 72 h, and washed with complete RPMI 1640 medium without vitamin D3 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Human PBMC were isolated from freshly drawn whole heparinized blood. Blood was diluted 2-fold with sterile PBS and centrifuged in Accuspin tubes (BD Biosciences) over lymphocyte separation medium (ICN Flow). For assay work, isolated intermediate phase human PBMC cells were aspirated, washed 3 times in PBS, and plated at 5 × 106 cells/ml in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mm glutamine and 5% FBS. Human monocytes were purified from PBMC by magnetic separation of cells onto anti-CD14 coated MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Eluted CD14+ monocytes were plated at 2 × 105 cells/ml and differentiated into macrophages in presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R&D Systems) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml for 72 h. Human granulocytes were isolated using discontinuous Ficoll gradient and erythrocyte lysis in isotonic buffer. Isolated granulocytes were counted, resuspended in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, and used immediately. Human synovial fibroblasts were isolated from knee biopsy samples obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis as previously described (21Onodera S. Kaneda K. Mizue Y. Koyama Y. Fujinaga M. Nishihira J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 444-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and used at passage 5 or 6. The study was conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki principles. The purity of the cells was >95% fibroblast-like cells, as confirmed by microscopy. The purity of the cells was >95% fibroblast-like cells, as confirmed by microscopy. Synovial fibroblasts were plated for experiments at 1 × 106 cells/ml cultured in the presence of complete DMEM medium with nonessential amino acids, 1 mm glutamine, 10% FBS. A549 cells were grown in HEPES-buffered DMEM with phenol red containing 10% (v/v) charcoal/dextran stripped FBS (Hyclone). Expression and Purification of MIF—Large scale expression and purification of recombinant human MIF was performed as previously described (35Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) but with some modifications. Briefly, BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) transformed with pET11b-MIF were grown to an A600 of 0.7 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm at 37 °C. After 5 h the cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 3% of the original volume of growth medium. Cells were lysed in presence of BugBuster protein extraction reagent, rLysozyme, and Benzonase nuclease (all obtained from Novagen) and serine protease inhibitors Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at room temperature. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was 0.2-μm filtered and applied onto a 55-ml Source Q column, equilibrated with 3 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The column flowthrough containing recombinant MIF was concentrated, dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, using a Slide-A-Lyzer cassette with a molecular mass cut-off of 3500 Da (Pierce) and applied to a 5-ml Mono Q column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The flow-though, containing MIF, was concentrated using Vivaspin-20 concentrator (molecular mass cutoff 3000 Da) (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). Final purity of the MIF product was >95.0% as estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis with Simply Blue SafeStain (Invitrogen). Endotoxin Removal—All buffers were prepared using endotoxin-free 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (Sigma), PBS (Invitrogen), and cell culture grade water (Sigma). Buffers were 0.2-μm filtered. Anion-exchange chromatography was performed to remove contaminating LPS from the purified MIF. A 55-ml Source Q column was treated with 2 column volumes of 1 m NaOH followed by 2 column volumes of pyrogen-free water through 5 cycles to remove all matrix-bound endotoxin and equilibrated with three column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Concentrated MIF was applied and eluted with the flow-through fraction. LPS contamination of the resulting MIF protein was measured using two different quantitative chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysis test kits, limulus amebocyte lysis chromogenic end-point assay kit (HyCult Biotechnology) and QCL-1000 chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysis end-point assay (BioWhittaker). Consistent results were obtained using both kits in 2 repeated measurements. The level of LPS contamination in this MIF fraction was significantly lowered, but to reduce LPS contamination even further, MIF was subjected to a second endotoxin-removal step using anion-exchange chromatography on a Vivapure Q Maxi H spin-column (Vivascience). The column was treated with 10 ml of 0.5 m NaOH (500 × g for 5 min) then washed with sterile pyrogen-free PBS (3 × 20 ml) and once with distilled pyrogen-free water (20 ml, 500 × g for 5 min) and equilibrated with pyrogen-free 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. MIF was applied onto the column in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and spun at 500 × g for 5 min. The flow-through was collected into a fresh pyrogen-free tube. The eluted MIF was assayed by Bradford assay for protein concentration (Pierce) and by measuring absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ = 1.22 m–1 cm–1). The resulting MIF sample was >99.9% pure as judged by qualitative analysis on SDS-PAGE. This final preparation was reassayed using the quantitative endotoxin ELISAs as described above. Peptide Mass Fingerprinting and Edman Degradation—Ingel trypsin digestion and analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization peptide mass-fingerprinting mass spectrometry were carried out using an Ultraflex instrument (Bruker). The N terminus of recombinant MIF was determined by Edman degradation using Applied Biosystems Procise-494 protein sequencer following the manufacturer's protocol. ELISA—Purified MIF was analyzed by ELISA using human MIF Quantikine immunoassay kit (R&D Systems) following manufacturer's protocol. Linear correlation of purified MIF immunoreactivity versus diluted standard confirmed the identity and concentration estimations made using the Bradford assay and measurement of absorbance at 280 nm. TNF-α levels in cell supernatants were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions using the capture antibody, monoclonal anti-human TNF-α (R&D Systems), coupled to the solid phase in concentration 4 μg/ml. Dilution of samples was determined individually for different cell types and levels of stimulation. Biotinylated anti-human TNF-α (R&D Systems) was used in concentrations of 150 ng/ml. Immunoreactive signal was detected using substrate solutions from R&D Systems. Human IL-12 was measured using IL-12+p40 immunoassay kit (BIOSOURCE), and quantitative determination of prostaglandin E2 was carried out using a prostaglandin E2 high sensitivity immunoassay kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Western Blotting—Protein samples were separated on NuPAGE™ Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) under standard electrophoresis conditions. Resolved proteins were transferred by electroblotting to 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat powdered milk (Santa Cruz), 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS. All primary and secondary antibody solutions were prepared in 1% (w/v) powdered milk, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS. Expression of MIF was investigated using mouse anti-human MIF Ab (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) at 1 μg/ml and followed by sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked whole IgG from (Amersham Biosciences) in a dilution 1:2000. CD74 expression in MIF-stimulated PBMC was determined using mouse anti-human CD74 (Biomeda) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Putative binding partners of MIF, namely Jab-1 and PAG, were analyzed using a 1:250 dilution of mouse anti-Jab-1 Ab (BD Biosciences) and a 1:100 dilution of goat polyclonal anti-PAG Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) expression in PBMC was examined using a rabbit polyclonal anti-TLR4 antiserum (produced inhouse) at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Secondary sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked whole Ab (Amersham Biosciences) was used in dilution 1:5000. Secondary antigoat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (R&D Systems) was used in dilution 1:2000. Biophysical Analyses—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720A CD spectrometer at ambient temperatures. The CD spectrum of MIF was determined at 0.25 mg/ml MIF in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Data were averaged over five scans. One-dimensional protein and two-dimensional NOESY spectra of MIF at 19 mg/ml (1.5 mm) in PBS (5% D2O) with 1024 scans were acquired on a 600 MHz Bruker AMX spectrometer at 4 °C. The two-dimensional NOESY spectrum of the same sample was acquired with x increments in F1 and processed to yxy. In both cases the spectral width in the acquisition dimension was k ppm and presaturation was used for water suppression. Tautomerase Assay—Tautomerase activity of MIF was determined as previously described (19Bendrat K. Al-Abed Y. Callaway D.J.E. Peng T. Calandra T. Metz C.N. Bucala R.

Briefly, fresh stock solution of l-dopachrome methyl ester (2.4 mm) was generated by oxidation of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester (Sigma) with sodium meta-periodate (Sigma). Equal volumes of aqueous solutions l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester (4 mm) and sodium meta-periodate (8 mm) were mixed and incubated for 5 min. The remaining periodate was removed from the orange-colored l-dopachrome methyl ester by chromatography over a C18 reverse-phase column (15 ml). After the column was flushed with 3 volumes of deionized water (45 ml), l-dopachrome methyl ester was eluted with 5 ml of 100% methanol. Methanolic substrate solution was used immediately in the assay. Tautomerase enzymatic activity was measured in the reaction buffers of 25 mm potassium phosphate, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 6.0, or 25 mm potassium phosphate, 500 μm EDTA, pH 6.0. 1 ml of buffer was mixed with 20–30 μl of the l-dopachrome methyl ester concentrate (starting E475 nm ≈ 1.4). After the background rate was monitored, recombinant human MIF was added (0–0.5 μg of MIF). MIF-catalyzed reduction of absorbance at 475 nm was monitored spectrophotometrically. The specific activity of purified human MIF was measured against active tautomerase from bovine kidney (Sigma) with 93% sequence identity to human MIF. Oxidoreductase Activity of MIF—The redox enzymatic activity of MIF was determined according to the procedures described previously (18Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R.

https://openalex.org/W1968820680,"A frameshift mutation generated from a dinucleotide deletion (780-781del) in the GJA1 gene encoding Cx43 results in a frameshift yielding 46 aberrant amino acids after residue 259 and a shortened protein of 305 residues compared with the 382 in wild-type Cx43. This frameshift mutant (fs260) causes oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) that includes the added condition of palmoplantar keratoderma. When expressed in a variety of cell lines, the fs260 mutant was typically localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and other intracellular compartments. The fs260 mutant, but not the G138R ODDD-linked Cx43 mutant or a Cx43 mutant truncated at residue 259 (T259), reduced the number of apparent gap junction plaques formed from endogenous Cx43 in normal rat kidney cells or keratinocytes. Interestingly, mutation of a putative FF endoplasmic reticulum retention motif encoded within the 46 aberrant amino acid domain failed to restore efficient assembly of the fs260 mutant into gap junctions. Dual whole cell patch-clamp recording revealed that fs260-expressing N2A cells exerted severely reduced electrical coupling in comparison to wild-type Cx43 or the T259 mutant, whereas single patch capacitance recordings showed that fs260 could also dominantly inhibit the function of wild-type Cx43. Co-expression studies further revealed that the dominant negative effect of fs260 on wild-type Cx43 was dose-dependent, and at a predicted 1:1 expression ratio the fs260 mutant reduced wild-type Cx43-mediated gap junctional conductance by over 60%. These results suggest that the 46 aberrant amino acid residues associated with the frameshift mutant are, at least in part, responsible for the manifestation of palmoplantar keratoderma symptoms."

Specifically, in cardiac muscle following cell membrane depolarization, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 activates cardiac RyR (RyR2) through an influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In contrast, in skeletal muscle, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 activates skeletal muscle RyR (RyR1) through a direct physical coupling that negates the need for extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Since airway smooth muscle (ASM) expresses Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 and all three RyR isoforms, we examined whether a cardiac muscle type of EC coupling also mediates contraction in this tissue. We found that the sustained contractions of rat ASM preparations induced by depolarization with KCl were indeed partially reversed (∼40%) by 200 μm ryanodine, thus indicating a functional coupling of L-type channels and RyRs in ASM. However, KCl still caused transient ASM contractions and stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in cultured ASM cells without extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Further analyses of rat ASM indicated that this tissue expresses as many as four L-type channel isoforms, including Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1. Moreover, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 and RyR1 in rat ASM cells have a similar distribution near the cell membrane in rat ASM cells and thus may be directly coupled as in skeletal muscle. Collectively, our data implicate that EC-coupling mechanisms in striated muscles may also broadly transduce diverse smooth muscle functions."

GSK-3 has a unique substrate specificity that requires prior phosphorylation of its substrates. However, how the enzyme selects its phosphorylated substrates is unknown. Here, we combined in silico modeling with mutagenesis and biological studies to identify GSK-3-substrate interaction sites located within its binding cleft. Protein-protein docking of GSK-3β and the phosphorylated cAMP responsive element binding protein (pCREB) (using the available experimentally determined structures), identified Phe67, Gln89, and Asn95 of GSK-3β as putative binding sites interacting with the CREB phosphorylation motif. Mutations of these residues to alanine impaired GSK-3β phosphorylation of several substrates, without abrogating its autocatalytic activity. Subsequently, expression of the GSK-3β mutants in cells resulted in decreased phosphorylation of substrates CREB, IRS-1, and β-catenin, and prevented their suppression of glycogen synthase activity as compared with cells expressing the wild-type GSK-3β. Our studies provide important additional understanding of how GSK-3β recognizes its substrates: In addition to prior phosphorylation typically required in GSK-3 substrates, substrate recognition involves interactions with GSK-3β residues: Phe67, Gln89, and Asn95, which confer a common basis for substrate binding and selectivity, yet allow for substrate diversity.

The cellular activity of GSK-3 is stringently controlled in response to growth factors and hormones. However, unlike most protein kinases, GSK-3 is constitutively active in resting cells and becomes inhibited upon stimulation of the cells. This inhibition is achieved through direct phosphorylation of N-terminal serine residues (Ser21 or Ser9 in α, β, respectively) by several protein kinases, such as PKB, p90RSK, PKA, and PKC (2Bardwell A.J.

GSK-3 also may be phosphorylated on Tyr216 located in the activation loop (5Hughes K. Nicolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is an autophosphorylation event as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo cell systems (5Hughes K.

Thus, understanding of how GSK-3 interacts with its substrates may pave the way for design and development of new specific substrate competitive GSK-3 inhibitors. Substrate specificity of protein kinases is a fundamental determinant for the integrity and fidelity of signaling pathways. Previous studies formulated consensus sequences for optimal phosphorylation motifs of protein kinases using oriented peptide libraries, bioinformatics, and computational molecular modeling (15Kemp B.E.

The increasing number of three-dimensional structures of protein kinases complexed with substrates had provided an important basis for understanding the mechanism of molecular recognition (20Taylor S.S.

Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Still, our knowledge of the mechanisms by which protein kinases recognize their substrates is rather limited. GSK-3 has a unique substrate specificity that requires prior phosphorylation of its substrates in the context motif SXXS(p), where S(p) is the phosphorylated “priming” site (24Woodgett J.R. Cohen P.

The three-dimensional structure of GSK-3β showed that three basic residues within the catalytic core, Arg96, Arg180, and Lys205, form a positive pocket that most likely serves as the docking site for the phosphorylated moiety of GSK-3 substrates (27ter Haar E.

GSK-3β-binding of Axin and APC was localized to a hydrophobic site in the C-terminal helical domain (29Bax B. Carter P.S. Lewis C. Guy A.R. Bridges A. Tanner R. Pettman G. Mannix C. Culbert A.A.

This interaction site, however, is downstream from the catalyticsubstrate binding cleft and is not directly involved in the phosphorylation process (29Bax B. Carter P.S. Lewis C. Guy A.R. Bridges A.

Therefore, detailed knowledge of the interactions between the substrate amino acids near the priming phosphorylation site and GSK-3β is still desirable. In this study, we sought to determine the important substrate recognition sites in GSK-3β by combining in silico protein-protein docking of GSK-3β and the phosphorylated cAMP responsive element-binding protein (pCREB), based on the crystal structures of GSK-3β (28Dajani R.

We present a model structure of the ternary complex of GSK-3β, ATP, and the pCREB peptide. The docking model identified specific electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between pCREB and three amino acids in GSK-3β. Mutagenesis of these sites impaired GSK-3 ability to phosphorylate CREB, confirming their importance for substrate recognition. Importantly, additional GSK-3 substrates were affected by the mutations as well. Hence, our studies identified novel GSK-3β sites involved in recognition of diverse substrates, and provide important data for rational drug design of compounds targeting GSK-3.

We selected 3 variants of the p9CREB fragment, with different backbone and side chain conformations. In the first protein-protein docking step, we docked each fragment to the GSK-3·ATP model structure, employing the geometric (35Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M. Friesem A.A. Aflalo C. Vakser I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), weighted-geometric (36Ben-Zeev E. Eisenstein M. Proteins. 2003; 52: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), geometric-electrostatic (37Heifetz A. Katchalski-Katzir E. Eisenstein M. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 571-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and geometric-hydrophobic (38Berchanski A. Shapira B. Eisenstein M. Proteins. 2004; 351: 309-326Google Scholar) options in MolFit. Standard translation and rotation grid intervals were used (1.05 Å and 12°, respectively). The surface grid points that belong to the side chains of residues Arg96, Arg180, and Lys205 of GSK-3 (the primed phosphate binding site) were up-weighted in the weighted geometric docking search, thereby biasing the docking results to include more models in which these residues interact with any residue of p9CREB. The lists of solutions from the four individual docking scans were intersected. Thus, the final list of models included only models that appeared in all 4 docking searches, and each model was evaluated by a weighted-geometric-electrostatic-hydrophobic complementarity score, which is the sum of the (weighted-geometric) + (geometric-electrostatic – geometric) + (geometric-hydrophobic – geometric) scores. The first docking step clearly preferred one of the 3 conformers of p9CREB (see “Results” and “Discussion”). In a second docking step, the preferred conformer was extended by including also the N-terminal helix (N-pCREB; residues 119–135) and docked to GSK-3β·ATP. The best GSK-3β·ATP·N-pCREB model, which was very similar to the preferred GSK-3β·ATP·p9CREB model, was refined by testing small local relative rotations of the molecules (±2°, ±4°, and ±6°) and searching for the best shape and chemical complementarity. Next, we superposed each of the 17 NMR structures of pCREB onto the refined GSK-3β·ATP·N-pCREB model, using the common Cα atoms. This showed that although there is a large variation in the positions of the C-terminal helices of pCREB, only a few of them interact with GSK-3β. We selected a model with only few clashes with GSK-3β for the final modeling step, which consisted of 20 iterations of intermittent energy minimizations of the GSK-3β·ATP·pCREB ternary complex and dynamics simulations (10,000 steps of 1fs in each iteration). These computations also included a layer of water molecules around the complex (10-Å thick). We used the Discover-3 module in the InsightII package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) for these simulations, employing the CVFF force field.

These 3 expression vectors were used as templates for mutagenesis of GSK-3 by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to replace Phe67, Gln89, Asn95, Glu97, and Ser66 to alanine. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations.

GSK-3 proteins were purified using TALON metal affinity resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences Clontech). Cell Transfections and Protein Purification—HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with indicated constructs (5 μg each), using calcium phosphate method as described (6Eldar-Finkelman H. Agrast G.M. Foord O. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc.

Cell extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g. Supernatants were collected, and equal amounts of proteins (20 μg) were boiled with SDS sample buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis (7.5–12% polyacrylamide gel), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. For partial purification, cells were lysed with buffer H (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A 25 μg/ml each, 500 nm microcystine LR, and 0.25% Triton X-100) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g. The resulting supernatants were passed through DE-52 (Whatman) mini-columns that were equilibrated with buffer H. Flow-through and one wash with buffer H containing 0.02 m NaCl were collected. The amount of each mutant was determined by Western blot analysis of DE-52 preparations with αGSK-3β antibody. In Vitro Kinase Assays—The GSK-3β mutant proteins purified from bacteria or prepared from HEK-293 cells were incubated with indicated substrates (200 μm) in a reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 10 mm Mg-Acetate, and 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol) together with [γ-32P]ATP (100 μm, 0.5 μCi/assay) for 20 min or as indicated in figure legends. Reactions were stopped, spotted on p81 paper (Whatman) washed with phosphoric acid, and counted for radioactivity, as described (6Eldar-Finkelman H. Agrast G.M. Foord O. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10228-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For CREB phosphorylation, CREB-EGFP was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody MBL (Woburn, MA) in complex with protein A-Sepharose. GSK-3 proteins were added to the immunoprecipitates under conditions similar to those described above. In “hot” assays, the reactions were boiled with SDS sample buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis. In cold assays, the reactions were boiled with SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis with αpCREB129/133. Similar experiments were performed in autophosphorylation assays except that the substrate was omitted, and ATP concentration was raised to 300 μm. Glycogen Synthase Activity—HEK-293 cells expressing GSK-3 mutants transiently were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-low glucose containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 4 h. Cells were scraped into GS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitors: 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine) and centrifuged at 8000 × g. Lysates were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Glycogen synthase activity was assayed in the supernatants, according to the method of Thomas et al. (39Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) and based on the incorporation of uridine 5-diphosphate [14C]glucose (UDPG) into glycogen. Aliquots of tissue homogenate (15 μl) were incubated with 15 μl of reaction mixture (66.6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 32.5 mm KF, 0.8 μCi/μl [14C]UDPG (400 μm), 13 mg/ml glycogen rabbit liver, Sigma) for 20 min at 30 °C, as described (6Eldar-Finkelman H.

The reactions were then spotted on ET31 (Whatman) papers, washed with 66% ice-cold ethanol, and counted for radioactivity. Glycogen synthase assays were measured in the presence of 0.1 mm or 10 mm glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), and their ratio was calculated. CREB is a GSK-3 substrate phosphorylated directly at Ser129 by GSK-3 (40Fiol C.J. Williams J.S. Chou C.H. Wang Q.M. Roach P.J. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32187-32193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other GSK-3 substrates, CREB requires pre-phosphorylation at Ser133, which is carried out by cAMP-dependent kinase (40Fiol C.J. Williams J.S. Chou C.H. Wang Q.M. Roach P.J. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32187-32193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A minimal peptide sequence encompassing the CREB phosphorylation motif, termed p9CREB (ILSRRPS(p)YR), was shown in in vitro kinase assays to be a GSK-3 substrate (Fig. 1A). In addition, these experiments emphasized the importance of phosphorylation. Namely, replacement of phosphorylated serine by serine (CREB) glutamic acid (E9CREB, mimicking phosphorylation) or phosphorylated tyrosine (pY9CREB) practically abolished GSK-3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 1Phosphorylation of p9CREB and model structure of the ternary complex GSK-3β·ATP·pCREB. A, phosphorylation of p9CREB peptide variants by GSK-3. His-tagged purified GSK-3 was incubated with p9CREB peptide variants in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, as described under “Experimental Procedures” for indicated time points. The reactions were spotted on p81 papers and counted for radioactivity. Phosphorylation is presented as a percentage of maximal phosphorylation obtained with p9CREB substrate. Shown is a mean of two independent experiments. Full circles represent p9CREB. Empty circle, filled triangle, and empty inverted triangle represent CREB, ECREB, and pYCREB, respectively. B, solvent accessible surface of GSK-3β is shown in gray. Residues Gln89 and Asn95 are emphasized in orange, residue Phe67 is colored in light green, Ser66 is shown (only in the inset) in black and the positive primed phosphate binding site is depicted in yellow. The ribbon diagram in the insert (stereo pair) represents pCREB. The p9CREB fragment is colored in dark blue and the N- and C-terminal helices are colored in cyan and blue, respectively. The side chains of residues Ser129 (phosphorylation site), Ser133(p) (primed phosphorylation site), Tyr134 and Arg135, (which interact with Phe67 or Gln89 and Asn95, respectively) are shown. ATP is shown as brown ball and stick model, and the Mg2+ ion is depicted by the magenta sphere. C, amino acid sequence alignment of the catalytic domain of GSK-3β in various species (as produced with the program ClustalW) and alignment of GSK-3β paralogs (CDK-2 and MAPK) and PKA. The latter sequence alignment is based on manual structural alignments (using the program InsightII) of the relevant structures (PDB codes, 1o9u, 1jst, 2erk, and 2cpk, respectively). The numbering corresponds to that of GSK-3. Potential residues for substrate recognition are denoted by yellow or green (identical residues) background. It shows that Gln89 and Asn95 are preferentially conserved in GSK-3. Conserved residues in all sequences are denoted by red letters; residues conserved in two or three sequences are denoted by blue letters. The residues mutated in this study are marked with an asterisk. D, ability of GSK-3 to phosphorylate p9CREB variants, was examined in assay conditions similar to those described in A (and under “Experimental Procedures”). Results are presented as the percentage of the phosphorylation obtained with p9CREB as a substrate that was set to 100%, and are mean of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Silico Molecular Modeling of the Ternary Complex GSK-3·ATP·pCREB—The structure of the ternary complex GSK-3β·ATP·CREB was modeled as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We used the structures of the non-ATP-bound GSK-3β (28Dajani R.

The two structures differ only slightly in the position of the P-loop, but not in the substrate binding cavity. Hence, the phosphorylated GSK-3β·ATP model was constructed by combining these two structures; the conformation of the P-loop backbone and side chains was as in the ANP-bound GSK-3β, and the conformation of Tyr216(p) was as in the phosphorylated GSK-3β. Currently, there is only one available structure of pCREB (32Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) bound to the KIX domain of CBP. pCREB consists of two helices (N- and C-terminal) joined by a loop, and the 17 NMR models of pCREB present considerable variability in the relative position of the N- and C-terminal helices. Our protein-protein docking program MolFit treats the docked molecules as rigid bodies and cannot cope with such structural flexibility. Therefore, we docked pCREB to GSK-3β in steps. First, we docked three representing conformers of p9CREB (residues 127–135) to GSK-3·ATP employing a weighting scheme that emphasized contacts involving the primed binding site of GSK-3β, but did not specify the binding partner (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, it was rewarding to find that the first docking step clearly preferred one of the three conformers of p9CREB, and ranked near the top a model in which the primed binding site was occupied by CREB-Ser133(p) (rank 31 out of 9,415 models obtained after intersection; see “Experimental Procedures”).

However, hepatic and intestinal glucose production can have opposite effects on glucose homeostasis. Glucose release into the portal vein by the intestine increases glucose uptake and reduces food intake. In contrast, glucose production by the liver contributes to hyperglycemia in type II diabetes. Glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc6Pase) is the key enzyme of gluconeogenesis in both the liver and intestine. Here we specify the cAMP/protein kinase A regulation of the Glc6Pase gene in the intestine compared with the liver. Similarly to the liver, the molecular mechanism of cAMP/protein kinase A regulation involves cAMP-response element-binding protein, HNF4α, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and HNF1. In contrast to the situation in the liver, we find that different isoforms of CAAT/enhancer-binding protein and HNF1 contribute to the specific regulation of the Glc6Pase gene in the intestine. Moreover, we show that cAMP-response element binding modulator specifically contributes to the regulation of the Glc6Pase gene in the intestine but not in the liver. These results allow us to identify intestine-specific regulators of the Glc6Pase gene and to improve the understanding of the differences in the regulation of gluconeogenesis in the intestine compared with the liver."

The resulting PML-RARα fusion protein functions as a constitutive transcriptional silencer in the retinoic acid signaling pathway, thereby inducing a differentiation block. Two commonly used treatments for APL include ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). ATRA functions by degrading PML-RARα and releasing the differentiation block. ATO also degrades PML-RARα and restores the level of PML expressed from the unaffected allele, but unlike ATRA, ATO induces a potent apoptosis of the APL cells in culture.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was shown to enhance the proapoptotic effects of the PML protein after ATO treatment. ATO was shown to induce phosphorylation of PML through the ERK pathway, and this increased phosphorylation was associated with increased sumoylation and increased apoptotic activity of PML (9Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was decreased by expression of the PML mutants that contain mutations in all of the sumoylation sites or ERK phosphorylation sites. However, these PML mutants still exhibited a considerable amount of apoptosis compared with the control empty vector, suggesting that PML could contribute to ATO-induced apoptosis by additional mechanisms. Our previous work suggested that PML functions upstream and downstream of the proapoptotic Chk2 kinase in the p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways (12Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K.

DNA damage-induced Chk2 directly phosphorylates p53 and is essential for transcriptional and apoptotic activities of p53 (14Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D.

J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar), we have shown that PML plays an important role in Chk2 activation by facilitating autophosphorylation after γ irradiation and that in APL-derived NB4 cells PML-RARα suppresses Chk2 by dominantly inhibiting autophosphorylation, which is required for full activation. Because Chk2 is critical for p53 apoptotic activity and mutations in the p53 gene are extremely rare in APL (16Longo L. Trecca D. Biondi A. Lo Coco F. Grignani F. Maiolo A.T. Pelicci P.G. Neri A. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1993; 11: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), these results suggested that a chemotherapeutic agent that induces PML-RARα degradation and concomitantly stimulates DNA damage response may restore the PML-Chk2 pathway to induce apoptosis in APL cells. In this study, we have shown that PML potentiates ATO-induced apoptosis, at least in part, by activating Chk2 kinase. ATO modulated ATR kinase activity for Chk2 activation and induction of apoptosis, and PML contributed to ATO-induced apoptosis by facilitating Chk2 autophosphorylation. By demonstrating that ATR, Chk2, and PML play a role in ATO action, this study adds new molecular insights into the ATO-induced apoptosis. Mice and Cells—129Sv PML–/– mice (17Wang Z.G. Ruggero D.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar), p53–/–, and SCID mice were used in this study. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from embryos at day 13.5 of development. Early passage MEFs (<5) were used in all experiments. Splenocytes or thymocytes were prepared from 6–8-week-old mice. Co-Immunoprecipitation Assay and Immunoprecipitation Kinase Assay—Assays were performed as described previously (13Yang S. Jeong J.H. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Pandolfi P.P. Chung J.H. Kim M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar). For detection of γ-H2AX phosphorylation, harvested cells were resuspended in urea-containing lysis buffer (9 m urea, 75 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 0.15 m β-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated for 10–15 s. Supernatants after centrifugation were used for immunoblotting analysis with anti-Ser-139 phospho γ-H2AX antibody. Confocal Microscopy—NB4 cells were treated with ATO and harvested on coverslips. The cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 30 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. After five PBS washes, the cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin at room temperature for 30 min, followed by two PBS washes. The cells were blocked with 1% chick egg albumin (A-5503; Sigma) in PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature for 30 min, followed by two PBS washes. After the wash, the cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-human PML (PG-M3, SC-966, 1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and polyclonal anti-Chk2 raised against glutathione S-transferase-tagged recombinant Chk2 protein (20Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Schwarz J.K. Mitiku N. Piwnica-Worms H. Chung J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3745-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) at 4 °C overnight. After PBS washes, the cells were incubated with Texas Red-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:75 dilution; Vector Laboratories) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:75 dilution; Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. After washing extensively in PBS and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, cells were further washed in water and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured using a Leica SP confocal microscope. Small Interference RNA Experiments—The small interference RNA constructs targeting human ATR, human Chk1, and GFP were generated by inserting cDNA sequences of ATR (5′-GGGAGCCTGTTGAGACAAGATTA-3′), Chk1 (5′-GGGAGAAGGTGCCTATGGAGAAA-3′), or GFP (5′-GGGCGATGCCACCTACGGCAAGA-3′) into REP4-Puro episomal vector under the control of U6 promoter (21Kang H. Cui K. Zhao K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1188-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Puromycin (20 μg/ml) was added to the culture after 24 h of transfection, and cells were cultured in the presence of Puromycin for 1–2 weeks. Culture media were changed every 2–3 days and Puromycin-resistant cells were used to examine the ATO effect. Real-time PCR Analysis—RNAs were isolated from splenocytes or thymocytes from various null mice and HeLa cells expressing ATR siRNA and the control siRNA. Puma induction was examined by reverse transcription PCR. A pair of primers specific to each gene was purchased from Applied Biosystems, Inc.: Puma (Mm 00519268_m1); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (internal control, Mm 99999915-g1). The relative amounts of specifically amplified cDNA were calculated using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control. Data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase level. Apoptosis and Cell Death Analysis—Splenocytes or thymocytes derived from 6–8-week-old ATM–/–, ATR+/–, PML–/–, Chk2–/–, p53–/– mice and the corresponding wild-type mice were treated with ATO for the indicated hours and stained with Annexin V and propidium iodide (Roche Applied Science). Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometric analysis. Values were normalized to the number of apoptotic cells remaining in untreated cultures derived from the same animal. In our previous study, we have shown that PML and Chk2 interact in vivo and some Chk2 exist in the PML-containing nuclear foci termed PML nuclear bodies (NB) (12Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In APL-derived NB4 cells, PML NBs are disrupted and PML is dispersed in microspeckles. Because ATO treatment restores PML NBs upon PML-RARα degradation and PML interacts with Chk2, it was expected that ATO would induce relocalization of a subpopulation of Chk2 into the PML NBs in NB4 cells. Indeed, Chk2 staining in PML NBs was observed in NB4 cells starting after 6–8 h of ATO treatment (supplemental Fig. S1, 2 μm ATO). Longer exposure of ATO (36–48 h) caused disappearance of PML NBs in NB4 cells as reported in other studies (22Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Guillemin M.C. Janin A. Daniel M.T. Degos L. Kogan S.C. Bishop J.M. de The H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar); however, Chk2 degradation was not observed as detected by the anti-Chk2 immunoblotting experiment (not shown). We were then curious to know whether ATO affects Chk2 activation (Fig. 1). Activation of Chk2 requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases ATM and ATR, which sense DNA damage (15Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Another upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase, DNA-dependent protein kinase, is also known to regulate Chk2 after γ irradiation (23Li J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Once activated by γ irradiation, Chk2 activity may be sustained up to 24 h (12Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of threonine 68 by ATM/ATR or DNA-dependent protein kinase leads to autophosphorylation of threonines 383 and 387 (Thr-383/387) in the activation loop, a required step for full activation of Chk2 (15Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 421-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, a and b, ATO treatment alone was sufficient to cause Thr-68 and Thr-383/387 phosphorylation in NB4 cells and 293T cells. Chk2 activation was also observed in U937 cells or HL60 cells (not shown) suggesting that PML-RARα is not required for ATO-induced Chk2 phosphorylation. Kinetics of ATO-induced Chk2 activation in NB4 cells was slower than that after γ irradiation (Thr-68 phosphorylation of Chk2 after γ irradiation, not shown). Unlike APL cells where apoptosis occurs at low concentrations of ATO, apoptosis in cell systems other than APL was shown to require 5–10 μm concentration of ATO (24Fojo T. Bates S. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the experiments in Fig. 1 and most experiments in this study, we used 1–10 μm concentration of ATO that was reported to overlap with the physiologically tolerable concentration (9Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As shown in our previous study (13Yang S. Jeong J.H. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Pandolfi P.P. Chung J.H. Kim M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar), ATRA treatment, which does not induce DNA damage but reestablishes PML NBs by degrading PML-RARα, did not result in Thr-68 phosphorylation in NB4 cells (Fig. 1b). Low dose γ irradiation that delivers DNA double strand breaks without causing PML-RARα degradation induced Thr-68 phosphorylation but no autophosphorylation (phosphorylation of Thr-383 and Thr-387) in NB4 cells. These results demonstrated that ATO activates Chk2, and this was also confirmed with the immune complex kinase assay (Fig. 1c). In Fig. 2a, ATO induced H2AX phosphorylation (Ser-139) in NB4 cells with similar kinetics to that of Chk2 Thr-68 phosphorylation (Chk2 level, not shown). Because ATM or ATR rapidly phosphorylates H2AX after DNA double strand breaks (25Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 26Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4049) Google Scholar), ATO-induced Chk2 activation and H2AX phosphorylation suggested the possibility that ATO might generate DNA lesions. Alternatively, ATO may activate Chk2 or ATM/ATR through the inhibition of phosphatases for these kinases. We then thought that ATM, which phosphorylates Chk2 Thr-68 and H2AX after γ irradiation, may be one of the upstream kinases that activate Chk2 in response to ATO. However, in NB4 cells ATO did not induce ATM autophosphorylation, a hallmark of activated ATM, at the same dose and time points that it induced H2AX phosphorylation and Chk2 Thr-68 phosphorylation (Fig. 2a, ATM autophosphorylation after γ irradiation, not shown). Consistent with this, ATO treatment resulted in phosphorylation of H2AX and Chk2 in both AT+ and AT– cells (Fig. 2b, upper panel and lower left panel) and lymphocytes derived from ATM+/+ and ATM–/– mice (not shown). In AT+ cells, ATM autophosphorylation after ATO treatment was negligible compared with what occurred after 2 Gy γ irradiation. Similarly, ATO-induced phosphorylation of H2AX and Chk2 was also observed in splenocytes derived from DNA-dependent protein kinase-deficient SCID mice (severe combined immunodeficiency) (27Blunt T. Gell D. Fox M. Taccioli G.E. Lehmann A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10285-10290Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2b, lower right panel). These results indicated that ATO-stimulated phosphorylation of H2AX and Chk2 is mediated by a kinase(s) other than ATM or DNA-dependent protein kinase. One possibility was that ATR, which is known to activate Chk2 in response to UV irradiation or hydroxyurea (28Chaturvedi P. Eng W.K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A. Johnson R.K. Winkler J.D. Zhou B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4047-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), plays a role in ATO action. ATR mediates cell cycle checkpoint by phosphorylating (serine 345) and activating the effector kinase Chk1 in response to stalled replication forks, UV damage, single strand DNA breaks, and double strand DNA breaks (29Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 30Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 31Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Although ATR is the main kinase responding to replication stress after the treatment with hydroxyurea or UV irradiation (32Ward I.M. Minn K. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9677-9680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), UV-induced ATR activation was observed in non-replicating human fibroblasts, indicating that ATR activation can occur independent of replication stress (33O'Driscoll M. Ruiz-Perez V.L. Woods C.G. Jeggo P.A. Goodship J.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). To examine whether ATR is involved in ATO action, we tested whether ATO induces ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1. As shown in Fig. 2c, ATO induced Chk1 phosphorylation (Ser-345) in NB4 cells and 293 T cells, suggesting that ATR may be involved in ATO action. The level of Chk1 or ATR (not shown) did not change significantly within 24 h of treatment, and ATRA treatment in NB4 cells did not cause Chk1 activation (not shown). As expected, ATO induced Chk1 phosphorylation in AT+, AT– cells (not shown). Interestingly, Chk1 phosphorylation by ATO occurred much earlier than phosphorylation of H2AX or Chk2(Thr-68) in NB4 cells (Fig. 2c, the level of Chk2 and H2AX, not shown), suggesting that ATO activates ATR prior to H2AX phosphorylation. At this point, we do not understand how ATO activates ATR, Chk1, or Chk2. One possibility is that oxidative stress induced by ATO may lead to the formation of DNA damage lesions either directly or through replication stress to activate DNA damage signaling. Alternatively, ATO may activate these kinases through the inhibition of phosphatases. We next sought to examine whether ATR activity is required for ATO-induced phosphorylation and activation of Chk2. In splenocytes derived from ATR± mice or HeLa cells expressing ATR siRNA, ATO-induced Chk2 phosphorylations (Thr-68, Thr-383/387) were significantly reduced (Fig. 2d). H2AX phosphorylation was also inhibited in cells expressing ATR siRNA (not shown). As expected, Chk1 phosphorylation was inhibited in cells transfected with ATR siRNA vector. Similar inhibition of the Chk2 and Chk1 phosphorylation was observed with another ATR siRNA (5′-AACCTCCGTGATGTTGCTTGA-3′, not shown). Chk2 or Chk1 phosphorylation in the absence of ATO treatment but after transfection with siRNA vectors (Fig. 2, d and e) may be due to the basal level activation of these kinases triggered by transfected DNA. The results in Fig. 2d suggest that ATO-induced Chk2 activation requires ATR. These results, however, do not necessarily indicate that ATO-induced Chk2 activation is carried out solely by ATR. For example, other upstream kinases such as DNA-dependent protein kinase, which is known to regulate Chk2 and phosphorylate H2AX after γ irradiation (23Li J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 34Stiff T. O'Driscoll M. Rief N. Iwabuchi K. Lobrich M. Jeggo P.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2390-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), may also contribute to Chk2 activation in collaboration with or in parallel to ATR. Because ATO activates Chk1 before Chk2, we examined whether Chk2 activation after ATO treatment is Chk1 dependent (Fig. 2e). ATO-induced Chk2 Thr-68 phosphorylation (not shown) and autophosphorylation were still observed in HeLa cells transfected with Chk1 siRNA vector (Chk2 level, not shown). As expected, Chk1 activation after hydroxyurea treatment was not detected in cells expressing Chk1 siRNA. These results indicated that ATO-induced Chk2 activation is Chk1 independent. In Fig. 2f, Chk1 phosphorylation occurred efficiently in Chk2+/+, Chk2–/– splenocytes as well as in PML+/+, PML–/– splenocytes (not shown). Although we currently do not understand the mechanism of how ATO induces Chk1 phosphorylation in splenocytes, these results suggested that the ATR-Chk1 pathway is not responsible for the differential apoptotic effects of the wild-type and various null lymphocytes derived from the Chk2 or PML mice in Fig. 4. Chk2 autophosphorylation, which follows Thr-68 phosphorylation by ATM or ATR, is an essential step for Chk2 activation and is PML dependent after γ irradiation (13Yang S. Jeong J.H. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Pandolfi P.P. Chung J.H. Kim M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar). Previously, ATO-induced apoptosis was shown to be mediated by both PML-dependent (9Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and PML-independent mechanisms (35Wang Z.G. Rivi R. Delva L. Konig A. Scheinberg D.A. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Gabrilove J.L. Warrell Jr., R.P. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 1497-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATO treatment induces phosphorylation and sumoylation of PML through a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and these posttranslational modifications of PML were shown to be important for the proapoptotic effects of ATO (9Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In other studies, however, PML–/– MEFs were as sensitive as PML+/+ MEFs to the growth inhibitory or apoptotic effects of ATO, suggesting that PML-independent mechanism may also contribute to ATO-induced cell death under certain conditions (35Wang Z.G. Rivi R. Delva L. Konig A. Scheinberg D.A. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Gabrilove J.L. Warrell Jr., R.P. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 1497-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then tested whether the PML status is important for ATO-induced Chk2 activation. Phosphorylations of H2AX, Chk2(Thr-68), and Chk1 were not significantly compromised by the PML deficiency as shown in ATO-treated PML–/– splenocytes (Fig. 3a). Chk2 autophosphorylation was observed in PML+/+ cells starting after 4–6 h of ATO treatment (not shown). However, ATO-induced Chk2 autophosphorylation was impaired in PML–/– cells as shown by the results obtained after 8–16 h of treatment (Fig. 3b, Thr-68 phosphorylation of Chk2 in the PML+/+ and PML–/– cells is not shown in lower panel). Similar results were obtained using 1–2 μm concentrations of ATO for 24 h (not shown). Together with the results shown in our previous study (13Yang S. Jeong J.H. Brown A.L. Lee C.H. Pandolfi P.P. Chung J.H. Kim M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; Google Scholar), these observations suggest that regardless of the initiating source to stimulate DNA damage signaling (γ irradiation or ATO) or the identity of the upstream kinase (ATM or ATR), Chk2 autophosphorylation and activation require PML. To date, we have not observed any direct interaction between ATR and PML (endogenous PML or ectopically expressed PML IV) either before or after ATO treatment (0–24 h, 0–10 μm ATO), suggesting that Chk2 activation may not require protein-protein interaction of ATR with PML (not shown). DNA damage-induced apoptosis requires Chk2, p53, and the p53-induced apoptotic protein PUMA. We investigated the role of ATR and the Chk2-p53 pathway in ATO-mediated induction of p53-responsive apoptotic gene Puma (36Villunger A. Michalak E.M. Coultas L. Mullauer F. Bock G. Ausserlechner M.J. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 2003; 302: 1036-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) in ATO-treated cells. Although ATO treatment increased the level of p53, the induction of p53 was not significantly affected by PML or Chk2 deficiency (Fig. 3c). On the other hand, ATO-induced Puma induction was inhibited in HeLa cells transfected with ATR siRNA vector and in Chk2–/– and PML–/– splenocytes (Fig. 3d). Therefore, ATO-induced Chk2 appears to increase PUMA expression by increasing the transcriptional activity of p53 rather than its level. This is consistent with the previous finding that Chk2 increases p53 activity more than its level after γ irradiation (18Takai H. Naka K. Okada Y. Watanabe M. Harada N. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Nakanishi M. Suzuki H. Nagashima K. Sawa H. Ikeda K. Motoyama N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the role of Chk2 in ATO-induced apoptosis, we measured apoptosis in ATO-treated lymphocytes from mice deficient in ATM, ATR, DNA-dependent protein kinase (not shown), PML, Chk2, or p53 (Fig. 4). Consistent with the observation that Chk2 activation by ATO is not impaired in AT– cells or SCID cells (Fig. 2b), ATM–/– lymphocytes (Fig. 4a) or SCID splenocytes (not shown) were sensitive to ATO-induced apoptosis. ATM–/– lymphocytes showed even a higher rate of apoptosis than ATM+/+ lymphocytes (Fig. 4a). Similar results were obtained after 12 h of treatment in ATM–/– lymphocytes (not shown). The levels of ATO-induced apoptosis in the wild-type and SCID splenocytes were similar (not shown). Although the mechanism for the higher level of apoptosis in ATM–/– lymphocytes is not understood, these results indicated that ATM or DNA-dependent protein kinase is dispensable for ATO-induced apoptosis. In contrast, ATR+/–, PML–/–, Chk2–/–, and p53–/– lymphocytes were less sensitive to ATO-induced apoptosis compared with the wild-type cells, supporting a role of the Chk2 pathway in the ATO-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4, b–e). The decreased apoptosis in PML–/– cells (Fig. 4c), however, may not be solely due to the impaired PML-Chk2 pathway, because PML receives ATO-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling to enhance apoptosis (9Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and PML may influence multiple p53 activities (1Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 2de Stanchina E. Querido E. Narita M. Davuluri R.V. Pandolfi P.P. Ferbeyre G. Lowe S.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) in response to ATO. This study provides new molecular insights for ATO-induced apoptosis by demonstrating that it is mediated, at least in part, by the DNA damage pathway composed of ATR, PML, and Chk2. Although it remains to be seen whether the ATR/PML/Chk2 pathway indeed plays a role in the therapeutic action of ATO in APL patients, it is possible to speculate that, in APL cells, where Chk2 and its downstream apoptotic effectors are functionally suppressed by PML-RARα, ATO may create two conditions required for Chk2 activation: activation of DNA damage signaling and restoration of PML by causing PML-RARα degradation (Fig. 4f). The ATR/PML/Chk2 pathway shown in this study could function cooperatively with the ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways or other unidentified signaling pathways to enhance sensitivity to apoptosis. Whereas DNA damage signaling may play a role in ATO-induced apoptosis, our results suggest that anti-cancer chemotherapeutics that merely activate the ATR/ATM pathway in the absence of PML-RARα degradation would not be as effective as ATO for APL treatment. By inducing PML-RARα degradation in APL cells where the wild-type p53 is expressed, ATO may be able to activate Chk2. This view is also consistent with the clinical findings that virtually all treatments that cause remissions in APL restore PML or PML NBs, underscoring an important role of PML for APL treatment (9Hayakawa F. Privalsky M.L. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PML protein is frequently lost in various human cancers (37Gurrieri C. Capodieci P. Bernardi R. Scaglioni P.P. Nafa K. Rush L.J. Verbel D.A. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and PML gene variants are detected in non-APL hematopoietic malignancies and retinoic acid-resistant APL cases (38Gurrieri C. Nafa K. Merghoub T. Bernardi R. Capodieci P. Biondi A. Nimer S. Douer D. Cordon-Cardo C. Gallagher R. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2004; 103: 2358-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PML loss was also reported to be highly associated with tumor progression and metastatic status in several cancers. Our results suggest the danger of using cancer chemotherapeutics that induce DNA damage response for PML-disrupted tumors: inflicting DNA damage response in Chk2-suppressed cells may confer survival of genomically unstable cells and cause increased incidence of secondary therapy-induced malignancies.

https://openalex.org/W2036776558,"Crystal structures have shown that the conserved TGES loop of the Ca2+-ATPase is isolated in the Ca2E1 state but becomes inserted in the catalytic site in E2 states. Here, we have examined the kinetics of the partial reaction steps of the transport cycle and the binding of the phosphoryl analogs BeF, AlF, MgF, and vanadate in mutants with alterations to the TGES residues. The mutations encompassed variation of size, polarity, and charge of the side chains. Differential effects on the Ca2E1P → E2P, E2P → E2, and E2 → Ca2E1 reactions and the binding of the phosphoryl analogs were observed. In the E183D mutant, the E2P → E2 dephosphorylation reaction proceeded at a rate as high as one-third that of the wild type, whereas it was very slow in the other Glu183 mutants, including E183Q, thus demonstrating the need for a negatively charged carboxylate group to catalyze dephosphorylation. By contrast, the Ca2E1P → E2P transition was accomplished at a reasonable rate with glutamine in place of Glu183, but not with aspartate, indicating that the length of the Glu183 side chain, in addition to its hydrogen bonding potential, is critical for Ca2E1P → E2P. This transition was also slowed in mutants with alteration to other TGES residues. The data provide functional evidence in support of the proposed role of Glu183 in activating the water molecule involved in the E2P → E2 dephosphorylation and suggest a direct participation of the side chains of the TGES loop in the control and facilitation of the insertion of the loop in the catalytic site. The interactions of the TGES loop furthermore seem to facilitate its disengagement from the catalytic site during the E2 → Ca2E1 transition."

In this study, we have examined the effect of S-nitrosothiol transport on intracellular thiol status and upon the activity of a target protein (caspase-3), in bovine aortic endothelial cells. We have previously demonstrated that the specific transport of amino acid-based S-nitrosothiols (S-nitroso-l-cysteine and S-nitrosohomocysteine) occurs via amino acid transport system L to generate high levels of intracellular protein S-nitrosothiols (Zhang, Y., and Hogg, N.

NO per se is a poor and inefficient nitrosating agent (13Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and intracellular systems that catalyze nitrosation from NO have not yet been defined. Although the plasma copper-protein ceruloplasmin has been shown to catalyze RSNO formation (14Inoue K. Akaike T. Miyamoto Y. Okamoto T. Sawa T. Otagiri M. Suzuki S. Yoshimura T. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27069-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), this has not been demonstrated in whole blood containing high concentrations of hemoglobin, a potent NO scavenger (15Wang X. Tanus-Santos J.E. Reiter C.D. Dejam A. Shiva S. Smith R.D. Hogg N. Gladwin M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11477-11482Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). From a pharmacological perspective, however, it has been demonstrated in many studies that the exposure of cells to low molecular weight RSNOs, such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), and S-nitroso-l-cysteine (l-CysNO), can affect cellular processes (16Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Although it is often assumed that these compounds spontaneously release NO in cell culture and that the effects of these compounds can be attributed to NO release, this assumption is almost never tested. In contradiction to this assumption, it has been shown that the effects of some RSNOs have a chiral dependence (17Davisson R.L. Travis M.D. Bates J.N. Lewis S.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), that the decomposition of RSNOs depends upon the presence of cells (18Gordge M.P. Addis P. Noronha-Dutra A.A. Hothersall J.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Zeng H. Spencer N.Y. Hogg N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H432-H439Crossref Google Scholar), and that RSNOs of simple amino acids can be taken up into cells via the amino acid transport system L (L-AT) (13Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Satoh S. Kimura T. Toda M. Maekawa M. Ono S. Narita H. Miyazaki H. Murayama T. Nomura Y. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 20102-20110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously demonstrated that the nitrosation of intracellular proteins by low molecular weight RSNOs does not depend upon the release of NO (13Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that low molecular weight RSNOs, such as l-CysNO, affect cellular processes not through the release of NO in the extracellular space but by transport into the cell and direct transfer of the nitroso functional group to a target thiol. In this study, we have tested the idea that low molecular weight RSNOs affect intracellular thiol modification via a transport mechanism and without the intermediacy of NO. In addition, we have examined whether NO can alter intracellular processes in the same manner as low molecular weight RSNOs. We show, by measuring total cellular nitrosation, cellular GSH levels, and the activity of a specific target protein (caspase-3), that the effects of l-CysNO on thiolic targets depend exclusively on the transport of l-CysNO into the cell and are not dependent on the formation of NO. In addition, we show that these functions cannot be recapitulated by exposing cells to NO. We conclude that amino acid-based RSNOs access a different set of signaling opportunities than NO and that the formation of such RSNOs could be thought of as a bifurcation in NO signaling pathways. Materials—Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC), acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO), caspase-3, l-cysteine, l-cystine, sodium nitrite, diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), GSH, d/l-homocysteine, N-acetyl-d/l-penicillamine, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), CHAPS, EDTA, iodine, mercury chloride, and protease inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma. Dithiothreitol (DTT), HEPES, hydrochloric acid, potassium iodide, potassium phosphate monobasic, potassium phosphate dibasic, and sodium hydroxide were obtained from Fisher. l-glutamic acid monosodium salt monohydrate and sulfanilamide were supplied by Aldrich. (Z)-1-[N-(3-Ammoniopropyl)-N-[4-(3-aminopropylammonio)butyl]-amino]diazen-1ium-1,2-diolate (Sper/NO) was from Cayman Chemical. 2-(N,N-Diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide (Dea/NO) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were purchased from Cambrex Corp. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, streptomycin/penicillin, Hepes buffer solution, PBS, trypsin EDTA, and Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) were obtained from Invitrogen, and fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone. Oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) was purified from fresh human blood as described previously (22Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers of Biology. North Holland Publishing, Amsterdam1971: 1-12Google Scholar) and was reacted with NEM to block free thiols followed by purification on G25 Sephadex column. OxyHb concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 577 nm (ϵ577 cm–1 = 14.4 mm–1). GSNO, SNAP, and l-CysNO were synthesized as described previously (3Zhang Y. Hogg N. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L467-L474Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23Hart T.

Commun. 1978; : 249-250Crossref Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Treatment—BAECs were routinely cultured as described previously (25Zhang Y. Keszler A. Broniowska K.A. Hogg N. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For each experiment, cells were seeded into 6-well plates and grown overnight to reach 70–80% confluence. The old medium was removed by double wash with PBS. Specific compounds were added to cells either in full medium or in HBSS (supplemented with 10 mm Hepes). Cells used in this study were between passages 5–12. S-Nitrosothiol Determinations—For detection of RSNOs, cells were washed twice with PBS, and 250 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm phosphate, 1 mm DTPA, 50 mm NEM, pH 7.4) was added to the cells. Cells were scraped and sonicated (550 Sonic Dismembrator from Fisher Scientific, power level 2 for 15 s) followed by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 5 min). The supernatant was used for measurement of RSNOs in the triiodide-dependent ozone-based chemiluminescence method as described previously (3Zhang Y. Hogg N. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: L467-L474Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thiol Determination—The HPLC-based ammonium 7-fluorobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate method was used to measure intracellular thiols (26Toyo'oka T. Imai K. J. Chromatogr. A. 1983; 282: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAECs were washed twice with PBS and scraped into 200 μl of buffer (50 mm phosphate, 1 mm DTPA, pH 7.4) followed by sonication and centrifugation. 25 μl of sample was mixed with 25 μl of a chilled solution of 10% trichloroacetic acid and spun down to precipitate protein. 25 μl of resulting supernatant was mixed with 75 μl of ammonium 7-fluorobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate (0.66 mg/ml in 2.5 m borate, pH 9.5) and incubated for 1 h at 60 °C. The analysis was performed on Kromasil C-18 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm inner diameter, Alltech) using solvent A (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4, methanol; 98:2), solvent B (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6, methanol; 95:5), and methanol. The chromatographic conditions were as follows: solvent A to solvent B, 0–20 min (0–100%); methanol, 20–30 min; solvent A, 30–35 min. The retention times for cysteine, homocysteine, and GSH were 5.6, 6.6, and 10 min, respectively. Caspase Assay—Caspase-3 activity was induced with doxorubicin (0.5 μm, 8 h in full medium). After double wash with PBS, specific compounds were added to cells in HBSS and incubated for 1 h. For detection of caspase-3 activity, cells were lysed in buffer without or with 5 mm DTT (50 mm HEPES, 5 mm CHAPS, pH 7.4) followed by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). Caspase-3 activity in resulting supernatants was determined by measuring the cleavage of fluorometric substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC in assay buffer without or with 10 mm DTT (20 mm HEPES, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). After incubating at 37 °C for 1 h, fluorescence was monitored (excitation 360 nm, emission 460 nm). The specificity of the assay was confirmed with purified caspase-3 and the caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO. Statistical Analysis—All data presented in this study represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test. A two-tailed value of p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All comparatives made in the study were significant to at least this level. Effects of RSNO and NO on Intracellular S-Nitrosation in BAEC—We have previously demonstrated that exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to the low molecular weight RSNO, l-CysNO, but not the NO donor, Sper/NO, resulted in extensive intracellular RSNO formation. We have also demonstrated that l-CysNO, but not GSNO, is directly transported in RAW 264.7 cells via L-AT transport system (13Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We first examined whether BAEC behaved in a qualitatively similar way. As shown in Fig. 1A, incubation of cells with either Sper/NO or GSNO resulted in a modest increase in intracellular RSNO levels as measured by triiodide-based chemiluminescence. However, incubation with l-CysNO resulted in ∼100-fold higher levels. The RSNOs in cell lysate were retained by a 3-kDa cut off Centricon filter, indicating that the vast majority of detected RSNOs were protein-associated (data not shown). In all cases, treatment of samples with HgCl2 diminished the signal by greater than 95%, demonstrating that the majority of the chemiluminescence signal was derived from RSNOs and not from other nitroso or nitrosyl species. To examine whether the L-AT system was involved in l-CysNO transport in BAEC, we examined the effects of l-leucine, a competitor for the L-AT system, on intracellular RSNO formation. As shown in Fig. 1A, l-leucine inhibited intracellular RSNO formation. The presence of oxyHb, a potent NO scavenger, did not affect the level of intracellular RSNO formed during incubation of BAEC with l-CysNO. This confirms that l-CysNO directly modifies intra-cellular thiols without the intermediacy of NO. In this and all following experiments, we have used oxyHb that has been pretreated with NEM to prevent loss of l-CysNO due to transnitrosation to hemoglobin thiols (27Zaman K. Palmer L.A. Doctor A. Hunt J.F. Gaston B. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, the formation of intracellular RSNO after exposure of cells to l-CysNO is concentration-dependent, approaching a maximum of about 20 nmol of RSNO/mg of protein. These results indicate that BAEC are qualitatively identical to RAW 264.7 cells with respect to RSNO transport. Effects of l-CysNO Uptake on Intracellular GSH—The concentration dependence of l-CysNO on the level of intracellular GSH is shown in Fig. 2A. At low concentrations, l-CysNO had no significant effect on GSH levels, but above 40 μm l-CysNO, GSH was substantially depleted in a concentration-dependent manner. At 400 μm l-CysNO, less than 5% of the original GSH level remained. In contrast, treatment with 400 μm Sper/NO for 1 h resulted in the drop in GSH concentration to 72.0 ± 0.5% of control levels (data not shown). To examine whether l-CysNO-dependent GSH depletion depended upon the transport of l-CysNO, we examined the effect of l- and d-leucine. As shown in Fig. 2B, l-leucine strongly inhibited l-CysNO-mediated GSH depletion, whereas d-leucine was much less effective, indicating that uptake of l-CysNO via the L-AT system was required for GSH depletion. OxyHb did not affect l-CysNO-mediated GSH depletion, excluding the involvement of NO in this process. In combination, these data show that l-CysNO uptake results in the formation of intracellular RSNO and the loss of GSH. It has previously been demonstrated that GSH-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (GSH-FDH) exhibits an NADH-dependent GSNO reductase activity, which could account for GSH loss (28Jensen D.E. Belka G.K. Du Bois G.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 29Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). By this mechanism, l-CysNO enters the cell and transfers the nitroso group to GSH, forming GSNO, which is a substrate for GSH-FDH. To examine whether BAECs contain a GSNO reductase, we examined GSNO-dependent NADH oxidation by BAEC cell lysate. No increase in NADH oxidation was observed in the absence of cell lysate at all GSNO concentrations tested. In the presence of BAEC cell lysate, we observed a robust GSNO reductase activity that was NADH- but not NADPH-dependent (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2C, this activity obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, giving a Km value of 7 ± 1.8 μm. This value is somewhat lower than the published value of 28 μm for purified GSH-FDH (28Jensen D.E. Belka G.K. Du Bois G.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we monitored the change in absorption of NADH at 340 nm. Although GSNO also absorbs light at this wavelength, its extinction coefficient is about 10% of NADH. When a correction was made for this (assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry for NADH:GSNO), Vmax was reduced by 10%, but there was no effect on the Km. Effects of l-CysNO and hCysNO on Intracellular Thiol Levels—Incubation of BAEC with l-CysNO resulted in an increase in intracellular cysteine levels (Fig. 2A). This increase exhibited little concentration dependence and was maximal at the lowest concentration tested. To examine whether this increase in cysteine was also attributable to uptake via the L-AT system, we examined the effects of l-leucine on intracellular cysteine levels after exposure to l-CysNO. As shown in Fig. 3, l-leucine significantly inhibited (p = 0.015) the accumulation of intracellular cysteine, although the effect was not dramatic. We have previously demonstrated that homocysteine could facilitate GSNO-dependent intracellular nitrosation, suggesting that hCysNO is also a substrate for the L-AT receptor (13Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, we examined the effect of hCysNO on intracellular thiol levels. In a similar manner to l-CysNO, hCysNO caused a drop in intracellular GSH levels (data not shown) and an increase in intracellular homocysteine levels by a mechanism that can be extensively inhibited by l-leucine. These data suggest that nitrosated thiolic amino acids are taken up intact into cells as opposed to transfer of only the nitroso group across the membrane. Inhibition of Caspase-3—To examine whether the uptake of l-CysNO can affect the activity of a target protein, we induced the activation of caspase-3 in BAEC by preincubation with doxorubicin (30Wang S. Konorev E.A. Kotamraju S. Joseph J. Kalivendi S. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25535-25543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with doxorubicin increased caspase-3 activity ∼20-fold over control levels (see legends of Figs. 4 and 5), and the measured activity was reduced to control levels in the presence of the caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO (data not shown). For the following studies, the activity of caspase-3 was assayed both without and with DTT. The ratio of these two values gives an index of the amount of enzyme that was inhibited by reversible modification of the active site thiol. Incubation of doxorubicin-pretreated BAEC with l-CysNO had little effect on caspase-3 activity in the presence of DTT, apart from a 26 ± 5% drop at the highest concentration used (400 μm). As shown in Fig. 4, the ratio of DTT-untreated:DTT-treated caspase-3 activity decreased at 80 μm l-CysNO and above, indicating that higher concentrations of l-CysNO are able to modify caspase-3 at the critical active site thiol and inhibit enzyme activity.FIGURE 5Effects of CysNO transport on caspases-3-like activity. BAECs were incubated with doxorubicin (0.5 μm) for 8 h in medium to induce caspase-3 activity. A, cells were washed and incubated for a further 1 h with various low molecular weight RSNOs (400 μm) and NO donors (400 μm). Caspase-3-like activity was determined in the cell lysates in the presence and absence of DTT and expressed as the ratio caspase-3 activity–DTT:caspase-3 activity + DTT. Caspase-3 activity for untreated cells was 4.3 ± 0.1 pmol of AMC/mg/min (with DTT) and 3.0 ± 0.23 pmol of AMC/mg/min (without DTT); caspase-3 activity for cells treated only with doxorubicin (control) was 115.8 ± 5.8 pmol of AMC/mg/min (with DTT) and 102.0 ± 3.7 pmol of AMC/mg/min (without DTT). The data represent mean ± S.E. (n = 3). B, cells were washed and incubated for a further 1 h with l-CysNO (160 μm) in the absence or presence of l-Leu (8 mm) or oxyHb (160 μm). The caspase-3-like activity was determined in the cell lysates in the presence or absence of DTT and expressed as the ratio caspase-3 activity–DTT:caspase-3 activity + DTT. Caspase-3 activity for untreated cells was 4.6 ± 0.2 pmol of AMC/mg/min (with DTT) and 4.6 ± 0.1 pmol of AMC/mg/min (without DTT); caspase-3 activity for cells treated only with doxorubicin (control) was 99.6 ± 6.2 pmol of AMC/mg/min (with DTT) and 99.4 ± 1.5 pmol of AMC/mg/min (without DTT). The data represent mean ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine whether RSNOs or NO donors could produce the same level of caspase-3 inhibition, we incubated doxorubicin-pretreated cells with the non-transportable RSNOs, GSNO, and SNAP and with the NO donors, Sper/NO and Dea/NO. As shown in Fig. 5A, these compounds had little or no effect on caspase-3 activity. In addition, oxyHb, had no effect on the l-CysNO-mediated inhibition of caspase-3, indicating that NO release does not contribute to this effect (Fig. 5B). The effect of l-leucine on caspase-3 inhibition is also shown in Fig. 5B. As can be seen, l-leucine substantially reversed caspase-3 inhibition by l-CysNO. In combination, these data indicate that the inhibition of caspase-3 activity by l-CysNO occurs via uptake of l-CysNO by the L-AT system followed by covalent modification of caspase-3 thiols without the necessity of NO release. The Relationship between Intracellular RSNO Level, GSH Depletion, and the Inhibition of Caspase-3 Activity—Fig. 6 plots the decrease in GSH concentration and the ratio of DTT-untreated:DTT-treated caspase-3 activity as a function of intracellular RSNO level after treatment of BAEC with l-CysNO. Several interesting points can be observed when the data are plotted in this way. Firstly, a significant level of intracellular RSNO can be sustained without either GSH depletion or inhibition of caspase activity. Secondly, the inhibition of caspase activity by l-CysNO parallels the loss of GSH. Thirdly, maximal inhibition of caspase activity occurs when GSH is extensively depleted. These data indicate that caspase-3 is not a sensitive target for inhibition by l-CysNO and that other proteins can be nitrosated at lower levels of l-CysNO and without loss of GSH. It was previously suggested that the L-AT transport system was responsible for mediating the uptake of l-CysNO as l-leucine, a competitor for this system, was able to prevent some l-CysNO-mediated effects (31Satoh S. Kimura T. Toda M. Miyazaki H. Ono S. Narita H. Murayama T. Nomura Y. J. Cell Physiol. 1996; 169: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that l-CysNO, and not GSNO, is directly transported into RAW 264.7 cells via the L-AT transporter system, resulting in a high level of intracellular nitrosation (13Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated that cysteine or cystine was absolutely necessary for the uptake of the nitroso group of GSNO, again via a mechanism involving the L-AT system (13Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The importance of the L-AT in l-CysNO transport has since been confirmed by small interfering RNA knockdown techniques (21Li S. Whorton A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20102-20110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). l-CysNO and other RSNOs have been used as NO donors in cell culture, and many of the effects of these species have been attributed to the release of NO. However, the above studies indicate that l-CysNO, GSNO, and other RSNOs can affect cells by NO-independent processes. Although this calls into question the interpretation of all studies that have used RSNOs as NO donors in cell culture, it also highlights the presence of a potentially important transmembrane transport mechanism that allows RSNOs to directly influence the intracellular environment without the necessity of NO release. In this study, we investigated the importance of the L-AT system in mediating the ability of l-CysNO to modify intracellular thiol groups. We demonstrate that l-CysNO is avidly taken up into BAEC and that the mechanism is qualitatively identical to that observed in RAW 264.7 cells. In fact, we have observed this mechanism to be present in many different and varied cell lines and primary cells including pulmonary endothelial cells, red blood cells, smooth muscle cells, and neuroblastoma cells (32Kettenhofen N. Broniowska K.A. Riego J. Chen C. Hogg N. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2005; 39: S101Google Scholar), suggesting that the L-AT system represents a universal mechanism of l-CysNO transport. We show that l-CysNO exposure results in a decrease in intracellular GSH levels, an increase in intracellular RSNO levels, and a DTT-reversible decrease in the activity of caspase-3. All these functions of l-CysNO are mediated through transport of this RSNO via the L-AT system and occur independently of NO release. In all cases, the effect could not be recapitulated by a NO donor, nor was it inhibited by the avid NO scavenger oxyHb. This represents a fundamental reassessment of the mechanism by which l-CysNO affects cellular functions. In this study, we have also assessed the fate of the amino acid carrier of the RSNO rather than just the nitroso functional group. In the case of both l-CysNO and hCysNO, exposure of cells to these RSNOs resulted in an increase in intracellular levels of cysteine and homocysteine, respectively. In the case of hCysNO, this increase was strongly inhibited by l-leucine; however, the inhibition of intracellular cysteine was less robust, although significant. This is likely because l-CysNO partially decays to form cystine, which can be taken up via the x –c transport system. These data strongly suggest that amino acid-based RSNOs are taken up into cells intact and that it is not simply the nitroso functional group that is transported across the cell membrane. The effect of l-CysNO on GSH depletion was shown to be concentration-dependent with concentrations of l-CysNO of 40 μm or less having little effect on GSH levels. However, above this level, a precipitous loss of GSH occurred, resulting in GSH levels of about 5% of the initial value. Several possibilities exist for the observed loss of GSH. The first, and most likely, involves transnitrosation (the transfer of the nitroso function group) with GSH to form GSNO in the intracellular space followed by enzymatic decomposition of GSNO to form GSSG. An enzymatic reductase that uses NADH but not NADPH as a source of electrons was observed in BAEC cell lysate with a Km of 7 μm. Previous studies have identified glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (alcohol dehydrogenase class III) as a catalyst of NADH-dependent GSNO reduction with a Km of 28 μm (28Jensen D.E. Belka G.K. Du Bois G.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Mice lacking this enzyme had increased RSNO levels in the lungs and were protected from experimental asthma (33Que L.G. Liu L. Yan Y. Whitehead G.S. Gavett S.H. Schwartz D.A. Stamler J.S. Science. 2005; 308: 1618-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Whatever the nature of the catalyst, it is clear that this activity is robust enough to consume intracellular GSH in the face of high intracellular l-CysNO levels. It is interesting to note that NO per se is a relatively poor GSH depleting agent in BAEC, and others have observed that in cells chronically exposed to inflammatory concentrations of NO, GSH levels have, in some cases, lowered through the inhibition of GSH reductase (34Butzer U. Weidenbach H. Gansauge S. Gansauge F. Beger H.G. Nussler A.K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but in other cases, have increased through the activation of γ-glutamylcysteine ligase (35Moellering D. Mc A.J. Patel R.P. Forman H.J. Mulcahy R.T. Jo H. Darley-Usmar V.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or via induction of cystine transport (36Li H. Marshall Z.M. Whorton A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C803-C811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, the long term effects of NO on GSH levels are complex and involve much more than chemical oxidation and thiol nitrosation. We chose caspase-3 as a target protein to examine the role of l-CysNO transport in inhibiting intracellular enzyme activities. The idea that caspase-3 can be reversibly modified by S-nitrosation has received significant attention. The studies performed by Mannick et al. (11Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) first showed that Fas ligand induced caspase-3 activity both by inducing the processing of the enzyme and by stimulating denitrosation of the active site thiol. In a subsequent study, it has been reported that the subpopulation of mitochondrial caspases is mainly controlled by S-nitrosation (37Mannick J.B. Schonhoff C. Papeta N. Ghafourifar P. Szibor M.

As a result of these studies, S-nitrosothiols and NO donors have been used in cell culture to examine effects on caspase-3 activity. There are a number of reports suggesting that caspase-3 activity can be inhibited in the presence of NO donors or RSNOs; however, the enzymatic activity was often measured in the presence of DTT, which can reverse S-nitrosation, making the interpretation of the results difficult. It is important to distinguish between direct effects on caspase-3 activity that occur as a result of modification of the active site thiol versus the prolonged effects of NO on the upstream signaling, induction, and processing of the procaspase-3 to the active form. In studies showing the inhibition of caspase-3 activity after long term exposure to NO donors (12Rossig L. Fichtlscherer B. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Mulsch A. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), it was concluded that caspase-3 was inhibited by S-nitrosation, although the activity assays were performed in the presence of DTT. Studies on monocyte survival reported that relatively high doses (millimolar range) of GSNO and SNAP lowered caspase-3 activity, whereas NO donors did not. In addition, the authors did not find a correlation between NO liberated during the 24-h incubation period and activities of caspase-3 and -9 (38Zeigler M.M. Doseff A.I. Galloway M.F. Opalek J.M.

Again, cells were exposed to NO and RSNO for long periods of time, and activity of caspases was measured in the presence of DTT. Kim et al. (39Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) first reported that long term exposure to SNAP and NO donors inhibited caspase-3 activity by two distinct mechanisms: at the level of caspase-3 processing and activation as well as directly via S-nitrosation. Assays were performed in the presence and absence of DTT. When DTT was present, the total caspase-3 activity was reduced by NO exposure. In the absence of DTT, caspase-3 activity dropped further, revealing the fraction of the enzyme that was oxidatively modified. In our studies, we induced cells to produce the active form of caspase-3 and then exposed them briefly (1-h incubation time) to various low molecular weight RSNOs and NO donors. In this situation, the observed inhibition of the enzyme activity resulted solely from the modification of the active site cysteine. l-CysNO, but not GSNO or the NO donors Sper/NO and Dea/NO, inhibited caspase-3 activity through a DTT-reversible modification. The concentration dependence of this inhibition was remarkably similar to GSH depletion in that caspase-3 inhibition was only observed above 40 μm l-CysNO. This indicates that in this system, the inhibition of caspase-3 by thiol modification occurs simultaneously with a decrease in cellular reducing systems and only at high levels of intracellular RSNO, suggesting that l-CysNO-dependent caspase-3 inactivation is not a particularly sensitive or specific process in BAEC. It is likely that GSH can protect caspase-3 inhibition by two related mechanisms. The first is that GSH will be a sink for cellular RSNO as GSNO can be metabolized by an NADH-dependent process, and the second is that GSH may directly repair nitrosated caspase-3 via transnitrosation or reduction of the active site thiol. Caspase-3 inhibition was reversed by competitors of the L-AT system and was not affected by oxyHb, again highlighting that enzyme inhibition occurred through the direct uptake and action of l-CysNO and not through NO formation. Although casase-3 did not turn out to be a sensitive target for l-CysNO in BAECs, it should be emphasized that our data only examine caspase-3 inhibition via transnitrosation mechanisms from extracellular donors and do not examine the ability of cellular nitric oxide synthase to modulate caspase activity or apoptosis. In addition, Fig. 6 shows that a significant intracellular level of protein RSNO (up to 4 nmol of RSNO/mg of protein) can be sustained without loss of the GSH pool. This suggests that there are more specific and sensitive targets for S-nitrosation that show some stability even in the presence of normal GSH levels. This strongly hints at a hierarchy of thiol sensitivity to this post-translational modification, and a full understanding of this hierarchy will reveal which proteins are susceptible to modification under physiologically meaningful conditions. It should be noted that in this study, we have not determined the nature of the modification that gives rise to the loss of caspase-3 activity. It is possible that both thiol nitrosation and protein S-thiolation could be involved as both of these modification are reversible by DTT. As there is currently no reliable activity-based method to distinguish between these possibilities, specific analysis of the modified protein is required. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the ability of l-CysNO to modify intracellular thiolic targets in BAEC depends exclusively upon its uptake into cells via the L-AT system and not upon the generation of NO. Intracellular thiol modification occurs by transnitrosation to form a protein RSNO or by S-thiolation, either directly or indirectly through the increased oxidative stress accompanying l-CysNO exposure. These data demonstrate that the uptake of amino acid RSNOs by cells represents a potential mechanism by which RSNOs, in extracellular environments such as the plasma or lung lining fluid, can influence the intracellular environment in ways distinctly different from NO. The data also suggest that NO has a very poor ability to transmit signals through the modification of thiols in BAEC but requires prior extracellular conversion to an RSNO and uptake before this avenue of intracellular signaling is opened.

Mutations of this aromatic residue to small uncharged ones result in significantly decreased levels of FeMoco insertion/retention and drastically reduced activities of MoFe proteins, suggesting that Trp-α444 may lock the FeMoco tightly in its binding site through the sterically restricting effect of its bulky, aromatic side chain.

One, designated the P-cluster, is an [8Fe-7S] cluster (9Peters J.W. Stowell M.H.B. Soltis S.M. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Rees D.C.

These metal clusters are essential for nitrogenase reactivity, mediating the ATP-driven, interprotein electron transfer from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the Fe protein to the P-cluster of the MoFe protein and finally to the FeMoco where substrate reduction takes place. Biosynthesis of P-cluster and FeMoco has attracted considerable attention, because these clusters are biologically unique and chemically unprecedented. Both P-cluster and FeMoco are composed of smaller substructures: the P-cluster consists of two [4Fe-4S] subclusters sharing aμ6-sulfide (9Peters J.W. Stowell M.H.B. Soltis S.M. Finnegan M.G.

Nonetheless, while the P-cluster is likely assembled through fusion of its substructural [4Fe-4S] units in its target location (11Dos Santos P.C. Dean D.R. Hu Y. Ribbe M.W. Chem.

Previously, we identified a molybdenum-free, NifEN-bound FeMoco precursor that bears a striking resemblance to the Fe/S core of the mature FeMoco (15Corbett M.C. Hu Y. Fay A.W. Ribbe M.W. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1238-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Most recently, we showed that, upon MgATP hydrolysis, Fe protein inserts molybdenum and homocitrate into the FeMoco precursor while it is still bound to NifEN, resulting in the formation of a fully complemented cluster that can be subsequently inserted into its final location in the MoFe protein (16Hu Y.

Ribbe M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). We also established that the transfer of the cluster from NifEN to MoFe protein likely occurs through direct protein-protein interactions (16Hu Y. Corbett M.C. Fay A.W. Webber J.A. Hodgson K.O.

These findings not only provide important insights into the biosynthesis and biomimetic chemical synthesis of FeMoco, they may also bear useful implications for the biosynthetic mechanism of other complex metal-containing clusters (20Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2006; 57: 623-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 21Rees D.C. Howard J.B.

Though progress has been made toward understanding the assembly of FeMoco prior to its insertion into the FeMoco binding site, little is known about the final step of FeMoco incorporation into its target location within the MoFe protein. Our current knowledge in this regard is largely based upon the crystal structure of a ΔnifB MoFe protein (Av1ΔnifB) from a nifB-deletion strain of A. vinelandii (23Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Consistent with the hypothesis that nifB encodes for a protein that is involved in the biosynthesis of FeMoco, Av1ΔnifB is FeMoco-deficient, yet it contains normal P-clusters (23Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In vitro, Av1ΔnifB can be reconstituted, without additional factors, into an active holoprotein by isolated FeMoco (23Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Given that the FeMoco binding site is fully buried at ∼10 Å below the surface of the wild-type MoFe protein (Av1wild-type), this observation indicates that Av1ΔnifB undergoes significant conformational rearrangements relative to its holo counterpart, a process that renders its FeMoco site open and allows the subsequent insertion of isolated FeMoco (23Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Indeed, when compared with Av1wild-type, the αIII domain of Av1ΔnifB has some major structural changes in that nearly all β-strands are shorter toward their C termini while α-helices A, C, and D are shorter toward their N termini. These conformational alterations create a positively charged insertion funnel in Av1ΔnifB, notably missing in its holo counterpart, that presumably steers the negatively charged FeMoco all the way down the funnel into its final location (23Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A closer look at the FeMoco binding sites of Av1wild-type and Av1ΔnifB (Fig. 1) reveals that, in the case of Av1ΔnifB, the Cα of His-α442 shifts ∼5 Å during the rearrangement of αIII domain and joins two other residues, His-α274 and His-α451, in the formation of a striking His triad (23Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Coupled to this rearrangement, residues His-α442 and Trp-α444 switch their relative positions (23Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Additionally, substantial changes take place in non-liganding residues as well; particularly, the stretch from α355 to α359, with Gly-α356, Gly-α357, and Arg-α359 that normally form hydrogen bonds to FeMoco sulfurs in holo Av1 (23Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These residues are likely the key players in the process of FeMoco insertion and, therefore, serve as ideal targets for us to tackle the mechanism of the final step of FeMoco assembly on a molecular basis. In the current study we examine the role of Trp-α444 of Av1 in FeMoco insertion by combined mutational, biochemical, and spectroscopic approaches. Our data show that substitution of this large aromatic residue for small uncharged ones results in a drastically decreased level of FeMoco insertion/retention, thus suggesting that the sterically prohibiting Trp-α444 may function in the FeMoco insertion process by tightly locking the FeMoco into its binding site. Unless noted otherwise, all chemicals and reagents were obtained from Fisher Scientific, Baxter Scientific, or Sigma.

The wild-type strain AvYM13Awild-type (expressing His-tagged Av1wild-type and non-tagged Av2wild-type) was constructed as described elsewhere (24Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N.

First, plasmid pHR30 was constructed, which contained the chromosomal fragment of nifD and nifK genes of A. vinelandii. Then, a series of oligos was used to create desired site-directed mutations of the nifD gene carried on pHR30, following the procedure of the commercial GeneEditor in vitro Site-directed Mutagenesis System (Promega, Madison, WI). The oligos used for mutations were (i) W444A, 5′-CGTCAAATGCACTCCGCCGATTATTCGGGCCCC-3′; (ii) W444F, 5′-CGTCAAATGCACTCCTTCGATTATTCGGGCCCC-3′; (iii) W444G, 5′-CGTCAAATGCACTCCGGCGATTATTCGGGCCCC-3′; and (iv) W444Y, 5′-CGTCAAATGCACTCCTACGATTATTCGGGCCCC-3′. The resulting plasmids were pHR31 (W444A-nifD), pHR32 (W444F-nifD), pHR33 (W444G-nifD), and pHR34 (W444Y-nifD). Finally, pHR31, pHR32, pHR33, and pHR34 were transformed into AvYM13A using a previously described method (27Page W.J. van Tigersham M. J.

EPR Spectroscopy—All EPR samples were prepared in a Vacuum Atmospheres dry box (Hawthorne, CA) with an oxygen level of less than 4 ppm. Unless noted otherwise, all samples were in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol and 2 mm Na2S2O4. Av1 protein samples were oxidized by incubation with excess indigo disulfonate (IDS) for 30 min. Subsequently, IDS was removed by a single passage over an anion exchange column as described elsewhere (30Bursey E.H. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29678-29685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All perpendicular and parallel mode EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP 300 Ez spectrophotometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA), interfaced with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9002 liquid helium continuous flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments, Oxon, UK). All spectra were recorded at 10 K using a microwave power of 50 milliwatt, a gain of 5 × 104, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a modulation amplitude of 5 Gauss. The microwave frequencies of 9.62 and 9.39 GHz were used for the perpendicular (10 scans) and parallel (20 scans) mode EPR spectra, respectively. Spin quantitation of EPR signals was carried out as described in detail earlier (28Hu Y. Fay A.W. Dos Santos P.C. Naderi F. Ribbe M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54963-54971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Activity Assays and Metal Analysis—All nitrogenase activity assays were carried out as described previously (31Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The products H2 and C2H4 were analyzed as published elsewhere (32Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21179-21186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ammonium was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence method (33Corbin J.L. Appl. Environ.

A. 2005; 102: 3236-3241Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Molybdenum (34Clark L.J. Axley J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1955; 27: 2000-2003Google Scholar) and iron (35Van de Bogart M. Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were determined as published elsewhere. Protein Stability Experiments—Two approaches were used to determine the stability of the purified Av1 proteins: (i) heat treatment and (ii) prolonged storage at room temperature. A total amount of 100 mg of purified Av1 (in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, and 2 mm Na2S2O4) was incubated in a crimped anaerobic vial (volume, 8.7 ml; gas atmosphere, 100% Ar) at 56 °C for 30 s (i) or stored at room temperature for 8 h (ii). Precipitated protein was subsequently removed in both cases by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min (Biofuge fresco, Heraeus, Germany) in a Vacuum Atmospheres dry box. Concentrations of Av1 proteins were subsequently determined using Bio-Rad protein assay, and enzymatic activities of these proteins were determined as described above. Trp-α444 is a highly conserved (∼80%) residue among the currently known MoFe proteins from various organisms; the rest of them contain Tyr (∼20%) in place of Trp. 4These numbers are based on a sequence comparison of known nitrogenase MoFe proteins (SWISS-PROT) using the program BLAST (36Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69707) Google Scholar). The 100% natural occurrence of an aromatic residue at this particular site, and the observation of a swapping in positions between this residue (Trp-α444) and one of the FeMoco ligands (His-α442) in Av1ΔnifB, have led to the hypothesis that a switch between the two residues is required for the large aromatic α444 residue to firmly pack the FeMoco into its final location (23Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Mutations of this aromatic residue to small uncharged ones, therefore, may result in reduced capacities of the resulting Av1 variants in locking FeMoco in its binding site. A series of A. vinelandii strains expressing His-tagged Av1 protein variants with site-directed mutations at α444 was constructed, with Trp (W)-α444 replaced with Gly (G), Ala (A), Phe (F), or Tyr (Y). These strains (Table 1) are designated AvYM18AW444A-nifD (expressing Av1W444A-nifD and Av2W444A-nifD), AvYM19AW444F-nifD (expressing Av1W444F-nifD and Av2W444F-nifD), AvYM20AW444G-nifD (expressing Av1W444G-nifD and Av2W444G-nifD), and AvYM21AW444Y-nifD (expressing Av1W444Y-nifD and Av2W444Y-nifD). Under N2-fixing conditions, 5Only organisms capable of expressing active nitrogenase enzymes are able to grow under the N2-fixing conditions, where no fixed or organic nitrogen (such as ammonia and urea) is present in the culture media. the doubling time of AvYM19AW444F-nifD or AvYM21AW444Y-nifD, like that of AvYM13Awild-type, is ∼5 h (Fig. 2). However, the doubling time of AvYM18AW444A-nifD is ∼12 h, which is significantly longer compared with that of AvYM13Awild-type (Fig. 2). In the case of AvYM20AW444G-nifD, only a negligible amount of cell growth is detected (Fig. 2). Given that cell growth under N2-fixing conditions is proportionately correlated with the amount of active nitrogenase, these observations indicate that a mutation of the aromatic Trp residue at α444 to a small uncharged residue (in the case of AvYM18AW444A-nifD or AvYM20AW444G-nifD) results in a significantly diminished enzymatic activity of nitrogenase; whereas nitrogenase reactivity is largely unaffected when the Trp-α444 is replaced by another aromatic residue (in the case of AvYM19AW444F-nifD or AvYM21AW444Y-nifD). Appar ently, the replacement of Trp-α444 with Gly has a more dramatic effect than that with Ala, which is not surprising, considering that Gly is a smaller residue than Ala. Meanwhile, although the doubling time of AvYM19AW444F-nifD or AvYM21AW444Y-nifD is roughly the same as that of AvYM13Awild-type, compared with AvYM13Awild-type, AvYM21AW444Y-nifD reaches nearly the same cell density while AvYM19AW444F-nifD achieves a slightly reduced cell mass, suggesting that the change of Trp-α444 to Phe (no natural occurrence) has at rifle more significant impact on the enzyme activity than that to Tyr (20% natural occurrence). This could be explained by the fact that the side chain of Phe is slightly smaller than that of the Tyr or Trp. The decreased enzymatic activities do not originate from the Av2 proteins of these α444 variant strains. 6Although point mutations of Av1 have no apparent effect on Av2, it has been well established that the latter is involved in FeMoco biosynthesis and insertion (11Dos Santos P.C. Dean D.R. Hu Y. Ribbe M.W. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because this work deals with FeMoco insertion into Av1 variants, the activities of which are tested by assays that involve Av2, it is crucial to show that the Av2 of the variant strains have normal cluster compositions and function normally in both catalytic and biosynthetic capacities. An approximate amount of 400 mg of non-tagged Av2 was purified from 200 g of cells of AvYM21AW444Y-nifD, AvYM20AW444F-nifD, AvYM18AW444A-nifD, or AvYM19AW444G-nifD, as was from AvYM13Awild-type (data not shown), 7Note that for protein purification, all strains were grown in the presence of a limited amount of ammonia, so that a certain amount of cell mass could be accumulated regardless of the ability of the strain to fix nitrogen. After the consumption of ammonia, cells were derepressed for 3 h, during which process the nitrogenase protein (active or inactive) was expressed. Under these conditions, a consistent yield of ∼200 g of cells per 180 liters of cell growth batch could be obtained for the wild-type and variant strains of A. vinelandii. suggesting that Av2 expression is unaffected in these variant strains. The monomer of Av2W444Y-nifD, Av2W444F-nifD, Av2W444A-nifD or Av2W444G-nifD, like that of Av2wild-type, is ∼30 kDa (Fig. 3A). The molecular masses of all these Av2 proteins are ∼60 kDa based on their elution profiles on gel filtration Sephacryl S-200 high resolution columns (data not shown), indicating that they are all homodimers. Compared with their wild-type counterpart, all Av2 proteins of the α444 variant strains have approximately the same metal content of 4 mol Fe/mol protein (Table 2) and exhibit, in the dithionite-reduced state, the same characteristic S = 1/2 EPR signal of rhombic line shape in the g = 2 region (Fig. 4). These data suggest that all Av2 proteins have a normal complement of [4Fe-4S] cluster and that the [4Fe-4S] cluster can be reduced by dithionite to an oxidation state of +1. All Av2 proteins show the same substrate reducing activities as Av2wild-type, with regard to C2H4 formation under C2H2/Ar, H2 formation under Ar, NH3 formation under N2, or H2 formation under N2 (Table 3), suggesting that they are all fully proficient in their catalytic capacities. Additionally, these Av2 proteins all function as normally as the wild-type protein in the FeMoco maturation assay (Table 3), indicating that they are perfectly competent in FeMoco assembly, a second function that has been definitively assigned to this multitask component of nitrogenase recently (14Hu Y.

However, its receptor is unknown. We showed that annexin II binds to normal primary human marrow stromal cells and the Paget's marrow-derived PSV10 stromal cell line to induce osteoclast formation. 125I-Labeled annexin II binding assays with PSV10 cells demonstrated that there was a single class of annexin II receptors with a Kd of 5.79 nm and Bmax of 2.13 × 105 receptors/cell. Annexin III or annexin V did not bind this receptor. Using 125I-labeled annexin II binding to screen NIH3T3 transfected with a human marrow cDNA expression library, we identified a putative annexin II receptor clone, which encoded a novel 26-kDa type I membrane receptor protein when expressed in HEK 293 cells. HEK 293 cells transformed with the cloned annexin II receptor cDNA showed a similar binding affinity to annexin II as that observed in PSV10 cells. Chemical cross-linking experiments with biotinylated annexin II and intact PSV10 cells identified a 55-kDa band on Western blot analysis that reacted with both an anti-p11 antibody and streptavidin but not anti-p36 antibody. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the putative recombinant annexin II receptor also recognized the same 26-kDa protein band detected in PSV10 cells. Importantly, the annexin II receptor antibody dose-dependently blocked the stimulatory effects of annexin II on human osteoclast formation, demonstrating that the receptor mediates the effects of annexin II on osteoclast formation.

The molecular and cellular events involved in osteoclastogenesis are a topic of intensive investigation (1Reddy S.V. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2004; 14: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Factors that regulate OCL precursor differentiation can be produced systematically, such as 1α, 25-(OH)2D3, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone, or be produced locally, such as interleukin 6 and receptor activator of nuclear transcription factor κB ligand (RANKL), in the bone microenvironment by osteoblasts, stromal cells and immune cells (2Reddy S.V. Roodman G.D. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1998; 8: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, autocrine factors that positively or negatively regulate osteoclastogenesis and OCL activity have been identified. These include annexin II (3Menaa C. Devlin R.D. Reddy S.V. Gazitt Y.

Choi S.J. Dallas M. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which inhibit OCL formation. Except for interleukin 6, the receptors for these autocrine factors produced by OCL have not been clearly identified. Annexin II (AX-II) is a member of a family of 20 proteins that bind to anionic phospholipid surfaces in the presence of calcium. Each annexin has a unique N-terminal amino acid sequence with a conserved C terminus (9Fey M.F. Moffat G.J. Vik D.P. Meisenhelder J. Saris C.J. Hunter T. Tack B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1306: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The structures of annexins have been well defined, but their precise functions are still being elucidated (10Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Annexin II has been implicated as an intracellular protein in endocytosis and exocytosis (11Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149–150: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Davis R.G. Vishwanatha J.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 188: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As an extracellular protein, AX-II participates in cell-cell adhesion and acts as a potential receptor for tissue plasminogen activator (13Kwon M. MacLeod T.J. Zhang Y. Waisman D.M. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 300-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and tenascin-C and human cytomegalovirus (14Siever D.A. Erickson H.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although its role as a receptor for 1α, 25-(OH)2D3 is controversial (15Mizwicki M.T. Bishop J.E. Olivera C.J. Huhtakangas J. Norman A.W. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 91: 852-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), AX-II heterotetramer has been identified as a receptor for the plasmin-induced signaling in human peripheral monocytes (16Laumonnier Y. Syrovets T. Burysek L. Simmet T. Blood. 2006; 107: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). AX-II can exist as a monomer, homodimer, or heterotetramer comprised of two p36 molecules and two p11 molecules ((p36)2(p11)2). The heterotetramer is the predominant species in all tissues and cells and appears to be the active form of AX-II (17Burger A. Berendes R. Liemann S. Benz J. Hofmann A. Gottig P. Huber R. Gerke V. Thiel C. Romisch J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The p11 protein (S100A10), also known as calpactin-I light chain, is a member of S-100 EF hand superfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins. However, p11 has crucial amino acid deletions and substitutions that render its Ca2+-binding sites inactive (18Harder T. Kube E. Gerke V. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It serves as the regulatory unit of the annexin II heterotetramer (19Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Differential expression of p11 and the annexin II subunit (p36) may be associated with different cellular functions (20Munz B. Gerke V. Gillitzer R. Werner S. J. Invest Dermatol. 1997; 108: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We identified the annexin II heterotetramer as an autocrine/paracrine factor that stimulates OCL formation in both human and murine marrow cultures (21Takahashi S. Reddy S.V. Chirgwin J.M. Devlin R. Haipek C. Anderson J. Roodman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28696-28701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the stimulatory effects of AX-II on osteoclastogenesis were mediated indirectly by inducing production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and RANKL by marrow stromal cells and CD4+ T-cells (3Menaa C. Devlin R.D. Reddy S.V. Gazitt Y. Choi S.J. Roodman G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Li F. Chung H. Reddy S.V. Lu G. Kurihara N. Zhao A.Z. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although AX-II can bind to phospholipid surfaces nonspecifically, we found that fluoresceinated AX-II preferably bound to marrow stromal cells and CD4+ T-cells, but not to CD8+ T-cells, and that this binding was Ca2+-dependent and could be completely competed by unlabeled AX-II. These results suggested that CD4+ T-cells and marrow stromal cells express a putative AX-II receptor. Further support for an AX-II receptor include that AX-II binds to endothelial cells in a saturable equilibrium-based and calcium-dependent manner, and EGTA can strip AX-II from the cell surface (23Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, a potential intracellular AX-II membrane receptor has been reported but not characterized (24Liu L. Tao J.Q. Zimmerman U.J. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the AX-II tetramer (AXIIt) binds to a single class of high affinity receptors on the surface of both primary normal human marrow stromal cells and the PSV10 marrow stromal cell line derived from a Paget's disease patient. Using expression library cloning with a human bone marrow library, we identified a cDNA clone that encoded the annexin II receptor that bound to AX-II through the p11 subunit. HEK 293 cells transformed with this cDNA clone bound to AX-II with a high affinity similar to that observed in PSV10 cells. Furthermore, a polyclonal antibody raised against the putative receptor blocked AX-II-induced p44/42 phosphorylation and OCL formation in vitro. Materials—The 23c6 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that identifies vitronectin receptors on OCLs was provided by Dr. Michael Horton (St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK). Highly purified bovine lung AXIIt was purchased from BIODE-SIGN International (Saco, ME). Goat anti-human osteoprotegerin (OPG) neutralizing antibody was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-p36 and anti-p11 mAbs were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Fetal calf serum (FCS) and horse serum were purchased from JRH Sciences (Lenexa, KS). Human Bone Marrow Cultures and Cell Lines—After obtained informed consent, 2 ml of bone marrow were aspirated from the posterior-superior iliac crest of healthy normal volunteers into a 20-ml syringe containing 1 ml of α-MEM and 100 units of preservative-free heparin. This protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pittsburgh. The bone marrow was then processed as described (25MacDonald B.R. Takahashi N. McManus L.M. Holahan J. Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 2326-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mononuclear cell fraction was obtained by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma) and the mononuclear cells were incubated at 37 °C in 20% FCS α-MEM in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (5 × 106 cells/ml) overnight. The nonadherent cells were used in cultures as the source of immature precursors for OCL formation. The adherent cells were kept in 10% FCS α-MEM and used as the source of human primary bone marrow stromal cells (26Lee K.H. Na D.S. Kim J.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These cells did not contain detectable hematopoietic cells. SAKA-T and PSV10 are human stromal cell lines derived from normal bone marrow and marrow from a patient with Paget's disease respectively. Immunocytochemistry—Normal primary human stromal cells were seeded in 4-well LabTek (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) chamber slides overnight. These cells were incubated in the presence of 2 μg/ml biotinylated AX-II with or without a 5-fold excessive unlabeled AX-II then incubated with streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase and finally exposed to 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate. Iodination of the AXIIt and Equilibrium Binding Assays—Soluble AXIIt was iodinated using the 125I-BoltonHunter reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The iodinated AXIIt (125I-AXIIt) had a specific activity of 172.3 Ci/mmol. In some experiments, the 125I-labeled AXIIt was purchased from Perkin Elmer (Wellesley, MA). The equilibrium binding assays were performed in triplicates as follows, 5.4 × 104 PSV10 cells/well were seeded in 24-well plates (Corning Inc. overnight. On the next day, the cells were incubated with increasing amounts of 125I-AXIIt in the presence or absence of 100-fold excessive unlabeled AXIIt (cold AXIIt) in annexin binding buffer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) on ice for 3 h. Cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 2% horse serum and lysed with 10 n NaOH. The radioactivity in the cell lysates was detected with a γ-counter. For the competitive binding assays, PSV10 cells or primary human bone marrow stromal cells (7 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates overnight and were incubated with 20 ng/well of 125I-AXIIt in the presence or absence of an 80-fold excessive of unlabeled AXIIt, annexin III, or annexin V on ice for 3 h in the annexin binding buffer. Bound 125I-AXIIt was detected as described above. Annexin I was not used for the competitive binding assay since it can interact with annexin II (26Lee K.H. Na D.S. Kim J.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The binding data were analyzed with a nonlinear curve fitting algorithm, and the results were presented in a Scatchard plot. To further confirm the cloned annexin II receptor, equilibrium binding assays were performed in the HEK 293 cells transformed with the cloned cDNA. First, HEK 293 cell transformants that stably expressed the annexin II receptor cDNA or pcDNA3.1 empty vector were generated using standard molecular techniques. Then 1.0 × 105 of the stably transfected HEK 293 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates overnight. On the next day, the equilibrium binding assays were performed as outlined above. Biotinylation of Annexin II Tetramer (Bio-AXIIt) and Cross-linking of Bio-AXIIt to PSV10 Cells—Biotinylated AXIIt was prepared using the BiotinTag Micro-biotinylation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The biotinylation was confirmed by Western blot analysis. PSV10 cells (2.5 × 106 cells/dish) were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture dishes overnight and then incubated with or without 2 μg of Bio-AXIIt suspended in 4 ml of annexin binding buffer in the presence or absence of 15 μg of unlabeled AXIIt for 3 h on ice. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1mm CaCl2, detached from the dish by scraping, and collected by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in 470 μl of 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 μl of 100× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 25 μl of 100 mm dithiobismaleimidoethane (DTME) (Pierce) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 396 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) and 4 μl of 100× protease inhibitor mixture for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation, the reaction mix was resuspended in 99 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) and 1 μl of 100× protease inhibitor mixture for 20 min on ice and then centrifuged and resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA) and 1 μl of 100× protease inhibitor mixture. Ten micrograms of protein from each sample were suspended in a native electrophoresis loading buffer (Bio-Rad). The protein bands were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) electronically. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat milk/TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween). The membranes were exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin directly or exposed sequentially to anti-p36 or anti-p11 mAb and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). Positive bands were visualized with the ECL (GE Healthcare). The nitrocellulose membrane was washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween three times between incubation steps. Annexin II Receptor Cloning by Expression Library Screening and Gene Mapping—A human bone marrow cDNA expression library (Invitrogen) was divided into 20 pools each containing ∼2000 clones. Purified plasmid DNA (10 μg) obtained from each pool was transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells plated in 24-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the cells were incubated with 125I-AXIIt on ice for 3 h. The cells were washed 5× with 1 mm CaCl2/phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% horse serum and then lysed in 10 n NaOH. The cell lysates were collected, and 125I-AXIIt binding activity was measured with a γ-counter. The plasmid pool showing the highest binding activity was selected. This positive plasmid pool was subfractionated until a single putative positive cDNA clone (88-5-D1), which significantly increased 125I-AXIIt binding when transfected into NIH3T3 cells, was identified. The specificity of 125I-AXIIt binding to NIH3T3 cells transfected with the candidate clone was further confirmed by inhibition of 125I-AXIIt binding by addition of 100x cold AXIIt but not by 100× cold annexin V. The nucleotide sequence of the putative AX-II receptor cDNA (1182 bp) was determined (GenBank™ accession number AY032883). Chromosomal assignment of human annexin II receptor was undertaken by polymerase chain reaction analysis of a somatic cell hybrid panel (Invitrogen). The primers were CGGAGTCTACTGGCAAAACG (sense) and GCCTTCTGCTGCTATCTAAG (antisense). The PCR amplicon was 356 bp. Mammalian Expression Plasmids—To construct an N terminus FLAG-tagged vector, the annexin II receptor coding sequence was amplified with primers GATCCTCGAGATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGATGGAGCAACATTTTCTTGGCTGT (forward) and GTACTCTAGACTAAGGCTGCTTAGCTCCACAGAT (reverse) using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The underlined sequence in the forward primer encoded the FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK). The PCR amplicon was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) in frame between the XhoI and XbaI restriction sites. The constructed vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Annexin II Receptor Antibody Generation—An annexin II receptor specific antibody was raised in rabbits against the C terminus 70–193 amino acids of the recombinant AX-II receptor protein expressed in 293 cells (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX). Rabbit IgG from anti-sera showing immunoreactivity to the recombinant annexin II receptor was purified with the HiTrap Protein A HP kit (GE Healthcare) and concentrated for immunoblotting and bioassays. The antibody preparation did not contain any preservatives. OCL Formation Assays—OCL formation assays were performed as described previously (28Kukita T. McManus L.M. Miller M. Civin C. Roodman G.D. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 532-538PubMed Google Scholar, 29Takahashi N. Kukita T. MacDonald B.R. Bird A. Mundy G.R. Mc-Manus L.M. Miller M. Boyde A. Jones S.J. Roodman G.D. J. Clin.

Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2733-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 nonadherent human bone marrow mononuclear cells were seeded in 0.2 ml of 20% horse serum and 10 ng/ml recombinant macrophage-colony-stimulating factor in α-MEM with the indicated factors in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates and incubated in a humidified 37 °C tissue culture incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cultures were replenished with a half-volume of the media containing the indicated factors twice per week. After 3 weeks of incubation, the cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde (Sigma) and stained with 23c6 mAb that identifies vitronectin receptors on OCL (27Davies J. Warwick J. Totty N. Philp R. Helfrich M. Horton M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1817-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Positive reactions were visualized with the VECTASTAIN ABC-AP kit and VECTOR red alkaline phosphatase substrate (Vector Laboratories). Cells that contained three or more nuclei and reacted to 23c6 mAb were scored as OCL-like multinucleated cells. Effects of Annexin II Receptor Antibody on Marrow Stromal Cells—Normal primary human bone marrow stromal cells were plated in 6-well plates overnight (1 × 106 cells/well). The cells were treated with AXIIt 250 ng/ml in the presence or absence of the annexin II receptor (AXIIR) polyclonal antibody (0–5 μg/ml) for 24 h. RT-PCR was used to examine RANKL and OPG in RNA expression. Total RNA was purified with RNA-Bee (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Two μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-ml reaction volume, and 2 μl of the reverse transcription reaction mix was used for each PCR reaction. Both RNA reverse transcriptase and TaqDNA polymerase were obtained from Invitrogen. The PCR primers were as follows: RANKL, ATAGAATATCAGAAGATGGCACTC (forward) and TAAGGAGGGGTTGGAGACCTCG (reverse); OPG, GTGTCTTTGGTCTCCTGCTAA (forward) and GGGCTTTGTTTTGATGTTTC (reverse); and GAPDH, ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC (forward) and TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA (reverse). The parameters for amplification were 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles (except 25 cycles for GAPDH) and 60 °C for 7 min as the final elongation step for all reactions. Effects of the Annexin II Receptor Antibody on OCL Formation—Human primary bone marrow mononuclear cells from healthy donors were used for OCL formation assays as described above. The cells were treated with AXIIt (250 ng/ml) with or without AXIIR polyclonal antibody (0–5 μg/ml). At the end of the 3-week incubation, OCL-like cells were scored. Treatment with RANKL (20 ng/ml) and rabbit IgG (1 μg/ml) were used as the positive and negative control, respectively. Tissue Distribution of the Annexin II Receptor—Human tissue cDNA panels were purchased from Clontech. RT-PCR was used to determine the relative abundance of AXIIR transcripts among tissues. The primers used were TTGGGATTCCGCAGAGGTGG (forward) and CAGCACGCCCAGAGTACAGAGAA (reverse). The parameters were 94 °C 15 s and 68 °C for 90 s for 35 cycles and 60 °C 7 min for the final elongation. Statistic Analysis—Results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Prism (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA) was used for statistic analysis, nonlinear curve fitting. Differences between treatment groups were tested by Student's t test (for two groups) or two-way analysis of variance (three or more groups). Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05. Human Marrow Stromal Cells Express a Putative Annexin II Receptor—We previously demonstrated that AX-II binds to CD4+, but not CD8+ T-cells (3Menaa C. Devlin R.D. Reddy S.V. Gazitt Y. Choi S.J. Roodman G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1605-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and to normal primary marrow stromal cells and the marrow stromal cell line PSV10 cells, and this binding could be completely competed with excessive annexin II. These data suggested that annexin II may utilize a receptor to mediate its effects on OCL formation. Therefore, we determined whether marrow stromal cells expressed an AX-II receptor. As shown in Fig. 1A, biotinylated AXIIt bound to normal human stromal cells (Fig. 1A) and this binding was abolished by the addition of excessive unlabeled AXIIt. To determine the binding specificity of AXIIt to its putative receptor, 125I-labeled AXIIt (125I-AXIIt) was incubated with PSV10 cells or human primary bone marrow stromal cells with 80-fold excessive unlabeled annexin II, annexin IV, or annexin V respectively. Binding of 125I-AXIIt to PSV10 cells (Fig. 1B) or normal primary bone marrow stromal cells (Fig. 1C) was significantly decreased by co-incubating with the unlabeled AXIIt. In contrast, excessive unlabeled annexin III or annexin V did not compete for the 125I-AXIIt binding. Therefore, binding of AX-II to the surface of PSV10 cells and primary stromal marrow cells was saturable and specific. We then performed 125I-AXIIt equilibrium binding assays using PSV10 cells to determine the number of receptors/cell and the binding affinity of AXIIt for its putative receptor. When PSV10 cells were treated with increasing amount of 125I-AXIIt, saturable specific binding of AXIIt to PSV10 cells surface was observed (Fig. 1D). As shown on the Scatchard plot (Fig. 1E), a single class of high affinity receptors was detected on PSV10 cells, with a Kd of 5.79 nm and Bmax of 2.13 × 105/cell. Identification of the PSV10 Cells Membrane Protein That Is Cross-linked to Biotinylated AXIIt (Bio-AXIIt)—Biotinylation of AXIIt resulted in labeling of both the p36 and p11 subunits. Western blot analysis showed that p36 had a much higher molar ratio of biotinylation than that of p11 (data not shown). To further confirm that an annexin II receptor was expressed on the surface of PSV10 cell, chemical cross-linking experiments were performed with biotinylated AXIIt. Intact PSV10 cells were incubated with medium alone, biotinylated AXIIt, or biotinylated AXIIt plus excessive unlabeled AXIIt, then cross-linked, lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Blotting with streptavidin revealed two specific bands, a 55-kDa one and a 36-kDa one. The 36-kDa band was the biotinylated p36 subunit, and the 55-kDa cross-linked product contained the putative receptor. The biotinylated 55-kDa band was not detected when excessive unlabeled AXIIt was added prior to the cross-linking reactions (Fig. 2A). To further identify the composition of the 55-kDa band, we blotted the membrane with mouse anti-p36 or anti-p11 mAb, respectively. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 2B, the anti-p36 antibody only recognized the 36-kDa band and not the 55-kDa band (Fig. 2B right panel). In contrast, the 55-kDa band reacted only with the anti-p11 antibody. Thus, the 11-kDa (p11), not 36-kDa (p36), subunit of the AXIIt was the primary portion of the AXIIt that bound to the receptor on PSV10 cells. Expression Library Cloning of AXII Receptor and Gene Mapping—To confirm that the protein we detected on PSV10 cells was an AX-II receptor, we used an expression library cloning approach to identify the mRNA that encoded the annexin II receptor. The identified cDNA sequence (1182 bp) was submitted to the GenBank™ with accession number AY032883. As shown in Fig. 2C, Western blot analysis of lysates from SAKA-T cells transfected with the N-terminal FLAG-tagged AXIIR clone and then cross-linked to AXIIt showed a similar 55-kDa band that reacted to both streptavidin and anti-FLAG antibody. To further determine whether a similar receptor was expressed in other stromal-derived cells, Northern blot analysis was performed with the labeled AXIIR cDNA. Northern blot analysis revealed the predicted 1.2-kb band among the human bone marrow cells, human osteoblastic-like cells (MG63), and stromal cell lines derived from normal (SAKA) and Paget's patient (PSV10), respectively (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the cloned cDNA or pcDNA3.1 empty vector were transfected into HEK 293 cells and stable expressing cells were generated. We then performed radioligand binding assays with the HEK 293 transformants. As shown in Fig. 2E, 125I-AXIIt bound to the annexin II receptor cDNA expressing HEK 293 cells with a high affinity (Kd = 6.3 nm). Taken together, the cloned cDNA sequences encode a protein that specifically bound to AX-II tetramer with a similar affinity as the native receptor. To identify the AXIIR gene chromosomal location, PCR analysis of a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid panel was performed. As shown in Fig. 3A, the specific PCR amplicon using the primer set was detected only from the hybrid containing human chromosome 5. Furthermore, bone marrow mRNAs from hamster, mouse, and rat were used as controls. The specific PCR amplicon was only detected in the human sample (Fig. 3B). Tissue Distribution of the Annexin II Receptor—The tissue distribution of the annexin II receptor was analyzed with a commercial cDNA panel. As shown in Fig. 3C, most tissues/organs expressed the annexin II receptor. Among them, lymphocytes had the most abundant expression. Surprisingly both resting CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells expressed the AXIIR, but the expression of the receptor markedly decreased in activated CD8+ T-cells. Effects of AXIIR Antibody on Bone Marrow Stromal Cells and OCL Formation—To determine whether the AXIIR we identified mediated the biologic effects of AX-II, we tested the effects of blocking the annexin II receptor on the OCL formation by marrow cells treated with AXIIt plus increasing amounts of the annexin II receptor antibody. The AX-II receptor antibody blocked the stimulatory effect of AXIIt on the OCL formation dose-dependently (Fig. 4A). Importantly, low concentrations of the annexin II receptor polyclonal antibody significantly inhibited OCL formation induced by AXIIt. Rabbit IgG did not have any inhibitory effects on OCL formation. As a control, the AXIIR antibody preparation itself did not show toxic effects in OCL culture since it did not inhibit OCL formation induced by RANKL. These data suggested that the stimulatory effects of AXIIt on OCL formation were mediated by the annexin II receptor. We previously reported that AX-II stimulates OCL formation by activating the MAP kinase pathway. Therefore, we examined the effects of annexin II receptor antibody in the presence of AX-II on stromal cells. As expected, the annexin II receptor antibody blocked the p 44/42 phosphorylation stimulated by AX-II dose-dependently (Fig. 4B). We then determined whether the inhibitory effects of the antibody were due to blocking AX-II or inducing an inhibitor of OCL formation such as OPG. RT-PCR analysis of primary human bone marrow stromal cells treated with the AXIIR polyclonal antibody revealed that OPG mRNA expression was increased dose-dependently at the protein level as well (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, when primary marrow stromal cells were incubated with the AXIIR antibody, OPG expression levels increased dose-dependently (Fig. 4C). Since the AXIIR antibody increased OPG mRNA expression in human stromal cells, we then examined whether an OPG neutralizing antibody could reverse the effects of AXIIR antibody on AX-II induced osteoclastogenesis. The OPG-neutralizing antibody only partially reversed the inhibitory effects of the AXIIR antibody on OCL formation ∼30% (Fig. 4E). We previously demonstrated that annexin II selectively bound to CD4+ cells and marrow stromal cells. This binding was saturable and could be competed with excess AXIIt. The data suggest the possibility of a surface annexin II receptor. Our current studies demonstrate that there is a specific surface AXIIt receptor on marrow stromal cells. We demonstrated that biotinylated AXIIt bound to normal human stromal cells (Fig. 1A) and this binding could be competed off with excessive unlabeled AX-II. Competitive binding assays using 125I-labeled AXIIt on the human PSV10 stromal cell line (Fig. 1B) and primary marrow stromal cells (Fig. 1C) demonstrated the excess AXIIt, but not annexin III and V, blocked 125I-AXIIt binding to the cells. Furthermore, equilibrium bind assays indicated that the binding of AX-IIt was to a single class of high affinity receptors (Fig. 1, D and E). Moreover, specific binding of AXIIt was demonstrated with the chemical cross-linking. DTME is a sulfhydryl reaction cross-linker. After the cross-linking and Western blot, a protein complex was identified with an approximate size of 55-kDa. Further analysis showed that AXIIR binds the p11 subunit of AXIIt but not the p36 subunit of AXIIt. The calculated size for the cloned annexin II receptor is around 26 kDa, and the cross-linked protein complex is ∼55 kDa. Although p11 exists as a dimer and connects one p36 on each side symmetrically (32Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Sopkova-de Oliveira Santosqq J. Gerke V. Cell Biol. Int. 2000; 24: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether the 55-kDa band contains one or two molecules of p11. Our results suggest that the cross-linked protein complex contains two molecules of p11. Furthermore, HEK 293 cells stably expressing the annexin II receptor cDNA exhibited a high binding affinity for AXIIt, similar to that observed with the Paget's disease-derived stromal cell line (PSV10). It is well documented that plasmin interact with AX-II tetramer by activating a series of proteolytic changes in the annexin II subunits, which initiate downstream signaling and final biological responses (16Laumonnier Y. Syrovets T. Burysek L. Simmet T. Blood. 2006; 107: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that these proteolytic fragments of AX-II tetramer could act as a receptor for AXII. However, alignment of the cloned annexin II receptor cDNA sequence with both p36 and p11 cDNA sequences did not show any significant similarities. Taken together, we have identified a unique annexin II surface receptor in human stromal cells. Annexin II receptor mRNA transcripts were detected in most tissues examined (Fig. 3C), except the heart, the brain, and skeletal muscle. Interestingly, activated CD8+ T-cells have decreased expression of annexin II receptor compared with resting CD8+ T cells. These data are in agreement with our previous finding that annexin II preferably bound to CD4+ but not CD8+ T-cells. The significance of the tissue distribution of the annexin II receptor transcripts remains to be determined. Our functional studies demonstrate that the annexin II receptor mediates the effects of AX-II on OCL formation (Fig. 4A). We reported that AX-II stimulates OCL formation via the MAP kinase pathway by phosphorylating p44/42. To further confirm the cloned AX-II receptor, we used the polyclonal annexin II receptor antibody to block the stimulatory effect of AX-II on human primary stromal cells. p44/42 phosphorylation was blocked dose-dependently by the AXIIR antibody, consistent with our previous report. The RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway is a pivotal regulator of bone metabolism. OPG is a secreted decoy receptor that binds RANKL (33Mitaku S. Ono M. Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Sonoyama M. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 82: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In human bone marrow stromal cell cultures, treatment with the annexin II receptor antibody increased OPG expression dose-dependently (Fig. 4, C and D). Importantly, these data, again, confirmed the existence of the annexin II receptor, since the polyclonal antibody was raised specifically against the C-terminal 70–193 amino acids of the annexin II receptor. We then examined the effects of annexin II receptor antibody on bone marrow cultures. As shown in Fig. 4A, annexin II receptor polyclonal antibody significantly inhibited OCL formation induced by AX-II at a concentration as low as 100 ng/ml. Although the AXIIR antibody induced expression of OPG, an excess of anti-OPG only partially reversed the inhibitory effects of the AXIIR antibody. These data demonstrated that the stimulatory effects of annexin II in the bone marrow culture were mediated by the annexin II receptor. Taken together, these data demonstrate that this protein is a specific surface receptor for annexin II. Structural analysis with SOSUI (34Mitaku S. Hirokawa T. Tsuji T. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 35Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4988) Google Scholar) and TMPred (36Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166Google Scholar) predicted that the AXIIR is a type I transmembrane protein with one transmembrane domain. Interestingly, only four amino acids are present in the cytoplasmic tail. These results suggest that the AXIIR receptor need a binding partner(s) and/or docking proteins for proper signaling, as does the fibroblast growth factor receptor which signals through Frs2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2) (37Schlessinger J. Science. 2004; 306: 1506-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We previously reported that annexin II up-regulates RANKL via the MAP kinase pathway (22Li F. Chung H. Reddy S.V. Lu G. Kurihara N. Zhao A.Z. Roodman G.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding of the AXIIR to its binding partner activates MAP kinase. In conclusion, we have identified the first surface receptor for an annexin and showed that it mediates the stimulatory effects of AX-II on osteoclastogenesis. Identification of the AX-II receptor should permit further characterization of the signaling pathways utilized by AX-II, identify its binding partners, and allow us to screen phage display libraries for small molecules that induce or block signaling by this receptor. Identification of these small molecules will permit testing their potential utility in diseases associated with abnormalities in OCL activity such as osteoporosis and bone metastasis. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W1983567767,"TATA-binding protein-associated factor 1 (TAF1) is an essential component of the general transcription factor IID (TFIID), which nucleates assembly of the preinitiation complex for transcription by RNA polymerase II.

Here we demonstrate that Drosophila TAF1 protein isoforms TAF1-2 and TAF1-4 directly bind DNA independently of TAF2.

Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the alternatively spliced AT-hook indicated that Lys and Arg residues made essential DNA contacts, whereas Gly and Pro residues within the Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro core sequence were less important for DNA binding, suggesting that AT-hooks are more divergent than previously predicted. TAF1-2 bound with variable affinity to the transcription start site of several Drosophila genes, and binding to the hsp70 promoter was reduced by mutation of a single base pair at the transcription start site.

Biol. 2004; 24: 2296-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Shen W.-C. Green M.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 10Wang E.H. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 263: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); cross-linking studies in Drosophila place TAF1 in close proximity to the TSS of the hsp70 gene (11Wu C.-H. Madabusi L. Nishioka H. Emanuel P. Sypes M. Arkhipova I. Gilmour D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1593-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); studies with purified human TFIID reveal TAF1 as the major TAF species that can be cross-linked to the downstream core element of several promoters (12Lee D.-H. Gershenzon N. Gupta M. Ioshikhes I.P. Reinberg D. Lewis B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9674-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); and TAF1·TAF2 heterodimers preferentially bind initiator sequences in vitro (8Dehm S.M. Hilton T.L. Wang E.H. Bonham K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2296-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Chen J.-L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 264: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, TAF1 domains required for core promoter interactions have not been identified, and direct DNA binding by TAF1 on its own has not been observed. TFIID is a family of complexes with different TAF components (15Hochheimer A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 16Müller F. Tora L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In Drosophila and humans, germline homologs of general TAFs are necessary for transcription during germ cell differentiation (17Hiller M. Chen X. Pringle M.J. Suchorolski M. Sancak Y. Viswanathan S.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1847-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, changes in the TAF composition of TFIID result from alternative splicing of general TAF pre-mRNAs. For example, the human TAF6 pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced in response to apoptotic signals, and the encoded TAF6 isoform, TAF6δ, modulates the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes (22Bell B. Scheer E. Tora L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 591-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, regulated expression of TAF isoforms is an important determinant of gene-specific transcription. In Drosophila, alternative splicing of the TAF1 pre-mRNA generates four TAF1 mRNA isoforms that differ by the inclusion of two small exons 12a and 13a. 3R. J. Katzenberger, M. S. Marengo, and D. A. Wassarman, submitted for publication. The functional importance of TAF1 alternative splicing is suggested by the fact that TAF1 isoform levels differ between Drosophila tissues and are regulated in response to genotoxic stress. TAF1-1 and TAF1-3 encode one predicted AT-hook motif, whereas TAF1-2 and TAF1-4 encode two predicted AT-hooks. The DNA-binding AT-hook motif contains a central core of Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro residues flanked by Lys and Arg residues (24Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). AT-hooks were first described in the high mobility group non-histone chromosomal protein HMGA (also known as HMG-I(Y)) and have been shown to bind DNA through contacts with the minor groove of adenine-thymine (A-T) tracts (25Reeves R. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 277: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 8: 657-665Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The AT-hook motif is found in one or more copies in a large number of transcription factors and components of chromatin remodeling complexes (24Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 27Cairns B.R. Schlichter A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Winston F. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5389-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). AT-hooks may serve as accessory DNA-binding domains that anchor chromatin-associated proteins to particular DNA sequences or participate in cooperative DNA-binding with other proteins. Here we demonstrate direct DNA binding by the two AT-hook containing TAF1-2 and TAF1-4 proteins at the TSS of several Drosophila genes. We find that Lys and Arg residues of the AT-hook are critical for DNA binding, whereas Ala substitutions are tolerated at highly conserved Gly and Pro residues. TAF1 binds the minor groove of DNA with a preference for A-T tracts, especially an AAT sequence element. Direct DNA binding by TAF1 isoforms whose expression is regulated by developmental and stress signals has implications for the mechanism of gene-specific transcription initiation. Plasmids—TAF1 expression plasmids were constructed by cloning exons 12-14 of TAF1 cDNAs into pET21a (Novagen) cut with NdeI and HindIII. The TAF1-1 plasmid encodes amino acids 1696-2065 of CG17603-PA, the TAF1-2 plasmid encodes amino acids 1696-2098 of CG17603-PC, and the TAF1-4 plasmid encodes amino acids 1696-2129 of CG17603-PB. The TAF1-3 plasmid was generated by joining a cDNA encoding amino acids 1696-1827 of CG17603-PA to a cDNA encoding amino acids 1860-2129 of CG17603-PB. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and was used to generate plasmids expressing the TAF1-2 variants mutAT1 (R1793D), mutAT2 (R1816D), the double mutant, mutAT1/2, and each of the 31 alanine-scanning mutants. Purification of Recombinant TAF1—BL21 Rosetta cells (Novagen) were transformed with pET21a-TAF1 expression plasmids and grown to mid-log phase, and protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a concentration of 150 μm. Cell lysis was carried out using a cell lytic kit (Sigma). His-tagged TAF1 fusion proteins were purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Novagen). Eluted proteins were concentrated using Amicon columns (Millipore), and the concentration was checked by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), equalized by dilution, and dialyzed against Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) overnight. TAF1-2 protein used in the DNase I footprinting assay was purified as above except that protein eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S300 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing TAF1-2 were concentrated and dialyzed against Buffer A. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—For EMSAs, complementary oligonucleotides were annealed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Integrated DNA Technology). dsDNA probes were 5′ end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide gels to verify >95% homogeneity prior to use. Sequences of probe plus strands (oriented 5′ to 3′) are indicated in Fig. 5A. Protein·DNA complexes were formed by incubation for 30 min at 25 °C in a volume of 20 μl under the following conditions: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, 5% glycerol, 50 ng of poly(dG-dC)/μl, and 40 fmol of probe. The reactions were fractionated on 6.5% (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) native gels that included 0.5× TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA). Gels (18 cm × 20 cm × 1 mm) were electrophoresed at 4 °C for 2.5 h at 10 V/cm before exposure to x-ray film or a phosphorimaging plate. Quantitation was performed with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). DNase I Footprinting Assay—The 326-bp Sdic DNA probe used for footprinting contained 265 bp of the Sdic promoter (corresponding to nucleotides 11281-11545 of AF070687) flanked by vector sequence. Binding reactions contained 32P-end-labeled probe, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ng of poly(dG-dC), 500 ng of bovine serum albumin, and the indicated concentrations of TAF1-2. The reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min, supplemented with MgCl2 to5mm, CaCl2 to 2.5 mm, and DNase I to 0.16 units (Promega), and incubated at 25 °C for 45 s. The reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of stop solution containing 200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast RNA. Following phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the samples were resuspended in formamide loading buffer and fractionated by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. For sequencing markers, Sdic DNA was chemically cleaved by Maxam-Gilbert A > C and G + A reactions (29Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). After drying, the gels were visualized by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). TAF1 Alternative Exon 12a Encodes an AT-hook Motif—Comparison of conceptually translated Drosophila TAF1 exon 12a to protein motif data bases revealed a 9-amino acid DNA-binding motif called an AT-hook (Fig. 1). Hereafter, we refer to this motif as AT-hook 12a. An identical sequence is encoded by exon 12, and we refer to this motif as AT-hook 12. Thus, TAF1-1 and TAF1-3 proteins contain one AT-hook, whereas TAF1-2 and TAF1-4 proteins contain two AT-hooks separated by a 14-amino acid spacer. The functional importance of TAF1 AT-hooks is suggested by their sequence conservation between Drosophila species (30Schawaroch V. Biol. Linn. Soc. 2002; 76: 21-37Crossref Google Scholar). TAF1 AT-hooks are identical in sequence to the first AT-hook in human HMGA1 and are classified by Huth et al. (26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 8: 657-665Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar) as low affinity type II AT-hooks because they have a central Gly-Arg-Pro peptide with flanking Lys and Arg residues but lack additional carboxyl-terminal residues that contact the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA. Here we have focused on determining functional differences between TAF1 proteins that contain one versus two AT-hooks and characterizing the DNA binding properties of TAF1 AT-hooks. TAF1 Isoforms with Two AT-hooks Directly Bind DNA—To determine the extent to which predicted AT-hooks 12 and 12a bind DNA, we performed EMSAs using a 34-bp fragment of the human interferon-β gene enhancer (INF-β) as a probe and His-tagged recombinant proteins encoding exons 12-14 of the four TAF1 isoforms (Figs. 1, 2A, and 5A) (31Yie J.

INF-β, which contains PRDIII-1, PRDII, and NRDI enhancer elements, was chosen as a probe because it is bound by HMGA AT-hooks in vivo and in vitro (26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16536-16544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TAF1-2 and TAF1-4, the isoforms that contain two AT-hooks, altered the mobility of the INF-β probe, indicating that they bind INF-β DNA (Fig. 2B). In contrast, TAF1-1 and TAF1-3, the isoforms that contain one AT-hook, did not affect the mobility of the INF-β probe, indicating that they do not bind INF-β DNA. These findings suggest that AT-hook 12 is not sufficient for DNA binding, whereas AT-hook 12a in combination with AT-hook 12 is competent for DNA binding. Therefore, alternative splicing of the TAF1 pre-mRNA is a mechanism to control the DNA binding activity of TAF1 proteins. To determine whether binding of TAF1-2 to INF-β DNA depends on AT-hook 12a or both AT-hooks, we assayed DNA binding of TAF1-2 isoforms whose AT-hook motifs were mutated. TAF1-2 isoforms (mutant AT-hook 12 (mutAT1), mutant AT-hook 12a (mutAT2), and both mutant AT-hooks (mutAT1/2)) were produced in which the AT-hooks were mutated from KRGRGRPRK to KRGDGRPRK (Fig. 2, A and C). In the HMGA NMR structure, the corresponding basic Arg residue makes extensive contact with DNA bases within the minor groove, implying that substitution of this residue with an acidic Asp would disrupt the DNA binding ability of the AT-hook (26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 8: 657-665Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). EMSAs showed that DNA binding by mutAT1 or mutAT2 was reduced greater than 15-fold relative to TAF1-2, and DNA binding by mutAT1/2 was reduced below detectable levels (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that both AT-hooks contribute to binding of INF-β DNA by TAF1-2 and presumably TAF1-4. Therefore, inclusion of exon 12a confers a DNA binding activity upon TAF1-2 and TAF1-4 that is not present in TAF1-1 or TAF1-3. Furthermore, the DNA binding affinity of the AT-hooks together was greater than the sum of their individual affinities, suggesting that TAF1 AT-hooks bind DNA in a cooperative manner. To establish the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD(app)) for TAF1-2, we measured the fraction of probe bound in reactions with different concentrations of TAF1-2. Based on maximal binding of the INF-β probe by TAF1-2 at ∼85%, we estimate the KD(app) to be 1 μm (data not shown). This value falls within the nm to mm range of KD(app) for other AT-hook proteins and is comparable with the KD(app) of 4-10 μm determined for the HMGA high affinity AT-hook DBD3 bound to a PRDII dodecamer (26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 8: 657-665Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 38Dragan A.I. Liggins J.R. Crane-Robinson C. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 393-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutational Analysis of TAF1-2 AT-hook 12a—To determine which amino acids contribute to DNA binding by AT-hook 12a we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the 33 amino acids encoded by exon 12a. TAF1 provides an ideal model for characterizing an AT-hook, because residues necessary for DNA binding are contained within the polypeptide encoded by alternatively spliced exon 12a. EMSAs were performed with the INF-β probe and each of the 31 mutant proteins resulting from all possible single Ala substitutions (2 of 33 residues are Ala in the wild type protein) (Fig. 3). Experiments performed using different methods of comparison with wild type TAF1-2 DNA binding resulted in qualitatively identical results (Fig. 3C). In experiments, such as that shown in Fig. 3A, EMSAs were performed using TAF1-2 mutant proteins at 0.5 μm, the concentration required for half-maximal binding by wild type TAF1-2 protein. In experiments, such as those shown in Fig. 3B, EMSAs were performed over a range of concentrations, starting with proteins of equal concentration. Evaluation of the fraction of probe shifted by mutant proteins relative to wild type protein revealed that substitution of Lys1813, Arg1814, Arg1816, Arg1818, Arg1820, or Lys1821 with Ala decreased binding more than 8-fold, indicating that these residues are involved in critical DNA contacts. This result is consistent with limited mutational analysis of HMGA, which shows that Arg residues within DBD1 and DBD2 are critical for binding dsDNA (36Schwanbeck R. Gerharz M. Drung A. Rogalla P. Piekielko A. Blank C. Bullerdiek J. Wisniewski J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14419-14425Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Substitution of Gly1817 or Pro1819 with Ala decreased binding less than 2-fold, suggesting that these residues do not make important interactions with DNA and may instead be important for appropriate spacing of adjacent Arg side chains. The remaining 23 mutant TAF1-2 proteins that contained individual Ala substitutions at positions Val1806-Val1812, Gly1815, or Asp1822-Glu1838 possessed >90% of the DNA binding activity of wild type TAF1-2, indicating that these positions do not strongly contribute to binding by TAF1-2. These data show that the functional limits of AT-hook 12a are confined to a 9-amino acid region and raise questions about the functional importance of Gly and Pro residues, within the Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro core sequence, which are invariant in the current definition of an AT-hook (24Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). TAF1-2 Binds dsDNA in the Minor Groove—HMGA AT-hooks bind the minor groove of DNA with a preference for A-T tracts. To determine whether TAF1 AT-hooks exhibit similar specificity, we performed EMSAs with TAF1-2 and single-stranded or double-stranded INF-β probes. As shown in Fig. 4A, TAF1-2 altered the mobility of the double-stranded INF-β probe but neither the top nor bottom single-stranded INF-β probes. As expected, mutAT1/2 failed to bind all three probes. Therefore, DNA binding by the TAF1-2 AT-hooks is specific for dsDNA and is not the result of simple electrostatic interaction between a solvent-exposed basic patch and the acidic DNA backbone of single-stranded DNA. To determine the specificity of TAF1-2 for structural features of dsDNA, we performed EMSAs with TAF1-2 and the INF-β probe in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled dsDNA competitors: poly(dG-dC), poly(dA-dT), or poly(dI-dC). Poly(dI-dC) effectively competes with A-T-rich sequences for binding by HMGA, presumably because poly(dI-dC) DNA adopts a structure with a narrow minor groove more similar to poly(dA-dT) than poly(dG-dC) (37Banks G.C. Mohr B. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16536-16544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, poly(dA-dT) and poly(dI-dC) competed with INF-β for binding to TAF1-2 at 4 μg/20 μl, but poly(dG-dC) did not. These observations are consistent with a model in which TAF1-2 AT-hooks recognize the structural characteristics of the minor groove of dsDNA with a preference for the narrow minor groove of A-T-rich DNA. TAF1-2 Binds to the TSS Sequence of Several Promoters—Because TAF1 is a component of TFIID and is expected to make physiologically relevant interactions with core promoter DNA, we assayed the ability of TAF1-2 to bind DNA sequences derived from core promoters of several Drosophila genes. In EMSAs, TAF1-2 protein bound 40-bp probes centered on the Sdic (sperm-specific dynein intermediate chain) TSS, the hsp70 (heat-shock-protein 70bc) TSS, the β2t (β2-tubulin) TSS, and the dj (don juan) TSS, but not the Cdic (cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain) TSS (Fig. 5). Sdic, β2t, and dj are highly expressed in Drosophila testes, whereas Cdic is ubiquitously expressed (39Blumer N. Schreiter K. Hempel L. Santel A. Hollman M. Schafer M.A. Renkawitz-Pohl R. Mech. Dev. 2002; 110: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 40Nurminsky D.I. Nurminskaya M.V. De Aguiar D. Hartl D.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 41Santel A. Kaufmann J. Hyland R. Renkawitz-Pohl R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1439-1446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because TAF1-2 is the most abundant TAF1 isoform in testes, the observation that TAF1-2 can bind core promoter sequence of the testis-specific Sdic, β2t, and dj genes in vitro raises the possibility that TAF1-2 may contribute to the transcriptional activation of these genes in vivo. TAF1-2 Binds DNA That Contains an AAT Sequence—In the HMGA NMR structure, AT-hooks intimately contact the INF-β PRDII sequence AAT (26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 8: 657-665Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). To test whether TAF1-2 also binds AAT, we performed EMSA with TAF1-2 and the INF-β probe or the INF-β mut probe, in which the AAT sequence was changed to AGT (Fig. 5A). This experiment revealed that TAF1-2 weakly bound the INF-β mut probe, suggesting that TAF1-2 AT-hooks directly interact with the AAT sequence (Fig. 5B). The hsp70 TSS probe, to which TAF1-2 strongly bound, contained two AAT sequences (Fig. 5A). Mutation of one of these sequences to AGT, in the hsp70 mut probe, substantially reduced binding by TAF1-2 (Fig. 5B). Attempts to determine a minimal DNA sequence bound by TAF1-2 revealed that binding decreased with the length of the DNA probe, even with probes containing AAT sequences, suggesting that high affinity binding requires additional contacts (data not shown). Taken together these experiments define AAT as a preferred site for binding by TAF1-2 AT-hooks. To further refine our understanding of TAF1 DNA binding specificity, we used DNase I footprinting to identify TAF1-2 interaction sites on the Drosophila Sdic promoter (40Nurminsky D.I. Nurminskaya M.V. De Aguiar D. Hartl D.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed five regions of protection by TAF1-2 on the 265-bp Sdic probe, which is centered at the TSS (Fig. 6). One protected site was located just upstream of the Sdic TSS and within the region predicted to be bound by TFIID. Each of the five protected regions contained >66% A-T bp, and taken together the five regions contained 75% A-T bp. Four of the five protected regions contained the AAT sequence element. These data indicate TAF1-2 AT-hooks bind DNA with a preference for the narrow minor groove of A-T-rich sequences and especially the sequence AAT. This work provides evidence that Drosophila TAF1 directly interacts with DNA through AT-hook motifs. Drosophila appears to be the only organism in which TAF1 contains AT-hooks, which may account for the different DNA binding capabilities of Drosophila relative to mammalian TAF1s (7Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.-L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 8Dehm S.M. Hilton T.L. Wang E.H. Bonham K. Mol. Cell.

Wassarman, unpublished observation. TAF1-2 AT-hooks bound, with variable affinity, TSS sequences from several Drosophila genes and mutation of the initiating A-T bp in the hsp70 TSS probe drastically reduced binding (Fig. 5B). Thus, we speculate that evolutionary accretion of Drosophila TAF1 AT-hooks may have occurred to recognize A-T-rich promoters. Aerts et al. (42Aerts S. Thijs G. Dabrowski M. Moreau Y. De Moor B. BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) found differences in the base composition surrounding TSSs in Drosophila versus vertebrates. Both Drosophila and vertebrates have a greater A-T than G-C content in intergenic regions. But although Drosophila have increased A-T content at the TSS, relative to intergenic regions, vertebrates have a greater G-C than A-T content at the TSS. Furthermore, Drosophila genes can be divided into classes with small and large increases in A-T content at the TSS, which suggests a functional meaning to the A-T content of Drosophila promoters, possibly analogous to CpG islands in vertebrates (43Caiafa P. Zampieri M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Hence, TAF1 may add to a growing list of proteins that have acquired AT-hooks in a particular organism or species to regulate DNA-dependent events through A-T-rich elements (44Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Kondrashov A.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 573-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For example, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the amino terminus of the Orc4p subunit of the origin recognition complex contains nine AT-hook motifs, which bind DNA replication origins that are extremely rich in A-T bp (45Chuang R.-Y. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). AT-hooks in Orc4p and extremely A-T-rich replication origins do not occur in other eukaryotic organisms, including other yeast species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, in plants there are several examples of AT-hook-containing transcription factors that activate transcription through binding A-T-rich enhancer elements (46Christiansen H. Hansen A.C. Vijn I. Pallisgaard N. Larsen K. Yang W.C. Bisseling T. Marcker K.A. Jensen E.O. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 809-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 47Korfhage U. Trezzini G.F. Meier I. Hahlbrock K. Somssich I.E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 695-708PubMed Google Scholar). These observations imply that other species-specific AT-hook proteins regulate DNA-dependent events controlled by A-T-rich elements. This work has also extended our understanding of AT-hook-DNA interactions. TAF1 isoforms that contain one versus two AT-hooks greatly differ in their capacity to bind DNA. Neither TAF1 AT-hook 12 nor 12a has DNA binding activity, but together the AT-hooks bind DNA with low micromolar affinity. This finding highlights the importance of intramolecular cooperativity of AT-hooks for DNA binding, as shown for HMGA family proteins (26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 8: 657-665Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 31Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 34Claus P. Schulze E. Wisniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like HMGA family proteins, TAF1-2 binds the minor groove of A-T-rich dsDNA (26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 8: 657-665Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). DNA binding by TAF1-2 was competed by poly(dA-dT) and poly(dI-dC), which have a similar narrow minor groove, but not poly(dG-dC), and TAF1-2 failed to bind single-stranded DNA (Fig. 4). Thus, although TAF1 and HMGA AT-hooks have different sequences and spacing, they appear to bind DNA in a similar manner. Systematic mutational analysis of the AT-hook region encoded by exon 12a supports the definition of the AT-hook as a 9-amino acid Lys/Arg-rich motif but brings into question the importance of DNA binding of Gly and Pro residues within the Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro core sequence (24Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although 25 of 33 amino acids encoded by exon 12a are conserved among Drosophila species, only the six conserved Lys or Arg amino acids within the predicted AT-hook motif drastically reduced DNA binding (Fig. 3). Similarly, protein hydroxyl radical footprinting analysis of HMGA showed that DBD1, which is identical in sequence to TAF1 AT-hooks, but not surrounding residues contact INF-β DNA (35Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wisniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, residues surrounding DBD2 and DBD3 substantially contribute to DNA binding. Thus, conserved residues surrounding TAF1 AT-hook 12a are likely to serve functions independent of DNA binding. The strong requirement for Lys and Arg residues flanking the Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro core was unexpected given the frequency of Gly and Pro residues at these positions in predicted AT-hook motifs (24Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Also unexpected was the relatively minor requirement for Gly and Pro residues within the Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro core sequence. Proteins containing Ala substitutions at these positions retained substantial DNA binding activity. In the NMR structure of HMGA DBD2 and DBD3 bound to a fragment of the INF-β enhancer, the two AT-hooks made similar contacts with DNA (26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 8: 657-665Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The Arg-Gly-Arg portion of the Arg-Gly-Arg-Pro core sequence formed a concave surface that inserted into the minor groove of A-T tracts, the Pro directed the peptide backbone away from the minor groove, and flanking Arg and Lys residues made extensive hydrophobic and polar contacts with the DNA. Our findings indicate that the methyl side group of Ala, within the sequence Arg-Ala-Arg, is tolerated for interactions with the minor groove and that reorientation of flanking sequences by the Pro residue is not necessary for DNA binding. These data suggest that the AT-hook motif, and more specifically the Gly-Arg-Pro, is more divergent than that described by Aravind and Landsman (24Aravind L. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4413-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In support of this proposal, DNA binding by Lens epithelium-derived growth factor 75 (LEDGF/p75) requires three AT-hooks (AARRGRKRK, SPKRGRPAA, and PKPRGRPKM, where the underlined sequence corresponds to the Gly-Arg-Pro sequence), the first of which contains a Lys instead of a Pro within the putative invariant Gly-Arg-Pro sequence (48Turlure F. Maertens G. Rahman S. Cherepanov P. Engelman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1663-1675Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our searches of the Drosophila data base have identified several proteins with potential AT-hooks that do not contain the Gly-Arg-Pro sequence. 4C. E. Metcalf and D. A. Wassarman, unpublished observation. For example CG2995, which encodes a chromatin-modifying enzyme, contains five potential AT-hooks within a 168-amino acid region (KRGRGRARK, EKKPGRKRK, VKRMRRSVR, PKKRGRKAK, and PKRSKRRIK). Thus, the AT-hook may be a more prevalent DNA-binding motif than previously predicted. As expected based on experiments with other AT-hook proteins, EMSA and footprinting studies revealed that TAF1-2 AT-hooks bind DNA sequences containing A-T tracts (23Solomon M.J. Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat.

The trinucleotide sequence AAT may be a preferred binding site for TAF1-2 because four of the five regions protected by TAF1-2 in the footprinting analysis contained an AAT and mutation of AAT to AGT within the hsp70 TSS or INF-β probes severely reduced binding by TAF1-2 (Figs. 5 and 6). These data are consistent with the prediction, based on NMR analysis of HMGA, that AA(T/A)T is an optimal AT-hook-binding site and other studies showing that AT-hooks binds an A-T tract of 3-5 bp (26Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 8: 657-665Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 49Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In summary, experiments presented here suggest that modulation of the TAF1-DNA interaction, by regulated expression of TAF1 isoforms containing one versus two AT-hooks, contributes to gene-specific transcription. Further characterization of TAF1 should shed light on the relationship between TFIID-promoter affinity and the specificity and efficiency of transcription initiation. Additionally, detailed analysis of the determinants of the TAF1-DNA interaction and comparison with the determinants of the HMGA-DNA interaction suggests the existence of unrecognized AT-hook-containing proteins, elevating the importance of understanding the molecular consequences of AT-hook-DNA interactions in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2128823646,"Vinculin is an important constituent of both cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions, where it plays crucial roles in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration. When activated, it mediates the linkage between cadherins (cell-cell) or integrins (cell-matrix) and the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with various proteins. The activation of vinculin requires structural conversions from an autoinhibited conformation to the “open” conformations in which the occluded binding sites of its different ligands become exposed, while the structural dynamics underlying the vinculin activation remains largely unknown. Here we report the first computational study of large scale conformational dynamics of full-length vinculin. We find that the “holding” and “releasing” motions between vinculin tail and pincer-like structure formed by first three domains of vinculin are the dominant motions near the native state of vinculin, indicating that an inherent flexibility of vinculin has a large influence on its allostery. We also find a cooperative dissociation between the head and tail domains of vinculin with increasing temperature in both thermodynamic and kinetic simulations, implying that vinculin may function as an allosteric switch in response to external signals. We show that the kinetics of vinculin unfolding exhibits specific sequential patterns, suggesting that a sophisticated interplay between domains may synergistically contribute to vinculin activation. We further find that the interaction between vinculin-binding site peptide from talin and vinculin significantly destabilizes the intramolecular head-tail interactions, suggesting a direct role of talin binding in vinculin activation.

Vinculin, a highly conserved 117-kDa intracellular protein (1066 residues), plays critical roles in the maintenance and regulation of cell shape, adhesion, and migration (1DeMali K.A. Barlow C.A.

Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are essential to many physiological and pathological processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing, and metastasis. In its inactive state, vinculin is held in a “closed,” autoinhibited conformation by intramolecular interactions between the head and tail domains (Vt) (6Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 7Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Upon recruitment to cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions, vinculin becomes activated and provides a structural link between the membrane and actin filaments in both locales (8Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), although the exact role of vinculin in the formation of adhesion complexes is unknown. The crystal structure of vinculin is composed of a series of helix bundles that are arranged into five distinct domains (11Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) (D1-D5, Fig. 1). Each of the first three domains (D1-D3) comprises two four-helix bundles that share a central long α-helix, whereas D4 is a single four-helix bundle that is connected to Vt (D5) by a proline-rich linker region (Fig. 1). Domains D1 and D3 form a pincer-like structure holding the vinculin tail in an autoinhibited state (Fig. 1) in which many ligand-binding sites are occluded. Domain D2 stabilizes the pincer-like structure by forming extensive contacts with domain D3. The activation of vinculin requires the release of the interaction between the D1 (residue 1-258) and Vt (residue 896-1066) domains, which is triggered by binding to different ligands. Early biochemical and structural studies established the role of an acidic phospholipid PtdIns(4,5)P 2The abbreviations used are: PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; DMD, discrete molecular dynamics; PDB, Protein Data Bank. 2 in disrupting the interaction between D1 and Vt by binding to Vt domain (12Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 13Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem.

Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The release of the D1-Vt interaction further exposes cryptic binding sites in vinculin for other ligands, including talin, α-actinin, α-catenin, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), vinexin, ponsin, actin-related protein complex (Arp2/3), paxillin, and actin (9Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the role of talin in releasing the head-tail interaction was uncovered more recently (15Izard T. Vonrhein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27667-27678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It was found that the binding of specific short talin peptides (∼30 amino acids) to the D1 domain alone is sufficient for releasing intramolecular head-tail interactions in the D1-Vt complex by provoking significant structural changes of the D1 domain, suggesting an alternative pathway of vinculin activation, in which PtdIns(4,5)P2 may not be required (15Izard T. Vonrhein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27667-27678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, Bakolitsa et al. (11Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and Gilmore and Burridge (12Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) demonstrated that larger fragments of talin bind poorly to fulllength vinculin in vitro. When PtdIns(4,5)P2 is added, binding strength increases 4-fold (12Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Hence it is more likely that the activation of vinculin is achieved by a combinatorial binding of ligands rather than any single ligand (11Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 17Demali K.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 565-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite intensive biophysical and biochemical studies, a global and dynamic picture of vinculin activation is still lacking. Experimental characterization of the large scale conformational dynamics relevant to vinculin activation is challenging. Even using computational methods, the time scale of the conformational dynamics and the size of vinculin are beyond the resolution capabilities of the current all-atom molecular dynamics simulation techniques. Hence, to uncover the large scale conformational dynamics associated with vinculin function, we utilize rapid discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) (18Dokholyan N.V. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Shakhnovich E.I. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 19Rapaport D.C. The Art of Molecular Dynamics Stimulation. 2nd Ed.

We find distinct and complementary roles of internal (inherent flexibility, domain-domain interactions within vinculin) and external (talin binding) factors in allosteric control of vinculin, suggesting possible mechanisms for vinculin activation. Homology Modeling of Missing Loop Structure—The conformation of a loop (856-874) is missing in the x-ray structure of vinculin. We used the biopolymer module of the program SYBYL to reconstruct the backbone conformation of this loop. The reconstruction is based on homology modeling method (21Sanchez R. Sali A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). By searching the structural homologues of this loop in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) (22Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar), we used SYBYL to generate a candidate list of loop structures for reconstruction. From this list as the template for reconstruction we chose the loop structure (PDB accession code: 1KZQ, chain B, residues 191-212) that has the highest sequence identity (26.1%) to the missing loop. We further used SYBYL to integrate the reconstructed loop conformation into the original vinculin structure. We further added side chains to amino acids on the reconstructed backbone. We determined the optimal rotamer states of side chains by a Monte-Carlo minimization procedure (23Ding F. Prutzman K.C. Campbell S.L. Dokholyan N.V. Structure (Camb.). 2006; 14: 5-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein and Interaction Model—We performed DMD simulations using a simplified two-bead protein model, in which each residue was represented by one backbone bead Cα and one side chain bead Cβ (only Cα for Gly). The detailed implementation of covalent bonds and constraints that maintain the geometry of each residue in the model can be found in Ref. 24Ding F. Dokholyan N.V. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Shakhnovich E.I. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3525-3532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar. In addition to the covalent bonds and constraints, we used the Gō potential (25Abe H. Go N. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1013-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Go N. Abe H. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 991-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) to model the non-bonded interactions within monomers. The chicken vinculin crystal structure (11Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) (PDB accession code 1ST6) with reconstructed loop was used as native structure to assign the Gō potential. We also incorporated backbone hydrogen bonding interaction into the simulations (27Ding F. Dokholyan N.V. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Shakhnovich E.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic and Kinetic Simulations—In thermodynamic studies, prior to the equilibrium simulations we performed simulations for 1 × 105 time units from the initial temperature T = 0.1 to various target temperatures in the range between T = 0.1 and T = 2.0 (simulation temperature is in units of ϵ/kB, where ϵ is the energy unit and kB is Boltzmann's constant). We then performed equilibrium simulations for 1 × 106 time units at the corresponding target temperatures. In kinetic studies, we performed 20 unfolding simulations starting from the same native structure of vinculin but different initial velocities. In each kinetic unfolding simulation, we gradually (during 5 × 105 time unit) increased the system temperature from T = 0.1 to T = 0.9. We then analyzed the pattern of dissociations between domains and within domains during the course of unfolding. Fraction of Native Contacts as a Measure of Dissociation Magnitude—A native contact is defined to exist in a given conformation if the Cβ atoms of two residues are within a cutoff distance (7.5 Å) both in this conformation and in the native structure. The cutoff distance used to define the native contact was the same as the one used to define structure-based Gō potential. The fraction of native contacts (Q) was defined as the ratio between the number native contacts in a given conformation and in the native structure. It takes the value ranging from one (when a protein adopts native structure) to zero (when a protein is fully unfolded) and has been used as a reaction coordinate in the study of protein folding (28Onuchic J.N. Nymeyer H. Garcia A.E. Chahine J. Socci N.D. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 87-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Characterization of the Principal Motions Near the Native State—We used essential dynamics to characterize the principal motions near the native state. The essential dynamics (29Amadei A. Linssen A.B. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar, 30Ichiye T. Karplus M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) were based on the diagonalization of the covariance matrix constructed from fluctuations of Cα atoms in the simulation trajectories in which the overall translation and rotation have been removed. M=⟨(Xi-Xi,0)(Xj-Xj,0)⟩(Eq. 1) Xi (Xj) in Equation 1 are the separate x, y, and z coordinates of the ith (jth) Cα atom (i,j = 1... N, N is the total number of Cα atoms) fluctuating around its average Xi,0. The average was taken over all the snapshots along the trajectories used for calculation. We used the trajectory from DMD simulation at low temperature (T = 0.2) where the native state was the most favorable state and protein undergoes conformational fluctuations near native state. The diagonalization of Equation 1 yields a set of eigenvectors (describing directions in the high dimensional configurational space) and eigenvalues (represent the mean square fluctuation of the total displacement along the eigenvectors). The first few eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues describe principal motions. Motions along these eigenvectors are mainly large anharmonic fluctuations and generally can be linked to the biological functions of the proteins. The motions described by eigenvectors with small corresponding eigenvalues represent harmonic (Gaussian) fluctuations, which are thermal fluctuations in nature. Simulation of the Interaction between Vinculin-binding Site Peptide from Talin and Vinculin—To investigate the role of talin binding in vinculin activation, we performed simulations of the binding of vinculin-binding site (VBS1, residue 605-636) from talin to vinculin. We modeled the interaction between vinculin and VBS1 by constructing the following effective potential, Etot=Evinculin-free+EVBS1-free+Einteraction(vinculin-VBS1)=∑i,jΔi,jvinculin-free+∑i,jΔi,jVBS1-free+α∑i,jΔi,jD1-bound+∑i,jΔi,jD1-VBS1(Eq. 2) where {Δi,jvinculin-free} and {Δi,jVBS1-free} are the Gō-like pair-wise contact energies corresponding to the free state of vinculin (11Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C.

Matrices {Δi,jD1-bound} and {Δi,jD1-VBS1} are the Gō-like contact energies of the VBS1-bound state of D1 domain and between D1 domain and VBS1 that are assigned based on the D1-VBS1 complex structure (31Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R. Ziegler W.H. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (PDB accession code 1TO1). The inclusion of contact energies for the VBS1-bound state of D1 domain serves to effectively account for the conformational change of D1 upon VBS1 binding. For units that dissociate from each other, it is important to scale effective energy contribution to reflect the additional translational entropy gained by interacting domains. Parameter α is such scaling coefficient, the range of which is determined by consistency of simulations with experimental observations. More specifically, we determined the range of α by satisfying the following two conditions to be in agreement with experimental observations: first, without VBS1, the native state of the free D1 is the most stable state (root mean square from free D1 and VBS1-bound D1 structure are <2.4 and >3.0 Å, respectively); second, with VBS1, the experimentally determined D1-VBS1 complex is the most stable state at low temperatures (root mean square from complex structure is <2.4 Å). With the determined range of α was between 0.65 and 0.72, we then performed simulations in the presence of both VBS1 and vinculin at various temperatures. The simulation results are not sensitive to the exact value of α within the determined range. To improve the efficiency of simulation, we constrained the distance between Cβ atoms of residue Ala616 of VBS1 peptide and residue Pro15 of D1 domain within 12 Å (these two atoms are within 7.5 in the native D1-Vt complex) so that the VBS1 and vinculin are spatially close to each other. The Principal Motions Near the Native State—The principal motions that dominate conformational fluctuations in the vicinity of the native state of proteins often recapitulate the structural dynamics underlying their biological functions (32Berendsen H.J. Hayward S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To characterize the principal motions near the native state of vinculin, we first performed DMD simulations of vinculin at low temperature, where the native state of the protein is thermodynamically most favorable and the protein mainly undergoes small conformational fluctuations near its native state (see “Materials and Methods”). We then use essential dynamics analysis (29Amadei A. Linssen A.B. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar, 30Ichiye T. Karplus M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”) to find the principal motions of the polypeptide chain. The first dominant mode is characterized by a breathing motion between two elements of vinculin structure (Fig. 1a). One such element consists of the end of the proline-rich linker region (Fig. 1) and the structural region from Vt helix bundle that is spatially proximal to the proline-rich linker region. The other element contains the structural region from D3 that is in spatial proximity to Vt and one of the two helix bundles from D2 that has extensive contacts with D3. The first dominant mode also involves a global twisting motion that occurs between two helix bundles within D2. The second dominant mode is highlighted by a holding and releasing motion between Vt domain and pincer-like structure formed by D1, D2 and D3 (Fig. 1b). The holding and releasing is synergized between the structural region from the Vt that is spatially proximal to D1, the structural region from D3 that is close to Vt and the middle region in the D2 structure (Fig. 1b). The third dominant mode involves the nearly parallel rotation and twisting of D1, D2, and Vt (Fig. 1c), reflecting the flexibility along the orthogonal directions distinct from the first two dominant modes. The interaction interface between D1 and Vt remains rigid in all three dominant modes of principal motions, indicating that the intramolecular interactions between D1 and Vt are kept intact under the conformational fluctuations near the native state. The Thermal “Melting” of Intra- and Interdomain Interactions—To further characterize inter- and intradomain structural plasticities of vinculin that contribute to its function, we studied the thermal melting of inter- and intradomain interactions in vinculin. We performed equilibrium simulations at various system temperatures ranging from T = 0.1 to T = 2.0. At each temperature, we used the fraction of native contacts (see “Materials and Methods”) to quantify the magnitude of dissociations between and within domains. We plotted the fractions of inter- and intradomain native contacts as functions of temperature (Fig. 2). We find that dissociations between most domains (D1-Vt, D3-D4, Vt-D3, D2-D3, Vt-D4, D1-D3) exhibit cooperative changes with increasing temperatures. In contrast, the association between D1 and D2 domain shows a gradual, rather than cooperative, decrease when temperature increases (Fig. 2a). In addition, we found that the associations between Vt and D3 domain were completely lost at the temperatures where the majority of the contacts between other domain pairs are kept, indicating that the effective interaction between the Vt-D3 pair was weaker compared with other pairs (Fig. 2a). Noticeably, the significant dissociations between the tail domain and the “pincer” formed by D1-D3 and between the constituent domains of the pincer occur in the temperature range near the midpoint (T ≈ 0.75) of thermal denaturing curve of the whole vinculin (curve not shown). This observation indicates that the interactions between these domains contribute cooperatively to the stability of the whole vinculin. As temperature increases, the dissociations between domains are followed by the significant unfolding of individual domains, suggesting that the thermal melting of vinculin occurs in a hierarchical manner. We observed a sigmoidal decrease in the fraction of intradomain native contacts (Qintradomain) with increasing temperature (Fig. 2b). For each domain, at low temperatures most native contacts are kept and, thus, the Qintradomain is close to 1 (Qintradomain = 1 in the fully folded state). At high temperatures most native contacts are disrupted, and the Qintradomain is ∼0 (Qintradomain = 0 in the fully unfolded state). The midpoint of each curve is the folding transition temperature of the corresponding domain. We find that Vt domain shows higher stability than other domains, which is indicated by the relatively higher folding transition temperature (Fig. 2b). The remaining domains show different, but comparable, folding transition temperatures. The Kinetics of Vinculin Unfolding—To better understand how external perturbations lead to the sequential disruption of interdomain interactions of vinculin, we performed kinetic unfolding of vinculin by gradually increasing the temperatures in the simulation. We collected and analyzed 20 kinetic unfolding simulation runs starting from the same native structure of vinculin but different initial velocities (see “Materials and Methods”). We found a specific sequential unfolding pattern across different unfolding trajectories (Figs. 3 and 4). Domains Vt and D3 are the first two domains that completely and irreversibly dissociate from each other, which is followed by Vt and D4 dissociation. Next, D1 and D2 dissociate. The native contacts between D1 and D2 were kept at a residual level (Qinterdomain < 0.2) due to oscillatory gain and loss of the local interactions between D1 and D2. Furthermore, a series of cooperative dissociations between domains D1-Vt, D2-D3, and D1-D3 (Fig. 4) occur. The dissociations between these domains occur close to each other in time, although in distinct temporal order in different simulations, suggesting a close interplay between these domains in response to the external perturbation through the unfolding process. Last, a marked decrease of native interactions between D3 and D4 occurs.FIGURE 4A sample trajectory from kinetic unfolding simulations. The fractions of native contacts between domains (a) and within domains (b) are plotted as a function of simulation time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Accompanying the interdomain dissociations, the constituent domains start to unfold. Domains D1, D2, and D4 unfold first, followed by the unfolding of domains D3 and Vt (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the simulation reveals that the Vt domain unfolds via an intermediate state, whereas the unfolding of other domains exhibit apparent two-state behavior. Further structural characterization of the intermediate state of the Vt domain and the data from NMR experiments suggest its role in Vt function. 3R. D. Dixon, Y. Chen, N. V. Dokholyan, and S. L. Campbell, unpublished data. The Role of Talin Binding in Vinculin Activation—The binding of talin to vinculin was postulated as an important mechanism for vinculin activation (15Izard T. Vonrhein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27667-27678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 7228-7236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the binding of talin to vinculin induces a conformational change of D1 domain of vinculin, which disrupts the interaction between D1 and Vt domains (15Izard T. Vonrhein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27667-27678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 7228-7236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, most supporting evidence for this postulate was not obtained in the context of the whole vinculin. To shed light on the role of talin binding in activation of the whole vinculin, we studied the association of the vinculin-binding site (VBS1, residue 605-636) from talin and the full-length vinculin. We modeled the interaction between vinculin and VBS1 by an effective potential based on the crystal structure of D1-VBS1 complex (31Papagrigoriou E. Gingras A.R. Barsukov I.L. Bate N. Fillingham I.J. Patel B. Frank R. Ziegler W.H. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2942-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”). We performed DMD simulation of the binding of this peptide to vinculin at various temperatures. We found that the disruption of D1-Vt interaction occurs in a cooperative manner as was observed for the ligand-free state of vinculin. Interestingly, the temperature at which the D1-Vt interaction is completely disrupted is much lower in the presence of VBS1 (T ≈ 0.70) than the ligand-free state of vinculin (T ≈ 0.76), indicating that the binding of VBS1 peptide to vinculin significantly destabilizes the D1-Vt interaction (Fig. 5 and the legend therein). On the other hand, the binding of VBS1 peptide to vinculin is insufficient to disrupt D1-Vt interaction under native conditions (Fig. 5), suggesting a high free energy barrier between active and inactive state of vinculin in the presence of VBS1 in the simulation. The Influence of Inherent Flexibility on Allostery of Vinculin—The ability to adopt distinct conformations upon the binding of diverse ligands makes vinculin a multifarious allosteric protein. We find that the intrinsic flexibility of vinculin, which is defined in the absence of ligand, has a large influence on the allosteric properties of vinculin. The two most dominant motions characterized in our simulation in the absence of any ligand binding differ in details, but they both involve “opening” and “closing” motions between Vt domain and structural elements of the pincer-like structure formed by D1, D3, and D2. These motions represent the intrinsic tendencies of the transitions between the closed, inactive state and an open state. The observed flexibility of vinculin is mainly determined by its native topology, suggesting that the native topology plays an important role in determining allosteric properties of vinculin. Interestingly, it was found in recent studies (34Tobi D. Bahar I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18908-18913Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) that the conformational changes of proteins upon ligand/protein binding are often well recapitulated by the intrinsic global motions of proteins in the unbounded state. These global motions are predominantly defined by native-contact topology of proteins (34Tobi D. Bahar I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18908-18913Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Hence, although the actual allosteric response is triggered by ligand binding, native topology may to a large extent define the plausible allostery of a protein. The Cooperative Nature of Vinculin Activation Makes It an Allosteric Switch—Despite the observation that the intrinsic plasticities of vinculin largely define the conformational changes associated with vinculin activation, the interaction interface between D1 and Vt remains rigid in all the dominant modes of principal motions near the native state. Therefore, it is the ligand binding that is required for the disruption of D1-Vt interactions and vinculin acitivation. The current model of vinculin activation triggered by ligand binding is mainly based on two complementary lines of evidence. One comes from studies of the interaction between Vt and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (12Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 13Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As suggested in the limited proteolysis experiments (14Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to Vt triggers a pronounced conformational change of Vt that in turn inhibits the D1-Vt interactions and exposes actin-binding and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites in Vt. The other line of evidence comes from more recent studies of the interaction between D1 and talin (15Izard T. Vonrhein C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27667-27678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 35Bass M.D. Smith B.J. Prigent S.A. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the structures of D1 bound to talin peptides show that the first half of D1 converts from a four- to a fivehelix bundle upon binding, with a simultaneous repacking of the hydrophobic core (16Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.J. Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that this “helix bundle conversion” produces a conformation that is incompatible with the D1-Vt interaction interface that can in turn disrupt the D1-Vt interactions. Instead of directly competing for the Vt-binding surface of D1, talin alters the structure of D1. However, several other studies showed that larger fragments of talin bind poorly to full-length vinculin in vitro (11Bakolitsa C. Cohen D.M. Bankston L.A. Bobkov A.A. Cadwell G.W. Jennings L. Critchley D.R. Craig S.W. Liddington R.C. Nature. 2004; 430: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 12Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The addition of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is sufficient to increase the binding strength between talin and D1 4-fold (12Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Hence, the role of talin binding in the activation of full vinculin activation remains controversial (17Demali K.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 565-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We find that the binding of VBS1 peptide from talin to vinculin does significantly destabilize the D1-Vt interaction. Also, the VBS1 binding is insufficient to completely disrupt the D1-Vt interaction under native conditions. The latter observation is not fully consistent with the recent experimental observations that the titration of VBSs from talin disrupts the D1-Vt interaction between the disjoined head and tail fragments of vinculin (complex formed between residues 1-840 and residues 879-1066) at room temperature (33Bois P.R. O'Hara B.P. Nietlispach D. Kirkpatrick J. Izard T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7228-7236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This result speaks to the possibility that our simulation may overestimate the free energy barrier between the active and inactive states of vinculin in the presence of VBS1. We speculate that the main factor leading to this overestimation is that the binding of VBS1 to the D1 domain in vinculin induces intermediate conformational changes stabilized by interactions that are absent in the final native D1-VBS1 structure, while the Gō potential used in our simulation (see “Materials and Methods”) cannot capture those favorable interactions non-existent in the native structure. Therefore, a further characterization of these possible intermediate conformations in the kinetic experiments is of great interest. We also observed a cooperative dissociation of between D1 and Vt in both thermodynamic and kinetic simulations with increasing temperature, suggesting that vinculin activation may not be a stepwise, but rather a cooperative, process. Once the binding of the ligands is able to overcome the activation barrier, vinculin rapidly becomes activated. The cooperative nature of vinculin activation may give rise to the switch-like property of vinculin in integrating the external signals (the specific ligand binding). Recently, two studies pointed out that vinculin may play important regulatory roles rather than merely being a structural link between the actin cytoskeleton and adhesion receptors (1DeMali K.A. Barlow C.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 36Subauste M.C. Pertz O. Adamson E.D. Turner C.E. Junger S. Hahn K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). First, it was found that the recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex to vinculin is required for efficient lamellipodial protrusion (1DeMali K.A. Barlow C.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), suggesting that vinculin might couple cell adhesion and membrane protrusion by localizing actin assembly to sites of newly engaged integrins (1DeMali K.A. Barlow C.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 37DeMali K.A. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2389-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Second, vinculin regulates cell survival and migration by modulating the recruitment of paxillin to focal adhesions (36Subauste M.C. Pertz O. Adamson E.D. Turner C.E. Junger S. Hahn K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Therefore, the switch-like property and the requirement of multiple ligand binding for activation enables vinculin to function as an “AND” logic switch in rapid response to the regulatory signals and exert dynamic control over downstream events. The Synergistic Contribution from Domain-Domain Interactions to Vinculin Activation—The dissociations between Vt and D4 and Vt and D3 domains are two obligatory steps on the route to the disruption of the D1-Vt interaction in kinetic unfolding simulations. This observation suggests that besides the D1-Vt interaction, the direct interactions between Vt and other domains may also be essential in modulating vinculin activation. Consistent with our observation, Cohen et al. (38Cohen D.M. Chen H. Johnson R.P. Choudhury B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17109-17117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) recently provided compelling biochemical evidence that the interactions between Vt and D4 are important in maintaining the autoinhibited state of vinculin. The dissociations between domains D1-Vt and the disassembly of the pincer-like structure (the dissociations between D2-D3 and D1-D3) occur in a cooperative manner (close to each other temporally) despite that the temporal order of the occurrence is not conserved. This observation raises a possibility that these domains may form a rigid cooperative unit, in which the significant dissociation between any pair of domains in this unit may subsequently trigger the dissociations between other domains upon even a slight external perturbation (such as ligand binding and temperature). Hence, we hypothesize that the disruption of D1-Vt interactions may involve a synergistic interplay between other domains. This hypothesis is experimentally testable as it predicts that the mutations weakening the interactions between D2 and D3 and D1 and D3 may effectively destabilize the autoinhibited state of vinculin.

Such conservation of locus structure is generally an indicator of common regulation. Albumin is more specific for liver, because AFP is also expressed in other endodermal tissues of the embryo, but the expression patterns of both genes mirror hepatic development and maturation (5Belayew A.

Albumin expression begins at hepatocyte specification, rises to adult levels by E14, and then persists in mature liver where albumin gene transcripts are the most abundant mRNA. AFP expression initially parallels albumin, although low-level expression activates somewhat earlier than albumin in the foregut. The high level of AFP expression in fetal liver selectively and rapidly silences after birth. Because this silencing reverses in liver cancer, AFP is the prototype oncofetal antigen (2Abelev G.I. Eraiser T.L. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Reactivation of AFP suggests that the tumor cell transcription controls recapitulate those of the fetal hepatocyte. The albumin-AFP locus is an ideal model system for study of long distance enhancer-promoter interactions during developmental regulation. In both genes, promoter-proximal controls mediate developmental regulation while distant enhancers drive high level expression (8Pinkert C.A. Ornitz D.M. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D.

Both enhancers bind multiple C/EBP and Foxa isoforms, and HNF6 (10Liu J.K. DiPersio C.M. Zaret K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 773-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Hu I.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22178-22187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Computer analysis also predicts that these factors bind the AFP gene -4.3-kb (E2) and -2.7-kb (E1) enhancers. 3J. Locker, unpublished results. Thus C/EBP binds all of the enhancers and promoters. In contrast, Foxa predominantly binds the enhancers while HNF1 is confined to promoters. The vast majority of cell lines derived from hepatocellular carcinomas either express AFP or have a null phenotype. The albumin-positive AFP-negative adult hepatocyte phenotype is quite rare in cell lines from all species, except in those derived from the rat Reuber hepatoma. AFP repression is mediated by elements that extend from about -900 to -250 bp (12Vacher J. Tilghman S.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the mouse, an upstream part of this repressing region, the SBE/p53RE (-878 to -762) binds p53, p73, and Smad4 (19Cui R. Nguyen T.T. Taube J.H. Stratton S.A. Feuerman M.H. Barton M.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 2005; 25: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, a less well defined region closer to the promoter mediates most repressive activity in Reuber cells (11Wen P. Groupp E.R. Buzard G. Crawford N. Locker J. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To exploit the phenotype of Reuber hepatoma, cell line H-4-II-E (H4E) was paired with another rat cell line, McA-RH8994 (8994). The latter has a fetal phenotype and expresses high levels of both albumin and AFP. A previous study showed that the genes were intact in both cell lines and characterized the transcripts in detail (21Schulz W.A. Crawford N. Locker J. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 174: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Other articles described transient assays of promoter and enhancer constructs in these cells (11Wen P. Groupp E.R. Buzard G. Crawford N. Locker J. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Li C. Locker J. Wan Y.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and we also characterized the relevant transcription factors (below). 3J. Locker, unpublished results. This resource of cell lines and characterizations is the basis of a model system of enhancer and promoter function. The new experiments demonstrated that the albumin promoter and enhancer were active in both cell lines, while the AFP promoter and proximal enhancer were active in 8994 but repressed in H4E cells. However, transcription factor binding was detected in both the active and silenced AFP gene. Although transcription factor binding patterns were gene-specific, we detected promoter-specific factors on enhancers, where binding sites for these factors had not been demonstrated. The clarification of these observations led us to rule out the presence of binding sites in detected regions and investigate the relationship of chromatin fragmentation to localized detection by immunoprecipitation. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—We used the Boyd and Farnham procedure (23Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) as described in Forsberg et al. (24Forsberg E.C. Downs K.M. Bresnick E.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 334-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Solutions and sample volumes were according to the latter article. Fixed chromatin was sheared in capped Falcon 2059 tubes tubes, in a Branson 450 Sonifier equipped with an S-450 cup horn filled with water and refrigerated at 4 °C. Tubes were placed in the cup horn and sonicated from 4-8 min as 30-s pulses, using Power Setting 70%, Duty Cycle 25%. DNA was extracted from an aliquot, solubilized with proteinase K overnight, and resolved on an agarose gel. The DNA from these aliquots showed a broad distribution of molecular weight, and a preparation was considered suitable for further analysis if the maximum intensity was in a range of 400-800 bp. Such preparations generally gave successful ChIP assays, but with batch-to-batch differences in sensitivity of detection. We subsequently found that sonication varied with the number of tubes and position in the cup horn and added the following modifications. In the modified procedure, a single tube was suspended by a clamp in the center of the cup horn, 1 mm above the base. Sonication for 6 min was used for a standard assay, and other sonication times were studied for their differential effects on detection by ChIP. Each preparation of formalin-fixed chromatin from 8994 was obtained from 2 × 107 exponentially growing cells while H4E chromatin was prepared from 3 × 107 cells in the same solution volumes. In a typical experiment, a preparation was divided into 5 separate immunoprecipitations. The final isolated DNA was redissolved in 30 μl. PCR amplifications were individually optimized and run for 30-40 cycles in various experiments. All illustrated reactions were amplified for 40 cycles to accentuate weak or to substantiate negative detections. A typical 20-μl PCR reaction contained 1 μl of isolated DNA, i.e. the input from 1.7 × 105 8994 cells or 2.6 × 105 H4E cells. Primers were designed to span 300-400 base pair regions. For quantitative real-time PCR, 384-well plates were prepared with final reaction volumes of 8 μl, including 4 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), primers at 0.25 μm, and sample or control DNA. Amplification and detection were carried out using an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system and data were analyzed using software provided with the system. All measured values were averaged from three separate reactions. A standard curve was obtained using normal rat DNA with 10-fold dilutions from 100 ng/μl (∼30,000 gene copies) to 10 pg/μl (∼3 gene copies). Experimental values were interpolated from the standard curve. Primers for this analysis were designed to amplify segments of 80-120 bp and are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1PCR primers and amplimersRegionPositionaPosition relative to the main transcription start site of each gene.PrimersbThe first primer pair listed was used for conventional PCR, and the second pair for real-time PCR.Alb P−315 to −7CTTCCCTGCAAACTGAAATGCCCGTTGACAGGAAAGGTGGTCTGTGTG−115 to −6GTAGGAACCAATGAAATGAAAGGGGTTGACAGGAAAGGTGGTCTAlb E−9820 to −9482CAGTTTTCCACCTGACCCCGCGTTAAGTAGTGTCACCTCATGCTCAACG−9688 to −9588CACACGTCTCTAGGCACTACGACGTTGCTCGGTGTTAGGCAlb C−880 to −517TGCAGGACTTGTATACCTTCCTGAAGATGGTGTGGAGGACTCTCAGAAGTCTTGTGTAlb C1−587 to −380CACCTCAGACCCGTTTCACACATAGCCTTCCTCACACGAAGTCTTCACGGAFP P−280 to 101ATTGGAAGAGTTTAGTTGGCGGAGAAAAGCATCTTACCTATTCCAAACTCATTTGTG−118 to −13ATGTTTGCCCACTGAAGGTTGCCCAGACAGTGGTAGAAGCAFP E1−2702 to −2407TGAATAGTCGGGGGTAGAGCCTTTAAGGTGCACAGGGTCACCGT−2474 to −2370ATAACCCGGAGGCAAAATTCTGGGGAGATCTTTGCAATTCAFP E2−4332 to −4024CTGGCACACACACGATTAGCATCTTCAGGGCTTAGTGTAGGTGTGTGGGAGAFP E3−6282 to −5882GTTCGGCGGGCAGCTCGTTGACTGTGTGGACCAGCTTAFP C−1350 to −1042ATTTCCCTTGCAATCTAGAAAGAGCTGAGTCATCTGCATAGCCTGTGIns P−362 to −35ACAAAGATACCAGGTCCCCAACAACAAAGCACCTCCTCTCTGCCCC−115 to −35CTCGCCATCTGCCTACCTACAAAGCACCTCCTCTCTGCCBglo P−207 to 5GGACAGCGTTTTCTTCAGAGGGAGTAGAAGCAAATGTGAGGAGCGACTGAT−81 to 1CCAATCTGCTCACACAGGACACAAATGTGAGGAGCGACTGATa Position relative to the main transcription start site of each gene.b The first primer pair listed was used for conventional PCR, and the second pair for real-time PCR. Open table in a new tab For sequential immunoprecipitation, a protocol was modified from Hatzis and Talianidis (25Hatzis P. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1467-1477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). 2 × 107 cells were treated as above, but divided into two larger primary immunoprecipitations, each from about 1 × 107 cells. All volumes were proportionally enlarged. Following capture of immunoprecipitates by Protein A or G, the beads were suspended in 40 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol for 37 °C for 30 min, in a solution also containing 26 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 3.6 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.8% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS. The samples were transferred to room temperature. 1 ml of fresh iodoacetamide buffer was added (10 mm iodoacetamide, 26 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 3.6 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.8% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) and the sample was equilibrated at room temperature for 10 min. The suspension was then divided into 5 separate tubes for secondary immunoprecipitations, each from 2 × 106 cells. These were then treated by the standard immunoprecipitation protocol. Suitability of antibodies varied greatly. Those considered suitable showed a clear positive detection when secondary precipitation was carried out with the same antibody as the primary precipitation (i.e. primary epitopes were preserved), and no detection when precipitation was carried out without a secondary antibody (i.e. complete liberation from the primary antibody). The Nkx2.8 antibody was characterized in Ref. 26Kajiyama Y. Tian J. Locker J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6122-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar and the other antibodies specificities were: HNF1α (sc-6547), HNF1β (sc-7411), C/EBPβ (sc-150), FTF/BIF1 (sc-5998), Foxa1 (sc-6553), Foxa2 (sc-9187), Foxa3 (sc-5360), HNF6 (sc-6559), TBP (sc-204), Pol II N terminus (sc-899), HDAC1 (sc-7872), HDAC2 (sc-7899), SMRT (sc-1612), MeCP2 (sc-5758), Brg1 (sc-8149), PCAF (sc-6300), Src1 (sc-6096), CBP (sc-7300), HP1 (sc-10217), CAF1 p60 (sc-10979), Histone 1 (sc-8030), SIRT1 (sc-15404) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); NF-Y A (556359) from BD-Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); and acetylated histone 4 (06-598), and monomethyl Histone 3 (K9) (07-395) from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Gel Shift and Competition Assays—The nuclear extract and standard gel shift assay conditions were described in Ref. 27Wen P. Locker J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6616-6626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and the modified extract and gel shift for Nkx2.8 were described in Ref. 26Kajiyama Y. Tian J. Locker J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6122-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. For modified competition analysis, 10-μl assays contained 0.4 ng of labeled double-stranded DNA binding sites, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 12-30 μg of nuclear extract protein (or 1.2 μg of partially purified Foxa protein, in a fraction eluted from heparin-Sepharose at 700 mm NaCl) and a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor. For the PCR-amplified competing segments, this resulted in final DNA concentrations of 30-40 μg/ml. These amplimers were purified from acrylamide gels. The binding site double-stranded oligonucleotides had four base protruding single-stranded ends for fill in labeling with Klenow Pol I. The binding site oligonucleotide top strands were: albumin promoter sites HNF1 (tcgaTGTGGTTAATGATCTACATTA) and NF-Y (tcgaGGGTAGGAACCAATGAAATGAAAGGTTAGT), (16Vorachek W.R. Steppan C.M. Lima M.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6122-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); and a site that binds Foxa/HNF6 from AFP E3 (tcgaAGTGTACCTTTATGACTTTGACATA (18Groupp E.R. Crawford N. Locker J. J.

Interactions in the Promoter Regions—Analysis of the albumin and AFP promoters confirmed promoter binding of specific factors and established relationships of gene activity to local chromatin structure. We used a standardized qualitative ChIP protocol (26Kajiyama Y. Tian J. Locker J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6122-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), amplimers that fully encompassed the conserved regulatory regions, and antibodies to binding factors present in H4E and 8994 cells (Fig. 1). HNF1α, HNF1β, and C/EBPβ were detected on both promoters, while Foxa isoforms and HNF6 were detected on neither. C/EBPα, a liver-enriched transcription factor, is absent from H4E and most other hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, 3J. Locker, unpublished results. so this antibody was not included in the study. NF-Y selectively bound the albumin promoter, while FTF and Nkx2.8 selectively bound the AFP promoter. Nkx2.8 was absent in H4E cells, where it is not expressed, and was the only transcription factor that showed a cell-specific difference in any part of this study. All of the cis-binding factors showed the expected promoter localizations, which confirmed previous studies in other cell types as well as the specificity of the ChIP analyses. Analysis of coregulators and histone modification demonstrated that the albumin promoter was active in both cell lines, while the AFP promoter was active only in 8994 cells. Activity was indicated by the presence of coactivators (BRG1, PCAF, SRC1, and CBP), and acetylated H4. In contrast, the AFP promoter in H4E cells showed H3 monomethylation but not acetylation, and a complete switch from coactivators to corepressors (HDAC1, HDAC2, and SMRT). These differences indicated active repression of the AFP promoter in the H4E cells, which was highly consistent with the known developmental regulation. Even so, active repression was surprising, because the known binding factors were all activators and their binding appeared to be unperturbed. Studies to elucidate repressing factors that bind the AFP promoter are underway, but outside the scope of the present article. As additional markers of gene activity, we included TBP and Pol II in the ChIP analysis. The detections of these two preinitiation complex proteins showed characteristic differences between the two cell lines. TBP detections were weaker and pol II detections were stronger in H4E than in 8994 cells, differences that presumably reflect the growth and transcriptional dynamics of each cell line. However, both TBP and pol II were strongly detected on the repressed AFP promoter. Similar associations have been demonstrated in genes repressed by the Polycomb complex (29Breiling A. Turner B.M. Bianchi M.E. Orlando V. Nature. 2001; 412: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30Dellino G.I. Schwartz Y.B. Farkas G. McCabe D. Elgin S.C. Pirrotta V. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 887-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Distant Regulators and Quantitative ChIP—Promoter region analysis was extended to the entire locus; a 70-kb region containing the rat albumin and AFP genes was cloned, sequenced, analyzed for repetitive DNA regions, and aligned with human sequences (Fig. 2A). The region was analyzed by both qualitative and quantitative PCR, with an enlarged panel of antibodies (Fig. 2, B and C). PCR detections were devised for all regulatory elements characterized in the rat (9Godbout R. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Wen P. Groupp E.R. Buzard G. Crawford N. Locker J. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Each analyzed region showed some positive detections, confirming that local chromatin structure was accessible to antibodies. As internal gene controls, we also examined neutral DNA segments (designated Alb C and AFP C in Fig. 2) with the following properties: intermediate position between promoters and enhancers, absence of function in deletion mapping studies, minimal conservation with the human, and absence of repetitive DNA. For controls external to the locus, we studied two genes unexpressed in 8994 and H4E cells. Insulin 1 has a close developmental relationship, because normal expression is in pancreas, a tissue that arises from foregut endoderm like liver. Moreover, the insulin-1 promoter proximal region had been shown to bind HNF1, C/EBP and NF-Y (31Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). β-Globin major, in contrast, is expressed only in cells that are developmentally distant from liver. Altogether, ten gene regions were analyzed qualitatively in both cell lines. Six of these regions were also characterized with quantitative PCR. Five additional immunoprecipitations enlarged the characterization of negative regulation, by detecting factors associated with inactive chromatin, repression, or heterochromatin: H1 (32Wolffe A.P. Essays Biochem. 2001; 37: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); the p60 subunit of CAF1 (33Tchenio T. Casella J.F. Heidmann T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1953-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); HP1 (34Young A.P. Longmore G.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 814-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); SIRT1 (35Senawong T. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Shepherd D.M. Frye R.A. Minucci S. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43041-43050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); and MeCP2 (36Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). The albumin gene showed essentially the same patterns of binding and histone modification in both cell lines. DNA binding transcription factors and coactivators were present on the promoter and enhancer, but not the neutral region between them. All three regions were positive for acetylated histone and basal transcription factors, and there was no detection of corepressors, negative chromatin factors, or methylated histone. The AFP gene was active in 8994 but repressed in H4E, and this difference was reflected over a wide region that extended from the AFP promoter to E2. Like the albumin gene, the active AFP gene showed basal factors and acetylated histone over the neutral region (AFP C) between the promoter and enhancers, but not coactivators or transcription factors. In repression, however, ChIP of AFP C detected corepressors and two other silencing factors, MeCP2 and H1. Thus, coactivators were more localized around the promoter and enhancers during active gene expression than corepressors and negative chromatin factors during repression. The AFP enhancers, especially E2 and E3, revealed additional complexities. In H4E cells, AFP E1 and E2 bound transcription factors, but also bound corepressors and heterochromatin factors. In contrast, E3 appeared active by these analyses. In 8994 cells, E1, but not E2 or E3, bound transcription factors. All three enhancers nevertheless bound coactivators and had acetylated histone in these cells. Significantly, the presence of transcription factors on the endogenous genes, but not activated or repressed chromatin, correlated with the function of the enhancers on transfected plasmids, because all three AFP enhancers were active in H4E cells when transfected in combination with other promoters (11Wen P. Groupp E.R. Buzard G. Crawford N. Locker J. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Conversely, only AFP E1, but not E2 or E3, was active in 8994-cell transfections (22Li C. Locker J. Wan Y.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Basal transcription factors TBP and Pol II were not confined to the promoters but were instead detected at almost all targets in the locus regardless of transcriptional activity or histone acetylation. The localization appeared to be specific, because these basal factors were absent from the inactive insulin and β-globin promoters. This demonstration is consistent with recent studies of the β-globin LCR, in which Pol II (with transcripts) was detected over a wide region upstream of the ϵ-globin gene (37Kim A. Dean A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7028-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 demonstrates the consistency between the qualitative and quantitative PCR. Moreover, the positive quantifications, which varied over about three orders of magnitude, confirmed that even the lowest levels of detection represented hundreds of gene copies and were significantly different from the negatives. Promoter Factors Bind to Enhancers—The detection of some DNA-binding factors on enhancers was unexpected. Foxa/HNF6 and C/EBP binding were predicted, but four factors thought to be promoter specific were also detected. Moreover, the enhancer detections selectively reflected the corresponding promoters (Fig. 2, B and C). The albumin enhancer bound HNF1 and NF-Y. AFP E1 bound HNF1, FTF, and Nkx2.8. Binding sites for these four promoter-specific factors were not detected in previous studies of the enhancers nor predicted by extensive motif analysis (16Vorachek W.R. Steppan C.M. Lima M. Black H. Bhattacharya R. Wen P. Kajiyama Y. Locker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29031-29041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Kajiyama Y. Tian J. Locker J. Mol. Cell.

We noted variation in these PCR detections from one experiment to another, but data displayed in Fig. 2 were confirmed in multiple experiments that had internally consistent controls. Because no site-specific DNA binding factors were detected on intermediate segments, the detection of these factors suggested enhancer-promoter looping. Looping would have been further substantiated by detection of enhancer-specific factors on promoters, but such binding by Foxa/HNF6 was not detected. Nevertheless, the detection of four different transfactors on enhancers that did not have obvious binding sites for those factors led to a further analysis of binding sites and to a more rigorous approach to chromatin fragmentation (below). A regional compe"
https://openalex.org/W2116761028,"Deletions within the dystrophin gene (DMD) account for >70% of mutations leading to Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD and BMD). Deletion breakpoints were reported to be scattered within regions that also represent meiotic recombination hot spots. Recent studies indicates that deletion junctions arise from nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), a major pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in mammals. Here we show that a region in intron 47 (i.e., a major deletion hot spot in the DMD gene) generates DSBs during meiosis in yeast and harbors a cluster of previously sequenced deletion breaks. Mapping of breakpoints in 26 BMD/DMD patients indicated that the frequency of breakpoint occurrence around this region is 3-fold higher than expected by chance. These findings suggest that DSBs mediate deletion formation in intron 47 and possibly account for the high frequency of meiotic recombination in the region. Statistical analysis indicated the presence of at least one other breakpoint cluster in intron 47. Taken together, these results suggest that the primary events in deletion formation occur within discrete regions and that the scattered breakpoint distribution reflects both a variable degree of DSB end processing and the availability of a small (compared to the huge regions involved) deletion junction sample."

Although there are examples of reversible heart failure in man, our understanding of how the myocardium repairs itself is limited. A well defined animal model of reversible heart failure would allow us to better investigate these restorative processes. Receptors that activate Gαq, a signal transduction molecule in the heterotrimeric G protein superfamily, are thought to play a key role in the development of heart failure. We demonstrated previously that mice expressing a recombinant Gαq protein, the activity of which can be turned on or off at will in cardiac myocytes, develop a dilated cardiomyopathy with generalized edema and heart failure following activation of the protein (Fan, G., Jiang, Y.-P., Lu, Z., Martin, D.

Here we report that the contractile dysfunction and pathological structural changes in the myocardium improved significantly after termination of the Gαq signal, even in animals with overt heart failure. Abnormalities in two proteins that regulate Ca2+ handling in myocytes, phospholamban and the voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channel, were also reversed, as was the increased expression of genes that are associated with heart failure. These results indicate that the heart has a substantial reparative capacity if the molecular signals responsible for the myocardial dysfunction can be identified and blocked.

Following cardiac injury, activation of Gαq-coupled receptors in the heart exerts deleterious effects that promote the development of heart failure.

Fusing a mutant hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (hbER) 2The abbreviations used are: hbER, hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor; QL, GαqQ209L-hbER; PLB, phospholamban; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; LTCC, L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel; MHC, myosin heavy chain; BNP, natriuretic peptide precursor type B; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: hbER, hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor; QL, GαqQ209L-hbER; PLB, phospholamban; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; SERCA, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; LTCC, L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel; MHC, myosin heavy chain; BNP, natriuretic peptide precursor type B; WT, wild type. to the carboxyl terminus of constitutively active GαqQ209L renders this Gαq protein inactive (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, the GαqQ209L-hbER (QL) protein becomes active. This inducible model allowed us to investigate the consequences of Gαq activation in myocytes after completion of normal development and growth. We found that tamoxifen activation of the QL protein in adult transgenic mice causes a dilated cardiomyopathy that leads to heart failure (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J.

Heart failure is often associated with depressed cardiac contractility, which is also exhibited by the QL mice (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Contractility of cardiac myocytes is regulated by changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Ca2+ enters the cell through the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (LTCC) and induces a large release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through the ryanodine receptor, resulting in myocyte contraction. Relaxation is caused by removal of Ca2+ either by the SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) or the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger located at the plasma membrane. SERCA is regulated by phospholamban (PLB), which inhibits SERCA when dephosphorylated and thus decreases Ca2+ uptake into the SR. In the absence of compensatory responses, decreased LTCC function would reduce Ca2+ entry, leading to decreased myocyte contractility. Dephosphorylation of PLB leading to inhibition of SERCA would deplete SR Ca2+ stores and also lead to a decrease in myocyte contractility. Both LTCC function and PLB phosphorylation are decreased in the QL hearts, which may explain why these animals develop heart failure (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another advantage of this inducible model is that it allowed us to terminate the Gαq signal and determine whether any of the cardiac abnormalities are reversible. In this study, we found that even after the QL mice developed signs of overt heart failure, many of the cardiac defects returned to normal once the Gαq signal was turned off. Materials—Antibodies for phospho-Ser16 PLB and PLB were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). SERCA-2 antibody was from ABR (Golden, CO). Tamoxifen was from Sigma. GαqQ209L-hbER Transgenic Mice—C57BL/6 mice expressing QL under the control of an α myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter were described previously (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J.

Measurement of cardiac hemodynamics, PLB phosphorylation, percent extracellular space, gene expression, and whole-cell patch clamping of isolated cardiac myocytes were performed as described previously (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All animal-related experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Statistical Analysis—Paired Student's t test was used to compare groups, and significance is defined as p < 0.05. Values represent means ± S.E. Reversible Heart Failure in QL Mice—In our previous study of QL transgenic mice, we found that many of the male mice developed generalized edema indicative of heart failure following tamoxifen injection to activate the Gαq protein (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because this phenotype can be easily monitored by weighing the animals, we used a 20% increase in body weight as the criterion to identify mice with overt heart failure. Starting at 8 weeks of age, male QL mice and wild type (WT) littermates were weighed and injected daily with 1 mg of tamoxifen for up to 28 days. Fifty percent (36/71) of the QL mice met the weight gain criterion within this time span. These mice were designated as QL (Tam), and their paired WT controls were designated as WT (Tam). Thirty-six percent (26/71) of the QL mice died without attaining a 20% weight gain. The paired QL (Tam) and WT (Tam) animals were randomly assigned to two groups. In the first group, the animals were analyzed immediately. In the second group, we stopped the tamoxifen injections and continued to monitor their body weight for the next 14 days to determine whether heart function improved upon termination of the Gαq signal. None of the WT mice died during the experimental period, and none of the QL (Tam) mice died after the tamoxifen injections were stopped. Mice at the end of this 14-day recovery period were designated as QL (Rev) and WT (Rev). Fig. 1A shows the change in body weight of a representative pair of QL (Rev) and WT (Rev) animals throughout the experimental period. As expected, the WT mouse gained weight gradually over the first 23 days. In contrast, the QL mouse began to gain weight rapidly after 14 days of tamoxifen injection. This was associated with a decrease in physical activity and an edematous appearance as described previously (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At day 23, the QL mouse had gained more than 20% of its initial body weight, and the injections were stopped in both mice (Fig. 1A, arrow). Over the next 14 days, the body weight of the WT mouse changed relatively little. In contrast, the QL mouse lost weight rapidly (Fig. 1A), and the edematous appearance resolved. Fig. 1B summarizes the changes in body weight for multiple QL (Rev) and WT (Rev) mouse pairs. The elevated average body weight gain of the QL mice at the time when the tamoxifen injections were stopped significantly reversed 14 days later (Fig. 1B). The final average weight gain in QL mice after the 14-day recovery period was statistically indistinguishable from that of the WT mice (∼7%) (Fig. 1B). We previously used invasive hemodynamic measurements to demonstrate the presence of heart failure in QL mice injected with tamoxifen (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The same technique was used to confirm that cardiac function improved in QL (Rev) mice. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was elevated, and dP/dt values were altered in the edematous QL (Tam) animals as compared with the WT (Tam) controls (Table 1), indicating compromised contractile function. All of the hemodynamic parameters were significantly improved in the QL (Rev) mice as compared with the QL (Tam) group (Table 1). As we reported previously (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the cardiomyopathy in QL (Tam) mice is associated with cardiac dilatation and chamber enlargement (Fig. 2A), an increased heart weight/tibia length ratio (Fig. 2B), and increased extracellular space between myocytes (Fig. 2, C and D). These morphological and histological changes were much improved in the QL (Rev) mice (Fig. 2). However, the percent extracellular space in the QL (Rev) animals was still elevated as compared with WT (Rev) mice (Fig. 2D). It is not known whether a recovery period longer than 14 days would allow a complete reversal of this phenotype. Relatively rapid reversal of these morphological changes supports our previous observation that heart failure in the QL mice is probably not associated with myocyte loss (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Hemodynamic measurements in QL and WT miceParameterWT (Tam)WT (Rev)QL (Tam)QL (Rev)HR (beats/min)395 ± 21428 ± 24320 ± 33442 ± 28aSignificantly different from QL (Tam).LVESP (mm Hg)98 ± 499 ± 381 ± 5106 ± 7aSignificantly different from QL (Tam).LVEDP (mm Hg)0.6 ± 1.20.1 ± 0.710.8 ± 3.7−1.4 ± 0.5aSignificantly different from QL (Tam).Max dP/dt (mm Hg/s)9230 ± 74010432 ± 9104167 ± 61011588 ± 1060aSignificantly different from QL (Tam).Min dP/dt (mm Hg/s)−6450 ± 427−6990 ± 210−3426 ± 440−8333 ± 647aSignificantly different from QL (Tam).a Significantly different from QL (Tam). Open table in a new tab Unlike QL mice, in which the cardiac pathologies were reversed when the Gαq signal was turned off, overexpression of GαqQ209L in myocytes of conventional transgenic mice induces cardiac dilatation that progresses to heart failure even after the initiating signal is lost (2Mende U. Kagen A. Cohen A. Aramburu J. Schoen F.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13893-13898Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The level of exogenous GαqQ209L protein in the ventricles drops dramatically between 2 and 4 weeks of age, and by 10 weeks it is undetectable. These mice die of heart failure between 8 and 30 weeks of age (2Mende U. Kagen A. Cohen A. Aramburu J. Schoen F.J. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13893-13898Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This result is somewhat surprising because the structural changes in our QL mice reverted to near base line when the Gαq signal was turned off (Fig. 2). One possible explanation for this difference in phenotype is that activation of Gαq during development but not during adulthood irreversibly alters the myocardium in a deleterious manner. Reversible Molecular Changes in QL Hearts—Heart failure is associated with increased expression of genes such as natriuretic peptide precursor type B (BNP) and βMHC. In humans, an increased level of circulating BNP is used as a diagnostic indicator of heart failure. As reported earlier (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), heart failure in the QL mouse is also associated with an increased expression of BNP and βMHC mRNAs and decreased expression of αMHC mRNA (Fig. 3A). More importantly, in the QL (Rev) hearts the amount of BNP and βMHC mRNA decreased, and the amount of αMHC mRNA increased nearly to WT (Rev) levels (Fig. 3A). All of the changes between the QL (Tam) and QL (Rev) groups are statistically significant. Heart failure in the QL mice is associated with functional changes in two major regulators of Ca2+ homeostasis in myocytes: SERCA-2 and the LTCC (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To assess the reversibility of these Ca2+ handling defects, we first measured the phosphorylation state of PLB in heart membranes prepared from QL and WT mice. Phosphorylation of PLB on Ser16 prevents it from binding to and inhibiting SERCA-2. PLB underwent almost complete dephosphorylation in QL (Tam) animals (Fig. 3B). However, phosphorylation was essentially completely restored in the QL (Rev) hearts to the level seen in WT (Rev) hearts. The total amount of PLB and SERCA-2 was not noticeably different in the four groups (Fig. 3B). Finally, we investigated whether the decreased LTCC function exhibited by QL (Tam) mice is also reversible. Whole-cell patch clamping was used to measure inward Ca2+ current (ICa,L) density as an assessment of LTCC function as described previously (3Lu Z. Jiang Y.P. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40347-40354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). First, the peak ICa,L density at +10 mV was calculated. The depressed ICa,L density seen in myocytes from QL (Tam) mice was significantly increased in QL (Rev) cells (Fig. 3C). Peak ICa,L density in QL (Rev) myocytes was 74% of that in WT (Rev) myocytes. We next constructed current-voltage relationships for the four groups of myocytes. ICa,L density in QL (Rev) cells was significantly increased compared with that measured in QL (Tam) myocytes over the entire range of activation (greater than -30 mV) (Fig. 3D). Although some forms of heart failure in humans are reversible, including myocardial dysfunction because of sepsis (4Parker M.M. Shelhamer J.H. Bacharach S.L. Green M.V. Natanson C. Frederick T.M. Damske B.A. Parrillo J.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1984; 100: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), myocarditis, transient ischemia (5Hollenberg S.M. Parrillo J.E. J. Heart Lung Transplant. 1997; 16: S7-S12PubMed Google Scholar), and takotsubo cardiomyopathy (6Akashi Y.J. Nakazawa K. Sakakibara M. Miyake F. Koike H. Sasaka K. QJM. 2003; 96: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), the presence of structural changes with ventricular dilatation is considered to be a poor prognostic factor. However, recent studies in end-stage heart failure patients treated with left ventricular assist devices have shown that mechanical unloading improves myocyte function and reverses structural remodeling of the failing heart (7Dipla K. Mattiello J.A. Jeevanandam V. Houser S.R. Margulies K.B. Circulation. 1998; 97: 2316-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 8Zafeiridis A. Jeevanandam V. Houser S.R. Margulies K.B. Circulation. 1998; 98: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This therapy also normalizes Ca2+ transients and increases SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake. Results from the present study are consistent with these findings in humans, and they further indicate that the structural and electrical remodeling of even a severely damaged heart is potentially reversible. However, one must be cautious when extrapolating results using rodent models of heart failure to the human condition because there are important species differences in cardiac physiology. Our model differs from the type of heart failure that progresses through a hypertrophic stage caused by hypertension. However, experiments in sheep suggest that recovery is also possible in a failing hypertrophic heart. Moorjani et al. (9Moorjani N. Catarino P. El-Sayed R. Al-Ahmed S. Meyer B. Al-Mohanna F. Westaby S. Eur. J. Cardiothorac. Surg. 2003; 24: 920-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) showed that after relief of pressure stress in an aortic banding model, both cardiac remodeling and contractile function improve. The relatively rapid onset and recovery from heart failure in this unique animal model will allow additional studies to delineate the sequence of molecular events that are necessary and sufficient to cause these cardiac changes. For example, our previous study indicated that changes in Ca2+ homeostasis occur prior to structural remodeling of the heart (1Fan G. Jiang Y.-P. Lu Z. Martin D.W. Kelly D.J. Zuckerman J.M. Ballou L.M. Cohen I.S. Lin R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40337-40346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether normalization of electrical and other molecular changes precedes the structural recovery of the heart. These mice may also be used to ask whether stable epigenetic or posttranslational changes in the myocytes occur at some point during disease progression to lead to an irreparable failure. Lastly, this animal model will also allow us to investigate how age, exercise, and diet affect the onset and recovery from heart failure. It is our hope that these investigations will lead to an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to heart failure and to the discovery of strategies that will stop or reverse this pathological process."
