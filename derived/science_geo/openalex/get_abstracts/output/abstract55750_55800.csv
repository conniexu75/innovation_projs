https://openalex.org/W1807081515,"Abstract About one-third of the nondeacylatable phospholipids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been shown to be a group of sphingolipids with a single phosphoinositol moiety. This group of lipids was obtained richly concentrated in high yield by several simple steps involving differential solubility. Four components of this group were further purified by liquid chromatography on base-treated porous silica beads. The major component of this group proved to be the novel substance, inositol phosphorylceramide, the ceramide consisting of hydroxysphinganine and a hydroxy C-26 fatty acid. Two other inositol phosphorylceramides were purified which differed from the major component in their ceramide moieties. Two glycolipids are minor members of this group of monoinositol-containing sphingolipids and one of these was purified, and had a composition consistent with its formulation as a mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide. The major inositol phosphorylceramide could be cleaved quantitatively by alkali to give an inositol monophosphate and could be cleaved by periodate to give a C-15 fragment. Periodate treatment followed by borohydride reduction and HCl hydrolysis gave a significant yield of phosphoserinol. These facts suggest strongly that the phosphoinositol moiety is attached to position 1 of the hydroxysphinganine. Data obtained with cells uniformly labeled with [3H]-inositol suggest that all significant ( g 1% lipid 3H) inositol-containing lipids in yeast have now been chemically characterized."

Inoculation of the vagina and cervix with herpes simplex virus type 2, as well as type 1, also induced a latent ganglionic infection. With the use of sciatic nerve section as a stimulus, a reproducible model of viral reactivation in vivo was established."
https://openalex.org/W1589239098,"Abstract Soybean lipoxygenase, long an anomaly among oxygenases because it was reputed to possess no prosthetic groups or metals, has now been shown to contain approximately 1 atom of iron per molecule. This relationship has been shown to be true for three pure isoenzymes, lipoxygenases 1, 2, and 3. The iron can be readily removed by a strong Fe2+ chelator, such as o-phenanthroline, but only after the enzyme has been treated with a reducing agent. The appearance of the o-phenanthroline-Fe2+ complex is matched by the loss of enzyme activity. The metal is believed to exist in the ferric state in the enzyme since it is removed by the specific Fe3+ chelator, Tiron (4,5-dihydroxy-m-benzenedisulfonic acid). However, the removal of the metal is slow, unless the enzyme is denatured. All of the isoenzymes exhibit structure-less optical absorption spectra, detectable at 700 nm, and increasing continuously toward the blue."

https://openalex.org/W1509752586,"Abstract Rat kidney contains two distinct glutaminase isoenzymes; one of which is phosphate-dependent, the other is phosphate-independent but is strongly activated by maleate. The phosphate-dependent glutaminase is contained within mitochondria. Its activity cofractionates with mitochondrial marker activities during differential centrifugation and on sucrose gradients using both isopycnic and sedimentation velocity techniques. Incubation of mitochondria with borate buffer results in increased phosphate-dependent glutaminase, cytochrome oxidase, and malate dehydrogenase activities, indicating that this glutaminase activity may be latent. Submitochondrial fractionation by digitonin-Lubrol treatment in the presence of borate indicated that this glutaminase isoenzyme is contained in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This conclusion was confirmed by a swell-shrink, sonication procedure carried out in the absence of borate. Only 25 to 35 % of the phosphate-independent glutaminase was associated with the mitochondrial fraction obtained by differential centrifugation; the remaining activity was pelleted by subsequent centrifugation at 40,000 x g for 30 min (heavy microsomes). The phosphate-independent glutaminase in both fractions banded during isopycnic centrifugation with a mean density (1.166) similar to that of light mitochondria. However, the results of sedimentation velocity centrifugation studies showed that this isoenzyme was contained in an organelle distinct from mitochondria. The phosphate-independent glutaminase did not fractionate with marker activities for lysosomes, microsomes, or plasma membranes during differential centrifugation or isopycnic gradient analysis and may be contained in some as yet unidentified organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1521493375,"Abstract Two nucleic acid-dependent nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolases have been found in vaccinia virus cores. Both enzymes hydrolyze ATP to ADP and Pi in the presence of nucleic acid. The enzymes were solubilized from purified viral cores by treatment with sulfhydryl-reducing agent, salt, and sodium deoxycholate in a Tris buffer at alkaline pH. DNA-free viral extracts were prepared by adsorption of viral DNA to DEAE-cellulose columns in the presence of high salt, and the two enzymes were purified by DNA-cellulose chromatography. Phosphohydrolase I was purified 300- to 400-fold with yields of 80 to 90 % and is approximately 95 % pure. A molecular weight of approximately 61,000 was calculated for the native enzyme using Sephadex gel chromatography and sucrose gradient sedimentation. A molecular weight value of 68,000 was obtained under denaturing conditions of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that phosphohydrolase I is a monomeric enzyme. The smaller amount of phosphohydrolase II prevented accurate determinations of specific activity or purity. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was calculated to be 68,000 and it may also consist of a single polypeptide. Nucleic acids were required by phosphohydrolase I and II for the hydrolysis of ATP, and optimal activities were obtained at neutral pH in the presence of divalent cations. The hydrolysis of ATP resulted in the production of stoichiometric amounts of ADP and Pi. The Km values of phosphohydrolases I and II were 1.4 x 10-4 m and 6.4 x 10-4 m, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1540136730,"A method for the preparation of highly purified β-hexosaminidase isozymes A and B from human placenta is presented. The purified enzymes possess identical molecular weight and exhibit similar kinetic parameters with artificial fluorogenic substrates. Both enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of Tay-Sachs ganglioside (Cer-Glc-Gal(NeuAc)-GalNAc) and the corresponding asialo-derivative (Cer-Glc-Gal-GalNAc). Both enzymes are composed of four subunits with a mass of 33,000 daltons each. The enzymes seem to differ only in the interactions of these subunits to form the fully associated enzyme by hydrophobic association and the formation of disulfide bonds. It is possible to convert hexosaminidase A into hexosaminidase B by heating under carefully controlled conditions. The newly formed B has the ion exchange properties and subunit interactions characteristic of highly purified hexosaminidase B isolated from fresh tissue. This conversion does not depend on the removal of N-acetylneuraminic acid. Thus, the two hexosaminidases seem to exist as conformers of each other. A model for the relationship of hexosaminidases in normal tissues and in the various clinical conditions which are characterized by the absence of one or more of these enzymes (Tay-Sachs disease and its variant forms) is presented. A benign form of hexosaminidase A deficiency is postulated based on the ability of both A and B to catalyze the hydrolysis of Tay-Sachs ganglioside."
https://openalex.org/W1502975051,"Abstract Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a hypothalamic tripeptide with the structure l-pyroglutamyl-l-histidyl-l-prolinamide. TRH stimulates prolactin and decreases growth hormone production by GH3 cells, a clonal strain of rat pituitary cells grown in culture. TRH binds to specific receptors on GH3 cells. The activities of 26 analogs of TRH have been measured with the GH3 cell system. Both biological activity (prolactin stimulation and growth hormone depression) and affinity for the TRH receptor have been determined for each peptide. The biological activities of the analogs varied over more than a 10,000-fold range. Biological potency correlated with affinity for the TRH receptor for each peptide. The maximum activity of each active analog was the same as that of TRH. The effects of TRH and TRH analogs on prolactin and growth hormone appeared to involve binding to the same receptor. The TRH receptor on GH3 cells is highly selective, particularly for the COOH-terminal prolinamide of TRH. The prolactin-stimulating activities of analogs closely parallel their thyrotropin-releasing activities, suggesting that the TRH receptors on lactotrophs and thyrotrophs are similar or identical."
https://openalex.org/W2072353936,"The potential role of angiotensin II and its heptapeptide metabolite, des-aspartyl-angiotensin II, was studied in the conscious unanesthetized rat. Aldosterone release was induced by both peptides at physiologic doses (0.72 nanogram per minute). [1-Sarcosyl-8-alanyl]-angiotensin II (P-113 inhibited angiotensin II more effectively than des-aspartyl-angiotensin II (101 percent as compared to 82 percent). These results indicate that angiotensin controls aldosterone release in the rat and that des-aspartyl-angiotensin II (that is, angiotensin III) may be important in this sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1595996679,"Abstract Chick embryo fibroblasts infected with the temperaturesensitive mutant of the Rous sarcoma virus, Ts-68, are morphologically transformed when cultured at 37° but retain their fusiform morphology when cultured at 41°. Accompanying the temperature-dependent cell shape changes are alterations in the rate of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake. Ts-68-infected fibroblasts cultured at 37° have a 2.5- to 4-fold higher rate of sugar uptake than fibroblasts cultured at 41°. When Ts-68-infected fibroblasts cultured at 41° are shifted to 37° or vice versa, the greatest change in the rate of sugar uptake occurs in the first 6 hours following the temperature shift. The initial rates of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake and intracellular phosphorylation in Ts-68-infected fibroblasts depended upon the culture temperature. However, no differences were found in the initial rates of phosphorylation in homogenates prepared from infected cells cultured at 41 and 37°. Experiments with cytochalasin B, a sugar transport inhibitor, showed that inhibition of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake was always paralleled by an equal inhibition of 2-deoxy-d-glucose phosphorylation. These data indicated that transport was rate-limiting in 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake at early time points, and alterations in transport were responsible for the alterations in sugar uptake in Ts-68-infected chick embryo fibroblasts. Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to calculate the kinetic constants for 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose transport in Ts-68-infected cells cultured at 41 and 37°. The Km remained constant at approximately 2 or 5 mm at both temperatures for 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 3-O-methyl-d-glucose, respectively, but the Vmax was more than 2-fold greater for cells cultured at 37° (17 and 40 nmoles per mg of protein per min for Ts-68-infected cells cultured at 41 and 37°, respectively). Determination of the kinetic constants in Ts-68-infected cells following a 6-hour shift in culture temperature from 41 to 37° or 37° to 41° revealed that only the Vmax for 2-deoxy-d-glucose transport was changed. The similar values calculated for activation energy, 17.9 and 17.5 Cal per mole, for the 2-deoxy-d-glucose transport reaction in Ts-68-infected cells at 41 and 37°, respectively, is consistent with the interpretation that the increased Vmax in cells cultured at 37° was the result of an increase in the number of transport sites."
https://openalex.org/W1531829990,"Abstract A simple model for the kinetics of adenylate cyclase activated by hormones or fluoride ion was developed. It was then tested on data, published by Birnbaumer et al. ((1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 3468–3476) for rat fat cell ghosts and data, reported by Drummond et al. ((1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 4166–4173) for membrane preparations of guinea pig ventricles. The model yields a satisfactory first approximation of the data. It was concluded that hormones as well as fluoride ion decrease the sensitivity of the enzyme toward inhibition by ATP not complexed to magnesium, thereby favoring the formation of the productive Michaelis complex. Parallel to this the maximal velocity is increased. In contrast to earlier interpretations, no evidence was found for a regulatory binding site for magnesium. Adenylate cyclase activated by hormones was found to be described as a system in equilibrium or in a steady state. Thus, it could be regarded as an allosteric enzyme system with hormones as heterotropic activators."
https://openalex.org/W1637922151,"Abstract The two purified nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolases from vaccinia virus are distinct enzymes as judged by their nucleotide substrate and polynucleotide cofactor specificities. Phosphohydrolase I hydrolyzes only ATP and dATP, whereas phosphohydrolase II hydrolyzes the four common ribonucleoside triphosphates as well as dATP and TTP. The range of Km values for ATP and dATP hydrolysis by phosphohydrolase I (1.5 to 1.6 x 10-4 m) was lower than the range of Km values for ATP, dATP, TTP, GTP, CTP, and UTP hydrolysis by phosphohydrolase II (6.4 to 11.2 x 10-4 m). Phosphohydrolase I had little or no detectable activity in the absence of added nucleic acids. Phosphohydrolase II frequently had some endogenous activity, probably due to trace amounts of nucleic acid present in the eluate from the DNA-cellulose column. This endogenous activity could be reduced by passage through a DEAE-cellulose column. Neither phosphohydrolase I nor II was stimulated by completely double-stranded DNA unless the DNA was first denatured. Only phosphohydrolase II was stimulated by RNA but again only single-stranded forms were usable. Phosphohydrolase II was also stimulated by all tested homopolynucleotides of either the ribose or deoxyribose series and by all possible hybrid forms. Phosphohydrolase I exhibited a greater specificity and was incapable of using single-stranded homopolynucleotides. However, homopolydeoxyribonucleotide duplexes and some homopolyribonucleotide: homopolydeoxyribonucleotide duplexes were effective. These results suggest that phosphohydrolase I requires some secondary structure such as adjacent single-stranded and hydrogen-bonded regions. This interpretation was supported by the preferential inhibition of phosphohydrolase I with actinomycin D and low concentrations of proflavine. The ability of both enzymes to form stable complexes with nucleic acids was shown by glycerol gradient sedimentation. It was concluded that both nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolases have unique properties which make them distinct from any previously described enzymes. Their biological role is unknown, although it is tempting to speculate an involvement in replication and packing of DNA or transcription and extrusion of nascent RNA from viral cores."
https://openalex.org/W1555784209,"Abstract 1. Intact WI-38 human diploid lung fibroblasts were shown to respond to epinephrine (3 x 10-7 m) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) (0.57 x 10-7 m) with increased cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels. Corticotropin (1.25 units per ml), insulin (0.02 to 200 milliunits per ml), and glucagon (5 x 10-7 m) were ineffective. Although the response to PGE1 was not clearly maximal at concentrations up to 2.8 x 10-5 m, the response to 5.7 x 10-6 m PGE1 was greater than the maximal response to epinephrine (10 x 10-6 m) under all conditions studied. 2. Theophylline (2 mm) potentiated the action of PGE1 on cyclic AMP levels by at least 2-fold in all experiments, but was less effective with epinephrine; in several experiments theophylline did not potentiate the effects of the catecholamine. 3. Propranolol (0.1 mm) completely inhibited the effect of epinephrine but only slightly diminished that of PGE1. 4. Cells grown to high population density responded poorly or not at all to epinephrine while cells at low population densities responded very well. A converse relationship was observed between PGE1 action and population density, although it was not as dramatic. The effect of population density on the epinephrine stimulation did not appear to be due to a difference in sensitivity of the populations to epinephrine. 5. Cyclic AMP appeared in the incubation medium of WI-38 cells treated with epinephrine or PGE1. This appearance reached maximal levels more slowly than did intracellular cyclic AMP but represented a considerable amount of cyclic nucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1597663270,"Abstract The isolated cell membranes from bovine corpora lutea bound 125I-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) with high affinity and specificity. The specific binding was saturable with respect to the amounts of membrane protein and 125I-HCG added. Approximately 8.4 x 10-10 m 125I-HCG saturated all the receptor sites in 1.0 mg of membrane protein. The specific binding of 125I-HCG was strong and not readily reversible in nature. The binding of 125I-HCG was inhibited in the presence of unlabeled HCG or luteinizing hormone (LH) in a dose-dependent manner. Prostaglandin E1, which mimicked LH in the stimulation of bovine corpus luteum adenylate cyclase and steroidogenesis, had no affinity for HCG-LH binding sites. The rate constants for association and dissociation, 5.9 x 106 m-1 s-1 and 1.1 x 10-3 s-1 were measured at 38°. The dis sociation constant, 1.9 x 10-10 m, was compared with the value of 1.2 x 10-10 m which was obtained from equilibrium data at 38°. Similar values for the dissociation constants (1.9 x 10-10 m at 38° versus 2.4 x 10-10 m at 22°) were obtained from the rate data at 38° and 22°. The free energy change for the dissociation of 125I-HCG from the receptor complex was calculated to be +14.1 Cal per mole. Maximum specific binding of 125I-HCG occurred at pH 6.2 from 30–38° in contrast to the maximum for nonspecific binding at pH 4.0. Brief exposure of the membranes (15 min) to temperatures of 50–90° resulted in irreversible losses of 125I-HCG binding. Various divalent and monovalent cations in concentrations of 10-1 m or higher markedly decreased binding. Estradiol-17β and progesterone either in combination or alone (10-9 m to 10-5 m) had no effect on 125I-HCG binding. Among several nucleotides tested, only 1 to 2 mm ATP, AMP, adenosine cyclic 3' : 5'-monophosphate, CTP, and guanosine cyclic 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cGMP) have significantly inhibited 125I-HCG binding; CTP and cGMP being most effective. These nucleotides also increased the dissociation of bound hormone when added at various times during incubation. Incubation of membranes with proteolytic enzymes resulted in a marked loss of 125I-HCG binding. Neuraminidases had either no effect or increased the binding by 20%. Phospholipase A and C markedly decreased 125I-HCG binding. In an attempt to restore the loss of 125I-HCG binding following phospholipase C treatment, phosphatidylserine seemed to be most effective. Treatment of the membranes with several protein modifying reagents suggested that tyrosyl residues but not sulfhydryl groups were involved in the binding interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1583158315,"Abstract The binding of manganese by ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase is dependent upon the level of bicarbonate in solution. Saturating levels of bicarbonate (50 mm) create one tight Mn2+-binding site (Kd = 10 µm) per 70,000 dalton subunit of the enzyme. The dissociation constant of the enzyme-Mn2+ complex becomes 64-fold smaller when the bicarbonate level of the solution is raised from l0.5 mm to 50 mm. Binding of Mn2+ to the tight enzyme site (in the presence of saturating bicarbonate) causes a 20-fold enhancement of the effect of Mn2+ on the longitudinal relaxation rate (1/T1) of water. The enhancement due to enzyme-bound Mn2+ at low levels of bicarbonate is only 14-fold. Titration of an enzyme-Mn2+ solution with bicarbonate yields a dissociation constant (7 mm) which is in reasonable agreement with the reported Km values (7 to 25 mm). The enhancement of enzyme-Mn2+ complexes (at varying levels of bicarbonate) can be completely abolished by the addition of carboxyribitol diphosphate, an analog of the presumed carboxylated intermediate of the reaction. A tight complex results in which there is little access of water protons to the enzymebound Mn2+. Observation of a time-dependent decrease in 1/T1 of water protons upon addition of carboxyribitol diphosphate and nonclassical titration curves suggests a conformation change in the enzyme. 13C nuclear magnetic resonance of bicarbonate shows that the effect of enzyme-bound Mn2+ on 1/T1 of carbon is enhanced more than 3-fold over the nonenzyme control, suggesting that the enzyme-bound Mn2+ is very close to the bound bicarbonate. From 1/T1 measurements of the carbon atom of bicarbonate and a correlation time estimated from water proton relaxation rates in the same complex, a Mn2+-carbon distance of 5.4 A is calculated. This value is too great for bicarbonate to be in the inner coordination sphere of Mn2+, but is consistent with a second sphere complex. Carboxyribitol diphosphate abolishes all effects of Mn2+ on the 13C-relaxation rates, consistent with the displacement of HCO3- from the active site of the enzyme. The NMR data are consistent with an active quaternary enzyme-manganese-d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate-CO2 complex with d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate in the inner sphere and CO2 in the second sphere of enzyme-bound Mn2+. The temperature dependence of the transverse relaxation rate yields an exchange rate for bicarbonate from the environment of enzyme-bound Mn2+ of 3 x 104 s-1 and an energy of activation, Ea = 7.3 Cal per mole."
https://openalex.org/W1603516481,"An electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) which couples the oxidation of NADH to the reduction of butyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase has been purified in large quantities from the anaerobic bacterium Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. The purified protein appears to be homogeneous on the basis of polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, thin layer isoelectric focusing, sedimentation velocity, and the Sephadex G-100 elution profile. Preliminary evidence suggests that ETF is also found in a complex with another flavoprotein. ETF has a molecular weight of 72,000 to 75,000 by Sephadex G-100 chromatography and is a dimer of two nonidentical subunits of approximate molecular weights of 33,000 and 41,000 determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis. Based on amino acid analyses, there are 2 moles of FAD per mole of protein of molecular weight 75,600. Possibly each subunit is associated with 1 FAD. The protein-bound FAD is 2.4 times more fluorescent than free FAD. Both tyrosine and tryptophan contribute to the protein fluorescence of ETF. Although the major prosthetic group of ETF is FAD, the isolated protein contains variable amounts of 6-hydroxy-7,8-dimethyl-10-(ribityl-5′-ADP)-isoalloxazine and 7-methyl-8-hydroxy-10-(ribityl-5′-ADP)-isoalloxazine. The isolated protein binds 30% more FAD to give enhanced activity and marked changes in the absorption spectrum. The spectrum of the oxidized isolated ETF is also drastically changed when the protein is maintained for long periods in its reduced form before subsequent reoxidation. In both cases, the major change is a large increase in the absorption around 400 nm. Apo-ETF has been prepared by treatment of the native protein with guanidine HCl. Catalytic activity is restored to the apoprotein by addition of FAD but not FMN. The reconstituted ETF also has increased absorption around 400 nm and decreased absorption at 450 nm compared to the isolated ETF. Unlike many other flavoprotein dehydrogenases which stabilize the neutral, blue flavin semiquinone and do not react with sulfite, ETF stabilizes the red, anionic semiquinone and also reacts with sulfite. Anaerobic titration of ETF with NADH or sodium dithionite resulted in a 2-electron reduction per protein-bound FAD, indicating that there are no colorless oxidation-reduction active groups present."

The nucleolar proteins soluble in 0.4 n H2SO4 were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and autoradiography. Of the 97 proteins visualized by staining, phosphorylation was detected in approximately 40 proteins by autoradiography and by scintillation counting of spots cut from the gels. Several high molecular weight protein spots designated C23, C24, C26, and C27 incorporated as much as 500 times more 32P per spot as some low molecular weight spots. Analysis for phosphoamino acids in 30 spots cut out of the gel slab indicated that radioactive phosphoserine was present in all the spots analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W105701013,"Abstract The interactions of Mn2+, inorganic phosphate, and methylphosphonate with membrane-bound sodium plus potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase from sheep kidney medulla have been examined by kinetic and magnetic resonance techniques. Electron paramagnetic resonance and water proton relaxation rate studies show that the enzyme, which is 35 to 40 % pure, binds Mn2+ at one tight binding site (Kd = 0.88 µm). Kinetic studies yield an activator constant for Mn2+ of 0.88 µm, identifying the one tight Mn2+-binding site as the active site of the adenosine triphosphatase. Competition studies indicate that Mg2+ binds at this site with a dissociation constant of 1 mm in agreement with its activator constant. Inorganic phosphate and methylphosphonate bind to the enzyme-Mn2+ complex with similar, extremely high affinities and decrease the enhancement, e*, by 26 and 24 %, respectively. Analysis of the frequency dependence of 1/T1 of water indicates that this change in enhancement is due to a decrease from 4 to 3 in the number of rapidly exchanging water protons in the coordination sphere of enzyme-bound Mn2+. The relative effectiveness of Na+ and K+ in facilitating ternary complex formation with Pi was examined as a function of pH. The fraction of the total de-enhancement produced by Pi in the presence of Na+ alone varies from 88 % at pH 6.1 to 7.5 % at pH 7.5 and closely follows the titration curve for the second ionization of Pi. Analogous behavior at a higher pH was observed for methylphosphonate, which has a pKa for its second ionization which is 0.9 pH unit higher than that of Pi. These results indicate that Na+ induces the phosphate monoanion to coordinate to the enzyme-bound Mn2+, while K+ causes the phosphate dianion to coordinate to the enzyme-bound Mn2+. Thus protonation of an enzyme-bound phosphoryl group would convert a K+-binding site to a Na+-binding site. Dissociation constants for K+ and Na+ estimated from our nuclear magnetic resonance titrations agreed with kinetically determined activator constants of these ions consistent with binding to the active site. A mechanism is proposed for the ATPase and cation transport in which the ionization state of phosphate at a single enzyme active site controls the binding and transport of Na+ or K+. This model also accounts for the order of magnitude weaker binding of Na+ compared to K+, as well as for all the observed effects of ATP on the enzyme. The Mn2+-binding studies also indicate a large number of additional Mn2+ binding sites, 60 intermediate sites and 170 to 290 weak binding sites depending on the ionic strength. Increased ionic strength exposes an additional 120 weak sites and reduces the affinity of Mn2+ for all classes of sites. The number and affinity of the intermediate and weak Mn2+ sites, which do not activate the enzyme but may be inhibitory, are consistent with coordination to the lipid phosphoryl groups in the preparation."

Differential and sucrose density centrifugation techniques demonstrated a mitochondrial localization for phosphate-dependent glutaminase. Fractionation of isolated mitochondria by digitonin and by sonication revealed a matrix localization for phosphate-dependent glutaminase, a finding in agreement with its demonstrable latency. The highest specific activity of phosphate-independent glutaminase was found in the microsomal fraction. This fraction was also enriched in 5'-nucleotidase (plasma membrane marker) and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase (endoplasmic reticulum marker)."
https://openalex.org/W1596509698,"Abstract A DNA-directed cell-free system to study the l-arabinose BAD operon has been further developed so that the rate of synthesis of enzymes coded for by the structural genes in the operon in vitro is about 5% the in vivo rate. l-Arabinose isomerase and l-ribulokinase, the products of the araA and araB genes, are synthesized at the same rate, demonstrating that the operon is coordinately expressed in vitro. The system is completely dependent upon araC protein which can be supplied either by synthesis in vitro from an araC+ DNA template or by the addition of araC protein extracted from whole cells. The properties in the in vitro system of araC protein from either source suggests that the two products are similar if not identical. Both the repressor and activator forms of the araC protein are demonstrable in vitro using the appropriate templates confirming the essential aspects of the model for gene regulation of this operon."
https://openalex.org/W1507018611,"Abstract A number of chloromethyl ketone protease inhibitors reversibly inhibit β-galactosidase induction, growth, RNA synthesis, and protein synthesis in Escherichia coli at concentrations (0.1 to 1.0 mm) which are not toxic to the cells. The competitive protease inhibitor pentamidine isothionate inhibits β-galactosidase induction at a concentration (0.01 mm) which has little effect on general macromolecular synthesis. The action of chloromethyl ketone compounds is specifically blocked by reduced glutathione. Neither oxidized glutathione, Cleland's reagent, cysteine, nor mercaptoethanol were able to replace glutathione. Although there is a structural similarity between chloromethyl ketones and iodoacetamide, our studies indicate that chloromethyl ketones do not act as general sulfhydryl inhibitors. While tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone can react with glutathione under neutral or alkaline conditions it does not inactivate RNase, as does iodoacetamide. Furthermore, glutathione was able to reverse the inhibition caused by tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone even when added 15 min after inhibition has been established. Glutathione is not able to reverse the inhibition caused by iodoacetamide. In E. coli, the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis by chloromethyl ketones may be the result of reactions with intracellular glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W1521589293,"Abstract The kinetics of the reduction of soluble ferricytochrome c by the membrane-bound succinate-cytochrome c reductase system on fragments of inner mitochondrial membrane has been studied spectrophotometrically for comparison with the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by the membrane-bound oxidase. The time course of the reduction is composed of a part proceeding at constant rate (zero order part), where the rate-limiting step is somewhere on the substrate side of cytochrome c1, then a part where the reaction is first order in ferricytochrome c. During the latter part the reaction with soluble ferricytochrome c is rate-limiting. As previously observed with the oxidase (Smith, L., and Conrad, H. (1956) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 63, 403) the first order rate constant varies with the total concentration of cytochrome c in the reaction mixture. However the properties of the first order reductase reaction differ considerably from those of the first order oxidase reaction, implicating reaction of the reductase with different groups on cytochrome c."

https://openalex.org/W1771164131,"Neurospora crassa strains labeled uniformly with ^(32)P_i and [^3H]inositol exhibit at least six phospholipid components containing ^3H when separated by paper chromatography. One of the major components is phosphatidylinositol. Other components, which account for 40 to 60% of the lipid-extractable ^3H in various strains, are stable to mild alkaline methanolysis and appear to be sphingolipids with equivalent amounts of inositol and phosphorus. The major phosphosphingolipid was purified by means of differential solubility and by column chromatography on porous silica beads. This substance contains equivalent amounts of hydroxysphinganine and hydroxytetracosanoic acid and 2 eq each of myoinositol, phosphorus, and sodium. Alkaline degradation yielded 2 eq of inositol monophosphate and periodate degradation gave a C-15 fragment. The elemental composition of this compound also fits the formulation, (inositol-P)_2-ceramide.
A [^3H]inositol pulse-chase experiment carried out with an inositol-requiring mutant in exponential growth shows labeled inositol accumulating in the sphingolipid accompanied by decreased labeling in phosphatidylinositol and the acid-soluble fraction. These changes also occur when the chase is carried out during inositol starvation suggesting that degradation of phosphatidylinositol and formation of sphingolipid occurs in the absence of growth.
A neutral glycosphingolipid was also obtained as a by-product of the phospholipid purification. This substance is provisionally formulated as the ceramide tetrahexoside: [(gal)_3glu]-N-hydroxytetracosonyl-hydroxysphinganine."

https://openalex.org/W1484578594,"Abstract 1. Well coupled mitochondria isolated from six hepatomas differing widely in growth rate and degree of differentiation were found to exhibit little or no 2,4-dinitrophenol-stimulated ATPase activity in sharp contrast to normal liver mitochondria. Well coupled mitochondria from L1210 and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells were also found to have markedly reduced uncoupler-stimulated ATPase activity when compared with normal liver mitochondria. 2. When intact mitochondria from one of the hepatomas (7800) were studied in greater detail, it was found that normal uncoupler-dependent ATPase activity could not be demonstrated under a variety of conditions. These included (a) the use of uncouplers more potent than 2,4-dinitrophenol; (b) alteration of osmotic and ionic conditions; (c) variation of temperature between 20 and 40°; (d) variation of pH between 6.9 and 9.5; and (e) inclusion of either defatted bovine albumin or oxidizable substrate in the assay medium. 3. Neither forward nor reverse energy-dependent reactions in hepatoma 7800 mitochondria are altered, nor is their sensitivity to uncoupling agents. In the forward direction, hepatoma mitochondria were found to exhibit normal acceptor control and P:O ratios sensitive to uncouplers, and to exhibit uncoupler-stimulated respiration. In the reverse direction, the ATP-Pi exchange rate was found to be the same in hepatoma 7800 and control liver mitochondria and inhibited almost completely in both cases by 2,4-dinitrophenol. In addition, the capacity for ATP-supported Ca2+ accumulation was similar for hepatoma 7800 and control liver mitochondria. 4. Unlike hepatoma mitochondria, mitochondria isolated from regenerating liver 24, 48, and 72 hours after partial hepatectomy exhibit normal levels of uncoupler-stimulated ATPase activity. 5. These results are interpreted most simply by assuming that hepatoma mitochondria, and perhaps mitochondria from L1210 and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, contain two principal sites of action for uncoupling agents, one of which may become expressed during the normal to neoplastic transition."
https://openalex.org/W1585983580,"Abstract Upon irradiation with ultraviolet light radioactivity from labeled cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate was incorporated into high affinity macromolecular receptors in extracts of testis and adrenal cortex. The bond formed was stable in both 10 % trichloroacetic acid and 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate, and is consequently thought to be covalent. This incorporation was linearly proportional to the amount of cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate bound by these extracts. Several proteins lacking the ability to bind the cyclic nucleotide did not incorporate significant radioactivity upon irradiation. Incorporation was inhibited by unlabeled cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate and by analogues which compete for its binding sites. Radioactivity from tritiated cyclic guanosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate was similarly incorporated into testicular extracts upon irradiation. These observations indicate that covalent labeling of receptors for cyclic nucleotides can be accomplished by ultraviolet irradiation in the presence of the unmodified ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1679962349,"Abstract 1. EPR spectra of cobalt-copper bovine superoxide dismutase at liquid nitrogen and liquid helium temperature show that the two metal centers are magnetically coupled. The temperature dependence of the spectra indicates that this coupling arises from an exchange interaction. 2. The EPR spectrum of the Co(II) of the enzyme can only be seen after reduction of the Cu(II), at very low temperature. It is typical of tetrahedral coordination which is distorted in a particular way. The EPR parameters are g⊥ ≃ 4, g|| ≃ 2, D = 11.5 cm-1. No feature indicating interaction between the two Co(II) centers is observed. 3. Anions such as CN- and N3- do not affect the EPR spectrum of Co(II) significantly, but only modify the spectrum of Cu(II). It is concluded that the Co(II) site (and presumably the native Zn(II) site) can be described as distorted tetrahedral, strongly spin-coupled to the Cu(II) and therefore very near to it, and noninteracting with the other Co(II) site and with solvent molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1563336724,"Abstract Some of the factors responsible for the control of pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis in intact cells have been investigated using rat hepatoma cells grown in continuous culture. The addition of uridine (0.5 mm) to culture medium causes a decrease of approximately 70% in the rate of de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, as determined by incorporation of 14CO2. Maximum inhibition of 14CO2 incorporation into pyrimidine nucleotides occurs within 60 min of addition of the uridine. After the uridine has been removed, the rate of 14CO2 incorporation recovers to normal levels with 8 hours. This recovery can be prevented by the addition of actinomycin D or cycloheximide to the medium. Uridine causes a decrease of approximately 70% in the level of activity of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase; it does not significantly affect the activity of carbamyl-P synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase, orotidine decarboxylase, or uridine kinase when these enzyme activities are measured in cell extracts. The decreased level of activity of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase is not due to a direct effect of uridine on the enzyme. The inhibition can be reversed by removal of uridine from the culture medium, but only if transcription and translation are not interfered with by the addition of actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Measurement of enzymes of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway (except for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) under optimal conditions suggests that orotate phosphoribosyltransferase is rate-limiting in the biosynthesis of uridylic acid. The parallel effects of addition and removal of uridine on 14CO2 incorporation into pyrimidine nucleotides and on orotate phospho-ribosyltransferase activity support this suggestion."

https://openalex.org/W1492178041,"Abstract Glycerol dehydrogenase from Aerobacter aerogenes has been partially purified. Kinetic constants for the substrates are reported and an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism based on product inhibition studies is presented. An investigation of the kinetics of monovalent cation activation shows that substrate affinities, particularly those for glycerol and dihydroxyacetone, are affected by monovalent cations, but that the kinetic mechanism remains unaffected. Specifically, at pH 7.5, the affinity for NAD was not affected when assayed in 0.1 m NH4Cl instead of 0.1 m (CH3CH2)4NCl; the affinity for NADH was increased 2-fold. More striking was the 22-fold decrease in the Km value for glycerol and the 25-fold decrease in the Km value for dihydroxyacetone. The maximum velocity in 0.1 m NH4Cl was nearly 3 times that in 0.1 m (CH3CH2)4NCl with all other conditions identical. The relative activating efficiency of the various cations as measured by the resultant maximum velocity, NH4+ g Tl+ g K+ g Rb+, is the same for both oxidation and reduction and is independent of pH. In contrast, the affinities for the monovalent cation were dependent on pH. When the pH varied from 6.1 to 7.5 to 9.0, the affinity for NH4+ and T1+ decreased whereas the affinity for K+ and Rb+ increased. The requirement for a monovalent cation was not eliminated by a proton."

Ethidium bromide was found to mimic virus transformation with regard to the alteration of the glycopeptide patterns observed upon Sephadex G-50 chromatography. Elution profiles of glycopeptides obtained from virus-transformed cells demonstrated the existence of both a normal component (Peak B) and an enrichment of material eluting as a higher molecular weight component (Peak A). Material eluting in the Peak A region is greatly enhanced in both the control and virus-transformed cells after treatment with ethidium bromide. This alteration of the glycopeptide pattern was observed with glycopeptides derived from surface, endoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondrial glycopeptides obtained from ethidium bromide-treated cells also seem to contain an increased amount of material eluting as a component of lower molecular weight than Peak B. This material, designated Peak C, may be located in the intramembrane space of the mitochondrion."
https://openalex.org/W1557870494,"Abstract A deoxyribonuclease purified from vaccinia virus was shown to have a specificity for single-stranded DNA. Undenatured HeLa cell DNA was digested at less than 2 % of the rate of thermally denatured DNA. The low rate of digestion was probably due to single-stranded regions in the isolated HeLa cell DNA since no nicking of native T7 DNA was detected by alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation. Evidence of endonucleolytic activity was obtained by sedimentation, gel filtration, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography of the digestion products. Exonucleolytic activity was also indicated by the high percentage of mononucleotides formed. The single-strand specificity and the endo- and exonucleolytic activities are similar to the previously described properties of the S1 nuclease from Aspergillus oryzae. The vaccinia deoxyribonuclease was also able to nick closed single-stranded circular DNA as well as closed superhelical double-stranded circles. The susceptibility of the latter probably resulted from the presence of weakly hydrogen-bonded regions in the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1564678903,"Abstract Nucleoside diphosphokinase from Salmonella typhimurium has been purified and characterized. In many respects, the enzyme is similar to those from higher organisms in that it has a broad specificity for both phosphate donor and recipient and that it functions via a ping-pong mechanism. The enzyme activity of cells is very high at all growth rates but decreases as growth rate increases. Evidence is presented that nucleoside diphosphokinase is sufficient to account for the synthesis of all nucleoside triphosphates required for the polymerization of nucleic acids and that it is probably the only enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of triphosphates from diphosphates and the γ-phosphate of ATP."

https://openalex.org/W1493297831,"Abstract Regulation of protein synthesis in BHK21/13 cells has been examined as a function of cell growth rate and density, both in vivo by pulse-labeling of cells with [3H]valine and in an in vitro cell-free protein-synthesizing system. The specific activity of [3H]valyl-tRNA in the pulse-labeled cells was determined and the true in vivo rate of [3H]valine incorporation into protein was measured. Unlike the reported behavior of many other cell lines, BHK21/13 cells did not shut off their protein synthesis at all while their growth rate declined 10-fold or more during density-dependent inhibition of growth or during arrest of growth by serum deprivation. In vitro assays of the cells' protein synthetic activity with both synthetic and natural messenger RNA confirmed that all of the components needed for protein synthesis were equally active in rapidly growing and in density-inhibited or serum-deprived cells. Hence, in these cells the protein synthesis rate and the cell division rate are not coupled, and the amount of protein in the cell is not regulated at the level of synthesis, but rather at the level of protein degradation or export."
https://openalex.org/W1508049358,"Abstract The addition of the substrate analog chloroacetaldehyde to the dioldehydrase-coenzyme B12 complex results in the appearance of an electron spin resonance signal at g = 2.2 and multiple signals at g = 2.0, amounting to a total of ∼2 unpaired electrons per molecule of enzyme-bound coenzyme. Substitution of deuterium for protium at the C-2 positions of chloroacetaldehyde results in a ∼5-G narrowing of the transition at g = 2.0 and in an additional transition in the g = 2.0 region, at 3285 G. Substitution of chloroacetaldehyde, uniformly enriched to 90% with 13C, results in a ∼10-G broadening of the signals at g = 2.0. No effect of such isotopic substitution is detected in the signal at g = 2.2, and little residual effect is noted at g = 2.0 after a 5-min preincubation. These results establish the transient appearance of spin density on carbon and possibly on hydrogen atoms derived from chloroacetaldehyde and partially assign the signals at g = 2.0 to radicals derived from chloroacetaldehyde. The presence of unpaired spin density on the methylene hydrogens of the substrate analog, the unusually wide ESR signals at g = 2.0 even at liquid nitrogen temperature, and the large kinetic isotope effects previously found with dioldehydrase, all suggest the participation of hydrogen atom transfer reactions in catalysis by coenzyme B12 enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1518002970,"Abstract The conformational transition in the polypeptide elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) associated with the ligand change from GTP to GDP has been suggested from the differences in their reactivity toward aminoacyl-tRNA. We have examined the structural changes in these two forms of EF-Tu near the active site interacting with aminoacyl-tRNA using the protein spin-labeled with N-ethylmaleimide analogues. It was found that, among three sulfhydryl groups of EF-Tu, the one essential for the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA could be labeled specifically in the presence of GDP. The electron spin resonance spectra of the spin-labeled EF-Tu GDP complex markedly changed when its GDP moiety was replaced by GTP by incubation with phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. The spectral changes unequivocally demonstrate that a reversible conformational change does occur in EF-Tu near the active site induced by the ligand conversion from GDP to GTP."
