https://openalex.org/W1985951136,"WHILE many agents are known to act as mutagens on the living cell, there have been no convincing reports that the genetic character of isolated particles, such as viruses or transforming principles, have been changed in vitro. Recent results with tobacco mosaic virus help to overcome this difficulty. The infective unit of the virus is its ribonucleic acid component, which can be isolated in active form1. It is made up of 6,000 nucleotides that probably form a single chain2."

https://openalex.org/W2094800695,"The results reported bear out the hypotheses that (i) pain tolerance is positively related to satiability; (ii) sensory deprivation tolerance is negatively related to satiability. It is inferred that satiability may prove to be in part the mechanism of tolerance and intolerance, and that pain tolerance is inversely related to sensory deprivation tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W2072366845,"Twenty-four goat mothers were separated from their newborn kids for 1 hour immediately following birth. Two months later these mothers were observed to nurse their own kids less and alien kids more than nonseparated mothers. Separation of mother and young in half the flock also resulted in abnormal ""rejecting"" behavior in some nonseparated mothers."

https://openalex.org/W1976965795,"Six rats, working in a 2 degrees C ambient temperature, were trained to depress a lever to receive a brief period of heat. Four rats were then moved into the 2 degrees C environment to live, while the others continued to live at room temperature. Living at a temperature of 2 degrees C increased the number of heat presentations the animals delivered to themselves."

https://openalex.org/W1971866394,"Growth hormone isolated from human pituitaries has been demonstrated to be a good antigen in the rabbit. With the rabbit antiserum to human somatotropin, it is possible to detect as little as 0.1 μg of the hormone by precipitin test. The antiserum was also capable of neutralizing the growth-promoting activity of human somatotropin."

Different strains of BCG have differing capacities to immunize by this means.

https://openalex.org/W2076232957,Chlorpromazine methyl-C(14) was administered to three groups of rats-orally to one group following chronic oral administration of the unlabeled drug; orally to an unprimed group; and intravenously to another unprimed group. Appearance of C(14)O(2) in the air expired by all animals indicated that the rat metabolized the side chain of the labeled drug.

https://openalex.org/W1994887846,Complement fixation tests with tissue-culture antigens indicated that polyoma virus is serologically unrelated to a wide variety of known viruses; antibody developed uniformly in mice given virus intraperitoneally or intranasally and was found in normal animals of several mouse colonies but not in human beings.
https://openalex.org/W2050840952,No variation in total amounts of those polycyclic hydrocarbons with ultraviolet absorption maxima at 385 mmicro was found in the smoke from cigarettes containing varying amounts of hexane solubles. Addition of C(l4)-labeled tobacco paraffins to cigarettes showed that tobacco paraffins are unimportant as precursors of polycyclic hydrocarbons in smoke.

https://openalex.org/W1991954324,"SEVERAL recent communications have dealt with the capacity of ingested hydrogen peroxide to affect the regression of implanted tumours in rats. Holman1 has claimed that a 0.45 per cent solution of hydrogen peroxide given to rats in lieu of tap-water caused regression of certain tumours ; the opposite conclusion has been stated by Green and Westrop2 and by Ghadially and Wiseman3. Accordingly, it seemed important to determine the effect of hydrogen peroxide on normal rats."

Ventricular magnesium tolerance was greatly reduced during hypothermia. Defibrillation was achieved by intracoronary injection of tetraethylammonium chloride and electrical shock, even at temperatures as low as 21°C, where it could not be achieved by other means."
https://openalex.org/W2094635762,"PYRIMETHAMINE, a folic acid antagonist, has been shown to potentiate the activity of sulphadimidine and sulphaquinoxaline against cæcal coccidiosis in chickens (ref. 1 and Ball, S. J., private communication). During our investigation of this combination, the decreased growth-rate and anæmia observed in Rhode Island × Light Sussex chickens fed for 28 days on an all-mash diet containing 20 p.p.m. of pyrimethamine, appeared to be controlled by a dose of 10 mgm./kgm. folic acid. The mean weight gain over the experimental period is shown in Table 1. Daily erythrocyte counts were made in blood taken from the wing vein (Fig. 1). After 21 days the erythrocyte count, hæmatocrit and hæmoglobin concentration in the heart blood and the total liver iron content of each of the birds were measured (Table 1). Sections of liver, treated with potassium ferrocyanide, were examined for hæmosiderosis."

https://openalex.org/W2086349218,The activation energy of ventricular contraction and relaxation in chloride and nitrate-Ringer's solution was studied on the driven rat ventricle strip by measurement of the specific contraction and relaxation velocities over a 17 degrees C range of temperature. Nitrate ion produced a small but significant reduction in the activation energy of contraction.
