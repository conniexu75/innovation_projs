https://openalex.org/W3213276455,"Although critical for host defense, innate immune cells are also pathologic drivers of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Innate immune dynamics during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) ARDS, compared to ARDS from other respiratory pathogens, is unclear. Moreover, mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of dexamethasone during severe COVID-19 remain elusive. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and plasma proteomics, we discovered that, compared to bacterial ARDS, COVID-19 was associated with expansion of distinct neutrophil states characterized by interferon (IFN) and prostaglandin signaling. Dexamethasone during severe COVID-19 affected circulating neutrophils, altered IFNactive neutrophils, downregulated interferon-stimulated genes and activated IL-1R2+ neutrophils. Dexamethasone also expanded immunosuppressive immature neutrophils and remodeled cellular interactions by changing neutrophils from information receivers into information providers. Male patients had higher proportions of IFNactive neutrophils and preferential steroid-induced immature neutrophil expansion, potentially affecting outcomes. Our single-cell atlas (see 'Data availability' section) defines COVID-19-enriched neutrophil states and molecular mechanisms of dexamethasone action to develop targeted immunotherapies for severe COVID-19."

https://openalex.org/W3212913189,"Epigenetic inheritance of gene expression states enables a single genome to maintain distinct cellular identities. How histone modifications contribute to this process remains unclear. Using global chromatin perturbations and local, time-controlled modulation of transcription, we establish the existence of epigenetic memory of transcriptional activation for genes that can be silenced by the Polycomb group. This property emerges during cell differentiation and allows genes to be stably switched after a transient transcriptional stimulus. This transcriptional memory state at Polycomb targets operates in cis; however, rather than relying solely on read-and-write propagation of histone modifications, the memory is also linked to the strength of activating inputs opposing Polycomb proteins, and therefore varies with the cellular context. Our data and computational simulations suggest a model whereby transcriptional memory arises from double-negative feedback between Polycomb-mediated silencing and active transcription. Transcriptional memory at Polycomb targets thus depends not only on histone modifications but also on the gene-regulatory network and underlying identity of a cell."
https://openalex.org/W3211956434,"The identification of patient-specific tumor antigens is complicated by the low frequency of T cells specific for each tumor antigen. Here we describe NeoScreen, a method that enables the sensitive identification of rare tumor (neo)antigens and of cognate T cell receptors (TCRs) expressed by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. T cells transduced with tumor antigen-specific TCRs identified by NeoScreen mediate regression of established tumors in patient-derived xenograft mice."
https://openalex.org/W3214477352,"Nuclear receptor-binding SET domain-containing 2 (NSD2) is the primary enzyme responsible for the dimethylation of lysine 36 of histone 3 (H3K36), a mark associated with active gene transcription and intergenic DNA methylation. In addition to a methyltransferase domain, NSD2 harbors two proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline (PWWP) domains and five plant homeodomains (PHDs) believed to serve as chromatin reading modules. Here, we report a chemical probe targeting the N-terminal PWWP (PWWP1) domain of NSD2. UNC6934 occupies the canonical H3K36me2-binding pocket of PWWP1, antagonizes PWWP1 interaction with nucleosomal H3K36me2 and selectively engages endogenous NSD2 in cells. UNC6934 induces accumulation of endogenous NSD2 in the nucleolus, phenocopying the localization defects of NSD2 protein isoforms lacking PWWP1 that result from translocations prevalent in multiple myeloma (MM). Mutations of other NSD2 chromatin reader domains also increase NSD2 nucleolar localization and enhance the effect of UNC6934. This chemical probe and the accompanying negative control UNC7145 will be useful tools in defining NSD2 biology."

https://openalex.org/W3212730460,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disorder in which motor neurons degenerate, the causes of which remain unclear. In particular, the basis for selective vulnerability of spinal motor neurons (sMNs) and resistance of ocular motor neurons to degeneration in ALS has yet to be elucidated. Here, we applied comparative multi-omics analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sMNs and ocular motor neurons to identify shared metabolic perturbations in inherited and sporadic ALS sMNs, revealing dysregulation in lipid metabolism and its related genes. Targeted metabolomics studies confirmed such findings in sMNs of 17 ALS (SOD1, C9ORF72, TDP43 (TARDBP) and sporadic) human induced pluripotent stem cell lines, identifying elevated levels of arachidonic acid. Pharmacological reduction of arachidonic acid levels was sufficient to reverse ALS-related phenotypes in both human sMNs and in vivo in Drosophila and SOD1G93A mouse models. Collectively, these findings pinpoint a catalytic step of lipid metabolism as a potential therapeutic target for ALS. By comparing human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived spinal and ocular motor neurons, the authors identify low levels of a natural 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) spinal motor neurons. Functional analogs of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors can ameliorate in vitro and in vivo ALS phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3129118764,"Immune checkpoint inhibition is effective in several cancers. Expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on circulating tumor or immune effector cells could provide insights into selection of patients for immune checkpoint inhibition.Whole blood was collected at serial timepoints from metastatic breast cancer patients and healthy donors for circulating tumor cell (CTC) and platelet PD-L1 analysis with a phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (Biolegend clone 29E.2A3) using the CellSearch® assay. CTC PD-L1 was considered positive if detected on at least 1% of the cells; platelet PD-L1 was considered positive if ≥100 platelets per CellSearch frame expressed PD-L1.A total of 207 specimens from 124 metastatic breast cancer patients were collected. 52/124 (42%) samples at timepoint-1 (at or close to time of progressive disease) had ≥5 CTC/7.5ml whole blood. Of those, 21 (40%) had positive CTC PD-L1. In addition, platelet PD-L1 expression was observed in 35/124 (28%) at timepoint-1. Platelet PD-L1 was not detected in more than 70 specimens from 12 healthy donors. Platelet PD-L1 was associated with ≥5 CTC/7.5ml whole blood (p = 0.0002), less likely in patients with higher red blood cell counts (OR = 0.72, p<0.001) and a history of smoking tobacco (OR = 0.76, p<0.001). Platelet PD-L1 staining was not associated with tumor marker status, recent procedures or treatments, platelet-affecting drugs, or CTC PD-L1 expression.PD-L1 expression was found in metastatic breast cancer patients on both CTC and platelets in an independent fashion. Inter-patient platelet PD-L1 expression was highly heterogeneous suggesting that it is a biological event associated with cancer in some but not all patients. Taken together, our data suggest that CTC and platelet PD-L1 expression could play a role in predicting which patients should receive immune checkpoint inhibition and as a pharmacodynamics biomarker during treatment."

https://openalex.org/W3211836737,"This study is designed to discuss the antimicrobial resistance, virulence determinants and biofilm formation capacity of Enterococcus spp. isolated from milk of sheep and goat with subclinical mastitis in Qena, Egypt. The obtained isolates were identified by the VITEK2 system and 16S rDNA sequencing as E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. casseliflavus and E. hirae. Overall, E. faecalis and E. faecium were the dominant species recovered from mastitic milk samples. The antimicrobial susceptibility test evidenced multidrug resistance of the isolates against the following antimicrobials: oxacillin (89.2.%), followed by vancomycin (75.7%) and linezolid (70.3%). Also, most of these isolates (73%) could form biofilms. For example, 18.9% of Enterococcus strains formed strong biofilm, whereas 32.4% of isolates formed moderate biofilm and 21.6% of isolates formed weak biofilm. The most prevalent resistance genes found in our isolates were blaZ (54%), vanA (40%), ermB (51.4%), tetM (13.5%) and optrA (10.8%). Moreover, asa1 (37.8%), cylA (42.3%), gelE (78.4%), esp (32.4%), EF3314(48.6%) and ace (75.5%) were the most common virulence genes. A significant correlation was found between biofilm formation, multidrug resistance and virulence genes of the isolates. This study highlights several aspects of virulence and harmfulness of Enterococcus strains isolated from subclinical mastitic milk, which necessitates continuous inspection and monitoring of dairy animals."
https://openalex.org/W3212014603,"Background A large portion of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States have occurred in nursing homes; however, current literature including the frontline perspective of staff working in nursing homes is limited. The objective of this qualitative assessment was to better understand what individual and facility level factors may have contributed to the impact of COVID-19 on Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) and Environmental Services (EVS) staff working in nursing homes. Methods Based on a simple random sample from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), 7,520 facilities were emailed invitations requesting one CNA and/or one EVS staff member for participation in a voluntary focus group over Zoom. Facility characteristics were obtained via NHSN and publicly available sources; participant demographics were collected via SurveyMonkey during registration and polling during focus groups. Qualitative information was coded using NVIVO and Excel. Results Throughout April 2021, 23 focus groups including 110 participants from 84 facilities were conducted homogenous by participant role. Staffing problems were a recurring theme reported. Participants often cited the toll the pandemic took on their emotional well-being, describing increased stress, responsibilities, and time needed to complete their jobs. The lack of consistent and systematic guidance resulting in frequently changing infection prevention protocols was also reported across focus groups. Conclusions Addressing concerns of low wages and lack of financial incentives may have the potential to attract and retain employees to help alleviate nursing home staff shortages. Additionally, access to mental health resources could help nursing home staff cope with the emotional burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. These frontline staff members provided invaluable insight and should be included in improvement efforts to support nursing homes recovering from the impact of COVID-19 as well as future pandemic planning."
https://openalex.org/W3211608407,"Vaccination against COVID-19 is a key global public health strategy. Health professionals including midwives and doctors support and influence vaccination uptake by childbearing women. There is currently no evidence regarding the COVID-19 vaccination perceptions and intentions of those who receive or provide maternity care in Australia. The aim of this study was to address this gap in knowledge and explore the perceptions and intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination from consumers and providers of maternity care in Australia.A national cross-sectional online study conducted in early 2021 in Australia, a country that has had a very low number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Recruitment was undertaken through parenting and health professional social media sites and professional college distribution lists. A total of 853 completed responses, from women (n = 326), maternity care providers including doctors (n = 58), midwives (n = 391) and midwifery students (n = 78).Personal intention to be vaccinated ranged from 48-89% with doctors most likely and women least likely. Doctors and midwifery students were significantly more likely to recommend the vaccine to pregnant women in their care than midwives (p<0.001). Fewer doctors (2%) felt that women should wait until breastfeeding had concluded before being vaccinated compared with 24% of midwives and 21% of midwifery students (p<0.001). More than half of the midwives (53%) had concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine for the women in their care compared with 35% of doctors and 46% of midwifery students. Despite national guidelines recommending vaccination of breastfeeding women, 54% of practitioners were unlikely to recommend vaccination for this group.This is the first study to explore the perceptions and intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination from the perspective of those who receive and provide maternity care in Australia. Findings have utility to support targeted public health messaging for these and other cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W3214724903,"Sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.), one of the most appreciated and most important commercial temperate fruits, has high sensory quality and nutritional value. Investigating its metabolic variations provides valuable information on the formation of fruit quality. In this study, widely targeted LC-MS/MS based metabolomics was used to identify and quantify metabolic changes during 'Black Pearl' sweet cherry development and ripening. A total of 263 significant differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were detected during the four fruit-development stages. Significant differences were observed in the composition and content of compounds in the four stages of cherry development, especially sugars, organic acids, and flavonoids. Moreover, transcriptome analysis provided a molecular basis for metabolic variations during fruit development. A total of 6724 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Further correlation analysis of major DEMs and DEGs showed that 19 key DEGs were involved in sugar metabolism, 23 key DEGs in organic acid metabolism, and 13 key DEGs in flavonoid metabolism. The upregulated genes involved in the flavonoid pathway probably play an important role in regulating the rapid increase of anthocyanin content during fruit development. These comprehensive analysis data provide a better understanding to improve fruit quality traits based on molecular and metabolic levels."

https://openalex.org/W3213882046,"Metastasis is the leading cause of death of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Although an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the involvement of G3BP2 in several human cancers, how G3BP2 interacts with long noncoding RNAs and regulates mRNA transcripts in mediating ESCC metastasis remains unclear. In this study, we uncovered that G3BP2 was upregulated in ESCC. Further analysis revealed that upregulation of G3BP2 was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, depth of tumor invasion and unfavorable outcomes in ESCC patients. Both in vitro and in vivo functional assays demonstrated that G3BP2 dramatically enhanced ESCC cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, LINC01554 maintained the high G3BP2 expression in ESCC by protecting G3BP2 from degradation through ubiquitination and the interaction domains within LINC01554 and G3BP2 were identified. In addition, RNA-seq revealed that HDGF was regulated by G3BP2. G3BP2 bound to HDGF mRNA transcript to stabilize its expression. Ectopic expression of HDGF effectively abolished the G3BP2 depletion-mediated inhibitory effect on tumor cell migration. Intriguingly, introduction of compound C108 which can inhibit G3BP2 remarkedly suppressed ESCC cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this study describes a newly discovered regulatory axis, LINC01554/G3BP2/HDGF, that facilitates ESCC metastasis and will provide novel therapeutic strategies for ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W3212125141,"The 2009 Indonesian roadmap to malaria elimination indicated that the nation had been progressing towards achieving malaria elimination by 2030. Currently, most of the districts in the western part of Indonesia have eliminated malaria; however, none of the districts in the East Nusa Tenggara Province (ENTP) have met these set targets. This study aimed to investigate the status of malaria awareness of rural adults in the ENTP.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted between October and December 2019 in high, moderate, and low malaria-endemic settings (MESs) in the ENTP. After obtaining informed consent, data were collected using an interviewer-administered structure questionnaire among 1503 participants recruited by a multi-stage cluster sampling method. A malaria awareness index was developed based on ten questions. A binary logistic regression method was applied to investigate the significance of any association between malaria awareness and the different MESs.The participation rate of the study was 99.5%. Of this number, 51.4% were female and 45.5% had completed primary education. The malaria awareness index was significantly low (48.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.2-52.4). Malaria awareness of rural adults residing in low endemic settings was two times higher than for those living in high endemic settings (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.81-3.21) and the basic malaria knowledge of participants living in low malaria-endemic settings was almost four times higher than that in high endemic settings (AOR: 3.75, 95% CI: 2.75-5.11). Of the total participants, 81.3% (95% CI: 79.1-83.5) were aware that malaria could be prevented and 75.1% (95% CI: 72.6-77.6) knew at least one prevention measure. Overall, the awareness of fever as the main symptom of malaria, mosquito bites as the transmission mode of malaria, and seeking treatment within 24 hours of suffering from malaria was poor at 37.9% (95% CI: 33.9-41.9), 59.1% (95% CI: 55.9-62.3), and 46.0% (95% CI: 42.3-49.7), respectively. The poor level of awareness was significantly different amongst the three MESs, with the lowest levels of awareness in the high endemic setting.Malaria awareness of rural adults needs to be improved to address Indonesia's national roadmap for malaria elimination. Results indicated that public health programs at a local government level should incorporate the malaria awareness index in their key strategic intervention to address malaria awareness."
https://openalex.org/W3212852072,"To compare hospitalized reproductive age women with COVID-19 who were pregnant, puerperal, or neither one nor the other in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics and disease progression using Brazilian epidemiological data.A retrospective analysis of the records of the Information System of the Epidemiological Surveillance of Influenza of the Health Ministry of Brazil was performed. It included the data of female patients aged 10 to 49 years hospitalized because of severe COVID-19 disease (RT-PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2), from February 17, 2020 to January 02, 2021. They were separated into 3 groups: pregnant, puerperal, and neither pregnant nor puerperal. General comparisons and then adjustments for confounding variables (propensity score matching [PSM]) were made, using demographic and clinical characteristics, disease progression (admission to the intensive care unit [ICU] and invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support), and outcome (cure or death). Deaths were analyzed in each group according to comorbidities, invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support, and admission to the ICU.As many as 40,640 reproductive age women hospitalized for COVID-19 were identified: 3,372 were pregnant, 794 were puerperal, and 36,474 were neither pregnant nor puerperal. Groups were significantly different in terms of demographic data and comorbidities (p<0.0001). Pregnant and puerperal women were less likely to be symptomatic than the women who were neither one nor the other (72.1%, 69.7% and 88.8%, respectively). Pregnant women, however, had a higher frequency of anosmia, and ageusia than the others. After PSM, puerperal women had a worse prognosis than pregnant women with respect to admission to the ICU, invasive ventilatory support, and death, with OR (95% CI) 1.97 (1.55 - 2.50), 2.71 (1.78 - 4.13), and 2.51 (1.79 - 3.52), respectively.Puerperal women were at a higher risk for serious outcomes (need for the ICU, need for invasive and noninvasive ventilatory support, and death) than pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W3213162820,"Social animals have the remarkable ability to organize into collectives to achieve goals unobtainable to individual members. Equally striking is the observation that despite differences in perceptual-motor capabilities, different animals often exhibit qualitatively similar collective states of organization and coordination. Such qualitative similarities can be seen in corralling behaviors involving the encirclement of prey that are observed, for example, during collaborative hunting amongst several apex predator species living in disparate environments. Similar encirclement behaviors are also displayed by human participants in a collaborative problem-solving task involving the herding and containment of evasive artificial agents. Inspired by the functional similarities in this behavior across humans and non-human systems, this paper investigated whether the containment strategies displayed by humans emerge as a function of the task's underlying dynamics, which shape patterns of goal-directed corralling more generally. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the strategies naïve human dyads adopt during the containment of a set of evasive artificial agents across two disparate task contexts. Despite the different movement types (manual manipulation or locomotion) required in the different task contexts, the behaviors that humans display can be predicted as emergent properties of the same underlying task-dynamic model."
https://openalex.org/W4226206004,"Mood disorders are more prevalent and often reported to be more severe in women; however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of this sexual prevalence. To gain insight into the functional differences in female brains in response to stress, we systemically compared brain activation in male and female C57BL/6N mice after acute stress exposure. We measured c-Fos expression levels in 18 brain areas related to stress responses after a 3-h long restraint stress and found that activation was sexually dimorphic in several brain areas, including the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, nucleus reuniens, and medial part of the lateral habenula. Moreover, stress-activated a substantial number of cells in the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and lateral part of the lateral habenula; however, the levels of activation were comparable in males and females, suggesting that the core stress responding machineries are largely shared. Pearson correlation analysis revealed several interesting connections between the analyzed areas that are implicated in stress responses and depression. Overall, stress strengthened intra-circuitries in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex in female mice, whereas more longer-range connections were highlighted in stressed male mice. Our study provides a highly valuable neuroanatomical framework for investigating the circuit mechanism underlying the higher vulnerability to depression in women."
https://openalex.org/W3211944402,"The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying mammary tumour dormancy and cancer recurrence are unclear and remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that mammary epithelial-specific disruption of β1 integrin in a murine model of Luminal B human breast cancer drastically impairs tumour growth with proliferation block, apoptosis induction and cellular senescence. β1 integrin-deficient dormant lesions show activation of the tumour suppressor p53, and tumours that circumvent dormancy possess p53 mutation analogous to those in human disease. We further demonstrate that mammary epithelial deletion of p53 in β1 integrin-deficient mice fully rescues tumour dormancy and bypasses cellular senescence. Additionally, recurrent β1 integrin-deficient tumours exhibit fibrosis with increased cancer-associated fibroblast infiltration and extracellular matrix deposition, absent in fast-growing β1 integrin/p53-deficient lesions. Taken together, these observations argue that β1 integrin modulates p53-dependent cellular senescence resulting in tumour dormancy and that pro-tumourigenic stromal cues and intrinsic genetic mutation are required for dormancy exit."
https://openalex.org/W3212726099,"Preeclampsia is both a vascular and inflammatory disorder. Since the placenta is a conduit for fetal development, preeclampsia should be a presumed cause of adverse infant outcomes. Yet, the relationship of placental pathology, inflammation and neurological outcomes after preeclampsia are understudied. We prospectively examined a cohort of maternal-infant dyads with preeclampsia for maternal inflammatory cytokines at time of preeclampsia diagnosis and delivery, and fetal cord blood cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α). Placentas were analyzed for inflammatory and vascular pathologies. Neurodevelopmental assessment of infants utilizing the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) was conducted at 6-month corrected gestational age. Eighty-one maternal-newborn dyads were examined. Worse neurological outcomes were not associated with elevated maternal / fetal cytokines. Early preterm birth (gestational age ≤ 32 weeks) was associated with worse neurological outcomes at 6-months regardless of maternal/ fetal cytokine levels, placental pathology, or cranial ultrasound findings (OR 1.70, [1.16-2.48], p = 0.006). When correcting for gestational age, elevated IL-6 approached significance as a predictor for worse developmental outcome (OR 1.025 [0.985-1.066], p = 0.221). Pathological evidence of maternal malperfusion and worse outcomes were noted in early preterm, although our sample size was small. Our study did not demonstrate an obvious association of inflammation and placental pathology in preeclampsia and adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at 6-month corrected age but does suggest maternal malperfusion at earlier gestational age may be a risk factor for worse outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3213106900,"Background People who smoke with serious mental illness carry disproportionate costs from smoking, including poor health and premature death from tobacco-related illnesses. Hospitals in New Zealand are ostensibly smoke-free; however, some mental health wards have resisted implementing this policy. Aim This study explored smoking in acute metal health wards using data emerging from a large sociological study on modern acute psychiatric units. Methods Eighty-five in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff and service users from four units. Data were analysed using a social constructionist problem representation approach. Results Although high-level smoke-free policies were mandatory, most participants disregarded these policies and smoking occurred in internal courtyards. Staff reasoned that acute admissions were not the time to quit smoking, citing the sceptres of distress and possibly violence; further, they found smoking challenging to combat. Inconsistent enforcement of smoke-free policies was common and problematic. Many service users also rejected smoke-free policies; they considered smoking facilitated social connections, alleviated boredom, and helped them feel calm in a distressing environment – some started or increased smoking following admission. A minority viewed smoking as a problem; a fire hazard, or pollutant. No one mentioned its health risks. Conclusion Psychiatric wards remain overlooked corners where hospital smoke-free policies are inconsistently applied or ignored. Well-meaning staff hold strong but anachronistic views about smoking. To neglect smoking cessation support for people with serious mental illness is discriminatory and perpetuates health and socioeconomic inequities. However, blanket applications of generic policy are unlikely to succeed. Solutions may include myth-busting education for service users and staff, local champions, and strong managerial support and leadership, with additional resourcing during transition phases. Smoke-free policies need consistent application with non-judgemental NRT and, potentially, other treatments. Smoking cessation would be supported by better designed facilities with more options for alleviating boredom, expressing autonomy, facilitating social connections, and reducing distress."
https://openalex.org/W3212028932,"HIV infection during pregnancy and breastfeeding has implications for maternal health. Between May- November 2018, we explored prospective acceptability of two novel HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) products, oral pills and vaginal rings, through focus group discussions with 65 pregnant and breastfeeding women in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe. Qualitative analysis was completed, guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). First, a deductive thematic analysis was applied to relevant coded data, into the seven TFA constructs (Affective Attitude; Burden; Ethicality, Intervention Coherence; Opportunity Costs; Perceived Effectiveness; Self-efficacy). Next, an iterative analysis was completed to generate themes within each of the TFA constructs. Women’s positive attitudes towards daily oral PrEP highlighted the familiarity of taking pills, understanding the purpose of taking pills, and the perception that it is an effective method to protect mothers and babies from HIV during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Women emphasized the ease of using the ring given its monthly duration that lowers burden on the user, its discreetness and invisibility once in place. The TFA analysis highlighted how acceptability of both methods could be enhanced by focusing on perceptions of the end users (i.e. the women) and not just the products themselves. This approach provided insights into how to refine the intervention materials and plans for implementation."
https://openalex.org/W3212121108,"The complete and accurate duplication of genomic information is vital to maintain genome stability in all domains of life. In Escherichia coli, replication termination, the final stage of the duplication process, is confined to the ""replication fork trap"" region by multiple unidirectional fork barriers formed by the binding of Tus protein to genomic ter sites. Termination typically occurs away from Tus-ter complexes, but they become part of the fork fusion process when a delay to one replisome allows the second replisome to travel more than halfway around the chromosome. In this instance, replisome progression is blocked at the nonpermissive interface of the Tus-ter complex, termination then occurs when a converging replisome meets the permissive interface. To investigate the consequences of replication fork fusion at Tus-ter complexes, we established a plasmid-based replication system where we could mimic the termination process at Tus-ter complexes in vitro. We developed a termination mapping assay to measure leading strand replication fork progression and demonstrate that the DNA template is under-replicated by 15 to 24 bases when replication forks fuse at Tus-ter complexes. This gap could not be closed by the addition of lagging strand processing enzymes or by the inclusion of several helicases that promote DNA replication. Our results indicate that accurate fork fusion at Tus-ter barriers requires further enzymatic processing, highlighting large gaps that still exist in our understanding of the final stages of chromosome duplication and the evolutionary advantage of having a replication fork trap."
https://openalex.org/W3212271572,"Obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are associated with hypoadiponectinemia. On the contrary, studies revealed correlations between the amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and higher serum adiponectin levels. Furthermore, independent association of intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) deposit in the thigh with cardiometabolic risk factors (including total blood cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides), and decreased insulin sensitivity, as MetS components, are sufficiently described. The combined relationship of thigh IMAT and SAT with serum adiponectin, leptin levels, and cardiometabolic risk factors have not been investigated till date. Since both SAT and IMAT play a role in fat metabolism, we hypothesized that the distribution pattern of SAT and IMAT in the mid-thigh might be related to adiponectin, leptin levels, and serum lipid parameters. We performed adipose tissue quantification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the mid-thigh in 156 healthy volunteers (78 male/78 female). Laboratory measurements of lipid panel, serum adiponectin, and leptin levels were conducted. Total serum adiponectin level showed a significant correlation with the percentage of SAT of the total thigh adipose tissue (SAT/ (IMAT+SAT)) for the whole study population and in sex-specific analysis. Additionally, SAT/(IMAT+SAT) was negatively correlated with known cardiometabolic risk factors such as elevated total blood cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides; but positively correlated with serum high-density lipoprotein. In multiple linear regression analysis, (SAT/(IMAT+SAT)) was the most strongly associated variable with adiponectin. Interestingly, leptin levels did not show a significant correlation with this ratio. Adipose tissue distribution in the mid-thigh is not only associated to serum adiponectin levels, independent of sex. This proposed quantitative parameter for adipose tissue distribution could be an indicator for individual factors of a person`s cardiometabolic risk and serve as additional non-invasive imaging marker to ensure the success of lifestyle interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3212534665,"Background Animal models used to study pathologies requiring rehabilitation therapy, such as cardiovascular and neurologic disorders or oncologic disease, must be as refined and translationally relevant as possible. Sometimes, however, experimental procedures such as those involving restraint may generate undesired effects which may act as a source of bias. However, the extent to which potentially confounding effects derive from such routine procedures is currently unknown. Our study was therefore aimed at exploring possible undesirable effects of acute restraint stress, whereby animals were exposed to a brightly lit enclosed chamber (R&amp;L) similar to those that are commonly used for substance injection. We hypothesised that this would induce a range of unwanted physiological alterations [such as neuroinflammatory response and changes in body weight and in brown adipose tissue (BAT)] and behavioural modification, and that these might be mitigated via the use of non-aversive handling methods: Tunnel Handling (NAH-T) and Mechanoceptive Handling (NAH-M)) as compared to standard Tail Handling (TH). Methods Two indicators of physiological alterations and three potentially stress sensitive behavioural parameters were assessed. Physiological alterations were recorded via body weight changes and assessing the temperature of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) using infra-red thermography (IRT), and at the end of the experiment we determined the concentration of cytokines CXCL12 and CCL2 in bone marrow (BM) and activated microglia in the brain. Nest complexity scoring, automated home-cage behaviour analysis (HCS) and Elevated Plus Maze testing (EPM) were used to detect any behavioural alterations. Recordings were made before and after a 15-minute period of R&amp;L in groups of mice handled via TH, NAH-T or NAH-M. Results BAT temperature significantly decreased in all handling groups following R&amp;L regardless of handling method. There was a difference, at the limit of significance (p = 0.06), in CXCL12 BM content among groups. CXCL12 content in BM of NAH-T animals was similar to that found in Sentinels, the less stressed group of animals. After R&amp;L, mice undergoing NAH-T and NAH-M showed improved body-weight maintenance compared to those exposed to TH. Mice handled via NAH-M spent a significantly longer time on the open arms of the EPM. The HCS results showed that in all mice, regardless of handling method, R&amp;L resulted in a significant reduction in walking and rearing, but not in total distance travelled. All mice also groomed more. No difference among the groups was found in Nest Score, in CCL2 BM content or in brain activated microglia. Conclusions Stress induced by a common restraint procedure caused metabolic and behavioural changes that might increase the risk of unexpected bias. In particular, the significant decrease in BAT temperature could affect the important metabolic pathways controlled by this tissue. R&amp;L lowered the normal frequency of walking and rearing, increased grooming and probably carried a risk of low-grade neuro-inflammation. Some of the observed alterations can be mitigated by Non-aversive handlings."
https://openalex.org/W3212682533,"Nematodes are abundant metazoans that play crucial roles in nutrient recycle in the pedosphere. Although high-throughput amplicon sequencing is a powerful tool for the taxonomic profiling of soil nematodes, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for amplification of the 18S ribosomal RNA (SSU) gene and preparation of template DNAs have not been sufficiently evaluated. We investigated nematode community structure in copse soil using four nematode-specific (regions 1–4) and two universal (regions U1 and U2) primer sets for the SSU gene regions with two DNAs prepared from copse-derived mixed nematodes and whole soil. The major nematode-derived sequence variants (SVs) identified in each region was detected in both template DNAs. Order level taxonomy and feeding type of identified nematode-derived SVs were distantly related between the two DNA preparations, and the region U2 was closely related to region 4 in the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Thus, the universal primers for region U2 could be used to analyze soil nematode communities. We further applied this method to analyze the nematodes living in two sampling sites of a sweet potato-cultivated field, where the plants were differently growing. The structure of nematode-derived SVs from the two sites was distantly related in the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) with weighted unifrac distances, suggesting their distinct soil environments. The resultant ecophysiological status of the nematode communities in the copse and field on the basis of feeding behavior and maturity indices was fairly consistent with those of the copse- and the cultivated house garden-derived nematodes in prior studies. These findings will be useful for the DNA metabarcoding of soil eukaryotes, including nematodes, using soil DNAs."
https://openalex.org/W3214101300,"Past research has identified the importance of cooperation among community-based organizations from different sectors to address public health problems such as insufficient physical activity. However, little is known about how and why interorganizational cooperation occurs. The present study sought to analyze the structure and emergent patterns of interorganizational cooperation within a network promoting physical activity based in an urban district neighborhood of a city in Southwestern Germany. Survey data on cooperative relations among 61 network organizations and organizational attributes (e.g., possession of sport facilities) were collected. Social network analysis was applied to examine network properties and exponential random graph models were estimated to test hypotheses concerning mechanisms and conditions of cooperative tie formation. The results show that the network of cooperation is sparse but characterized by a tendency for cooperation to occur in triangular structures. Other significant mechanisms of cooperative tie formation are preferential attachment, with the community department for education and sports being the most central network actor, and heterophily regarding the cooperation of organizations from different sectors. This study provides valid and reliable findings on conditions of network formation and significant mechanisms of interorganizational cooperation in the field of physical activity promotion. Knowledge about these mechanisms can help to manage networks effectively and efficiently and reveal potentials for improvement and intensification of interorganizational cooperation in both the present and other research areas of health promotion."

In February 2021, the State Council of China issued the outline of national integrated multidimensional transportation network planning (2021-2050), which proposed that during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, the Yangtze River Delta would speed up the construction of an integrated transport network to serve the dual circulation development pattern in China. However, few studies have systematically investigated the development of integrated transport in the Yangtze River Delta, especially the relationship between transport operating efficiency and regional innovation based on the theory of flow space. This study aims to calculate the integrated transport efficiency of 26 cities in the Yangtze River Delta and analyse the spillover effect of efficiency improvement on urban innovation. The results reveal that integrated transport efficiency is relatively stable at approximately 0.92. We find that the local innovation value would increase by 0.119% with every 1% increase in transport efficiency, and it would exceed 0.26% after introducing spatial factors. The spillover effect on the surrounding cities is significantly higher than that in the cities themselves, and the result is 0.292 under the economic spatial distance weight matrix. These findings will support the construction of the integrated transport network and provide useful references for government decision makers in the Yangtze River Delta."
https://openalex.org/W4226018165,"Mutation to the gene encoding dystrophin can cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and increase the sensitivity to stress in vertebrate species, including the mdx mouse model of DMD. Behavioral stressors can exacerbate some dystrophinopathy phenotypes of mdx skeletal muscle and cause hypotension-induced death. However, we have discovered that a subpopulation of mdx mice present with a wildtype-like response to mild (forced downhill treadmill exercise) and moderate (scruff restraint) behavioral stressors. These ""stress-resistant"" mdx mice are more physically active, capable of super-activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathways following behavioral stress and they express greater levels of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in striated muscle relative to ""stress-sensitive"" mdx mice. Stress-resistant mdx mice also presented with a less severe striated muscle histopathology and greater exercise and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity at rest. Most interestingly, female mdx mice were more physically active following behavioral stressors compared to male mdx mice; a response abolished after ovariectomy and rescued with estradiol. We demonstrate that the response to behavioral stress greatly impacts disease severity in mdx mice suggesting the management of stress in patients with DMD be considered as a therapeutic approach to ameliorate disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3134994516,"The increased incidence of dental caries by cigarette smoking (CS) has been widely reported in epidemiological studies, but the relationship between CS and cariogenic biofilm growth has been rarely studied. This study aims to investigate the effects of CS exposure on the growth and virulence of Streptococcus mutans biofilms (S. mutans). Briefly, S. mutans biofilms were formed on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite disks, which were exposed to CS 1, 3, and 6 times per day, respectively. In addition, S. mutans biofilms without CS exposure were considered as the control group. Acidogenicity, dry weight, colony-forming units (CFUs), water-soluble/insoluble extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs), and intracellular polysaccharides (IPSs) were analyzed and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of 74-h-old S. mutans biofilms were obtained. The lowest accumulation of biofilms and EPSs were detected in the 6 times/day CS exposure group compared with those of the control group and other CS exposure groups in 74-h-old S. mutans biofilms. CLSM also revealed the lowest bacterial count (live and dead cells) and EPSs biovolume in the six times/day CS exposure group in 74-h-old S. mutans biofilms. CS exposure inhibited the growth of S. mutans biofilm in vitro study, the anti-cariogenic biofilm formation was enhanced with a dose (frequency)-dependent at which frequency has more influence in the present findings."
https://openalex.org/W3212944079,"Amelogenins, major extra cellular matrix proteins of developing tooth enamel, are predominantly expressed by ameloblasts and play significant roles in the formation of enamel. Recently, amelogenin has been detected in various epithelial and mesenchymal tissues, implicating that it might have distinct functions in various tissues. We have previously reported that leucine rich amelogenin peptide (LRAP), one of the alternate splice forms of amelogenin, regulates receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand (RANKL) expression in cementoblast/periodontal ligament cells, suggesting that the amelogenins, especially LRAP, might function as a signaling molecule in bone metabolism. The objective of this study was to identify and define LRAP functions in bone turnover. We engineered transgenic (TgLRAP) mice using a murine 2.3kb α1(I)-collagen promoter to drive expression of a transgene consisting of LRAP, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) to study functions of LRAP in bone formation and resorption. Calvarial cell cultures from the TgLRAP mice showed increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and increased formation of mineralized nodules compared to the cells derived from wild-type (WT) mice. The TgLRAP calvarial cells also showed an inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Gene expression comparison by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) in calvarial cells indicated that bone formation makers such as Runx2, Alp, and osteocalcin were increased in TgLRAP compared to the WT cells. Meanwhile, Rankl expression was decreased in the TgLRAP cells in vitro. The ovariectomized (OVX) TgLRAP mice resisted bone loss induced by ovariectomy resulting in higher bone mineral density in comparison to OVX WT mice. The quantitative analysis of calcein intakes indicated that the ovariectomy resulted in increased bone formation in both WT and TgLRAP mice; OVX TgLRAP appeared to show the most remarkably increased bone formation. The parameters for bone resorption in tissue sections showed increased number of osteoclasts in OVX WT, but not in OVX TgLRAP over that of sham operated WT or TgLRAP mice, supporting the observed bone phenotypes in OVX mice. This is the first report identifying that LRAP, one of the amelogenin splice variants, affects bone turnover in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3213721557,"Bacterial degradation of xenobiotic compounds is an intense field of research already for decades. Lately, this research is complemented by downstream applications including Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), RT-PCR, qPCR, and RNA-seq. For most of these molecular applications, high-quality RNA is a fundamental necessity. However, during the degradation of aromatic substrates, phenolic or polyphenolic compounds such as polycatechols are formed and interact irreversibly with nucleic acids, making RNA extraction from these sources a major challenge. Therefore, we established a method for total RNA extraction from the aromatic degrading Pseudomonas capeferrum TDA1 based on RNAzol® RT, glycogen and a final cleaning step. It yields a high-quality RNA from cells grown on TDA1 and on phenol compared to standard assays conducted in the study. To our knowledge, this is the first report tackling the problem of polyphenolic compound interference with total RNA isolation in bacteria. It might be considered as a guideline to improve total RNA extraction from other bacterial species."
https://openalex.org/W3213741665,"Background Chronic alcohol use is a risk factor for non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma. However, it is less well understood whether alcohol use is a risk factor for premalignant mucosal changes, namely gastric intestinal metaplasia. We examined the association between various parameters of alcohol use and risk of gastric intestinal metaplasia. Methods We used data from 2084 participants (including 403 with gastric intestinal metaplasia) recruited between February 2008-August 2013 into a cross-sectional study at the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston, Texas. All participants underwent a study upper endoscopy with systematic gastric mapping biopsies. Cases had intestinal metaplasia on any non-cardia gastric biopsy. Participants self-reported lifetime history of alcohol consumption, along with other lifestyle risk factors, through a study survey. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for categories of average alcohol consumption using multivariable logistic regression, and restricted cubic spline regression to explore the potential shape of a dose-response relationship. Results Compared to lifelong non-drinkers, individuals who consumed on average ≥28 drinks per week had no elevated risk for gastric intestinal metaplasia (adjusted OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.74–2.19). Based on a spline regression curve and its 95% CI, there was also no demonstrable association between cumulative lifetime alcohol consumption and risk of gastric intestinal metaplasia. Similarly, we found no association between beverage type (beer, wine, liquor/spirits) and risk for gastric intestinal metaplasia. Conclusions Neither amount of alcohol consumed nor specific beverage type was associated with risk of gastric intestinal metaplasia."
https://openalex.org/W3214631958,"Digitalization has changed working life and increased cognitive demands on employees in general. Nevertheless, the consequences for employees with cognitive impairments and subjective cognitive difficulties are to a large extent unexplored. The aim of this study was to explore and describe how employees with subjective cognitive difficulties who are performing digital work tasks experience their vocational situation and how this situation influences their everyday life.A qualitative, descriptive, multiple-case study was designed. Self-reports, assessments and qualitative interviews were used to collect data from the seven participants with neurological disorders. The data were analysed using pattern matching.The analysed data formed four categories conceptualized as ""Working to my full potential"", ""Working, but it is largely up to me"", ""Working at the expense of everyday life"" and ""Working without known difficulties"", and these categories included one to four subcategories.Managing subjective cognitive difficulties in vocational situations and everyday life was challenging in a digitalized working life for participants with neurological disorders. To provide equal access to preventive measures and rehabilitation and a sustainable working life, it is important to investigate the influence of subjective cognitive difficulties systematically on work, everyday life and management strategies in people with neurological disorders in digitalized work."
https://openalex.org/W3211777398,"An area of ancient and semi-natural woodland (ASNW) has been investigated by applied aerial spectroscopy using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with multispectral image (MSI) camera. A novel normalised difference spectral index (NDSI) algorithm was developed using principal component analysis (PCA). This novel NDSI was then combined with a simple segmentation method of thresholding and applied for the identification of native tree species as well as the overall health of the woodland. Using this new approach allowed the identification of trees at canopy level, across 7.4 hectares (73,934 m2) of ASNW, as oak (53%), silver birch (37%), empty space (9%) and dead trees (1%). This UAV derived data was corroborated, for its accuracy, by a statistically valid ground-level field study that identified oak (47%), silver birch (46%) and dead trees (7.4%). This simple innovative approach, using a low-cost multirotor UAV with MSI camera, is both rapid to deploy, was flown around 100 m above ground level, provides useable high resolution (5.3 cm / pixel) data within 22 mins that can be interrogated using readily available PC-based software to identify tree species. In addition, it provides an overall oversight of woodland health and has the potential to inform a future woodland regeneration strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3212036076,"Increasing oncological treatment costs are a major global concern with the risk of entailing two-tiered health care. Among cost determining factors is the price of individual drugs. In recognition of the central role of this factor, we present a comprehensive overview of the development of monthly prices of oncological drugs introduced over the last 15 years in Switzerland. We identified all oncological drugs newly reimbursed by mandatory health insurance in 2005-2019, and searched public repositories for their package prices, indications with approval dates, and treatment regimens for the calculation of (indication-specific) monthly prices. We found 81 products covering 77 different substances (39.5% protein kinase inhibitors, 21.0% monoclonal antibodies). Most indications related to the topography ""blood"", followed by ""lung and thorax"" and ""digestive tract"". From 2005–2009 to 2015–2019, the median monthly product price over all distinct indications of all products decreased by 7.56% (CHF 5,699 [interquartile range 4,483–7,321] to CHF 5,268 [4,019–6,967]), whereas it increased by 73.7% for monoclonal antibodies. In December 2019, six products had monthly prices over CHF 10,000, all approved for hematological or dermatological cancers. Our analysis suggests that individual price developments of oncological drugs are presently not the major driver of rising cancer treatment costs. However, rising launch prices of some new, mostly hematological drugs are of concern and require continued monitoring."

https://openalex.org/W3212427487,"ClpAP, an ATP-dependent protease consisting of ClpA, a double-ring hexameric unfoldase of the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities superfamily, and the ClpP peptidase, degrades damaged and unneeded proteins to support cellular proteostasis. ClpA recognizes many protein substrates directly, but it can also be regulated by an adapter, ClpS, that modifies ClpA's substrate profile toward N-degron substrates. Conserved tyrosines in the 12 pore-1 loops lining the central channel of the stacked D1 and D2 rings of ClpA are critical for degradation, but the roles of these residues in individual steps during direct or adapter-mediated degradation are poorly understood. Using engineered ClpA hexamers with zero, three, or six pore-1 loop mutations in each ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities superfamily ring, we found that active D1 pore loops initiate productive engagement of substrates, whereas active D2 pore loops are most important for mediating the robust unfolding of stable native substrates. In complex with ClpS, active D1 pore loops are required to form a high affinity ClpA•ClpS•substrate complex, but D2 pore loops are needed to ""tug on"" and remodel ClpS to transfer the N-degron substrate to ClpA. Overall, we find that the pore-1 loop tyrosines in D1 are critical for direct substrate engagement, whereas ClpS-mediated substrate delivery requires unique contributions from both the D1 and D2 pore loops. In conclusion, our study illustrates how pore loop engagement, substrate capture, and powering of the unfolding/translocation steps are distributed between the two rings of ClpA, illuminating new mechanistic features that may be common to double-ring protein unfolding machines."
https://openalex.org/W3214245601,"Hepatitis B is a leading cause of death worldwide. Here, we performed a large, population-based, cross-sectional study in Chongqing, China from 2011 to 2016 to assess the prevalence of HBsAg among couples of reproductive age, to predict subsequent trends, and to provide evidence for the WHO goal of ""the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030"". A total of 386,286 couples aged 20 to 49 years were enrolled in the study. Approximately 14.35% of couples were HBsAg positive, including 95.00% with discordant HBsAg positivity. HBsAg prevalence was higher in men than in women. Among different occupations, the two categories of “houseworker” (female 6.73%, male 9.99%) and “unemployed” (female 6.64%, male 9.94%) showed the highest HBsAg positivity. In different regions, the lowest prevalence appeared in southeastern Chongqing (female 4.87%, male 7.71%). In 2030, the HBsAg positivity rate is expected to be 2.79%, 7.27% and 5.13% in females, males, and the whole population, respectively. According to the trends, this rate would drop to less than 2% in 2034, 2078 and 2051. In conclusion, the HBsAg prevalence in Chongqing is still relatively high compared with that in other parts of western China, especially among reproductive-age men. HBsAg-positive couples should be taken as an important unit of care. Vaccination is necessary before pregnancy if no antibody is found. More attention should be given to people without stable jobs. HBsAg-positive rate will decrease perceptibly by 2030 and will reach the level of low in epidemic areas by 2050."

We aimed to assess the potential effectiveness and ease of use of an online version of the Risk Acceptance Ladder (RAL) in promoting help-seeking for cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, insufficient physical activity, or low fruit and vegetable consumption.843 UK adults were recruited, of whom 602 engaged in at least one risky behaviour. Those with no immediate plans to change (n = 171) completed a behaviour specific RAL. Participants were randomised to one of two conditions; a short message congruent (on-target, n = 73) or incongruent (off-target, n = 98) with their RAL response. Performance of the RAL was assessed by participants' ability to select an applicable RAL item and reported ease of use of the RAL. Effectiveness was assessed by whether or not participants clicked a link to receive information about changing their target behaviour.Two thirds (68.9%, 95% CI = 61.8%-75.3%) of participants were able to select an applicable RAL item that corresponded to what they believed would need to change in order to alter their target behaviour, with 64.9% (95% CI = 57.5%-71.7%) reporting that it was easy to select one option. Compared with the off-target group, participants allocated to the on-target group had greater odds of clicking on the link to receive information (31.5% vs 19.4%; OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.01-4.26).The Risk Acceptance Ladder may have utility as a tool for tailoring messages to prompt initial steps to engaging in self-protective behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W3211927289,"Critical care clinicians practice a liminal medicine at the border between life and death, witnessing suffering and tragedy which cannot fail to impact the clinicians themselves. Clinicians' professional identity is predicated upon their iterative efforts to articulate and contextualize these experiences, while a failure to do so may lead to burnout. This journey of self-discovery is illuminated by clinician narratives which capture key moments in building their professional identity. We analyzed a collection of narratives by critical care clinicians to determine which experiences most profoundly impacted their professional identity formation. After surveying 30 critical care journals, we identified one journal that published 84 clinician narratives since 2013; these constituted our data source. A clinician educator, an art historian, and an anthropologist analyzed these pieces using a narrative analysis technique identifying major themes and subthemes. Once the research team agreed on a thematic structure, a clinician-ethicist and a trainee read all the pieces for analytic validation. The main theme that emerged across all these pieces was the experience of existing at the heart of the dynamic tension between life and death. We identified three further sub-themes: the experience of bridging the existential divide between dissimilar worlds and contexts, fulfilling divergent roles, and the concurrent experience of feeling dissonant emotions. Our study constitutes a novel exploration of transformative clinical experiences within Critical Care, introducing a methodology that equips medical educators in Critical Care and beyond to better understand and support clinicians in their professional identity formation. As clinician burnout soars amidst increasing stressors on our healthcare systems, a healthy professional identity formation is an invaluable asset for personal growth and moral resilience. Our study paves the way for post-graduate and continuing education interventions that foster mindful personal growth within the medical subspecialties."
https://openalex.org/W3212208092,"In Arabic, a predominantly consonantal script that features a high incidence of lexical ambiguity (heterophonic homographs), glyph-like marks called diacritics supply vowel information that clarifies how each consonant should be pronounced, and thereby disambiguate the pronunciation of consonantal strings. Diacritics are typically omitted from print except in situations where a particular homograph is not sufficiently disambiguated by the surrounding context. In three experiments we investigated whether the presence of disambiguating diacritics on target homographs modulates word frequency, length, and predictability effects during reading. In all experiments, the subordinate representation of the target homographs was instantiated by the diacritics (in the diacritized conditions), and by the context subsequent to the target homographs. The results replicated the effects of word frequency (Experiment 1), word length (Experiment 2), and predictability (Experiment 3). However, there was no evidence that diacritics-based disambiguation modulated these effects in the current study. Rather, diacritized targets in all experiments attracted longer first pass and later (go past and/or total fixation count) processing. These costs are suggested to be a manifestation of the subordinate bias effect. Furthermore, in all experiments, the diacritics-based disambiguation facilitated later sentence processing, relative to when the diacritics were absent. The reported findings expand existing knowledge about processing of diacritics, their contribution towards lexical ambiguity resolution, and sentence processing."
https://openalex.org/W3212558936,"The model is based on a vector representation of each agent. The components of the vector are the key continuous ""attributes"" that determine the social behavior of the agent. A simple mathematical force vector model is used to predict the effect of each agent on all other agents. The force law used is motivated by gravitational force laws and electrical force laws for dipoles. It assumes that the force between two agents is proportional to the ""similarity of attributes"", which is implemented mathematically as the dot product of the vectors representing the attributes of the agents, and the force goes as the inverse square of the difference in attributes, which is expressed as the Euclidean distance in attribute space between the two vectors. The force between the agents may be positive (attractive), zero, or negative (repulsive) depending on whether the angle between the corresponding vectors is less than, equal to, or greater than 90°. A positive force causes the attributes of the agents to become more similar and the corresponding vectors to become more nearly parallel. Interaction between all agents is allowed unless the distance between the attributes representing the agents exceeds a confidence limit (the Attribute Influence Bound) set in the simulation. Agents with similar attributes tend to form groups. For small values of the Attribute Influence Bound, numerous groups remain scattered throughout attribute space at the end of a simulation. As the Attribute Influence Bound is increased, and agents with increasingly different attributes can communicate, fewer groups remain at the end, and the remaining groups have increasingly different characteristic attributes and approximately equal sizes. With a large Attribute Influence Bound all agents are connected and extreme bi- or tri-polarization results. During the simulations, depending on the initial conditions, collective behaviors of grouping, consensus, fragmentation and polarization are observed as well as certain symmetries specific to the model, for example, the average of the attributes for all agents does not change significantly during a simulation."
https://openalex.org/W3213615431,"COVID-19 vaccination in many countries, including England, has been prioritised primarily by age. However, people of the same age can have very different health statuses. Frailty is a commonly used metric of health and has been found to be more strongly associated with mortality than age among COVID-19 inpatients.We compared the number of first vaccine doses administered across the 135 NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) of England to both the over 50 population and the estimated frail population in each area. Area-based frailty estimates were generated using the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA), a national survey of older people. We also compared the number of doses to the number of people with other risk factors associated with COVID-19: atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, learning disabilities, obesity and smoking status.We estimate that after 79 days of the vaccine program, across all Clinical Commissioning Group areas, the number of people who received a first vaccine per frail person ranged from 4.4 (95% CI 4.0-4.8) and 20.1 (95% CI 18.3-21.9). The prevalences of other risk factors were also poorly associated with the prevalence of vaccination across England.Vaccination with age-based priority created area-based inequities in the number of doses administered relative to the number of people who are frail or have other risk factors associated with COVID-19. As frailty has previously been found to be more strongly associated with mortality than age for COVID-19 inpatients, an age-based priority system may increase the risk of mortality in some areas during the vaccine roll-out period. Authorities planning COVID-19 vaccination programmes should consider the disadvantages of an age-based priority system."

We examined differences between groups in terms of their business performance. The HINoV algorithm allowed six variables to be selected out of 32 management practices chosen initially for testing, with these variables providing the basis for grouping. Modal values and medians were calculated for 17 business performance measures in the three clusters produced. The subsequent analysis of those findings was focused on capturing significant differences.In the group of 2710 Polish SMEs, it was possible to verify that there existed an association between management practices in the field of modern HRM, computer systems supporting management and the company's economic performance, as measured by an increase in net revenue and number of customers over the last three years. In clusters where the above mentioned practices were appreciated, modal and median values of the increase reported in net revenue and number of customers were significantly higher.The research has shown that at a time marked by a shortage of highly skilled personnel one should pay particular attention to building an integrated and committed team of workers and to employee empowerment. The research has also shown that SME managers monitor only a fraction of basic business performance measures, which may prove to be a major risk to SMEs.Previous studies have been largely conducted in a fragmentary manner, i.e. they were concerned with the relationships between the application of some practices (strategic management, BPR, entrepreneurial orientation, monitoring, etc.) and selected business effectiveness measures. In this paper, the research covered SME management practices from a variety of areas which were then compared with the entrepreneurs' assessment as to whether the company's economic condition changed over the last three years. It is also the first attempt in post-socialist economies to identify those SME management practices that are related to better economic results."
https://openalex.org/W3213770726,"The three-chamber experiment, in which one test animal can choose between two animals placed in physically inaccessible compartments, is a widely adopted strategy for studying sexual preference in animals. Medaka, a small freshwater teleost, is an emerging model for dissecting the neurological/physiological mechanisms underlying mate choice for which intriguing findings have been accumulating. The three-chamber strategy has rarely been adopted in this species; therefore, here we investigated its validity using medaka colour variants that mate assortatively. First, a total of 551 movies, in which a test male and two choice females interacted for 30 min under a free-swimming condition, were manually analysed. The sexual preference of the males, calculated as a courtship ratio, was highly consistent between human observers (r > 0.96), supporting the objectivity of this manual-counting strategy. Second, we tested two types of three-chamber apparatuses, in which choice fish were presented in either a face-to-face or side-by-side location. Test fish (regardless of sex) spent most of the time associating with choice fish in the compartments. However, their sexual preference, calculated as an association ratio, was poorly reproduced when the locations of the choice fish were swapped. Third, the sexual preferences of males quantified using the manual-counting and either of the three-chamber strategies did not correlate (r = 0.147 or 0.297). Hence, we concluded that, even for individuals of a species like medaka, which spawn every day, sexual preference could not be reliably evaluated using the three-chamber strategy. Optimization of the protocol may solve this problem; however, the explanation for the observation that animals that are ready for spawning persist with never-accessible mating partners must be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W3214128061,"Pitch peaks tend to be higher at the beginning of longer than shorter sentences (e.g., 'A farmer is pulling donkeys' vs 'A farmer is pulling a donkey and goat'), whereas pitch valleys at the ends of sentences are rather constant for a given speaker. These data seem to imply that speakers avoid dropping their voice pitch too low by planning the height of sentence-initial pitch peaks prior to speaking. However, the length effect on sentence-initial pitch peaks appears to vary across different types of sentences, speakers and languages. Therefore, the notion that speakers plan sentence intonation in advance due to the limitations in low voice pitch leaves part of the data unexplained. Consequently, this study suggests a complementary cognitive account of length-dependent pitch scaling. In particular, it proposes that the sentence-initial pitch raise in long sentences is related to high demands on mental resources during the early stages of sentence planning. To tap into the cognitive underpinnings of planning sentence intonation, this study adopts the methodology of recording eye movements during a picture description task, as the eye movements are the established approximation of the real-time planning processes. Measures of voice pitch (Fundamental Frequency) and incrementality (eye movements) are used to examine the relationship between (verbal) working memory (WM), incrementality of sentence planning and the height of sentence-initial pitch peaks."
