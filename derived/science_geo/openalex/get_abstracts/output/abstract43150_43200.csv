https://openalex.org/W2061903251,"In cells that do not express immunoglobulin kappa light chain genes, the kappa enhancer binding protein NF-κB is found in cytosolic fractions and exhibits DNA binding activity only in the presence of a dissociating agent such as sodium deoxycholate. The dependence on deoxycholate is shown to result from association of NF-κB with a 60- to 70-kilodalton inhibitory protein (IκB). The fractionated inhibitor can inactivate NF-κB from various sources—including the nuclei of phorbol ester-treated cells—in a specific, saturable, and reversible manner. The cytoplasmic localization of the complex of NF-κB and IκB was supported by enucleation experiments. An active phorbol ester must therefore, presumably by activation of protein kinase C, cause dissociation of a cytoplasmic complex of NF-κB and IκB by modifying IκB. This releases active NF-κB which can translocate into the nucleus to activate target enhancers. The data show the existence of a phorbol ester-responsive regulatory protein that acts by controlling the DNA binding activity and subcellular localization of a transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W2009179035,"Single-chain antigen-binding proteins are novel recombinant polypeptides, composed of an antibody variable light-chain amino acid sequence (VL) tethered to a variable heavy-chain sequence (VH) by a designed peptide that links the carboxyl terminus of the VL sequence to the amino terminus of the VH sequence. These proteins have the same specificities and affinities for their antigens as the monoclonal antibodies whose VL and VH sequences were used to construct the recombinant genes that were expressed in Escherichia coli. Three of these proteins, one derived from the sequence for a monoclonal antibody to growth hormone and two derived from the sequences of two different monoclonal antibodies to fluorescein, were designed, constructed, synthesized, purified, and assayed. These proteins are expected to have significant advantages over monoclonal antibodies in a number of applications."

Concentration detection limits range from 5 x 10(-12) molar for alanine to 9 x 10(-11) molar for lysine, injected in the column; 9 x 10(-21) mole of alanine is contained within the approximately 1-nanoliter injection volume at the detection limit. The alanine detection limit corresponds to fewer than 6000 molecules injected onto the column and represents an improvement of four orders of magnitude in the state of the art for fluorescent detection of amino acids and an improvement of six orders of magnitude in the state of the art for the detection limit for isothiocyanate derivatives of amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1483201238,"A cationic peptide, designated tachyplesin, was isolated from acid extracts of horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) hemocyte debris. It consists of 17 residues and the structure determined by Edman degradation is: (formula; see text) The carboxyl-terminal end of this peptide was identified as arginine alpha-amide, and the whole sequence including the alpha-amide was also confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, indicating a mass value of 2263. Tachyplesin inhibits growth of both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria at low concentrations and formed a complex with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Tachyplesin seems likely to act as antimicrobial peptide for self-defense in the horseshoe crab against invading microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W1535473877,"Latent multicatalytic protease complexes, named proteasomes, were purified to apparent homogeneity from various eukaryotic sources, such as human, rat, and chicken liver, Xenopus laevis ovary, and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and their functional and structural properties were compared. They showed latency in breakdown of [methyl-3H]casein, but were greatly activated in various ways, such as by addition of polylysine. They all degraded three types of fluorogenic oligopeptides at the carboxyl side of basic, neutral, and acidic amino acids, and the three cleavage reactions showed different spectra for inhibition, suggesting that they had three distinct active sites. The proteasomes all seemed to be seryl endopeptidases with similar pH optima in the weakly alkaline region. Their physiochemical properties, such as their sedimentation coefficients (19 S to 22 S), diffusion coefficients (2.0-2.6 X 10(-7) cm2 s-1), molecular masses (700-900 kDa), and circular dichroic spectra, were similar. Their amino acid compositions were also very similar. Electron microscopy showed that they had similar well-defined symmetrical morphology, appearing to be ring-shaped particles with a small hole in the center. All the proteasomes seemed to be multisubunit complexes consisting of 15-20 polypeptides with molecular masses of 22-33 kDa and isoelectric points of pH 3-10, but they showed species-specific differences in subunit multiplicity. Moreover, they differed immunologically, as shown by Ouchterlony tests and immunoblotting analyses, although cross-immunoreactivities of some subunits or domains were observed. These results indicate that the sizes and shapes of these proteasomes have been highly conserved during evolution, but that they show species-specific differences in immunoreactivities and subunit structures. Thus proteasomes with similar structure and function seem to be ubiquitously distributed in eukaryotic organisms ranging from man to yeast. This distribution implies the general importance of these proteasomes for proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1581760931,"The activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), the regulatory enzyme in arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin synthesis, was measured in cell-free extracts of rat renal mesangial cells. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) both stimulated PLA2 activity as assayed by the release of free arachidonic acid from exogenously added [14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine. This represents a direct in vitro demonstration of hormone-induced changes in PLA2 activity. The stimulated activity was recovered following fractionation by DEAE-cellulose anion exchange and FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration. Stimulated activity from AVP- and PMA-treated cells comigrated as a single peak, suggesting that these agents are stimulating a single form of the enzyme. The molecular weight of this hormonally regulated form of PLA2 is approximately 60,000. The enzyme has an obligate requirement for Ca2+, having no activity in the presence of EGTA, and has a pH optimum in the alkaline range. Following cell disruption in the presence of chelators, the enzyme is recovered in a high speed supernatant. However, it appears that it can bind to a crude membrane fraction in a Ca2+-dependent manner, similar to other Ca2+-phospholipid binding proteins. The observed stable modification in PLA2 activity by AVP and PMA suggests a phosphorylation of PLA2 or PLA2 modulators by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2167168167,"The correct segregation of neural from epidermal lineages in Drosophila embryogenesis depends on the activity of the six zygotic ""neurogenic"" genes. One of the neurogenic genes, Enhancer of split, is particularly noteworthy in its genetic interactions with Notch and Delta, which both appear to code for transmembrane proteins with homology to the epidermal growth factor. Transformation experiments have demonstrated the cloning of sequences necessary for Enhancer of split gene function. We report here that the gene product derived from DNA sequencing shows homology to the beta subunit of mammalian G proteins and CDC4, a yeast cell cycle gene. We demonstrate that expression of the transcripts relates to the developing central nervous system. These data suggest a mechanism of interaction between the gene products of Notch and Enhancer of split."
https://openalex.org/W1994431332,"The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilizes retinal images by generating smooth eye movements that are equal in amplitude and opposite in direction to head turns. Whenever image motion occurs persistently during head turns, the VOR undergoes motor learning; as a result image stability is gradually restored. A group of brain stem neurons that are in the modified pathways has now been described. The neurons express changes in firing in association with motor learning in the VOR and receive monosynaptic inhibition from the flocculus of the cerebellum. The changes in firing have an appropriate magnitude and are expressed at the correct latency to account for the altered VOR. The response properties of the neurons point to their brain stem vestibular inputs for further investigation of the site of motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W1558802435,"Gb (b for botulinum) is an Mr 21,000-22,000 guanine nucleotide binding protein which is specifically ADP-ribosylated by an ADP-ribosyltransferase produced by types C1 and D Clostridium botulinum (Morii, N., Sekine, A., Ohashi, Y., Nakao, K., Imura, H., Fujiwara, M., and Narumiya, S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12420-12426). In this study, we have identified the partial amino acid sequence of this protein. Purified Gb was digested with various proteases, and the proteolytic fragments were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. Isolated peptides were subjected to protein sequencing by an automated pulse-liquid phase protein sequenator. Eight partial amino acid sequences consisting of a total of 105 amino acid residues were obtained from 16 peptides. Computerized homology analysis revealed that they are homologous to the sequence deduced from cDNA of the rho genes. About 88% of the amino acid residues was identical between the sequenced Gb fragments and the corresponding regions of the Aplysia rho gene product. The result strongly suggests that Gb is a putative rho gene product."
https://openalex.org/W2068383483,"The immunoglobulin superfamily is a diverse group of proteins that are involved in various aspects of cell surface recognition. Here, we report the characterization of amalgam (ama), a gene in the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) of D. melanogaster that exhibits amino acid similarity to vertebrate neural cell adhesion molecules and other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The putative 333 amino acid ama protein consists of a signal sequence, three immunoglobulin-like domains, and a short slightly hydrophobic carboxy-terminal region. Antibodies against the ama protein reveal that it accumulates on the surface of various mesodermal and neural cells during embryogenesis. The function of this protein remains elusive, as no mutations have been recovered for ama during saturation EMS mutagenesis of this chromosomal region."
https://openalex.org/W1603561532,"Insulin modifies cellular responsiveness to some hormones which operate via guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins); also, G-proteins have been implicated in some actions of insulin. Using pertussis toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of Gi as an index of G-protein conformation, we evaluated interaction of insulin receptors with G-proteins. In isolated rat liver plasma membranes, insulin treatment for 10 min inhibited [32P]ADP-ribosylation of Gi by 50%. This effect was half-maximal at 2 x 10(-8) M. A similar effect was observed with rat adipocyte plasma membranes with half-maximal effect at 1 x 10(-8) M. Pertussis toxin activity itself was uninfluenced by insulin, as ribosylation of tubulin or heat-treated bovine serum albumin was unaltered. Elevated Mg2+ diminished basal ADP-ribosylation, but insulin inhibition occurred at all Mg2+ levels between 0 and 1 mM. Insulin inhibition was independent of ATP (20 microM to 10 mM), and GTP (0-100 microM) concentrations. Because both protein kinase C and purified insulin receptor phosphorylate purified Gi in vitro, we examined Gi as a substrate for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in vivo. Triton-extracts of isolated rat hepatocytes which had been 32Pi labeled and treated with insulin were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Gi antiserum. The dominant labeled phosphoprotein had a molecular weight of 42 kDa, consistent with the alpha-subunit of Gi, contained only phosphoserine, and was unaffected in its phosphorylation by insulin. These results indicate the existence of a novel pathway for physiological cross-talk between insulin and other hormones and further suggests that the insulin receptor may interact with regulatory G-proteins via biochemical mechanisms not directly involving the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2049951186,"S. cerevisae tRNA introns interrupt the gene at a constant position in the anticodon loop. Pre-tRNAs are matured by an endonuclease and a ligase. The endonuclease alone can accurately release the intron from the pre-tRNA. Here, we investigate the mechanism of splice site selection by the endonuclease. We propose that it initially recognizes features in the mature domain common to all tRNAs. Once positioned on the enzyme, the splice sites are recognizable because they are a fixed distance from the mature domain. To test this hypothesis, we developed a system for synthesizing pre-tRNA by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. To search for recognition sites, we made several mutations. Mutations of C56 and U8 strongly affect endonuclease recognition of pre-tRNA. With insertion and deletion mutations, we show that the anticodon stem determines splicing specificity. The sequence and structure of the intron are not strong determinants of splice site selection."
https://openalex.org/W2169861250,"Abstract Accumulation of inositol phosphates (Ins-Ps, revealed by high performance liquid chromatography), changes of the cytosolic free Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i, revealed by fura-2), membrane potential and ionic currents (revealed by bis-oxonol and patch clamping) were investigated in PC12 cells treated with bradykinin (BK). The phenomena observed were (a) due to the activation of a B2 receptor (inhibitor studies) and (b) unaffected by pertussis toxin, cAMP analogs, and inhibitors of either cyclooxygenase or voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. During the initial tens of s, three interconnected events predominated: accumulation of Ins-1,4,5-P3, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and hyperpolarization due to the opening of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Phorbol myristate acetate partially inhibited Ins-1,4,5-P3 accumulation at all [BK] investigated, and the [Ca2+]i increase at [BK] less than 50 nM. In PC12 cells treated with maximal [BK] in the Ca2+-containing incubation medium, Ins-1,4,5-P3 peaked at 10 s, dropped to 20% of the peak at 30 s, and returned to basal within 5 min; the peak increase of Ins-1,3,4-P3 was slower and was variable from experiment to experiment, while Ins-P4 rose for 2 min, and remained elevated for many min thereafter. Meanwhile, influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium, plasma membrane depolarization (visible without delay when hyperpolarization was blocked), and increased plasma membrane conductance were noticed. Evidence is presented that these last three events (which were partially inhibited by phorbol myristate acetate at all [BK]) were due to the activation of a cation influx, which was much more persistent than the elevation of the two Ins-P3 isomers. Our results appear inconsistent with the possibility that in intact PC12 cells the BK-induced activation of cation influx is accounted for entirely by the increases of either Ins-1,3,4-P3 or Ins-1,4,5-P3 (alone or in combination with Ins-1,3,4,5-P4), as previously suggested by microinjection studies in different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1510734305,"Two lectin-resistant mutants derived from a polarized epithelial cell line have been described (Meiss, H.K., Green, R.F., and Rodriguez-Boulan, E.J. (1982) Mol. Cell. Biol. 2, 1287-1294). One of these mutants, the Madin-Darby canine kidney strain II cell line resistant to Ricinus communis agglutinin (MDCKII-RCAr), has been further characterized, and the biochemical defect leading to its altered phenotype has been determined. MDCKII-RCAr cells are shown to be enriched in cell-surface glycoconjugates bearing terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues by in vitro exogalactosylation and by labeling with fluorescent lectins. Binding assays with a sialic acid-specific lectin reveal a 70-75% reduction in sialylation of cell-surface glycoconjugates. The defect is pleiotropic in nature, affecting glycoproteins as well as glycosphingolipids. Analysis of glycosphingolipids shows a strong reduction of galactose-containing glycosphingolipids. Almost 90% of the glycosphingolipids are identified as glucosyl-ceramide. The mutant is not deficient in galactosyl- and sialytransferase activities. However, Golgi vesicles isolated from MDCKII-RCAr cells translocate UDP-galactose at only 2% of the rate observed for vesicles from wild-type MDCKII cells. The deficiency is specific, because translocation rates of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and CMP-sialic acid are comparable for vesicles isolated from MDCKII-RCAr cells and wild-type cells. Despite the inability to translocate UDP-galactose into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, MDCKII-RCAr cells are able to form monolayers with normal apical and basolateral polarity as shown by plasma membrane domain-restricted exogalactosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1542114145,"Carbonyl reductase (EC 1.1.1.184) is one of several monomeric, NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases having wide specificity for carbonyl compounds that are generally referred to as the aldoketoreductases. The grouping of the enzyme into the family has been proposed on the basis of functional similarities and in the absence of structural data. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone complementary to human carbonyl reductase mRNA from a human placenta cDNA library constructed in phage lambda gt11. The cDNA consists of 1199 base pairs and contains an open reading frame encoding a protein comprised of 277 amino acids with a Mr of 30,375. The predicted amino acid sequence was confirmed by partial sequence analysis of the carbonyl reductase protein. Comparison of the protein sequence with the primary structures of other aldoketoreductases revealed no significant homologies. A possible homology, on the other hand, exists between carbonyl reductase and short subunit alcohol/polyol dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W1556438409,"We have separated at least six GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) with Mr values between 20,000 and 25,000 from bovine brain crude membranes (Kikuchi, A., Yamashita, T., Kawata, M., Yamamoto, K., Ideda, K., Tanimoto, T., and Takai, Y. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2897-2904). Three of these G proteins were copurified with the proteins ADP-ribosylated by botulinum toxin type C1. One G protein ADP-ribosylated by this toxin was identified to be the bovine brain rho protein (rho p20) which was purified to near homogeneity (Yamamoto, K., Kondo, J., Hishida, T., Teranishi, Y., and Takai, Y. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9926-9932). rho p20 was ADP-ribosylated by botulinum toxin type C1 in time- and dose-dependent manners. About 0.4 mol of ADP-ribose was maximally incorporated into 1 mol of rho p20. The ADP-ribosylation of rho p20 was dependent on the presence of Mg2+. GTP enhanced the ADP-ribosylation in the presence of a low concentration (50 nM) of Mg2+ but not in the presence of a high concentration (0.5 mM) of Mg2+. The high concentration of Mg2+ fully stimulated the ADP-ribosylation even in the absence of GTP. The ADP-ribosylation of rho p20 did not affect its GTP gamma S-binding and GTPase activities. These results indicate that there are at least three G proteins ADP-ribosylated by botulinum toxin type C1 in bovine brain crude membranes and that one of them is rho p20. Two other G proteins have not yet been identified, but neither the c-ras protein, ADP-ribosylation factor for Gs, nor a G protein with a Mr of 24,000 was ADP-ribosylated by this toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1521239469,"Gamete recognition in the mouse is mediated, in part, by the binding of sperm surface galactosyltransferase (GalTase) to appropriate substrates in the egg zona pellucida. In this paper, sperm GalTase is shown to be an externally oriented, integral plasma membrane component. GalTase is not peripherally adsorbed to the cell surface, nor is it bound to cell surface glycoside substrates. GalTase can be released from the surface of intact sperm by either mild proteolysis or by detergent under conditions in which the sperm membranes remain intact as judged by double-label indirect immunofluorescence. Detergent-solubilized sperm GalTase has been purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography and characterized as a beta 1,4-GlcNAc:GalTase by substrate and kinetic analyses. Purified and membrane-bound GalTase both show an unusual thermal inactivation above 39-40 degrees C, whereas other sperm enzyme activities as well as GalTase activity from other cell types are temperature-dependent. Purified sperm GalTase inhibits sperm binding to the egg zona pellucida, consistent with its proposed role during gamete recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1611126668,"Recombinant-derived human Factor VIII was labeled intrinsically with [35S]methionine, and its binding to washed human platelets was studied. Binding measurements were performed by incubating Factor VIII and platelets for 15 min at room temperature in Tyrode's solution supplemented with Ca2+ (5.0 mM), 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (5.0 mM), 0.50% bovine serum albumin, and the Factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylglutamylglycinylarginyl chloromethyl ketone and 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-arginine-N-(3-ethyl-1, 5-pentanediyl)amide. Separation of free from bound Factor VIII was accomplished by centrifugation through oil, and nonspecific binding was determined with excess unlabeled Factor VIII. Binding was saturable, reversible, and stimulated 20-fold after platelet activation with thrombin. Furthermore, binding was specific in that bound labeled Factor VIII could be displaced by excess unlabeled Factor VIII, but not by Factor V. Scatchard analysis indicated a single class of binding sites with Kd = 2.9 nM and 450 sites/activated platelet. The time course of displacement indicated a t1/2 of bound Factor VIII of approximately 5 min. When platelets were incubated in Ca2+, both the heavy and light chains of Factor VIII were bound, whereas exposure to EDTA resulted in the binding of the light chain only. These results demonstrate the specific reversible binding of Factor VIII to human platelets, likely mediated through the light chain."
https://openalex.org/W2026370903,"The class II (Ia) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens are a family of integral membrane proteins whose expression is limited to certain cell types. A pair of consensus sequences, X and Y, is found upstream of all class II genes, and deletion of each of these sequences eliminates expression of transfected genes. Furthermore, the absence of a specific X box binding protein in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease whose cells lack class II suggests an important role for these proteins in class II regulation. Here, the cloning of two λgt11 complementary DNAs encoding DNA binding proteins (murine X box binding proteins λmXBP and λmXBP-2) is reported. Both phage-encoded fusion proteins bind specifically to the X box of the Aα, but not to Eα or Eβ class II genes. These two independent isolates do not cross-hybridize. The λmXBP complementary DNA hybridizes to two RNA species, 6.2 and 3.0 kilobases in mouse, that are expressed in both Ia positive and Ia negative cells. By means of DNA blot analysis with the λmXBP complementary DNA insert and probes generated from each end of this complementary DNA insert, λmXBP was found to arise from a multigene family. These data illustrate the high degree of complexity in the transcriptional control of this coordinately regulated gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1587218958,"Abstract The mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (Complex I) is inhibited by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), and this inhibition correlates with incorporation of radioactivity from [14C]DCCD into a Complex I subunit of Mr 29,000 (Yagi, T. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 2822-2828). Resolution of [14C]DCCD-labeled Complex I in the presence of NaClO4 showed that the labeled Mr 29,000 subunit was in the hydrophobic fraction of the enzyme. This fraction, which contains greater than 17 unlike polypeptides, was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the Mr 29,000 subunit, containing bound [14C]DCCD, was isolated and purified. The amino acid composition and partial sequence of this subunit corresponded to those predicted from the mitochondrial DNA for the product of the mtDNA gene designated ND-1. The identity of the Mr 29,000 subunit with the ND-1 gene product was further confirmed by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments, using the hydrophobic fraction of [14C]DCCD-labeled Complex I and antiserum to a C-terminal undecapeptide synthesized on the basis of the human mitochondrial ND-1 nucleotide sequence. Thus, it appears that the DCCD-binding subunits of the respiratory chain Complexes I, III, and IV and in certain organisms the DCCD-binding subunit of the ATP synthase complex (Complex V) are all mtDNA products."
https://openalex.org/W1527935982,"The enzyme that catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation and concomitant inactivation of dinitrogenase reductase in Rhodospirillum rubrum has been purified greater than 19,000-fold to near homogeneity. We propose dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase (DRAT) as the working name for the enzyme. DRAT activity is stabilized by NaCl and ADP. The enzyme is a monomer with a molecular mass of 30 kDa and is a different polypeptide than dinitrogenase reductase activating glycohydrolase. NAD (Km = 2 mM), etheno-NAD, nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide, and nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide will serve as donor molecules in DRAT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation reaction, and dinitrogenase reductases from R. rubrum, Azotobacter vinelandii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Clostridium pasteurianium will serve as acceptors. No other proteins or small molecules, including water, have been found to be effective as acceptors. Nicotinamide is released stoichiometrically with formation of the ADP-ribosylated product. DRAT is inhibited by NaCl and has maximal activity at a pH of 7.0."
https://openalex.org/W1560419760,"We have investigated the phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein which may be on the pathway of mitogenic stimulation in response to oxidants. Mouse epidermal cells JB6 (clone 41) were exposed to active oxygen generated extracellularly by glucose/glucose oxidase (producing H2O2) or xanthine oxidase (producing H2O2 plus superoxide) or active oxygen produced intracellularly by the metabolism of menadione (producing mostly superoxide). All three sources of active oxygen induced rapidly a protein kinase activity which phosphorylated S6 in cellular extracts prepared in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor beta-glycerophosphate. Maximal activity was reached within 15 min of exposure, and phosphorylation occurred specifically at serine residues. Strong activation of the protein kinase activity was also observed by diamide which selectively oxidizes SH functions. The following observations characterize the reaction: 1) Extracellular addition of catalase but not Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase was inhibitory, implicating H2O2 rather than superoxide as the active species. 2) Exposure of JB6 cells to reagent H2O2 or H2O2 released by glucose/glucose oxidase resulted in a measurable increase in intracellular free Ca2+. 3) The intracellular Ca2+ complexer quin 2 suppressed the reaction. 4) The calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine prevented the activation of the protein kinase. 5) Exposure of cells to Mn2+ and La3+, which stimulate calmodulin-dependent activities, potently increased the S6 kinase activity of the cell extracts. 6) Desalted extracts strictly required the addition of Mg2+ and their activity was inhibited by Mn2+. In contrast, the phosphorylation of a 95-kDa protein was strongly stimulated by Mn2+. 7) For several agonists, i.e. active oxygen, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and serum, tryptic peptide analysis yielded the same phosphopeptides, suggesting that a common S6 kinase is involved in these reactions. From these data we propose that oxidants induce an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ which activates a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and, as a consequence, an S6 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1594823104,"Incubation of tail tendon from a young rat in solutions containing D-ribose resulted in attachment of the monosaccharide to collagen and subsequent cross-link formation at a rate much faster than found for glucose. The collagen rapidly became resistant to solubilization and showed increasing fluorescence. Ribose bound to all major CNBr peptides of collagen, with some preference for the alpha 2-CB3,5 peptide and the triple-helical region of alpha 1-CB6, and was incorporated into higher molecular weight material. Extensive pepsin digestion permitted isolation of dimers of alpha chains cross-linked in triple-helical regions as a result of incubation with ribose. The dimers were identified as beta 11, beta 12, and beta 22 components, and the limited degree of heterogeneity of these components indicated that cross-linking occurred at several sites, some of which must be intermolecular. Isolated beta components were strongly fluorescent with a spectrum similar to that of collagen in aged tissues. Fluorescent dimers with similar characteristics were found in pepsin digests of tail tendons from older rats."
https://openalex.org/W1629568153,"When corneal microsomes were incubated with arachidonic acid in the presence of an NADPH-generating system, two biologically active metabolites of arachidonic acid were formed. The structure of one of the metabolites, compound C, was previously reported to be 12(R)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid and was found to be a potent inhibitor of the Na+/K+-ATPase in the cornea. The second metabolite, compound D, was found to be a potent vasodilator as well as having the property of stimulating protein influx into the aqueous humor of the eye. Following purification of compound D by thin layer chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography, it was found to lack a UV chromophore in contrast to the previously reported cytochrome P-450-dependent metabolite. Mass spectrometric analysis using positive and negative ionization modes was carried out on derivatized compound D that had been synthesized from a mixture of labeled [( 5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-2H8]) and unlabeled arachidonic acid incubated with corneal microsomes. The novel arachidonate metabolite had abundant fragment ions consistent with compound D being a monooxygenated derivative of arachidonic acid with a hydroxyl substituent at carbon 12 of the eicosanoid backbone; only seven deuterium atoms from [2H8]arachidonate were retained in the structure. Oxidative ozonolysis yielded a product indicating that the double bonds in metabolite D resided between carbons at positions 8 and 9 and positions 14 and 15 of the 20-carbon chain. Compound D was therefore characterized as 12-hydroxy-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid. Model compounds were synthesized from dimethyl malate with the hydroxy at the 12 position with both the R and S absolute configuration and with all double bonds of the cis configuration. Only the 12(R) isomer was found to be a potent vasodilator and to increase aqueous humor protein concentration, suggesting that the biologically active compound D was 12(R)-hydroxy-5,8,14-(Z,Z,Z)-eicosatrienoic acid. As this compound possesses proinflammatory properties, it may play a role in the wound-healing processes of corneal injury."
https://openalex.org/W1581577100,"GTP-binding proteins were purified from human neutrophils, including a 40,000-Da pertussis toxin substrate (Gn) and 22,000-, 24,000-, and 26,000-Da proteins, termed G22K, G24K, and G26K, respectively. The latter proteins were shown to be immunologically unrelated to Gn. G22K cross-reacted with anti-ras monoclonal antibody 142-24EO5, but not with monoclonal antibody Y13-259. A single 22,000-Da substrate for botulinum toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation present in neutrophil membranes co-migrated upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with G22K. In the presence of a cytosolic factor, G22K could serve as a specific botulinum toxin substrate. The 22,000-Da botulinum toxin substrate in neutrophil membranes could be immunoprecipitated by antibody 142-24EO5, but not by antibody Y13-259.

Immediately following an activation signal, there is fragmentation of a spectrin-rich cytoplasmic structure and subsequent translocation of the fragments to defined areas of the plasma membrane in both antigen-specific T cell hybridomas and lymph node T cells. These dramatic changes have been documented by light and electron microscopic immunolocalization and by immunoblot analysis of plasma membrane-enriched preparations. A T cell hybridoma variant lacking the spectrin-rich cytoplasmic structure of the parental line does not redistribute spectrin and produces little or no IL-2 in response to antigen-dependent activation. This suggests a functional link between spectrin distribution and activation potential. We propose that the cytoplasmic structure functions as an organizing center or reservoir for spectrin that is sensitive to signaling at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1564163807,"Abstract We have recently reported (Ransnas, L.A., and Insel, P.A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9482-9485) development of antipeptide antibodies to the alpha s protein of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein, Gs, and use of one of these antibodies, GS-1, to quantitate Gs levels in S49 lymphoma cell membranes. Another of these antibodies, termed GS-2, appears to detect only dissociated alpha s, but not the heterotrimer alpha s beta gamma. Using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we have found that the guanine nucleotides GTP and guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) (but not GDP) and the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol activate Gs in native S49 cell membrane by subunit dissociation. Evidence for this includes detection of dissociated alpha s in membrane extracts and release of alpha s from S49 cell membranes treated with GTP gamma S or isoproterenol. Moreover, the estimates of apparent stoichiometry for this dissociation indicate that each beta-adrenergic receptor is able to activate greater than or equal to 100 molecules of Gs in native membranes. Thus, receptor-mediated dissociation of Gs is likely to be the major site of amplification of signal transduction by agonists active at hormone receptors that link to Gs."
https://openalex.org/W1607350486,"The antithrombin-binding region in heparin is a pentasaccharide sequence with the predominant structure GlcNAc(6-OSO3)-GlcA-GlcNSO3(3,6-di-OSO3)-IdoA -(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) (where GlcA and IdoA represent D-glucuronic and L-iduronic acid, respectively), in which the 3-O-sulfate residue on the internal glucosaminyl unit is a marker group for this particular region of the polysaccharide molecule. A heparin octasaccharide which contained the above pentasaccharide sequence was N/O-desulfated and re-N-sulfated and was then incubated with adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phospho[35S]sulfate in the presence of a microsomal fraction from mouse mastocytoma tissue. Fractionation of the resulting 35S-labeled octasaccharide on antithrombin-Sepharose yielded a high affinity fraction that accounted for approximately 2% of the total incorporated label. Structural analysis of this fraction indicated that the internal glucosamine unit of the pentasaccharide sequence was 3-O-35S-sulfated, whereas both adjacent glucosamine units carried 6-O-[35S]sulfate groups. In contrast, the fractions with low affinity for antithrombin (approximately 98% of incorporated 35S) showed no consistent O-35S sulfation pattern and essentially lacked glucosaminyl 3-O-[35S]sulfate groups. It is suggested that the 3-O-sulfation reaction concludes the formation of the antithrombin-binding region. This proposal was corroborated in a similar experiment using a synthetic pentasaccharide with the structure GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-GlcA-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-Id oA (2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3) as sulfate acceptor. This molecule corresponds to a functional antithrombin-binding region but for the lack of a 3-O-sulfate group at the internal glucosamine unit. The 35S-labeled pentasaccharide recovered after incubation bound with high affinity to antithrombin-Sepharose and contained a 3-O-[35S]sulfate group at the internal glucosamine residue as the only detectable labeled component. The use of this pentasaccharide substrate along with the affinity matrix provides a highly specific assay for the 3-O-sulfotransferase."

The soluble fraction of PC12 cells contains two S6 kinases, separable on heparin-Sepharose. Treatment of the cells with nerve growth factor results in an increase in the activity of one of these kinases; treatment of the cells with epidermal growth factor results in an increase in the activity of the other one. The data suggest that the patterns of phosphorylation and, in turn, the functional properties of S6 are different in cells instructed to differentiate from those in cells instructed to divide."
https://openalex.org/W2092700608,"An unexpected immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, signal sequence replacement, was observed in which the recombinational signal sequences of a VH gene segment are fused intact to the 5' end of a DJH element. Nucleotides are not lost from the signal sequences, but they may be lost from the DJH coding sequence. Signal sequence replacement may result from the alternative resolution of an intermediate in VH-to-DJH recombination. This type of rearrangement provides a means to alter the targeting of immunoglobulin gene segments and suggests a mechanism for the occurrence of VH-JH junctions in vivo. Signal sequence replacement may represent an additional pathway for the generation of antibody diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1585615702,"Human collagen type IX was isolated from the media of organ cultures of fetal or infant hyaline cartilage. It consisted of three distinct, disulfide-bonded polypeptides of 115, 84, and 72 kDa, respectively. Digestion with chondroitinase ABC reduced the apparent molecular mass of the 115-kDa chain to about 65 kDa demonstrating that also human collagen type IX is a proteoglycan. In the electron microscope, the molecule had a rigid rod-like structure with characteristic kinks and with a globular domain at one end. Digestion of human collagen type IX with pepsin leads to somewhat heterogeneous fragments. Affinity-purified antibodies to the mixture of fragments specifically reacted with the fragment HMW without cross-reaction with chicken HMW. LMW of both species were recognized to the same low extent. Mechanically generated fibril fragments from human fetal cartilage were heterogeneous in diameter. Significantly, they could be immunostained for collagen type IX in a D-periodic pattern and regardless of the fibril diameter. Some fibrils were poorly labeled, again independently of the diameter. Therefore, the role of collagen type IX in cartilage probably is not to control directly the lateral growth during fibrillogenesis but rather to stabilize the fibril network."

One of the subunits, with a molecular mass of about 16 kDa, was isolated, and protein sequence information was obtained for the amino terminus and several tryptic peptides. Oligonucleotide probes, corresponding to these sequences, were used to probe a genomic library, and the gene, designated psaD, encoding subunit II was cloned and sequenced. The gene encodes a polypeptide with a mass 15,644 Da, which exhibits a high degree of similarity to subunit II from tomato, as well as amino acid sequences reported from barley photosystem I. In addition to this gene, three large open reading frames were identified. Two remain unidentified, and the third is highly homologous to anthranilate synthase, component 1 from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W1525288641,"The biochemical basis for the complex effects of the anti-cancer drug cisplatin on hepatic cytochrome P-450 activity was studied in adult male rat liver using P-450 form-specific steroid hydroxylase assays and antibody probes. Cisplatin treatment of adult male rats resulted in a marked and prolonged feminization of the pattern of P-450 enzymes expressed in hepatic tissue. The adult male-specific cytochrome P-450 forms designated P-450 2c (P-450 gene IIC11), P-450 2a (gene IIIA2), and P-450 RLM2 were decreased by 70-90% after 7-14 days, with parallel decreases in their respectively associated microsomal steroid hydroxylase activities. Concomitantly, hepatic levels of the female-predominant enzymes P-450 3 (gene IIA1) and P-450j (gene IIE1) were elevated approximately 2-4-fold. The female-specific microsomal enzyme androstenedione 5 alpha-reductase was induced approximately 20-fold by cisplatin; however, no elevation of the female-specific P-450 2d was detected. The underlying hormonal basis for these effects of cisplatin was then examined. Serum testosterone levels were found to be depleted by cisplatin in a time- and dose-dependent manner which correlated with the observed changes in these hepatic enzymes. Furthermore, castration of adult rats altered the profile of these enzymes in a manner which resembled that observed with cisplatin treatment, suggesting that androgen depletion was the primary cause for the observed feminization of hepatic enzyme expression. Consistent with this possibility, the synthetic androgen methyltrienolone effectively blocked the changes in hepatic enzyme expression induced by cisplatin. Moreover, hepatic enzyme feminization was significantly reversed by chorionic gonadotropin, which fully restored serum testosterone levels in the cisplatin-treated rat. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone challenge experiments demonstrated that the responsiveness of the pituitary to this hypothalamic regulator of testicular androgen production was unimpaired by cisplatin treatment, indicating that hypothalamic production or secretion of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone may be deficient in the cisplatin-treated animals. These studies establish that the effects of cisplatin on hepatic P-450 enzyme expression result from its interruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary stimulation of testicular androgen production and that this, in turn, leads to a depletion of circulating androgens required for maintenance of normal P-450 enzyme expression in adult male rats."
https://openalex.org/W1541028334,"The role of Asn-linked oligosaccharide in the functional properties of both human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and a genetic variant of t-PA was studied. Nonglycosylated and glycosylated wild-type t-PA were produced in mammalian cells which express recombinant t-PA. These proteins were compared in fibrin binding and 125I-labeled fibrin clot lysis assays, using purified components. The nonglycosylated form showed higher fibrin binding, as well as higher fibrinolytic potency than the glycosylated form. Subsequently, prevention of glycosylation of a t-PA variant which lacked the finger and epidermal growth factor domains (delta FE), was carried out in an attempt to enhance its fibrinolytic activity. Glycosylation was prevented by changing Asn to Gln; at Asn-117 to produce delta FE1X t-PA, and at Asn-117, -184, and -448 to produce delta FE3X t-PA. All variants were similar to wild-type t-PA in their catalytic dependence on fibrinogen fragments, fibrinolytic activity in fibrin autography analysis, and plasminogen activator activity. In a clot lysis assay, using citrated human plasma, the fibrinolytic potency of the variants were comparable to that of wild-type t-PA at activator concentrations of 17-51 nM (approximately 1-3 micrograms/ml). At 0.5-5.1 nM (approximately 0.03-0.3 micrograms/ml), however, the variant proteins had lower fibrinolytic potency than wild-type t-PA. Fifty percent lysis in 1.5 h for wild-type, delta FE, delta FE1X, and delta FE3X t-PA, required 2.5, 10, 7.5, and 5.5 nM t-PA, respectively. The fibrinogenolytic activity in human plasma was measured for wild-type, delta FE, delta FE1X, and delta FE3X t-PA, and showed significant fibrinogen depletion after 3 h of incubation at 51 nM, decreasing to 11, 11, 50, and 72% of basal levels, respectively. These data indicate that partial or total nonglycosylated t-PA variants have a higher fibrinolytic versus fibrinogenolytic ratio than their fully glycosylated counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W1484987902,"The post-translational formation of hypusine (N epsilon-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) occurs in a precursor of eukaryotic initiation factor 4D by way of two major steps: 1) transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety from spermidine to the epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine residue to form an intermediate, deoxyhypusine; 2) hydroxylation of the deoxyhypusine residue to form hypusine. The initial step of this modification, deoxyhypusine synthesis, was studied in fractionated lysates of Chinese hamster ovary cells, untreated, or treated with alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO); the enzyme(s) and the protein substrate (eukaryotic initiation factor 4D precursor) were separated. The enzyme activity was found in the 0-45% ammonium sulfate fraction from both untreated and DFMO-treated cells. The protein substrate was detected in the 45-75% ammonium sulfate fraction from cells depleted of spermidine by treatment with DFMO, but not in any fraction from untreated cells. Upon further purification of the protein substrate by ion exchange chromatography, the requirement for a pyridine nucleotide, notably NAD+, became apparent. Free 1,3-diaminopropane was identified as a spermidine cleavage product formed concurrently with the 4-aminobutyl transfer step of deoxyhypusine synthesis. Compounds structurally related to spermidine, e.g. caldine, N4-benzylspermidine, homospermidine, and a spermine homologue, thermine, as well as 1,7-diaminoheptane, 1,8-diaminooctane, and 1,9-diaminononane caused significant inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthesis presumably due to competition with spermidine. 1,3-Diaminopropane exhibited a potent inhibition of deoxyhypusine formation, probably through a different mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1625674924,"Employing [32P]ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin we have identified a G protein that is located in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of canine pancreas and therefore termed it GRER. Identification of GRER is based on the following data. A 41-kDa polypeptide was the only polypeptide that was [32P]ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin in pancreas rough microsomes. Guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) and 1 mM ATP, 6 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaF (AMF) inhibited ADP-ribosylation of this polypeptide. The [32P]ADP-ribosylated 41-kDa polypeptide was immunoprecipitated by antisera which specifically recognized the C-terminal residues of the alpha subunits of Gi and transducin, indicating that the 41-kDa polypeptide is immunologically related to the alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Treatment with GTP gamma S resulted in a reduction in the sedimentation rate of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated, detergent-solubilized GRER. It also induced the release of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated 41-kDa polypeptide from rough microsomes in the absence of detergent, unlike ADP-ribosylated alpha subunits of plasma membrane-associated G proteins. These data are consistent with an oligomeric nature of GRER. The codistribution of GRER with an endoplasmic reticulum marker protein during subcellular fractionation and the lack of plasma membrane contamination of the rough microsomal fraction, combined with the isodensity of GRER with rough microsomes as well as the isodensity of GRER with stripped microsomes after extraction of rough microsomes with EDTA and 0.5 M KCl, localized GRER to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Preliminary experiments suggest that GRER appears not to be involved in translocation of proteins across the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2025944706,"In some reptiles, egg incubation temperature determines whether the embryo hatches as male or female; in others, sex chromosomes determine sex. A cloned gene (ZFY) representing the putative testis-determining factor in mammals was hybridized to genomic DNA of reptiles with sex chromosomes and to DNA of reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination. No sex differences in hybridization patterns were observed. Hybridization of ZFY to polyadenylated RNA indicates that reptilian versions of this gene are expressed in embryos of both sexes during the temperature-sensitive period. If these highly conserved sequences are important in reptilian sex determination, then temperature-dependent and genotypic sex determination may have a similar molecular basis. For reptiles with XX/XY or ZZ/ZW systems, the absence of sex differences in hybridization patterns raises the question of whether the ZFY sequences reside on their sex chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1512387589,"Abstract Human antithrombin III (AT) shares significant sequence homology and a common inhibitory mechanism with the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. AT has a reactive site in which the P1 residue is primarily responsible for protease specificity. The P1' residue, almost invariably serine, is critical in the inactive natural variant AT-Denver, which has a leucine substitution in that position (Stephens, A.W., Thalley, B.S., and Hirs, C.H.W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1044-1048). In the present study site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate eight variants with altered P1' residues. All were secreted efficiently by COS cells transiently transfected with the AT cDNA in a eukaryotic shuttle vector. All variants also bound heparin as effectively as wild-type AT. Variants were grouped into three categories with respect to thrombin-AT complex formation: 1) no detectable inhibitory activity (proline, methionine); 2) low activity (cysteine, valine, leucine); and 3) near normal activity (glycine, alanine, threonine). The leucine variant, which is in the low activity group, exhibited the same physical and functional properties as AT-Denver. We conclude that the serine hydroxyl is not critical for functional activity and that there is a side chain size optimum which is modulated by hydrophobic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2088358369,"Enhancer sequences control the expression of the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain gene. In this study we examined whether the active transcriptional state of the mu gene can be propagated from mother to daughter cells after deletion of its enhancer. A mu gene that contains the enhancer flanked by D and J recombination signals was stably introduced into pre-B cells, resulting in mu gene transcription. Subsequent deletion of the enhancer from the transfected gene by D-to-J joining reproducibly resulted in switching off of mu expression. Moreover, transcriptional inactivation occurred although the mu gene was found to be hypomethylated prior to deletion of the enhancer. We conclude that the enhancer does not confer upon the mu gene ""memory"" of its active transcriptional state. Thus, the enhancer seems to be required both for establishment and for maintenance of mu gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1549068729,"Rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone prohormone (pro-TRH) contains five separate copies of the TRH progenitor sequence: Gln-His-Pro-Gly. Each of the five sequences is flanked by pairs of basic residues and linked together by one of several predicted connecting sequences. Two of the pro-TRH-connecting peptides, prepro-TRH-(160-169) and prepro-TRH-(178-199), were detected in extracts of rat neural tissues by radioimmunoassay using antibodies directed against the corresponding synthetic probes. Endogenous prepro-TRH-(160-169) and prepro-TRH-(178-199) were purified by gel exclusion chromatography, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography. Structural identification of each peptide was achieved by chromatographic comparison with synthetic standards, immunological analysis, and tryptic mapping. Equimolar amounts of these connecting fragments were observed in hypothalamus and spinal cord. Quantification of TRH in spinal cord and hypothalamus extracts revealed the presence of 4.9-6.3 mol of TRH/mol of prepro-TRH-(178-199) and 4.4-6 mol of TRH/mol of prepro-TRH-(160-169), respectively. By using the indirect immunofluorescence technique, prepro-TRH-(178-199) immunoreactive cell bodies were found in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and a dense plexus of immunopositive nerve terminals was observed in the external zone of the median eminence, in a distribution similar to that described for TRH. These studies demonstrate that prepro-TRH-(160-169) and prepro-TRH-(178-199) are, together with TRH, predominant storage forms of the TRH precursor in hypothalamus and spinal cord, being present in molar ratios corresponding to those expected for a nearly complete processing of the prohormone molecule. The presence of pro-TRH-connecting peptides in various brain regions, including the median eminence, suggests that these peptides might act as neuromodulators in the central nervous system and/or neuroendocrine signals at the pituitary level. In the olfactory lobes, prepro-TRH is processed differently since a C-terminally extended form of TRH, prepro-TRH-(172-199), is found as a major end product along with lower but significant amounts of prepro-TRH-(178-199) and prepro-TRH-(160-169). The striking difference in pro-TRH processing patterns among the various tissues examined suggests differential regulating mechanisms for TRH and/or TRH-related activities."
https://openalex.org/W1506293995,"Abstract In the present studies, we attempted to purify the native molecular forms of the c-ras proteins (c-ras p21s) from bovine brain crude membranes and separated at least three GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) cross-reactive with the antibody recognizing all of Ha-, Ki-, and N-ras p21s. Among them, one G protein with a Mr of about 21,000 was highly purified and characterized. The Mr 21,000 G protein bound maximally about 0.6 mol of [35S]guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S)/mol of protein with a Kd value of about 30 nM. [35S]GTP gamma S-binding to Mr 21,000 G protein was inhibited by GTP and GDP, but not by other nucleotides such as ATP, UTP, and CTP. [35S]GTP gamma S-binding to Mr 21,000 G protein was inhibited by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide. Mr 21,000 G protein hydrolyzed GTP to liberate Pi with a turnover number of about 0.01 min-1. Mr 21,000 G protein was not copurified with the beta gamma subunits of the G proteins regulatory for adenylate cyclase. Mr 21,000 G protein was not recognized by the antibody against the ADP-ribosylation factor for Gs. The peptide map of Mr 21,000 G protein was different from those of the G proteins with Mr values of 25,000 and 20,000, designated as smg p25A and rho p20, respectively, which we have recently purified from bovine brain crude membranes. The partial amino acid sequence of Mr 21,000 G protein was identical with that of human c-Ki-ras 2B p21. These results indicate that Mr 21,000 G protein is bovine brain c-Ki-ras 2B p21 and that c-Ki-ras 2B p21 is present in bovine brain membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1563079688,"Many cellular and retroviral protein-tyrosine kinases display either a requirement or a preference for manganese over magnesium for maximal activity. We have observed that peptides and proteins are non-enzymatically phosphorylated at tyrosine and serine by ATP when heated in the presence of MnCl2 at neutral pH. The extent of the reaction is negligible below 50 degrees C but increases rapidly at higher temperatures. The reaction proceeds in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate but is blocked by EDTA. No reaction is observed in the absence of Mn2+, even if Mg2+ is present. Manganese therefore acts as a catalyst for the non-enzymatic reaction, but magnesium does not. We propose that the preference for manganese shown by many protein tyrosine kinases is due at least in part to the intrinsic ability of Mn2+ to catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to a phosphate acceptor such as tyrosine. The nonenzymatic phosphorylation reaction also offers a new synthetic pathway for the preparation of radiolabeled peptides containing phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine."
https://openalex.org/W1584553304,"Lysates from normally growing (25 degrees C) or heat shocked (37 degrees C, 45 min) Drosophila melanogaster embryos were obtained and the effect of analogues of the mRNA 5'-terminal cap, m7G(5')ppp(5')N structure and of potassium ions on their endogenous protein synthesis activity was studied. At optimal concentration of KCH3COO (75-80 mM), protein synthesis in normal lysates is strongly inhibited by cap analogues (m7GpppG, m7GDP, and m7GMP). At the same ionic conditions, heat shock lysates translate preferentially the heat shock messengers, and this translation is almost unaffected by the cap analogues. In contrast, residual synthesis of normal proteins in heat shock lysates was reduced by these compounds. By lowering the concentration of potassium ions it was possible to gradually reverse the inhibitory effect of the cap analogues in normal lysates and also to increase specifically the translation of normal mRNAs in heat shock lysates. Translation of normal mRNAs is also partial but specifically rescued by supplementing heat shock lysates with polypeptide chain initiation factors partially purified from rabbit reticulocytes. These data are consistent with the notion that the failure of normal mRNAs to be translated under heat shock conditions might be due, at least to some extent, to the inactivation of polypeptide chain initiation factor(s) involved in the recognition of the mRNA 5'-terminal cap structure."
https://openalex.org/W1604712238,"Abstract Adenyl-32P-Labeled 3'-deoxy-NAD+ was utilized as a substrate by pure DNA-dependent poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (EC 2.4.2.30) from calf thymus in the automodification reaction with an apparent Km of 20 microM and a Vmax of 80 nmol/min/mg of protein. Analysis by lithium lauryl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single 32P-labeled protein of 116-kDa which comigrated with automodified enzyme. Addition of increasing amounts of histone H1 up to a concentration of 15 micrograms/ml stimulated the synthesis of protein-bound polymers of 3'-deoxy-ADP-ribose. However, the average polymer size was equal to 2 in the presence and 4 in the absence of histone H1, respectively. The synthesis of protein-bound oligomers of 3'-deoxy-ADP-ribose was inhibited by the polymerase inhibitors benzamide, nicotinamide, thymidine, and NaCl. A pulse labeling of polymer synthesis with 40 microM [32P]3'-deoxy-NAD+ either in the presence or absence of 15 micrograms/ml of histone H1, followed by a chase with 1 mM [3H]NAD+, was used to determine the mechanism of poly(ADP-ribose) elongation. Following enzyme digestion of these polymers with phosphodiesterase, it was found that 52 and 24% of the total 32P radiolabel was associated with the 3'-deoxy-AMP termini of the polymers synthesized in the pulse reactions, in the presence or absence of histone H1, respectively. In contrast, less than 10% of the total radioactivity was associated with 3'-deoxy-AMP in the product of the chase reactions. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the initially attached residue of 3'-deoxy-ADP-ribose to either the polymerase or histone H1, is elongated by the protein-distal addition of ADP-ribose residues to the AMP terminus of the growing polymer chain."
https://openalex.org/W1514351005,"Hybrid genes were constructed. One, ompA153-dfr, encoded the precursor of the 325 residue Escherichia coli outer membrane protein OmpA up to residue 153 which was fused to the complete 186-residue dihydrofolate reductase of the mouse. The other, ompA219-lacZ, coded for the same precursor up to residue 219 which was fused to 1017 COOH-terminal residues of the 1023-residue subunit of the beta-galactosidase of E. coli. Full expression of the ompA153-dfr gene caused accumulation of its precursor and of that of the chromosomally encoded OmpA protein. When the amount of product was reduced, no pro-OmpA and very little pro-hybrid protein accumulated. The precursor was processed and the mature protein was fully accessible to trypsin in permeabilized cells. Expression of the ompA219-lacZ gene led to the presence of the hybrid protein at only 20-30% of the amount expected. About 20% of it appeared to be incorporated in the outer membrane. All of the hybrid was quantitatively accessible to trypsin in permeabilized cells. When the hybrid gene was overexpressed, the protein was found associated with the plasma membrane in the cytosol. It is concluded that both beta-galactosidase and dihydrofolate reductase could quantitatively traverse the plasma membrane, provided the amounts synthesized were sufficiently small."
https://openalex.org/W1549467326,"Cultures of myocytes from embryonic chick atria grown in medium supplemented with fetal calf serum from which lipoproteins had been removed demonstrated a nearly 10-fold increase in sensitivity of beating to the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine compared to cells grown with control serum. This effect was reversed by growth of cells in medium supplemented with lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS) reconstituted with the low density lipoprotein fraction from fetal calf serum. In cells grown in LPDS, total cell cholesterol was increased 32% over control levels and returned to control levels in cells grown with LPDS reconstituted with low density lipoprotein. Growth of cells in LPDS plus mevinolin, an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, also reversed the effects of LPDS on cholesterol content and sensitivity of beating to carbamylcholine. The ability of mevinolin (30 microM) to reverse the effect of LPDS on sensitivity of beating to carbamylcholine was inhibited by mevalonic acid, a metabolic precursor to cholesterol, with an IC50 of 7 x 10(-5) M. These data suggest that mevinolin reverses the effects of LPDS by altering cellular cholesterol levels. Enhanced responsiveness of embryonic chick heart cells to muscarinic stimulation was associated with a 2-fold increase in the number of muscarinic receptors with high affinity for agonist from 82 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein in media containing fetal calf serum to 175 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein in cells grown in the presence of LPDS. The distribution of receptors between high affinity (RH) and low affinity (RL) forms changed from 41% RH and 59% RL in cells grown in control serum to 66.5% RH and 33.5% RL in cells grown in LPDS. Quantitation of the effect of growth in LPDS on the levels of guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins No and Ni which couple the muscarinic receptor to a physiologic response, demonstrated that the relative levels of the 39-kDa alpha subunits of No and 41-kDa alpha subunits of Ni determined by ADP ribosylation with pertussis toxin and immunoblotting increased 2-fold compared to control cells grown with fetal calf serum. Growth of cells with medium supplemented with LPDS plus mevinolin reduced the levels of alpha 39 and alpha 41 to below the levels in control cells. Levels of the beta subunit of No and Ni were unaffected by growth with LPDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1549103910,"Externally added calmodulin (CaM) restored Ca2+ regulation for the tension development by skeletal muscle fibers of hamster and rabbit desensitized by the troponin C (TnC) extraction treatment. CaM produced this action by combining with the TnC-denuded sites in the fiber. However, the binding properties differed strikingly from TnC: unlike TnC, CaM binding required the continued presence of Ca2+ and the bound portion was completely released with EGTA in the physiological milieu. The maximal uptake was 1.7 g of CaM/kg of muscle in the present study. The apparent Ca2+ sensitivity for force development with 200 micrograms/ml CaM in the solution was lower than in the native fiber or in the TnC-loaded fiber. The apparent association constant for CaM binding to the TnC-denuded sites was found as 4.9 x 10(5) M-1, and the extrapolated maximum force (Fmax) with CaM was close to PO. The intrinsic CaM level in intact muscle was also measured and was 18.6 mg/kg, amounting to about 1% of the total TnC or the CaM uptake by TnC-denuded fibers. The intrinsic CaM was not dislodged by EDTA treatment, indicating tight binding and suggesting that it exists in a separate pool from the vacated TnC sites adsorbing externally added CaM. The stringent Ca+ dependence of the CaM adsorption to TnC sites in the regulatory complex in the fiber supports the view that the evolutionary replacement of residues in the amino terminus helix portion of the EF-hand motif of site IV may be critical for the functional specialization by TnC."
https://openalex.org/W1594256551,"The mass of total arachidonate released from phospholipids upon agonist stimulation of the cell and the fraction of released arachidonate which is converted to icosanoids are two parameters of arachidonate metabolism which have been difficult to quantitate because the mass of arachidonate released upon cell stimulation is very low. We have been able to quantitate both of these parameters under a variety of experimental conditions using a unique essential fatty acid-deficient mouse fibrosarcoma cell line (EFD-1), which when repleted with arachidonate, produces prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Because there is no endogenous pool of arachidonate in these cells, the specific activity of exogenous arachidonate does not change upon incorporation into cells, an advantage which permits mass determination of very small quantities of arachidonate directly from radioactive counts. EFD-1 cells were incubated with various concentrations of [14C]arachidonate (for release studies) or unlabeled arachidonate (for PGE2 radioimmunoassays) for 24 h and then stimulated with bradykinin. The time courses for arachidonate release and PGE2 production demonstrated that free arachidonate was rapidly converted to PGE2 with plateau levels attained for both parameters within 240 s of agonist exposure for 2 microM and for 10 microM arachidonate-repleted cultures. There was a linear relationship (r = 0.94) between the mass of arachidonate in the cell and the mass of arachidonate released upon stimulation, up to a cellular concentration of 11 nmol of arachidonate/10(6) cells, a concentration 10-20% above normal for the parent mouse fibrosarcoma cell line (HSDM1C1) which is not essential fatty acid-deficient. Importantly, the percent of released arachidonate which was converted to PGE2 decreased from 90 to 15% with increasing concentrations of cellular arachidonate, because PGE2 production plateaued at greater than or equal to 6 nmol of arachidonate/10(6) cells, but total arachidonate release continued to rise. Finally, we demonstrated that agonist stimulation with thrombin, A23187, and bradykinin all showed the same percent conversion of released arachidonate to PGE2, implying that the determination of this fraction is not a function of the mechanism of release. These studies with our unique cell line indicate that, when the concentration of arachidonate in the cell is not elevated above amounts normally found in our HSDM1C1 cell line, released arachidonate is rapidly and almost quantitatively converted to PGE2, independent of the agonist used to stimulate the cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
