https://openalex.org/W2899608158,"Lighting accounts for one-fifth of global electricity consumption1. Single materials with efficient and stable white-light emission are ideal for lighting applications, but photon emission covering the entire visible spectrum is difficult to achieve using a single material. Metal halide perovskites have outstanding emission properties2,3; however, the best-performing materials of this type contain lead and have unsatisfactory stability. Here we report a lead-free double perovskite that exhibits efficient and stable white-light emission via self-trapped excitons that originate from the Jahn–Teller distortion of the AgCl6 octahedron in the excited state. By alloying sodium cations into Cs2AgInCl6, we break the dark transition (the inversion-symmetry-induced parity-forbidden transition) by manipulating the parity of the wavefunction of the self-trapped exciton and reduce the electronic dimensionality of the semiconductor4. This leads to an increase in photoluminescence efficiency by three orders of magnitude compared to pure Cs2AgInCl6. The optimally alloyed Cs2(Ag0.60Na0.40)InCl6 with 0.04 per cent bismuth doping emits warm-white light with 86 ± 5 per cent quantum efficiency and works for over 1,000 hours. We anticipate that these results will stimulate research on single-emitter-based white-light-emitting phosphors and diodes for next-generation lighting and display technologies. After alloying with metal cations, a lead-free halide double perovskite shows stable performance and remarkably efficient white-light emission, with possible applications in lighting and display technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2796310045,"An ensemble of emitters can behave very differently from its individual constituents when they interact coherently via a common light field. After excitation of such an ensemble, collective coupling can give rise to a many-body quantum phenomenon that results in short, intense bursts of light—so-called superfluorescence1. Because this phenomenon requires a fine balance of interactions between the emitters and their decoupling from the environment, together with close identity of the individual emitters, superfluorescence has thus far been observed only in a limited number of systems, such as certain atomic and molecular gases and a few solid-state systems2–7. The generation of superfluorescent light in colloidal nanocrystals (which are bright photonic sources practically suited for optoelectronics8,9) has been precluded by inhomogeneous emission broadening, low oscillator strength, and fast exciton dephasing. Here we show that caesium lead halide (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br) perovskite nanocrystals10–13 that are self-organized into highly ordered three-dimensional superlattices exhibit key signatures of superfluorescence. These are dynamically red-shifted emission with more than 20-fold accelerated radiative decay, extension of the first-order coherence time by more than a factor of four, photon bunching, and delayed emission pulses with Burnham–Chiao ringing behaviour14 at high excitation density. These mesoscopically extended coherent states could be used to boost the performance of opto-electronic devices15 and enable entangled multi-photon quantum light sources16,17. Cooperative quantum effects in superlattices of quantum dots made of caesium lead halide perovskite give rise to superfluorescence, with the individual emitters interacting coherently to give intense bursts of light."
https://openalex.org/W2900431189,"Abiotic hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids are known to be formed on Earth, notably during the hydrothermal alteration of mantle rocks. Although the abiotic formation of amino acids has been predicted both from experimental studies and thermodynamic calculations, its occurrence has not been demonstrated in terrestrial settings. Here, using a multimodal approach that combines high-resolution imaging techniques, we obtain evidence for the occurrence of aromatic amino acids formed abiotically and subsequently preserved at depth beneath the Atlantis Massif (Mid-Atlantic Ridge). These aromatic amino acids may have been formed through Friedel-Crafts reactions catalysed by an iron-rich saponite clay during a late alteration stage of the massif serpentinites. Demonstrating the potential of fluid-rock interactions in the oceanic lithosphere to generate amino acids abiotically gives credence to the hydrothermal theory for the origin of life, and may shed light on ancient metabolisms and the functioning of the present-day deep biosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2805694405,"Understanding the behaviour of isolated quantum systems far from equilibrium and their equilibration is one of the most pressing problems in quantum many-body physics1,2. There is strong theoretical evidence that sufficiently far from equilibrium a wide variety of systems—including the early Universe after inflation3–6, quark–gluon matter generated in heavy-ion collisions7–9, and cold quantum gases4,10–14—exhibit universal scaling in time and space during their evolution, independent of their initial state or microscale properties. However, direct experimental evidence is lacking. Here we demonstrate universal scaling in the time-evolving momentum distribution of an isolated, far-from-equilibrium, one-dimensional Bose gas, which emerges from a three-dimensional ultracold Bose gas by means of a strong cooling quench. Within the scaling regime, the time evolution of the system at low momenta is described by a time-independent, universal function and a single scaling exponent. The non-equilibrium scaling describes the transport of an emergent conserved quantity towards low momenta, which eventually leads to the build-up of a quasi-condensate. Our results establish universal scaling dynamics in an isolated quantum many-body system, which is a crucial step towards characterizing time evolution far from equilibrium in terms of universality classes. Universality would open the possibility of using, for example, cold-atom set-ups at the lowest energies to simulate important aspects of the dynamics of currently inaccessible systems at the highest energies, such as those encountered in the inflationary early Universe. The momentum distribution of atoms in a one-dimensional Bose gas far from equilibrium exhibits universal scaling in space and time, independent of the initial conditions of the system."

https://openalex.org/W2899751551,"Fusarium head blight (FHB or scab) caused by Fusarium spp. is a destructive disease of wheat. Since the most effective sources of FHB resistance are typically associated with unfavorable agronomic traits, breeding commercial cultivars that combine desired agronomic traits and a high level of FHB resistance remains a considerable challenge. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing FHB resistance will help to design more efficient and precise breeding strategies. Here, multiple molecular tools and assays were deployed to compare the resistant variety Sumai3 with three regionally adapted Canadian cultivars. Macroscopic and microscopic disease evaluation established the relative level of Type II FHB resistance of the four varieties and revealed that the F. graminearum infection process displayed substantial temporal differences among organs. The rachis was found to play a critical role in preventing F. graminearum spread within spikes. Large-scale, organ-specific RNA-seq at different times after F. graminearum infection demonstrated that diverse defense mechanisms were expressed faster and more intensely in the spikelet of resistant varieties. The roles of plant hormones during the interaction of wheat with F. graminearum was inferred based on the transcriptomic data obtained and the quantification of the major plant hormones. Salicylic acid and jasmonic acid were found to play predominantly positive roles in FHB resistance, whereas auxin and ABA were associated with susceptibility, and ethylene appeared to play a dual role during the interaction with F graminearum."

https://openalex.org/W2900185100,"Effective public health research and preparedness requires an accurate understanding of which virus species possess or are at risk of developing human transmissibility. Unfortunately, our ability to identify these viruses is limited by gaps in disease surveillance and an incomplete understanding of the process of viral adaptation. By fitting boosted regression trees to data on 224 human viruses and their associated traits, we developed a model that predicts the human transmission ability of zoonotic viruses with over 84% accuracy. This model identifies several viruses that may have an undocumented capacity for transmission between humans. Viral traits that predicted human transmissibility included infection of nonhuman primates, the absence of a lipid envelope, and detection in the human nervous system and respiratory tract. This predictive model can be used to prioritize high-risk viruses for future research and surveillance, and could inform an integrated early warning system for emerging infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2900446172,"The characteristics and conditions of growth and development have made adolescence one of the most vital and influential ages for prevention and health promotion, especially in the area of high-risk behaviors. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine adolescent health information seeking behavior related to high-risk behaviors in a selected educational district in Isfahan (Iran).The present study was of an applied type, which was conducted using the survey research method. The statistical population consisted of adolescent students at public schools in Isfahan (6519 subjects), and the sample size was determined to be 364 based on Cochran's formula. The sampling method was of a cluster sampling type, and the data collection tool was a researcher-made questionnaire. The validity of the questionnaire was approved by medical librarians, and using the Cronbach's alpha method, the reliability was obtained to be 0.85. SPSS 16 software was used for data analysis at two statistical levels: descriptive and inferential (independent t-test, one-sample t-test, chi-square, Pearson correlation coefficient and Mann-Whitney).""Lack of mobility"" was the most important health information need related to adolescent high-risk behaviors. The most important sources to obtain health information related to high-risk behaviors were ""the Internet"" with a mean score of 3.69 and ""virtual social media"" with a mean score of 3.49 out of 5. Adolescents had a positive attitude towards health information. The most important barriers to seeking health information were mentioned as follows: ""difficulty in determining the quality of information found"", ""absence of appropriate information"", and ""concerns about the disclosure of their problems or illness to others"". From the perspective of adolescents, the most important criterion for the evaluation of information quality was ""the trueness and correctness of the information"" and the need for health information related to high-risk behaviors was higher in girls than in boys.Considering adolescents' positive attitude towards use of health information, it is necessary to put valid information at their disposal through different information resources, taking into account their level of information literacy. Accordingly, medical librarians' abilities are suggested to be used for the production, evaluation, and introduction of health-related reading materials in the field of high-risk behaviors in easy language and suitable for adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2899705381,"Viral infections still threaten human health all over the world, and many people die from viral diseases every year. However, there are no effective vaccines or drugs for preventing or managing most viral diseases. Thus, the discovery and development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents remain urgent. Here, we expressed and purified a venom peptide, Ev37, from the scorpion Euscorpiops validus in a prokaryotic system. We found that rEv37 can inhibit dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infections in a dose-dependent manner at noncytotoxic concentrations, but that it has no effect on Sendai virus (SeV) and adenovirus (AdV) infections in vitro. Furthermore, rEv37 alkalized acidic organelles to prevent low pH–dependent fusion of the viral membrane–endosomal membrane, which mainly blocks the release of the viral genome from the endosome to the cytoplasm and then restricts viral late entry. Taken together, our results indicate that the scorpion venom peptide Ev37 is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent with a specific molecular mechanism against viruses undergoing low pH–dependent fusion activation during entry into host cells. We conclude that Ev37 is a potential candidate for development as an antiviral drug.

https://openalex.org/W2899556598,"The amygdala plays an important functional role in fear and anxiety. Abnormalities in the amygdala are believed to be involved in the neurobiological basis of panic disorder (PD). Previous structural neuroimaging studies have found global volumetric and morphological abnormalities in the amygdala in patients with PD. Very few studies, however, have explored for structural abnormalities in various amygdala sub-regions, which consist of various sub-nuclei, each with different functions. This study aimed to evaluate for volumetric abnormalities in the amygdala sub-nuclei, in order to provide a better understanding neurobiological basis of PD. Thirty-eight patients with PD and 38 matched healthy control (HC) participants underwent structural MRI scanning. The volume of the whole amygdala, as well as its consistent sub-nuclei, were calculated using FreeSurfer software. Relative volumes of these amygdala sub-regions were compared between the two groups. Results showed significantly smaller volumes in the right lateral and basal nuclei in the patients with PD compared with the HC. Lateral and basal nuclei are thought to play crucial role for processing sensory information related with anxiety and fear. Our results suggest that these particular amygdala sub-regions play a role in the development of PD symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2900128024,"Lifestyle changes are notoriously difficult. Since women who intend to become pregnant are more susceptible to lifestyle advice, interventions during this time window might be more effective than interventions during any other period in life. We here report the effects of the first large preconception lifestyle intervention RCT on diet and physical activity in obese infertile women.In total, 577 women were randomized between a six-month lifestyle intervention program (intervention group; N = 290) or prompt infertility treatment (control group; N = 287). Self-reported dietary behaviors and physical activity were assessed at baseline, three, six and twelve months after randomization. Mixed models were used to analyze differences between groups.Compared to the control group, the intervention group reduced their intake of sugary drinks at three months (-0.5 glasses/day [95% C.I. = -0.9;-0.2]), of savory snacks at three (-2.4 handful/week [-3.4;-1.4]) and at six months (-1.4 handful/week [-2.6;-0.2]), and of sweet snacks at three (-2.2 portion/week [-3.3;-1.0]) and twelve months after randomization (-1.9 portion/week [-3.5;-0.4]). Also, the intervention group was more moderate to vigorous physically active at three months after randomization compared to the control group (169.0 minutes/week [6.0; 332.1]).Our study showed that obese infertile women who followed a six-month preconception lifestyle intervention program decreased their intake of high caloric snacks and beverages, and increased their physical activity. These changes in lifestyle may not only improve women's health but their offspring's health too."
https://openalex.org/W2900295153,"The size of sexually selected weapons and their performance in battle are both critical to reproductive success, yet these traits are often in opposition. Bigger weapons make better signals. However, due to the mechanical properties of weapons as lever systems, increases in size may inhibit other metrics of performance as different components of the weapon grow out of proportion with one another. Here, using direct force measurements, we investigated the relationship between weapon size and weapon force production in two hindleg weapon systems, frog-legged beetles (Sagra femorata) and leaf-footed cactus bugs (Narnia femorata), to test for performance tradeoffs associated with increased weapon size. In male frog-legged beetles, relative force production decreased as weapon size increased. Yet, absolute force production was maintained across weapon sizes. Surprisingly, mechanical advantage was constant across weapon sizes and large weaponed males had disproportionately large leg muscles. In male leaf-footed cactus bugs, on the other hand, there was no relationship between weapon size and force production, likely reflecting the importance of their hindlegs as signals rather than force-producing structures of male-male competition. Overall, our results suggest that when weapon force production is important for reproductive success, large weaponed animals may overcome mechanical challenges by maintaining proportional lever components and investing in (potentially costly) compensatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2899699453,"Rabies is a fatal encephalitic disease in humans and animals caused by lyssaviruses, most commonly rabies virus (RABV). Human antemortem diagnosis of rabies is a complex process involving multiple sample types and tests for the detection of antibodies, antigen (protein), and nucleic acids (genomic RNA). Serological diagnosis of human rabies includes the detection of either neutralizing or binding antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum samples from unimmunized individuals without prior rabies vaccination or passive immunization with purified immunoglobulins. While neutralizing antibodies are targeted against the surface-expressed glycoprotein (G protein), binding antibodies to viral antigens are predominantly against the nucleoprotein (N protein), although there can be antibodies against all RABV-expressed proteins. To determine N protein-specific antibody responses in the CSF and serum during RABV infection, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with purified recombinant N protein expressed in E. coli. N protein-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) subtypes IgG and IgM were detected in the CSF or serum of previously diagnosed human rabies cases. In addition, anti-N protein seroconversion was demonstrated over the course of illness in individual rabies cases. We compared the N protein ELISA results to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test, the current binding antibody assay used in diagnosis, and show that our ELISA is consistent with the IFA test. Sensitivity and specificity of the N protein ELISA ranged from 78.38-100% and 75.76-96.77% with respect to the IFA results. Our data provide evidence for the use of an N protein ELISA as an additional option for the detection of RABV-specific IgG or IgM antibodies in human CSF or serum specimens."
https://openalex.org/W2899852711,"Quorum sensing (QS) and nucleotide-based second messengers are vital signaling systems that regulate bacterial physiology in response to changing environments. Disrupting bacterial signal transduction is a promising direction to combat infectious diseases, and QS and the second messengers are undoubtedly potential targets. In Vibrio cholerae, both QS and the second messenger 3’, 5’—cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) play a central role in controlling motility, motile-to-sessile life transition, and virulence. In this study, we found that water-soluble extract from the North American cranberry could significantly inhibit V. cholerae biofilm formation during the development/maturation stage by reducing the biofilm matrix production and secretion. The anti-biofilm effect by water-soluble cranberry extract was possibly through modulating the intracellular c-di-GMP level and was independent of QS and the QS master regulator HapR. Our results suggest an opportunity to explore more functional foods to fight stubborn infections through interference with the bacterial signaling systems."
https://openalex.org/W2900194408,"Objective To assess whether antibiotics used for treatment in asymptomatic second-trimester women positive for Mycoplasma or Ureaplasma spp. detected by amniotic-fluid PCR prevents preterm delivery. Design A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting 10 maternal fetal medicine centers in France. Population Women with a singleton pregnancy who underwent amniocentesis between 16 and 20 weeks’ gestation (weeks) for Down syndrome screening. A sample of 238 women with PCR-positive findings per treatment group was needed to show a 50% reduction in the preterm delivery rate. Methods Amniotic fluid was tested. Women with positive findings on real-time PCR of amniotic fluid for Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Ureaplasma parvum were randomized to receive josamycin or placebo. Amniotic fluid was also tested for 16S PCR. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was delivery before 37 weeks. Results In total, 1043 women underwent amniotic-fluid screening with specific PCR detection between July 2008 and July 2011: PCR detection failed in 27 (2.6%), and 20 (1.9%) underwent termination of pregnancy. Among the 1016 women with PCR results, 980 had available data for the primary outcome (delivery before 37 weeks) and 29 (3.0%) were positive for Ureaplasma and/or Mycoplasma spp. Because of the low rate of women with PCR-positive findings, the trial was stopped prematurely. In total, 19 women were randomized to receive placebo (n = 8) or josamycin (n = 11) and their characteristics were comparable, as was the rate of preterm delivery and secondary outcomes. In comparing all PCR-positive and -negative women regardless of treatment, PCR positivity for Ureaplasma and/or Mycoplasma spp. was not associated with any adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcome. Amniotic-fluid screening by 16S PCR showed no other bacterial colonization associated with preterm birth. Conclusions Because of a low amniotic fluid colonization rate, the trial was interrupted. Maternal amniotic-fluid colonization by Mycoplasma and/or Ureaplasma spp. at 16–20 weeks in asymptomatic women is rare and not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

https://openalex.org/W2900292961,"Viruses are important agents of emerging zoonoses and are a substantial public health issue. Among emerging viruses, an important group are arboviruses, which are characterized by being maintained in nature in cycles involving hematophagous arthropod vectors and a wide range of vertebrate hosts. Recently, bats have received increasing attention as an important source for the emergence of zoonoses and as possible viral reservoirs. Among the arboviruses, there are many representatives of the genera Flavivirus and Alphavirus, which are responsible for important epidemics such as Dengue virus, Zika virus and Chikungunya virus. Due to the importance of analyzing potential viral reservoirs for zoonosis control and expanding our knowledge of bat viruses, this study aimed to investigate the presence of viruses of the Alphavirus and Flavivirus genera in bats. We analyzed serum, liver, lungs and intestine from 103 bats sampled in northeast and southern Brazil via Nested-PCR and the hemagglutination inhibition test. All samples tested in this study were negative for arboviruses, suggesting that no active or past infection was present in the captured bats. These data indicate that the bats examined herein probably do not constitute a reservoir for these viruses in the studied areas. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of bats as reservoirs and sources of infection of these viral zoonoses."
https://openalex.org/W2899820804,"Coniothyrium glycines, the causal agent of soybean red leaf blotch, is a USDA APHIS-listed Plant Pathogen Select Agent and potential threat to US agriculture. Sequencing of the C. glycines mt genome revealed a circular 98,533-bp molecule with a mean GC content of 29.01%. It contains twelve of the mitochondrial genes typically involved in oxidative phosphorylation (atp6, cob, cox1-3, nad1-6, and nad4L), one for a ribosomal protein (rps3), four for hypothetical proteins, one for each of the small and large subunit ribosomal RNAs (rns and rnl) and a set of 30 tRNAs. Genes were encoded on both DNA strands with cox1 and cox2 occurring as adjacent genes having no intergenic spacers. Likewise, nad2 and nad3 are adjacent with no intergenic spacers and nad5 is immediately followed by nad4L with an overlap of one base. Thirty-two introns, comprising 54.1% of the total mt genome, were identified within eight protein-coding genes and the rnl. Eighteen of the introns contained putative intronic ORFs with either LAGLIDADG or GIY-YIG homing endonuclease motifs, and an additional eleven introns showed evidence of truncated or degenerate endonuclease motifs. One intron possessed a degenerate N-acetyl-transferase domain. C. glycines shares some conservation of gene order with other members of the Pleosporales, most notably nad6-rnl-atp6 and associated conserved tRNA clusters. Phylogenetic analysis of the twelve shared protein coding genes agrees with commonly accepted fungal taxonomy. C. glycines represents the second largest mt genome from a member of the Pleosporales sequenced to date. This research provides the first genomic information on C. glycines, which may provide targets for rapid diagnostic assays and population studies."
https://openalex.org/W2899564121,"Establishing appropriate heatwave thresholds is important in reducing adverse human health consequences as it enables a more effective heatwave warning system and response plan. This paper defined such thresholds by focusing on the non-linear relationship between heatwave outcomes and meteorological variables as part of an inductive approach. Daily data on emergency department visitors who were diagnosed with heat illnesses and information on 19 meteorological variables were obtained for the years 2011 to 2016 from relevant government agencies. A Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) analysis was performed to explore points (referred to as “knots”) where the behaviour of the variables rapidly changed. For all emergency department visitors, two thresholds (a maximum daily temperature ≥ 32.58°C for 2 consecutive days and a heat index ≥ 79.64) were selected based on the dramatic rise of morbidity at these points. Nonetheless, visitors, who included children and outside workers diagnosed in the early summer season, were reported as being sensitive to heatwaves at lower thresholds. The average daytime temperature (from noon to 6 PM) was determined to represent an alternative threshold for heatwaves. The findings have implications for exploring complex heatwave-morbidity relationships and for developing appropriate intervention strategies to prevent and mitigate the health impact of heatwaves."
https://openalex.org/W2899769704,"The role of non-invasive methods to evaluate fibrosis severity of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) subjects in community needs to be explored. This study investigated FIB-4 and transient elastography (TE) in staging liver fibrosis of CHC subjects in community.A total of 905 subjects who were positive for anti-HCV antibody from five districts of Tainan City of Taiwan were invited to participate in surveillance activities for CHC. FIB-4 and TE were measured for each participant.A total of 502 subjects with detectable HCV RNA and valid TE were enrolled. The distribution of FIB-4 and TE values differed markedly. Both methods exhibited a strongest correlation in subjects with at age 50~60 years (r = 0.655, p <0.001). FIB-4 score increased proportionally with age (p <0.001), but TE did not (p = 0.142). The intraclass correlation efficient of both methods was 0.255 (p <0.001). Subjects with TE defined advanced fibrosis exhibited younger age, higher BMI, higher platelet count, lower FIB-4 score, higher incidence of fatty liver and splenomegaly, and higher controlled attenuation parameter value than those defined by FIB-4. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, higher ALT levels, higher incidence of fatty liver, and presence of splenomegaly were the independent factors associated with advanced fibrosis defined by TE rather than defined by FIB-4.FIB-4 and TE defined different distribution of fibrosis stages in same HCV population. FIB-4 was deeply influenced by age whereas TE was not. TE had the advantages over than FIB-4 in strong association with splenomegaly and in detecting the role of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in advanced fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2899675537,"Swarming is a key part of the natural system of reproduction of anopheline mosquito populations, and a better understanding of swarming and mating systems in a targeted species in its natural habitat would contribute to better design control strategies with a greater chance of success. Our study investigated the monthly occurrence of swarming and the mating frequency (within swarms) of Anopheles arabiensis in Dioulassoba, Burkina Faso and their relationship with local environmental factors. Mosquitoes collected from swarms were described in terms of body size, recent sugar meal intake, and female repletion, insemination, and Plasmodium falciparum infection status. Swarms of An. arabiensis were found in each month of the year. Both start and end times of swarming varied significantly between months, correlating with the time of sunset. Swarming mostly started after or coincided with sunset from late July to early October but occurred before sunset from late October to early July. Swarming duration, the number of mosquitoes and mating pairs per swarm, and time to first mating were significantly different between months in an inverse relationship with the monthly rainfall. The number of mating pairs was strongly and positively correlated with swarm size. Almost all the females caught in copula were inseminated but a very few were blood fed; no P. falciparum infection was observed. Males caught in copula and in solo were similar in body size and in the proportion which had taken a recent sugar meal. Our investigations showed that An. arabiensis reproductive activities are most frequent during the dry season, suggesting either the species’ preference for dry climatic conditions or a lack of available breeding sites during the rainy season due to the seasonal flooding in this area. Targeting interventions to kill mosquitoes in swarms or to achieve an over-flooding ratio of sterile males during the rainy season would increase their efficiency in reducing the population density of this vector."
https://openalex.org/W2899722029,"Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are novel two-dimensional engineered nanomaterials consisting of planar stacks of graphene. Although human exposures are increasing, our knowledge is lacking regarding immune-specific responses to GNPs and mechanisms of interactions. Our current study utilizes a metabolite profiling approach to evaluate macrophage responses to GNPs. Furthermore, we assessed the role of the scavenger receptor CD36 in mediating these GNP-induced responses. GNPs were purchased with dimensions of 2 μm × 2 μm × 12 nm. Macrophages were exposed to GNPs at different concentrations of 0, 25, 50, or 100 μg/ml for 1, 3, or 6 h. Following exposure, no cytotoxicity was observed, while GNPs readily associated with macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner. After the 1h-pretreatment of either a CD36 competitive ligand sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) or a CD36 specific antibody, the cellular association of GNPs by macrophages was significantly reduced. GNP exposure was determined to alter mitochondrial membrane potential while the pretreatment with a CD36 antibody inhibited these changes. In a separate exposure, macrophages were exposed to GNPs at concentrations of 0, 50, or 100 μg/mL for 1 or 3h or 100 μM SSO (a CD36 specific ligand) for 1h and collected for metabolite profiling. Principal component analysis of identified compounds determined differential grouping based on exposure conditions. The number of compounds changed following exposure was determined to be both concentration- and time-dependent. Identified metabolites were determined to relate to several metabolism pathways such as glutathione metabolism, Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, Sphingolipid metabolism, Purine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and others. Lastly, a number of metabolites were found in common between cells exposed to the CD36 receptor ligand, SSO, and GNPs suggesting both CD36-dependent and independent responses to GNP exposure. Together our data demonstrates GNP-macrophage interactions, the role of CD36 in the cellular response, and metabolic pathways disrupted due to exposure."

https://openalex.org/W2899775660,"Cerebellar ataxia is a neurological disorder due to dysfunction of the cerebellum that affects coordination of fine movement, gait, and balance. Although ataxic patients commonly exhibit abnormal eye movement and have difficulties with saccadic reading, quantification of ocular motor abilities during reading in the clinical setting is rarely done. In this study, we assess visual performance with simple reading tests that can be used in the clinical setting and performed video infrared oculography in 11 patients with hereditary or acquired cerebellar ataxia and 11 age-matched controls. We found that compared with controls, ataxic patients read significantly slower on regularly and irregularly spaced 120 single-digit number reading tasks (read aloud) (p = 0.02 for both) but not on a word reading task (read silently), although there was large variability on the word reading task. Among the 3 reading tasks, the regularly spaced number reading task had the greatest difference (44%) between ataxic patients and controls. Analysis of oculography revealed that ataxic patients had slower reading speeds on the regularly spaced number reading task because of significantly higher saccade and fixation counts, impairment of small amplitude progressive saccades as well as large amplitude, line-changing saccades, greater fixation dispersion, and irregularity of scan paths and staircase gaze patterns. Our findings show that infrared oculography remains the gold standard in assessment of ocular motor difficulties during reading in ataxic patients. In the absence of this capability in the clinical setting, a simple 120 regularly spaced single-digit saccadic number reading test, which most patients can perform in less than 2 minutes, can be a possible biomarker for ocular motor abilities necessary for reading."

We hypothesized that adolescents harbor positive opinions of e-cigarette users, and that these opinions will be more positive among adolescents willing to try or who have used e-cigarettes.Participants were 578 U.S. adolescents (ages 14 to 20) recruited from ten California schools. An online survey assessed their attitudes toward and opinions of adolescents who use e-cigarettes in 2015-2016. Analyses examined whether these variables were associated with willingness to try and use (ever vs. never) of e-cigarettes.The majority (61%) of participants had negative overall opinions toward adolescent e-cigarette users. Few participants ascribed positive traits (i.e., sexy, cool, clean, smart, and healthy) to e-cigarette users. Participants who were willing to try or had used e-cigarettes endorsed positive traits more than those unwilling to try and never-users (all p < .01). Participants sometimes endorsed negative traits (i.e., unattractive, trashy, immature, disgusting, and inconsiderate) to describe e-cigarette users. Unwilling and never-users viewed negative traits as more descriptive of e-cigarette users than willing or ever-users (all p < .01).Adolescents generally had somewhat negative opinions of other adolescents who use e-cigarettes. Building on adolescents' negativity toward adolescent e-cigarette users may be a productive direction for prevention efforts, and clinicians can play an important role by keeping apprised of the products their adolescent patients are using and providing information on health effects to support negative opinions or dissuade formation of more positive ones."
https://openalex.org/W2900026702,"The objective of the present study was to analyze individual, contextual and social support factors associated with periodontal condition among 2332 dentate elderly Brazilian participants from the São Paulo State Oral Health Survey 2015 (SBSP-15).This study used the database compiled by the SBSP-15, conducted from January to December in 2015. The associations were made by relative risk (RR), with Multilevel Poisson Regressions, among individual, contextual and social support variables, and had periodontal diseases as outcomes.The mean age of elders was 70.13 years (SD 5.67). The risk factors for all outcomes of periodontal diseases were male gender and self-perceived color of non-white skin. Regarding social support, feeling unhappy was a risk factor for the presence of shallow periodontal pockets (3-5mm) RR 1.43(CI 95% 1.10-1.86). The coverage of the Family Health Strategy (FHS) was a protective factor for gingival bleeding RR = 0.7(CI 95% 0.44-0.99) and calculus RR = 0.75(CI 95% 0.60-0.95), and a risk factor for the number of lost sextants (sextants with only one tooth or without any teeth) RR = 1.12(CI 95% 1.00-1.28). Living in municipalities with more than 90% fluoridation coverage was a protective factor for the number of lost sextants RR = 0.89(CI 95% 0.78-0.99).The study showed evidence that individual (gender and self-perceived skin color), contextual (coverage of the family health strategy and water fluoridation) and social support factors (feeling unhappy) are associated with the clinical outcomes of periodontal diseases in Brazilian elders. This reinforces the need for transdisciplinary actions in the FHS, stimulating work together and intersectoral collaboration between FHS and NASF (Family Health Support Center)."
https://openalex.org/W2899672256,"There is no consensus regarding the relationship between HBV DNA and liver fibrosis, and the relationship between HBV DNA and the degree of liver cirrhosis has not been reported in patients with chronic HBV infection.From January 2011 to December 2016, liver biopsies were performed on 396 patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis. Assessments of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis were based on the Laennec staging system.Serum levels of HBV DNA were correlated with fibrosis and cirrhosis (KW = 73.946, P<0.001). Serum HBV DNA level was correlated with mild fibrosis, moderate to severe fibrosis and cirrhosis (P = 0.009, P<0.001, and P<0.001, respectively). The HBeAg-positive group and HBeAg-negative group showed significant differences in HBV DNA levels, and the rates of mild fibrosis, severe fibrosis and cirrhosis were significantly different between these two groups (F = 17.585, P<0.001 and F = 6.017, P = 0.003, respectively). The replication status of the serum HBV DNA affected fibrosis formation as well as cirrhosis (χ2 = 53.76, P<0.001). In the HBeAg-positive group, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC values of HBV DNA as a predictor for mild fibrosis and cirrhosis were 64.3%, 78.94% and 0.818, respectively, and 81.0%, 69.2%, and 0.871, respectively. In the HBeAg-negative group, the sensitivity, specificity and AUC values of HBV DNA for liver sclerosis prediction were 48%, 76.8% and 0.697, respectively.Different HBV DNA levels had different effects on the formation of fibrosis and sclerosis in liver tissues. HBV DNA levels can predict mild fibrosis and cirrhosis in liver tissue, which is enhanced in HBeAg-positive patients."
https://openalex.org/W2952187573,"Opioids are widely used for treating different types of pains, but overuse and abuse of prescription opioids have led to opioid epidemic in the United States. Besides analgesic effects, chronic use of opioid can also cause tolerance, dependence, and even addiction. Effective treatment of opioid addiction remains a big challenge today. Studies on addictive effects of opioids focus on striatum, a main component in the brain responsible for drug dependence and addiction. Some transcription regulators have been associated with opioid addiction, but relationship between analgesic effects of opioids and dependence behaviors mediated by them at the molecular level has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we developed a new computational strategy that identifies novel targets and potential therapeutic molecular compounds for opioid dependence and addiction. We employed several statistical and machine learning techniques and identified differentially expressed genes over time which were associated with dependence-related behaviors after exposure to either morphine or heroin, as well as potential transcription regulators that regulate these genes, using time course gene expression data from mouse striatum. Moreover, our findings revealed that some of these dependence-associated genes and transcription regulators are known to play key roles in opioid-mediated analgesia and tolerance, suggesting that an intricate relationship between opioid-induce pain-related pathways and dependence may develop at an early stage during opioid exposure. Finally, we determined small compounds that can potentially target the dependence-associated genes and transcription regulators. These compounds may facilitate development of effective therapy for opioid dependence and addiction. We also built a database (http://daportals.org) for all opioid-induced dependence-associated genes and transcription regulators that we discovered, as well as the small compounds that target those genes and transcription regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2899838261,"The goal of this project was to establish the effect of alcohol consumption on the circulating levels of the adipose tissue derived protein C1q TNF Related Protein 3 (CTRP3). Adipose tissue secretes several adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin, which exert a multitude of biological effects important for human health. However, adipose tissue is extremely sensitive to alcohol consumption, leading not only to disrupted fat storage, but also to disruptions in adipokine production. Changes to adipokine secretion could have widespread biological effects and potentially contribute to alcohol-induced ailments, such as alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD). CTRP3 has been previously demonstrated to attenuate fatty liver disease, and suppression of CTRP3 with alcohol consumption could contribute to development of and progression to alcoholic fatty liver disease. To examine the effect of ethanol consumption on circulating adipokine levels, male and female mice were fed an ethanol containing diet (Lieber-DeCarli 5% (v/v) ethanol diet) for 10-days followed by a single gavage of 5 g/kg ethanol (the NIAAA model), or for 6-weeks with no binge added (chronic model). In female mice, adiponectin levels increased ~2-fold in both models of ethanol feeding, but in male mice increased adiponectin levels were only observed after chronic ethanol feeding. On the other hand, in female mice, circulating CTRP3 levels decreased by ~75% and ~50% in the NIAAA and chronic model, respectively, with no changes observed in the male mice in either feeding model. Leptin levels were unchanged with ethanol feeding regardless of model or sex of mice. Lastly, chronic ethanol feeding led to a significant increase in mortality (~50%) in female mice, with no difference in relative ethanol consumption. These findings indicate that ethanol consumption can dysregulate adipokine secretion, but that the effects vary by sex of animal, method of ethanol consumption, and adipokine examined. These findings also indicate that female mice are more sensitive to the chronic effects of ethanol than male mice. Notably, this is the first study to document the effects of ethanol consumption on the circulating levels of CTRP3. Understanding the impact of excessive alcohol consumption on adipokine production and secretion could identify novel mechanisms of alcohol-induced human disease. However, the mechanism responsible for the increased sensitivity remains elusive."
https://openalex.org/W2900015481,"Background Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) is an obligate intracellular bacterium and a human pathogen that causes respiratory infectious diseases. More than 50% of the adult population worldwide was once infected with C. pneumoniae, but investigations into this topic are insufficient in mainland China. Methods Anti-C. pneumoniae IgG and IgM antibodies were detected using micro-immunofluorescence test in serum samples of patients visiting Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 2008 and 2017 for routine medical purposes, and the aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the test results. Results Among 12,050 serum specimens tested for anti-C. pneumoniae IgG and IgM antibodies, the overall prevalence of anti-C. pneumoniae IgG antibodies was 86.6%, 87.2% for men and 86.0% for women. Adult men (>20 years) were found to have a significantly higher prevalence of anti-C. pneumoniae IgG than women (χ2 = 30.32, P = 0.000). 3 to 5 years old patients were observed to have the lowest prevalence of anti-C. pneumoniae IgG, 42.8%, then increased with age, reaching the highest level of 98.6% in patients over 70 years of age. In the 10,434 specimens with C. pneumoniae IgG antibodies, the total geometric mean titer (GMT) for C. pneumoniae IgG was 45.71. Although GMTs were found to be significantly higher among all men than among all women (t = 5.916, P = 0.000), sex difference actually began in patients over 40 years of age and increased in the elderly. In the total 12,050 specimens, 1.2% had anti-C. pneumoniae IgM, 3.3% had anti-C. pneumoniae IgG with titers equal to or greater than 1:512; 0.39% had ≥4-fold increasing titers of antibodies in acute and convalescent phase paired samples, and 4.4% were finally confirmed to have acute antibodies against C. pneumoniae. 6 to 10 years old patients were found to have the highest rate of both IgM antibodies (3.9%) and acute antibodies (6.2%) against C. pneumoniae. Acute antibodies against C. pneumoniae were found to be more frequent in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD, 14.0%, χ2 = 20.43, P = 0.000), patients with pneumonia (7.8%, χ2 = 51.87, P = 0.000) and patients with acute respiratory tract infection (12.3%, χ2 = 60.91, P = 0.000) than among all patients (4.4%). Both anti-C. pneumoniae IgG and IgM antibodies should be tested for acute antibodies against C. pneumoniae as testing for either alone will underestimate by a maximum of two-thirds the incidence of acute antibodies against C. pneumoniae. Conclusions More than 86% of Chinese patients on an average were once infected with C. pneumoniae. Adult men had both a higher prevalence and higher levels of antibodies than women. 6 to10 year old patients were found to have the most frequent acute infection of C. pneumoniae. C. pneumoniae is associated with AECOPD, pneumonia and acute respiratory tract infection. Anti-C. pneumoniae IgG and IgM should be tested simultaneously to avoid underestimation of acute antibodies against C. pneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W2899624189,"The arrestin-related family of proteins (ARTs) are potent regulators of membrane traffic at multiple cellular locations in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several ARTs act at multiple locations, suggesting that ARTs with well-established functions at one location may have additional, as of yet, uncharacterized roles at other locations in the cell. To more fully understand the spectrum of cellular functions regulated by ART proteins, we explored the localization and function of Ldb19/Art1, which has previously been shown to function at the plasma membrane, yet is reported to localize to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). We report that the C-terminal fusion of Ldb19 with GFP is functional and, as previously reported, localizes to the TGN. We further establish that Ldb19 associates with late stages of TGN maturation that are enriched in the clathrin adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1). Additionally, we present genetic interaction assays that suggest Ldb19 acts at the late TGN in a mechanism related to that of AP-1. However, Ldb19 and AP-1 have dissimilar phenotypes in a subset of assays of membrane traffic, suggesting Ldb19 functions at the TGN are distinct from those of AP-1. Together these results indicate Ldb19 functions at the TGN, in addition to its well-established role in endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2950057884,"Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) typically begins with the estimation of single trial activation levels, and several studies have examined how different procedures for estimating single trial activity affect the ultimate classification accuracy of MVPA. Here we show that the currently preferred estimation procedures impart spurious positive correlations between the means of different category activity estimates within the same scanner run. In other words, if the mean of the estimates for one type of trials is high (low) in a given scanner run, then the mean of the other type of trials is also high (low) for that same scanner run, and the run-level mean across all trials therefore shifts from run to run. Simulations show that these correlations occur whenever there is a need to deconvolve overlapping trial activities in the presence of noise. We show that subtracting each voxel’s run-level mean across all trials from all the estimates within that run (i.e., run-level mean centering of estimates), by cancelling out these mean shifts, leads to robust and significant improvements in MVPA classification accuracy. These improvements are seen in both simulated and real data across a wide variety of situations. However, we also point out that there could be cases when mean activations are expected to shift across runs and that run-level mean centering could be detrimental in some of these cases (e.g., different proportion of trial types between different runs)."
https://openalex.org/W2899878884,"Chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, cause severe immunosuppression and patients become susceptible to infections. Based on this, the immunomodulatory potential of tarin, a lectin from Colocasia esculenta, was evaluated in bone marrow cell cultures and in cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed mice. Tarin promoted maintenance of hematopoietic progenitors and repopulation of Gr1 cells in vitro which was supported by in vivo results. In immunosuppressed mice, tarin increased bone marrow cell numbers and altered cell profile distribution by enhancing the frequency of Gr1+ progenitors, including Ly6-CintLy6-Glo, and anticipating their proliferation/differentiation in mature cells, especially Ly6-CloLy6-Ghi. Bone marrow cells harvested from tarin-treated immunosuppressed mice proliferated in response to GM-CSF or G-CSF in vitro and, the low numbers of bone marrow cells in the G0 phase, combined with a high number cells undergoing apoptosis confirmed that tarin promoted a faster and intense proliferation/differentiation, even in the presence of CY-induced toxicity. As a result, tarin minimized leukopenia in immunosuppressed mice promoting a faster recovery of peripheral leucocytes and protected erythroid bone marrow cells from CY-cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Data suggest that tarin could be considered a potential adjuvant to decrease leukopenia and possibly ameliorate anemia, if carefully evaluated in human cancer cell lineages and in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2899945943,"The lack of direct neurophysiological recordings from the thalamus and the cortex hampers our understanding of vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and minimally conscious state in humans. We obtained microelectrode recordings from the thalami and the homolateral parietal cortex of two vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and one minimally conscious state patients during surgery for implantation of electrodes in both thalami for chronic deep brain stimulation. We found that activity of the thalamo-cortical networks differed among the two conditions. There were half the number of active neurons in the thalami of patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome than in minimally conscious state. Coupling of thalamic neuron discharge with EEG phases also differed in the two conditions and thalamo-cortical cross-frequency coupling was limited to the minimally conscious state patient. When consciousness is physiologically or pharmacologically reversibly suspended there is a significant increase in bursting activity of the thalamic neurons. By contrast, in the thalami of our patients in both conditions fewer than 17% of the recorded neurons showed bursting activity. This indicates that these conditions differ from physiological suspension of consciousness and that increased thalamic inhibition is not prominent. Our findings, albeit obtained in a limited number of patients, unveil the neurophysiology of these conditions at single unit resolution and might be relevant for inspiring novel therapeutic options."

https://openalex.org/W2898387936,"Understanding information processing in the brain requires the ability to determine the functional connectivity between the different regions of the brain. We present a method using transfer entropy to extract this flow of information between brain regions from spike-train data commonly obtained in neurological experiments. Transfer entropy is a statistical measure based in information theory that attempts to quantify the information flow from one process to another, and has been applied to find connectivity in simulated spike-train data. Due to statistical error in the estimator, inferring functional connectivity requires a method for determining significance in the transfer entropy values. We discuss the issues with numerical estimation of transfer entropy and resulting challenges in determining significance before presenting the trial-shuffle method as a viable option. The trial-shuffle method, for spike-train data that is split into multiple trials, determines significant transfer entropy values independently for each individual pair of neurons by comparing to a created baseline distribution using a rigorous statistical test. This is in contrast to either globally comparing all neuron transfer entropy values or comparing pairwise values to a single baseline value. In establishing the viability of this method by comparison to several alternative approaches in the literature, we find evidence that preserving the inter-spike-interval timing is important. We then use the trial-shuffle method to investigate information flow within a model network as we vary model parameters. This includes investigating the global flow of information within a connectivity network divided into two well-connected subnetworks, going beyond local transfer of information between pairs of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2899553148,"An ongoing challenge of estimating the burden of infectious diseases known to disproportionately affect migrants (e.g. malaria, enteric fever) is that many health information systems, including reportable disease surveillance systems, do not systematically collect data on migrant status and related factors. We explored whether health administrative data linked to immigration records offered a viable alternative for accurately identifying cases of hepatitis A, malaria and enteric fever in Ontario, Canada. Using linked health care databases generated by Ontario’s universal health care program, we constructed a cohort of medically-attended individuals with presumed hepatitis A, malaria or enteric fever in Peel region using diagnostic codes. Immigrant status was ascertained using linked immigration data. The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of diagnostic codes was evaluated through probabilistic linkage of the cohort to Ontario’s reportable disease surveillance system (iPHIS) as the reference standard. Linkage was successful in 90.0% (289/321) of iPHIS cases. While sensitivity was high for hepatitis A and enteric fever (85.8% and 83.7%) and moderate for malaria (69.0%), PPV was poor for all diseases (0.3–41.3%). The accuracy of diagnostic codes did not vary by immigrant status. A dated coding system for outpatient physician claims and exclusion of new immigrants not yet eligible for health care were key challenges to using health administrative data to identify cases. Despite this, we show that linkages of health administrative and immigration records with reportable disease surveillance data are feasible and have the potential to bridge important gaps in estimating burden using either data source independently."
https://openalex.org/W2900082514,"Insect-resistance of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton varies among plants organs and with different environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of soil salinity on Bt protein concentration in cotton squares and to elucidate the potential mechanism of Bt efficacy reduction. Two cotton cultivars (NuCOTN 33B and CCRI 07, salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant) were subjected to salinity stress under four natural saline levels in field conditions in 2015 and 2016 and seven regimes of soil salinity ranged from 0.5 to 18.8 dS m-1 in greenhouse conditions in 2017. Results of field studies revealed that Bt protein content was not significantly changed at 7.13 dS m-1 salinity, but exhibited a significant drop at the 10.41 and 14.16 dS m-1 salinity. The greenhouse experiments further showed similar trends that significant declines of the insecticidal protein contents in squares were detected when soil salinity exceeded 9.1 dS m-1. Meanwhile, high salinity resulted in significant reduction in contents of soluble protein and total nitrogen, activities of nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT), but increased amino acid content, activities of protease and peptidase in cotton squares. High salinity also decreased root vigor (RV), root total absorption area (RTA) and root active absorption area (RAA). The extent of decrease of Bt protein content was more pronounced in NuCOTN 33B than CCRI 07, and CCRI07 exhibited stronger enzymes activities involved in square protein synthesis and higher levels of RV, RTA and RAA. Therefore, the results of our present study indicated that insecticidal protein expression in cotton squares were significantly affected by higher salinity (equal to or higher than 9.1 dS m-1), reduced protein synthesis and increased protein degradation in squares and reduced metabolic activities in roots might lead to the decrease of Bt protein content in squares."
https://openalex.org/W2900189529,"High-throughput sequencing has revealed a tremendous complexity of cellular transcriptomes, which is partly due to the generation of multiple alternative transcripts from a single gene locus. Because alternative transcripts often have low abundance in bulk cells, the functions of most of these transcripts and their relationship with their canonical counterparts remain unclear. Here we applied single-cell RNA-Seq to analyze the transcriptome complexity of in vitro–differentiated, murine type 2 T helper (Th2) cells. We found that cytokine gene transcripts contribute most of the intercellular heterogeneity, with a group of universal cytokines, including interleukins 1a, 2, 3, and 16, being bimodally expressed. At the single-cell level, use of alternative promoters prevalently generated alternative transcripts. For instance, although undetectable in bulk cells, a noncoding RNA isoform of IL-4 (IL4nc), which was driven by an intronic promoter in the IL-4 locus, was predominantly expressed in a subset of Th2 cells. IL4nc displayed distinct temporal expression patterns compared with the canonical IL-4 mRNA and post-transcriptionally promoted the production of IL-4 protein in Th2 cells. In conclusion, our findings reveal a mechanism whereby minor noncanonical transcripts post-transcriptionally regulate expression of their cognate canonical genes."

To validate the results using RAPID-SI and to demonstrate its usefulness in terms of acquisition time and data quantification; simulations, phantom and in vivo studies were conducted, and the results were compared to standard CSI. The method was based upon the partition of a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) signal into sequential sub-signals encoded using blipped phase encoding gradients inserted during signal acquisition at a constant time interval. The RAPID-SI technique was implemented on a clinical 3 T Siemens scanner to demonstrate its clinical utility. Acceleration of data collection was performed by inserting R (R = acceleration factor) blipped gradients along a given spatial direction during data acquisition. Compared to CSI, RAPID-SI reduced acquisition time by the acceleration factor R. For example, a 2D 16x16 data set acquired in about 17 min with CSI, was reduced to approximately 2 min with the RAPID-SI (R = 8). While the SNR of the acquired RAPID-SI signal was lower compared to CSI by approximately the factor √R, it can be improved after data pre-processing and reconstruction. Compared to CSI, RAPID-SI reduces acquisition time, while preserving metabolites information. Furthermore, the method is flexible and could be combined with other acceleration methods such as Parallel Imaging."

Aim Investigate the feasibility of automating the current, manual, HCAI reporting using linked electronic health records (linked-EHR), and assess its level of accuracy. Methods All data previously submitted through the HCAI-DCS by the Oxford University Hospitals infection control (IC) team for methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, MSSA), Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia coli, through March 2017 were downloaded and compared to outputs created from linked-EHR, with detailed comparisons between 2013–2017. Findings Total MRSA, MSSA, E. coli and C. difficile cases entered by the IC team vs linked-EHR were 428 vs 432, 795 vs 816, 2454 vs 2450 and 3365 vs 3393 respectively. From 2013–2017, most discrepancies (32/37 (86%)) were likely due to IC recording errors. Patient and specimen identifiers were completed for >98% of cases by both methods, with very high agreement (>97%). Fields relating to the patient at the time the specimen was taken were complete to a similarly high level (>99% IC, >97% linked-EHR), and agreement was fairly good (>80%) except for the main and treatment specialties (57% and 54% respectively) and the patient category (55%). Optional, organism-specific data-fields were less complete, by both methods. Where comparisons were possible, agreement was reasonably high (mostly 70–90%). Conclusion Basic factual information, such as demographic data, is almost-certainly better automated, and many other data fields can potentially be populated successfully from linked-EHR. Manual data collection is time-consuming and inefficient; automated electronic data collection would leave healthcare professionals free to focus on clinical rather than administrative work."
https://openalex.org/W2899601851,Pure torsional shear tests of joints glued with two different aerospace grade adhesives were performed using a specifically designed and constructed torsional shear test equipment. The developed test equipment allows for measuring of pure torsional shear strength under cryogenic and at elevated temperature conditions. The adhesives Hysol EA 9321 and 3M Scotch-Weld EC-9323-2 B/A were used to join steel torsional shear test specimens. Torsional shear tests were performed from -180°C to 150°C. In addition torsional shear fatigue tests were also performed at various loads and the effect of cryogenic aging (cyclic cooling and warming) on the torsional strength of the joints was investigated. The results showed that both sets of adhesive joints achieved three times higher torsional shear strength at -180°C compared to room temperature.
https://openalex.org/W2899740737,"We describe a method for analyzing the within-household network dynamics of a disease transmission. We apply it to analyze the occurrences of endemic diarrheal disease in Cameroon, Central Africa based on observational, cross-sectional data available from household health surveys.To analyze the data, we apply formalism of the dynamic SID (susceptible-infected-diseased) process that describes the disease steady-state while adjusting for the household age-structure and environment contamination, such as water contamination. The SID transmission rates are estimated via MCMC method with the help of the so-called synthetic likelihood approach.The SID model is fitted to a dataset on diarrhea occurrence from 63 households in Cameroon. We show that the model allows for quantification of the effects of drinking water contamination on both transmission and recovery rates for household diarrheal disease occurrence as well as for estimation of the rate of silent (unobserved) infections.The new estimation method appears capable of genuinely capturing the complex dynamics of disease transmission across various human, animal and environmental compartments at the household level. Our approach is quite general and can be used in other epidemiological settings where it is desirable to fit transmission rates using cross-sectional data.The R-scripts for carrying out the computational analysis described in the paper are available at https://github.com/cbskust/SID."

A recent linguistic theory suggests that C/Ms carry quantity information, where C and M converge as the multiplicand, with numeral as the multiplier, but C and M diverge in the mathematical values they denote. However, previous empirical studies were sparse and presented inconsistent results. This study aimed to investigate the mathematical function of C/Ms using the number-size task in which participants had to choose from two C/M phrases the one that represents a larger quantity or in a larger font size. If C/M phrases engage quantity processing like numbers, distance and congruity effects should emerge. As expected, participants performed more accurately and faster at comparing two distant stimuli than two proximate ones, indicating that the mathematical values of C/M were represented like a mental number line. Moreover, participants' performance was partially influenced by the irrelevant information from the other dimension, suggesting that the mathematical values of C/Ms and the physical font size interfere with each other. These results corroborated that C/Ms play a role in magnitude cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2900045101,"In distributed speech recognition applications, the front-end device that stands for any handheld electronic device like smartphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) captures the speech signal, extracts the speech features, and then sends the speech-feature vector sequence to the back-end server for decoding. Since the front-end mobile device has limited computation capacity, battery power and bandwidth, there exists a feasible strategy of reducing the frame rate of the speech-feature vector sequence to alleviate the drawback. Previously, we proposed a method for adjusting the transition probabilities of the hidden Markov model to enable it to address the degradation of recognition accuracy caused by the frame-rate mismatch between the input and the original model. The previous model adaptation method is referred to as the adapting-then-connecting approach that adapts each model individually and then connects the adapted models to form a word network for speech recognition. We have found that this model adaption approach introduces transitions that skip too many states and increase the number of insertion errors. In this study, we propose an improved model adaptation approach denoted as the connecting-then-adapting approach that first connects the individual models to form a word network and then adapts the connected network for speech recognition. This new approach calculates the transition matrix of a connected model, adapts the transition matrix of the connected model according to the frame rate, and then creates a transition arc for each transition probability. The new approach can better align the speech feature sequence with the states in the word network and therefore reduce the number of insertion errors. We conducted experiments to investigate the effectiveness of our new approach and analyzed the results with respect to insertion, deletion, and substitution errors. The experimental results indicate that the proposed new method obtains a better recognition rate than the old method."
