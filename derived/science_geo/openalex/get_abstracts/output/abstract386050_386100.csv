https://openalex.org/W2172240107,"Silicon transistors in microelectronics are shrinking to close to the size at which quantum effects begin to have an impact on device performance. As silicon looks certain to remain the semiconductor material of choice for a while yet, such effects may be turned into an advantage by designing silicon devices that can process quantum information. One approach is to make use of electron spins generated by phosphorus dopant atoms buried in silicon, as they are known to represent well-isolated quantum bits (qubits) with long coherence times. It has not been possible to control single electrons in silicon with the precision for qubits, but now Andrea Morello and colleagues report single-shot, time-resolved readout of electron spins in silicon. This is achieved by placing the phosphorus donor atoms near a charge-sensing device called a single-electron transistor, which is fully compatible with current microelectronic technology. The demonstrated high-fidelity single-shot spin readout opens a path to the development of a new generation of quantum computing and spintronic devices in silicon. Electron spins generated by phosphorus dopant atoms buried in silicon represent well-isolated quantum bits with long coherence times, but so far the control of such single electrons has been insufficient to use them in this way. These authors report single-shot, time-resolved readout of electron spins in silicon, achieved by coupling the donor atoms to a charge-sensing device called a single-electron transistor. This opens a path to the development of a new generation of quantum computing and spintronic devices in silicon. The size of silicon transistors used in microelectronic devices is shrinking to the level at which quantum effects become important1. Although this presents a significant challenge for the further scaling of microprocessors, it provides the potential for radical innovations in the form of spin-based quantum computers2,3,4 and spintronic devices5. An electron spin in silicon can represent a well-isolated quantum bit with long coherence times6 because of the weak spin–orbit coupling7 and the possibility of eliminating nuclear spins from the bulk crystal8. However, the control of single electrons in silicon has proved challenging, and so far the observation and manipulation of a single spin has been impossible. Here we report the demonstration of single-shot, time-resolved readout of an electron spin in silicon. This has been performed in a device consisting of implanted phosphorus donors9 coupled to a metal-oxide-semiconductor single-electron transistor10,11—compatible with current microelectronic technology. We observed a spin lifetime of ∼6 seconds at a magnetic field of 1.5 tesla, and achieved a spin readout fidelity better than 90 per cent. High-fidelity single-shot spin readout in silicon opens the way to the development of a new generation of quantum computing and spintronic devices, built using the most important material in the semiconductor industry."

https://openalex.org/W1997524825,"The paradoxical appearance of aggregated α-synuclein (αsyn) in naive transplanted embryonic stem cells in Parkinson's disease (PD) brains has recently been reported, highlighting the possibility of neuron to neuron transmission of αsyn in PD. Here, we demonstrate in a cellular model the presence of αsyn oligomers in the extracellular space, their uptake by neurons, retrograde axonal transport to cell soma, and detrimental effects on neighboring cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that Hsp70 chaperones αsyn in the extracellular space and reduces extracellular αsyn oligomer formation and related toxicity. These novel findings provide evidence that extracellular αsyn oligomers may represent a crucial player in the propagation of pathology in PD, with their modulation by Hsp70 representing a potential new target for therapeutic interventions."

https://openalex.org/W1983101401,"Cell-cell signalling of semaphorin ligands through interaction with plexin receptors is important for the homeostasis and morphogenesis of many tissues and is widely studied for its role in neural connectivity, cancer, cell migration and immune responses. SEMA4D and Sema6A exemplify two diverse vertebrate, membrane-spanning semaphorin classes (4 and 6) that are capable of direct signalling through members of the two largest plexin classes, B and A, respectively. In the absence of any structural information on the plexin ectodomain or its interaction with semaphorins the extracellular specificity and mechanism controlling plexin signalling has remained unresolved. Here we present crystal structures of cognate complexes of the semaphorin-binding regions of plexins B1 and A2 with semaphorin ectodomains (human PLXNB1(1-2)-SEMA4D(ecto) and murine PlxnA2(1-4)-Sema6A(ecto)), plus unliganded structures of PlxnA2(1-4) and Sema6A(ecto). These structures, together with biophysical and cellular assays of wild-type and mutant proteins, reveal that semaphorin dimers independently bind two plexin molecules and that signalling is critically dependent on the avidity of the resulting bivalent 2:2 complex (monomeric semaphorin binds plexin but fails to trigger signalling). In combination, our data favour a cell-cell signalling mechanism involving semaphorin-stabilized plexin dimerization, possibly followed by clustering, which is consistent with previous functional data. Furthermore, the shared generic architecture of the complexes, formed through conserved contacts of the amino-terminal seven-bladed β-propeller (sema) domains of both semaphorin and plexin, suggests that a common mode of interaction triggers all semaphorin-plexin based signalling, while distinct insertions within or between blades of the sema domains determine binding specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2110181951,"A drawback of electrical stimulation for muscle control is that large, fatigable motor units are preferentially recruited before smaller motor units by the lowest-intensity electrical cuff stimulation. This phenomenon limits therapeutic applications because it is precisely the opposite of the normal physiological (orderly) recruitment pattern; therefore, a mechanism to achieve orderly recruitment has been a long-sought goal in physiology, medicine and engineering. Here we demonstrate a technology for reliable orderly recruitment in vivo. We find that under optical control with microbial opsins, recruitment of motor units proceeds in the physiological recruitment sequence, as indicated by multiple independent measures of motor unit recruitment including conduction latency, contraction and relaxation times, stimulation threshold and fatigue. As a result, we observed enhanced performance and reduced fatigue in vivo. These findings point to an unanticipated new modality of neural control with broad implications for nervous system and neuromuscular physiology, disease research and therapeutic innovation."
https://openalex.org/W2048526645,"Epidemiological studies indicate that intake of statins decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer disease. Cellular and in vivo studies suggested that statins might decrease the generation of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) from the β-amyloid precursor protein. Here, we show that statins potently stimulate the degradation of extracellular Aβ by microglia. The statin-dependent clearance of extracellular Aβ is mainly exerted by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) that is secreted in a nonconventional pathway in association with exosomes. Stimulated IDE secretion and Aβ degradation were also observed in blood of mice upon peripheral treatment with lovastatin. Importantly, increased IDE secretion upon lovastatin treatment was dependent on protein isoprenylation and up-regulation of exosome secretion by fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate a novel pathway for the nonconventional secretion of IDE via exosomes. The modulation of this pathway could provide a new strategy to enhance the extracellular clearance of Aβ."
https://openalex.org/W2027103072,"Background During much of the Late Cretaceous, a shallow, epeiric sea divided North America into eastern and western landmasses. The western landmass, known as Laramidia, although diminutive in size, witnessed a major evolutionary radiation of dinosaurs. Other than hadrosaurs (duck-billed dinosaurs), the most common dinosaurs were ceratopsids (large-bodied horned dinosaurs), currently known only from Laramidia and Asia. Remarkably, previous studies have postulated the occurrence of latitudinally arrayed dinosaur “provinces,” or “biomes,” on Laramidia. Yet this hypothesis has been challenged on multiple fronts and has remained poorly tested. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe two new, co-occurring ceratopsids from the Upper Cretaceous Kaiparowits Formation of Utah that provide the strongest support to date for the dinosaur provincialism hypothesis. Both pertain to the clade of ceratopsids known as Chasmosaurinae, dramatically increasing representation of this group from the southern portion of the Western Interior Basin of North America. Utahceratops gettyi gen. et sp. nov.—characterized by short, rounded, laterally projecting supraorbital horncores and an elongate frill with a deep median embayment—is recovered as the sister taxon to Pentaceratops sternbergii from the late Campanian of New Mexico. Kosmoceratops richardsoni gen. et sp. nov.—characterized by elongate, laterally projecting supraorbital horncores and a short, broad frill adorned with ten well developed hooks—has the most ornate skull of any known dinosaur and is closely allied to Chasmosaurus irvinensis from the late Campanian of Alberta. Conclusions/Significance Considered in unison, the phylogenetic, stratigraphic, and biogeographic evidence documents distinct, co-occurring chasmosaurine taxa north and south on the diminutive landmass of Laramidia. The famous Triceratops and all other, more nested chasmosaurines are postulated as descendants of forms previously restricted to the southern portion of Laramidia. Results further suggest the presence of latitudinally arrayed evolutionary centers of endemism within chasmosaurine ceratopsids during the late Campanian, the first documented occurrence of intracontinental endemism within dinosaurs."
https://openalex.org/W2027926561,"Acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyzes the synthesis of triacylglycerols. Two DGAT enzymes have been identified (DGAT1 and DGAT2) with unique roles in lipid metabolism. DGAT1 is a multifunctional acyltransferase capable of synthesizing diacylglycerol, retinyl, and wax esters in addition to triacylglycerol. Here, we report the membrane topology for murine DGAT1 using protease protections assays and indirect immunofluorescence in conjunction with selective permeabilization of cellular membranes. Topology models based on prediction algorithms suggested that DGAT1 had eight transmembrane domains. In contrast, our data indicate that DGAT1 has three transmembrane domains with the N terminus oriented toward the cytosol. The C-terminal region of DGAT1, which accounts for ∼50% of the protein, is present in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and contains a highly conserved histidine residue (His-426) that may be part of the active site. Mutagenesis of His-426 to alanine impaired the ability of DGAT1 to synthesize triacylglycerols as well as retinyl and wax esters in an in vitro acyltransferase assay. Finally, we show that the N-terminal domain of DGAT1 is not required for the catalytic activity of DGAT1 but, instead, may be involved in regulating enzyme activity and dimer/tetramer formation.

DGAT catalyzes the formation of an ester bond between a long chain fatty acid (fatty acyl coenzyme A (CoA)) and the free hydroxyl group of diacylglycerol (DG), generating TG. Two DGAT genes have now been identified, Dgat1 and Dgat2, which share no sequence homology. DGAT1 belongs to a large family of membrane-bound O-acyltransferases (MBOAT) that includes acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 and -2 (ACAT-1 and -2), which catalyze cholesterol ester biosynthesis (6Cases S.

Biochemical analyses have indicated that DGAT1 and DGAT2 have distinct roles in TG metabolism. When overexpressed in cells, DGAT2 yielded a much larger increase in intracellular triacylglycerol than DGAT1 (17Stone S.J. Myers H.M. Watkins S.M. Brown B.E. Feingold K.R. Elias P.M.

In in vitro assays, DGAT1, but not DGAT2, was capable of using a broad array of acyl acceptors to synthesize diacylglycerol, retinyl, and wax esters in addition to triacylglycerol (18Yen C.L.

In vivo experiments in mice have also provided strong evidence that DGAT1 and DGAT2 do not serve redundant roles in lipid metabolism. Dgat1-deficient (Dgat1−/−) mice were viable with modest reductions in TG content, were resistant to diet-induced obesity, and had improved glucose metabolism (19Wang S.J. Cornick C. O'Dowd J.

More recently, overexpression of DGAT1 in mouse macrophages had a protective effect against the activation of inflammatory pathways induced by diet-induced obesity (23Koliwad S.K. Streeper R.S. Monetti M. Cornelissen I. Chan L. Terayama K. Naylor S. Rao M. Hubbard B. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 756-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast, DGAT2 appears to be much more involved in promoting bulk TG synthesis. Dgat2-deficient (Dgat2−/−) mice had a ∼90% reduction in carcass TG content and died within a few hours after birth due to skin abnormalities (17Stone S.J. Myers H.M. Watkins S.M. Brown B.E.

DGAT1 and DGAT2 are integral membrane proteins that reside at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (24Stone S.J. Levin M.C. Zhou P. Han J. Walther T.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5352-5361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 25Kuerschner L. Moessinger C. Thiele C. Traffic. 2008; 9: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DGAT2 also interacts with lipid droplets and mitochondria, whereas DGAT1 does not. Topological studies of DGAT2 demonstrated that this enzyme has two transmembrane domains, and the N and C termini are exposed to the cytosol (26Stone S.J. Levin M.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 40273-40282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A highly conserved four-amino acid sequence (HPHG) present in all DGAT2 family members was required for the full catalytic activity of DGAT2 and is thought to be part of the active site. The HPHG sequence of DGAT2 faces the cytosol, which may be important for directing newly synthesized TG for their storage in lipid droplets. The topology of DGAT1 has not been mapped experimentally, although it has been predicted to have 6–12 possible transmembrane domains (6Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The membrane topologies of human ACAT1 and ACAT2, which share 15–25% identity with DGAT1, have been determined. ACAT1 appears to have 5–9 transmembrane domains with the N terminus facing the cytosol and the C terminus in the ER lumen (27Guo Z.Y. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10063-10071Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Joyce C.W. Shelness G.S. Davis M.A. Lee R.G. Skinner K. Anderson R.A. Rudel L.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3675-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Two different models have been proposed for human ACAT2. One model proposes that ACAT2 has two transmembrane domains, and both the N and C termini face the cytosol (29Lin S. Lu X. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2447-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The second model suggests that ACAT2 has five transmembrane domains, and the termini are on opposite sides of the ER membrane (28Joyce C.W. Shelness G.S. Davis M.A. Lee R.G. Skinner K. Anderson R.A. Rudel L.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3675-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). ACAT1 and ACAT2 are capable of forming homodimers and homotetramers (30Cho K.H. An S. Lee W.S. Paik Y.K. Kim Y.K. Jeong T.S. BBRC. 2003; 309: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Yu C. Chen J. Lin S. Liu J. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

For ACAT1, homotetramer formation is important for the in vitro catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (32Yu C. Zhang Y. Lu X. Chen J. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3762-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Deletion of part of the N terminus changes ACAT1 from a tetramer to dimer and increases the enzymatic activity of ACAT1. Like the ACAT enzymes, DGAT1 also can form dimers and tetramers (33Cheng D. Meegalla R.L. He B. Cromley D.A. Billheimer J.T. Young P.R. Biochem.

The functional significance of this higher order structure for DGAT1 function has not been examined. It does appear that the ability to form a tetramer resides in the N-terminal domain and that the individual DGAT1 subunits of the tetramer catalyze TG synthesis independently of each other (33Cheng D. Meegalla R.L. He B. Cromley D.A. Billheimer J.T. Young P.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this report we determined the membrane topology of murine DGAT1 using protease protection assays and immunofluorescence microscopy. We also identified a histidine residue that may be part of the active site of DGAT1. Lastly, we provide evidence that the N terminus of DGAT1 may be involved in regulating DGAT activity through tetramer formation. HEK-293T and COS-7 cells (American Type Tissue Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. For transfections, 20 µg of plasmid DNA was incubated with 430 µl of 0.15 m NaCl and 120 µl of 0.1% polyethyleneimine (pH 7.0) for 10 min at room temperature. The transfection mixture was then added dropwise to a 100-mm culture dish containing 10 ml of DMEM with10% fetal bovine serum and cells at ∼50% confluence. After 4 h, the medium was removed, and cells were washed and re-fed with media. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and used for experiments. N-terminal FLAG-tagged murine DGAT1 (FL-DGAT1) in the eukaryotic expression vector, pCDNA3.1, was used as a template for all mutagenesis reactions. The various mutations and insertion of Myc (EQKLISEEDL) and HA (YPYDVPDYA) epitope tags were generated using the primer pairs listed in supplemental Table 1 with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations (the cDNA for murine DGAT1 was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Farese, Jr.). HEK-293T cells expressing the various DGAT1 mutants were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested by scraping, and collected by centrifugation (1000 × g). Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and disrupted by 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Cell debris and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min. To isolate total cellular membranes, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in PBS. A typical 50-µl reaction contained 50 µg of total membrane protein and 20 µg/ml trypsin (Sigma) with or without 1% Triton X-100, which was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.4 µg/µl final concentration) (Sigma). An equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer (Bio-Rad) was added to the samples, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 20–30 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Total cellular membranes (1 µg/µl protein) were incubated with the cross-linker, disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (Pierce) at a final concentration of 1 mm in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA buffer for 50 min at room temperature. DSS was dissolved in DMSO (2.5% (final)). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 110 volume of 1 m Tris-Cl (pH 8.0). Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Transfected HEK-293T cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested by scraping, and collected by centrifugation (1000 × g). The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 250 mm sucrose and passed through a 27-gauge needle 10 times. Cell debris and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min. Total cellular membranes (50 µg of protein) were used for in vitro DGAT activity assays (17Stone S.J. Myers H.M.

For some assays, the 1,2-diacylglycerol was replaced with either 0.2 mm all trans-retinol or 0.2 mm 1-hexadecanol to measure acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) and wax synthase activities, respectively (35Yen C.L.

Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed by incubating PVDF membranes with antibodies at the following dilutions: mouse anti-FLAG-M2 (Sigma), 1:4000; rabbit anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (Stressgen), 1:1000; mouse anti-Myc (9E10 hybridoma supernatant), 1:10; mouse anti-HA (Sigma), 1:4000; anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Amersham Biosciences), 1:4000; anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Bio-Rad), 1:4000. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized using the Supersignal West Pico kit (Pierce). Membranes were exposed to Hyblot Cl (Denville Scientific) film. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with FL-DGAT1-Myc. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were re-plated into 6-well dishes containing glass coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. After washing three times with PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Plasma membranes were selectively permeabilized with 10 µg/ml digitonin in 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 25 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6) for 10 min on ice. Alternatively, after fixation, total cellular membranes were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min at room temperature. After permeabilization, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 5 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with either mouse anti-FLAG-M2 (1:500 dilution) and rabbit anti-PDI (1:200 dilution) or rabbit anti-FLAG (1:200 dilution) and mouse anti-Myc (clone (9E10) (1:10 dilution) and then with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) (1:200 dilution) and donkey anti-mouse 594 (Molecular Probes) (1:200 dilution) secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted on glass slides with a drop of Immuno-Fluore mounting medium (ICN). Images were acquired using the appropriate filter sets with an Olympus Fluoview FV300 confocal microscope. Images were captured using the same wavelength, light intensity, and acquisition settings. Images shown are representative of results for the majority of transfected cells in each experiment. A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot (36Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) indicated that murine DGAT1 had several hydrophobic regions that could be potential transmembrane domains (Fig. 1A). Using several different algorithms that predict hydrophobic regions of a protein (Table 1), a consensus model of the membrane topology of murine DGAT1 was constructed (Fig. 1B). This model indicated that DGAT1 had eight potential transmembrane domains. No clear consensus was obtained using these algorithms to determine the orientation of the N and C termini. Some of the prediction algorithms suggested that the termini of DGAT1 were on the same side of the ER membrane, whereas others indicated that they were on opposite sides.TABLE 1Predicted transmembrane domains for murine DGAT1Analysis softwareNo. of TMDsTMHMM9SOSUI6Phobius9TMAP8TMpred8TopPred9HMMTOP9 Open table in a new tab To determine the orientation of the N and C termini of DGAT1, constructs were generated that contained a FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus and either an HA (FL-DGAT1-HA) or Myc (FL-DGAT1-Myc) epitope tag at the C terminus of murine DGAT1 (Fig. 1C). Expression of both Myc and HA C-terminal-tagged DGAT1 proteins in HEK-293T cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (Fig. 2A). FL-DGAT1-HA and FL-DGAT1-Myc migrated slightly slower by SDS-PAGE compared with FL-DGAT due to the presence of the additional epitope tag at the C terminus. The presence of a C-terminal epitope tag (Myc or HA) was not detrimental to DGAT1 function. In vitro DGAT activity in membranes isolated from cells expressing FL-DGAT1-HA and FL-DGAT1-Myc was similar to that of FL-DGAT1 and was ∼20-fold higher than that of untransfected cells (Fig. 2B). To determine the orientation and number of the hydrophilic loops of DGAT1, internal HA or Myc epitopes were inserted into FL-DGAT1-Myc or FL-DGAT1-HA, respectively. FL-DGAT1-Myc constructs containing an internal HA epitope between amino acids 230 and 231 (230HA), 240 and 241 (240HA), and 250 and 251 (250HA) had DGAT activities at least equal to that of FL-DGAT1-Myc (Fig. 2B). Constructs with an internal HA epitope between amino acids 129 and 130 (129HA) and 196 and 197 (196HA) of FL-DGAT1-Myc and an internal Myc tag between amino acids 165 and 166 (165Myc) and 460 and 461 (460Myc) of FL-DGAT1-HA showed increased DGAT activity compared with untransfected cells but was lower than that of FL-DGAT1(Fig. 2B). The insertion of an internal Myc epitope between amino acids 337 and 338 (337Myc) and 436 and 437 (436Myc) into FL-DGAT1-HA led to a significant decrease in DGAT activities, which were slightly above that of untransfected cells (Fig. 2B). Attempts to place epitope tags in adjacent areas were unsuccessful, indicating that these regions of DGAT1 are highly susceptible to perturbation (data not shown). To determine the orientation of the N terminus of DGAT1, protease protection assays using trypsin were performed with sealed membrane vesicles from HEK-293T cells expressing DGAT1 with an N-terminal FLAG tag (FL-DGAT1). Trypsin was chosen as it is a relatively weaker protease that cannot digest proteins within a membrane bilayer. Membrane vesicles were incubated with trypsin and then immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. Under these conditions, a 55-kDa protein corresponding to DGAT1 was detected only in the absence of trypsin (Fig. 3A, lane 1). In the presence of the protease, with or without detergent (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3), the FLAG epitope was destroyed, suggesting that the N terminus of DGAT1 was exposed to the cytosol. The integrity of membrane vesicles was confirmed by immunoblotting for the ER luminal protein, PDI. PDI could be detected both in the absence and presence of trypsin, indicating that the membrane vesicles were intact (Fig. 3A, lane 1 and 2). However, PDI was not detected when Triton X-100 was included in the reaction mix to solubilize membranes (Fig. 3A, lane 3). To determine the orientation of the C terminus of DGAT1, protease protection assays were performed using sealed membrane vesicles from HEK-293T cells expressing FL-DGAT1-HA and FL-DGAT1-Myc. In samples not treated with trypsin, the N terminus could be detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 1), and the C terminus was detected with anti-HA (Fig. 3B, lane 4) or anti-Myc (Fig. 3C, lane 4). When trypsin was included in the assay, DGAT1 could not be detected with anti-FLAG (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 2 and 3). However, both anti-HA and anti-Myc detected a protected DGAT1 fragment that was 25 kDa (∼50% of the protein) (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 5), but not when detergent was added to the reaction (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 6). Immunoblotting for PDI confirmed that the membrane vesicles were intact (Fig. 3, B and C). Protease protection assays were also performed on membrane vesicles from HEK-293T cells expressing FL-DGAT1-HA and FL-DGAT1-Myc using proteinase K with identical results of the orientation of the N and C termini of DGAT1 as trypsin (data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence was used to confirm the orientation of the N and C termini. In COS-7 cells transfected with FL-DGAT-Myc, the N-terminal FLAG epitope was detected when cellular membranes were completely permeabilized with detergent or when the plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized with digitonin (Fig. 3D, upper panel). In contrast, the C-terminal Myc epitope could only be detected when cellular membranes were permeabilized with detergent (Fig. 3D, upper panel). Integrity of ER membranes after permeabilization with digitonin was determined by probing for the ER luminal protein, PDI. PDI was only detected when cells were permeabilized with detergent and not with digitonin, indicating that the ER membranes were intact (Fig. 3D, lower panel). These results are consistent with the data from our protease protection assays and confirm that the N terminus of DGAT1 is exposed to the cytosol, whereas the C terminus is present in the ER lumen. The cytosolic orientation of the N terminus and luminal orientation of the C terminus suggested that DGAT1 has an odd number of transmembrane domains. Given the size of the C-terminal-protected fragment (25 kDa) observed in the protease protection assays, it appeared that DGAT1 also has fewer transmembrane domains than predicted in our consensus model (Fig. 1B), most likely only three. To determine the location of the transmembrane domains, protease protection assays were performed on DGAT1 constructs containing internal HA or Myc epitope tags (described in Fig. 1C and Fig. 2). Membrane vesicles prepared from HEK-293T cells expressing 129HA, 196HA, 240HA, and 165Myc were treated with trypsin with or without Triton X-100. DGAT1 in untreated samples was detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). When treated with trypsin, DGAT1 could not be detected with anti-FLAG, but the 25-kDa protected fragment in the ER lumen that was observed in Fig. 3 was detected with anti-Myc for 129HA, 196HA, and 240HA (Fig. 4A, lanes 2, 5, and 8) and with anti-HA for 165Myc (Fig. 4A, lane 11). When trypsinized samples for 129HA and 196HA were immunoblotted with anti-HA to detect the orientation of the internal HA tags, a 16-kDa protected fragment was detected (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 5). The same 16-kDa fragment was seen when 165Myc was treated with trypsin and immunoblotted with anti-Myc (Fig. 4A, lane 11). These results indicate that the first transmembrane domain of DGAT1 precedes the HA epitope inserted between amino acids 129–130 and likely resides between amino acids 97 and 118. In contrast, the internal HA epitope of 240HA was not detected in the presence of trypsin (Fig. 4A, lane 8), indicating that this region of DGAT1 had a cytosolic orientation and was not part of the 16- or 25-kDa protected fragments. Immunoblotting for PDI confirmed membrane vesicles were intact in the absence or presence of trypsin (Fig. 4A). When membrane vesicles were disrupted with Triton X-100, PDI immunoreactivity was lost. These data suggest that DGAT1 has two hydrophilic loops present in the ER lumen; that is, a 16-kDa fragment near the N terminus and a second 25-kDa fragment containing the C-terminal half of DGAT1. The identification of the large 25-kDa C-terminal protected fragment in the ER lumen of DGAT1 indicated that this region likely did not contain any transmembrane domains, although our model predicted that there could be four, between amino acids 292–312, 343–364, 439–459, and 467–484 (Fig. 1B). We generated three DGAT1 constructs containing a C-terminal HA epitope with internal Myc epitopes between each of the predicted transmembrane domains (337Myc, 436Myc, and 460Myc) (Fig. 1C). When expressed in HEK-293T cells, DGAT activity of 460Myc was similar to that of FL-DGAT (Fig. 2B). However, 337Myc and 436Myc were essentially devoid of DGAT activity, and the internal Myc epitope could not be detected for 337Myc (Fig. 2B). Attempts to place the internal tag in these three constructs in adjacent areas and retain significant activity were unsuccessful. 337Myc was not used further. We did continue to use 436Myc in protease protection assays because we could detect the internal Myc epitope. In protease protection assays, 436Myc and 460Myc were both observed with anti-FLAG in the absence but not presence of trypsin (Fig. 4B). When samples were immunoblotted after digestion of microsomes with trypsin, both anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies detected a 25-kDa protected fragment, indicating that the C-terminal region of DGAT1 resided in the ER lumen and did not contain any of the predicted transmembrane domains (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 5). Epitope tags at the N and C termini, and internal tags of 436Myc and 460Myc could not be detected when samples were incubated with detergent and trypsin (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 6). 436Myc and 460Myc had identical protease protection patterns, suggesting that the insertion of a Myc tag between amino acids 436 and 437 likely disrupted the active site of the enzyme rather than by altering its structure. The active site of DGAT has been predicted to be in this region of DGAT1 (2Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Koliwad S. Harris C. Farese Jr., R.V. J.

We show that TGF-β1 induces autophagy and protects glomerular mesangial cells from undergoing apoptosis during serum deprivation. Serum withdrawal rapidly induced autophagy within 1 h in mouse mesangial cells (MMC) as determined by increased microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) levels and punctate distribution of the autophagic vesicle-associated-form LC3-II. We demonstrate that after 1 h there was a time-dependent decrease in LC3 levels that was accompanied by induction of apoptosis, evidenced by increases in cleaved caspase 3. However, treatment with TGF-β1 resulted in induction of the autophagy protein LC3 while suppressing caspase 3 activation. TGF-β1 failed to rescue MMC from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis upon knockdown of LC3 by siRNA and in MMC from LC3 null (LC3(-/-)) mice. We show that TGF-β1 induced autophagy through TAK1 and Akt activation, and inhibition of PI3K-Akt pathway by LY294002 or dominant-negative Akt suppressed LC3 levels and enhanced caspase 3 activation. TGF-β1 also up-regulated cyclin D1 and E protein levels while down-regulating p27, thus stimulating cell cycle progression. Bafilomycin A1, but not MG132, blocked TGF-β1 down-regulation of p27, suggesting that p27 levels were regulated through autophagy. Taken together, our data indicate that TGF-β1 rescues MMC from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis via induction of autophagy through activation of the Akt pathway. The autophagic process may constitute an adaptive mechanism to glomerular injury by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting mesangial cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W1980035883,"Angiogenesis, the growth of new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, is a complex process involving endothelial cell (EC) activation, disruption of vascular basement membranes, and migration and proliferation of ECs. Glycan-mediated recognition has been proposed to play an instrumental role in mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Galectins (Gal), a family of glycan-binding proteins with affinity for β-galactosides and a conserved sequence motif, can decipher glycan-containing information and mediate cell-cell communication. Galectin-8 (Gal-8), a member of this family, is a bivalent ""tandem-repeat""-type galectin, which possesses 2 CRDs connected by a linker peptide. Here, we show that Gal-8 is endowed with proangiogeneic properties. Functional assays revealed a critical role for this lectin in the regulation of capillary-tube formation and EC migration. Moreover, Matrigel, either supplemented with Gal-8 or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), injected in mice resulted in induction of in vivo angiogenesis. Remarkably, Gal-8 was expressed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus in ECs of normal and tumor vessels. Furthermore, CD166 [activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM)] was identified as a specific Gal-8-binding partner in normal vascular ECs. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence demonstrating an essential role for Gal-8 in the regulation of angiogenesis with critical implications in tumor biology."

https://openalex.org/W2155826918,"The prion protein (PrP(C)) is highly expressed in the nervous system, and its abnormal conformer is associated with prion diseases. PrP(C) is anchored to cell membranes by glycosylphosphatidylinositol, and transmembrane proteins are likely required for PrP(C)-mediated intracellular signaling. Binding of laminin (Ln) to PrP(C) modulates neuronal plasticity and memory. We addressed signaling pathways triggered by PrP(C)-Ln interaction in order to identify transmembrane proteins involved in the transduction of PrP(C)-Ln signals. The Ln γ1-chain peptide, which contains the Ln binding site for PrP(C), induced neuritogenesis through activation of phospholipase C (PLC), Ca(2+) mobilization from intracellular stores, and protein kinase C and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activation in primary cultures of neurons from wild-type, but not PrP(C)-null mice. Phage display, coimmunoprecipitation, and colocalization experiments showed that group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1/5) associate with PrP(C). Expression of either mGluR1 or mGluR5 in HEK293 cells reconstituted the signaling pathways mediated by PrP(C)-Ln γ1 peptide interaction. Specific inhibitors of these receptors impaired PrP(C)-Ln γ1 peptide-induced signaling and neuritogenesis. These data show that group I mGluRs are involved in the transduction of cellular signals triggered by PrP(C)-Ln, and they support the notion that PrP(C) participates in the assembly of multiprotein complexes with physiological functions on neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2167834312,"Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl) is essential to the function of two human enzymes, methionine synthase (MS) and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT). The conversion of dietary Cbl to its cofactor forms, methyl-Cbl (MeCbl) for MS and adenosyl-Cbl (AdoCbl) for MUT, located in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively, requires a complex pathway of intracellular processing and trafficking. One of the processing proteins, MMAA (methylmalonic aciduria type A), is implicated in the mitochondrial assembly of AdoCbl into MUT and is defective in children from the cblA complementation group of cobalamin disorders. To characterize the functional interplay between MMAA and MUT, we have crystallized human MMAA in the GDP-bound form and human MUT in the apo, holo, and substrate-bound ternary forms. Structures of both proteins reveal highly conserved domain architecture and catalytic machinery for ligand binding, yet they show substantially different dimeric assembly and interaction, compared with their bacterial counterparts. We show that MMAA exhibits GTPase activity that is modulated by MUT and that the two proteins interact in vitro and in vivo. Formation of a stable MMAA-MUT complex is nucleotide-selective for MMAA (GMPPNP over GDP) and apoenzyme-dependent for MUT. The physiological importance of this interaction is highlighted by a recently identified homoallelic patient mutation of MMAA, G188R, which, we show, retains basal GTPase activity but has abrogated interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2001461508,"Activation of RAW264.7 cells with a lipopolysaccharide specific for the TLR4 receptor, Kdo2-lipid A (KLA), causes a large increase in cellular sphingolipids, from 1.5 to 2.6 × 109 molecules per cell in 24 h, based on the sum of subspecies analyzed by “lipidomic” mass spectrometry. Thus, this study asked the following question. What is the cause of this increase and is there a cell function connected with it? The sphingolipids arise primarily from de novo biosynthesis based on [U-13C]palmitate labeling, inhibition by ISP1 (myriocin), and an apparent induction of many steps of the pathway (according to the distribution of metabolites and microarray analysis), with the exception of ceramide, which is also produced from pre-existing sources. Nonetheless, the activated RAW264.7 cells have a higher number of sphingolipids per cell because KLA inhibits cell division; thus, the cells are larger and contain increased numbers of membrane vacuoles termed autophagosomes, which were detected by the protein marker GFP-LC3. Indeed, de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids performs an essential structural and/or signaling function in autophagy because autophagosome formation was eliminated by ISP1 in KLA-stimulated RAW264.7 cells (and mutation of serine palmitoyltransferase in CHO-LYB cells); furthermore, an anti-ceramide antibody co-localizes with autophagosomes in activated RAW264.7 cells versus the Golgi in unstimulated or ISP1-inhibited cells.

Zinc chemistry is widely exploited to drive enzymatic catalysis, organize protein structures, and mediate macromolecular interactions (2Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol.

The inward zinc concentration gradients would provide a powerful chemical driving force to draw extracellular zinc ions into the cytoplasm if a transmembrane zinc conduit would connect the external zinc availability and the high intracellular zinc binding capacity. Such a zinc-specific uptake channel has not heretofore been identified. A common assumption is that cellular zinc uptake is an active process mediated by metal transporters. In mammals, Zrt-, Irt-like protein (ZIP) 2The abbreviations used are: ZIPZrt-, Irt-like proteinsDDMn-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranosideTEAtetraethylammoniumICP-MSinductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyCDFcation diffusion facilitatorNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidBis-Tris2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. is the only zinc-specific uptake protein identified thus far (12Cousins R.J. Liuzzi J.P. Lichten L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24085-24089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Although ZIPs supply zinc to meet cellular needs for growth, aberrant ZIP expressions have been linked to uncontrolled cell growth such as that occurring in cancer (13Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Smart K. Zahari N.M. Pumford S. Ellis I.O. Robertson J.F. Nicholson R.I. Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 396-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Functionally, mammalian ZIPs promote zinc influx into the cytoplasm either from the extracellular medium or from zinc-enriched intracellular compartments (14Eide D.J. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Members of the ZIP protein family are found at all phylogenetic levels (15Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Plant, yeast, and bacterial ZIPs are relatively specific for zinc (16Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) as well as iron (17Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), and they are also implicated in transporting a broad spectrum of other transition metal ions, including Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ (18Korshunova Y.O.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To date, direct functional characterization of any ZIP homolog has been unattainable due to the technical bottleneck in overexpression and purification of ZIPs. Although none of ZIP homologs have been studied biochemically, they have been hypothesized to be ion-coupled secondary transporters (5Eide D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The assumed transport mechanism for ZIPs has largely been inferred from the observed saturable zinc uptake activities in cells expressing ZIP homologs (20Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 21Dufner-Beattie J. Langmade S.J. Wang F. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is noted, however, that zinc influx and efflux are intricately linked in a zinc flow equilibrium around homeostatic set points (23Nies D.H. Science. 2007; 317: 1695-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An elevated zinc influx may activate endogenous zinc efflux activities (24Lu M. Chai J. Fu D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1063-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), resulting in a net zinc influx in a saturable manner. In light of this potential ambiguity, the mechanism of zinc uptake by ZIPs remains unclear.

In the present study, we obtained a heterologously expressed ZIP homolog from Bordetella bronchiseptica, termed ZIPB. The purified ZIPB was reconstituted into proteoliposomes, enabling detailed kinetic analysis of ZIPB-mediated metal fluxes under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that ZIPB is a selective electrodiffusional channel. This result challenges the common assumption that cellular zinc uptake is an active process. Rather, ZIPB facilitates passive zinc uptake driven by zinc concentration gradients that are maintained by cellular zinc homeostasis. ZIPB was selected through a high throughput screening process for expression and purification of membrane proteins (25Mancia F. Love J. J. Struct. Biol. 2010; 172: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Punta M. Love J. Handelman S. Hunt J.F. Shapiro L. Hendrickson W.A. Rost B. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2009; 10: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For large scale overexpression, the ZIPB coding sequence was subcloned to pET15b with an N-terminal thrombin-cleavable hexa histidine tag. Overexpression of ZIPB was hosted in Escherichia coli C43(DE3) cells, grown in an auto-induction culture medium (27Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (3954) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and mechanically ruptured using a Microfluidizer press cell. The membrane vesicles were solubilized in a detergent buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 7% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM), 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride, 20% w/v glycerol, 1 mm CdCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, and 10 mm imidazole. His-ZIPB was purified on an Ni-NTA superflow column. The His tag was removed by overnight thrombin digestion. The resulting ZIPB was concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml and further purified by size-exclusion HPLC on a TSK 3000SWXL column, pre-equilibrated with a mobile phase containing 20 mm NaOAc, pH 4.0, 100 mm NaCl, 12.5% glycerol, 0.03% DDM, 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride, 0.02 mm ZnCl2. The molecular identity of the purified ZIPB was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis on a Voyager-DE STR operated in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) linear mode. Prior to reconstitution, HPLC-purified ZIPB, typically at ∼20 mg/ml in the HPLC buffer, was diluted 20–400-fold with 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside to reduce the DDM concentration. The protocols for functional reconstitution, encapsulation of fluorescent indicators, stopped-flow measurements, and data analysis were described previously (28Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Liposomes were made in parallel to proteoliposomes as a protein-free control. Stopped-flow experiments were carried out by mixing vesicles at a 1:1 ratio with an assay buffer at 8 °C. For measuring zinc fluxes in response to zinc concentration changes, the initial intravesicular [Zn2+] is zero, and extravesicular [Zn2+] increased from 0 to 2 mm in an assay buffer containing 50 mm K2SO4, 20 mm Bis-Tris-MES, pH 6.8. For measuring zinc fluxes in response to pH changes, the initial intravesicular [Zn2+] is zero, and extravesicular [Zn2+] was fixed at 0.5 mm. A broad pH range was buffered using 20 mm MES for pH from 5.0 to 7.0 and 20 mm Tris for pH from 7.0 to 9.0. At pH 7.0, zinc fluxes in the MES and Tris assay buffer were identical. For measuring zinc fluxes in response to membrane potential changes, 50 μm ZnSO4 was added in equilibrium inside and outside of the vesicles. The vesicles were preloaded with either 50 mm K2SO4 or 50 mm (TEA)2SO4 and then exposed to an assay buffer containing a K2SO4/(TEA)2SO4 mixture with varied K+-to-TEA+ ratio at pH 6.8. Potassium ionophore valinomycin (2 μm) and voltage indicator oxonol VI (1 μm) were added to the vesicles and assay buffers, respectively. For measuring zinc fluxes in response to the proton motive forces, vesicles at a symmetrical [Zn2+] concentration of 50 μm were preloaded with either 50 mm K2SO4 or 50 mm (TEA)2SO4. The assay buffer contained either 50 mm K2SO4 or 50 mm (TEA)2SO4, respectively. An H+/K+ exchanger nigericin was added at 2 μm to the vesicles encapsulated with both FluoZin-1 and pyranine. Metal uptake experiments were performed on 0.22-μm GS nitrocellulose filters. A metal ion as indicated was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm to an assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 50 mm K2SO4, pH 7.0, with 2 mm CaSO4 as the filter blocker. Proteoliposomes or liposomes were loaded onto filters mounted on a vacuum manifold and then overlaid with an ice-chilled, metal-containing assay buffer for 15 s at 8 °C. Next, the filters were washed with the metal-free assay buffer at an elevated pH of 9.0. The vesicles on the filter were then subject to acid digestion at 70 °C for 60 min using 60 μl of 70% nitric acid. The sample was clear of insoluble debris by a brief centrifugation, diluted with double distilled H2O to a final HNO3 concentration of 2%, and then analyzed on a PlasmaQuad 3 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. ZIP was nominated as a structural genomics target to the New York Consortium on Membrane Protein Structure (NYCOMPS). 52 bacterial and archaeal ZIP homologs were selected from a pool of 92 fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes based on a sequence similarity criterion (26Punta M. Love J. Handelman S. Hunt J.F. Shapiro L. Hendrickson W.A. Rost B. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2009; 10: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The chosen ZIP homologs were cloned, His-tagged, and overexpressed. An initial screen in a 96-well format identified 12 constructs that showed detectable protein expression by a His tag specific antibody. Scale-up expressions were followed, and proteins were partially purified by Ni-NTA affinity binding. Only 4 out of 12 constructs yielded expected protein bands on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel. This result is consistent with the general observation that ZIPs tend to be highly refractory to overexpression and purification. The level of ZIPB expression ranked third among the four positives, but ZIPB was the only homolog that remained soluble after a prolonged detergent incubation. Thus, ZIPB was singled out for large scale production. ZIPB was heterologously overexpressed in E. coli, solubilized using DDM at a detergent-to-cell mass ratio of 1/10 (w/w), and then purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 1a). Western blot analysis showed that thrombin proteolysis completely removed the His tag (Fig. 1a). Initial size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, however, indicated that the majority of the purified ZIPB formed protein aggregates. Accordingly, a collection of detergents, metal ions, and buffers in various combinations was screened for an optimal stabilizing condition. The resulting ZIPB in a stabilized form was concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml, and then subjected to preparative size-exclusion HPLC purification. The purified ZIPB showed a single monodispersed species with a retention time corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 170 KDa in complex with detergents and lipids (Fig. 1b). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the peak fraction revealed a single mass species at 31,270 Da, in agreement with the expected molecular mass for ZIPB at 31,250 Da (Fig. 1c). The protein mass in the ZIPB-detergent-lipid complex was estimated to be ∼62.9 kDa by size-exclusion HPLC coupled with in-line measurements of light scattering, refractive index, and UV absorption (29Wei Y. Li H. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39251-39259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This protein mass is approximately equal to that of a ZIPB homodimer in the detergent micelles. The HPLC-purified ZIPB was reconstituted into proteoliposomes by a detergent-mediated reconstitution method (28Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The proteoliposomes were loaded with a fluorescent zinc indicator, FluoZin-1, and then exposed to various zinc-containing assay buffers. Zinc fluxes in response to rapid zinc exposures were detected by stopped-flow fluorometry. The net zinc influx (ΔFZn) through the reconstituted ZIPB was obtained by subtracting the background zinc leakage measured from control liposomes. The background leakage was negligible when compared with the ZIPB-mediated flux. The total vesicle loading of FluoZin-1 was quantified as the maximum fluorescence change (ΔFmax) in response to detergent dissolution of vesicles that released all the encapsulated FluoZin-1 to 2 mm extravesicular Zn2+ (28Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Normalizing ΔFZn to ΔFmax resulted in a dimensionless fluorescence change, ΔFZn/ΔFmax. Fig. 2a shows typical recordings of ΔFZn/ΔFmax that rose exponentially upon rapid exposures of proteoliposomes to extravesicular zinc with increasing concentrations from 0 to 2 mm. Zn2+ influxes were measured at a fixed ZIPB-to-lipid molar ratio with varied extravesicular zinc concentrations or at a fixed extravesicular zinc concentration with varied ZIPB-to-lipid ratios. The initial rate of the fluorescence response was found to be directly proportional to the zinc concentration with no evidence of saturation up to an extravesicular zinc concentration of 2 mm (Fig. 2b). A control experiment was performed using a well characterized zinc efflux transporter, YiiP (30Wei Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33716-33724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Wei Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23492-23502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Under the same experimental conditions, YiiP exhibited the typical saturation kinetics expected for a carrier-mediated flux. Thus, the zinc flux through ZIPB was indeed nonsaturating within the physiological zinc concentration range. The rate of zinc flux normalized to the extravesicular zinc concentration also increased linearly with the ZIPB-to-lipid molar ratio within a range from 1:20,000 to 1:667 (Fig. 2c). At a higher ratio of 1:400, the normalized zinc flux rate seemed to fall off the regression line (Fig. 2c). Thus, the upper bound protein-to-lipid molar ratio for ZIPB reconstitution is between 1:667 and 1:400. This value suggested that the reconstitution of ZIPB is slightly more efficient than the membrane insertion of ATP binding cassette transporters under optimized reconstitution conditions (32Geertsma E.R. Nik Mahmood N.A. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Poolman B. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The observed first order kinetics suggested that the ZIPB-mediated zinc flux may represent passive electrodiffusion. If this is the case, a zinc flux down its concentration gradient would generate a transmembrane potential according to the Nernst equilibrium. The membrane potential was detected using a fluorescent potentiometric indicator, oxonol VI, that can respond to the membrane potential linearly under our experimental conditions (33Apell H.J. Bersch B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 903: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). An exposure of proteoliposomes to 1 mm extravesicular Zn2+ rapidly developed an inside-positive potential, as indicated by a rise of oxonol VI fluorescence (Fig. 3a). The electrogenic effect was attributed to the zinc influx because proteoliposomes preloaded with 1 mm Zn2+ in equilibrium with the extravesicular zinc concentration did not yield detectable change in oxonol VI fluorescence. The electrogenic effect seemed specific to zinc. Among a set of divalent metal ions examined, Zn2+ was the only metal ion that elicited a significant voltage response (Fig. 3a). Within an extravesicular zinc concentration ranging from 0.25 to 4.5 mm, zinc influxes rapidly filled up the proteoliposomes to the maximum filling capacity, corresponding to an intravesicular zinc concentration of 0.15 mm, as estimated according to the quasi-stationary ΔFZn/ΔFmax readings (Fig. 2a). Apparently, zinc influxes built up membrane potentials in opposition to chemical driving forces of the zinc concentration gradients. Accordingly, the oxonol VI response was found to be linear to the zinc driving force, (RT/FZ)ln[(Zn2+)out/(Zn2+)in], where R, T, and F are thermodynamic constants, and Z is the ionic valence of the permeant ion (Fig. 3b). An internal calibration of the oxonol VI response was performed using a series of potassium concentration gradients down a potassium ionophore valinomycin (34Pressman B.C. Harris E.J. Jagger W.S. Johnson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1967; 58: 1949-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Increasing [K+]out from 0.5 mm to 5 mm yielded a linear increase of the quasi-stationary oxonol VI response (Fig. 3b). Under the identical experimental conditions, except that the monovalent K+ was in place of the divalent Zn2+, a [K+]in of 0.3 mm was expected to reach the proteoliposome filling capacity. The slope of the K+ regression line approximately doubled that of the Zn2+ regression line (Fig. 3b), as predicted by a 2-fold valence difference of the Nernst equation. These observations draw a parallel between ZIPB and a potassium ionophore that functions as an ion-selective electrodiffusional pore. Further supporting evidence for electrodiffusional fluxes through ZIPB came from simultaneous measurements of zinc fluxes and membrane potentials using FluoZin-1 and oxonol VI, respectively. Proteoliposomes were loaded with 50 μm Zn2+ in equilibrium with the extravesicular Zn2+ concentration. At this symmetrical zinc concentration, zinc fluxes were driven by imposition of transmembrane potentials, which were generated by applying K+ transmembrane gradients across valinomycin. Bidirectional K+ concentration gradients were elicited by rapidly exposing proteoliposomes to an assay buffer with varied K+-to-TEA+ concentration ratios. As shown in Fig. 4a, outward K+ gradients induced negative oxonol VI responses accompanied by increases of the FluoZin-1 fluorescence. The concurrent fluorescence changes indicated that an inside-negative membrane potential induced a zinc influx. Conversely, inward K+ gradients triggered inside-positive membrane potentials, which drove zinc effluxes (Fig. 4b). A correlation between the quasi-stationary FluoZin-1 and oxonol VI responses showed a linear relationship between the zinc fluxes and the membrane potentials (Fig. 4c). This ohmic behavior at a symmetrical zinc concentration obeys the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation with an underlying mechanism ascribed to passive electrodiffusion (35Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 445-449Google Scholar). Characterization of voltage dependence of zinc flux under an asymmetrical condition was limited by a small FluoZin-1 detection window set by a lower bound detection limit of FluoZin-1 and an upper bound limit of its linear range (28Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Zinc fluxes through ZIPB were measured at six different temperatures from 3 to 18 °C (Fig. 5). The initial rate of zinc flux induced by 0.5 mm extravesicular zinc showed a weak temperature dependence, corresponding to an activation energy of 8.2 ± 0.8 kJ/mol. This value is significantly lower than the typical range of activation energies for membrane transporters, e.g. 50–60 kJ/mol for a Na/Ca exchanger (36Elias C.L. Xue X.H. Marshall C.R. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C993-C1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 81 kJ/mol for transport of Cs+ through an organic cation transporter rOCT2 (37Schmitt B.M. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The temperature-dependent data of ZIPB are compatible with an electrodiffusional process that requires minimal conformational changes. H+ and K+ are the only two physiological ion species besides Zn2+ in the assay buffer. Zinc flux remained unchanged by a complete substitution of K+ with TEA+, but was reduced to the background level by alkalinization of the assay buffer to pH 9.0. The pH dependence of ZIPB was examined using aliquots of proteoliposomes, pre-equilibrated at a pH ranging from 5 to 9. The initial rate of Zn2+ influx in response to 0.5 mm extravesicular Zn2+ increased progressively with the H+ concentration (Fig. 6a). The observed [H+] dependence was fit to the Hill equation, yielding a K0.5 = 53.1 ± 3.8 nm and a stoichiometry n = 1.0 ± 0.1. A near unity n value suggested a noncooperative proton effect. At pH 6.8 and at a symmetrical Zn2+ concentration of 50 μm, a transmembrane H+ gradient was applied to proteoliposomes using an electroneutral H+/K+ exchanger, nigericin, that can convert an imposed K+ gradient to a proton gradient (38Negulescu P.A. Machen T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 38-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Changes in intravesicular [Zn2+] and [H+] were monitored simultaneously by dual encapsulation of FluoZin-1 and a pH indicator, pyranine (39Kano K. Fendler J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 509: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). An inward K+ gradient, corresponding to inside 0 mm K+ + 100 mm TEA+ and outside 50 mm K+ + 50 mm TEA+, caused an increase in pyranine fluorescence, whereas an outward K+ gradient, corresponding to inside 100 mm K+ + 0 mm TEA+ and outside 50 mm K+ + 50 mm TEA+, elicited a pyranine response in the opposite direction (Fig. 6b). No zinc flux was detected in response to the proton gradient in either direction. In contrast, under the identical experimental conditions, robust bidirectional Cd2+ fluxes were reported through a proton-coupled zinc efflux transporter, ZitB (28Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Taken together, ZIPB-mediated zinc flux is dependent upon pH, but independent of the proton motive force. Metal selectivity was directly assessed using ICP-MS. This mass spectrometric approach allows quantitative multi-element analysis. The metal uptake reaction was performed on a membrane filter on which the proteoliposomes were washed free of extravesicular metal ion by a high pH assay buffer that minimized metal backflow through ZIPB. A 15-s exposure of the protein-free liposomes to metal ions at an extravesicular concentration of 0.2 mm yielded only background level signals, whereas ZIPB proteoliposomes under the same experimental condition accumulated Zn2+ 12-fold above the background (Fig. 7). Of the six additional metal ions examined, Cd2+ was the only one that showed significant accumulation into proteoliposomes, although the rate of Cd2+ accumulation seemed slower than that of Zn2+. The ZIPB-mediated Cd2+ influx was confirmed by stopped-flow FluoZin-1 fluorescence measurements. Moreover, Zn2+ and Cd2+ uptakes were mutually inhibited by each other but not by any other metal ions examined. This observation suggested a competition between Zn2+ and Cd2+ for ZIPB. It was noted that the Cd2+ influx did not yield an oxonol VI fluorescence change (Fig. 3a). Intriguingly, a membrane potential induced by an inward potassium concentration gradient across valinomycin was found to drive Cd2+ efflux through ZIPB at a symmetrical Cd2+ concentration. The mechanism underpinning the difference between the electrogenic effects of Zn2+ and Cd2+ influx is unclear. The experiments described herein demonstrate that the purified ZIPB protein alone can mediate a transmembrane zinc flux that is nonsaturable, electrogenic, and voltage-dependent. The zinc equilibrium potential exhibits a Nernst relationship predicted for divalent Zn2+ with reference to monovalent K+. The voltage dependence of the zinc flux also follows the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation at a symmetrical zinc concentration. These data provide strong evidence that the ZIPB-mediated zinc flux truly represents electrodiffusion through a zinc-permeant channel. All ZIPs identified thus far promote zinc influx into the cytoplasm where zinc is buffered to extremely low levels around homeostatic set points (40Finney L.A. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2003; 300: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). From an energetic standpoint, ZIPB may provide a zinc conduit in the membrane barrier that allows zinc to flow into cells down the concentration gradient maintained by cellular zinc homeostasis. The presence of an inside-negative membrane potential would further aid zinc electrodiffusion. Given the zinc homeostatic concentration gradients in living cells, the electrodiffusion ascribed to ZIPB may represent a general mechanism by which cells acquire zinc to satisfy their metabolic needs for growth. Most ZIPs are eight-spanner membrane proteins and share a transmembrane topology with both N termini and C termini located on the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane. Highly conserved sequences clustered around the putative transmembrane segment 4 define a signature sequence for the ZIP family (15Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The signature sequence is well preserved in ZIPB (Fig. 8), indicating that ZIPB is a bona fide member of the ZIP family. ZIPB is a structural genomic target selected from a large collection of microbial ZIP homologs. Despite its prokaryotic origin, ZIPB also shows a significant homology to some eukaryotic counterparts, e.g. a 38% sequence identity with human ZIP11 for 160 residues in the C-terminal half of the proteins (Fig. 8). This observation agrees with the notion that the C-terminal half of ZIP homologs is better conserved than the N-terminal half (15Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Until now, the selectivity of ZIPs has been inferred from indirect analyses of genetic complementation and mutant phenotypes (16Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 17Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Our ICP-MS data provide direct evidence that ZIPB is permeable to Zn2+ and Cd2+ but not Fe2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+. ZIPB shares a common metal selectivity with YiiP, a metal efflux transporter in the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family (41Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The purified YiiP is selective for Zn2+ and Cd2+ against Fe2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ (30Wei Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33716-33724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although YiiP exhibited a ferrous tolerance phenotype in a mutant E. coli strain (42Grass G. Otto M. Fricke B. Haney C.J. Rensing C. Nies D.H. Munkelt D. Arch. Microbiol. 2005; 183: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Both zinc and cadmium are group 12 transition metals. They prefer tetrahedral coordination, whereas all rejected metals favor higher coordination numbers, belonging to groups 7 through 11 of the periodic table. It seems plausible that ZIPB discriminates among various metal ions based on their coordination chemistries. This coordination-based selective mechanism is supported by the crystal structure of YiiP, which revealed a zinc-occupied tetrahedral coordination site in the zinc translocation pathway (43Lu M. Fu D. Science. 2007; 317: 1746-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A shared metal selectivity between YiiP and ZIPB suggests a recurring structural theme in which a zinc ion may obligatorily bind to a tetrahedral coordination site in ZIPB during its passage through the membrane. Cellular zinc homeostasis critically depends on the flux equilibrium between zinc uptake through ZIPs and zinc efflux through CDFs (44Sekler I. Sensi S.L. Hershfinkel M. Silverman W.F. Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). At present, overexpression of eukaryotic zinc transporters remains technically challenging. The bacterial YiiP and ZIPB serve as prototypes for CDFs and ZIPs, respectively. CDFs utilize the proton motive force to actively pump zinc out of the cytoplasm (28Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 45Ohana E. Hoch E. Keasar C. Kambe T. Yifrach O. Hershfinkel M. Sekler I. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17677-17686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas ZIPs operate passively in an opposite direction (5Eide D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The uphill pumping of zinc in YiiP is driven by a downhill flow of protons, whereas zinc passage in ZIPB is independent of the proton motive force. Previous work suggested that bicarbonate may stimulate the zinc uptake activity of hZIP2 in K562 erythroleukemia cells (20Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5560-5564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Our data showed, however, that ZIPB is fully active in the absence of any physiological ion except for proton. Zinc flux measurements also showed no evidence of stimulatory effects on ZIPB by bicarbonate and other common organic anions (Fig. 9). Rather, phosphate, citrate, and pyrophosphate significantly reduced the zinc flux rate in a concentration-dependent manner. The rank order of apparent dissociation constants for phosphate, citrate, and pyrophosphate is consistent with the expected rank order for their stability constants for zinc. Our data thus suggest that the observed inhibitory effects are likely attributed to metal chelation effects. The ZIPB-mediated zinc flux is nonsaturating with respect to a zinc concentration up to 2 mm. Nevertheless, the zinc flux through ZIPB is extremely slow in comparison with the potassium ion flux in potassium channels. The marked difference in ion flux rates may reflect the physiological role that ZIPB plays in zinc homeostasis as opposed to transient cell signaling. Interestingly, a direct comparison of zinc flux rates for ZIPB and YiiP at 2 mm extravesicular zinc showed that ZIPB was considerably slower than YiiP in transporting zinc ions at physiological conditions. The slower zinc flow in ZIPB likely allows the putative zinc coordination site to operate under its saturation limit, thus giving rise to nonsaturating kinetics. The restricted zinc flow further implies channel constriction(s) that may exist along the zinc conduit. At present, structures of ZIPB and any other ZIP homologs are unknown. The purification of ZIPB in a functional form lays the groundwork for structural analysis of an archetypal ZIP homolog.

https://openalex.org/W1966748929,"Arginine decarboxylases (ADCs; EC 4.1.1.19) from four different protein fold families are important for polyamine biosynthesis in bacteria, archaea, and plants. Biosynthetic alanine racemase fold (AR-fold) ADC is widespread in bacteria and plants. We report the discovery and characterization of an ancestral form of the AR-fold ADC in the bacterial Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes phyla. The ancestral AR-fold ADC lacks a large insertion found in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and plant AR-fold ADC and is more similar to the lysine biosynthetic enzyme <i>meso</i>-diaminopimelate decarboxylase, from which it has evolved. An <i>E. coli</i> acid-inducible ADC belonging to the aspartate aminotransferase fold (AAT-fold) is involved in acid resistance but not polyamine biosynthesis. We report here that the acid-inducible AAT-fold ADC has evolved from a shorter, ancestral biosynthetic AAT-fold ADC by fusion of a response regulator receiver domain protein to the N terminus. Ancestral biosynthetic AAT-fold ADC appears to be limited to firmicute bacteria. The phylogenetic distribution of different forms of ADC distinguishes bacteria from archaea, euryarchaeota from crenarchaeota, double-membraned from single-membraned bacteria, and firmicutes from actinobacteria. Our findings extend to eight the different enzyme forms carrying out the activity described by EC 4.1.1.19. ADC gene clustering reveals that polyamine biosynthesis employs diverse and exchangeable synthetic modules. We show that in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, ADC and polyamines are essential for biofilm formation, and this appears to be an ancient, evolutionarily conserved function of polyamines in bacteria. Also of relevance to human health, we found that arginine decarboxylation is the dominant pathway for polyamine biosynthesis in human gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2080074381,"The environmental toxin TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, dioxin) produces diverse toxic effects including a lethal wasting syndrome whose hallmark is suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis. All TCDD toxicities require activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor. Whereas the mechanism for AHR induction of target genes is well understood, it is not known how AHR activation produces any TCDD toxicity. This report identifies for the first time an AHR target gene, TiPARP (TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, PARP7) that can mediate a TCDD toxicity, i.e. suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis. TCDD suppressed hepatic glucose production, expression of key gluconeogenic genes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and NAD(+) levels, and increased PARP activity and TiPARP expression. TCDD also increased acetylation and ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1 α (PGC1α), a coactivator of PEPCK and G6Pase transcription. TiPARP overexpression reproduced TCDD effects on glucose output and NAD(+) levels whereas TiPARP silencing diminished them. TiPARP overexpression also increased PGC1α acetylation and decreased PGC1α levels. In contrast, silencing of cytochromes P450 (CYP) 1A, main AHR-induced genes, did not alter TCDD suppression of gluconeogenesis. The vitamin B3 constituent, nicotinamide (NAM), prevented TCDD suppression of glucose output, NAD(+), and gluconeogenic genes and stabilized PGC1α. The corrective effects of NAM could be attributed to increased NAD(+) levels and suppression of AHR target gene induction. The results reveal that TiPARP can mediate a TCDD effect, that the AHR is linked to PGC1α function and stability and that NAM has novel AHR antagonist activity."

Catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) conjugated with antibodies to platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) bind specifically to endothelium and inhibit effects of corresponding ROS, H2O2, and superoxide anion. In this study, anti-PECAM/SOD, but not anti-PECAM/catalase or nontargeted enzymes, including polyethylene glycol (PEG)-SOD, inhibited 2- to 3-fold VCAM expression caused by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1β, and lipopolysaccharide. Anti-PECAM/SOD, but not nontargeted counterparts, accumulated in vascular endothelium after intravenous injection, localized in endothelial endosomes, and inhibited by 70% lipopolysaccharide-caused VCAM-1 expression in mice. Anti-PECAM/SOD colocalized with EEA-1-positive endothelial vesicles and quenched ROS produced in response to TNF. Inhibitors of NADPH oxidase and anion channel ClC3 blocked TNF-induced VCAM expression, affirming that superoxide produced and transported by these proteins, respectively, mediates inflammatory signaling. Anti-PECAM/SOD abolished VCAM expression caused by poly(I:C)-induced activation of toll-like receptor 3 localized in intracellular vesicles. These results directly implicate endosomal influx of superoxide in endothelial inflammatory response and suggest that site-specific interception of this signal attained by targeted delivery of anti-PECAM/SOD into endothelial endo-somes may have anti-inflammatory effects.—Shuvaev, V.

https://openalex.org/W2041150746,"Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is a typical serine/threonine kinase consisting of α and β subunits and has been implicated in many cellular and developmental processes. In this study, we demonstrate that CK2 is a positive regulator of the Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction pathway. We found that inactivation of CK2 by CK2β RNAi enhances the loss-of-Hh wing phenotype induced by a dominant negative form of Smoothened (Smo). CK2β RNAi attenuates Hh-induced Smo accumulation and down-regulates Hh target gene expression, whereas increasing CK2 activity by coexpressing CK2α and CK2β increases Smo accumulation and induces ectopic Hh target gene expression. We identified the serine residues in Smo that can be phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro. Mutating these serine residues attenuates the ability of Smo to transduce high level Hh signaling activity in vivo. Furthermore, we found that CK2 plays an additional positive role downstream of Smo by regulating the stability of full-length Cubitus interruptus (Ci). CK2β RNAi promotes Ci degradation whereas coexpressing CK2α and CK2β increases the half-life of Ci. We showed that CK2 prevents Ci ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Thus, CK2 promotes Hh signaling activity by regulating multiple pathway components."
https://openalex.org/W2094095960,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome harbors a striking number (>40) of toxin-antitoxin systems. Among them are at least seven MazF orthologs, designated MazF-mt1 through MazF-mt7, four of which have been demonstrated to function as mRNA interferases that selectively target mRNA for cleavage at distinct consensus sequences. As is characteristic of all toxin-antitoxin systems, each of the mazF-mt toxin genes is organized in an operon downstream of putative antitoxin genes. However, only one of the seven putative upstream antitoxins (designated MazE-mt1 through MazE-mt7) has significant sequence similarity to Escherichia coli MazE, the cognate antitoxin for E. coli MazF.

We tested a spectrum of pair-wise combinations of cognate and noncognate Mtb toxin-antitoxins using in vivo toxicity and rescue experiments along with in vitro interaction experiments. Surprisingly, we uncovered several examples of noncognate toxin-antitoxin association, even among different families (e.g. MazF toxins and VapB antitoxins).

Tuberculosis is a widespread disease in the developing world—at least one third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) 4The abbreviations used are: MtbMycobacterium tuberculosisIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosideNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidNRPnonreplicating persistentTAtoxin-antitoxinTFtrigger factor.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid nonreplicating persistent toxin-antitoxin trigger factor. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules are specialized operons comprising adjacent antitoxin and toxin genes that are present in free-living bacteria (3Buts L. Lah J. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Loris R.

The toxin and its cognate antitoxin protein form a stable protein complex; however, the antitoxin is more labile than the toxin protein. When cellular conditions lead to a decrease in the amount of antitoxin, freed toxin is able to act on its intracellular target. Expression of Escherichia coli TA modules leads to cell death (6Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) that is preceded by a dormant state (7Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); the latter has been linked to persistence (8Falla T.J. Chopra I. Antimicrob.

Dormancy and persistence are properties associated with latent tuberculosis infection (12Höner zu Bentrup K. Russell D.G.

However, the biochemical activities and physiological roles of the many Mtb TA systems are not yet understood. Therefore, it is unclear whether TA systems contribute to tuberculosis latency. The ability of TA systems to mediate a reversible state of growth arrest was discovered during the study of the E. coli MazF toxin (derived from the mazEF TA module) and other TA systems (15Pedersen K. Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). MazF is a ssRNA- and sequence-specific endoribonuclease that cuts before or after the first A at ACA sequences in mRNA (16Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hara H. Kato I. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3143-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). MazF expression in E. coli leads to a type of suspended animation called “quasi-dormancy”, where cell growth is arrested but the cells retain the capacity for full metabolic activity (7Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, this state was found to exist only for a short window of time after MazF induction and appears to facilitate survival during periods of stress (18Amitai S. Yassin Y. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8295-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Kolodkin-Gal I. Hazan R. Gaathon A. Carmeli S. Engelberg-Kulka H. Science. 2007; 318: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although E. coli possesses a single mazEF TA module, there are at least seven MazF counterparts in M. tuberculosis (4Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), of which at least four of the seven MazF-mt toxins function as mRNA interferases (i.e. sequence-specific endoribonucleases that exclusively target mRNA) (20Zhu L. Phadtare S. Nariya H. Ouyang M. Husson R.N. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Zhu L. Zhang Y. Teh J.S. Zhang J. Connell N. Rubin H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18638-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All four of the MazF toxins characterized to date (MazF-mt1, -mt3, -mt6, and -mt7) have different sequence specificities, recognizing three- or five-base consensus sequences. MazF-mt1 preferentially cleaves mRNA between U and A in UAC triplet sequences (5′-U↓AC-3′), whereas MazF-mt6 preferentially cleaves U-rich regions with the degenerate consensus sequence of 5′-(U/C)U↓(A/U)C(U/C)-3′ (21Zhu L. Zhang Y. Teh J.S. Zhang J. Connell N. Rubin H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18638-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). MazF-mt3 cleaves RNA at 5′-UU↓CCU-3′ and 5′-CU↓CCU-3′, whereas MazF-mt7 cleaves at 5′-U↓CGCU-3′ (20Zhu L. Phadtare S. Nariya H. Ouyang M. Husson R.N. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, MazF family members in Mtb exhibit a range of cleavage specificities that are proposed to alter protein expression through differential mRNA degradation, some result in extensive mRNA cleavage whereas others target selected mRNAs for cleavage (20Zhu L. Phadtare S. Nariya H. Ouyang M. Husson R.N. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this work, we used two Mtb MazF family members, MazF-mt1 and MazF-mt3, to dissect regulation of toxin activity in this pathogen. Surprisingly, we discovered that the MazF-mt3 protein (and to a lesser extent, MazF-mt1) could physically interact with other “noncognate” antitoxins (MazF toxins-VapB antitoxins) in addition to the protein product of its upstream gene (its cognate antitoxin). Likewise, we also documented noncognate interactions between VapC toxins and a MazE antitoxins. These interactions were physiologically significant because the noncognate antitoxins were also able to reduce toxicity when co-expressed in an E. coli host. Taken together, these results bring to light the possibility of significant cross-talk among Mtb TA system families, resulting in a network of toxins whose activities may modulate translation (or other essential cellular processes) in response to environmental cues. The E. coli strains BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and BW25113 (22Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) were used for recombinant protein expression and in vivo toxicity and rescue experiments, respectively. The VapB-mt24 (Rv0599c), VapB-mt25 (Rv2595), MazE-mt1 (Rv2801A), and MazE-mt3 (Rv1991A) open reading frames were PCR-amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA using primers containing 5′-NdeI-BamHI-3′ ends and cloned into the corresponding sites of the IPTG-inducible plasmid pINIII (23Nakamura K.

Plasmids pIN-VapB-mt24, pIN-VapB-mt25, pIN-MazE-mt1, and pIN-MazE-mt3 were then digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pET28a (Novagen) to create pET28a-VapB-mt24, pET28a-VapB-mt25, pET28a-MazE-mt1, and pET28a-MazE-mt3. The VapC-mt24 (Rv0598c), VapC-mt25 (Rv2596), MazF-mt1 (Rv2801c), and MazF-mt3 (Rv1991c) open reading frames were PCR-amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA using primers with 5′-NdeI-BamHI-3′ ends and ligated into the corresponding sites of pET21c (Novagen) to create pET21c-VapC-mt24, pET21c-VapC-mt25, pET21c-MazF-mt1, and pET21c-MazF-mt3. The pBAD33 plasmid was used to facilitate tight, arabinose-regulated toxin expression (22Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar). pET21c-MazF-mt1 and pET21c-MazF-mt3 were cut with XbaI and HindIII and ligated into the corresponding sites of pBAD33 to create pBAD-MazF-mt1 and pBAD-MazF-mt3. pET21c-MazF-mt1, pET21c-MazF-mt3, pET21c-VapC-mt24, and pET21c-VapC-mt25 were each digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the toxin-containing DNA fragment was ligated into the corresponding sites in the pCold-PST vector (25Kobayashi H. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 5356-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to create the respective protein S-tagged toxins. Plasmid pCold-TF-MazE-mt1 was constructed after digestion of pET28a-MazE-mt1 with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites in the pCold-TF vector (Takara-Bio, Inc.) to express MazE-mt1 fused to trigger factor (TF), a ribosome-associated chaperone protein that facilitates co-translational folding of nascent polypeptides. Thus, the TF tag facilitated the expression of soluble MazE-mt1 by promoting correct protein folding. The accuracy of all DNA fragments synthesized by PCR was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. PST-MazF-mt1, PST-MazF-mt3, PST-VapC-mt24, and PST-VapC-mt25 proteins tagged at the N terminus were purified from the BL21(DE3) strain carrying pCold-PST-MazF-mt1, pCold-PST-MazF-mt3, pCold-PST-VapC-mt24, or pCold-PST-VapC-mt25, respectively, using myxospores as described previously (25Kobayashi H. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 5356-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression of the protein S-tagged proteins was induced at an A600 of 0.6 by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mm and continuing to grow the cells at 15 °C for 16 h. The cells were then harvested, lysed by sonication, and incubated with myxospores in 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol at 4 °C for 1 h to facilitate binding of the protein S-tagged proteins to the myxospores. TF-MazE-mt1 protein tagged at the N terminus was purified from the BL21(DE3) strain carrying pCold-TF-MazE-mt1 using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The N-terminal TF tag was removed by digestion with thrombin (Sigma). MazE-mt1 was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose Fast Flow and SP-Sepharose Fast Flow FPLC column chromatography (GE Healthcare). As with the E. coli MazE-MazF TA system (where MazE is the antitoxin for MazF and is positioned upstream of the toxin), the genes encoding each M. tuberculosis MazF toxin are co-localized with an upstream gene in an apparent operon (4Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 21Zhu L. Zhang Y. Teh J.S. Zhang J. Connell N. Rubin H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18638-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have designated the putative antitoxins upstream of MazF-mt1 through MazF-mt7 as MazE-mt1 through MazE-mt7, respectively (Fig. 1A). It is not known why the Mtb genome harbors so many MazF counterparts. Mtb MazF toxins are clearly orthologs of E. coli MazF because ∼20–45% of their amino acids are either identical or similar upon alignment (+1 or greater using the blosum62 matrix) (21Zhu L. Zhang Y. Teh J.S. Zhang J. Connell N. Rubin H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18638-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the putative MazE-mt antitoxins share <20% similarity with E. coli MazE (except for MazE-mt6; 26% similarity). Instead, we found that M. tuberculosis contained two other apparent TA modules encoding antitoxin proteins with 27 and 37% similarity to E. coli MazE (Fig. 1B). Curiously, these two antitoxins were upstream of genes encoding two apparent VapC toxins, which we designated VapC-mt24 and VapC-mt25 (Fig. 1C). These two VapC genes were not among the 23 Mtb VapC family members identified previously (4Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). However, as with all other VapC family members, they contain a PIN (PilT N terminus) domain. PIN domains were originally identified in a bacterial protein involved in pili synthesis. All PIN domain proteins in Eubacteria and Archaea are ∼140 amino acids in length and have four highly conserved acidic amino acids plus a fifth residue that is either a serine or threonine that form the Mg2+- or Mn2+-binding active site, highlighted in Fig. 1C (26Arcus V.L. Rainey P.B. Turner S.J. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic proteins contain PIN domains within larger proteins. Although the precise function of the PIN domain has not yet been determined, it has been suggested that it is associated with nuclease activity based on the properties and structural features of PIN domain proteins in Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, and eukaryotes (26Arcus V.L. Rainey P.B. Turner S.J. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As with MazF, it is not known why Mtb possesses such an abundance of VapBC modules. However, by convention all antitoxin genes upstream of Mtb VapC toxins are called VapB. Therefore, even though the genes upstream of VapC-mt24 and VapC-mt25 are more similar to E. coli MazE than any other gene in Mtb, we will refer to them as VapB-mt24 and VapB-mt25 in accordance with established nomenclature. We tested whether the genes upstream of mazF-mt1, mazF-mt3, vapC-mt24, and vapC-mt25 functioned as antitoxins by performing in vivo toxicity and rescue experiments in E. coli. We were able to use E. coli as the host because we demonstrated previously that both MazF-mt1 and MazF-mt3 are toxic in this background (21Zhu L. Zhang Y. Teh J.S. Zhang J. Connell N. Rubin H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18638-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). BW25113 E. coli cells containing an arabinose-inducible plasmid expressing MazF-mt1 or MazF-mt3 were transformed with a second plasmid that enabled IPTG-inducible co-expression of one of four different antitoxins (pIN-MazE-mt1, pIN-MazE-mt3, pIN-VapB-mt24, or pIN-VapB-mt25). We used these strains to perform plate toxicity and rescue experiments with the various toxin-antitoxin combinations. For MazF-mt1 (Fig. 2A), no growth was observed when we used 0.02% arabinose to induce toxin expression. In comparison, a control strain that contained only pBAD and pIN vectors in BW25113 cells grew normally. However, when the putative cognate antitoxin MazE-mt1 was co-induced with the MazF-mt1 toxin on plates containing 1 mm IPTG plus 0.02% arabinose, cell growth was completely restored. Therefore, although not similar to E. coli MazE, MazE-mt1 functioned as an antitoxin for MazF-mt1. When the analogous experiment was performed with MazF-mt1 and the VapB-mt24 or VapB-mt25 noncognate antitoxins, growth was observed, but the colony sizes were small relative to rescue with the cognate antitoxin. We were unable to assess the effect of co-induction of MazF-mt1 with MazE-mt3 using this approach. Inexplicably, we were unable to recover BW25113 transformants containing both pBAD-MazF-mt1 and pIN-MazE-mt3 plasmids. Overall, these in vivo rescue experiments demonstrated that the toxic effect of MazF-mt1 could be fully neutralized by its cognate antitoxin MazE-mt1 and partially (because normal growth was not reconstituted) by either of the two noncognate VapB-mt24 and VapB-mt25 antitoxins. Similar plate toxicity and rescue experiments were also carried out upon induction of the MazF-mt3 toxin using 0.02% arabinose. Consistent with published observations using high arabinose (0.2%) to induce the toxin, MazF-mt3 expression did not completely inhibit growth on plates (21Zhu L. Zhang Y. Teh J.S. Zhang J. Connell N. Rubin H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18638-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). However, a scorable phenotype, very weak growth on plates, was reproducibly observed, enabling us to assess rescue. BW25113 cells containing pBAD-MazF-mt3 were co-transformed with one of the following plasmids: pIN-MazE-mt1, pIN-MazE-mt3, pIN-VapB-mt24, or pIN-VapB-mt25. When we induced any one of the four antitoxins (cognate or noncognate) with the MazF-mt3 toxin, normal growth was observed (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that the toxic effect of MazF-mt3 could be reversed by co-expression with its cognate antitoxin, MazE-mt3, or with either noncognate antitoxin MazE-mt1, VapB-mt24 or VapB-mt25. We next tested whether physical interactions between the same toxin and antitoxin combinations shown in Fig. 2 could substantiate our in vivo rescue results using pulldown experiments with either His-tagged proteins or protein S-tagged proteins (protein S is a major spore coat protein from Myxococcus xanthus). Expression of Mtb TA toxins in E. coli is typically challenging. We have recently demonstrated that addition of the N-terminal protein S-tag (comprising two tandem N-terminal domains of protein S) enhances expression levels and protein solubility (25Kobayashi H. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 5356-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) when they are expressed at 15 °C from a vector derived from the pCold vectors developed in our laboratory (27Qing G. Ma L.C. Khorchid A. Swapna G.V. Mal T.K. Takayama M.M. Xia B. Phadtare S. Ke H. Acton T. Montelione G.T. Ikura M. Inouye M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The addition of the 20-kDa protein S-tag also helps us to distinguish the toxin from the antitoxin on stained protein gels easily because all toxins and antitoxins have low molecular masses (∼10 kDa) whose mobilities often overlap. Protein S binds tightly to the surface of myxospores in the presence of Ca2+ (28Inouye M. Inouye S. Zusman D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Inouye S. Harada W. Zusman D. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 678-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a recombinant protein fused to protein S can be affinity-purified using myxospores. We first demonstrated that untagged MazE-mt1 was able to bind protein S-tagged MazF-mt1 protein after myxospore affinity purification (Fig. 3A, lane 1); this interaction was consistent with our results in Fig. 2A. However, using the same analysis, we did not detect interactions between MazE-mt1 and the three other noncognate toxins (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). Next, we tested whether three individual His-tagged antitoxin proteins, MazE-mt3, VapB-mt24, and VapB-mt25, could interact with cognate or noncognate protein S-tagged toxins by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Fig. 3B). This was performed by first incubating the purified His-tagged antitoxin with Ni-NTA resin followed by addition of the purified protein S-tagged toxin (without a His-tag); after further incubation and washing to remove any noninteracting protein, the proteins retained on the Ni-NTA resin were visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. As expected, we observed interactions between the cognate toxin and antitoxin pairs (Fig. 3B, arrows to the left of the band in lane 3 (MazE-mt3 antitoxin with MazF-mt3 toxin), lane 9 (VapB-mt24 antitoxin with VapC-mt24 toxin), and lane 15 (VapB-mt25 antitoxin with VapC-mt25 toxin)). Notably, we also detected four noncognate toxin-antitoxin interactions (Fig. 3B, star to the left of the band in lane 4 (MazE-mt3 with VapC-mt24), lane 5 (MazE-mt3 with VapC-mt25), lane 8 (VapB-mt24 with MazF-mt3), and lane 10 (VapB-mt24 with VapC-mt25)). We did not detect an interaction between PST-MazF-mt3 and (His)6VapB-mt25 (Fig. 3B, lane 13) even though expression of VapB-mt25 can neutralize the toxicity of MazF-mt3 in E. coli (Fig. 2B). The reason for this is unclear; however, it could be due to the instability of the protein complex in vitro or steric hindrance stemming from the presence of the protein S-tags and/or His-tags. Fig. 4 summarizes the data obtained in this study. In general, it appears that the in vivo rescue experiments enabled the detection of interactions that may not be as stable under nonphysiological conditions. Overall, our results clearly demonstrate that noncognate toxins and antitoxins are able to associate both in vivo and in vitro. We mined published gene-profiling studies for supporting evidence that one or more of the in vitro and/or in vivo interactions that we discovered were physiologically relevant in Mtb. We were able to consistently identify only six of the eight Mtb protein-coding sequences related to our study (excluding MazE-mt1/Rv2801A and MazE-mt3/Rv1991A). These two antitoxin genes were among 82 newly identified protein-coding sequences (30Camus J.C. Pryor M.J. Médigue C. Cole S.T. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2967-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) absent from the original annotation of the Mtb genome (31Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C.

Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6555) Google Scholar); consequently, they are not listed in many published microarray data sets. Interestingly, we found that the steady-state levels of MazF-mt3 and VapB-mt24 mRNAs were elevated in Mtb cells subjected to gradual oxygen limitation (32Muttucumaru D.G. Roberts G. Hinds J. Stabler R.A. Parish T. Tuberculosis. 2004; 84: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) in a sealed, stirred culture according to the Wayne model (33Wayne L.G. Hayes L.G. Infect.

This slow depletion enables Mtb cells to adapt and survive anaerobic conditions, thus modeling the transition of Mtb cells from active growth to the nonreplicating persistent (NRP) state characteristic of granulomas. Physiologically, NRP is divided into two stages: NRP1 and NRP2. Mtb cells enter NRP1 when the oxygen concentration reaches 1% of normal saturation (microaerophilic conditions), resulting in slow growth. Progression to NRP2 occurs when the oxygen concentration reaches 0.06% of normal saturation (anaerobic conditions) and growth ceases. The NRP state has many parallels to the dormant state caused by the action of TA toxins in E. coli.TABLE 1Toxin and antitoxin mRNA expression levels from Muttucumaru et al. (32Muttucumaru D.G.

Parish T. Tuberculosis. 2004; 84: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Only the noncognate MazF-mt3 and VapB-mt24 pair exhibited a clear increase in steady-state mRNA levels (ratios of ∼1.5 for each); this level was essentially the same at both NRP1 and NRP2 stages. Interestingly, this is the same pair for which we demonstrated both an in vitro and in vivo interaction (Fig. 4A). We were unable to determine whether the transcripts corresponding to the cognate TA pair MazF-mt3/MazE-mt3 were also elevated because the Rv number for MazE-mt3 was not listed in this dataset. Activation of toxins is sometimes thought to occur by a combination of the degradation of the antitoxin by a protease activated by host cell stress followed by an increase in transcription of the TA operon. This would result in a net higher concentration of toxin in the cell compared with operons whose transcription rate did not increase. In the TA field, these data implicate the TA pair showing a relative increase in steady-state transcript abundance in having a hand in toxin-mediated growth modulation. A general scheme for how TA systems are regulated has emerged from methodical studies of E. coli and bacteriophage TA systems, especially for the mazEF (6Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G.

The toxin and antitoxin form a stable protein complex; however, the antitoxin is unstable relative to the toxin protein because it is susceptible to cleavage by one of the cellular proteases. The operon is autoregulated; both the antitoxin alone and the TA complex repress transcription upon binding to the palindrome upstream of the module. Antitoxin instability and operon autoregulation are key features of this very dynamic system. When stress conditions lead to activation of cellular proteases, the levels of antitoxin decrease, leading to a concomitant decrease in the concentration of both repressors (antitoxin only and the TA complex) of transcription. Therefore, protease degradation of the antitoxin now leads to diminished levels of antitoxin but a relative increase in module transcription because the antitoxin repressors are in short supply. These tandem events result in an excess of toxin. Consequently, any free toxin will act on its target (e.g. ACA sequences in mRNA for E. coli MazF) leading to transient growth arrest or eventual cell death if antitoxin synthesis does not resume within a window of time (18Amitai S. Yassin Y. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8295-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Kolodkin-Gal I. Hazan R. Gaathon A. Carmeli S. Engelberg-Kulka H. Science. 2007; 318: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The physiological consequences of this dynamic feature of TA systems have not been studied in cells such as Mtb that contain multiple family members. As with E. coli, Mtb possesses multiple proteases (including the ClpXP protease) (31Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry 3rd, C.E.

However, its genome does not contain genes encoding an apparent lon protease or ClpA ATP-dependent subunit to associate with the ClpP proteolytic subunit (31Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry 3rd, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N.

Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6555) Google Scholar). The role of Mtb proteases in regulating toxin activity has not yet been investigated. Also, the physiological triggers of antitoxin degradation (which precedes toxin activation) are not known. Because the E. coli genome does not possess multiple toxins within a single family, as Mtb does, the general assumption in the field has been that each distinct toxin can pair with only one antitoxin. In this work, we presented data that challenges the one toxin-one antitoxin paradigm. It is not clear whether the networking of toxins and antitoxins exists in other bacteria or is unique to Mtb. The existing data suggest that the concerted action of these MazF and VapC toxins may facilitate adaptation to the environmental conditions encountered during Mtb infection. Our data serve as a foundation for future studies on these TA systems in their natural host. It will be important to gain a deeper understanding of how the concerted action of this broad spectrum of TA systems manifests in vivo with respect to Mtb growth rate regulation, latency, and pathogenicity.

Ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) has previously been implicated in endocytosis of several receptors by virtue of their deubiquitination. The present study explores an indirect role for USP8 in cargo trafficking through its regulation of the chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). Contrary to the effects of USP8 loss on enhanced green fluorescent protein, we find that USP8 depletion stabilizes CXCR4 on the cell surface and attenuates receptor degradation without affecting its ubiquitination status. In the presence of ligand, diminished CXCR4 turnover is accompanied by receptor accumulation on enlarged early endosomes and leads to enhancement of phospho-ERK signaling. Perturbation in CXCR4 trafficking, resulting from USP8 inactivation, occurs at the ESCRT-0 checkpoint, and catalytic mutation of USP8 specifically targeted to the ESCRT-0 complex impairs the spatial and temporal organization of the sorting endosome. USP8 functionally opposes the ubiquitin ligase AIP4 with respect to ESCRT-0 ubiquitination, thereby promoting trafficking of CXCR4. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a functional cooperation between USP8, AIP4, and the ESCRT-0 machinery at the early sorting phase of CXCR4 and underscore the versatility of USP8 in shaping trafficking events at the early-to-late endosome transition.

Malfunctions along the molecular pathways governing endocytosis can lead to a wide range of human pathologies including metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancer (1Hoeller D. Hecker C.M.

Although the mechanisms by which Hrs globally regulates endosomal sorting remain ambiguous, there is a clear phenotypic role for reversible ubiquitination as a signal directing ESCRT-0-mediated endocytosis. Association of ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes with the ESCRT complexes is known to mediate endocytic trafficking through reversible ubiquitination of cargo as well as the sorting machinery itself. In yeast, the ESCRT-0 complex is comprised of the Hrs and STAM orthologs, Vps27 and Hse1, respectively, and associates with the ligase Rsp5 and the DUBs Ubp2 and Ubp7 to promote sorting into the multivesicular body (16Ren J. Kee Y. Huibregtse J.M. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 324-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Despite the low sequence similarity between their protein components, the yeast and human ESCRT-0 complexes exhibit highly conserved three-dimensional structures (17Ren X. Kloer D.P. Kim Y.C.

A conditional mouse knock-out of USP8 is characterized by marked destabilization of Hrs and STAM (21Niendorf S. Oksche A. Kisser A. Löhler J. Prinz M. Schorle H. Feller S. Lewitzky M. Horak I. Knobeloch K.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5029-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, USP8 depletion results in increased ubiquitination of the early sorting proteins (22Mizuno E. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. Komada M.

These global effects of USP8 inactivation on the endocytic compartment are reminiscent of phenotypes resulting from perturbations in the function of Hrs (22Mizuno E. Kobayashi K. Yamamoto A.

Collectively, the body of literature on USP8 implicates it as a regulator of Hrs function with consequences for the stability of receptors subject to Hrs-dependent endocytosis. On this basis, cooperation between USP8 and the ESCRT-0 complex is proposed to constitute a critical regulatory mechanism in endocytosis with profound consequences for cargo trafficking at the early-to-late endosome transition. We have recently shown that USP8 associates with STAM to mediate direct deubiquitination of activated EGFR, thereby stabilizing the receptor against down-regulation by the lysosome (18Berlin I. Schwartz H. Nash P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; (August 24)10.1074/jbc.M109.016287Google Scholar). The work presented herein investigates a different role of USP8 in endocytosis through the examination of its effects on trafficking and turnover of the chemokine receptor, CXCR4. CXCR4 is a prominent member of the seven-transmembrane class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that was first identified as a co-receptor for HIV (25Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3614) Google Scholar) and has since been shown to fulfill critical roles in hematopoiesis, immune system organization, and stem cell homing (26Miller R.J. Banisadr G. Bhattacharyya B.J. J. Neuroimmunol. 2008; 198: 31-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Patrussi L. Baldari C.T. Immunol. Lett. 2008; 115: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). By virtue of its overexpression in a variety of human cancers, CXCR4 constitutes a potential chemotherapeutic target. CXCR4 mediated chemotaxis along a gradient of its cognate ligand, stromal-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α/CXCL12), and supports metastasis of cancer to the bone marrow (25Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E.

Mol. Histol. 2004; 35: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced lysosomal degradation of CXCR4 is critical for downstream signal attenuation and is mediated by the HECT family E3 ligase atrophin-interacting protein 4 (AIP4/Itch) (29Bhandari D. Robia S.L. Marchese A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1324-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Bhandari D. Trejo J. Benovic J.L. Marchese A. J. Biol.

Cui F.F. Fan G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5742-5752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CXCR4 activation has also been linked to ubiquitination of Hrs by AIP4, and its trafficking proceeds along an Hrs-dependent pathway (32Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), suggesting that alteration in the Hrs ubiquitination status may modulate CXCR4 turnover. Despite these recent insights into the reversible ubiquitination machinery implicated in CXCR4 trafficking, the potential influence of other known endocytic regulators, including USP8, has not been addressed. USP8 and AIP4 have been shown to interact (33Panner A. Crane C.A. Weng C. Feletti A. Fang S. Parsa A.T. Pieper R.O. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 5046-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and recent evidence has demonstrated cooperation between USP8 and AIP4 in reversible ubiquitination of a GPCR substrate, δ-opioid receptor (34Hislop J.N. Henry A.G. Marchese A. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19361-19370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As both enzymes impinge on Hrs ubiquitination, their opposition in this regard may regulate ESCRT-0 function and thereby control cargo transit from early to late endosomal compartments. To probe whether USP8 may indirectly promote receptor degradation through its regulation of the ESCRT-0 machinery, the present study explores the role of USP8 in CXCR4 trafficking and offers novel insights into the regulation of ubiquitin-mediated events at the sorting endosome. Contrary to the effects of USP8 inactivation on EGFR, we find that USP8 loss-of-function leads to diminished CXCR4 turnover and induces receptor accumulation on enlarged Hrs-positive early endosomes. Catalytic activity of USP8 opposes that of AIP4 in the regulation of ESCRT-0 ubiquitination status and is essential for the maintenance of sorting endosome integrity. Furthermore, inactivation of USP8 bound to the ESCRT-0 complex exhibits colocalization with high ubiquitin content on disordered endosomes marked by Hrs and perturbs the early-to-late endosomal transition, resulting in impairment of CXCR4 trafficking. Our findings therefore demonstrate functional cooperation between USP8, AIP4, and the ESCRT-0 machinery in shaping receptor progression through the sorting endosome.

Western blots were visualized with LI-COR Odyssey Infrared imager and band intensities were quantified using Odyssey 3.0 software. Final image processing was performed in Adobe Photoshop CS3 and was limited to brightness enhancement and cropping. Contrast enhancement was used only to aide visualization of endogenous USP8 bands. All reported quantification is based on the number of independent experiments specified in the corresponding figure legends, with error bars representing S.D. All graphical representations were generated using DeltaGraph 7.5.5 software. The following primary mouse monoclonal antibodies were used for Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence: anti-HA (Covance), anti-Myc (CST or Santa Cruz), anti-β-Actin, and anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-EGFR-528 (Santa Cruz), anti-TSG101 (Abcam), anti-EEA1 (BD Biosciences), and anti-CD63 and anti-LAMP1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa).

Rabbit USP8 and Hrs antisera were generated against GST fusion proteins of murine proteins as described (18Berlin I. Schwartz H. Nash P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; (August 24)10.1074/jbc.M109.016287Google Scholar). Goat secondary antibodies anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-800 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-680 were purchased from LI-COR. Goat secondary antibody Alexa Fluor conjugates for anti-rat 488, anti-rabbit 568, and anti-mouse 488/647 were purchased from Molecular Probes. For endogenous CXCR4 stability, HeLa cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 into 6-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were transfected with 100 pmol of control or anti-USP8 siRNA and 48 h following transfection lysed in 2× SDS gel loading buffer containing 200 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Samples were sonicated and subjected to Western blot analysis as indicated. Quantification of relative protein abundance was carried out relative to actin controls. For the signaling assay, cells were manipulated as above and treated with 1.25–2.5 nm SDF-1α (PeproTech) for 10 min or 1 h, washed with ice-cold PBS, and samples were prepared as above. Signaling was assayed by Western blot against phospho-ERK1/2 and quantified relative to unphosphorylated ERK1/2 control. For turnover of transiently overexpressed HA-CXCR4 using siRNA, HeLa cells were seeded at 1.425 × 106 per 100-mm dish and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were co-transfected with 1.5 µg of HA-CXCR4 and 600 pmol of siRNA. 24 h following transfection, cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 0.85 × 106 per well and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were treated with 25 nm SDF-1α in the presence of 20–40 µg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma) for the indicated duration of time. Samples were prepared as described above and CXCR4 abundance was monitored by Western blot against HA. Quantification of relative HA-CXCR4 abundance was carried out relative to actin controls. For HA-CXCR4 degradation using overexpression of USP8 or mutants, HEK293 cells were seeded at 2 × 106/100-mm dish and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were co-transfected with 1.5 µg of HA-CXCR4 and 7.5 µg of USP8 or mutant. 24 h following transfection, cells were seeded into 24-well plates, allowed to adhere overnight, and treated with 10 nm SDF-1α in the presence of cycloheximide for the indicated duration of time. Samples were prepared and analyzed as described above. For examination of surface CXCR4, HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with HA-CXCR4 and relevant siRNA oligonucleotides in 100-mm plates as indicated above, and biotinylation of membrane proteins under steady-state growth conditions was performed as previously described (20Sierra M.I. Wright M.H. Nash P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13990-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CXCR4 ubiquitination was assayed using single-tag FLAG-ubiquitin according to a published protocol (36Marchese A. Methods Enzymol. 2009; 460: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and EGFR as well as the Hrs ubiquitination methods have been previously described (18Berlin I. Schwartz H. Nash P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; (August 24)10.1074/jbc.M109.016287Google Scholar). Receptor ubiquitination was quantified relative to total immunoprecipitated receptor control. For knockdown studies, HeLa cells transfected with HA-CXCR4 and siRNA, as described above, were seeded at 5 × 105 per well onto polylysine-coated glass coverslips (Corning) in 6-well tissue culture plates 24 h post-transfection and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were treated with 25 nm SDF-1α for 5 h, fixed, and immunostained as described below. For USP8 overexpression studies with HA-CXCR4, cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 per well onto coverslips and co-transfected with 0.25 µg of HA-CXCR4 and 1.25 µg of vector control, FLAG-USP8, or FLAG-C748A for 24 h. Following transfection, cells were fixed and immunostained as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated (see below), cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10–15 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10–15 min. All immunostaining, except for anti-CD63, was performed in 5% milk in PBS according to standard protocols. For immunostaining with anti-CD63, cells were also fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, however, permeabilization and antibody incubations were carried out in 3% BSA/PBS containing 0.05% saponin. For colocalization of CXCR4 with STAM1, cells were fixed and permeabilized in a 1:1 methanol/acetone solution for 20 min at −20 °C. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Gold antifade mounting media with DAPI (Invitrogen). All samples were imaged on a Leica SP5-2 photon confocal microscope using ×100 oil objective with ×3 digital zoom. Images were collected and analyzed with LASAF software and final processing was performed using ImageJ64. Quantification of CXCR4-positive endosome size using immunofluorescence was performed using 3 independent data sets, with 5–10 images per condition analyzed for each experiment. To enable direct comparison, all images within a given experiment were taken under the same magnification and laser intensity settings. For every cell analyzed, the area for 5–10 representative CXCR4-positive endosomes was quantified using ImageJ64 and average endosome size was expressed relative to that of the siControl samples. Colocalization was quantified using the JACoP plug-in for ImageJ64, with 5–10 representative cells per condition collected from at least 2 independent experiments. Background corrections were specified manually in ImageJ64 prior to running JACoP analysis, with similar adjustments applied across all images per channel per experiment. For colocalization reported as a fraction of channel “A” overlapping channel “B” (labeled A:B), overlap was quantified using Mander's coefficients calculated on the basis of automated threshold settings, with 0 and 1 corresponding to no colocalization and complete colocalization, respectively. For colocalization reported in the form of a coefficient (r), overlap was quantified using JACoP coefficients k1 and k2, where r2 = k1 × k2. BiFC was used in combination with conventional immunofluorescence microscopy as previously described (18Berlin I. Schwartz H. Nash P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; (August 24)10.1074/jbc.M109.016287Google Scholar). For relevant fixation and immunostaining methods, as well as data analysis and representation of results, see above. To examine the role of USP8 in the regulation of CXCR4 stability, effects of transient USP8 ablation by short interfering RNA (siRNA) on receptor abundance were assessed. Efficient depletion of USP8 (80% decrease in USP8 protein levels) resulted in nearly a 2-fold increase in endogenous CXCR4 protein (Fig. 1, A and B). By contrast, EGFR was drastically destabilized in the same cells. This is consistent with published evidence (18Berlin I. Schwartz H. Nash P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; (August 24)10.1074/jbc.M109.016287Google Scholar, 21Niendorf S. Oksche A. Kisser A. Löhler J. Prinz M. Schorle H. Feller S. Lewitzky M. Horak I. Knobeloch K.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5029-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and indicates that USP8 may function to exert opposing consequences on the stability of different cell surface receptors. Steady-state accumulation of CXCR4 observed in the absence of USP8 suggests a role for USP8 in CXCR4 turnover. In the presence of activating ligand, SDF-1α (SDF1), CXCR4 is known to undergo endocytosis and ubiquitin-mediated degradation (29Bhandari D. Robia S.L. Marchese A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 1324-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Bhandari D. Trejo J. Benovic J.L. Marchese A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36971-36979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 31Mines M.A. Goodwin J.S. Limbird L.E. Cui F.F. Fan G.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of USP8 depletion on the rate of ligand-dependent CXCR4 degradation was assessed. Cells transiently overexpressing HA-tagged CXCR4 (HA-CXCR4) and either control or anti-USP8 siRNA were treated with SDF1 in the presence of cycloheximide (used to block de novo protein synthesis) for the indicated duration of time and HA-CXCR4 abundance was monitored by Western blot (Fig. 1C). At 5 h following the addition of SDF1, more than half of the total CXCR4 was down-regulated in the control cells, whereas cells compromised for USP8 degraded only 30% of the starting CXCR4 material (Fig. 1D). Stabilization of CXCR4 against ligand-induced turnover was similarly observed using an alternate siRNA targeting USP8 in the same cells (supplemental Fig. S1A). The diminished rate of receptor degradation in the presence of SDF1 therefore indicated a requirement for USP8 in the establishment of ligand-mediated CXCR4 turnover. To determine whether additional CXCR4 found in cells depleted of USP8 resides at the plasma membrane or is intracellular and thereby sequestered from the interaction with ligand, we examined CXCR4 surface levels as a function of USP8. In this assay, cells were surface modified with biotin and biotinylated proteins were isolated using neutravidin precipitation, followed by immunoblot against HA-CXCR4 (Fig. 2A). Comparison of protein levels in the surface fraction with the whole cell lysates revealed that in the absence of USP8, the change in total cellular CXCR4 was matched by a proportional accumulation of surface receptor (Fig. 2B). These findings demonstrate that the majority of additional CXCR4 material found in cells depleted of USP8 is available for ligand engagement at the plasma membrane. Global changes in cellular receptor levels may impact ligand-mediated events downstream. Specifically, increase in surface CXCR4 abundance may give rise to enhanced and/or prolonged signaling in response to SDF1. Indeed, in cells expressing endogenous CXCR4, loss of USP8 resulted in increased phospho-ERK signaling following stimulation with SDF1 (Fig. 2C). The initial activation response (10 min) was 35% higher in USP8 knockdown cells compared with the control and sustained signaling (1 h) increased by nearly 2.5-fold as a result of USP8 depletion (Fig. 2D). These changes in SDF1-induced phospho-ERK activation imply that USP8-dependent control of CXCR4 abundance and turnover directly affects signaling. Importantly, consistent with opposing effects of USP8 depletion on cell"

We investigated whether connexon 43 (Cx43)-mediated cell adhesion modulates self-assembly of human KGN granulosa cells, normal human fibroblasts (NHFs), and MCF-7 breast cancer cells seeded into nonadhesive agarose gels. We found that treatment with anti-Cx43 E2 (112 μg/ml), which suppresses Cx43 docking, significantly inhibited the kinetics of KGN and NHF self-assembly compared to the preimmune sera control (41.1 ± 4.5 and 24.5 ± 10.4% at 8 h, respectively). Likewise, gap junction inhibitor carbenoxolone also inhibited self-assembly of KGN, NHF, and MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner that was specific to cell type. In contrast, Gap26 connexin mimetic peptide, which inhibits channel permeability but not docking, accelerated self-assembly of KGN and NHF microtissues. Experiments using selective enzymatic digestion of cell adhesion molecules and neutralizing N-cadherin antibodies further showed that self-assembly was comparably disrupted by inhibiting connexin- and cadherin-mediated adhesion. These findings demonstrate that connexon-mediated cell adhesion and intercellular communication differentially influence microtissue self-assembly, and that their contributions are comparable to those of cadherins."

Little, however, is known concerning its role in the vascular endothelium, a major regulator of blood pressure. Here, we show that NAADP acetoxymethyl ester (NAADP-AM), a cell-permeant NAADP analog, increases cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration in aortic endothelial cells. We demonstrate that these signals and those evoked by acetylcholine are blocked by disrupting acidic organelles with bafilomycin A1. In contrast, Ca(2+) signals in response to thrombin are only partially inhibited by bafilomycin A1 treatment, and those to ATP were insensitive, suggesting that recruitment of acidic stores is agonist-specific. We further show that NAADP-evoked Ca(2+) signals hyperpolarize endothelial cells and generate NO. Additionally, we demonstrate that NAADP dilates aortic rings in an endothelium- and NO-dependent manner. Finally, we show that intravenous administration of NAADP-AM into anesthetized rats decreases mean arterial pressure. Our data extend the actions of NAADP to the endothelium both in vitro and in vivo, pointing to a previously unrecognized role for this messenger in controlling blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W1981919253,"Mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow into peripheral blood by the cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has become the preferred source of HSPCs for stem cell transplants. However, G-CSF fails to mobilize sufficient numbers of stem cells in up to 10% of donors, precluding autologous transplantation in those donors or substantially delaying transplant recovery time. Consequently, new regimens are needed to increase the number of stem cells in peripheral blood upon mobilization. Using a forward genetic approach in mice, we mapped the gene encoding the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) to a genetic region modifying G-CSF-mediated HSPC mobilization. Amounts of EGFR in HSPCs inversely correlated with the cells' ability to be mobilized by G-CSF, implying a negative role for EGFR signaling in mobilization. In combination with G-CSF treatment, genetic reduction of EGFR activity in HSPCs (in waved-2 mutant mice) or treatment with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib increased mobilization. Increased mobilization due to suppression of EGFR activity correlated with reduced activity of cell division control protein-42 (Cdc42), and genetic Cdc42 deficiency in vivo also enhanced G-CSF-induced mobilization. Our findings reveal a previously unknown signaling pathway regulating stem cell mobilization and provide a new pharmacological approach for improving HSPC mobilization and thereby transplantation outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2000023267,"ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17, also referred to as TNFα converting enzyme or TACE) is a cell-surface metalloproteinase that regulates signaling via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and has important roles in diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. ADAM17 can be activated by stimulation of several tyrosine kinase receptors, raising questions about whether oncogenic tyrosine kinases could also enhance EGFR signaling and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) via stimulation of ADAM17. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the role of Src in activating ADAM17. We provide evidence that a constitutively active transforming form of Src, the E378G mutant, as well as v-Src enhance ADAM17-mediated shedding of the EGFR ligand TGFα. Moreover, we demonstrate that constitutive shedding of TGFα can be reduced by inhibition of Src in several cell lines, including COS7, MCF7 (the human breast cancer cell line), PAE (a pig aortic endothelial cell line) and HaCaT (the human keratinocyte cell line) cells. Src(E378G)-stimulated shedding of TGFα is abolished in Adam17−/− cells, but can be rescued by wild-type (wt) ADAM17 and a mutant ADAM17 lacking its cytoplasmic domain. These findings demonstrate that ADAM17 is the principal TGFα sheddase that is activated by Src in a manner that does not require the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17. Finally, we show that stimulation of ADAM17 by Src(E378G) leads to enhanced paracrine signaling via release of EGFR ligands into the culture supernatant. These results raise the possibility that activation of ADAM17 by oncogenic forms of Src can aid in promoting tumorigenesis by enhancing signaling via the EGFR and ERK in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Enhanced autocrine signaling could further activate tumor cells expressing oncogenic mutants of Src, whereas paracrine signaling could stimulate EGFR and ERK signaling in surrounding non-transformed cells such as stromal cells, thereby contributing to crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059698904,"p21(Waf1/Cip1) is a p53 transcription target implicated in both major functions of the tumor suppressor--cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It is a potent inhibitor of the key cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK1-4), and has been thought to be the main mediator of p53-dependent G1 and G2 arrest. However, an increasing body of information suggests that in addition to its cell-cycle inhibitory activity, p21 can affect p53-dependent apoptosis. These data have been obtained from experiments in which p53 is activated primarily by genotoxic stress. In this study, we use the selective MDM2 antagonist, nutlin-3a, as a nongenotoxic p53 activator and show that the cell-cycle arrest function of p21 is dependent on the cellular context. In most cancer cell lines, p53-dependent p21 induction is essential for cell-cycle arrest, but in some, p21 is dispensable. Depletion of p21 did not increase the apoptotic response to nutlin-3a in all seven cancer cell lines tested and p21 overexpression did not protect apoptosis-sensitive lines from death. p21 was found to mediate nutlin-induced p53-dependent downregulation of another antiapoptotic protein, survivin, without significantly affecting the apoptotic outcome. Taken together our results suggest that p21 induction does not affect the apoptotic response to nongenotoxic p53 activation."

Previously, we discovered that preinsertion of short-chain sphingolipids such as AŁoctanoyl-glucosylceramide (GC) in the tumor cell membrane enhances cellular Dox uptake. In the present study, we apply this strategy in vitro and in vivo by coadministering GC and Dox in a lipid nanovesicle (LNV). GC enrichment of Dox-LNVs strongly enhanced in vitro cyto-toxicity toward B16 melanoma and A431 carcinoma, as evidenced by 6-fold decreased IC50 values compared with Dox-LNVs. This correlated with enhanced cellular Dox uptake observed by confocal microscopy. Intravital optical imaging in window chamber-bearing mice with ortho-topically implanted B16 melanoma demonstrated enhanced GC-mediated Dox delivery to tumor cells. Treatment of nude mice bearing human A431 xenografts with 6 mg/kg GC-Dox-LNVs almost doubled the tumor growth delay compared with Dox-LNVs. A second administration of 5 mg/kg after 3 d induced even 3-fold delay in tumor growth, while no systemic toxicity was found. GC-enriched Dox-LNVs displayed superior in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity, without systemic toxicity. This new drug delivery concept, aiming at increased membrane permeability for amphiphilic drugs, provides an opportunity to improve cancer chemotherapy.—Van Lummel, M., van Blitterswijk, W.

https://openalex.org/W2080167853,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a homeostatic signaling mechanism that balances the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the secretory protein load of the cell. ER protein folding capacity is dependent on the abundance of chaperones, which is increased in response to UPR signaling, and on a sufficient ATP supply for their activity. An essential branch of the UPR entails the splicing of XBP1 mRNA to form the XBP1 transcription factor. XBP1 has been shown to be required during adipocyte differentiation, enabling mature adipocytes to secrete adiponectin, and during differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Here we find that adenylate kinase 2 (AK2), a mitochondrial enzyme that regulates adenine nucleotide interconversion within the intermembrane space, is markedly induced during adipocyte and B cell differentiation. Depletion of AK2 by RNAi impairs adiponectin secretion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, IgM secretion in BCL1 cells, and the induction of the UPR during differentiation of both cell types. These results reveal a new mechanism by which mitochondria support ER function and suggest that specific mitochondrial defects may give rise to impaired UPR signaling. The requirement for AK2 for UPR induction may explain the pathogenesis of the profound hematopoietic defects of reticular dysgenesis, a disease associated with mutations of the AK2 gene in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2065454219,"Although human skin fibroblast (HSF) elastase has been characterized as a membrane-bound metalloproteinase, little is known about its structure, amino acid sequence, and encoding gene. As there are similarities in the molecular weights and inhibitory profiles of HSF elastase and neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP)), in this study we tested the hypothesis that they are identical using immunoprecipitation and transfection methods. An immunoprecipitation study demonstrated that HSF elastase activity co-immunoprecipitated with anti-NEP in lysates of cultured HSF. Transfection of an NEP cDNA expression vector into COS-1 cells elicited the expression of HSF elastase and NEP activities in the transfected cells. These findings strongly suggest that HSF elastase is identical to NEP, which functions mainly in neuron-associated cells to degrade neuropeptides. Analysis of the expression pattern of NEP revealed that its expression was remarkably up-regulated at the gene, protein, and enzymatic activity levels during the replicative senescence of cultured HSF. Further, the activity of NEP was markedly enhanced in a pattern similar to elastase activity during the intrinsic aging of mouse skin, in UVA-exposed HSF as well as in HSF treated with conditioned medium from UVB-exposed human keratinocytes. Analysis of the cytokine profile for the stimulation of NEP and HSF elastase activities in HSF demonstrated that among the 11 cytokines tested, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF had the potential to significantly stimulate both activities similarly, again supporting the identity of HSF elastase and NEP."

We used transient kinetics to characterize the enzymatic properties of N348I RT and determine the biochemical mechanism of resistance to the NNRTI nevirapine (NVP). We demonstrate that changes distant from the NNRTI binding pocket decrease inhibitor binding (increase Kd-NVP) by primarily decreasing the association rate of the inhibitor (kon-NVP). We characterized RTs mutated in either p66 (p66N348I/p51WT), p51 (p66WT/p51N348I), or both subunits (p66N348I/p51N348I). Mutation in either subunit caused NVP resistance during RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerization. Mutation in p66 alone (p66N348I/p51WT) caused NVP resistance without significantly affecting RNase H activity, whereas mutation in p51 caused NVP resistance and impaired RNase H, demonstrating that NVP resistance may occur independently from defects in RNase H function. Mutation in either subunit improved affinity for nucleic acid and enhanced processivity of DNA synthesis. Surprisingly, mutation in either subunit decreased catalytic rates (kpol) of p66N348I/p51N348I, p66N348I/p51WT, and p66WT/p51N348I without significantly affecting affinity for deoxynucleotide substrate (Kd-dNTP). Hence, in addition to providing structural integrity for the heterodimer, p51 is critical for fine tuning catalytic turnover, RNase H processing, and drug resistance.

In conclusion, connection subdomain mutation N348I decreases catalytic efficiency and causes in vitro resistance to NVP by decreasing inhibitor binding. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) converts the viral single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome to a double-stranded DNA, which is integrated into the host genome. To achieve this task, RT possesses multiple enzymatic activities, including both DNA-dependent and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities and RNase H activity. RT is a heterodimer composed of 66-kDa (p66) and 51-kDa (p51) subunits. p66 is 560 amino acids long and comprises the spatially distinct polymerase and RNase H domains. The polymerase domain of p66 includes the fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains that resemble a clasping right hand connected to the RNase H domain through the connection subdomain. p51 contains the first 440 amino acids of p66 and is derived by HIV-1 protease-mediated cleavage of an RNase H domain from the p66/p66 homodimer. Because p51 of the heterodimer has no enzymatic function, it has been proposed that its role is simply to provide structural support to p66. HIV-1 RT has been a prominent target of anti-AIDS therapies. There are two classes of approved drugs that target RT: the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) 3The abbreviations used are: NRTInucleoside RT inhibitorNNRTInon-nucleoside RT inhibitorNVPnevirapineNNIBPNNRTI binding pocketAZTazidothymidineCSMconnection subdomain mutation. and the non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs). NRTIs mimic deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) substrates required for DNA synthesis. Once integrated into the nascent viral DNA, NRTIs act as chain terminators because they lack a 3′-OH group required for formation of a phosphodiester bond with the incoming nucleotide (1De Clercq E. J. Clin. Virol. 2004; 30: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 2Parniak M.A. Sluis-Cremer N. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 49: 67-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). On the other hand, NNRTIs are non-competitive RT inhibitors with respect to either dNTP or nucleic acid substrates and have been proposed to interfere with the chemical step of DNA synthesis by altering the precise geometry of the polymerase active site and by restricting the mobility of the p66 thumb (3Ren J.

NNRTIs bind at the NNRTI binding pocket (NNIBP), a hydrophobic pocket at the base of the p66 thumb and close (∼10 Å) to the polymerase active site, formed primarily by residues from p66 and Glu-138 from p51. NNRTI binding results in conformational changes that shift the “primer grip” and overextend the p66 thumb (10Tantillo C. Ding J. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Pauwels R.

Until recently, almost all clinically relevant NRTI and NNRTI resistance mutations were found at the p66 fingers and palm subdomains.

Yap et al. (31Yap S.H. Sheen C.W. Fahey J. Zanin M. Tyssen D. Lima V.D. Wynhoven B. Kuiper M. Sluis-Cremer N. Harrigan P.R. Tachedjian G.

Specifically, addition of the CSMs N348I and A360V to the AZT-resistant M41L/D67N/T215Y RT enhanced AZT resistance by causing preservation of AZT-terminated RNA/DNA that can be unblocked by RT with CSMs (39Ehteshami M.

The mechanism by which CSMs confer resistance to NNRTIs is largely unknown. Moreover, the effect of N348I on the biochemical aspects of DNA synthesis is also not well understood. Here we resolved the mechanism of NVP resistance using pre-steady state kinetics analysis to quantify NVP binding and dissociation from wild-type (WT) and N348I enzymes. We also determined how Ile-348 in p66 (Ile-348p66) or p51 (Ile-348p51) affects other enzymatic properties of RT relevant to drug resistance, including the efficiency of DNA polymerization, RNase H activity, processivity of DNA synthesis, and affinity for various substrates. We prepared subunit-specific RT mutants by expressing the two subunits from a single plasmid, allowing in situ folding and yielding proteins of superior quality compared with those obtained from reconstitution of separately expressed RT subunits. In our experience, this method of RT expression is a critical factor for optimizing transient kinetics and crystallographic data. The p66 and p51 sequences of RT (BH-10) were cloned in the pETDuet-1 vector (Novagen) using restriction sites PpumI and SacI for p51 and SacII and AvrII for p66. To produce mutant RT, sequences coding for p66 and p51 were independently subcloned and mutated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) before being sequentially cloned into a pETDuet-1 vector. Sequences coding for a hexahistidine tag and the 3C protease recognition sequence were added at the N terminus of p51. RT enzymes were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography and mono Q anion exchange chromatography as described previously (40Michailidis E.

For the NVP susceptibility assays, a 100-base-long template (T100; described in Ref. 40Michailidis E. Marchand B. Kodama E.N. Singh K. Matsuoka M. Kirby K.A. Ryan E.M. Sawani A.M. Nagy E. Ashida N.

For the RNase H assays, a 22-base pair duplex (Cy3-Tr35/Pd22) consisting of a 5′ Cy3-labeled RNA template (Cy3-Tr35) of the sequence 5′-Cy3-GGAAAUCUCUAGCAGUGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACCU-3′ annealed to a DNA primer (Pd22) of the sequence 5′-AGGTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCACT-3′ was used (39Ehteshami M. Beilhartz G.L. Scarth B.J. Tchesnokov E.P. McCormick S. Wynhoven B. Harrigan P.R. Götte M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22222-22232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Primers were annealed to templates at concentrations corresponding to a 1:3 molar ratio. Deoxynucleotide triphosphates and dideoxynucleotide triphosphates were purchased from Fermentas (Glen Burnie, MD). The concentrations of nucleotides and nucleic acids were calculated spectrophotometrically based on absorption at 260 nm. We determined the active site concentrations of RT preparations using pre-steady state burst experiments. We preincubated a fixed concentration of RT (40 nm; determined by absorbance measurements) in RT buffer (50 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) with increasing concentrations of Td31/Cy3-Pd18 followed by rapidly mixing with a solution of MgCl2 (5 mm) and dATP (50 μm) in RT buffer (41Spence R.A. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using an RQF-3 rapid quench-flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) (all values are final concentrations). Reaction mixtures were then incubated at 37 °C for times spanning 0.005–5 s before quenching with EDTA (50 mm). Reaction products were resolved under denaturing conditions in polyacrylamide-urea DNA gels and quantitated by phosphorimaging and densitometry using Multi Gauge V3.0 (FujiFilm). First the amounts of extended primer (P) were plotted against time with GraphPad Prism 4, and the data were fit to the following biphasic equation,P=A(1-e-kobst)+ksst(Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude of the burst phase that represents the enzyme-DNA complex at the start of the reaction, kobs is the observed burst rate constant for dNTP incorporation, kss corresponds to the steady state rate constant, and t is the reaction time. Next, the active site concentration and template/primer dissociation constant (Kd-DNA) were determined by plotting the amplitude (A) against template/primer concentration. The data were fit by non-linear regression to a quadratic equation,A=0.5((Kd-DNA+[RT]+[DNA]-0.25(Kd-DNA+[RT]+[DNA])2-([RT](DNA)))(Eq. 2) where [RT] is the concentration of actively binding polymerase molecules. Subsequent transient state biochemical experiments were performed using corrected active site concentrations. The optimal polymerase rates were obtained by pre-steady state kinetics analysis using single nucleotide incorporation assays. A solution containing RT (30 nm), Td31/Cy3-Pd18 (30 nm), and EDTA (0.5 mm) in RT buffer was mixed with a solution of MgCl2 (5 mm) and dATP (0.5–75 μm) for reaction times ranging between 0.005 and 5 s before quenching with EDTA (50 mm). Reaction products were resolved and quantitated as described above. Burst phase incorporation rates and substrate affinities at individual dATP concentrations were obtained from fitting the data to the burst equation (Equation 1). To determine optimal rates of dNTP incorporation (kpol) and dNTP binding to the enzyme-DNA complex (Kd-dATP), observed burst rates (kobs) were fit to the following hyperbolic equation.kobs=(kpol[dNTP])/(Kd-dNTP+[dNTP])(Eq. 3) Processivity assays were conducted under single turnover conditions as described by Patel et al. (42Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Solutions containing Td31/Cy3-Pd18 (20 nm), WT (40 nm) or mutant enzyme (60 nm p66N348I/p51N348I), and EDTA (0.5 mm) in RT buffer were mixed with solutions containing dNTPs (50 μm) and MgCl2 (5 mm) for varying times (0.05–5 s) before quenching with EDTA (50 mm). Reaction products were resolved and quantitated as described above. To obtain the rate of Pd18 extension, results were plotted using a one-phase exponential decay equation,P=A0(e-kappt)+C(Eq. 4) where kapp is the apparent rate of product (P) formation, A0 is the amplitude, t is time, and C is a constant. The rates of nucleotide incorporation at individual positions along the template were obtained by fitting data to a double exponential equation,P=A(1-e-k1t)+(e-k2t)+C(Eq. 5) where A is the concentration of 19-mer or higher length products, k1 is the rate of product generation, k2 is the rate of subsequent product elongation, and C is a constant. RNase H assays were performed by incubating RNA/DNA duplex Cy3-Tr35/Pd22 (100 nm) with RT (200 nm) in RT buffer at 37 °C with MgCl2 (6 mm). Reactions were quenched after incubation (1–8 min) with equal volumes of 99% formamide containing trace amounts of bromphenol blue. Reaction products were resolved in denaturing polyacrylamide-urea DNA gels and quantitated as described above. The primary RNase H cleavage product is mainly 18 nucleotides from the 3′-end of the DNA primer (−18 nucleotides), and the secondary cleavage product is mainly 12 nucleotides from the 3′-end of the primer (−12 nucleotides) as reported previously (39Ehteshami M. Beilhartz G.L. Scarth B.J. Tchesnokov E.P. McCormick S. Wynhoven B. Harrigan P.R. Götte M. J. Biol.

Drug susceptibility steady state assays were carried out by measuring the extension of Td100/Pd18 in the presence of increasing concentrations of NVP. Reactions of 50 μl containing RT (2 nm), MgCl2 (5 mm), Td100/Pd18 (10 nm), and dNTPs (0.8 μm of each with 0.5 μCi/nmol α-32P-labeled dTTP) in RT buffer were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (6 mm), incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and terminated by the addition of EDTA (50 mm). Reaction products were then passed through a charged nylon filter using a vacuum manifold apparatus (Whatman, GE Healthcare). Extended primers, radiolabeled by the incorporation of [32P]dTMP, bound to the membrane, whereas the unincorporated [α-32P]dTTP was filtered through. Radioactive filters were exposed to phosphor screens followed by phosphorimaging and analysis using the Multi Gauge V3.0 software (FujiFilm). Dose-response curves of triplicate samples were plotted using GraphPad Prism 4 to determine IC50 values for NVP. Gel-based NVP susceptibility assays were performed using Td31/Cy3-Pd18 or Tr31/Cy3-Pd18 (RNA template of corresponding sequence). RT (20 nm) was preincubated with increasing concentrations of NVP in RT buffer for 5 min at 37 °C before the addition of template/primer (60 nm), dNTPs (1 μm), and MgCl2 (5 mm). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 5 min at 37 °C before being quenched with EDTA (50 mm). Reaction products were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide-urea DNA gels, and fluorescent bands corresponding to full-extension products were quantified as described above. IC50 values were derived from dose-response curves using GraphPad Prism 4. Solutions of RT (30 nm active sites), Td31/Cy3-Pd18 (30 nm), and EDTA (5 mm) in RT buffer were incubated with various concentrations of NVP for 10 min at room temperature before initiating reactions with MgCl2 (0.5 mm) and saturating dATP (100 μm). Reactions were allowed to proceed for times between 0.005 and 5 s before quenching with EDTA (50 mm). Reaction products were fit to the burst equation (Equation 1) to calculate burst amplitudes (A) for each data set. Burst amplitudes were then fit to the following hyperbolic equation (44Wang L.Z. Kenyon G.L. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38424-38432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to determine the dissociation constant for NVP (Kd-NVP),A=[RT]-([RT][I]Kd-NVP+[I])+C(Eq. 6) where [RT] is the concentration of actively binding polymerase molecules, [I] is the concentration of inhibitor, and C is a constant. The apparent rate of NVP binding to RT (kapp-NVP) was obtained by premixing a solution of RT (30 nm) and Td31/Cy3-Pd18 (30 nm) in RT buffer with saturating NVP (40 μm) for increasing amounts of time (0.2–5 s). Reactions were then initiated by addition of MgCl2 (5 mm) and saturating dATP (50 μm), allowed to proceed for 0.2 s, and quenched with EDTA (250 mm). Reaction products were resolved and quantitated as described above and plotted with GraphPad Prism 4 using an equation for one-phase exponential decay,P=A0(e-kapp-NVPt)+C(Eq. 7) where P is the reaction product, A0 is the amount of product in the absence of NVP, t is the preincubation time with NVP before addition of MgCl2/dATP, and C is a constant. The kapp-NVP values obtained were next inserted into the following equation to derive the NVP association constant (kon-NVP) (8Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar).kapp-NVP=kon-NVP([NVP]+Kd-NVP)(Eq. 8) The kon-NVP and Kd-NVP values were then used to calculate the NVP"
https://openalex.org/W2079775295,"The low affinity receptor for IgE, CD23, is the natural regulator of IgE synthesis, and understanding both the synthesis and the catabolism of CD23 are, thus, important issues. Membrane CD23 is cleaved by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) and this cleavage influences the ability of CD23 to regulate IgE. In contrast to the belief that cleavage is a cell surface event, endosomal neutralization with NH(4)Cl was found to dramatically reduce CD23 cleavage, suggesting that the majority of CD23 cleavage occurred subsequent to internalization in the endosomal pathway and not at the cell surface. In line with this, full-length CD23 was shown to be sorted in an ADAM10-dependent manner into exosomes. Greatly increased ADAM10-mediated CD23 cleavage was seen at endosomal pH. Additionally, the stalk region of CD23 was found to interact with ADAM10 and ADAM10 binding of CD23 was found to be protease independent. SPR analysis of the interaction indicated about a 10-fold increase in the R(max) at endosomal pH (pH 5.8) compared with pH 7.4, whereas the affinity of the interaction was not significantly changed. The R(max) change, combined with the increased cleavage at endosomal pH, indicates greater accessibility of the CD23 stalk region for ADAM10 at the lower pH. These results indicate a model where CD23 internalization results in ADAM10-dependent incorporation into exosomes, followed by partial cleavage of CD23 by ADAM10 prior to being released from the cell. The increased cleavage at endosomal pH also has implications for other ADAM10 substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2018949458,"Our objective was to contrast the effect of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I mimetic peptides, such as 4F and 4F-Pro-4F (Pro), on nascent and mature atherosclerotic lesions and on levels of antibodies against oxidation-specific epitopes. Chow-fed apoE(-/-) mice were injected intraperitoneally with either the 4F peptide or a tandem helix apoA-I mimetic peptide (Pro) every other day. Mice treated with 4F, but not Pro, for 4 wk starting at 10 wk of age showed a dramatic decrease in atherosclerosis at 2 arterial sites. However, neither peptide was effective in mice treated for 8 wk starting at 20 wk of age; lesions were larger and more mature at this time point. Peptide treatment caused increased production of antibodies against oxidation-specific epitopes, including a disproportionate induction of the IgM natural antibody (NAb) E06/T15 to oxidized phospholipids. In summary, 4F, but not the tandem peptide Pro, effectively inhibited early atherogenesis but was ineffective against more mature lesions. Two different apoA-I mimetic peptides increased titers of natural antibodies against oxidation-specific epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2126355431,"The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) inhibits both cell division and apoptosis, but the mechanism by which Rb alternatively regulates these divergent outcomes remains poorly understood. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) promote cell division by phosphorylating and reversibly inactivating Rb by a hierarchical series of phosphorylation events and sequential conformational changes. The stress-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 also phosphorylates Rb, but it does so in a cell cycle-independent manner that is associated with apoptosis rather than with cell division. Here, we show that p38 phosphorylates Rb by a novel mechanism that is distinct from that of Cdks. p38 bypasses the cell cycle-associated hierarchical phosphorylation and directly phosphorylates Rb on Ser567, which is not phosphorylated during the normal cell cycle. Phosphorylation by p38, but not Cdks, triggers an interaction between Rb and the human homolog of murine double minute 2 (Hdm2), leading to degradation of Rb, release of E2F1 and cell death. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation as to how Rb regulates cell division and apoptosis through different kinases, and reveal how Hdm2 may functionally link the tumor suppressors Rb and p53."
https://openalex.org/W1982204079,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is an important intracellular protein that inhibits cytokine signaling in numerous cell types and has been implicated in several inflammatory diseases. However, the expression and function of SOCS3 in osteoblasts are not known. In this study, we demonstrated that SOCS3 expression was transiently induced by LPS in osteoblasts, and apparently contributed to the inhibition of IL-6 induction by LPS treatment. We found that tyrosine 204 of the SOCS box, the SH2 domain, and the N-terminal kinase inhibitory region (KIR) of SOCS3 were all involved in its IL-6 inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β was activated by LPS (increased DNA binding activity), and played a key role in LPS-induced IL-6 expression in osteoblasts. We further provided the evidence that SOCS3 functioned as a negative regulator for LPS response in osteoblasts by suppressing C/EBPβ DNA binding activity. In addition, tyrosine 204 of the SOCS box, the SH2 domain, and the N-terminal kinase inhibitory region (KIR) of SOCS3 were all required for its C/EBPβ inhibition. These findings suggest that SOCS3 by interfering with C/EBPβ activation may have an important regulatory role during bone-associated inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2029745919,"YchF is a subfamily of the Obg family in the TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases. The wide distribution of YchF homologues in both eukarya and bacteria suggests that they are descendents of an ancient protein, yet their physiological roles remain unclear. Using the OsYchF1-OsGAP1 pair from rice as the prototype, we provide evidence for the regulation of GTPase/ATPase activities and RNA binding capacity of a plant YchF (OsYchF1) by its regulatory protein (OsGAP1). The effects of OsGAP1 on the subcellular localization/cycling and physiological functions of OsYchF1 are also discussed. The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants. This work suggests that during evolution, an ancestral P-loop GTPase/ATPase may acquire new regulation and function(s) by the evolution of a lineage-specific regulatory protein."
https://openalex.org/W1971581969,"The heptapeptide-nucleotide microcin C (McC) is a potent inhibitor of enteric bacteria growth. Inside a sensitive cell, McC is processed by aminopeptidases, which release a nonhydrolyzable aspartyl-adenylate, a strong inhibitor of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. The mccABCDE operon is sufficient for McC production and resistance of the producing cell to McC. An additional gene, mccF, which is adjacent to but not part of the mccABCDE operon, also provides resistance to exogenous McC. MccF is similar to Escherichia coli LdcA, an L,D-carboxypeptidase whose substrate is monomeric murotetrapeptide L-Ala-D-Glu-meso-A(2)pm-D-Ala or its UDP-activated murein precursor. The mechanism by which MccF provides McC resistance remained unknown. Here, we show that MccF detoxifies both intact and processed McC by cleaving an amide bond between the C-terminal aspartate and the nucleotide moiety. MccF also cleaves the same bond in nonhydrolyzable aminoacyl sulfamoyl adenosines containing aspartyl, glutamyl, and, to a lesser extent, seryl aminoacyl moieties but is ineffective against other aminoacyl adenylates."

Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006: 317-343Google Scholar). Initial damage recognition in yeast is carried out by the Rad4-Rad23 heterodimer (orthologous to the human XPC-HR23B complex). Rad4 functions as the damage sensor protein in the heterodimer (3Min J.H. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2007; 449: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and the process of NER is highly dependent upon its availability in cells (4Ortolan T.G. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Madura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Though Rad23 alone does not bind to damaged DNA (5Xie Z. Liu S. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5981-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), rad23Δ cells are hypersensitive to UV radiation and show marked reduction in repair of UV-induced lesions (6Mueller J.P. Smerdon M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The contribution of Rad23 to NER appears to be, in part, inhibiting degradation of Rad4 (or XPC) by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP), as a defect in Rad23 leads to reduced Rad4/XPC protein levels (4Ortolan T.G. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Madura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Ng J.M. Vermeulen W. van der Horst G.T. Bergink S. Sugasawa K. Vrieling H.

Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Madura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that Rad23 may regulate cellular Rad4 levels by affecting its transcription (8Gillette T.G. Yu S. Zhou Z. Waters R. Johnston S.A. Reed S.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2529-2538PubMed Google Scholar). UPP is a highly conserved system essential for controlling turnover of numerous proteins in eukaryotic cells (9Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence demonstrate that UPP plays important roles in regulating Rad4 and NER. Initially, it was found that Rad23 physically interacts with the 19 S regulatory particle (RP) of the proteasome (10Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies indicate that Rad4 protein levels are stabilized in a variety of proteasome mutants (8Gillette T.G. Yu S. Zhou Z. Waters R. Johnston S.A. Reed S.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2529-2538PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lommel L. Ortolan T. Chen L. Madura K. Sweder K.S. Curr. Genetics. 2002; 42: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Further analysis points to an antagonistic effect of the RP on NER, since mutations in Rpt6 or Rpt4, two AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) ATPases that are RP subunits and function in unfolding substrates (12Hanna J. Finley D. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2854-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), partially rescue the NER defect in rad23Δ cells (13Gillette T.G. Huang W. Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Johnston S.A. Friedberg E.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mutation in Rpt6 also recovers Rad4 levels in rad23Δ (4Ortolan T.G. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Madura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that deficiency in the RP inhibits proteolysis of Rad4, thus increasing DNA repair. In contrast to the 19 S RP, however, mutations in subunits of the 20S core particle (CP) of the proteasome do not improve NER in rad23Δ, which suggests an unknown non-proteolytic mechanism might also exist (13Gillette T.G. Huang W. Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Johnston S.A. Friedberg E.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Notably, the yeast E3 ligase complex Rad7-Rad16, responsible for attaching ubiquitin to Rad4 has been identified recently and controls its proteolysis in response to UV radiation (8Gillette T.G. Yu S. Zhou Z. Waters R. Johnston S.A. Reed S.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2529-2538PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is a reversible process, and the removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains from substrates is catalyzed by the activity of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Sequence analysis has identified 17 cysteine ubiquitin proteases in the yeast genome, among which 16 are of the ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBP) class (14Amerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genetics. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). The UBPs are highly divergent, except for conserved Cys and His boxes that likely form part of a catalytically active site (14Amerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 16Baker R.T. Tobias J.W. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23364-23375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence diversity among the UBPs provides their substrate specificity. Yeast Ubp3, for example, specifically deubiquitinates RNA polymerase II (17Kvint K. Uhler J.P. Taschner M.J. Sigurdsson S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 498-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to reversing the ubiquitination process, DUBs also play important roles at the proteasome. The yeast 26 S proteasome is a ∼2.5 MDa protein complex consisting of the RP and CP. Polyubiquitinated substrates are recognized by ubiquitin receptors residing in the RP, and then unfolded before entering the CP for proteolysis (12Hanna J. Finley D. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2854-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). DUBs play a key role at the proteasome, catalyzing the removal of polyubiquitin chains from substrates, since proteins with thermodynamically stable ubiqutin chains are too large to pass through the narrow channel into CP (18Finley D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 477-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Previous studies in yeast have shown that the DUB Rpn11, a subunit of the RP essential for cell viability, is critical for degradation-coupled deubiquitination at the proteasome in vivo and in vitro (19Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 20Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Other DUBs associated with the proteasome include Ubp4, which serves to facilitate degradation (21Papa F.R. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and Ubp6 (22Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H.

Though ubiquitination and degradation of the NER protein Rad4 clearly play critical roles in its regulation, thus far, the role of DUBs in Rad4 activity is not clear. In this study, we screened the yeast DUBs for a potential impact on NER and found that one particular candidate, Ubp3, acts as a negative regulator of this repair pathway. We found that Ubp3 physically interacts with Rad4 and the proteasome, and the ubp3 mutation affects Rad4 stability. Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in the supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Sensitivity to killing by UV was determined by a colony formation assay. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD to an A600 of 0.6. Each culture was diluted, spread on YPD plates, and then irradiated by UV light (254 nm) at the indicated doses. Following UV radiation, the plates were immediately wrapped with aluminum foil and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h, at which time the number of colonies was assessed. UV-associated DNA lesions were quantified by immuno-slot-blot analysis. Yeast cells were grown to early log phase in YPD, harvested, and washed with sterile water. The washed cells were resuspended in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and irradiated with 40 J/m2 UV (254 nm). UV-irradiated cells were allowed to repair by incubating in pre-warmed YPD. Aliquots were taken at the times indicated and genomic DNA was isolated using the glass bead method. All the above steps were carried out under yellow light to avoid photoreactivation. DNA samples were denatured in 0.1 m NaOH and boiled for 5 min before loading. At each time point, equal amounts of DNA (5 µg for 6–4PPs and 100 ng for CPDs) were immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using the Bio-Dot SF microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). Photolesions within the DNA were detected by Western blotting with antibodies against 6–4 PPs and CPDs. Quantification of the slot blots was performed using a PhosphorImager and IMAGEQUANT software (GE Healthcare). After immunoblotting, the membranes were reprobed with 32P-labeled yeast genomic DNA to determine DNA quantity in each sample as a loading control. Yeast genomic DNA was digested by BamHI and then radiolabeled using [α32P]dATP and Primer-It Random Primer Kit (Stratagene) before the reprobing. To characterize endogenous ubiquitination of Rad4, we followed a previously described protocol (23Kaiser P. Tagwerker C. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Geng F. Tansey W.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3616-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed with plasmid pUB221 (expressing His6-tagged ubiquitin under the copper-inducible CUP1 promoter), or the control plasmid pUB175 (expressing untagged ubiquitin under the CUP1 promoter). Cells were induced by adding CuSO4 to the growth medium to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, grown for 135 min at 30 °C, and then harvested. Protein was extracted using glass beads in buffer A (6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), which inhibits subsequent ubiquitin protease activity. The lysate was then centrifuged and 1 ml of supernatant was incubated with 100 µl of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen; pre-equilibrated in buffer A) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected, washed three times with buffer A, three times with A/TI buffer (1 vol buffer A and 3 vol buffer TI: 25 mm Tri-Cl, pH6.8, 20 mm imidazole), and one time with buffer TI. After removing all the liquid, ubiquitinated proteins were eluted by boiling beads in 66 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. Eluates were examined by SDS-PAGE (6% gel) and Western blot analysis. Ubiquitinated Rad4 was detected using TAP-specific antibody. The membrane was reprobed with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Strategene) to assess the loading. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Cycloheximide was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml to block protein synthesis, and a 5-ml aliquot was withdrawn following different incubation times. The total protein in each aliquot was isolated by boiling cell pellets in 100 µl of 1× SDS loading buffer. After centrifugation, 2 µl of the supernatant was analyzed by Western blot. Rad4 and proteasome were purified from Rad4TAP and Rpn11TAP strains, respectively. To purify TAP-tagged protein complexes, we followed a previously described protocol (25Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-liter cultures were grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 1.0. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors), and lysed by bead-beating. After adding 2 ml of 2 m KCl, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight in buffer D (20 mm Tris-Cl pH7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF). The dialyzed extract was transferred to a tube, supplemented with 100 µl of 2 m Tris-Cl pH7.9, 400 µl 5 m NaCl, and 200 µl 10% Nonidet P-40, and incubated with 200 µl IgG-agarose bead suspension at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were collected and washed three times with 20 ml cold wash buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), one time with 20 ml Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl pH8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). IgG beads were transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and mixed with 1 ml of TEV protease cleavage buffer and 10 µl of TEV protease (Invitrogen, 10 units/µl). Beads were incubated 1 h at room temperature and cleaved proteins were saved for protein interaction analysis. UBP3 gene was deleted in the background of Rad4TAP and Rpn11TAP to generate Rad4TAP ubp3Δ and Rpn11TAP ubp3Δ, respectively. The full-length DNA of UBP3 was ligated into the yeast expression vector pYC2/CT (Invitrogen), in which UBP3 is under the control of galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. The recombinant plasmid, pYC2-UBP3, was transformed into Rad4TAP ubp3Δ and Rpn11TAP ubp3Δ strains to express Ubp3 tagged with V5 and His6 epitopes. Yeast cells harboring pYC2-UBP3 were grown in yeast synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (SC-Ura−, glucose) to an A600 of 1.0. Cells were harvested and washed with sterile water, and then resuspended in galactose medium (SC-Ura−, galactose) to induce Ubp3 expression at 30 °C for 12 h. Rad4 and proteasomes were purified as described above. The association of Ubp3 with Rad4 and the proteasome was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). After detecting Ubp3, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with the antibody against the TAP tag. To express and purify Ubp3 from Escherichia coli, the full-length DNA of UBP3 was cloned into the expression vector pET30a. BL21 cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid pET30a-UBP3 and plated onto selective agar. A single colony was picked for expansion overnight at 37 °C in 20 ml of LB/Kan media, and then diluted to 200 ml of fresh media and grown to an A600 of 0.6. Expression of Ubp3 was induced by addition of IPTG, to a final concentration of 0.8 mm, at 30 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with cold water. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of cold E. coli lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and cells were lysed by sonication (10 s sonication with 8 s breaks, 24 cycles). Cell lysate was centrifuged at 13 K rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Ubp3-His6 was purified with Ni-NTA-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Approximately 400 ng of Ubp3-His6 was mixed with 200 ng of purified Rad4 or proteasome in incubation buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT) at 37 °C for 30 min. 20 µl Ni-NTA-agarose beads were added and incubated with the mixture at 4 °C for 30 min to precipitate Ubp3-His6. Beads were collected and washed extensively with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 40 mm imidazole). Proteins retained on the beads were eluted with 100 µl of wash buffer plus 250 mm imidazole, and 20 µl aliquots were analyzed by Western blot analysis. We quantified Western blots using ImageQuant software for integration of bands with background correction, as previously described (Ref. 26Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods. 2000; 22: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, and manufacturer's manual). Briefly, for well-resolved bands, pixel intensities above and below the band can be used for calculation of a linear background. After subtracting the background, the signal of the band was normalized to the corresponding loading control band (actin or tubulin, in most cases), and this value was used to evaluate protein levels. To identify DUBs that may play a role in NER, we examined the UV sensitivity of yeast strains deficient in individual DUBs. As shown in Fig. 1A, the ubp3 cells were more resistant to UV, whereas several other DUB mutants showed increased UV sensitivity. Cell survival curve also demonstrates that cells lacking Ubp3 gain resistance to UV irradiation (Fig. 1B). We chose to focus on Ubp3 in this study, as it was previously shown to deubiquitinate UV-arrested RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and prevent RNAPII degradation (17Kvint K. Uhler J.P. Taschner M.J. Sigurdsson S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 498-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), thus highlighting the likely involvement of Ubp3 in the cellular response to UV damage. All UBPs share highly conserved Cys and His boxes (15Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genetics. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar), and mutation of the conserved Cys residue of Ubp3 (C469A) abolishes its catalytic activity (27Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, expression of Ubp3 in the ubp3 mutant restored the lower UV resistance observed for wt cells, while plasmid containing Ubp3-C469A failed to reduce the UV resistance of ubp3. The yeast protein Bre5 is a co-factor of Ubp3, necessary for full Ubp3-deubiquitinating activity (27Cohen M. Stutz F. Belgareh N. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Dargemont C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We found that mutant bre5 cells were resistant to UV at a similar level to that of ubp3 cells (Fig. 1D), consistent with a function for Upb3 in suppressing UV resistance. Taken together, these data indicate that the deubiquitinase Ubp3 is a negative regulator of a cellular response to UV irradiation. To test the possible effects of Ubp3 on the Rad4-Rad23 heterodimer, we mutated the UBP3 gene in the genetic background of rad23 and rad4, respectively. The rad23 mutant, in agreement with a previous report (6Mueller J.P. Smerdon M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), showed moderate UV sensitivity (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, disruption of the UBP3 gene partially suppressed the UV sensitivity of rad23 (Fig. 2A). The extreme UV sensitivity caused by deletion of RAD4, however, was not rescued by ubp3 mutation (Fig. 2B). UV radiation triggers numerous signaling pathways in the cell (28Herrlich P. Karin M. Weiss C. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 279-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The suppression of UV sensitivity in a rad23 background by deleting UBP3 could reflect enhanced NER or influence on other aspects of cellular responses to UV radiation. To characterize whether ubp3 mutation can promote NER in rad23, we directly measured the removal of UV-induced photoproducts from yeast genomic DNA at different repair times by immuno-slot-blot using antibodies specific for 6–4 PPs (Fig. 2C, left panel) and CPDs (Fig. 2D, left panel). To evaluate loading of each sample, we radiolabeled yeast genomic DNA using random sequence primers, and reprobed the membranes (supplemental Fig. S1). The quantified immuno-slot-blot antibody signals were normalized to the corresponding DNA loading signals, and the results for each time point are shown in the right hand panels of Fig. 2, C and D. The results show that global repair of 6–4 PPs and CPDs in wt cells was fast, with only about 20% of the lesions remaining 1 h after UV radiation. In agreement with previous results (13Gillette T.G. Huang W. Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Johnston S.A. Friedberg E.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), NER in rad23 was much slower than in wt cells. We observed that the removal of 6–4 PPs and CPDs was increased in rad23ubp3 compared with rad23, although it was still less efficient than that of wt (Fig. 2, C and D). These results are consistent with the increased UV resistance, indicating that ubp3 mutation provides enhanced NER in rad23. Because the ubp3 mutation partially restored UV resistance in rad23, but showed no such effect in rad4 (Fig. 2), we tested the possibility that Ubp3 regulates cellular Rad4 abundance. We examined the steady-state levels of Rad4 in a Rad4TAP strain, in which the chromosomal RAD4 was fused with the tandem affinity purification (TAP) epitope. The TAP tag consists of a calmodulin binding peptide (CBP), a tobacco etch virus protease (TEV protease) cleavage site, and two IgG binding domains of protein A (25Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). The Rad4TAP strain has been used previously to study Rad4 modification and degradation, and the tagged protein proved to be as functional as the unmodified Rad4 (29den Dulk B. van Eijk P. de Ruijter M. Brandsma J.A. Brouwer J. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 858-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Indeed, our UV survival data also indicate that Rad4TAP is fully functional in NER (supplemental Fig. S2). The cellular levels of Rad4TAP were detected by immunoblotting with anti-TAP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the abundance of Rad4 was modestly increased in ubp3 compared with wt. Mutation of RAD23 resulted in a significant reduction in Rad4, consistent with previous studies (5Xie Z. Liu S. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5981-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Gillette T.G. Yu S. Zhou Z. Waters R. Johnston S.A. Reed S.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2529-2538PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the levels of Rad4 were increased by ∼70% in rad23ubp3 compared with rad23 (Fig. 3, A and B, p < 0.05), indicating that loss of Rad4 in the rad23 cells is partially but significantly restored by the ubp3 defect. Overexpression of Ubp3, however, did not show a significant effect on Rad4 levels in either wt or rad23 cells (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that the function of Ubp3 in regulating Rad4 may require additional factors. To test whether Rad4 levels are affected by the TAP tag, we examined cellular Rad4 levels in a Rad4HA strain, in which the chromosomal RAD4 was tagged by the small hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (4Ortolan T.G. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Madura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In agreement with our observations for the Rad4TAP strain, reduced Rad4 levels in rad23 were also partially restored by mutation of UBP3 in the Rad4HA strain (Fig. 3, C and D, p < 0.05). Moreover, whereas introduction of the plasmid containing wt UBP3 reduced Rad4 abundance in rad23ubp3 to the level seen in rad23, the plasmid containing UBP3-C469A mutant was unable to affect Rad4 levels (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that the deubiquitinating activity of Ubp3 is indispensable for down-regulating Rad4 protein levels. Considering Rad23 is important for stabilizing Rad4 from proteasomal degradation and mutation of UBP3 can significantly rescue the loss of Rad4 caused by rad23Δ, we investigated the effect of Ubp3 on Rad4 stability in vivo. We compared Rad4 stability in both wt and ubp3 by adding the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) to actively growing yeast cells. Aliquots of cultures were then withdrawn at different times and proteins were isolated for Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, E and F, Rad4 levels in wt were decreased after 2 h of protein synthesis inhibition, whereas degradation of Rad4 in ubp3 was significantly slower than in wt. Similarly, the stability of Rad4 was also increased in rad23ubp3 compared with that in rad23 (supplemental Fig. S4), suggesting that Rad4 protein is indeed stabilized by ubp3 mutation. We also performed pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine and found the degradation of Rad4 in ubp3 is slower than that in wt (supplemental Fig. S5). As a deubiquitinase, Ubp3 targets its substrates through protein-protein interaction (17Kvint K. Uhler J.P. Taschner M.J. Sigurdsson S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 1954-1961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that Rad4 is a substrate of Ubp3 binding, we verified the interaction between Rad4 and Ubp3. We transformed the Rad4TAPubp3 strain with a CEN plasmid expressing V5His6-tagged Ubp3 (Ubp3-V5His6) and tested whether Ubp3 can be co-purified with Rad4TAP. Plasmid-expressed Ubp3-V5His6 rescued the slow-growing phenotype of ubp3 on yeast media lacking uracil, suggesting that the fusion protein is functional (data not shown). The Rad4TAP protein was captured from cell extracts with IgG beads, and then specifically released using TEV protease. Purified Rad4TAP migrated slightly faster than unpurified protein (Fig. 4A, middle panel), which was caused by the TEV-directed cleavage of two IgG binding domains from the TAP epitope. Ubp3, detected by V5-specific antibody, was co-purified with Rad4TAP (Fig. 4A, upper panel), indicating that Rad4 and Ubp3 interact in vivo. The lower band may reflect partial degradation of Ubp3 during protein isolation, as it was also present in the input samples (Fig. 4A, upper panel). As a control, actin was not found in the purified Rad4TAP sample (Fig. 4A, bottom panel), suggesting that the interaction between Ubp3 and Rad4 is specific. In addition, we examined the interaction between Rad4 and Ubp3 in vitro. As expected, Rad4TAP was pulled down with Ubp3-His6 by Ni-NTA resin (Fig. 4B, lane 6), while Rad4TAP alone did not bind to Ni-NTA resin (Fig. 4B, lane 4), indicating that Rad4 and Ubp3 also interact in vitro. Although little is known about the endogenous ubiquitination status of Rad4, several lines of evidence suggest that Rad4 ubiquitination occurs in the cell (4Ortolan T.G. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Madura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11Lommel L. Ortolan T. Chen L. Madura K. Sweder K.S. Curr. Genetics. 2002; 42: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because our results indicated that Rad4 protein levels are down-regulated by Ubp3, we explored the role for Ubp3 in Rad4 ubiquitination. To detect ubiquitinated Rad4, we transformed the Rad4TAP strain with a plasmid expressing His6-tagged ubiquitin. After cell lysis in denaturing conditions (see Experimen"
https://openalex.org/W2031325573,"The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family and have been implicated in tumorigenesis. One isoform in particular, JNK2α, has been shown to be frequently activated in primary brain tumors, to enhance several tumorigenic phenotypes and to increase tumor formation in mice. As JNK is frequently activated in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), we investigated the role of the JNK2α isoform in NSCLC formation by examining its expression in primary tumors and by modulating its expression in cultured cell lines. We discovered that 60% of the tested primary NSCLC tumors had three-fold higher JNK2 protein and two- to three-fold higher JNK2α mRNA expression than normal lung control tissue. To determine the importance of JNK2α in NSCLC progression, we reduced JNK2α expression in multiple NSCLC cell lines using short hairpin RNA. Cell lines deficient in JNK2α had decreased cellular growth and anchorage-independent growth, and the tumors were four-fold smaller in mass. To elucidate the mechanism by which JNK2α induces NSCLC growth, we analyzed the JNK substrate, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Our data demonstrates for the first time that JNK2α can regulate the transcriptional activity of STAT3 by phosphorylating the Ser727 residue, thereby regulating the expression of oncogenic genes, such as c-Myc. Furthermore, reintroduction of JNK2α2 or STAT3 restored the tumorigenicity of the NSCLC cells, demonstrating that JNK2α is important for NSCLC progression. Our studies reveal a novel mechanism in which phosphorylation of STAT3 is mediated by a constitutively active JNK2 isoform, JNK2α."

The canonical pathway for GFAP expression in astrocytes is triggered by the binding of cytokines from the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family to their receptors.

For example, some members of the tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of cytokines have little or no effect on GFAP synthesis by themselves, but they strongly potentiate GFAP induced by the IL-6 family of cytokines. They do so by triggering the phosphorylation, activation, and heterodimerization of Smad proteins, which then form a more potent transcriptional complex with p300/CBP and Stat3.

All-trans-retinoic acid (RA), generally considered to be a neurogenic agent, is in fact a potent inducer of GFAP (14Herrera F. Chen Q. Fischer W.H. Maher P. Schubert D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Ray J. Gage F.H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 560-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Faigle R.

Res. 2004; 75: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Studies with pharmacological agonists for the different retinoic acid receptors indicate that retinoic acid-induced GFAP expression is mediated by the activation of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) α and, to a lesser extent, RARγ (16Faigle R. Liu L. Cundiff P. Funa K. Xia Z. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1681-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Goncalves M.B. Boyle J. Webber D.J. Hall S. Minger S.L. Corcoran J.P. Dev. Biol. 2005; 278: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Other than a potential role for these receptors, little is known about the mechanisms involved in retinoic acid-induced GFAP synthesis. The relationship between retinoic acid and cytokine signaling pathways depends strongly upon the biological context. For example, retinoic acid inhibits GFAP-associated astrocyte differentiation induced by ciliary neurotrophic factor, an IL-6 family cytokine, in rat neural precursor cells isolated from embryonic day 13 brains but potentiates it in precursor cells from embryonic day 17 brains (16Faigle R. Liu L. Cundiff P. Funa K. Xia Z. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1681-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Very recently, Asano et al. (19Asano H. Aonuma M. Sanosaka T. Kohyama J. Namihira M. Nakashima K. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2744-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) also showed that retinoic acid and the IL-6 family of cytokines have a synergistic effect on astrogliogenesis in mouse neural precursor cells from embryonic day 14.5. Outside the CNS, the combination of retinoic acid with cytokines enhances some biological effects (20Metallo C.M. Ji L. de Pablo J.J. Palecek S.P. Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Martín-Ibáñez R. Urbán N. Sergent-Tanguy S. Pineda J.R. Garrido-Clua N. Alberch J. Canals J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 2686-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and counteracts others (22Hoffman L.M. Garcha K. Karamboulas K. Cowan M.F. Drysdale L.M. Horton W.A. Underhill T.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, although it is clear that there is some kind of interaction between retinoic acid and cytokine signaling pathways, the precise nature of this interaction is unclear. In the work outlined below, we examined the interaction between retinoic acid and cytokine signaling pathways in the control of GFAP expression. Our results provide new insights into the pathways underlying the expression of GFAP and into the role of cytokine and retinoic acid signaling in the CNS. The HCN-B27 clone of adult hippocampal precursor cells was isolated in our laboratory as described previously (23Schubert D. Klar A. Park M. Dargusch R. Fischer W.H. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as a subclone of the rat adult hippocampal precursor cell line (HCA) (15Ray J. Gage F.H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 560-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Procedures for cell culture were described elsewhere (14Herrera F. Chen Q. Fischer W.H. Maher P. Schubert D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in Neurobasal medium plus B27 supplement without antioxidants (Invitrogen) and seeded in DMEM/Ham's F-12 1:1 medium plus N2 supplement (Invitrogen) for all experiments. Retinoic acid was purchased from Sigma, and retinoic acid receptor agonists and antagonists were from Biomol International LP (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Human recombinant BMP-2 was obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and LIF was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem. Plasmids for luciferase expression under the control of serial deletions of the rat GFAP promoter were kindly provided by Dr. Caleb E. Finch (University of Southern California Davis School of Gerontology, Los Angeles, CA) (24Krohn K. Rozovsky I. Wals P. Teter B. Anderson C.P. Finch C.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking the half-RARα response element were generated from the plasmid containing the full-length promoter (Fig. 2A, A1) by means of the mutagenesis QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene, San Diego). The primers used were 5′AT GAG GTC CAG TCT AAA CTG GGA ACC TCT CTC AG and 5′CT GAG AGA GGT TCC CAG TTT AGA CTG GAC CTC AT. The reporter plasmid for luciferase expression under the control of a classic DR-5 retinoic acid response element was a kind gift from Drs. Thomas Sternsdorf and Ron Evans (Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid transfection was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and luciferase assays were carried out by means of the dual-light combined reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). In all cases, the manufacturer's instructions were followed. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared with a kit from Epigentek (Brooklyn, NY). The binding of RARα to the half-retinoic acid response element identified in the rat GFAP promoter was determined by the EpiQuikTM general protein-DNA binding assay kit (Fluorometric) from Epigentek. This kit is designed for measuring the binding activity of transcription factors to DNA in nuclear extracts. Briefly, the RARα present in the nuclear extracts of precursor cells is captured by a specific antibody onto the assay microwells. A double strand oligonucleotide containing the half-retinoic acid response element previously identified is added into the microwell and bound to the active RARα in the binding assay buffer. The bound oligonucleotide is then detected fluorometrically. The manufacturer's instructions were followed for both the nuclear extraction and the protein-DNA binding assay. Procedures for protein extraction and Western blotting were described previously (14Herrera F. Chen Q. Fischer W.H. Maher P. Schubert D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For Western blots, antibodies against the following proteins were used at the indicated dilutions: GFAP (1:2000) from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); actin (1:1000, Sigma); GAPDH (1:10,000, Labfrontier, Republic of South Korea); p300/CBP (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-Stat3(Ser-727), phospho-Stat3 (Tyr-705), Stat3, phospho-Smad1(Ser-463/465)/Smad5(Ser-463/465)/Smad8 (Ser-426/428), Smad1, and RARα (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA). For immunoprecipitations, antibodies against the following proteins were used at the indicated dilutions: p300/CBP and RARα (1:20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Stat3 and Smad1 (1:100 and 1:200, Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA). The protocol suggested by Cell Signaling Technologies for immunoprecipitation was followed in all cases. Briefly, 400 μg of protein in 100 μl of lysis buffer was incubated with the selected antibodies overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The next day, the samples were incubated with protein A- (for rabbit antibodies) or protein G (for mouse antibodies)-agarose for another 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. Samples were washed five times and resuspended in 20 μl of SDS 3× buffer, boiled for 3 min, and spun down. The supernatants were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and blotted with the antibodies using general Western blot methods, as described previously (14Herrera F. Chen Q. Fischer W.H. Maher P. Schubert D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). siRNA against p300/CBP was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. It was introduced into the cells by transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Results are shown as the means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Statistic analyses included a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. GFAP expression in the HCNB27 clone of adult rat neural precursor cells can be induced to different degrees by retinoic acid, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, IL-6 family), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Fig. 1, A–C). Although there is not a significant increase in GFAP expression when cells are incubated with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) alone, BMP-2 strongly potentiates the effect of LIF (Fig. 1, A and B), consistent with previous observations by us and others (13Yanagisawa M. Nakashima K. Takizawa T. Ochiai W. Arakawa H. Taga T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Herrera F. Chen Q. Fischer W.H. Maher P. Schubert D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The addition of FBS to this combination of cytokines or to retinoic acid alone leads to an additive effect on GFAP levels, i.e. the final effect is more or less equal to the sum of the specific effects of serum and the compounds. In contrast, when retinoic acid is added to the cultures in combination with the cytokines, the final effect is much greater than the sum of the effects of retinoic acid and cytokines, indicating that they synergize (Fig. 1, A–C). Further addition of FBS does not increase the effect of cytokines plus retinoic acid. Importantly, these effects on GFAP expression are seen at physiological concentrations of retinoic acid (nanomolar range) (Fig. 1D), indicating that our observations are not the result of using supraphysiological concentrations of retinoic acid. Previous reports indicated that retinoic acid-induced GFAP expression in vitro was mediated by RARα and, to a lesser extent, by RARγ (16Faigle R. Liu L. Cundiff P. Funa K. Xia Z. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1681-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Goncalves M.B. Boyle J. Webber D.J. Hall S. Minger S.L. Corcoran J.P. Dev. Biol. 2005; 278: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In HCNB27 cells, the RARα-specific agonist AM-580 induced GFAP, but to a lesser extent than the pan-RAR agonists retinoic acid and [(E)-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl]benzoic acid (TTNB) (Fig. 1E), indicating that RARα activation is sufficient for its expression but that other RARs probably contribute to the maximal response. On the other hand, Ro-415253 (250 nm), a specific RARα antagonist, completely blocked retinoic acid-induced GFAP expression (Fig. 1E), further supporting the idea that RARα activation is necessary (16Faigle R. Liu L. Cundiff P. Funa K. Xia Z. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1681-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Goncalves M.B. Boyle J. Webber D.J. Hall S. Minger S.L. Corcoran J.P. Dev. Biol. 2005; 278: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To determine whether the synergism between retinoic acid and cytokines was at the transcriptional level, HCNB27 cells transfected with plasmids encoding luciferase under the control of the full-length rat GFAP promoter were incubated with combinations of retinoic acid and either BMP-2 or LIF, and the luciferase activity was determined (Fig. 2, A and B) (24Krohn K. Rozovsky I. Wals P. Teter B. Anderson C.P. Finch C.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The combination of either LIF or BMP-2 with RA had a synergistic effect on the activity of the promoter (Fig. 2B), indicating that both cytokines contribute to the synergism and that the synergy occurs at the transcriptional level. To identify the response element responsible for retinoic acid-induced expression of GFAP, the expression of luciferase was placed under the control of serial deletions of the rat GFAP promoter (Fig. 2A) (24Krohn K. Rozovsky I. Wals P. Teter B. Anderson C.P. Finch C.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and HCNB27 cells were exposed to retinoic acid (Fig. 2C). There was a striking decrease in retinoic acid-induced luciferase activity upon deletion of the terminal fragment from −1876 to −1546, indicating that this region contains a response element for RARα. The classic consensus retinoic acid response element consists of a direct repeat of the sequence AGGTCA with a 2–5-bp spacer. We searched the rat GFAP promoter for classical retinoic acid response elements by means of the Tfsitescan free software, but we were unable to find any. The closest sequence we found was a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ/retinoid-related orphan receptor α response element situated between positions −1843 and −1837 (AGGTCA), which is half of the consensus retinoic acid response element. The specific deletion of this site from the GFAP promoter blocked retinoic acid-induced luciferase activity, strongly indicating that this sequence is acting as the response element for retinoic acid signaling in the GFAP promoter (Fig. 2, A, D and E). Interestingly, we also found this half-response element, but not the classical response element, in the mouse and human GFAP promoters (positions −192 and −62 and, −1118 and −1298, respectively), indicating that it could also be relevant for retinoic acid-induced glial differentiation in mouse and human cells. However, we cannot exclude the presence of classical RAREs further than 2 kb from the start of the GFAP gene, the promoter length we analyzed. A recent report from Asano et al. (19Asano H. Aonuma M. Sanosaka T. Kohyama J. Namihira M. Nakashima K. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2744-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) described a full RARE at 2.5 kb from the start of the mouse GFAP gene. This RARE exerts an inhibitory effect on LIF-induced GFAP expression. Although its deletion or mutation has no visible effect on the expression of GFAP induced by retinoic or the combination of retinoic acid and LIF, it potentiates GFAP expression induced by LIF alone. Therefore, classical RAREs may have a role on GFAP expression different from the half-response element we identified. The deletion of the half-retinoic acid response element also partially blocked the synergistic effect of retinoic acid and cytokines and, most surprisingly, the transcriptional activity induced by LIF alone (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, consistent with a role for RARα in LIF-induced GFAP expression, the RARα-specific antagonist Ro-415253 (250 nm) partially prevented GFAP expression induced by either LIF alone, the combination of retinoic acid and cytokines, or BMP plus LIF (Figs. 2F and 4A). There are a few key events in the retinoic acid and cytokine GFAP expression pathways that have been extensively confirmed. In the case of the cytokine pathway, these key events are the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of Smad and Stat proteins and their binding to p300/CBP (9Rajan P. McKay R.D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3620-3629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). In the case of the retinoic acid pathway, it is the only activation of RARα (Fig. 1E) (16Faigle R. Liu L. Cundiff P. Funa K. Xia Z. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1681-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Goncalves M.B. Boyle J. Webber D.J. Hall S. Minger S.L. Corcoran J.P. Dev. Biol. 2005; 278: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on the transcriptional data, we hypothesized that the cross-talk between retinoic acid and the cytokine pathways that leads to the observed synergism involved one or more of these transcription factors. To determine how the transcription factors regulate this synergism, we first examined the phosphorylation state of key activation residues in Smad1/5/8 and Stat3 and the expression of RARα after incubation with the different combinations of cytokines (Fig. 3, A–D). LIF induced the phosphorylation of Stat3 at Tyr-705 and Ser-727, and BMP-2 induced the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, as expected, but retinoic acid did not potentiate any of these events. Interestingly, retinoic acid induced a decrease in RARα expression that could represent a negative feedback and a decrease in Smad1 expression that is prevented by BMP-2 but not by LIF (Fig. 3, A, B and D). On the other hand, both BMP-2 and LIF promoted RARα expression and reduced significantly the loss of RARα induced by retinoic acid (Fig. 3, A and B). Cytokines also potentiated the binding of RARα to the half-response element that we identified (Fig. 3E), and furthermore, they potentiated the transcriptional activity of retinoic acid receptors when luciferase expression was under the control of the classical DR-5 retinoic acid response element (Fig. 3F). Together, these results indicate that cytokines potentiate the retinoic acid GFAP pathway by up-regulating RARα expression and activity. We have shown previously that PI3K plays a key role in both retinoic acid- and cytokine-induced astrogliogenesis (14Herrera F. Chen Q. Fischer W.H. Maher P. Schubert D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To know if it is also involved in the synergism between retinoic acid and cytokines, cells were incubated with the cytokine and/or retinoic acid with or without the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm) or the specific RARα inhibitor Ro-415253 (250 nm). Although the RARα inhibitor had a partial antagonistic effect on GFAP expression, LY294002 completely blocked the GFAP accumulation in response to both the combination of cytokines and the cytokines plus retinoic acid (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor completely blocked the up-regulation of RARα expression and the increase in the phosphorylation of Stat3 and Smad induced by LIF and BMP, respectively (Fig. 4, B–F). In contrast, the RARα inhibitor did not block these events (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 1). The formation of the Stat3-p300/CBP-Smad transcriptional complex is essential for the synergism between LIF and BMP-2 (25Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), and p300/CBP is critical for retinoic acid signaling in other experimental models (26Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 27Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. Coetzee G.A. Nelson C.C. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 898-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We observed that knocking down the expression of p300/CBP partially blocked retinoic acid- and cytokine-induced GFAP expression (Fig. 5A), supporting a role for p300/CBP in both pathways. Interestingly, the decrease in p300/CBP expression also leads to down-regulation of the expression of RARα (Fig. 5A). Based on these data, we hypothesized that RARα can form a complex with p300/CBP, Stat3, and Smad proteins during astrogliogenesis. As expected, the binding of Stat3 and Smad1/5/8 proteins to p300/CBP was induced by LIF and BMP-2, respectively (Fig. 5B). Both cytokines induced the binding of RARα to p300/CBP in the presence or absence of retinoic acid, and this effect was much greater when LIF was combined with retinoic acid. Although the specific RARα inhibitor Ro-415253 only reduced the binding of RARα to p300/CBP (Fig. 5C), the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 reduced the binding of Smad, Stat3, and RARα to p300/CBP (Fig. 5D). Thus, our results strongly indicate that PI3K is upstream of all the key events leading to GFAP expression in both nerve-glial precursor populations and astrocytes induced by either retinoic acid or cytokines and that it also regulates the cross-talk and synergy between these two pathways. We and others have demonstrated that RARα is essential for retinoic acid-induced GFAP expression (Fig. 1E) (16Faigle R. Liu L. Cundiff P. Funa K. Xia Z. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1681-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Goncalves M.B. Boyle J. Webber D.J. Hall S. Minger S.L. Corcoran J.P. Dev. Biol. 2005; 278: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the observation that the specific RARα antagonist Ro-415253 reduces cytokine-induced GFAP expression as well suggests that cytokines also require RARα for the full induction of this protein. Here, we show that cytokines potentiate the expression of RARα, its binding to DNA and to the Stat3-p300/CBP-Smad complex, as well as the transcriptional activity induced by retinoic acid (Figs. 3, A, B, D, and E, and 5, A–C). However, cytokines do not increase classical DR-5 RARE-mediated transcriptional activity by themselves (Fig. 3F). The mechanism of action of Ro-415253 is not well understood, but it is known that it does not prevent RARα from binding to DNA or to other RARs and retinoid X receptors. The existing evidence suggests that it causes a change in the final conformation of the RARα protein that makes the receptor inactive (28Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apfel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We observed that this antagonist reduced the cytokine-stimulated binding of RARα to p300/CBP (Fig. 5B). This may be explained by a change in conformation, explaining the effect of Ro-415253 on RARα activity and on cytokine-induced GFAP expression. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that RARα plays a central role in the regulation of GFAP expression and that it acts as an important cofactor of the Stat3-p300/CBP-Smad complex. Our results are supported and complemented by reports showing synergism between retinoic acid and the IL-6 family of cytokines in the induction of GFAP expression in precursor cells (16Faigle R. Liu L. Cundiff P. Funa K. Xia Z. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1681-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Asano H. Aonuma M. Sanosaka T. Kohyama J. Namihira M. Nakashima K. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2744-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid has been proposed to potentiate LIF-induced astrogliogenesis by means of an epigenetic mechanism involving histone acetylation (19Asano H. Aonuma M. Sanosaka T. Kohyama J. Namihira M. Nakashima K. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 2744-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). p300/CBP has histone acetyltransferase activity, which is regulated by its binding to various transcription factors, such as the Stat, Smad, or RAR families (12Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Taga T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 27Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. Coetzee G.A. Nelson C.C. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 898-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that RARα binds to p300/CBP in the context of GFAP regulation. Thus, RARα could potentiate p300/CBP acetyltransferase activity in collaboration with Stat and Smad proteins, leading to acetylation of histones near the GFAP promoter, further exposing the promoter to Stat3 and Smad transcription factors and, ultimately, to an enhancement of GFAP expression. Based on these data, we present a revised version of the canonical pathway for the regulation of GFAP expression during development. Precursor cells and the promoters for genes such as GFAP that are expressed in astrocytes and genes from the canonical astrocyte JAK/STAT pathway must be derepressed and demethylated (Fig. 6, step 1) (29Fan G. Martinowich K. Chin M.H. He F. Fouse S.D. Hutnick L. Hattori D. Ge W. Shen Y. Wu H. ten Hoeve J. Shuai K. Sun Y.E. Development. 2005; 132: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In the presence of cytokines from the IL-6 family, the JAK/STAT pathway is activated, and this pathway is potentiated when cytokines from the TGF-β family are also present (Fig. 6, steps 2 and 3). These cytokines induce the expression of RARα, which, in the presence of retinoic acid, is activated (Fig. 6, step 4). The binding of activated RARα to the Stat3-p300/CBP-Smad complex is potentiated by the cytokines, and its binding enhances even further the transcriptional activity of the complex (Fig. 6, step 5). Although the generation of astrocytes occurs during a relatively short period of time, astrocytes are the major cell type in the brain, indicating that there is a striking, acute increase in the number of astrocytes in the perinatal period. The synergy between retinoic acid and cytokines could explain why this happens (Fig. 6, step 6). PI3K is upstream of all of these events, a fact that is consistent with previous reports from several laboratories, including ours, showing a role for various proteins from the PI3K pathway in astrogliogenesis or in the regulation of known components of the astrogliogenic pathway, such as Stat3 (14Herrera F.

Also, some genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increase in GFAP expression and astrocyte number (33Mito T. Becker L.E. Exp.

Although reactive gliosis serves as a defensive response, it can be detrimental for the recovery of damaged tissue (32Pekny M. Nilsson M.

If GFAP is required for astrocyte differentiation and viability, then the inhibition of GFAP synthesis may improve the chances for recovery from tissue damage. Glioblastomas are the most common and deadly type of brain tumor. Their origin is still unknown, but current evidence strongly indicates that they are generated from cells with stem cell properties that proliferate and undertake incomplete, aberrant differentiation into astroglia-like cells that weakly express GFAP (6Prestegarden L. Svendsen A. Wang J. Sleire L. Skaftnesmo K.O. Bjerkvig R. Yan T. Askland L. Persson A. Sakariassen P.Ø. Enger P.Ø. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 4274-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Directing these cells to a fully nonproliferative and differentiated state could improve the effectiveness of the treatments against these types of tumors. Retinoids have, in fact, a strong antitumoral effect in glioblastoma cells both in cell cultures and patients (37Yung W.K. Kyritsis A.P. Gleason M.J. Levin V.A. Clin.

In summary, understanding the pathways involved in GFAP expression in both precursor cells and astrocytes should allow the identification of molecular targets for manipulating these cell types in pathological conditions. Our results indicate that approaches targeting both IL-6 and retinoic acid signaling may be a mechanism to achieve this end. Download .pdf (.47 MB) Help with pdf files"

Despite the absence of phycobilisomes, this high-light adapted strain possesses β-phycoerythrin (CpeB), an S-type lyase (CpeS), and enzymes for the biosynthesis of phycoerythrobilin (PEB) and phycocyanobilin. Of all linear tetrapyrroles synthesized by Prochlorococcus including their 3Z- and 3E-isomers, CpeS binds both isomers of PEB and its biosynthetic precursor 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin (DHBV). However, dimerization of CpeS is independent of bilins, which are tightly bound in a complex at a ratio of 1:1. Although bilin binding by CpeS is fast, transfer to CpeB is rather slow. CpeS is able to attach 3E-PEB and 3Z-PEB to dimeric CpeB but not DHBV. CpeS transfer of 3Z-PEB exclusively yields correctly bound βCys82-PEB, whereas βCys82-DHBV is a side product of 3E-PEB transfer. Spontaneous 3E- and 3Z-PEB addition to CpeB is faulty, and products are in both cases βCys82-DHBV and likely a PEB bound at βCys82 in a non-native configuration. Our data indicate that CpeS is specific for 3Z-PEB transfer to βCys82 of phycoerythrin and essential for the correct configuration of the attachment product.

Phycobilisomes are the major light-harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria, rhodo-phytes, and cryptophytes (1Glazer A.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys.

The light-absorbing properties of corresponding phycobiliproteins result from up to four linear tetrapyrroles, known as bilins, covalently bound via thioether bonds to conserved cysteine residues of each α and β subunit. Bilins are derived from heme, which is converted to the first linear tetrapyrrole biliverdin IXα (BV IXα) 2The abbreviations used are: BV IXαbiliverdin IXαDHBV15,16-dihydrobili-verdinITCisothermal titration calorimetryPEphycoerythrinPEBphycoerythrobilinPCBphycocyanobilin. by heme oxygenases (3Frankenberg-Dinkel N.

In cyanobacteria, BV IXα is further reduced by ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases to 3Z-phycoerythrobilin (3Z-PEB) or 3Z-phycocyanobilin (3Z-PCB) 3A. W. U. Busch, unpublished data. (4Dammeyer T.

Subsequent bilin attachment to phycobiliproteins is in most cases supported by members of the three known phycobiliprotein lyase families (E/F, S/U, and T) (6Scheer H. Zhao K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These proteins are supposed to guide the reaction in a chaperone-like manner probably by conformational control of the bilin (7Böhm S. Endres S. Scheer H. Zhao K.H. J. Biol.

In addition, some lyases act as isomerases and generate phycoviolobilin or phycourobilin upon attachment to the phycobili-protein (9Fairchild C.D. Zhao J. Zhou J. Colson S.E. Bryant D.A. Glazer A.N.

Whereas PCB, phycourobilin, or phycoviolobilin attaching lyases are well characterized, little is known about lyases specific for attachment of PEB to phycoerythrins (PE). We therefore investigated a putative PEB-transferring lyase encoded by P. marinus MED4 (12Rocap G. Larimer F.W. Lamerdin J. Malfatti S. Chain P. Ahlgren N.A. Arellano A. Coleman M. Hauser L.

Genes associated with phycobiliprotein maturation can be found in highly reduced prochlorococcal as well as in Prochlorococcus-infecting phage genomes indicating the importance of PE for cell fitness (12Rocap G.

Nature. 1998; 393: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). High-light strains inhabit the upper nutrient-depleted but light-irradiated layer of the ocean, whereas low-light strains colonize depths of up to 200 m, which are nutrient-rich but exposed to a low light intensity. Whereas low light-adapted strains encode α and β subunits of PE, HL strains like P. marinus MED4 carry only a degenerated form of β-PE (14Steglich C. Post A.F. Hess W.R. Environ.

P. marinus MED4 possesses one of the smallest genomes of photosynthetic organisms but still encodes all components for phycobiliprotein maturation: β-PE (CpeB), enzymes for PEB and PCB biosynthesis (i.e. HO1, PebA, PebB, and PcyA) and the S-type lyase CpeS (12Rocap G. Larimer F.W. Lamerdin J. Malfatti S. Chain P. Ahlgren N.A. Arellano A. Coleman M. Hauser L. Hess W.R. Johnson Z.I. Land M. Lindell D. Post A.F. Regala W. Shah M. Shaw S.L. Steglich C. Sullivan M.B.

We characterized CpeS from MED4 with respect to bilin specificity and affinity, binding kinetics, and transfer activity. Besides BV IXα and DHBV, both the 3Z- and 3E-isomers of PEB and PCB were included in this study to address the so far unstudied stereoselectivity of lyases. Our results demonstrate that CpeS specifically transfers 3Z-PEB to CpeB and ensures correct configuration of the attachment product. The functionality of the last component of the phycobiliprotein maturation machinery in Prochlorococcus is demonstrated underlining the relevance of PE in this unusual cyanobacterium. The P. marinus MED4 cpeS coding region was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with primers encompassing recognition sites for EcoRI (5′-gaccatgattagaattcgttgacg-3′) and HindIII (5′-ccaagcttgcctgcagagaataat-3′). The PCR product was cloned into expression vector pASKIBA45+ (IBA) for N-terminal fusion of a Strep-tag to CpeS. The resulting plasmid was verified by sequencing. Construction of plasmid pET43a-PE for production of N-terminal NusA His-tagged CpeB was described previously (18Steglich C. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Penno S. Hess W.R. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1611-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A culture of BL21(DE3) carrying the respective overexpression plasmid was incubated at 37 °C to an A580 of 0.6. After induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (100 µm; pET43 derivative) or anhydrotetracycline (200 µg/ml; pASKIBA45+derivative) cells were incubated for 18 h at 17 °C, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (60 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and disrupted by two passages through a French press cell at 20,000 psi. After separation of cell debris the supernatant was loaded on a Talon® metal affinity resin (Clontech; CpeB) or a Strep-Tactin-Sepharose® (IBA; CpeS) column. Purification was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions based on sodium phosphate buffer. If needed, purified CpeB was incubated with thrombin (10 cleavage units/mg CpeB) and dialyzed against cleavage buffer (60 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8). Tag-free CpeB was then purified by a second metal affinity chromatography. Purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer, which was in case of CpeB supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. CpeB was additionally dialyzed twice against buffer to remove dithiothreitol. Concentrations of proteins were determined using the calculated molar extinction coefficient ϵ280 (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). CpeB was incubated with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min and subsequently purified via Nap5 columns (GE Healthcare). Protein samples were analyzed using 12.5% or 15% SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Zinc-blot analyses were carried out as described in (25Wahleithner J.A. Li L.M. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 10387-10391Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). UV-visible absorption measurements were done using an Agilent Technologies 8453 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed with an Aminco-Bowman AB2 spectrofluorimeter. BV IXα was obtained from Frontier Scientific. 3E-PEB and 3E-PCB were isolated from Porphyridium (3E-PEB) or Spirulina (3E-PCB) cells as described in (26Terry M.J. Heme, Chlorophyll, and Bilins, Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 273-291Google Scholar) and references therein.

While 3E-PEB and 3E-PCB were obtained to almost 100% purity, 3Z-PEB and DHBV contained less than 6% and 3Z-PCB less than 10% contaminations. Bilins were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, diluted 1:100 in MeOH/5% HCl, and concentrations were estimated using the following molar extinction coefficients in MeOH/5% HCl: ϵ594 49,000 m−1 cm−1 (3E-PEB) (30Gossauer A.

Biochem. 1991; 195: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Concentrations of 3Z-PEB and DHBV were calculated with the ϵ594 of 3E-PEB and the measured absorption at 571 nm (3Z-PEB) or 564 nm (DHBV) (4Dammeyer T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27081-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at room temperature. Lyase (10 µm) and bilin (5 µm) were incubated for 10 min before affinity purification of CpeS. Columns were washed with increasing NaCl concentrations (100 mm–1 m) and wash fractions screened for released bilins by absorption spectroscopy. Lyase (15 µm) and bilin (30 µm) were incubated in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, for 10 min before affinity purification of CpeS. Absorption spectra of eluted CpeS·bilin complexes were obtained in sodium phosphate buffer and after addition of 0.5 volume of acidic urea (8 m, pH 1.5). Protein concentrations in buffer were determined with the calculated ϵ280 of CpeS (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar), bilin concentrations in acidic urea with ϵ550 42,800 m−1 cm−1 (PEB) (33Glazer A.N. Hixson C.S. J. Biol.

Stopped flow experiments were performed in an SFM-400 apparatus with MOS-200 optics (Bio-Logic) at 20 °C in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Bilin (2 µm) was rapidly mixed with various concentrations of CpeS and the absorption increase at 594 nm (3E-PEB), 590 nm (3Z-PEB), and 607 nm (DHBV) was recorded. Ten time traces were accumulated and averaged each. An exponential equation was fitted to the experimental data yielding the kobs value for each concentration. All experiments were repeated two times. Thermodynamic parameters of CpeS interaction with 3E-PEB at 20 °C in sodium-phosphate buffer pH 7.5 were determined using an isothermal titration microcalorimeter (MicroCal Auto-iTC200, GE Healthcare). The first 0.5 µl of 3E-PEB (300 µm) were injected into the temperature-controlled sample cell containing 200 µl of CpeS (30 µm). The change in heating power was monitored for 180 s until equilibrium was reached before the next 1.8-µl injection was started. Background heat generation from dilution of 3E-PEB in buffer was measured to be irrelevant. The data were averaged over two ITC experiments. An GE Healthcare Superdex 75 HR10/300 GL size exclusion column was equilibrated in sodium phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Standards with known Mr (i.e. bovine serum albumin, 66,000; carbonic anhydrase, 29,000; cytochrome c, 12,400; and aprotinin, 6,500) were applied to the column, and their elution volumes were determined spectroscopically. CpeS and tag-free CpeB were chromatographed under identical conditions. Affinity-purified CpeS·bilin complexes were denaturated in acidic urea (8 m, pH 1.5). Subsequently, bilins were purified as described in Ref. 4Dammeyer T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27081-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and further analyzed on a Luna® C18 reversed-phase HPLC column (Phenomenex) with diode array detection (Agilent 1100 series) (29Frankenberg N.

Total binding of bilin to CpeS was confirmed via absorption spectroscopy. In control experiments, affinity purified CpeS·bilin was used. CpeB (30 µm) was added, and reactions were followed spectroscopically. After 45 min, CpeB was isolated by affinity chromatography and further analyzed. In competition assays, bilin (3.5 µm) was added to CpeS, CpeB, or premixed CpeS/CpeB (7 µm each), and absorption and fluorescence emission spectra were taken immediately. Purified CpeB was digested with trypsin and resulting peptides desalted via a C18 Sep-Pak column (Waters) (4Dammeyer T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27081-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated by HPLC on a Jupiter® C4 (300 Å) column (Phenomenex) (35Zhao K.H. Su P.

Peptides were spotted onto an MTP AnchorChip 800/384 target (Bruker Daltonik) preloaded with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix according to the manufacturer's instructions. MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired using the flexControl 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonik). The instrument was set to positive polarity. Calibration of MS spectra was performed using a peptide mix consisting of bradykinin (757.3992 Da), angiotensin II (1046.5418 Da), Substance P (1347.7354 Da), bombesin (1619.8223 Da), ACTH (2093.0862 Da), and ACTH CLIP (2456.1983 Da). Peak lists were generated from MS and MS/MS spectra with the help of flexAnalysis 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonik). Peak masses from MS data were compared with theoretical masses of peptides containing the covalently linked bilin. MS peaks that matched the theoretical masses were selected as precursor ions for MS/MS analysis to confirm peptide identity. P. marinus MED4 possesses an unusual green light-absorbing β-PE (CpeB) with one PEB bound at Cys82 (18Steglich C. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Penno S. Hess W.R. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 7: 1611-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Adjacent to the cpeB gene, the putative S-type lyase CpeS is encoded. Besides CpeS, no other lyase homolog was identified in MED4. To study whether the putative lyase is sufficient for bilin attachment to β-PE, corresponding proteins were overproduced in E. coli and purified via affinity chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1). CpeS was obtained to almost 100% purity, CpeB to an estimated purity of <50%. Because CpeB was produced with an N-terminal NusA-tag, impurities most likely represent NusA breakdown products, which were removable by affinity purification of thrombin-cleaved CpeB. However, truncated CpeB was unstable and therefore only employed in small-scale control experiments to rule out an influence of either tag or contaminations on bilin binding assays. In addition, covalent binding of bilins to contaminating proteins was ruled out by zinc-blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S2). Prochlorococcus possesses the functional biosynthetic machinery for production of PEB and PCB (37Dammeyer T. Michaelsen K. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 271: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although PEB is the chromophore of β-PE, no PCB-binding protein has been identified in MED4 so far. Because members of the S/U type lyase family are characterized by a low bilin specificity (6Scheer H. Zhao K.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 68: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Kupka M. Zhang J. Fu W.L. Tu J.M. Böhm S. Su P. Chen Y. Zhou M. Scheer H. Zhao K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36405-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we tested CpeS for binding of all bilins synthesized by MED4. We included 3Z- and 3E-isomers of PCB and PEB to address the largely unstudied bilin stereoselectivity of lyases. Absorption spectra of BV IXα, 3E-PCB, and 3Z-PCB were only slightly influenced by CpeS (data not shown). Mixing of CpeS with DHBV, 3E-PEB, or 3Z-PEB immediately resulted in the formation of bluish, nonfluorescent complexes with increased long wavelength absorption at 607 nm (DHBV), 594 nm (3E-PEB), or 590 nm (3Z-PEB) (Fig. 1), indicating binding of bilins in a stretched conformation. During subsequent affinity purification of lyase-bilin mixtures, washing with increasing salt concentrations lead to release of total BV IXα, 3E-PCB, and 3Z-PCB at low salt concentrations (200 mm NaCl), whereas DHBV, 3E-PEB, and 3Z-PEB were retained, even at high salt concentrations (1 m NaCl) (data not shown). Absorption spectra of eluted complexes were comparable with those obtained before purification indicating stable binding of DHBV, 3E-PEB, and 3Z-PEB to CpeS. To investigate whether this stability is due to covalent binding, SDS-PAGE and subsequent zinc-blot analyses were performed (supplemental Fig. S2A). No zinc-induced red fluorescence was detected indicating a noncovalent interaction. S-type lyases can occur in different oligomeric states (38Saunée N.A. Williams S.R. Bryant D.A. Schluchter W.M. J.

Med. Biol. 2010; 675: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed size exclusion chromatography of CpeS in the presence and absence of bilins. In the absence of bilins, CpeS eluted as a complex of ∼47.1 kDa (Fig. 2A), which correlates well with the calculated mass of a homodimer (46.6 kDa). Elution profiles in the presence of bilins were almost identical with protein and bilin eluting simultaneously as CpeS·bilin complexes of ∼50.8 kDa (DHBV), 50.1 kDa (3E-PEB), and 50.3 kDa (3Z-PEB) (Fig. 2B). These data suggest CpeS dimer formation prior to bilin binding. Affinity purified CpeS·bilin complexes were denatured in acidic urea to determine the ratio of CpeS to bound bilin. According to the absorption in sodium phosphate buffer andacidic urea, protein to bilin ratios of 1:0.89 (3E-PEB), 1:0.84 (3Z-PEB), and 1:0.79 (DHBV) were calculated (data not shown) indicating dimeric CpeS with two bilins bound. Absorption spectra of denatured complexes were essentially the same as those of free bilins in the corresponding solvent and released bilins were identified by HPLC to be unmodified (supplemental Fig. S3). Extinction coefficients of CpeS·bilin complexes were determined per bilin as follows: ϵ594, 74,000 m−1 cm−1 (CpeS·3E-PEB); ϵ590 86,000 m−1 cm−1 (CpeS·3Z-PEB); and ϵ607, 87,800 m−1 cm−1 (CpeS·DHBV). As CpeS·bilin complexes were formed immediately after mixing, binding kinetics of both components were analyzed by stopped flow experiments. CpeS and bilins were rapidly mixed at different ratios and absorption increases at 594 nm (3E-PEB), 590 nm (3Z-PEB), or 607 nm (DHBV) were recorded. A single exponential function was fitted to the experimental data, from which the observed rate constant kobs was extracted (supplemental Fig. S4). The kobs values were plotted against the protein concentration (Fig. 3). Linear regression yielded the association rate constants kon as the slopes of the straight lines with standard errors in the range of 10%. 3E-PEB shows the fasted association rate constant (2 µm−1 s−1) followed by 3Z-PEB (1.4 µm−1 s−1) and DHBV (0.9 µm−1 s−1) (Table 1). However, kon values were in the same range especially when considering possible inexactness in DHBV or 3Z-PEB concentration due to the unknown extinction coefficients. The ordinate intercept values, which correspond to the dissociation rate constant koff, are close to 1 s−1. As this value is small, the standard error is of the same magnitude so that a precise value for koff cannot be obtained. Nevertheless, a value close to 1 s−1 can be confirmed by calculation from the kon value and the Kd value obtained from ITC (see below), which yields exactly Kd × kon = koff = 1.4 s−1.TABLE 1Rate constants and thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of CpeS with bilinsBilinkonKaKdkoffΔH0ΔS0µm−1 s−1× 106 m−1µms−1kcal/molcal/mol/degDHBV0.94 ± 0.04NDNDNDNDND3E-PEB1.96 ± 0.081.4 ± 0.50.7 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.4−6.1 ± 0.57.3 ± 1.33Z-PEB1.37 ± 0.12NDNDNDNDND Open table in a new tab CpeS·3E-PEB complex affinity was measured by ITC. 3Z-PEB and DHBV were not included due to insufficient amounts available. Experiments were repeated two times with an example of a result presented in Fig. 4, and mean values are shown in Table 1. The stoichiometry of CpeS·3E-PEB was n = 1.2 ± 0.04 in reasonable agreement with the spectroscopically determined 1:0.89 ratio in the complex. The resulting Kd value of the CpeS·3E-PEB complex was 0.7 µm, which represents tight binding and which is driven by both favorable enthalpy (ΔH0 = −6.1 ± 0.5 kcal/mol) as well as entropy (ΔS0 = 7.3 ± 1.3 cal/mol/deg) changes upon complex formation. The Kd determined for the CpeS·3E-PEB complex is in range with values obtained for other lyases (8Kupka M. Zhang J. Fu W.L. Tu J.M. Böhm S. Su P. Chen Y. Zhou M. Scheer H. Zhao K.H. J. Biol.

To verify whether CpeS is sufficient for correct bilin addition to β-PE, we compared spontaneous and lyase-mediated attachment of bilins to CpeB by recording the fluorescence emission of assembled holo-CpeB. DHBV was neither spontaneous nor under catalysis of CpeS attached to CpeB (Fig. 5, A and D). This was further verified by zinc-blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S2B) and HPLC of CpeB peptides (data not shown). Spontaneous and CpeS-mediated reactions of both PEB isomers with CpeB resulted in formation of fluorescent complexes with covalently bound bilins (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S2B). Reaction products were stronger fluorescent when obtained (i) with 3Z-PEB and (ii) in presence of CpeS. The course of spontaneous and lyase-supported reactions were significantly different. Whi"

In particular, the mutations identified in TM2 favor a model of KirBac channel gating in which opening of the pore at the helix-bundle crossing plays a far more important role than has recently been proposed. Inwardly rectifying (Kir) potassium channels are regulated by many different cellular factors such as G-proteins, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, ATP, and intracellular pH, and are therefore able to couple channel activity to a wide range of metabolic and physiological stimuli (1Bichet D. Haass F.A. Jan L.Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Hibino H. Inanobe A. Furutani K. Murakami S. Findlay I. Kurachi Y. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 291-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Their importance is illustrated by the fact that inherited mutations in Kir channels underlie a number of diseases including Type II Bartter syndrome (Kir1.1), Andersen syndrome (Kir2.1), SeSAME/EAST syndrome (Kir4.1), and vitreoretinal degeneration (Kir7.1), as well as certain forms of neonatal diabetes and hyperinsulinemia (Kir6.2) (2Hibino H. Inanobe A. Furutani K. Murakami S. Findlay I. Kurachi Y. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 291-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). The discovery of a large number of prokaryotic homologs of eukaryotic Kir channels (3Durell S.R. Guy H.R. BMC Evol. Biol. 2001; 1: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Sun S. Gan J.H.

Science. 2009; 326: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In particular, the ability to rapidly integrate data from functional, biochemical, and structural studies of KirBac channels represents a major advantage (8Cheng W.W. Enkvetchakul D. Nichols C.G. J.

However, in comparison with mammalian Kir channels, one of the current limitations is that we still know relatively little about the regulation of KirBac channel activity or their functional role in vivo. One approach to the study of prokaryotic K+ channel function has been to use K+-auxotrophic strains of Escherichia coli and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as an unbiased, high throughput screen for gating mutations (12Parfenova L.V. Rothberg B.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 337: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tang W. Ruknudin A. Yang W.P. Shaw S.Y. Knickerbocker A. Kurtz S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Several previous studies have successfully used this “forward genetics” approach to identify activatory mutations in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic potassium channels (12Parfenova L.V. Rothberg B.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 337: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yi B.A. Lin Y.F. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Channels. 2008; 2: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the assay is based upon the fact that K+ uptake is normally mediated by three principal transport pathways: kdp, trk, and kup, and several strains have been generated that have mutations in these genes. These strains are K+-auxotrophic and exhibit no growth in media containing low concentrations of K+ (<10 mm). However, this K+ uptake deficiency can be complemented by recombinant expression of a functional K+ channel that provides an alternative pathway for K+ entry (12Parfenova L.V. Rothberg B.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 337: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar). Similar K+-auxotrophic strains of S. cerevisiae have also been generated that have mutations in the trk1 and trk2 genes and can be used in exactly the same type of functional assays (13Tang W. Ruknudin A. Yang W.P. Shaw S.Y. Knickerbocker A. Kurtz S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used these K+ uptake-deficient strains to identify activatory mutations in KirBac1.1, KirBac3.1, KirBac4.1, and KirBac6.1. These mutations highlight the importance of several structurally conserved regions in KirBac channel gating, including residues close to the selectivity filter of KirBac3.1. However, the results also indicate a more important role for TM2 in KirBac channel gating than has recently been proposed (5Clarke O.B. Caputo A.T. Hill A.P. Vandenberg J.I. Smith B.J. Gulbis J.M. Cell. 2010; 141: 1018-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Finally we addressed the role of KirBac channels in vivo and demonstrate that deletion of the KirBac6.1 gene in its host organism (Synechocystis PCC6803) generates a K+-dependent growth deficiency consistent with a role for this channel in K+ uptake. Wild-type KirBac genes were cloned into the E. coli expression vector pQE60-lac as described previously (4Sun S. Gan J.H. Paynter J.J. Tucker S.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2006; 26: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For expression in yeast, the methionine-regulated pYES2m and p416 vectors were used with a modified Kozak sequence of 6 adenine nucleotides for optimal expression (AAAAAAATG) (19Hamilton R. Watanabe C.K. de Boer H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3581-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Randomly mutated libraries were constructed for KirBacs using the GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), which uses non-biased, error-prone PCR. The PCR reactions were quantified according to the manufacturer's protocols to produce an error rate of ∼1–3 mutations per open reading frame. PCR products were then subcloned back into their expression vectors. The primers used for amplification overlapped the 5′ and 3′ sequences of the open reading frames to prevent unwanted mutations in these regions. To maximize the transformation efficiency, ligations were purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation prior to transformation into Library Efficiency DH5α E. coli (Invitrogen) and growth in culture overnight. Analysis of the transformation efficiency prior to overnight growth indicated that the libraries contained at least 105 independent clones. Randomly selected independent clones were isolated on non-selective media, and upon sequencing, were found to contain an average of 2–5 mutations per open reading frame. All site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II system (Stratagene). All media, growth, and propagation of these strains are as described previously (4Sun S. Gan J.H. Paynter J.J. Tucker S.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2006; 26: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Irizarry S.N. Kutluay E. Drews G. Hart S.J. Heginbotham L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13653-13662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To screen the mutant libraries, 200 ng of mutant plasmid DNA was transformed into 100 μl of chemically competent TK2420 cells (1 × 106 cfu/μg) and plated out onto 90-mm Petri dishes containing K0 solid media supplemented to contain 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and (unless otherwise stated) 5 mm KCl. Plates were incubated at 37 °C (30 °C for KirBac3.1), individual colonies were picked and propagated in K115, and plasmid DNA was isolated. The quality of plasmid DNA obtained from the TK2420 strain is relatively low and was therefore retransformed back into DH5α and repurified prior to sequencing. To eliminate false positives, potential activatory mutants were retransformed into TK2420 and confirmed by drop tests on low [K+] before sequencing the entire gene. Drop tests and growth curves were done as described previously (4Sun S. Gan J.H. Paynter J.J. Tucker S.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2006; 26: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Paynter J.J. Sarkies P. Andres-Enguix I. Tucker S.J. Channels. 2008; 2: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight cultures were spun down, washed, and resuspended in an equal volume of K0, and then 4 μl of undiluted, 1:10, and 1:1000 dilutions was spotted onto the plates and allowed to dry before being grown overnight at 37 °C. For growth curves, washed overnight cultures were diluted 20-fold into K0 at the indicated KCl concentration, and growth was monitored by following A600 after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. All media, growth, and propagation of these strains are as described previously (16Minor Jr., D.L. Masseling S.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Channels. 2008; 2: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant KirBac channels were transformed into competent SGY1528 cells using a standard lithium acetate yeast transformation protocol. Transformants were grown on APKO-ura plates for ∼48 h before overnight growth in 4 ml of APKO-ura (100 mm KCl). Cultures were washed in APKO-met-ura media (0.5 mm KCl), and 3.5-μl drops of undiluted, 1:10, or 1:1000 dilutions were made onto APKO-met-ura plates (with [KCl] as specified). Drop test plates were incubated at 30 °C for ∼72 h. Wild-type and mutant KirBac1.1 proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (20Enkvetchakul D. Bhattacharyya J. Jeliazkova I.

For expression of KirBac3.1, we utilized a synthetic gene codon optimized for expression in E. coli (GenScript) and cloned into the pET30a vector (Novagen), with a C-terminal His6 tag. BL21 CodonPlus RP cells (Stratagene) were used for expression. The purification protocol was as described previously (21Kuo A. Domene C. Johnson L.N. Doyle D.A. Vénien-Bryan C. Structure. 2005; 13: 1463-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), with the following exceptions. Cells were grown at 19 °C overnight following induction, and the lysis buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl. Liposomal flux assays were performed as described previously (20Enkvetchakul D. Bhattacharyya J. Jeliazkova I. Groesbeck D.K. Cukras C.A. Nichols C.G. J. Biol.

Homology models and molecular dynamics (MD) 2The abbreviation used is: MDmolecular dynamics. simulations were done as has been described before (22Haider S. Khalid S. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. Sansom M.S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3643-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, a homology model of wild-type KirBac6.1 (residues 21–303) was built using Modeler 9v2 using KirBac3.1 crystal structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB): 1XL6) (5Clarke O.B. Caputo A.T. Hill A.P. Vandenberg J.I. Smith B.J. Gulbis J.M. Cell. 2010; 141: 1018-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) as a template. Sequence alignments were made using ClustalW2. The selectivity filter was populated with K+ ions at S0, S2, and S4 and interspersed with waters using crystal structure coordinates. The cavity was flooded using packages Voidoo and Flood. The model was inserted into an explicit, pre-equilibrated phosphatidylglycerol:palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol bilayer in water, and additional waters were added to accommodate the KirBac6.1 C terminus (box size = 10 × 10 × 12 nm). The protein was optimally positioned in the bilayer, clashing (<2 Å) lipids and waters were removed, and KCl concentration was adjusted to 100 mm. MD simulations were carried out using GROMACS v3.3.3 and GROMOS forcefield. Prior to simulation, energy minimization was carried out followed by incremental (5 ps, 10–20-K steps) warming from 80 to 310 K (37 °C) and a 50-ps equilibration step, both with lipid headgroups restrained. The MD run was 15.2 ns. molecular dynamics. Mutant models were created by introducing the mutation (either W48R or G137D) into all four subunits using PyMOL version 0.99 after energy minimization. Further energy minimization, warming, equilibration, and MD simulation used identical parameters to the WT model. Root mean squared deviation analysis showed all three models to be stable between 5 and 15.2 ns of simulation; only data from this period were used in other analyses. The open reading frame encoding the slr5078 (KirBac6.1) gene in Synechocystis PCC6803 was deleted by homologous recombination and replaced with a kanamycin resistance marker (23Hagemann M. Zuther E. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 429-434Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-kb genomic sequences on either side of the slr5078 gene were amplified by PCR and used to flank a kanamycin resistance gene. This targeting vector was then transformed into Synechocystis PCC6803 and selected using 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Successfully recombined colonies were identified by PCR and checked for integration of the kanamycin resistance cassette into every copy of the genome before growth in liquid medium. Logarithmically growing cultures were subcultured on alternate days (to 1 × 106 cells/ml) into liquid BG11 medium for a minimum of 7 days to standardize growth rates as described before (24Borrelly G.P. Rondet S.A. Tottey S. Robinson N.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For growth analysis, cells were inoculated to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml into acid-washed glass boiling tubes and monitored at 540 nm for 7 days. Growth was examined in standard BG11 growth media or in media supplemented with twice the media concentration of K2HPO4 (175 μm), NaNO3 (17.65 mm), MgSO4 (304 μm), or CaCl2 (245 μm). Growth was also monitored in the presence of twice the normal media concentration of manganese, zinc, copper, and molybdenum or chromium, nickel, and cobalt and in the presence of 175 μm Na2HPO4. Only the addition of K2HPO4 improved the growth of the cells. The assay was carried out in triplicate with independently selected deletion mutants and repeated on two further occasions. Mutants were also not subjected to culture conditions liable to select for second site mutations prior to growth. In a previous study, we demonstrated that wild-type KirBac4.1 fails to complement the growth of TK2420 E. coli and that this is not due to a toxic effect on cell growth (4Sun S. Gan J.H. Paynter J.J. Tucker S.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2006; 26: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that KirBac4.1 does not complement growth on low [K+] and is therefore suitable as a candidate gene to screen for activatory mutations. Wild-type KirBac6.1 does complement growth at 7.5 mm [K+], but not at lower concentrations, also making it a suitable candidate if screened on low [K+] media. KirBac3.1 also shows no complementation (Fig. 1A). By contrast, other KirBac channels, such as KirBac2.1, which exhibits robust complementation, or KirBac1.1, which exhibits toxic effects on the long term growth of E. coli, are unsuitable for screening in this assay (4Sun S. Gan J.H. Paynter J.J. Tucker S.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2006; 26: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We used an error-prone PCR method to create randomly mutated libraries for KirBac3.1, KirBac4.1, and KirBac6.1 and transformed these into TK2420 E. coli. For the KirBac4.1 library grown on 2.5 mm K+, ∼100 colonies were recovered, sequenced, and retransformed to ensure that they were not false positives (see under “Experimental Procedures”). In total, eight separate mutations were identified (Fig. 1B) where they rescue the growth of TK2420 in liquid media. They are also listed in Table 1. For KirBac6.1, we recovered 23 novel mutations, and for KirBac3.1, a total of 13 mutations were recovered (Table 1).TABLE 1Activatory mutations identified in the different KirBac channelsKirBac1.1KirBac3.1KirBac4.1KirBac6.1W60CI75SW41RP21LA109P/G134AA78PF113IR26GS136PF88LT123PW48RG143ET93IG124AL50FL144PG98DV204MS122CV145LL118QL205QI125MM121KG206DA133PG123DR252WL135IA125EG137DS129RL138SI150FM139LV181IF140YS205LV150LA172TN173KQ174LR178HS187TQ190KL209IR210CH212RT213IL218SR265LQ276R Open table in a new tab We next investigated the suitability of the SGY1528 K+-auxotrophic strain of S. cerevisiae for the identification of KirBac channel activatory mutations. KirBac1.1, KirBac3.1, KirBac4.1, and KirBac6.1 were subcloned into the pYES2m yeast expression vector and transformed into the SGY1528 strain. No complementation was observed for any of these wild-type channels on 2 mm [K+] (not shown), indicating that random mutagenesis could potentially identify activatory mutations. Mutant libraries for KirBac1.1, KirBac3.1, KirBac4.1, and KirBac6.1 were therefore created, transformed into SGY1528, and grown on 2 mm [K+]. No positive colonies were recovered from the KirBac3.1 and KirBac4.1 libraries. However, 52 clones were recovered and analyzed from the KirBac1.1 library, and ∼100 were recovered and analyzed from the KirBac6.1 library. After retransformation and separation of multiple mutations, a total of nine novel mutations were found in KirBac6.1, and a selection of these is shown in Fig. 2. A total of five novel mutations were identified in KirBac1.1 (Table 1) including one mutant (A109P/G134A) where both mutations are required. The activatory mutations shown in Table 1 are highlighted in an alignment of KirBac channels (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, a large number of activatory mutations are clustered in TM2 and were found in all of the KirBacs examined. In addition, mutations were found to cluster within the slide helix and at the base of TM1 near the helix-bundle crossing. Intriguingly, a number of activatory mutations were also found near the pore helix and selectivity filter, but only in KirBac3.1. The activatory mutations found in KirBac3.1 were mapped onto the available crystal structure and are illustrated in Fig. 3. The clustering of mutations within the C terminus is less apparent from this linear alignment but becomes clearer when mapped onto a structural model of a KirBac channel. For this purpose, we created a homology model of KirBac6.1 because the largest number of mutations was identified in this channel. Using this model we highlighted all of the mutations shown in Table 1, as well as some of the residues equivalent to those mutated in KirBac3.1 and KirBac4.1. Although these mutations are far apart in the linear sequence, mutations in the CD loop are close to several other clusters of mutations within the C terminus, in particular residues in adjacent loops (βF-βG loop) (see the supplemental movie). The clustering of mutations in TM2 is of particular interest as this helix has been shown to be critically important for K+ channel gating (1Bichet D. Haass F.A. Jan L.Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 25Cuello L.G. Jogini V. Cortes D.M. Pan A.C. Gagnon D.G. Dalmas O. Cordero-Morales J.F. Chakrapani S. Roux B. Perozo E. Nature. 2010; 466: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To determine whether the TM2 mutations we identified directly affect channel activity, we used KirBac1.1 and KirBac3.1 because both wild-type channels can be expressed and purified and are therefore suitable for liposomal flux assays (20Enkvetchakul D.

Johnson L.N. Doyle D.A. Vénien-Bryan C. Structure. 2005; 13: 1463-1472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The KirBac1.1 V145L mutation is located within the helix-bundle crossing of KirBac1.1 and is adjacent to the hydrophobic “blocking residue” Phe-146, which has been proposed to form the activation gate in KirBac1.1 (26Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). This mutant exhibited a dramatically faster rate of 86Rb+ uptake when compared with wild-type KirBac1.1 (Fig. 4A), thus indicating a direct effect on channel activity. Likewise the S129R mutation in TM2 of KirBac3.1 is located in a similar position (Fig. 3) and also showed a faster rate of 86Rb+ uptake when compared with wild-type KirBac3.1 (Fig. 4B). An additional gating mechanism has also been proposed to exist within the selectivity filter of KirBac3.1 (5Clarke O.B. Caputo A.T. Hill A.P. Vandenberg J.I. Smith B.J. Gulbis J.M. Cell. 2010; 141: 1018-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It was therefore intriguing that several activatory mutations were uncovered close to this region in KirBac3.1. The F88L mutation was of particular interest because this residue has previously been reported to undergo conformational changes during KirBac3.1 channel gating (11Gupta S. Bavro V.N. D'Mello R. Tucker S.J. Vénien-Bryan C. Chance M.R. Structure. 2010; 18: 839-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This side chain is located within the pore helix that precedes the selectivity filter (Fig. 3) and forms part of an intersubunit interface. The F88L mutation also exhibited a dramatically faster rate of 86Rb+ uptake when compared with wild-type KirBac3.1 (Fig. 4B). Using the homology model of KirBac6.1 created above, we examined the possible structural effect of two activatory mutations using MD simulations. Given the relatively short timescale of an atomistic MD simulation, we chose to examine activatory mutations likely to have the most biggest effect on channel structure. The W48R mutation located within the slide helix of KirBac6.1 was chosen due to the dramatic side-chain substitution involved, as well as the reported role of the slide helix in channel gating (27Enkvetchakul D. Jeliazkova I. Bhattacharyya J. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The homology model of wild-type KirBac6.1 was found to be stable during a 15-ns simulation (supplemental Fig. S2A). The W48R mutation was next introduced into the model, and a separate 15-ns MD simulation was run. Tryptophan 48 in the slide helix of wild-type KirBac6.1 is firmly embedded within the lipid bilayer. However, the W48R mutation introduces a positively charged residue at this position, and the MD simulation clearly shows that this mutation induces a rotation of the slide helix as the arginine moves away from the lipid environment to a more energetically favorable position (Fig. 5A). We next examined the effect of the G137D mutation in the MD simulation. Glycine 137 in KirBac6.1 is equivalent to the TM2 “lower glycine hinge” residue that is highly conserved in the KirBac/Kir channel superfamily (28Nagaoka Y. Shang L. Banerjee A. Bayley H. Tucker S.J. Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 29Shang L. Tucker S.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 2008; 37: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is also equivalent to Ser-129 in KirBac3.1, which is unique in possession of a serine at this position (supplemental Fig. S1) (4Sun S. Gan J.H. Paynter J.J. Tucker S.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2006; 26: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29Shang L. Tucker S.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 2008; 37: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Some previous studies have suggested that this position in TM2 may form a hinge point at the helix-bundle crossing. However, others have indicated that its small size is critical for the TM2 helices to come into close proximity at the helix-bundle crossing (28Nagaoka Y. Shang L. Banerjee A. Bayley H. Tucker S.J. Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 29Shang L. Tucker S.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 2008; 37: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Activatory mutations at this position were found in all four KirBacs tested, and in most cases, a charged amino acid was substituted at this position (Table 1). The MD simulation (Fig. 5, B and C) shows that introduction of a negatively charged aspartate residue at this position causes a significant widening of the pore at this constriction point. The bundle crossing opens to 2.3 Å ± 0.2 in KirBac6.1(G137D) when compared with 0.6 Å ± 0.1 in wild-type KirBac6.1 (supplemental Fig. S2B). Although it might be presumed that simple electrostatic repulsion between 4 aspartates in close proximity could be responsible for pushing these helices apart, the simulation clearly shows that the side chains are pointing away from the cavity and not into it. Further examination also shows that the aspartate side chain forms a hydrogen bond with a highly conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr-46) located within the slide helix (supplemental Fig. S4). In general, the functional role of microbial K+ channels is still poorly understood (30Kung C. Blount P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Kuo M.M. Haynes W.J. Loukin S.H. Kung C. Saimi Y. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 961-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to examine the phenotypic effects of deleting a KirBac channel in its host organism. KirBac6.1 was originally identified in the genome of the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803, a model photosynthetic organism that is readily amenable to genetic manipulation. We created a targeting vector that was used to replace the coding sequence of the KirBac6.1 gene (denoted slr5078 in the Synechocystis genome) with a kanamycin resistance cassette (see under “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fig. 5 shows that the ΔKirBac6.1 strain grows at a significantly slower rate than wild-type Synechocystis. Importantly, this growth defect could be partially reversed by growth in medium that contained twice the normal concentration of K2HPO4 (175 μm) in the medium (Fig. 6). As a control, supplementation with 175 μm Na2HPO4 was without effect on the growth rate, as was media supplemented with twice the standard concentration of NaNO3 (17.65 mm), MgSO4 (304 μm), or CaCl2 (245 μm) (not shown). Growth was also monitored in the presence of twice the normal media concentration of manganese, zinc, copper, and molybdenum or chromium, nickel, and cobalt and had no effect on growth of the mutant strain (not sho"

In addition, HO-2 is a redox-sensitive K/Ca2-associated protein, and BVR is an S/T/Y kinase. The two enzymes are components of cellular defense mechanisms. This is the first reporting of regulation of HO-2 by BVR and that their coordinated increase in isolated myocytes and intact heart protects against cardiotoxicity of β-adrenergic receptor activation by isoproterenol (ISO). The induction of BVR mRNA, protein, and activity and HO-2 protein was maintained for >96 h;increase in HO-1 was modest and transient. In isolated cardiomyocytes, experiments with cyclohex-imide, proteasome inhibitor MG-132, and siBVR suggested BVR-mediated stabilization of HO-2. In both models, activation of BVR offered protection against the ligand's stimulation of apoptosis. Two human BVR-based peptides known to inhibit and activate the reduc-tase, KKRILHC281 and KYCCSRK296, respectively, were tested in the intact heart. Perfusion of the heart with the inhibitory peptide blocked ISO-mediated BVR activation and augmented apoptosis; conversely, perfusion with the activating peptide inhibited apoptosis. At the functional level, peptide-mediated inhibition of BVR was accompanied by dysfunction of the left ventricle and decrease in HO-2 protein levels. Perfusion of the organ with the activating peptide preserved the left ventricular contractile function and was accompanied by increased levels of HO-2 protein. Finding that BVR and HO-2 levels, myocyte apoptosis, and contractile function of the heart can be modulated by small human BVR-based peptides offers a promising therapeutic approach for treatment of cardiac dysfunctions.—Ding, B., Gibbs, P.

https://openalex.org/W1999189368,"The rapid formation of numerous tissues during development is highly dependent on the swift activation of key developmental regulators. Recent studies indicate that many key regulatory genes are repressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), yet poised for rapid activation due to the presence of both activating (H3K4 trimethylation) and repressive (H3K27 trimethylation) histone modifications (bivalent genes). However, little is known about bivalent gene regulation. In this study, we investigated the regulation of the bivalent gene Sox21, which is activated rapidly when ESCs differentiate in response to increases in Sox2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that prior to differentiation, the Sox21 gene is bound by a complex array of repressive and activating transcriptional machinery. Upon activation, all identified repressive machinery and histone modifications associated with the gene are lost, but the activating modifications and tran-scriptional machinery are retained. Notably, these changes do not occur when ESCs differentiate in response to retinoic acid. Moreover, ESCs lacking a functional PRC2 complex fail to activate this gene, apparently due to its association with other repressive complexes. Together, these findings suggest that bivalent genes, such as Sox21, are silenced by a complex set of redundant repressive machinery, which exit rapidly in response to appropriate differentiation signals.—Chakravarthy, H., Ormsbee, B. D., Mallanna, S. K., Rizzino, A. Rapid activation of the bivalent gene Sox21 requires displacement of multiple layers of gene-silencing machinery. FASEB J. 25, 206–218 (2011). www.fasebj.org"
https://openalex.org/W2111900761,"Ca2+ release through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R) can be modulated by numerous factors, including input from other signal transduction cascades. These events shape the spatio-temporal characteristics of the Ca2+ signal and provide fidelity essential for the appropriate activation of effectors. In this study, we investigate the regulation of Ca2+ release via InsP3R following activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases in the presence and absence of expression of a binding partner InsP3R-associated cGMP kinase substrate (IRAG). cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) phosphorylation of only the S2+ InsP3R-1 subtype resulted in enhanced Ca2+ release in the absence of IRAG expression. In contrast, IRAG bound to each InsP3R subtype, and phosphorylation of IRAG by PKG attenuated Ca2+ release through all InsP3R subtypes. Surprisingly, simply the expression of IRAG attenuated phosphorylation and inhibited the enhanced Ca2+ release through InsP3R-1 following cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activation. In contrast, IRAG expression did not influence the PKA-enhanced activity of the InsP3R-2. Phosphorylation of IRAG resulted in reduced Ca2+ release through all InsP3R subtypes during concurrent activation of PKA and PKG, indicating that IRAG modulation is dominant under these conditions.

These studies yield mechanistic insight into how cells with various complements of proteins integrate and prioritize signals from ubiquitous signaling pathways. Cells express an array of cell surface receptors that couple neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors to cellular responses. In vivo, cells are seldom exposed to single modulating agents, and thus initiation of multiple signal transduction pathways concurrently is the norm. As a result of interaction between individual signal transduction cascades, one pathway can markedly influence the activity of another; the overall cellular response will therefore be determined by the integration and prioritization of these multiple inputs. Cell surface receptors coupled to a release of intracellular Ca2+ are expressed in all mammalian cells, and this pathway is a particularly rich source of potential interaction between distinct signal transduction systems (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4065) Google Scholar, 2Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 437-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ rise can initiate further signaling cascades, for instance by influencing the generation and metabolism of other second messengers, including cAMP and cGMP (3Conti M. Beavo J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 4Willoughby D. Cooper D.M. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 965-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Importantly, the precise kinetic and spatial properties of the Ca2+ signal are pivotal to the appropriate stimulation of effectors, and thus regulatory input modulating the activity of the Ca2+ handling machinery itself is central to the spatio-temporal “shaping” of the Ca2+ signal (5Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar).

InsP3R are encoded by three genes, leading to the expression of three distinct proteins (InsP3R-1, InsP3R-2, and InsP3R-3) (6Blondel O. Takeda J. Janssen H. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol.

Additional diversity at the protein level is generated from numerous splice variants of the InsP3R-1 and InsP3R-2 and the formation of heterotetrameric channel proteins (9Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release is allosterically regulated by a diverse array of modulatory events allowing input from other intracellular factors or events. These include the levels of intracellular Ca2+, ATP levels, phosphorylation events, and binding of protein partners (2Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev.

Outside of the conserved NH2-terminal InsP3 binding pocket and the COOH-terminal channel domain, the primary sequence of the individual proteins is quite divergent, allowing for potential InsP3R subtype-specific regulation of Ca2+ release. This regulation, along with the particular complement of InsP3R expressed, is thought to make a significant contribution to defining the particular Ca2+ signals observed in individual cell types. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor(s) inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate InsP3R-associated cGMP kinase substrate carbachol human muscarinic M3R protein kinase A cGMP-dependent kinase(s) 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d- ribofuranosylbenzylimadazole-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate 8-bromo-β-phenyl-1,N2-ethenoguanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate 8-bromo-β-phenyl-1,N2-ethenoguanosine- 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer.

Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The increased InsP3R activity has been proposed to be physiologically important for processes as diverse as neuronal plasticity and fluid secretion from salivary epithelia (15Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z.

PKG can be activated following ligand binding of receptors with intrinsic guanylate cyclase activity or as a consequence of the action of nitric oxide on soluble guanylate cyclases (19Hofmann F. Bernhard D. Lukowski R. Weinmeister P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 191: 137-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). An elevation in cAMP can also lead to PKG activation either directly or indirectly by increasing cGMP levels through substrate competition at the level of shared phosphodiesterases. When the functional effects on InsP3R-1 were studied directly, PKG phosphorylation of identical sites regulated by PKA resulted, as expected, in a marked enhancement of the neuronal S2+ InsP3R-1 activity (20Wagner 2nd, L.E.

The alternatively spliced S2− InsP3R-1 variant, the major InsP3R-1 splice variant expressed outside the neural system, resulting in 40 amino acids excised between phosphorylation sites, was not subject to regulation by PKG (20Wagner 2nd, L.E.

These data indicate that all PKA consensus sequences are not necessarily PKG substrates. No data are available regarding direct effects of PKG on InsP3R-2 and InsP3R-3. Elevations in cGMP have, however, been predominantly linked to an attenuation of Ca2+ signaling (21Cavallini L. Coassin M. Borean A. Alexandre A. J. Biol.

For example, PKG can also influence the activity of InsP3R by phosphorylation of a binding partner termed InsP3R-associated PKG substrate (IRAG) (25Antl M. von Brühl M.L. Eiglsperger C. Werner M.

This protein constitutively binds to both InsP3R-1 and PKG1β, and the tight association between proteins allows for efficient targeted phosphoregulation. In smooth muscle and platelets, IRAG is phosphorylated on serine 696 and leads to decreased InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (27Ammendola A. Geiselhöringer A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although it is not known if IRAG interacts with all subtypes of InsP3R or if its expression is ubiquitous, this mechanism may reconcile earlier observations of decreased Ca2+ release following PKG and PKA activation in various tissues (22Komalavilas P.

The goal of the present study was to further investigate the regulation of Ca2+ release by PKA and PKG. By using an expression system that is functionally null for both InsP3R and IRAG, we define the particular InsP3R that are subject to direct regulation by PKG and indirect regulation by interaction through IRAG. Furthermore, because PKG and PKA are commonly activated concurrently, we define the conditions and the molecular mechanism by which a particular mode of regulation is specified and is dominant at the cellular level.

Briefly, DT40 cells were loaded with 2 µm fura-2/AM at room temperature for 10 min. Fura-2-loaded cells were allowed to adhere to a glass coverslip forming the bottom of a perfusion chamber. Cells were perfused in HEPES-buffered physiological saline containing 137 mm NaCl, 0.56 mm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, and 1.26 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.4.

Fura-2-loaded cells were excited alternately with light at 340 and 380 nm by using a monochrometer-based illumination system (TILL Photonics), and the emission at 510 nm was captured by a digital frame transfer CCD camera controlled by the Vision suite of software. In experiments where GFP-tagged IRAG (IRAG(GFP)) or IRAGΔE12 (IRAGΔE12(GFP)) was transiently expressed, GFP fluorescence was detected by excitation at 488 nm and monitoring the emission at >500 nm and was used to select transfected cells.

Because the binding determinants of IRAG in InsP3R-1 are not known, the likelihood of an interaction with other InsP3R subtypes is difficult to predict. In order to establish if IRAG can potentially modulate other InsP3R family members and splice variants, experiments were first performed to ascertain whether IRAG physically interacts with all subtypes of InsP3R and is capable of forming a tertiary complex with PKG1β. COS-7 cells were chosen for these experiments because of the ability to achieve high levels of heterologous protein expression together with low endogenous InsP3R expression (12Betzenhauser M.J.

Following transfection with InsP3R subtypes, GFP-tagged IRAG and PKG1β immune complexes were isolated from cell lysates by incubation with α-GFP antisera as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Similar experiments were performed in cells transfected with a GFP-IRAG construct (IRAGΔE12(GFP)), which lacks the coiled-coil domain of IRAG necessary for interaction with InsP3R-1 (27Ammendola A.

In Fig. 1A, a representative blot is presented, which shows that immunoprecipitation with α-GFP antibody captures both S2+ and S2− InsP3R-1 and PKG1β when full-length IRAG(GFP) is co-expressed (lanes 5 and 7, respectively). In contrast, in cells expressing IRAGΔE12(GFP), PKG1β but not InsP3R-1 was recovered from the lysates following IP (lanes 6 and 8). Similar experiments were performed to determine if InsP3R-2 and InsP3R-3 interact in an analogous fashion with IRAG and PKG1β. The lower panels of Fig. 1 demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of full-length IRAG(GFP) robustly captures InsP3R-2 (Fig. 1B) or InsP3R-3 (Fig. 1C) and PKG1β, whereas immunoprecipitation of IRAGΔE12(GFP) does not. Next, experiments were performed to determine if the interaction of IRAG/PKG1β with individual InsP3R subtypes modulates Ca2+ release. By virtue of targeted deletion of both copies of the three chicken InsP3R genes, the DT40-3KO pre-B lymphocyte cell line is a unique experimental platform to monitor the function of defined populations of mammalian InsP3R in an unambiguously null background (35Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have generated stable cell lines expressing individual mammalian InsP3R splice variants and subtypes (29Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K.

To monitor the effects of PKG activation on Ca2+ release, these lines were transfected with muscarinic M3 receptor (M3R), together with IRAG constructs and PKG1β. Ca2+ release was monitored in fura-2-loaded cells following stimulation of M3R with low concentrations of CCh. This paradigm has been shown to be a convenient and relatively faithful reflection of Ca2+ release, given that little desensitization of the response is observed over multiple exposures to agonist, and the initial peak height is largely independent of Ca2+ influx (16Wagner 2nd, L.E. Joseph S.K. Yule D.I. J Physiol. 2008; 586: 3577-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Wagner 2nd, L.E. Li W.H. Joseph S.K. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46242-46252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Initially, experiments were performed with DT40-3KO cells stably expressing the S2− peripheral splice variant of InsP3R-1 and transiently expressing M3R, IRAG(GFP), and PKG1β. Ca2+ release was initiated by brief exposure to a low concentration of CCh, and following agonist washout, the cells were incubated for 5 min with the cell-permeable and phosphodiesterase-resistant cGMP analog PET-cGMP and subsequently restimulated with CCh. As shown in Fig. 2A (pooled data in Fig. 2C), activation of PKG resulted in a marked inhibition of the CCh-induced Ca2+ signal, which was partially reversible upon removal of the cGMP analog. The inhibition of Ca2+ release was dependent on both the expression of PKG1β and IRAG because failing to express either protein abrogated the response (Fig. 2C). The current experiments are consistent with our earlier data, which suggested that S2− InsP3R-1 are not a direct substrate for PKG (20Wagner 2nd, L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45811-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31Wagner 2nd, L.E. Li W.H. Joseph S.K. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46242-46252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inhibition was dependent on the interaction between IRAG and S2- InsP3R-1 because no attenuation of the CCh-induced Ca2+ signal following PET-cGMP exposure was observed in cells expressing IRAGΔE12(GFP) (Fig. 2B). These data indicate the importance of the InsP3R-1·IRAG·PKG1β complex and that DT40-3KO cells are functionally null for IRAG and PKG1β in the absence of ectopic expression. Similar experiments were performed in cells stably expressing the S2+ neuronal InsP3R-1 splice variant. PET-cGMP treatment of cells transiently expressing M3R, IRAG(GFP), and PKG1β resulted in a marked inhibition of the CCh-induced Ca2+ rise (Fig. 3, A and pooled data in D). Again, the attenuation of Ca2+ release was dependent on the expression of PKG1β and binding of IRAG to the InsP3R-1 (Fig. 3, B and D). In contrast, in the absence of IRAG, PET-cGMP incubation led to a striking enhancement of the CCh-induced Ca2+ signal (Fig. 3, C and pooled data in E), presumably as a result of the fact that S2+ InsP3R-1 is a direct substrate for PKG and phosphorylation of Ser1755 of S2+ InsP3R results in a marked increase in the open probability of the receptor (16Wagner 2nd, L.E. Joseph S.K. Yule D.I. J Physiol. 2008; 586: 3577-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A small but statistically significant increase in Ca2+ release was also observed in cells expressing IRAGΔE12(GFP) and PKG1β (Fig. 3, B and D). This observation is also consistent with direct phosphorylation of S2+ InsP3R-1; however, the finding that this effect is smaller than observed in the absence of IRAG may reflect the fact that IRAGΔE12(GFP) retains PKG1β binding (27Ammendola A. Geiselhöringer A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and thus may sequester a fraction of the kinase from other substrates. The data in Fig. 3A also suggest that the inhibitory effect of phosphorylation of IRAG is dominant over any positive effect of direct phosphorylation of S2+ InsP3R-1. Next, experiments addressed whether binding of IRAG to InsP3R-2 and InsP3R-3 is translated into modulation of Ca2+ release through these particular receptors. Cells stably expressing mouse InsP3R-2 were transfected with M3R, PKG1β, and IRAG(GFP). Exposure of these cells to PET-cGMP resulted in a considerable attenuation of the CCh-induced Ca2+ signal, which again was fully reversible upon removal of the cGMP analog (Fig. 4, A and pooled data in D). This effect was dependent on PKG activity because the extent of inhibition was significantly reduced by concurrent exposure to the PKG inhibitor Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP (F"
https://openalex.org/W2054422287,"Leptin, the product of the ob gene, plays important roles in the regulation of food intake and body weight through its receptor in the hypothalamus. To identify novel transcripts induced by leptin, we performed cDNA subtraction based on selective suppression of the polymerase chain reaction by using mRNA prepared from the forebrain of leptin-injected ob/ob mice. One of the genes isolated was a mouse homolog of human negative regulatory element-binding protein (NREBP). Its expression was markedly increased by leptin in the growth hormone secretagogue-receptor (GHS-R)-positive neurons of the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The promoter region of GHS-R contains one NREBP binding sequence, suggesting that NREBP regulates GHS-R transcription. Luciferase reporter assays showed that NREBP repressed GHS-R promoter activity in a hypothalamic neuronal cell line, GT1-7, and its repressive activity was abolished by the replacement of negative regulatory element in GHS-R promoter. Overexpression of NREBP reduced the protein expression of endogenous GHS-R without affecting the expression of ob-Rb in GT1-7 cells. To determine the functional importance of NREBP in the hypothalamus, we assessed the effects of NREBP on ghrelin action. Although phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) was induced by ghrelin in GT1-7 cells, NREBP repressed ghrelin-induced AMPKα phosphorylation. These results suggest that leptin-induced NREBP is an important regulator of GHS-R expression in the hypothalamus and provides a novel molecular link between leptin and ghrelin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1988695766,"Two novel regulatory motifs, LDEVFL and C-terminal regulatory Glu (E)-rich motif (CREEM), are identified in the extreme C terminus of the ABC protein DrrA, which is involved in direct interaction with the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the membrane protein DrrB and in homodimerization of DrrA. Disulfide cross-linking analysis showed that the CREEM and the region immediately upstream of CREEM participate directly in forming an interaction interface with the N terminus of DrrB. A series of mutations created in the LDEVFL and CREEM motifs drastically affected overall function of the DrrAB transporter. Mutations in the LDEVFL motif also significantly impaired interaction between the C terminus of DrrA and the N terminus of DrrB as well as the ability of DrrA and DrrB to co-purify, therefore suggesting that the LDEVFL motif regulates CREEM-mediated interaction between DrrA and DrrB and plays a key role in biogenesis of the DrrAB complex. Modeling analysis indicated that the LDEVFL motif is critical for conformational integrity of the C-terminal domain of DrrA and confirmed that the C terminus of DrrA forms an independent domain. This is the first report which describes the presence of an assembly domain in an ABC protein and uncovers a novel mechanism whereby the ABC component facilitates the assembly of the membrane component. Homology sequence comparisons showed the presence of the LDEVFL and CREEM motifs in close prokaryotic and eukaryotic homologs of DrrA, suggesting that these motifs may play a similar role in other homologous drug and lipid export systems."
https://openalex.org/W2086401795,"The prototypic chromatin insulator cHS4 has proven effective in reducing silencing chromosomal position effects in a variety of settings. Most of this barrier insulator activity has been mapped to a 250-bp core region, as well as to several proteins that bind this region. However, recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated that an extended 400-bp core region of the cHS4 element is necessary to achieve full barrier insulator activity when used as a single copy in the context of recombinant gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors. In this study, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays revealed specific DNA-protein binding activities associated with the distal portion of this extended core region. Affinity purification and tandem mass spectrometry studies led to the identification of one of these proteins as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). The identity of this binding activity as PARP-1 was subsequently verified by a variety of biochemical studies in vitro and by chromatin immunoprecipitation studies in vivo. Functional studies with gammaretroviral reporter vectors in cell lines and primary mouse bone marrow progenitor cultures showed that cHS4 barrier activity was abrogated upon mutation of the putative PARP-1-binding site or upon treatment with a PARP inhibitor, respectively. The barrier activity of the cHS4 element was also found to be abrogated in studies using bone marrow from Parp1-null mice.

Recent advances in the analysis of global patterns of gene regulation and genomic architecture have led in part to a greater appreciation for the role of a class of cis-regulatory elements known as chromatin insulators. Chromatin insulators are DNA elements that help form functional boundaries between adjacent chromatin domains (as reviewed Refs. 1West A.G. Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 2Emery D.W. Aker M. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Makrides S.C. Gene Transfer and Expression in Mammalian Cells.

They have been reported in species as diverse as yeast and man and have been shown to play a key role in global gene regulation. There are two basic classes of chromatin insulators: enhancer-blocking insulators and barrier insulators. Enhancer-blocking insulators prevent enhancer-mediated transcriptional activation of adjacent promoters, whereas barrier insulators block the encroachment of silencing heterochromatin into adjoining regions of open chromatin that are otherwise transcriptionally permissive. The elements that mediate these activities are physically separable and mechanistically distinct, although they are sometimes found in close proximity. Of the insulator elements identified to date, most are of the enhancer-blocking variety. In vertebrates, the function of these elements is mediated through the zinc finger DNA-binding protein CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) 2The abbreviations used are: CTCFCCCTC-binding factorPARP-1poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1ssDNAsingle-stranded DNALTRlong terminal repeat3-AB3-aminobenzamidedsDNAdouble-stranded DNAm.f.u.mean fluorescence unitsPARylatedpoly(ADP-ribosyl)ated.

In general, these elements are thought to function through physical interactions between adjacent insulator elements or through CTCF-mediated tethering of the chromatin fiber to structural elements within the nucleus (5Yusufzai T.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8620-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Fewer barrier insulators have been reported in the literature, and less is known about the mechanisms underlying their function. In the context of higher eukaryotes, these elements appear to function through the formation of constitutionally “open” chromatin regions with histone modifications that block the self-perpetuating spread of heterochromatin (as reviewed in Ref. 3Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). CCCTC-binding factor poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 single-stranded DNA long terminal repeat 3-aminobenzamide double-stranded DNA mean fluorescence units poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated. Much of what is known about the structure and function of vertebrate chromatin insulators comes from studies of cHS4 (chicken β-globin locus control region DNase-hypersensitive site 4). This prototypic chromatin insulator exhibits separable enhancer-blocking and barrier insulator activities in a variety of settings (6Recillas-Targa F. Pikaart M.J. Burgess-Beusse B. Bell A.C. Litt M.D. West A.G. Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6883-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Most of both activities were initially mapped to a 250-bp fragment containing the dominant DNase-hypersensitive site (6Recillas-Targa F. Pikaart M.J. Burgess-Beusse B. Bell A.C. Litt M.D. West A.G. Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6883-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7Chung J.H. Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), although full activity requires the use of multiple copies of this core. Subsequent deletion, footprinting, biochemical, and functional studies identified five DNA-binding components of this fragment (as reviewed in Ref. 3Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). One site (FII) is bound by CTCF and is both necessary and sufficient for enhancer blocking (8Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Another site (FIV) is bound by the proteins USF1 and USF2 and plays an important role in cHS4 barrier activity (9West A.G. Huang S. Gaszner M. Litt M.D. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Huang S. Li X. Yusufzai T.M. Qiu Y. Felsenfeld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 7991-8002Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These proteins serve to recruit histone-modifying enzymes that create a peak of hyperacetylated histone 3 Lys9. This competes in turn with methylation of this moiety, a modification that is involved in heterochromatin protein 1 recruitment and heterochromatin progression (as reviewed in Ref. 3Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Three other sites of the 250-bp cHS4 core involved in barrier activity are bound by Vezf1/BGP1, a protein that regulates genomic DNA methylation through its effects on DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3b (11Gowher H. Stuhlmann H. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2075-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Unlike more conventional cis-regulatory elements, chromatin insulators do not exhibit inherent transcriptional enhancing or repressing activities on their own. This property, combined with the ability of insulators such as cHS4 to effectively block both enhancers and silencing heterochromatin, has led several groups to investigate the use of chromatin insulators for improving the expression and safety of recombinant retroviral vectors commonly used in gene therapy applications (see Refs. 12Aker M. Tubb J. Groth A.C. Bukovsky A.A. Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Kiem H.P. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Emery D.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 2007; 18: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar and 13Li C.L. Xiong D. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Emery D.W. Mol. Ther. 2009; 17: 716-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and references therein). Much of this work has focused on the use of the cHS4 insulator to reduce the silencing of such vectors by chromosomal position effects. While seeking to define the minimum sequences necessary for this activity, we found that flanking a gammaretroviral vector with a single copy of the 250-bp cHS4 core is ineffective in preventing transgene silencing. In contrast, a 400-bp fragment containing the 250-bp core plus 3′-flanking sequence protects vector expression to the same degree as the 1.2-kb fragment used to initially characterize the cHS4 insulator in this setting (12Aker M. Tubb J. Groth A.C. Bukovsky A.A. Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Kiem H.P. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Emery D.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 2007; 18: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We report here studies that identify a DNA-binding activity associated with this extended core region as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). We also provide functional evidence that PARP-1 plays a direct role in the barrier insulator activity of this extended core region. The protein PARP-1 has been physically associated with the activity of enhancer-blocking insulators in a variety of settings and has been shown to modify CTCF. However, this is the first functional demonstration of a role for PARP-1 in the insulating activity of cHS4 and the first demonstration of a role for PARP-1 in the barrier activity of any insulator. Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by EMSAs based on previously described methods (14Song C.Z. Keller K. Chen Y. Stamatoyannopoulos G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Specifically, nuclear extracts were prepared by washing subconfluent cells in cold PBS and resuspending cells in hypotonic lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P8340), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm PMSF. Nuclear pellets were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in low salt buffer (hypotonic lysis buffer except with 20 mm KCl and 0.2 mm EDTA) to one-half of the packed nuclear volume. An equal volume of high salt buffer (same as low salt buffer except with 1.2 m KCl) was added dropwise, and after 30 min on ice, the preparation was again centrifuged to obtain cleared nuclear lysate, which was stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically with Bradford reagent. Oligonucleotide probes (50 pmol) were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then purified over Sephadex G-50 columns. Probes were incubated with 10 µg of nuclear extract at room temperature for 30–40 min in EMSA buffer consisting of 8 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 12% glycerol, 160 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2% polyvinyl alcohol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.05% IGEPAL CA-630 and then separated on 4% acrylamide and 2.5% glycerol nondenaturing gels in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. Gels were imaged using a PhosphorImager. Complementary probes (50 µm) were annealed by denaturing and slowly cooling in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl. Probes for FVI, FVII, and FVIII consisted of 56-bp oligonucleotides spanning the region between the HindIII site that defines the 3′-boarder of the 250-bp cHS4 core and the SbfI restriction site that defines the 3′-boarder of the extended 400-bp cHS4 core. Competitors included poly(dI-dC), salmon sperm genomic DNA, unlabeled cHS4 FVIII oligonucleotides, biotin-conjugated cHS4 FVIII oligonucleotides, unlabeled cHS4 FII oligonucleotides, and oligonucleotides spanning the PARP-1-binding site in the promoter of the EEF1A1 gene (15Nordhoff E.

Sequences for all probe and competitor oligonucleotides are provided in Table 1. Nuclear extract was either replaced with purified PARP-1 protein (Trevigen 4668-100-01) or supershifted by the addition of an anti-PARP-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7150).TABLE 1Sequence of probes, competitors, and mutant FVIII elementsSequencesOligonucleotides used for EMSA (only one strand shown) FVI probe (56 nucleotides)5′-AAGCTTTAGGCTGAAAGAGAGATTTAGATTGACAGAATCATAGAACGGCCTGGGTT FVII probe (56 nucleotides)5′-GCAAAGGAGCACAGTGCTCATCCAGATCCAACCCCCTGCTCTGTGCAGGGTCATCA FVIII probe (56 nucleotides)5′-ACCAGCAGCCCAGGCTGCCCAGAGCCACATCCAGCCTGGCCTTGAATGCCTGCAGG FII competitor (30 nucleotides)5′-GTAATTACGTCCCTCCCCCGCTAGGGGGC PARP-1-binding site in the EEF1A1 gene promoter (26 nucleotides)5′-GTGTACTGGCTCCGCCTTTTTCCCGAOligonucleotides used for real-time PCR/ChIP FVIIIForward5′-GTGCAGGGTCATCAACCAGCAReverse5′-ACACTGAGACAGGGGAGGTTT HSP70Forward5′-GGCGAAACCCCTGGAATATTCCCGAReverse5′-AGCCTTGGGACAACGGGAG SEMA4GForward5′-CCACGCCAGTCTGTATTGCAReverse5′-TACAGCCTTCTGCACAGACAT ACTBForward5′-AGAGCTACGAGCTGCCTGACReverse5′-AAGGTAGTTTCGTGGATGCCOligonucleotides used for PCR typing of mouse progenitor colonies GFPForward5′-TCGTGACCACCCTGACCTAGReverse5′-GGTCTTGTAGTTGCCGTCGTMutated FVIII sequences used in ChIP and K562 cell transduction studies FVIIIScrambled (32 nucleotides, underlined portion only)5′-ACCAGCAGGCGGCCGCACGTCATCGCAGCGATGGAGGCTATTGAATGCCTGCAGGDeleted (deleted portion underlined)5′-ACCAGCAGCCCAGGCTGCCCAGAGCCACATCCAGCCTGGCCTTGAATGCCTGCAGG Open table in a new tab Biotinylated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotide probes for FVIII and a nonspecific poly(T) oligonucleotide probe were bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's directions. They were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with nuclear extracts from K562 cells, along with poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor. The samples were subsequently washed progressively with 100–350 mm NaCl and boiled in SDS reducing buffer to release the remaining bound proteins. The samples eluted by boiling were size-fractionated on 4–15% gradient denaturing gels (Bio-Rad). Specific bands were excised, washed with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (3×), dehydrated in acetonitrile (3×), dried under vacuum, and resuspended in sequencing-grade trypsin on ice for 45 min. Tryptic fragments were then extracted with 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA and analyzed on a tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo linear trap quadrupole Orbitrap LTQ-OT MS/MS mass spectrometer, Thermo Electron Corp.). Peptide sequences were identified using ProteinProphet software. The gradient gel was soaked in transfer buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol and transferred to PVDF membrane overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was blocked with Starting Block (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and hybridized with an anti-PARP-1 antibody (Chemicon AB3565), followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce). The membrane was developed with the SuperSignal West detection kit (Pierce) and imaged on film. The gammaretroviral reporter vectors MGPN2 and INS4(+) have been described previously (16Emery D.W. Yannaki E. Tubb J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9150-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and are diagrammed in Fig. 1A. The MGPN2-based vector containing the 400-bp cHS4 core in the 3′-long terminal repeat (LTR) has also been described previously (12Aker M. Tubb J. Groth A.C. Bukovsky A.A. Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Kiem H.P. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Emery D.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 2007; 18: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The PARP-1-binding site was removed by Bal31 digestion, generating a 92-bp deletion starting at 122 bp 3′ of the HindIII site used to define the 3′-boundary of the 250-bp cHS4 core. A 32-bp segment starting at nucleotide 9 of the FVIII probe diagrammed in Fig. 2 and spanning the PARP-1-binding site was replaced with a “scrambled” sequence with similar GC content (see Table 1 for sequence details). Retroviral vector producer lines were generated using the amphotropic packaging line PA317 and the ecotropic packaging line GP+E86 as described (12Aker M. Tubb J. Groth A.C. Bukovsky A.A. Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Kiem H.P. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Emery D.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 2007; 18: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.FIGURE 2Physical properties of FVIII probes. A, predicted secondary structure for ssDNA FVIII probes. The sequence of the ssDNA FVIII (+)-strand probe was predicted to have the thermodynamically favorable structure diagrammed (Mfold Quickfold program (21Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10242) Google Scholar); ΔG = −8.2, Tm = 70 °C). Note that a similar structure was also predicted for the ssDNA FVIII (−)-strand probe (ΔG = −12.2, Tm = 90 °C; B). B, hypothesized cruciform secondary structure for the dsDNA FVIII probe. Note that the stem structures for both strands share identical primary sequences. C, confirmation of the cruciform for dsDNA FVIII. The bacterial plasmid encoding the gammaretroviral vector INS4(+) was digested with KpnI, and the resulting mixture containing 4.7- and 3.7-kb fragments was further digested with increasing amounts of nuclease S1. This included 3-fold dilutions starting at 4 units/µl nuclease S1 and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were then separated on a 1% agarose gel, Southern-blotted, hybridized with a probe for the 3′-end of the cHS4 core as indicated, and imaged using a PhosphorImager. Left panel, gel stained with EtBr before blotting. Note that both bands were eventually degraded with increasing amount of nuclease S1 but that the top band appeared to generate a faint but specific smaller band. Right panel, Southern blot confirming the identity of the specific nuclease S1-digested band. Note the appearance of this band at the size expected for digestion at FVIII. Quantification indicated that this lower band represents ∼20% of the signal from the higher intact band (two lower nuclease S1 concentrations). Pg, phosphoglycerate kinase promoter; K, sample digested with KpnI only. D, confirmation of complex secondary structure for the dsDNA FVIII probe. Nuclease S1 studies were also carried out using dsDNA probes for FVI, FVII, and FVIII, essentially as described for C with a 4% agarose gel and EtBr staining. Note that the FVIII probe was degraded at a 3-fold lower concentration of nuclease S1 than the other probes. Also notice that all three dsDNA probes, including the probe for FVIII, existed as a single product prior to further manipulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were plasmid-transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's directions and plated at limiting dilution under G418 selection. After selection, individual colonies were picked under an inverted microscope and expanded for ChIP studies. Human erythroleukemia K562 cells were transduced by 24 h of culture with virus supernatant and 4 µg/ml Polybrene at a limiting multiplicity of infection (<1 infectious unit/cell) to assure low vector copy numbers. The cells were then washed and plated at limiting dilution in 96-well dishes under G418 selection. After selection, individual colonies were isolated and expanded for expression analysis. Mouse bone marrow cells were transduced by co-cultivation on vector producer cells as described previously (16Emery D.W. Yannaki E. Tubb J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9150-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and included the following strains: wild-type B6xD2 F1 and Parp1-deficient 129S-Parp1tm1Zqw/J (Parp1−/−; Jackson Laboratory 002779) (17Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Vector GFP expression was analyzed directly on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software. The percentage of GFP-positive cells in the experimental samples was determined by subtracting the amount of background signal within the established gate (typically set at 1%) of mock-transduced cells. The GFP mean fluorescence in the experimental samples was determined by subtracting the background mean fluorescence of mock-transduced cells. Cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde, and chromatin was prepared and sheared as described (18Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). ChIP analysis was performed on two to six biological replicates using the previously described microplate-based Matrix ChIP method (19Flanagin S. Nelson J.D. Castner D.G. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Antibodies included anti-PARP-1 (Chemicon AB3565) and anti-histone H3 (Abcam ab1791). The level of target template in precipitated and input samples was determined in triplicate by real-time PCR as described (19Flanagin S. Nelson J.D. Castner D.G. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: e17Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Target templates included FVIII, the exon 2–3 region of the gene encoding β-actin (ACTB), and promoters of the negative control SEMA4G and positive control HSP70.1. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. Transduced marrow cells were plated at 1–2 × 104 cells/ml in medium containing 1% methylcellulose, 15% fetal bovine serum, and multiple growth factors, including interleukin-3, interleukin-6, stem cell factor, and erythropoietin (STEMCELL Technologies). G418 was used for selection at 0.9 mg/ml. The PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) was used at 2 and 8 mm. Myeloid and erythroid colonies were scored after 6–10 days of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Colonies were picked individually under an inverted microscope, and washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution before further analysis. The presence of vector provirus in individual bone marrow progenitor colonies was determined as described (20Emery D.W. Andrews R.G. Papayannopoulou T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In short, DNA was prepared by incubating cells in lysis buffer and proteinase K and precipitating DNA with glycogen and EtOH. Vector template was amplified by PCR using the GFP-specific primers listed in Table 1, and visualization was performed by gel electrophoresis and staining by EtBr. The identity of amplified bands was confirmed by Southern blotting using a probe for GFP. As diagrammed in Fig. 1A, our previous studies involved flanking the gammaretroviral vector MGPN2 with fragments of the cHS4 region using a “double-copy” arrangement and then assessing the effects of these elements on expression of the vector GFP expression cassette (12Aker M. Tubb J. Groth A.C. Bukovsky A.A. Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Kiem H.P. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Emery D.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 2007; 18: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Emery D.W. Yannaki E. Tubb J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9150-9155Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As reported recently (12Aker M. Tubb J. Groth A.C. Bukovsky A.A. Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Kiem H.P. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Emery D.W. Hum. Gene Ther. 2007; 18: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we found that both the full-length 1.2-kb cHS4 fragment and an extended 400-bp cHS4 fragment were equally effective in reducing silencing position effects and thereby improving the likelihood and level of vector GFP expression. In contrast, when used as a single unit, the originally described 250-bp cHS4 core was ineffective in reducing silencing position effects in this setting. To determine whether the additional activity associated with the extended 400-bp cHS4 core was associated with binding of proteins to the extended sequences, we carried out EMSA studies using nuclear extracts from human erythroleukemia K562 cells and 56-bp oligonucleotide probes equally spaced across the additional 3′-region (indicated as fragments VI, VII, and VIII in Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, we found evidence for DNA-binding activities specifically associated with the most distal fragment, FVIII. This included a prominent faster moving doublet (bands d and e), an intermediate band (band c) that appears from later studies to be nonspecific, and a slower moving doublet (bands a and b). Similar results were seen with nuclear extracts from human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (data not shown). During these initial studies, we noted that the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) FVIII probe was prone to instability, resulting in the apparent generation of its ssDNA components or other complexed secondary structures. Further EMSA studies revealed that many of the FVIII-specific bands seen with the dsDNA FVIII probe were also generated with ssDNA versions of the FVIII probe (Fig. 1C). For the (+)-strand, this included bands b and d, whereas with the (−)-strand, this included all four FVIII-specific bands. These results suggest a role for a ssDNA intermediate or unique secondary structure associated with the binding activity. To assess the specificity of this binding, we also carried out competition EMSA studies. As shown in Fig. 1D, essentially all of the binding activities associated with the dsDNA FVIII probe, except for band c, could be competed with both dsDNA and ssDNA versions of the FVIII probe, further demonstrating that both versions of this probe are bound by the same protein(s). The same results were seen with biotinylated versions of the dsDNA and ssDNA FVIII probes used in subsequent studies. Competition studies with probes for the FII site of the cHS4 element, which is known to be bound by the zinc finger protein CTCF, gave mixed results. When used in a dsDNA form, this probe appeared to provide some competition for bands a and b, but no competition for bands d and e. In contrast, competition with a ssDNA version of the FII probe failed to diminish any of the FVIII-specific bands. The studies described above suggest that the FVIII probes exhibited unique physical properties: the dsDNA version of the probe appeared to be unstable; the ssDNA probe appeared to be capable of forming two different structures (for example, see the unbound probes in Fig. 1D, fourth and seventh lanes); and both the dsDNA and ssDNA versions of the probe were apparently bound by the same FVIII-specific protein(s). Thermodynamic modeling (21Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10242) Google Scholar) revealed the potential for stable secondary structures associated with both of the ssDNA FVIII probe sequences. As diagrammed in Fig. 2A, these structures involve stem-loop configurations consisting of stems formed through hybridization of complementary 8-base inverted repeats and 14 base loops. If these secondary structures were retained upon strand annealing, they would result in the cruciform structure diagrammed in Fig. 2B. To determine whether such structures exist in vitro, we digested large DNA fragments containing the full-length cHS4 element with the ssDNA-specific nuclease S1. As diagramed in Fig. 2C, this study provided direct evidence for a ssDNA structure specifically at the FVIII site. In this setting, the FVIII-specific nuclease S1 digestion appeared to be specific for the fragment containing the FVIII site and only involved ∼20% of the DNA strands, suggesting a stochastic and presumably dynamic equilibrium between the ssDNA structure being digested and a conventional dsDNA structure at the FVIII site, providing a ready explanation for the apparent instability of the dsDNA probes for this site. The presence of such a unique secondary structure could also provide a r"
