https://openalex.org/W1571644961,"The sequence of 15,441 nucleotides from the adenovirus-2 genome has been determined and includes the regions between coordinates 0-32% and 89-100%. These regions contain the early (E) transcription units E1A, E1B, E2B, and E4, the genes for polypeptides IVa2 and IX, the COOH terminus of fiber polypeptide, as well as the two virus-associated RNAs and the leader sequences for the major late mRNAs. Analysis of tryptic peptides from the terminal protein and its precursor (Smart, J. E., and Stillman, B. W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13499-13506) has allowed the gene for the precursor terminal protein to be positioned between coordinates 28.0 and 23.5 on the 1-strand. A minimum Mr = 74,500 is predicted. A second, longer open reading frame is also found on the 1-strand between coordinates 22.9 and 14.2 and predicts a polypeptide of at least Mr = 120,000. Many open reading frames longer than 10,000 exist within this sequence although less than half of them can be assigned to previously characterized polypeptides. As with other viral genomes, the available coding information is highly compressed. Intergenic distances are very short and examples are found of genes which overlap either on the same strand or the complementary strand."
https://openalex.org/W1523977310,"A Gal beta 1 to 4GlcNAc alpha 2 to 6 sialyltransferse and a Gal beta 1 to 3(4)GlcNAc alpha 2 to 3 sialyltransferase have been purified 23,000- and 860,000-fold to homogeneity from Triton CF-54 extracts of rat liver membranes. The two enzymes were concentrated by affinity chromatography on CDP-hexanolamine-agarose and resolved by NaCl gradient elution from the same adsorbent. Final purification of the Gal beta 1 to 4GlcNAc alpha 2 to 6 sialytransferase, the most abundant enzyme, was achieved by specific elution from CDP-agarose with CDP. The Gal beta 1 to 3(4)GlcNAc alpha 2 to 3 sialyltransferase was also purified further by CDP elution from CDP-agarose, but final purification required affinity chromatography on an adsorbent prepared by coupling asialoprothrombin to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose. Asialoprothrombin contains the terminal sequence Gal beta 1 to 3GlcNAc on N-linked oligosaccharides and is the best acceptor substrate of the enzyme (Km congruent to 6 microM). The Gal beta 1 to 3(4)GlcNAc alpha 2 to 3 sialyltransferase was found to bind to asialoprothrombin-agarose in the presence of CDP and could be eluted with a solution containing 0.2 M lactose and no CDP. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of the Gal beta 1 to 4GlcNAc alpha 2 to 6 and Gal beta 1 to 3(4)GlcNAc alpha 2 to 3 sialyltransferases revealed a single major protein band for each enzyme with apparent molecular weights of 40,500 and 44,000, respectively. Rabbit antibodies raised to the Gal beta 1 to 4GlcNAc alpha 2 to 6 sialyltransferase inhibit its enzymatic activity greater than 99% but caused little or no inhibition of Gal beta 1 to 3(4)GlcNAc alpha 2 to 3 sialytransferase. Moreover, the Gal beta 1 to 4GlcNAc alpha 2 to 6 sialyltransferase quantitatively bound to a column containing antibody adsorbed to Protein A-agarose, while the Gal beta 1 to 3(4) GlcNAc alpha 2 to 3 sialyltransferase did not bind. This demonstrated that the two sialyltransferases are antigenically unrelated and formed the basis for removal of contaminating Gal beta 1 to 4GlcNAc alpha 2 to 6 sialyltransferase from solutions of the Gal beta 1 to 3(4)GlcNAc alpha 2 to 3 sialyltransferase. Enzymatic characterization of the two sialyltransferases suggests that their major biological roles are in the terminal glycosylation of N-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. (Weinstein, J., de Souza-e-Silva, U., and Paulson J. C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13845-13853. The alpha 2 to 6 sialyltransferase efficiently forms the NeuAc alpha 2 to 6Gal beta 1 to 4GlcNAc sequence, and the alpha 2 to 3 sialyltransferase forms the NeuAc alpha 2 to 3Gal beta 1 to 3GlcNAc and NeuAc alpha 2 to 3Ga; beta 1 to 4GlcNAc sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1568120202,"Cytochrome P-450 isozyme 3a, isolated from hepatic microsomes of rabbits treated chronically with ethanol, was found to have a unique substrate specificity when compared with isozymes 2, 3b, 3c, and 4. Form 3a has unusually high activity in the p-hydroxylation of aniline and in the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. These properties are reflected in the increased activities of these substrates in microsomes from ethanol-treated rabbits as compared to microsomes from untreated animals or those administered phenobarbital or 5,6-benzoflavone. The ethanol-oxidizing activity of isozyme 3a, which requires the presence of NADPH and NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase and is stimulated by the presence of phospholipid, was shown not to be due to contaminating catalase or an NAD- or NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase. Isozyme 3a catalyzes the oxidation of methanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol as well as ethanol; the relationships between the apparent Km values for these alcohols and their octanol-water partition coefficients is in accord with the known hydrophobic nature of the P-450 binding site. Whereas typical substrates of isozyme 2 are known to be metabolized with the stoichiometry predicted of a monooxygenase reaction, with isozyme 3a the sum of acetaldehyde formed from ethanol and of hydrogen peroxide generated is inadequate to account for the NADPH and oxygen consumed. Free hydroxyl radicals appear to mediate the slow oxidation of ethanol in the presence of the reductase alone but not the faster rate catalyzed by P-450 isozyme 3a. The results obtained, however, do not rule out the involvement of hydroxyl radical equivalent generated and bound at the active site of the cytochrome."

https://openalex.org/W110705983,"Ultraviolet light induces alkaline labile lesions in DNA. These lesions occur at the bipyrimidine sites T-C, C-C, and T-T, and do not result from the formation of pyrimidine cyclobutane dimers. To examine the chemical nature of the alkaline labile lesions, pyrimidine dinucleotides (2'-deoxythymidylyl-(3' leads to 5')-2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-deoxythymidylyl-(3' leads to 5')-2'-deoxythymidine, 2'-deoxycytidylyl-(3' leads to 5')-2-deoxycytidine, and 2'-deoxycytidylyl-(3' leads to 5')-2'-deoxythymidine) were used as a model system. Ultraviolet light irradiation of all four dinucleotides resulted in the formation of substantial quantities (relative to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers) of products that were red-shifted in UV absorbance and fluorescent. These products are identified as precursors to the 6-4'-[pyrimidin-2'-one]-pyrimidine class of products that have been previously shown to occur in UV-irradiated DNA. The fluorescent products were found to be alkaline labile; the products contained a 3'-phosphate end group after alkali treatment. Two of the fluorescent products have been found in enzymatic digests of high dose UV-irradiated salmon sperm DNA, the T-C and T-T UV-induced products. The relative rates of formation of these products in 32P-radiolabeled dinucleotides were measured. We conclude that the alkaline labile lesions observed in DNA at the bipyrimidine sites are the same as those that yield the 6-4 products upon acid hydrolysis of DNA. The mechanisms for the formation and the consequences of DNA structure for these lesions as well as the possible biological significance of this class of UV damage are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1542542441,"Superoxide dismutase of Propionibacterium shermanii, an anaerobic that produces an iron superoxide dismutase, was purified from cells grown in iron-free conditions. The enzyme isolated was found to contain manganese and to have spectral and catalytic properties very similar to those of typical Mn-superoxide dismutases. Its electrophoretic mobility, molecular weight, and subunit size were identical with those of the Fe-enzyme. Amino acid compositions were practically indistinguishable in either case. The NH2-terminal sequence was found to be identical. The catalytic activity of an apoprotein sample prepared from the purified holoenzyme was restored by adding either Mn(II) or Fe(II). Only the metal/protein ratio varied from approximately 1 per subunit in the case of the Fe-enzyme to approximately 2 for the Mn-enzyme. It is concluded that this bacterium can accommodate either Fe or Mn on identical, or very slightly dissimilar, proteins forming active sites with the properties found in specific metallodismutases."
https://openalex.org/W1580792258,"A toxic protein, viscumin, was isolated from extracts of mistletoe by affinity chromatography on acid-treated Sepharose 4B. Viscumin was selectively bound to the column and could be eluted with lactose. It migrated in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate corresponding to Mr = 60,000. In addition, two bands migrating corresponding to Mr = 29,000 and 32,000 were found. After treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, only 2 bands (Mr = 29,000 and 34,000) were found. Apparently, viscumin consists of two chains which, in some of the molecules, are disulfide-linked. Protection experiments with antiserum against viscumin indicated that the major part of the cytotoxic activity in mistletoe extracts is due to viscumin. Gel filtration experiments on Sephacryl 200 indicated that, at low concentrations, viscumin occurs as a monomer and at higher concentrations as a dimer. Viscumin was found to inhibit protein synthesis in cell-free systems. When the two constituent peptide chains of viscumin were eluted from polyacrylamide gels and tested for ability to inhibit cell-free protein synthesis, this property was found to be associated with the fastest migrating chain, here denoted the A chain. The heavier chain was denoted the B chain. The A chain was found to inhibit protein synthesis by inactivating the ribosomes catalytically. Reconstitution experiments with isolated ribosomal subunits from untreated and A chain-treated ribosomes showed that the 60 S ribosomal subunit was selectively inactivated."
https://openalex.org/W1522731119,"Immunochemical studies on urine from a patient with ovarian cancer revealed the presence of a tumor-associated peptide. This peptide occurred in elevated concentrations in the urine of some patients with gynecologic cancer, in early amniotic fluid, and in some cancer tumor extracts from these patients as described previously (Stenman, U.-H., Huhtala, M.-L., Koistinen, R., and Seppala, M. (1982) Int. J. Cancer 30, 53-47). The peptide has now been purified from the urine of a patient with ovarian cancer by gel chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and reverse phase liquid chromatography. The amino acid composition of the peptide is: Lys (4), Arg (3), Asx (8), Thr (4), Ser (3), Glx (6), Pro (3), Gly (5), Ala (1), Val (2), Ile (3), Leu (4), Tyr (3), Phe (1), and Cys (6). These 56 amino acids correspond to Mr = 62000 for the peptide, a value that is in agreement with the molecular weight established by gel chromatography. The molecule contains no carbohydrate. It is microheterogeneous in charge, the isoelectric point of the main component being 5.8. The purity of the peptide was confirmed by determination of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. The 21 residues determined were found to be identical with the corresponding ones of human pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. The purified peptide also inhibited bovine trypsin effectively."
https://openalex.org/W1595120807,"When enzymes are exposed to ionizing radiation at low temperatures there is a progressive decrease in radiation sensitivity: considerably more enzymatic activity remains after the same dose of radiation at low temperature compared to room temperature. Detailed studies of five enzymes reveals the quantitative relationship between radiation sensitivity and temperature during exposure. Although 25 enzymes are shown to display this same relationship, recent reports have denied this effect in three enzymes. In this paper, we investigate two possible artifacts that could cause these discrepancies: 1) inaccurate determination of the temperature of the sample during irradiation, and 2) use of temperature-sensitive dosimeters to measure radiation dose. Procedures are described that carefully control these parameters. Thermoluminescent dosimeters are shown to be independent of temperature effects. These methods are used to investigate one of the enzymes, malate dehydrogenase, that has been reported to have a temperature-insensitive radiation inactivation. The radiation sensitivity of this enzyme is found to show the same temperature dependence as 24 other enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2097723222,"Histone acetylation, DNA replicative synthesis, UV-induced DNA repair synthesis, and UV-induced endonuclease-sensitive sites were measured in normal human fibroblasts and xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts (complementation groups A, C, and D) following exposure to sodium butyrate. In all four cell types, treatment with millimolar concentrations of sodium butyrate resulted in a hyperacetylation of the core histones. Furthermore, following an exposure of 20 mM sodium butyrate for 48 h, the extent of hyperacetylation was the same in each cell type. In agreement with previous reports, we observed a marked decrease in DNA replicative synthesis in each cell type following increasing times of exposure to sodium butyrate. On the other hand, we observed a marked increase in DNA repair synthesis occurring during early times after UV irradiation in normal cells and in two of the xeroderma pigmentosum cell strains (groups C and D). This increase appeared to correlate with the increase in the highest acetylated form of histone H4. Furthermore, the total number of endonuclease-sensitive sites (i.e. prior to the onset of repair) induced by UV radiation was the same in both butyrated-treated and untreated normal cells over the dose range of 0-20 J/m2. However, the initial rate of removal of these sites increased in butyrate-treated normal cells. These results indicate that sodium butyrate stimulates the initial rate of nucleotide excision repair in both normal and (partially) repair-deficient human cells at concentrations where the histones are maximally hyperacetylated."
https://openalex.org/W197744617,"The photosensitive m-diazirinophenyl analog of retinal (Fig. 1, II) bound to bacterio-opsin at Lys-216 and regenerated a chromophore with lambda max at 470 nm. Photolysis of the complex at 365 nm resulted in covalent cross-linking of the retinal analog to the bacterio-opsin in greater 30% yield. Investigation of the sites of cross-linking between the 3H-labeled retinal analog and the protein showed the peptide fragment (amino acid residues 190-248) to be the main radioactively labeled product. Stepwise Edman degradation showed Ser-193 and Glu-194 to be the predominant sites of cross-linking. These results show that the chromophore in bacteriorhodopsin is inclined towards helix 6 and towards the exterior of the cell. These data also provide information on the approximate angle that the chromophore makes with the plane of the membrane and they require a modification of the current secondary structure model for bacteriorhodopsin."

https://openalex.org/W1570602397,"A 32-residue polypeptide fragment, designated alpha I, of rat liver metallothionein obtained by subtilisin digestion was studied by 113Cd NMR. The amino acid composition of the fragment corresponded to residues 30-61 of the metallothionein primary structure, and it contained 3.4 g atoms of Cd2+/mol of alpha I-fragment. Four 113Cd resonances were observed, three of which had identical chemical shifts to those assigned to the four-metal cluster in human liver metallothionein-2 under the same pH and buffer conditions. The 5-ppm chemical shift difference between the remaining resonance assigned to the four-metal cluster in the intact protein can be explained to result from the removal of the NH2-terminal polypeptide fragment containing the three-metal cluster. These results provide unambiguous evidence for the two-domain structure of metallothionein, containing a separate three- and a four-metal cluster."
https://openalex.org/W138715116,"The adenovirus terminal protein precursor functions as a primer for the initiation of virus DNA replication by covalently binding the first nucleotide in the DNA chain. It remains covalently attached to the 5'-ends of the virus DNA and is cleaved to the terminal protein during virion maturation. The gene encoding the terminal protein precursor maps within a 7-kilobase region of the virus genome, which specifies multiple mRNA and protein species. We have determined the location, within this region, of the coding sequences for the terminal protein precursor by aligning partial amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence predicted from the DNA sequence. The open translational reading frame between coordinates 23.4 and 28.9 on the genome contains the majority of the coding sequences for the precursor protein. The virion terminal protein derives from COOH terminus of the precursor protein. Using this information, the site within the protein of covalent attachment to the DNA has been determined. This site also corresponds to that which covalently binds dCMP, the first nucleotide in nascent DNA synthesized in vitro. The coding region for terminal protein precursor does not overlap the region to which the N-group of adenovirus mutants has been mapped. We suggest that these mutants define a protein, other than terminal protein, which also functions in the initiation of virus DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1590243396,"alpha-Chloroisocaproate has been shown to inhibit phosphorylation and inactivation of rabbit liver branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase was also inhibited by this alpha-ketoisocaproate analog, but phosphorylation of branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase was much more sensitive than phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (I50 values of 7.5 and 675 microM, respectively). Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by six other protein kinases was not inhibited by alpha-chloroisocaproate (1 mM). Although less sensitive than phosphorylation of the complex, branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase was also found inhibited by alpha-chloroisocaproate. The latter inhibition was competitive with respect to the alpha-ketoacid substrates of the dehydrogenase (Ki values of approximately 0.5 mM). alpha-Chloroisocaproate greatly stimulated the capacity of the perfused rat heart to decarboxylate [1-14C]leucine and promoted conversion of practically all (99%) of the complex into the active form."
https://openalex.org/W1582027534,"A toxin from mistletoe, viscumin, inhibited the incorporation of leucine in cells more rapidly than the incorporation of uridine and thymidine, indicating that the toxins act by inhibiting cellular protein synthesis. The presence of galactose, lactose, and melibiose in the medium protected cells against viscumin. The sensitivity to viscumin of different cell lines differed considerably. The cytotoxic properties of viscumin were compared to those of the related toxins abrin, ricin, and modeccin. The profile of the sensitivity of a panel of cell lines to viscumin was dissimilar from those obtained with abrin and modeccin. Cell lines selected for resistance to modeccin and ricin were fully sensitive to viscumin. Ca2+ was required for viscumin to express its toxic effect. In contrast, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 protected the cells against viscumin. Whereas the sensitivity of cells to viscumin did not vary much between pH 7 and 9, the cells were much less sensitive at pH 6. Also, cells treated with the two metabolic inhibitors, 2-deoxyglucose and NaN3, were insensitive to the toxins. Viscumin taken up by cells in the absence of Ca2+ or at pH 6 was able to intoxicate the cells when Ca2+ was added or when the pH was adjusted to neutrality. In contrast, cells exposed to viscumin in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose and NaN3, which inhibit endocytosis, were not intoxicated when the cells were treated with antiviscumin and then transferred to normal medium. The results indicate that endocytosis is involved in the entry of viscumin."
https://openalex.org/W1536465820,"Using 45CaCl2, we measured the effect of ADP and epinephrine on exchangeable Ca2+ pools in gel-filtered platelets. Unstimulated platelets contained 1) a slowly exchangeable pool, representing 54% of the exchangeable Ca2+, that was unaffected by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid and was, therefore, presumably intracellular; and 2) a rapidly exchangeable pool, representing 46% of the Ca2+, that appeared to be surface-bound because it was removable by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetic acid or LaCl3. Equilibrium studies of this surface-bound Ca2+ revealed two classes of saturable binding sites, one class of 57,000 sites with a high affinity (KD = 5 x 10(-9) M) and another of 460,000 sites with a lower affinity for Ca2+ (KD = 3 x 10(-7) M). Two changes were observed with ADP and epinephrine. First, the amount of surface-bound Ca2+ increased by up to 50%. In the case of ADP, this included an increase in the number of lower affinity Ca2+ binding sites by 28%. Epinephrine increased the number of lower affinity sites by 18% (p less than 0.001). Second, while not increasing the amount of intracellular Ca2+, both agonists increased by 40% the rate of Ca2+ exchange into the intracellular pool. These effects were rapid (less than 1 min), dependent on agonist concentration, and inhibited by prostaglandin I2 or by specific antagonists of ADP or epinephrine binding. Thus, we find no evidence for a net influx of Ca2+ into platelets stimulated by ADP or epinephrine. However, both agonists increase the amount of Ca2+ bound to the platelet surface membrane. This bound Ca2+ may participate in several membrane reactions involved in platelet activation."

https://openalex.org/W1595817081,"Previous studies have shown that in the presence of ADP, myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) binds with positive cooperativity to the troponin-tropomyosin-actin complex (regulated actin). This binding is much more cooperative in the absence than in the presence of Ca2+. Based on these data, we proposed a model (Hill, T. L., Eisenberg, E., and Greene, L. E. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 7209-7213) in which the tropomyosin-actin units in regulated actin exist in two states, a state which binds S-1 weakly and a state which binds S-1 strongly. This model predicts that the equilibrium constant between the weak and strong states of the tropomyosin-actin units is an intrinsic property of the regulated actin filament. Therefore, its value should not change when measured with different nucleotides bound to S-1. To test this prediction, the equilibrium constant was measured in the presence of S-1, S-1 . ADP, and S-1 . AMP-PNP, with and without Ca2+. The results show that, in all cases, S-1 binds with positive cooperativity to regulated actin. The observed cooperativity is consistent with the model since it was possible to fit the data obtained in the presence of different nucleotides with the same value for the equilibrium constant between the weak and strong states of the tropomyosin-actin units. However, the nucleotide bound to S-1 appears to affect the observed cooperativity by changing the affinity of S-1 for the strong and weak states."
https://openalex.org/W1492196323,"We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a 5783-base pair segment of adenovirus type 2 DNA, located between map coordinates 15.8 and 31.7. This region of the adenovirus-2 genome encodes the three segments of the tripartite leader, the i-leader and the two species of virus-associated RNA. The established sequence reveals two translational reading frames encoded by the viral 1-strand which have remarkably large coding capacities. One of these is located between map coordinates 28.9 and 23.5 and encodes a hypothetical polypeptide with an estimated Mr = 74,000. This polypeptide is in an accompanying paper (Smart, J. E., and Stillman, B. W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13499-13506) identified as the precursor for the terminal protein which is covalently attached to the ends of adenovirus DNA. The second large open translational reading frame starts with an ATG triplet at coordinate 22.9 and encodes a hypothetical polypeptide with a predicted Mr = 120,400. This polypeptide is most likely the product of the N-gene, previously mapped between coordinates 18.0 and 22.5 (Galos, R. S., Williams, J., Binger, M. H., and Flint, S. J. (1979) Cell 17, 945-956). The sequence of the r-strand discloses several open translational reading frames, one of which is located within the i-leader."
https://openalex.org/W1500476341,"In chicken embryo fibroblasts pulsed wih [35S]methionine, a precursor of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase with higher molecular weight (delta Mr approximately 3000) was detected by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Peptide mapping of the precursor and the mature enzyme confirmed their precursor-product relationship. No precursor of the homologous cytosolic isoenzyme was found. The precursor of the mitochondrial isoenzyme is synthesized on membrane-free polysomes in the cytosol (Sonderegger, P., Jaussi, R., Christen, P., and Gehring, H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3339-3345); its half-life is 30 to 60 s. The pronounced susceptibility of the precursor toward exogenous proteases contrasts the stability of the mature enzyme and thus indicates that the conformation or the quarternary structure of the protein must change concomitantly with its import into mitochondria. Administration of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to the cell cultures blocks the import of many matrix and inner membrane proteins into mitochondria. The precursor of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase is found to be accumulated in the cytosol. However, its steady state concentration in CCCP-treated cells exceeds the concentration in untreated cells by not more than 1 order of magnitude. During a chase, the radioactive precursor disappears with a half-life of approximately 5 with min without formation of mature enzyme. Thus, in CCCP-treated cells, a degradative process is limiting the accumulation of the precursor in the cytosol. When the chase is performed in the presence of cysteamine, an antagonist of CCCP, the precursor is processed to the mature enzyme. Newly synthesized cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase is not degraded."
https://openalex.org/W1522275893,"A pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase has been purified 20,000-fold from Micrococcus luteus. The enzyme is a single polypeptide chain with Mr = 18,000 that acts specifically on pyrimidine dimers, preferring those in double-stranded DNA to those in single-stranded DNA. The glycosylase cleaves the 5' residue of a pyrimidine dimer generating an apyrimidinic site and a mixed pyrimidine/pyrimidine nucleotide dimer. Under conditions of substrate excess, dimers containing a 5'-thymine are preferred to those with a 5'-cytosine residue. The glycosylase has an associated apyrimidinic/apurinic (AP) endonuclease that prefers apyrimidinic sites at the site of glycosylase action to either apurinic or apyrimidinic residues. This endonuclease is a Class I AP endonuclease in that it cleaves 3' to the AP site generating a 3'-deoxyribose moiety and a 5'-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1586472967,"Regulation of glucose metabolism in glycolysis by round spermatids was studied. Assay of activities of 11 glycolytic enzymes in cell-free spermatid extracts showed that hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase had the lowest activities. When the cells were incubated with glucose (10 mM), the intracellular level of ATP fell rapidly and 5'-AMP increased. The ADP level remained unchanged. During incubation with glucose, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate were accumulated without any change in a mass action ratio of fructose bisphosphate aldolase. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase appeared to play a regulatory role in glycolysis. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was inhibited by the following compounds (Ki values in parentheses): adenosine (4.34 mM), 5'-AMP (3.50 mM), ADP (2.35 mM), ATP (5.34 mM), and 3',5'-cAMP (0.60 mM). In each case, the inhibition was competitive with NAD (Km = 0.20 mM). The 2'-hydroxy group of the adenine-linked ribose moiety was essential for binding. The compounds adenine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-AMP, 3'-AMP, CTP, GTP, UTP, and NADP showed little inhibition. These findings suggest that regulation of glycolysis in round spermatids by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is most likely and that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is inhibited by the adenine nucleotides, particularly by 5'-AMP and ADP as inhibitors competitive with NAD."
https://openalex.org/W1634390593,"Cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells accumulated labeled folate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and metabolized these compounds to polyglutamates of chain length up to 10, with hexa-, hepta-, and octaglutamates predominating. Intracellular vitamin was concentrated up to 50-fold, although the intracellular pteroylmonoglutamate concentration did not exceed that in the medium. Folylpolyglutamate levels in mutant cells (AUXB1), which are defective in the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase, were less than 1.5% of wild type levels, while pteroylmonoglutamate levels were normal. Tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates were the most effective polyglutamate substrates for the Chinese hamster ovary cell folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The final distribution of folylpolyglutamates in this cells appeared to be a reflection of the ability of different glutamate chain length folates to act as substrates for the synthetase. The proportions of individual folylpolyglutamates were unaffected by culturing the cells in medium containing or lacking products of one carbon metabolism such as glycine, adenosine, or thymidine. However, these proportions were markedly influenced by the level of methionine in the culture medium. The possible significance of changes in the glutamate chain length of folates under different nutritional conditions in relationship to the regulation of one carbon metabolism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1502854840,"The effect of citrate on the structure and function of porcine heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) has been characterized. The native dimeric form of this enzyme is specifically activated by citrate in the NAD+ leads to NADH direction and inhibited by citrate in the NADH leads to NAD+ direction. It is proposed that citrate is bound at a regulatory site that is distinct from the catalytic site of the enzyme. In binding to this regulatory site, citrate greatly reduces the binding of NADH as determined by fluorescence titration and experiments, but does not diminish the binding of NAD+. As would be expected for an effector altering the equilibrium between two conformational forms of an enzyme, citrate favorably perturbs the equilibrium for the reaction in the direction of NAD+ reduction. Using [14C]citrate, the stoichiometry of citrate binding to mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase has been determined to be two equivalent sites per dimer, with a dissociation constant of 12.5 microM. In detailed kinetic studies, it has also been observed that activation by citrate abolishes (masks) the enzymatic activation induced by high concentrations of the substrate, L-malate. In addition, Hummel-Dreyer-type experiments indicate that less than a stoichiometric amount of NADH is bound to the enzyme under conditions of malate activation. These data are consistent with a previously suggested second substrate binding site proposed to explain the enzymatic activation observed at high concentrations of the substrate, L-malate (Telegdi, M., Wolfe, D. V., and Wolfe, R. G. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6484-6489). This allosteric site may exist only on the enzyme conformation capable of binding NAD+."
https://openalex.org/W1679166880,"The heparin-enhanced antithrombin III/thrombin reaction was studied under experimental conditions where the dependence of the reaction velocity on the concentrations of thrombin and antithrombin III could be determined. The results have shown that the reaction is saturable with respect to both thrombin (KT = 3.6 x 10(-8) M) and antithrombin III (KAT = 1.0 x 10(-7) M) when the heparin concentration is low relative to the initial protein concentrations. The apparent first order rate constant for the rate-limiting step in the reaction was approximately 800 min-1. The reaction was subject to inhibition by antithrombin III/thrombin, the product of the reaction. Inhibition appeared to be noncompetitive with respect to antithrombin II with KP, the apparent heparin product dissociation constant, approximately equal to KT. When the heparin-enhanced antithrombin III/thrombin reaction was studied under conditions where the heparin concentration was high relative to the initial protein concentrations the overall reaction was second order. The initial reaction velocity, under any set of experimental conditions, could be described by the general rate equation for a random order bireactant, enzyme-catalyzed reaction, which is mathematically identical with the template model for the mechanism of action of heparin (Griffith, M. J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7360-7365)."
https://openalex.org/W1494530939,"Gabaculine, 5-amino-1,3-cyclohexadienylcarboxylate, is a very efficient enzyme-activated inhibitor of gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase (Rando, R. R. (1977) Biochemistry 16, 4604-4610). However, enzymes for which gamma-aminobutyrate is not a substrate are also inactivated by gabaculine. Thus, purified D-amino acid transaminase, L-alanine transaminase, and L-aspartate transaminase are also inactivated (Ki values of 0.1 mM, 1 mM, and 55 mM, respectively). The effects of this inhibitor on such a diverse group of enzymes appear to be related to the enzymic exchange of beta-protons of their normal substrates. L-Alanine transaminase and L-aspartate transaminase are known to catalyze such an exchange (Walter, U., Luthe, H., Gerhart, F., and Soling, H.-D. (1975) Eur. J. Biochem. 59, 395-403). D-Amino acid transaminase and gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase, which are inactivated by gabaculine, also catalyze exchange of the beta-protons of their substrates. Alanine racemase and tryptophanase, which are known not to catalyze an analogous exchange, were found to be insensitive to gabaculine. We postulate that aromatization of gabaculine, in which the beta-proton is removed, is an enzyme-catalyzed event for those pyridoxal phosphate enzymes that have a nucleophilic group at the active site to catalyze this process."
https://openalex.org/W1503358845,"Analogs of (A2'p)2A core and ppp(A2'p)2A were chemically synthesized and their susceptibility to phosphodiesterase degradation and ability to either activate an endonuclease or to inhibit cell growth were determined. The absence of the internal 3'-OH groups ((3'dA2'p)2A) resulted in a 5-fold increase in stability, but also in a 10-fold decrease in activity, as measured by (a) activation of an endonuclease in cell-free extracts and inhibition of protein synthesis in intact cells by the 5'-triphosphate species and (b) inhibition of DNA synthesis in synchronized cells by the core analogs. An uncharged derivative of this analog containing two methylphosphotriesters, although significantly more stable, was even less active. Additional deletion of the terminal 3'-OH ((3'd A2'p)23'dA) resulted in a further 6-fold increase in stability (30-fold overall increase in stability), as well as approximately a 2-fold increase in ability to inhibit cell growth, as compared to the natural 2'5' A core. The analog lacking a terminal 2'-OH as well as lacking the internal 3'-OH group ((3'dA2'p)22'dA) showed an overall 15-fold increased stability, yet showed very little activity in inhibiting cell growth. The most stable (120-fold increased overall stability) as well as most active analog was a xyloadenosine analog of 2'5' A core, (xyloA2'p)2xyloA. These results show that modification of the 3'-terminal OH appears to be most important in increasing 2'-5' A core stability as well as biological activity. However, the mechanism of cell growth inhibition by these 2'-5' A core analogs may involve pathways different from those utilized by the 2'-5' A-dependent endonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1532390897,"A novel bis-sulfated tetraglycosylceramide containing N-acetylgalactosamine was isolated from the lipid extract of rat kidney. The isolation procedure involved extraction of lipids with chloroform/methanol, alkaline methanolysis, and column chromatographies with DEAE-Sephacel and silica beads. By infrared spectroscopy, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, periodate oxidation, solvolysis, chromium trioxide oxidation, and methylation analysis of the native and partially degraded compounds, the structure of this glycolipid is proposed to be (HSO3-3)Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4(HSO3-3)Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer. The position of sulfate ester groups and the sequence of carbohydrates were further confirmed by methylation analysis and direct probe mass spectrometry after desulfation-trideuteriomethylation of permethylated glycolipids. The yield of this sulfoglycolipid was 5.5 nmol/g of tissue, which was about 25 and 50 mol %, respectively, of monosulfo-and bis-sulfogangliotriaosylceramide from rat kidney."

https://openalex.org/W1490543570,"Stopped flow experiments were carried out with purified hog thyroid peroxidase (A413 nm/A280 nm = 0.42). In the steady state of oxidations of L- and D-tyrosines, N-acetyltyrosinamide, and monoiodotyrosine, thyroid peroxidase existed in the form of Compound I, the primary catalytic intermediate of peroxidase in its reaction with H2O2. Kinetic results led us to conclude that thyroid peroxidase catalyzes two-electron oxidations of these molecules. In the steady state of oxidation of diiodotyrosine, on the other hand, the enzyme was found in the form of compound II at pH 7.4, but in the form of compound I at pH 5.5. The result implies that the mechanism of diiodotyrosine oxidation varied from a one-electron to a two-electron type as the pH decreased. The selection of mechanisms of oxidation appears to be peculiar to thyroid peroxidase; horseradish peroxidase and lactoperoxidase catalyzed only one-electron oxidations of these five donor molecules. Rate constants for rate-limiting steps in the reactions of these donor molecules with the three peroxidases were measured by overall kinetic and stopped flow kinetic methods."
https://openalex.org/W1493724377,"Addition of alpha 1-adrenergic agonists or vasopressin to the medium perfusing rat livers was associated with a rapid efflux of Ca2+, which was rapidly reaccumulated on removal of the stimulus. The magnitudes of the respective Ca2+ efflux and influx responses were similar, suggesting that Ca2+ was being mobilized from, and then reaccumulated into, the same pool(s). Addition of combinations of alpha 1-agonists, vasopressin and angiotensin II to isolated hepatocytes revealed that the Ca2+ efflux response induced by each individual hormone could only be augmented by addition of a second hormone when submaximal doses of each were employed. This suggests that an identical pool(s) of hepatocyte Ca2+ is mobilized in response to each of these agents. No desensitization of the alpha 1-adrenergic glycogenolytic response was observed in the perfused liver, upon repeated or more prolonged (25 min) exposure to agonist, providing cell Ca2+ reaccumulation occurred before addition of each successive stimulus. Selective short term stimulation of the beta 2-adrenergic glycogenolytic response in immature male rats (less than 150 g, body weight) was not associated with desensitization to subsequent stimulation. These data demonstrate that the glycogenolytic response of liver cells does not become desensitized by successive short term stimulation with alpha 1- or beta 2-adrenergic agonists."

https://openalex.org/W1660091934,"Endothelial cells incorporate 35SO4 into a class of glycoproteins which are released from the cell layer into the culture medium. The incorporated 35SO4 was localized on intact oligosaccharide chains which were released from the protein either chemically by hydrazinolysis or enzymatically by a peptide: N-glycosidase activity; thus these 35S-oligosaccharides are presumably N-glycosidically linked to protein. These 35S-oligosaccharides were also isolated and analyzed as labeled glycopeptides and found to contain the terminal trisaccharide sequence sialic acid leads to galactose leads to N-acetylglucosamine. After removal of these carbohydrate residues, the remainder of this 35S-glycopeptide was susceptible to alpha-mannosidase digestion yielding a smaller 35 S-glycopeptide containing GlcNAc35SO4. Monensin (10(-8) M), a monovalent cation ionophore, inhibited the sulfation (greater than 80%) and synthesis (greater than 60%) of endothelial cell-sulfated proteoglycans which were released into the culture medium. However, neither the synthesis nor sulfation of cell-released 35S-glycoproteins was affected at similar monensin concentrations. Higher concentrations of monensin (greater 5 X 10(-8) M) inhibited the incorporation of both [3H]glucosamine and 35SO4 into cell-released glycoproteins.U"
https://openalex.org/W178989243,"[3H]Doxepin, a tricyclic antidepressant, binds with high affinity to guinea pig brain membranes with a drug specificity indicating an association with H1 histamine receptors. The [3H]doxepin binding site has been solubilized, with digitonin being the only detergent able to maintain specific binding after solubilization. After solubilization, the kinetics and drug specificity of binding are virtually identical with those obtained in the intact membranes, indicating a conservation of the transmitter binding site after removal of the receptor from its lipid environment. The regulation of agonist affinity for the histamine H1 receptor by cations is maintained after solubilization. Sodium and to a similar extent lithium, but not potassium, rubidium, or cesium, decrease the affinity of agonists for the receptor. The divalent cations manganese and magnesium maintain their ability to increase agonist affinity after solubilization. Guanine nucleotides, however, lose their ability to decrease agonist affinity for the histamine H1 receptor after solubilization. Histamine receptors in rat brain differ from guinea pig brain receptors in the potency of several antihistamines. The difference is maintained in the solubilized receptors. Sucrose gradient and gel filtration experiments indicated Mr approximately 430,000 for the receptor-digitonin complex. The isoelectric point of the receptor is 4.8. None of these physical techniques distinguishes between guinea pig and rat brain receptors."

The isolation procedure, which results in a 20,000-fold purification and an overall yield of 15%, employs chromatography on a gel of octyl succinic anhydride coupled to agarose by diaminohexane spacers, isoelectric focusing, Sephadex G-75 chromatography, and DNA agarose affinity chromatography. Under conditions in which proteolysis is minimized, this enzyme appears to be the major species of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease. The endonuclease is a monomeric protein with an apparent Mr = 37,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has a pI of 7.4-7.6, requires Mg2+, is partially stimulated by Mn2+, and is inhibited by EDTA. It has no detectable exonuclease or phosphomonoesterase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1655527932,"Binding energies of progesterone analogues with single modifications were calculated from their affinities for the cytosolic receptor of rabbit uteri. The effects of individual substituents were analyzed in terms of hydrogen bonds, van der Waals' forces, and hydrophobic interactions. Binding to the receptor is attributed to hydrogen bonds involving the ketones at carbons 3 and 20, and van der Waals' interactions at carbons 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 18, and 19 at which positions the separation of the steroid from the receptor appears to be about 0.1 nm or less. Greater separation occurs at carbons 6, 11, 14, 15, 16, and 21. The receptor probably has a hydrogen acceptor approximating the 11 beta position of the bound steroid. The enthalpy of binding of the progesterone molecule is about 26 kcal/mol but on the basis that the two hydrogen bonds contribute about 6 kcal/mol and each of the van der Waals' attractions about 1 kcal/mol, the sum of the individual bonds totals only about 20 kcal/mol. The difference of 6 kcal/mol is attributed to intrareceptor bonds that are established after a change in receptor conformation is initiated by progesterone binding. This change in conformation fixes the steroid in its protein niche and retards dissociation. We speculate that this alteration in conformation is related to activation and possibly other functions of the complex."

https://openalex.org/W1526907666,"We have isolated a mutant Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) with a mutation in its envelope (env) glycoprotein gene. This mutant encodes a membrane glycoprotein with an apparent Mr = 80,000 (gPr80env) that contains both gp70 and p15E antigenic determinants found in the larger wild type R-MuLV env precursor molecule gPr90env. Glycosylation inhibition and peptide mapping analyses indicate that the smaller size of the mutant glycoprotein is caused by a shortening of its polypeptide chain rather than by reduced glycosylation. Unlike gPr90env of wild type R-MuLV which contains Asn-linked high mannose oligosaccharides and is processed by partial proteolysis and by further glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus to produce gp70 plus p15E, the mutant glycoprotein can reach the cell surface without proteolysis. The uncleaved plasma membrane component, which undergoes further glycosylation during its transit through the Golgi apparatus, has an apparent Mr = 85,000. Furthermore, this cell surface glycoprotein is incorporated into released virions which are infectious. However, the mutant envelope glycoproteins on the cell surface do not block the receptors needed for superinfection by wild type MuLV. These results indicate that transport of uncleaved env gene-encoded glycoproteins to the cell surface is not a unique attribute to leukemia-producing recombinant of dual tropic MuLVs (Famulari, N. G., and English, J. K. (1981) J. Virol. 40, 971-976) but can also occur with a mutant of ecotropic MuLV."
https://openalex.org/W1605821839,"We have analyzed the RNA synthetic activity in intact HTC cells which have artificially high or low levels of histone acetylation. Rates of total RNA synthesis and the number of nascent transcription complexes have been measured for 20-h butyrate-treated cells and for butyrate-released cells which contain hypoacetylated histones. Exposure of HTC cells to butyrate for 20 h leads to a approximately 40% decrease in the number of nascent RNA molecules and a corresponding approximately 40% decrease in the rate of total RNA synthesis. During the induction of hypoacetylation following the release of cells from butyrate, rates of RNA synthesis and the number of nascent transcripts remain unchanged. Between the fifth and eighth h of release from butyrate, the number of nascent transcripts and the rate of total RNA synthesis increase to control cell levels. This increase in the number of nascent RNA polymerase complexes, while occurring when bulk histone is hypoacetylated, is temporally correlated with an increase in the rate of acetylation for a subset of histones. In contrast, changes in levels and rates of histone acetylation were found to be without effect on the average rate of RNA chain elongation. Additionally, we have found that the complexity of nuclear RNA is unchanged by a 20-h exposure of HTC cells to butyrate, suggesting that the approximately 40% decrease in frequency of nascent polymerase complexes produced by butyrate does not result from the complete loss of transcription of a large number of genes."

https://openalex.org/W200686081,"tide 2-26 was shown to inhibit combination of the biotiny1 subunit with the outside subunit and thus retard combination with the central subunit and to cause a decrease in the enzymatic activity when compared with untreated subunits. Peptide 1-14 had no effect, showing it did not compete for the binding site on the outside subunit. When the 12 Su subunit was treated with either peptide, there was inhibition of formation of active enzyme, showing that each bound to the site on the central subunit. These results indicate that, of sequence 2-26,2-14 binds to the central subunit and 15-26 to the outside subunit or portions thereof. It is proposed that some residues in the central portion of sequence 2-26 are not bound to either the central or outside subunits and that the variation in distance which is observed in electron micrographs of transcarboxylase between the central and outside subunits results from this flexible portion of the sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1590152938,"1-Bromopinacolone, BrPin, acts initially as a reversible competitive inhibitor for acetylcholinesterase, KI = 0.18 mM in hydrolysis of acetylcholine. Unlike bromoacetone, with time it acts as an irreversible covalent inhibitor. BrPin has a hydrolytic half-life of 30 h at the pH of incubation, 7.8. The enzyme-BrPin complex is 50% inactivated in 2 h. First order kinetics are observed; the rate constant is proportional to the concentration of complex. Retardation by cationic inhibitors of the inactivation is consistent with inactivation occurring as a result of binding of BrPin to the active site. Efficiency of irreversible inhibition by BrPin is essentially the same for hydrolysis of cationic and uncharged substrates, acetylcholine, 3,3-dimethylbutyl acetate, phenyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, and indophenyl acetate. In contrast, a cationic alkylating agent, N,N-dimethyl-2-phenylaziridinium ion, DPA, acts noncompetitively; it inactivates completely toward cationic, and partially toward uncharged substrates, and does so slightly more rapidly than BrPin, but less than would be commensurate with its greater intrinsic reactivity. Enzyme first treated with DPA is inactivated by BrPin toward hydrolysis of 3,3-dimethylbutyl acetate. It is proposed that BrPin, and not DPA, binds and reacts in, and may be a useful labeling agent for, the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1493839293,"In ureotelic species, such as the rat, adaptive changes in metabolic flux and enzyme levels occur in the purine metabolic pathway when cells are rapidly growing. This is observed in both regenerating liver and in malignant tissues. The enzymes P-Rib-PP amidotransferase and IMP dehydrogenase increase in activity in both situations. The level of purine biosynthesis is much higher in uricotelic species, such as the chick, when compared to ureotelic animals. By treating immature roosters with the hormone beta-estradiol, it is possible to induce rapid liver growth, allowing comparison of the regulation of purine biosynthesis and interconversion in high metabolic rate cells with different roles for purine metabolism. The tissue activities of P-Rib-PP amidotransferase, xanthine dehydrogenase, adenylosuccinate synthetase and lyase, AMP deaminase, IMP dehydrogenase, and GMP synthetase did not rise in livers from estradiol-treated chicks, as compared to controls. However, the rate of de novo purine synthesis triples and the intracellular level of P-Rib-PP doubles within 24 h of treatment. The biosynthesis of GMP is elevated at 12 and 24 h, but the levels of soluble nucleotide pools do not change. These data indicate that regulation of the de novo purine pathway in uricotelic species in a high metabolic situation is at the level of substrate availability (P-Rib-PP) and not due to changes in enzyme level or to feedback inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W1528008371,"Abstract Addition of oleoyl-CoA to incubations containing rat lung membranes and S-adenosyl [methyl-3H]methionine resulted in the formation of a previously unidentified nonpolar methylated lipid. The product was formed enzymatically, with an apparent Km for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) of about 0.3 microM and half-maximal activity using about 0.1 mM oleoyl-CoA. Activity was highest in microsomes but present in other membranous fractions, including plasma membranes from mature human erythrocytes. Intact red blood cells formed the nonpolar methylated lipid intracellularly upon incubation with [methyl-3H]methionine and oleoyl-CoA. Product formation differed among membranes from various tissues. The nonpolar methylated lipid was analyzed by TLC, high performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography with radiodetection. It was identified as S-methyl-N-oleoylmercaptoethylamide by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Products obtained from oleoyl-CoA or palmitoyl-CoA, incubated with nonradioactive or [methyl-14C]AdoMet, were compared using electron impact and/or chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Inferred structures were confirmed using authentic standards. The methylated product was apparently formed by tissue as follows: (a) cleavage of oleoyl-CoA by an amidase to form S-oleoylmercaptoethylamine; (b) spontaneous rearrangement to form N-oleoylmercaptoethylamide; and (c) enzymatic methylation of the free thiol by AdoMet. Participation of the amidase was suggested by the biosynthesis of the amide (free thiol) using [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA."
