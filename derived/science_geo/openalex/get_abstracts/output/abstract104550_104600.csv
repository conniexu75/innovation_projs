Genetic analyses in yeast indicate that binding of rapamycin to its intracellular receptor, FKBP12, generates a toxic complex that inhibits cell growth in G1 phase. These analyses implicated two related proteins, TOR1 and TOR2, as targets of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex in yeast. In this study, we have used a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FKBP12-rapamycin affinity matrix to isolate putative mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) from tissue extracts. In the presence of rapamycin, immobilized GST-FKBP12 specifically precipitates similar high molecular mass proteins from both rat brain and murine T-lymphoma cell extracts. Binding experiments performed with rapamycin-sensitive and -resistant mutant clones derived from the YAC-1 T-lymphoma cell line demonstrate that the GST-FKBP12-rapamycin complex recovers significantly lower amounts of the candidate mTOR from rapamycin-resistant cell lines. The latter results suggest that mTOR is a relevant target of rapamycin in these cells. Finally, we report the isolation of a full-length mTOR cDNA that encodes a direct ligand for the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The deduced amino acid sequence of mTOR displays 42 and 45% identity to those of yeast TOR1 and TOR2, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the FKBP12-rapamycin complex interacts with homologous ligands in yeast and mammalian cells and that the loss of mTOR function is directly related to the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on G1- to S-phase progression in T-lymphocytes and other sensitive cell types.

The structurally related macrolides, rapamycin and FK506, are potent immunosuppressants that inhibit signal transduction pathways required for T-cell activation and growth (for review, see (1Sigal N.H.

FK506 and rapamycin bind to a family of intracellular receptors termed FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs). The most well characterized member of the FKBP family is a 12-kDa isoform, FKBP12(4Siekierka J.J. Hung S.H.Y. Poe M. Lin C.S. Sigal N.H.

According to this model, the binding of rapamycin or FK506 to FKBP12 generates a toxic complex that interferes with a specific component of the intracellular signaling machinery. For example, the FKBP12•FK506 complex binds to and inhibits the Ca 2+ -calmodulin-regulated protein serine-threonine phosphatase, calcineurin(7Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar, 8Fruman D.A. Klee C.B. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, the FKBP12-rapamycin complex does not interact with calcineurin, and the molecular target(s) of this complex in lymphoid cells remains undefined. Rapamycin's inhibitory action on G1-phase progression in yeast (11Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar) parallels its anti-proliferative effect on IL-2-stimulated T-lymphocytes. Genetic studies in yeast may therefore provide clues regarding the mechanism of action of rapamycin in mammalian cells. As predicted from the gain-of-function model described above, disruption of the yeast FKB1 locus, which encodes FKBP12, yields viable cells that are resistant to rapamycin(11Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). A screen for additional rapamycin-resistant yeast mutants led to the discovery of two novel genes, TOR1 and TOR2(12Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 13Cafferkey R. Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Bergsma D.J. Koltin Y. Sathe G.M. Faucette L. Eng W.-K. Johnson R.K. Livi G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6012-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The TOR1 and TOR2 genes encode related proteins containing putative lipid kinase domains homologous to those found in both yeast and mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. Whether the FKBP12-rapamycin complex binds targets in mammalian cells that are homologous to the yeast TOR proteins remains an important but unsettled question. In this study, we have isolated from mammalian tissue extracts a high molecular mass protein that binds specifically to the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The amino acid sequence of this protein, which we have designated a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), suggests that it represents a mammalian homolog of the yeast TOR proteins. Furthermore, comparisons of rapamycin-sensitive and -resistant mutant subclones of a murine T-lymphoma cell line indicate that drug resistance is highly correlated with reduced binding of mTOR to the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. These studies strongly suggest that mTOR represents a relevant target of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex in T-lymphocytes. YAC-1 T-lymphoma cell lines were maintained in 10 mM Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 medium (pH 7.2) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mML-glutamine, and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol. The derivation of rapamycin-resistant and -sensitive YAC-1 subclones has been described previously(14Dumont F.J. Altmeyer A. Kastner C. Fischer P.A. Lemon K.P. Chung J. Blenis J. Staruch M.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 992-1003PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the open reading frame of human FKBP12 was cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX2T (Pharmacia). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain JM101. To produce the GST-FKBP12 fusion protein, one-liter cultures of transformed bacteria were grown at 37°C with shaking to an optical density (A600 ) of 0.8. The culture was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and the incubation was continued for an additional 3 h. The bacteria were harvested and lysed by sonication according to the protocol supplied with the pGEX2T vector. GST-FKBP12 was purified from the cleared bacterial extract by chromatography over a glutathione (GSH)-agarose column. The column was washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing 1% Triton X-100 (PBST), and the fusion protein was eluted with PBST containing 30 mM GSH. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed into PBS at 4°C. The purified GST-FKBP12 displayed FK506 binding and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activities equivalent to those observed with native FKBP12. Frozen rat brains were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN) and were homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY) in two volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 15 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM CaCl 2 1 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.4), containing 10% glycerol, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 14,500 × g, and the resulting supernatant was recentrifuged for 1 h at 140,000 × g. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by dropwise addition of saturated ammonium sulfate solution to a final concentration of 30% (v/v). Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation and were resolubilized in 2 ml of homogenization buffer/brain equivalent. YAC-1 cells (2 × 108 cells/sample) were harvested from culture medium, washed 2 times in PBS, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.4)) containing 50 μM digitonin and the protease inhibitor mixture described above. After 20 min on ice, the cells were lysed in an all-glass Dounce homogenizer. The hypotonic buffer was subsequently converted to brain homogenization buffer by the addition of the appropriate amounts of the solutes described above. All remaining steps in the preparation of T-cell extracts were identical to those described above. To prepare the affinity matrix, GST-FKBP12 (100 μg) was immobilized on 20 μl of GSH-coupled agarose beads. The beads were washed 4 times with homogenization buffer containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40. Brain or YAC-1 cell extracts (0.4-4 mg of protein/ml) were precleared with GSH-agarose loaded with GST-FKBP12. The cleared extracts were rotated for 1 h with immobilized GST-FKBP12 in the absence or presence of 10 μM rapamycin or FK506. The precipitates were washed 4 times with homogenization buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 2 × Laemmli sample buffer(15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and detected by silver staining (Bio-Rad). Preparative scale purification of the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding protein was carried out for amino acid sequence analysis. GST-FKBP12 was immobilized on GSH-agarose and incubated with brain extract (3-5 mg of protein) in the presence of 10 μM rapamycin as described above. After the batch adsorption step, the remaining supernatant was discarded, and a fresh aliquot of brain extract was added to the same tube. The serial adsorption process was repeated until approximately 20 mg of extract protein had been incubated with each aliquot of GST-FKBP12-coupled beads. The bound proteins were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE as described above. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were fixed and stained in 20% methanol, 0.5% glacial acetic acid containing 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Blue. Based on the staining intensities of the target protein-containing gel fragments relative to that of a known standard (rabbit skeletal muscle myosin), we estimate that approximately 6 μg of purified protein was submitted to the Mayo Peptide Synthesis and Protein Sequencing Facility for further analysis. The appropriate regions of the gel were excised, and the protein was subjected to in-gel digestion with modified sequencing grade trypsin (BoehringerMannheim)(16Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemont J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The tryptic peptides were injected onto 2.1 × 220-mm Aquapore 300 high performance liquid chromatography column (Applied Biosystems) and were eluted from the column at a solvent flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The initial eluting solvent was 1% solvent B (40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid) and 99% solvent A (5% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoracetic acid). After 8 min, a linear gradient to 10% solvent B was performed over 5 min. At 13 min, a second linear gradient to 100% solvent B was imposed over the next 67 min. The optical density of the eluate was monitored at 215 nm, and 0.1-ml fractions were collected. Amino acid microsequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Model 475A protein sequencer. Amino acid microsequencing yielded an unambiguous LELAVPG sequence that was also present in the yeast TOR proteins but not in any other known protein. To isolate the full-length cDNA encoding mTOR, primers based upon the LELAVPG sequence and upon regions of conservation between the yeast TOR proteins and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit were used to generate a PCR fragment that could be used to probe a cDNA library. The first set of four sense primers were degenerate 17-mers covering the amino acid sequence ELAVPG obtained from the purified protein. The primers were GAR YTN GCN GTN CCT GG, GAR YTN GCN GTN CCC GG, GAR YTN GCN GTN CCA GG, and GAR YTN GCN GTN CCG GG. The first set of three antisense primers covered the conserved amino acid sequence (I/F)HIDFG, from the yeast TOR proteins(12Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

The primers were: NCC RAA RTC (A/G/T)AT RTG AA, NCC RAA RTC (A/G/T)AT RTG GA, and NCC RAA RTC (A/G/T)AT RTG TA. The primers were used in PCR reactions in all 12 possible combinations with rat brain cDNA as the template and with Ultima Taq Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) as the polymerase. The PCR conditions were 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. The products of the first reaction were used as templates in a second PCR reaction to generate a nested product. The second set of four degenerate sense primers corresponded to the amino acid sequence (D/E)D(I/L)RQD(12Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

The primers were GAN GAY ATN CGN CAA GA, GAN GAY ATN CGN CAG GA, GAN GAY ATN AGN CAA GA, and GAN GAY ATN AGN CAG GA. The second set of four degenerate antisense primers covered the conserved sequence DRH(P/N)SN(12Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

Livi G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6012-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The four primers were (A/G)TT N(G/C) (A/T) N(G/T) (G/T) (A/G)TG NCG ATC, (A/G)TT N(G/C) (A/T) N(G/T) (G/T) (A/G)TG NCG GTC, (A/G)TT N(G/C) (A/T) N(G/T) (G/T) (A/G)TG NCT ATC, and (A/G)TT N(G/C) (A/T) N(G/T)(G/T) (A/G)TG NCT GTC. Sixteen independent PCR reactions were performed using 0.5 μl of each of the 12 initial PCR reaction products as templates (192 reactions total). Eleven reactions yielded products of the predicted size (about 450 base pairs), and these fragments were subcloned into pUC19 and sequenced. Of the eleven PCR products sequenced, one yielded a deduced amino acid sequence homologous to the yeast TOR proteins. That PCR product was labeled by random priming (Prime-It, Stratagene) with hexamers in the presence of [α- 32 P]dATP and was used to screen 1.2 million recombinant phage from an oligo(dT) and randomly primed rat brain cDNA library (Stratagene). Prehybridization, high stringency hybridization, and washing conditions were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Positive phage were plaque-purified, and the EcoRI cDNA inserts were excised from DNA purified from plate lysates of the cloned phage. The EcoRI cDNA inserts were subcloned into pUC19 and sequenced with either Sequenase or Taq polymerase on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer. Each strand was sequenced a minimum of 4 times each. A 7.1-kilobase pair partial cDNA was isolated from the first screen. After sequencing, EcoRI-linked primers were synthesized and used in a PCR reaction to isolate the first 450 base pairs in the 7.1-kilobase pair partial cDNA. The sense primer was GAA TTC ATG AAY CCN GCN TTT GT, and the antisense primer was GAA TTC GTN GKR TAR WAY TCG TC. The product was digested with EcoRI and subcloned into pUC19. The product was excised from EcoRI, labeled as described above, and used to rescreen the same library. Several clones were isolated that overlapped with the 5′ end of the 7.1-kilobase pair clone by as much as 4000 nucleotides and extended the sequence upstream by as much as 1500 nucleotides. Because the open reading frame (ORF) still extended to the 5′ end of the contiguous sequence, the remainder of the cDNA was isolated by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). The template was 5′ Race-Ready rat brain cDNA (Clontech). The 5′ anchor primer was supplied by the manufacturer. The antisense primers corresponding to the rat mTOR gene were GAA TTC CCA CCT TCC ACT CCA ATG for the primary reaction and GAA TTC CAT ATG CTT GGG ACA GGC CCT GCC ACG in the secondary PCR reaction. Sequencing of the RACE products demonstrated that we had obtained the remainder of the ORF. The 7.1-kilobase pair mTOR cDNA clone was excised from pUC19 by digestion with EcoRI, and the gel-purified insert was cloned into the EcoRI site of pSP72 (Promega). A recombinant pSP72 plasmid containing the 7.1-kilobase pair cDNA in the proper orientation relative to the T7 RNA polymerase promoter site was identified by restriction mapping and purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. The cDNA was transcribed and translated in the presence of [ 35 35 S]methionine using the TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). One-tenth volume (5 μl) of the translation reaction was denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The remainder of the translation reaction was diluted with homogenization buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The diluted sample was divided into aliquots and incubated with GSH-agarose-bound fusion proteins in the absence or presence of rapamycin or FK506, and protein-binding assays were performed as described above. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were treated with EN3HANCE (DuPont NEN), and the 35 35 S-labeled translation products were detected by fluorography at −70°C. Our strategy for the detection of rapamycin-FKBP12 ligands was based on the affinity purification technique previously employed for the identification of calcineurin as an intracellular target for the FK506•FKBP12 complex(7Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar). Tissue extracts were incubated with GSH-agarose-coupled GST-FKBP12 in the absence or presence of rapamycin or FK506, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1, rapamycin-loaded GST-FKBP12 precipitated a high molecular mass (>200 kDa) protein from rat brain extracts. The interaction of this protein with GST-FKBP12 was specifically dependent on the presence of rapamycin, as the protein was not found in precipitates prepared without drug or with FK506. As predicted, the GST-FKBP12•FK506 complex recovered relatively abundant 57- and 61-kDa proteins corresponding to known isoforms of the calcineurin A subunit(7Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3546) Google Scholar). Both the calcineurin B subunit (15 kDa) and calmodulin (17 kDa) were also evident when the latter precipitates were electrophoresed through higher percentage acrylamide gels (data not shown). The results described above prompted additional studies to determine whether similar FKBP12-rapamycin binding proteins were expressed in T-lymphocytes. Earlier reports documented that rapamycin inhibits both the proliferation and the cytokine responsiveness of the murine T-lymphoma cell line, YAC-1(17Dumont F.J. Melino M.R. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.L.

Cytokine. 1993; 5: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), indicating that YAC-1 cells express a functionally important target of rapamycin. The results in Fig. 2 depict a comparison of the proteins recovered from rat brain and YAC-1 cell extracts by the GST-FKBP12-rapamycin complex. In the presence of rapamycin, the immobilized GST-FKBP12 specifically precipitated proteins with similar electrophoretic mobilities from both YAC-1 cell and rat brain extracts. Henceforth, these high molecular mass binding proteins will be provisionally designated as mTOR. Interestingly, the GST-FKBP12-rapamycin precipitates from YAC-1 cells contained two high molecular mass proteins, with the lower band co-migrating with mTOR isolated from rat brain. The recovery of the higher molecular mass species from different YAC-1 cell extracts appeared to correlate with that of the lower band (see Fig. 3), suggesting that these are either posttranslationally modified versions of the same protein or that the upper band represents a distinct protein whose interaction with the FKBP12-rapamycin complex is contingent on the binding of mTOR.Figure 3:Recovery of mTOR from wild-type and mutant YAC-1 clones. Left panel shows equivalent amounts of extract (0.45 mg of protein/sample) from wild-type (WT) YAC-1 cells, and the mutant clones R103 (103), R125 (125), 4R16, and 10R13 were precipitated with GST-FKBP12 in the absence(-) or presence (+) of 10 μM rapamycin (RAP). Bound proteins were separated and visualized as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Doublearrow on right indicates the location of mTOR. Right panel shows extracts that were prepared from rat brain, wild-type (WT) YAC-1 cells, a rapamycin-sensitive revertant subclone derived from R19 (R19rev ), and the original, rapamycin-resistant R19 clone (R19or ). Recovery of mTOR was determined as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recent studies characterized a panel of rapamycin-resistant and -sensitive clones derived from the YAC-1 T-lymphoma cell line(14Dumont F.J. Altmeyer A. Kastner C. Fischer P.A. Lemon K.P. Chung J. Blenis J. Staruch M.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 992-1003PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant clones were generated by treatment of YAC-1 cells with ethylmethanesulfonate, followed by limiting dilution cloning in rapamycincontaining culture medium. Clonal populations were selected for resistance to the antiproliferative effect of rapamycin. Further characterization of these clones revealed that several (R19, 4R16, and 10R13) displayed a stable, drug-resistant phenotype, whereas others (R103, R125) were fully sensitive to rapamycin in short term cultures. The three rapamycin-resistant clones expressed normal amounts of FKBP12 and retained wild-type levels of sensitivity to FK506, suggesting that the resistant phenotype was due to an alteration located downstream of FKBP12(14Dumont F.J. Altmeyer A. Kastner C. Fischer P.A. Lemon K.P. Chung J. Blenis J. Staruch M.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 992-1003PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy to the previously described yeast TOR mutants(11Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar, 12Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U.

Faucette L. Eng W.-K. Johnson R.K. Livi G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6012-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), we reasoned that one or more of the rapamycin-resistant YAC-1 clones might express mutant mTOR with altered binding to the GST-FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The silver-stained gel shown in Fig. 3, left panel, compares the recoveries of mTOR from wild-type (WT) YAC-1 cells, and rapamycin-sensitive (R103, R125) or -resistant (4R16, 10R13) clones. The immobilized GST-FKBP12-rapamycin complexes precipitated mTOR from both of the rapamycin-sensitive clones, R103 and R125, at levels comparable with those obtained from wild-type cells. In contrast, substantially lower levels of mTOR were consistently precipitated from the rapamycin-resistant clones 4R16 and 10R13. These results indicated that the reduced recovery of mTOR by the GST-FKBP12-rapamycin complex was correlated with the rapamycin-resistant phenotype in the mutant YAC-1 clones (see “Discussion”). The correlation between decreased binding of mTOR to the FKBP12-rapamycin complex and resistance to rapamycin was further substantiated by studies performed with a spontaneous revertant of the rapamycin-resistant R19 clone. After over 6 months in culture medium without rapamycin, a stock culture of R19 cells was found to express an increased level of sensitivity to rapamycin. A drug-sensitive revertant clone, designated R19rev , was subsequently isolated from this variant population. Binding experiments revealed that the GST-FKBP12-rapamycin complex consistently precipitated a higher amount of mTOR from R19rev cells than from parental, rapamycin-resistant R19 cells (Fig. 3, right panel). Thus, the reacquisition of rapamycin sensitivity in the R19rev clone was accompanied by an increase in the amount of mTOR precipitated by the GST-FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The observation that little or no mTOR binds to the FKBP12-rapamycin complex in the rapamycin-resistant YAC-1 mutants strongly suggested that mTOR is a relevant target of rapamycin in mammalian cells. The yeast TOR1 and TOR2 genes had been cloned genetically from rapamycin-resistant yeast strains by their ability to confer rapamycin resistance to wild-type strains. The high molecular masses of both the yeast TOR gene products and purified mTOR suggested that mTOR might be a mammalian counterpart to yeast TOR1 and TOR2. We therefore hypothesized that mTOR might be related to the proteins encoded by yeast TOR1 and TOR2. To confirm this, the cDNA encoding rat mTOR was isolated from a rat brain cDNA library. In order to clone the cDNA, mTOR was purified from rat brain as described previously and digested with trypsin, and the resulting tryptic peptides were subjected to amino acid sequencing. One of the peptides yielded an unambiguous heptapeptide sequence, LELAVPG. This heptapeptide is 100% identical to an amino acid sequence found in both the yeast TOR1 and TOR2 proteins(12Kunz J.

Nineteen sites have been identified; all but Ser-262 are localized to the amino- and carboxyl-terminal flanking regions of the microtubule-binding domain. Eleven sites correspond to fetal type sites. Unexpectedly, 10 are non-proline-directed, whereas the others are proline-directed. Thus, the abnormal phosphorylation of PHF-tau can be considered to consist of fetal type phosphorylation and additional proline-directed and non-proline-directed phosphorylation. This non-fetal type phosphorylation may provide PHF-tau with the unusual characteristics.

Their abundance is reported to be correlated with the clinical degree of dementia (1Arriagada P.V. Growdon J.H. Hedley-Whyte E.T. Hyman B.T.

In contrast to β-amyloid that is currently believed to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of AD (for reviews see Refs. 4 and 5), the tangle formation is a late event (6Mann D.M.A. Neurobiol.

Paired helical filaments (PHF), unit fibrils of the neurofibrillary tangle, have an unusual morphology. They are apparently composed of two 10-nm filaments wound around each other, giving a half-periodicity of 80 nm. This kind of unusual fiber has never been observed in other mammals, including nonhuman primates, and is unique to humans. PHF also show unusual biochemical characteristics: insolubility and remarkable resistance to proteases, which prevented their extensive biochemical analysis for a long time. It was only 6 years ago that SDS-insoluble PHF were clearly shown to be composed of tau, a microtubule-associated protein (7Kondo J. Honda T. Mori H. Hamada Y. Miura R. Ogawara R. Ihara Y.

PHF undergo chemical evolution in situ; PHF at their late stage are SDS-insoluble and composed of the carboxyl third of tau and ubiquitin(7Kondo J. Honda T. Mori H. Hamada Y. Miura R. Ogawara R.

PHF-tau is characterized by (i) an unusually slow mobility on SDS-PAGE, (ii) loss of the tubulin assembly-promoting activity, and (iii) normalization of these two parameters by dephosphorylation(18Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Schein J.D. Binder L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 564-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lu Q. Wood J.G. J.

Consistent with this, we were unable to detect any abnormal modification in PHF-tau other than phosphorylation; N α -acetylation at the amino terminus and deamidation at some asparaginyl residues found in PHF-tau are also present in normal tau(21Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possible scenario in the PHF formation is as follows. A certain protein kinase(s) activated or up-regulated during AD phosphorylates tau to such an extent that it loses the affinity for microtubules, which in turn are destabilized(22Alonso A.C. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Because of its negligible affinity for tubulin, PHF-tau molecules would interact with each other, probably at the microtubule-binding domain to form dimers and finally PHF(17Ksiezak-Reding H. Yen S.-H. Neuron. 1991; 6: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). According to this scheme, identification of the involved protein kinase(s) and also its counteracting protein phosphatase(s) (25Goedert M. Cohen E.S. Jakes R. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 26Drewes G. Mandelkow E.-M. Baumann K. Goris J. Merlevede W. Mandelkow E.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) is of primary importance, because this perturbation in the phosphorylation cascade initiates successive biochemical events leading to PHF formation and simultaneously brings about the microenvironmental alterations that cause tangle-bearing neurons to degenerate. For this reason, many investigators have been concerned about the nature of PHF-tau phosphorylation and thus the potentially involved protein kinases and/or protein phosphatases. Although the unambiguous determination of the in vivo phosphorylation sites should be the first step toward addressing the above issue, to date only a few sites have been definitely identified as abnormal phosphorylation sites: Thr-231, Ser-235, and Ser-262, with the last being only partially phosphorylated (21Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (the numbering is according to a 441-residue human tau isoform; (28Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar)). We previously found that PHF-tau is highly phosphorylated in the tau 1 portion (29Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Binder L. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Lee G. Neuron. 1988; 1: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and carboxyl-terminal portion outside the binding domain but failed to determine the exact phosphorylation sites(21Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two portions were not effectively subjected to protein chemical analyses because (i) both, relatively large peptides, provide no significant mass spectral signals, unless dephosphorylated; (ii) they are unusually resistant to proteases; and (iii) smaller phosphopeptides, even if generated, are not or are only poorly recovered from HPLC columns (see (21Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Consequently, several likely phosphorylation sites have been postulated solely on an immunochemical basis using phosphorylation-dependent PHF monoclonals and mutated recombinant tau(30Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Schröter C. Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Steiner B. Berling B. Meyer H. Mercken M. Vandermeeren A. Goedert M. Mandelkow E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1593-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 31Lichtenberg-Kraag B. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Steiner B. Schröter C. Gustke N. Meyer H.E. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5066-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, this approach invariably leaves some ambiguity regarding the exact sites, and furthermore, entirely depends on the available phosphorylation-dependent PHF monoclonals; it is quite possible that there exist some/many abnormal phosphorylation sites left unrecognized by a panel of PHF monoclonals. Because of this, we have been attempting to overcome the difficulties in applying the protein chemical procedures to the two highly phosphorylated portions in PHF-tau. Here we show that the two portions of PHF-tau are phosphorylated on non-proline-directed sites as well as proline-directed sites. PHF-tau was purified essentially as described previously(21Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Sarkosyl pellets were suspended in a small volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and dissolved with 6 M guanidine HCl for further purification. The guanidine HCl suspension was centrifuged at 450,000 × g for 30 min in a CS-120 microcentrifuge (Hitachi). The supernatants were treated with iodoacetate after reduction and fractionated on TSK gel G-3000 SWXL columns (7.8 × 300 mm × 2; Tosoh) arrayed in tandem equilibrated with 6 M guanidine HCl in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The TSK fractions containing PHF-tau were further purified on an Aquapore RP-300 column (2.1 × 30 mm, Applied Biosystems) by HPLC (Hewlett-Packard model 1090M), which was developed with a linear gradient of 20-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid in 10 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. On several occasions, the Sarkosyl pellets were prepared in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors including 50 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM KF, 50 mM imidazole, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 100 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 2 μM okadaic acid. Crude PHF-tau for immunoblotting was prepared according to the method of Greenberg and Davies (14Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The supernatant of brain homogenates after centrifugation at 27,200 × g was brought to 1% Sarkosyl and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 35 min and suspended in 0.7% formic acid, and the suspension was heated to 100°C for 5 min. After centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatant were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Fetal (rat) tau was purified from 1-day-old rat brains according to the protocol described previously(7Kondo J. Honda T. Mori H. Hamada Y. Miura R. Ogawara R. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1988; 1: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The supernatants prepared from neonatal brain homogenates were fractionated with ammonium sulfate (33-50%) and heated to 90°C for 5 min. After centrifugation, cleared supernatants were applied onto a phosphocellulose (P11, Whatman) column, and after being washed with 0.1 M NaCl, crude fetal tau was eluted with 0.3 M NaCl. Crude fetal tau was further purified as described above. Appropriate amounts of highly purified PHF-tau were digested with Achromobacter lyticus protease I at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) at 37°C overnight. A. lyticus protease I peptides were fractionated on a Superspher RP-Select B column (2 × 119 mm, Merck) with a gradient of 0-48% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 24 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Those fractions containing tau 1 and carboxyl-terminal portions (21Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were pooled and subjected to further digestion with other proteases. The tau 1 portion was further digested with immobilized trypsin (Pierce) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:2 to ~ 1:5. The digest was fractionated on the same column with a gradient of 0-32% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 16 min. Each fraction was subjected to amino acid sequencing after ethanethiol modification and ion spray mass spectrometry (ISMS). The carboxyl-terminal portion was cleaved with Pseudomonas fragi endoproteinase AspN (1:10; Boehringer Mannheim) and then with immobilized trypsin (1:1 to 1:10). The digest was fractionated as above with the same gradient in 32 min and subjected to further analysis. Fractionated peptides were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer equipped with an on-line 120A PTH Analyzer or on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Mass spectral analysis was performed by ISMS on a PE-SCIEX API III biomolecular mass analyzer (triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer) equipped with a standard atmospheric pressure ion source, as described previously(21Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For unknown reasons, highly phosphorylated peptides that were confirmed by sequencing often gave no significant ISMS signals. For certain phosphopeptides, collision mass spectra were obtained. In this manner Ser-396, −400, −409, and −422 were determined as the phosphorylation sites (see Table 1).Tabled 1 Phosphopeptides were subjected to sequence analysis after conversion to S-ethylcysteine peptides(33Meyer H.E. Hottmann-Posorske E. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, no peak corresponding to S-ethylcysteine was observed either by the modification of nonphosphorylated counterparts or in the cycles other than in the position of phosphoserine. Related to this, it should be noted that an amino-terminally located phosphoserine cannot be identified as S-ethylcysteine(33Meyer H.E. Hottmann-Posorske E. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Phosphothreonine was indirectly assigned when (i) a particular phosphopeptide (determined by ISMS) contained the Ser or Thr residue; (ii) in the cycle at Thr, PTH-threonine yield was unusually poor as compared with that from the nonphosphorylated counterpart; and (iii) the assignment was compatible with ISMS data if available(34Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following phosphopeptides were synthesized and conjugated with KLH through amino- or carboxyl-terminal cysteine (Fujiya Bioscience Lab, Kanagawa): SPRHLS(P)NVSSTC, CGGHLSNVSS(P)TGSID, CGGRSRTPS(P)LPTPP, and CGGIDMVDS(P)PQLAT, where S(P) represents phosphoserine. One mg (as peptide) of each immunogen was injected into a rabbit, which received every 2 weeks 0.5 mg of immunogen as booster starting from 4 weeks after the first immunization. The titers of antisera were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and rabbits were bled; the obtained antisera were designated AP409, AP413, AP214, and AP422, corresponding to the above four peptides, respectively. AP413, AP214, and AP422 were phosphopeptide-specific, whereas AP409 was reactive with both phospho- and nonphosphopeptides. AP409 became phosphopeptide-specific by passing through a nonphosphopeptide-immobilized column. Each antiserum was reactive with a phosphopeptide used as immunogen but not with three other phosphopeptides. Other antibodies used were M4 and C5, which most likely recognize the phosphorylation on Thr-231 and Ser-396, respectively(35Hasegawa M. Watanabe A. Takio K. Suzuki M. Arai T. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2068-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described(13Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We previously showed that two PHF polyclonals and two PHF monoclonals, both of which are phosphorylation-dependent and have distinct specificities, exclusively or preferentially label fetal tau but hardly act on adult tau(35Hasegawa M. Watanabe A. Takio K. Suzuki M. Arai T. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2068-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Kanemaru K. Takio K. Miura R. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because fetal tau is much easier to analyze, we first determined the in vivo phosphorylation sites of fetal tau(34Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results indicate that (i) the tau 1 portion of fetal tau is phosphorylated on four Ser/Thr sites at most, and its carboxyl-terminal portion on five sites; and (ii) of 12 phosphorylation sites 8 are proline-directed and 4 are non-proline-directed (see Fig. 4; (34Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). 2M. Morishima-Kawashima, M. Hasegawa, K. Takio, M. Suzuki, H. Yoshida, K. Titani, and Y. Ihara, unpublished observation. We investigated and established the appropriate conditions under which the two portions from PHF-tau are effectively and, most importantly, reproducibly cleaved off. The tau 1 portion from PHF-tau was almost completely refractory to chymotrypsin, prolylendopeptidase, and pepsin even at high enzyme-substrate ratios. The carboxyl-terminal portion was also unusually resistant to trypsin, pepsin, AspN, and V8 protease. After trial and error, we found that (i) the tau 1 portion can be cleaved with immobilized trypsin; and (ii) the carboxyl-terminal portion generates phosphopeptides upon digestion with a high ratio of AspN followed by immobilized trypsin. Under these cleavage conditions, these two portions have been successfully digested and recovered. The choice of proteases for these portions differs from that for fetal tau (see (34Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)); the two portions from PHF-tau are far more resistant to proteases (data not shown). The peptide maps clearly show great differences between PHF-tau and fetal (rat) tau (Fig. 1, A-D), whereas the primary structures in the tau 1 and carboxyl-terminal portions are identical except for 1 residue, Asp-193 in PHF-tau for Glu in fetal rat tau(37Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Bakalis S. Neve R.L. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1389-1397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The tau 1 map from PHF-tau and, to a lesser extent, the carboxyl-terminal map are characterized by the presence of poorly separated, broad peaks and very poor recovery from the HPLC column (Fig. 1, A and B). Since by dephosphorylation those portions can be easily digested with proteases, and generated peptides elute in distinct peaks (data not shown), the HPLC profiles strongly suggest that both tau 1 and carboxyl-terminal portions of PHF-tau are more phosphorylated than those in fetal tau; such excess phosphorylation most likely prevents specific cleavage, which provides an apparently distinct HPLC profile. Poor separation of generated peptides presumably reflects incomplete digestion and heterogeneous phosphorylation of those portions (see below). The HPLC fractions containing phosphopeptides were identified by the extra mass number of n × 80 by ISMS (see Table 1), and the phosphorylation sites were determined by the method of S-ethylcysteine modification(33Meyer H.E. Hottmann-Posorske E. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PHF-tau purified from three different AD brains provided very similar HPLC profiles for tau 1 and carboxyl-terminal portions. We isolated ~ 15 phosphopeptides from each of the tau 1 and carboxyl-terminal portions (Table 1). Peak 8 from the tau 1 portion of PHF-tau contained two phosphopeptides, peptides 195-221 and 210-221 (Table 1). The former peptide specific for PHF-tau was generated because of the failure of cleavage at the carboxyl sides of the two arginyl residues. The peaks for PTH-S-ethylcysteine were present in the 4th, 5th, 8th, 14th, 16th, and 20th Edman degradation cycles (data not shown; see Table 1). This indicated that Ser-198, −202, −208, −210, and −214 in peptide 195-221 are phosphorylated. PTH-S-ethylcysteine in the fifth cycle does not distinguish between Ser-199 in peptide 195-221 and Ser-214 in peptide 210-221. In this regard, the sequencing of peak 5 was informative, showing that Ser-199 is also phosphorylated (Table 1). In the third and eighth cycles of peak 8, PTH-threonine yield was unusually poor (data not shown; Table 1), suggesting that Thr-212 and −217 in peptide 210-221 are phosphorylated. This is also supported by ISMS; peptide 210-221 should carry four phosphates, which should be assigned to Ser-210, Ser-214, Thr-212, Thr-217, or Thr-220. Regarding the carboxyl-terminal portion, ISMS (and sequencing) of peaks 1 and 3 indicated that Ser-396, Ser-400, Thr-403, and Ser-404 are phosphorylated (Table 1). By sequencing of peak 7 (not detected by ISMS), PTH-S-ethylcysteine was identifiable in the third, sixth, and seventh degradation cycles, indicating that Ser-409, −412, and −413 are phosphorylated. Sequencing of peak 19 provided PTH-S-ethylcysteine in the second cycle, and thus Ser-422 is also phosphorylated. Overall, Ser-198, −199, −202, −208, −210, and −214 in the tau 1 portion were assigned to probable phosphorylation sites and Thr-212 and −217 to possible sites (Table 1; Fig. 2). Likewise, in the carboxyl-terminal portion, Ser-396, Ser-400, Thr-403, Ser-404, Ser-409, Ser-412, Ser-413, and Ser-422 were assigned to probable sites. Since Thr-231, Ser-235, and Ser-262 are also the sites for abnormal phosphorylation(21Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PHF-tau is phosphorylated on 19 Ser/Thr sites at most; 10 sites are located in the amino-terminal flanking region of the microtubule-binding domain and eight sites in the carboxyl-terminal flanking region. Nine sites are proline-directed, whereas the others are non-proline-directed. Eleven phosphorylation sites including Ser-198, Ser-199, Ser-202, Thr-217, Thr-231, Ser-235, Ser-396, Ser-400, Ser-404, Ser-409, and Ser-413 are indeed shared by fetal tau (see Fig. 4; (34Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)),2 which provides a rationale for the immunochemical similarities between PHF-tau and fetal tau(35Hasegawa M. Watanabe A. Takio K. Suzuki M. Arai T. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2068-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Kanemaru K. Takio K. Miura R. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A minor fraction of Thr-181, that is phosphorylated in fetal tau (34Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) appeared to be phosphorylated, but its extent was almost the same as that in normal tau (data not shown). PHF-tau-specific phosphorylation sites that are not found in fetal tau include Ser-208, Ser-210, Thr-212, Ser-214, Ser-262, Thr-403, Ser-412, and Ser-422, with two sites, Thr-212 and Ser-422, being proline-directed and the remaining six being non-proline-directed. To confirm the above, we raised several phosphorylation-site-specific antibodies and examined them immunochemically (Fig. 3). AP214, AP409, AP413, and AP422 were raised against synthetic peptides carrying phosphoserine 214, 409, 413, and 422, respectively. AP214 stained many neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaque neurites but few curly fibers. The others intensely stained all three PHF-containing structures as well (data not shown). On the immunoblot, AP409 and AP413 labeled both fetal tau and PHF-tau (and smear), as expected, whereas AP422 labeled only PHF-tau but not fetal tau (Fig. 3). AP214 reacted only faintly with fetal tau or PHF-tau (data not shown). This may suggest that Ser-214 is a very minor site for phosphorylation. Also it is possible that the extent of phosphorylation at Ser-214 varies greatly from case to case or is profoundly affected by postmortem dephosphorylation (see below). It should be noted that the above Ser/Thr sites are not necessarily uniformly phosphorylated among PHF-tau molecules (Table 1). Major phosphorylation sites are Ser-198, Ser-199, Ser-202, Thr-231, Ser-235, Ser-396, Ser-404, Ser-409, Ser-413, and Ser-422; a trace or only a small amount of nonphosphorylated counterparts for those sites were detected. Other sites appear not to be completely phosphorylated because their nonphosphorylated counterparts were always detected among other HPLC fractions (Table 1). Peptide 195-209 bears one to four or more covalently bound phosphates (Table 1). The monophosphorylated peptide 195-209 could be a mixture of three different peptides phosphorylated on Ser-198, Ser-199, or Ser-202 (peak 7 in Table 1; see also (34Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The heterogeneity in the phosphorylation varies to some extent from case to case (data not shown). However, regarding the extent of phosphorylation on a given site, even on fetal type sites, PHF-tau is much more phosphorylated than fetal tau; for instance, Thr-231 and Ser-396 in fetal tau are phosphorylated ~ 30% (see also (34Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The above observation raises the possibility that these partially phosphorylated Ser/Thr sites were originally completely phosphorylated but dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases"

To explore the specificity of arrestin-receptor interaction, we have characterized the ability of various wild-type arrestins to bind to rhodopsin, the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), and the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (m2 mAChR). Visual arrestin was found to be the most selective arrestin since it discriminated best between the three different receptors tested (highest binding to rhodopsin) as well as between the phosphorylation and activation state of the receptor (>10-fold higher binding to the phosphorylated light-activated form of rhodopsin compared to any other form of rhodopsin). While β-arrestin and arrestin 3 were also found to preferentially bind to the phosphorylated activated form of a given receptor, they only modestly discriminated among the three receptors tested. To explore the structural characteristics important in arrestin function, we constructed a series of truncated and chimeric arrestins. Analysis of the binding characteristics of the various mutant arrestins suggests a common molecular mechanism involved in determining receptor binding selectivity. Structural elements that contribute to arrestin binding include: 1) a C-terminal acidic region that serves a regulatory role in controlling arrestin binding selectivity toward the phosphorylated and activated form of a receptor, without directly participating in receptor interaction; 2) a basic N-terminal domain that directly participates in receptor interaction and appears to serve a regulatory role via intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal acidic region; and 3) two centrally localized domains that are directly involved in determining receptor binding specificity and selectivity. A comparative structure-function model of all arrestins and a kinetic model of β-arrestin and arrestin 3 interaction with receptors are proposed.

Many cells have the ability to rapidly regulate their responsiveness to external stimuli. This phenomenon, often termed desensitization, has been extensively studied in signaling pathways initiated by G protein-coupled receptors. Two of the best studied G protein-coupled receptors are rhodopsin, which mediates phototransduction in retinal rod cells, and the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR)1, which stimulates cAMP production in many tissues. The molecular events underlying desensitization of rhodopsin and the β2AR include a rapid activation-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor mediated by the specific G protein-coupled receptor kinases rhodopsin kinase (1Shichi H. Somers R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7040-7046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) (2Benovic J.L. Strasser R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), respectively. Receptor phosphorylation then promotes the binding of another protein to the receptor. This protein has been termed S-antigen or arrestin in the phototransduction system while in the β2AR system a related protein termed β-arrestin has been implicated. The binding of arrestin to the phosphorylated receptor appears to play the primary role in quenching signal transduction via its apparent ability to directly decrease receptor/G protein coupling (3Bennett N.

Recent studies suggest that at least three of the mammalian arrestins may also be represented by multiple polypeptide variants(10Sterne-Marr R. Gurevich V.V. Goldsmith P. Bodine R.C. Sanders C.

These variants include a form of β-arrestin, βarrS, that lacks 8 amino acids found in the originally identified bovine brain β-arrestin (βarr)(5Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 10Sterne-Marr R. Gurevich V.V. Goldsmith P. Bodine R.C. Sanders C. Donoso L.A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the 8 amino acids that distinguish these two forms of β-arrestin are encoded by exon 13 in the human visual arrestin gene(18Yamaki K. Tsuda M. Kikuchi T. Chen K.H. Huang K.P. Shinohara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20757-20762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While a similar variant may also exist for visual arrestin(16Parruti G. Peracchia F. Sallese M. Ambrosini G. Masini M. Rotilio D. DeBlasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9753-9761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a variant that has an alanine in place of the C-terminal 35 amino acids has also been identified(17Smith W.C. Milam A.H. Dugger D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15407-15410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a form of arrestin 3 (arr3L) that contains an 11-amino acid insert between residues 361 and 362 has also been identified(10Sterne-Marr R. Gurevich V.V. Goldsmith P. Bodine R.C. Sanders C. Donoso L.A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15640-15648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While the predominant form of βarr varies between tissues and arr3S is the predominant form of arr3 in most tissues, little is presently known about the functional significance of these polypeptide variants. The tremendous diversity of the G protein-coupled receptors, as compared to the more limited number of G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins, raises obvious questions concerning the receptor specificity of the various G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins. Here we have compared the ability of visual arrestin, βarr, βarrS, arr3L, and arr3S to bind to four different functional forms (phosphorylated, phosphorylated and agonist activated, unphosphorylated, and unphosphorylated and agonist activated) of three functionally distinct receptors: rhodopsin, the β2AR, and the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (m2 mAChR). We have utilized these receptors since they each have been demonstrated to undergo an activation-dependent phosphorylation both in vitro and in intact cells(2Benovic J.L. Strasser R.H. Caron M.G.

First, do other members of the arrestin family use the same sequential multisite binding mechanism as does visual arrestin? In addition, what domains of the arrestin molecule determine its receptor specificity and what structural elements of arrestins and receptors are involved? In an attempt to address these questions we have utilized two strategies of mutagenesis. First, several truncated forms of βarr and arr3, analogous to the previously characterized truncated forms of visual arrestin (arr)(25Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were produced and functionally characterized. This approach allowed us to establish a similar localization of the major functional domains in all arrestin proteins and suggested that the molecular mechanisms involved in their binding may also be similar. These findings set the stage for the construction of a series of arr/βarr chimeras. In constructing the chimeric arrestins we attempted to divide the arrestins into the four functional domains previously identified in visual arrestin(25Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Plasmids encoding chimeric arrestins were constructed as follows. pBBBA and pAAAB were obtained by exchange of 350- and 377-bp BstXI-HindIII fragments of pARR and pBARR, respectively. pBAAA and pABBB were constructed by exchange of 1225- and 1274-bp BamHI/HindIII fragments of pARR and pBARR, respectively. pBAAB and pABBA were constructed by subcloning 1252- and 1247-bp BamHI/HindIII fragments of pAAAB and pBBBA, respectively, into BamHI/HindIII digested pBARR and pARR, respectively. pBBAA and pAABB were constructed by exchange of 730-and 786-bp BglII/HindIII fragments of pARR and pBARR, respectively. pABAA and pBABB were obtained by subcloning 1218- and 1300-bp BamHI/HindIII fragments of BBAA and AABB, respectively, into BamHI/HindIII-digested pARR and pBARR, respectively. pBBAB and pAABA were constructed by subcloning 377- and 350-bp BstXI/HindIII fragments of pBARR and pARR, respectively, into BstXI/HindIII-digested pBBAA and pAABB, respectively. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (the structures of the resulting proteins are schematically shown in Fig. 4). Plasmids were linearized with HindIII before in vitro transcription to obtain full-length mRNAs. To obtain truncated mRNAs, pARR and pBAAA were linearized with StuI to obtain mRNAs encoding arr(1-191) and BAAA(1-187); pBARR and pABBB were linearized with HindII to obtain mRNAs encoding βarr(1-217) and ABBB(1-221); pBARR was linearized with either BglII or AspHI to obtain mRNAs encoding βarr(1-206) and βarr(1-367), respectively; while pARR3S was linearized with either PvuII or SfuI to obtain mRNAs encoding arr3(1-183) and arr3S(1-375), respectively. In vitro transcription and translation was carried out as described previously(25Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Urea-treated rod outer segment membranes were prepared, phosphorylated with βARK, and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal as described(26Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of phosphorylation for the rhodopsin preparation used in these studies was 2.4 mol of phosphate/mol of rhodopsin. The human m2 mAChR was expressed in Sf9 cells, purified by affinity chromatography, and reconstituted into chick heart phospholipid vesicles as described previously(23Richardson R.M. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reconstituted m2 mAChRs were phosphorylated with βARK to a stoichiometry of 2.8-3.7 mol of phosphate/mol of m2 mAChR as described previously(24Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both human and hamster β2AR were expressed in Sf9 cells, purified by affinity chromatography, reconstituted into soybean phosphatidylcholine vesicles, and phosphorylated by βARK to stoichiometries of 2.4-4.5 mol of phosphate/mol of β2AR as described previously(28Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the receptors was achieved with room light for rhodopsin, 100 μM(-)-isoproterenol for the β2AR, and 100 μM carbachol for the m2 mAChR. The basis of the arrestin/receptor binding assay was to assess a change in the mobility of an arrestin on a gel filtration column upon binding to the receptor. To study binding to rhodopsin, the in vitro translated [3H]arrestins were incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM potassium acetate with 7.5 pmol of the various functional forms of rhodopsin in a volume of 50 μl for 5 min at 37°C either in the dark or in room light. The samples were then cooled on ice and under dim red light were loaded onto a 2-ml Sepharose 2B column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA (buffer A). Bound arrestin eluted with the rod outer segments in the void volume (between 0.5 and 1.1 ml). To study binding of the arrestins to the m2 mAChR or β2AR, 200 fmol of the receptor (phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated) were incubated for 50 min at 30°C in a 50-μl reaction with 50 fmol of the respective [3H]arrestin and 100 μM of either the respective antagonist (atropine or alprenolol) or agonist (carbachol or isoproterenol) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM potassium acetate, 0.5 mM MgCl2 (and 0.2 mM dithiothreitol for the mAChR). The samples were then cooled on ice and loaded onto a 2-ml Sepharose 2B column equilibrated with buffer A. The columns were washed with 0.5 ml of buffer A and the phospholipid vesicles containing the receptor and bound arrestin were then eluted with 0.6 ml of buffer A. When saturation isotherms were prepared, samples contained 50 fmol of phosphorylated m2 mAChR or β2AR, 100 μM of the appropriate ligand, and various concentrations of the arrestins. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 0.3-1 μg of control liposomes and did not exceed 15% of the total binding. For all of the arrestin binding experiments the nonspecific binding was subtracted. In an effort to further characterize the interaction of arrestins with G protein-coupled receptors, we have studied the binding of in vitro translated arrestin, β-arrestin (short and long forms), and arrestin 3 (short and long forms) to various functional forms of rhodopsin (Rh), the β2AR, and the m2 mAChR. These functional forms include the phosphorylated receptors (P-Rh, P-β2AR, P-mAChR), phosphorylated and activated 2We use the term activated to refer to the agonist-occupied receptor while non-activated refers to the antagonist-occupied receptor. However, this does not necessarily imply that all of the receptors are in a completely activated or non-activated conformation. We use the term specificity to refer to the ability of a given arrestin to bind to different receptors, while the term selectivity refers to the ability of an arrestin to discriminate among the different functional forms of a given receptor. receptors (P-Rh ∗ , P-β2AR ∗ , P-mAChR ∗ ), non-activated receptors (Rh, β2AR, mAChR), and activated receptors (Rh ∗ , β2AR ∗ , mAChR ∗ ). As previously demonstrated, visual arrestin preferentially binds to P-Rh ∗ with a P-Rh ∗ /P-Rh binding ratio of ~ 12 (Fig. 1A). Arr3S, arr3L, βarr, and βarrS demonstrate a 2-3-fold lower level of binding to P-Rh ∗ compared to arr. In addition, β-arrestin and arrestin 3 also bind to rhodopsin less selectively compared to arrestin with P-Rh ∗ /P-Rh binding ratios from 1.3 for arr3L to 2.1 for βarr. The selectivity profiles of βarr and arr3 binding to the m2 mAChR qualitatively resemble those seen with rhodopsin (Fig. 1B). All of the arrestins bind preferentially to P-mAChR ∗ with arr3S binding being ~ 1.5-fold higher than arr3L, βarr, and βarrL, and ~ 19-fold higher than arr. The P-mAChR∗/P-mAChR binding ratio is 1.6-1.9 for all arrestins, similar to that observed for βarr and arr3 binding to rhodopsin. Since no direct binding studies of arrestin interaction with the β2AR have been reported, we initially attempted to optimize the conditions to study βarr and arr3 binding to the β2AR. Binding to the β2AR was found to reach an apparent equilibrium following a 30-min incubation at 30°C, which was maintained for at least another 30 min. The minimum phosphorylation level necessary for βarr and arr3S to recognize the phosphorylated form of the β2AR was 2-3 mol of Pi/mol of β2AR, while additional phosphorylation up to 10-11 mol/mol did not increase βarr or arr3S binding (not shown). The selectivity profiles of βarr, arr3, and arr binding to the β2AR are very similar to those observed with the m2 mAChR (Fig. 1C). Arr3S demonstrates the highest binding, followed by arr3L, βarr, and βarrS. Arr binding to the β2AR was 4-9-fold lower than the other arrestins. The discrimination of βarr and arr3 between the P-β2AR ∗ and P-β2AR is also very similar to that observed for the m2 mAChR (1.5-1.8-fold). Previously, we demonstrated that a conventional Scatchard analysis could be used to study βarr and arr binding to the P-mAChR ∗ (24Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More extensive analysis demonstrates that arr3S and arr3L (Kd = 0.35-0.38 nM), and βarr and βarrS (Kd = 0.5-0.6 nM) have similar affinities for the human P-m2 mAChR ∗ , while arr (Kd = 7.2 nM) has a substantially lower affinity (Table 1). The number of binding sites, determined in the presence of 50 fmol of P-mAChR ∗ , was also substantially different among the arrestins with a Bmax of 15-19 fmol for arr3S, arr3L, βarrS, and βarr and only ~ 7 fmol for arr. A similar analysis of arrestin binding to the human P-β2AR ∗ demonstrates that βarr and βarrS have the highest affinity (Kd = 0.14-0.19 nM), followed by arr3S and arr3L (Kd = 0.33-0.36 nM), and arr (Kd = 2.1 nM) (Table 1). Thus, the affinity of βarr and βarrS for the P-β2AR ∗ is 3-4 times higher than for the P-mAChR ∗ , while the affinity of arr3L and arr3S for both receptors is comparable. The number of binding sites, determined in the presence of 50 fmol of P-β2AR ∗ , was highest for arr3S (17 fmol), followed by arr3L (11 fmol), βarrS (7.1 fmol), arr (5.5 fmol), and βarr (4.1 fmol).Tabled 1 A prominent difference between the binding of visual arrestin and the non-visual arrestins is the substantially greater selectivity of visual arrestin for the phosphorylated and activated form of the receptor. While β-arrestin and arrestin 3 preferentially bind to the phosphorylated form of a given receptor, they appear to be less dependent on the activation state of the receptor. To further analyze this phenomenon we studied the binding of βarr and arr3S to the P-mAChR and P-β2AR in the presence of either agonist or antagonist. These studies revealed that the agonist promotes a 2-3-fold increase in Bmax for βarr and arr3S compared to the antagonist with no appreciable difference in the Kd (Table 1). These results suggest that the agonist predominantly alters the number of phosphorylated receptors capable of interacting with a given arrestin, presumably by converting more receptors to an “active” conformation. However, it is clear that not all of the receptors are active even in the presence of agonist since the Bmax is always lower than the number of receptor molecules in the assay. The differences in Bmax may reflect the ability of a given arrestin to promote the formation of and/or stabilize an agonist-phosphoreceptor-arrestin complex, analogous to the agonist-receptor-G protein ternary complex(29Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Michel T. Stadel J.M. Fed. Proc. 1982; 41: 2664-2670PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively low Bmax observed for arrestin binding (Table 1) prompted us to search for experimental conditions that favored the formation of a high affinity agonist-receptor-arrestin complex. To this end we studied the effects of G protein β γ subunits on βarr and arr3S binding. For these studies the β2AR and m2 mAChR were initially phosphorylated to a stoichiometry of 3-4 mol/mol in the absence of β γ subunits. When purified bovine brain β γ subunits (at a 1:1 ratio with receptor) were included in the binding assay they significantly increased the Bmax of both βarr and arr3S binding to the P-mAChR ∗ (31 and 38%, respectively), without effecting the Kd. Similar experiments with the P-β2AR ∗ revealed that β γ subunits had no effect on either the Kd or Bmax of βarr or arr3S binding. Thus, it appears that β γ subunits do not directly interact with arrestins since the effects observed are similar for both βarr and"
https://openalex.org/W2078205387,"Ferritin, by regulating the intracellular iron pool, controls iron-catalyzed generation of reactive oxygen species, but its role in oxidative damage is still unclear. We show that ferritin synthesis is significantly stimulated in the liver of rats subjected to oxidative stress by treatment with phorone, a glutathione-depleting drug. RNA-bandshift assays document reduced activity of iron regulatory factor, in particular of IRFB, the cytoplasmic protein that post-transcriptionally controls ferritin mRNA translation. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis shows increased accumulation of H and L subunit mRNAs, and nuclear run-on experiments provide evidence of transcriptional activation. Direct measurements of intracellular free iron levels by EPR indicate that the increased ferritin synthesis can be mediated by an expansion of the free iron pool. An early drop of ferritin content after phorone treatment indicates that part of the iron that fuels the free pool might derive from ferritin degradation. Present data seem to suggest that, under conditions of oxidative stress, liver ferritin can represent either a pro- or an anti-oxidant in a time-dependent manner. In fact, its early degradation contributes to expand the intracellular free iron pool that, later on, activates multiple molecular mechanisms to reconstitute ferritin content, thus limiting the pro-oxidant challenge of iron."

The pro-gelatinase A activation function of MT-MMP was abolished by truncation of the TM domain and recovered by fusing the MT-MMP mutant with the TM domain of interleukin 2 receptor α-chain. The truncated MT-MMP was released from the cells into the medium and detected as processed or modified forms. In spite of the deletion of the TM domain some portions of the mutant MT-MMP were still retained on the surface of cells. Thus, MT-MMP has an additional device to keep it on the cell surface.

Thus, the putative pro-gelatinase A activator may be a member of the MMP family.We isolated a cDNA clone that encodes a hitherto unknown MMP named MT-MMP(21Takino T. Sato H. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; (in press)Google Scholar, 22Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). MT-MMP is expressed as a 63-kDa protein on the surface of transfected cells with MT-MMP cDNA. At the same time, the cells caused specific activation of 72-kDa pro-gelatinase A(22Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Since MT-MMP has a potential TM domain and was not released into the culture medium, the TM domain is thought to play a direct role in MT-MMP integration into the plasma membrane. In this study, we examined whether the potential TM domain is indeed required for anchoring MT-MMP onto the cell surface by constructing deletions and chimeric molecules. The pro-gelatinase A activation function was also examined in relation to the subcellular localization of MT-MMP mutants.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of PlasmidsThe SV40 early promoter of the pSG5 plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to express MT-MMP as reported(22Sato H.

The cDNA fragments encoding the C terminus of MT-MMP (Gly535 to Val582) harboring the deduced TM domain (Ala539 to Phe562) or the TM domain of IL-2R (Val239 to Ile270) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Fragments were then ligated to the 3′-end of the TIMP-1 cDNA fragment to express both proteins as fusion products and subcloned into the pSG5 expression vector. A deletion mutant lacking the deduced TM domain of MT-MMP (ΔMT-MMP) was constructed by inserting a BamHI linker and a termination codon at Gly535. Five extra amino acids (Gly-Phe-Arg-Ser-Tyr) derived from the BamHI linker were added to the truncated C terminus. A chimera between ΔMT-MMP and the heterologous TM domain of IL-2R (ΔMT-MMP/TMIL·2R ) was constructed using the introduced BamHI site in the ΔMT-MMP plasmid and the amplified TM DNA fragment described above. The predicted products were 57 kDa for ΔMT-MMP, 60 kDa for ΔMT-MMP/TMIL·2R , 24.8 kDa for TIMP/TMIL·2R , and 26.6 kDa for TIMP/TMMT·MMP (Fig. 1).Cell Culture and TransfectionCOS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 mM glutamine under a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

After transfection for 36 h, the cells were labeled with 30 μCi/ml [35 35S] methionine (SJQ0079, Amersham Corp.) in methionine-free DMEM (10% FCS) and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Thereafter, the medium was collected and clarified by centrifugation. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol). Both the conditioned media and cell lysates were incubated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against TIMP-1 (50-1H7) or MT-MMP (113-5B7, 114-2F2) (mAbs were provided by Fuji Chemical Industries, Ltd., Takaoka, Japan). Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with protein A coupled to Sepharose beads by centrifugation. After washing with lysis buffer, immunoprecipitates were suspended and boiled in sample buffer (50 mM Tris.HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and then electrophoresis proceeded in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel with a discontinuous buffer system. The radioactivity was detected by a Bioimage Analyzer BAS1000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).Preparation of Cell Membrane FractionThe cell membrane was extracted as described(17Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with mutant and wild type MT-MMP expression plasmids were cultured for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. Cells were collected and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The whole-cell homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction was collected. The cell organelle-enriched fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The pellet was resuspended in saline and layered onto a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (20, 30, 50, and 60% sucrose) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 3 h. The plasma membrane-enriched fraction at the 30-50% sucrose interface was collected and pelleted again. The pellets were dissolved in HEPES/KOH buffer (25 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM CaCl2) at a final protein concentration of 3 mg/ml.Western BlottingMembrane fractions of the COS-1 cells transfected with various plasmids were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS gel-loading buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mM dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol). The samples were resolved by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Corp.) using a semidry system (Biometra, Gottingen, Germany). The membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with mAbs against TIMP-1 and MT-MMP (113-5B7) for 16 h at room temperature. The final concentration of each mAb was 1 μg/ml in 3% BSA/PBS. After extensive washing with TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl), the membrane was reprobed with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Cappel, West Chester, PA) 1:4000 in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was developed in a 20-ml buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, containing 5 μl of 30% H2O2, 5 mg of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. The reaction was terminated by rinsing the blot in water.Antibody Binding Surface Protein AssayThe procedure was performed as described(27Gabuzda D.H. Lever A. Terwilliger E. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3306-3315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were co-transfected with β-galactosidase and ΔMT-MMP or MT-MMP expression plasmids and then metabolically labeled with [35 35S]methionine for 6 h at 36 h after transfection. The labeled cells were washed three times with 3% BSA/PBS and then incubated with anti-MT-MMP (114-2F2, 5 μg/ml) and anti-β-galactosidase (5 μg/ml; Promega, Madison, WI) at 37°C for 40 min, rinsed three times with 3% BSA/PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer on ice. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose as described above.Activation of Pro-gelatinase APlasma membrane fractions (10 μg) were mixed with 0.5 μl of FCS as a source of pro-gelatinase A and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by gelatin zymography.Gelatin ZymographyZymography was performed as described(28Hibbs M.S. Hasty K.A. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Marinardi C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2493-2500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer in the absence of a reducing agent and incubated for 20 min to denature MMPs and dissociate MMP-TIMP complexes. Electrophoresis proceeded on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS and gelatin at a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v). Thereafter, gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h to remove the SDS. During this process, pro-enzymes are activated autocatalytically. Gels were then incubated for 24 h at 37°C in a reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3) and stained with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. The location of gelatinolytic activity is detectable as a clear band in the background of uniform staining.RESULTSThe TM Domain of MT-MMP Functions as a Membrane LinkerTo assess the role of the putative TM domain of MT-MMP as a membrane linker, we prepared a fusion protein between the TM domain and a secretory protein, TIMP-1, by manipulating the cDNAs of both proteins (Fig. 1). Thus a plasmid was constructed that expressed chimeric TIMP/TMMT·MMP . The TM domain of the IL-2 receptor α-chain (IL-2R) was used as a positive control, and a fusion protein TIMP/TMIL·2R was constructed. TIMP-1 and fusion proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells by transient transfection of the plasmids. After labeling with [35 35S]methionine, cell lysates were prepared and examined by immunoprecipitation using anti-TIMP-1 mAb. TIMP-1 can be detected as a 28-kDa band after glycosylation of the translated 21-kDa product(29Waterhouse P. Khokha R. Denhardt D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5585-5589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TIMP/TMIL·2R and TIMP/TMMT·MMP were detected in cell lysates as 32- and 34-kDa bands, respectively, that were proportional to the calculated molecular weights (Fig. 1 and 2A).Among these proteins, only TIMP-1 was detected in the culture medium, whereas the other chimeric proteins were not. Thus, both of the TM domains fused to TIMP-1 seem to inhibit the release of the products into the medium. However, it is possible that overexpressed chimeric proteins disturb the normal secretory machinery in the cells. To examine this possibility, the effect of chimeric protein expression upon TIMP-1 secretion was analyzed by co-transfecting the chimeric plasmids together with that expressing TIMP-1. TIMP-1 was secreted normally, whereas both chimeras were detected only in the cell lysate (Fig. 2B).Figure 2:Expression of TIMP-1 and its chimeras in COS-1 cells. Plasmids encoding TIMP-1 and its chimeras (TIMP/TMMT·MMP and TIMP/TMIL·2R ) were transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. Cells were then labeled with [35 35S]methionine for 4 h, and proteins in the cell lysate and in the medium were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against TIMP-1 (50-1H7). Precipitates were separated on SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels and the radioactivity was detected by means of autoradiography. Molecular size markers are indicated in the figures. A, the transfected plasmids were pSG5 vector alone (Control), the expression plasmids for TIMP-1 (TIMP), TIMP/TMMT·MMP , and TIMP/TMIL·2R . Molecular mass of the products were 28, 32, and 34 kDa, respectively, as indicated in the figure. Other bands were nonspecific. B, TIMP-1 was co-expressed with TIMP/TMMT·MMP (TIMP/TMMT-MMP + TIMP) or TIMP/TMIL·2R (TIMP/TMIL-2R + TIMP), and others were the same as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To ensure the localization of the chimeras on the cell surface, transfected cells were grown on coverslips and examined by indirect immunofluorescence staining by incubating the cells with anti-TIMP-1 mAb without permeabilization(22Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Whereas TIMP-1-producing cells were not stained with anti-TIMP-1 antibody, TIMP/TMMT·MMP - and TIMP/TMIL·2R -producing cells were positively stained on the cell surface (data not shown). These results indicated that the TM domain of IL-2R can trap a naturally secretory TIMP-1 on the cell surface and that the activity of the TM domain of MT-MMP is also comparable with that of IL-2R. Thus, the TM domain of MT-MMP is a membrane linker.The Role of the TM Domain on Pro-gelatinase A Activation FunctionTo examine the role of the TM domain of MT-MMP in pro-gelatinase A activation function, the C terminus including the TM domain was truncated (ΔMT-MMP) as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 1). COS-1 cells that produce pro-gelatinase A into the culture supernatant were used as the recipient for transfection assay. Pro-gelatinase A activation was monitored by gelatin zymography. Transfection with the MT-MMP plasmid induced processing of pro-gelatinase A (66-kDa) into the activated form (62-kDa) via an intermediate form (64-kDa) (Fig. 3B)(17Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar), whereas the truncated mutant ΔMT-MMP failed to activate it. The defect was not because of the low levels of ΔMT-MMP expression as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A), and pro-gelatinase A activation was not induced even when the doses of the transfected ΔMT-MMP plasmid were increased (data not shown). Thus, the TM domain of MT-MMP is indispensable for pro-gelatinase A activation.Figure 3:Deletion of the TM domain from MT-MMP and its effect on pro-gelatinase A activation. COS-1 cells were transfected with the expression plasmids pSG5 (Control), ΔMT-MMP, and MT-MMP. A, transfected cells were labeled with [35 35S]methionine for 4 h, and cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-MT-MMP monoclonal antibody (113-5B7). B, COS-1 cells transfected with MT-MMP, ΔMT-MMP, or vector plasmid were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 12 h. Conditioned medium (15 μl) was mixed with SDS electrophoresis sample buffer (without dithiothreitol) and separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. After gelatin digestion as described under “Materials and Methods,” the gel was stained with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Sequence Specificity of the TM Domain of MT-MMPIt is still possible to argue that the TM domain of MT-MMP is required for pro-gelatinase A activation in a sequence-specific manner rather than as a membrane linker. To test this notion, the TM domain of IL-2 receptor α-chain was fused to ΔMT-MMP (ΔMT-MMP/TMIL·2R ), and the recovery of pro-gelatinase A activation function was investigated. Transient expression of ΔMT-MMP/TMIL·2R in COS-1 cells induced pro-gelatinase A activation as efficiently as MT-MMP. Then, plasma membrane fractions of the transfected cells were prepared, and their activities against the exogenous pro-gelatinase A that is in fetal calf serum (FCS) were examined (Fig. 4). Plasma membrane fractions from the transfected cells did not contain any gelatinolytic activity by themselves. After incubation with FCS, only preparations from the cells that express MT-MMP and ΔMT-MMP/TMIL·2R retained the activity to generate active forms of gelatinase A, whereas that from the ΔMT-MMP-transfected cells did not (Fig. 4). Thus, we concluded that the heterologous TM domain was sufficient to recover the biochemical function of MT-MMP and that particular sequences in the TM domain were not essential for this function.Figure 4:Pro-gelatinase A activation by the plasma membrane fraction. COS-1 cells transfected with plasmids were homogenized, and plasma membrane fractions were prepared by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Membrane fractions (10 μg of protein) were incubated with (+) or without(-) fetal calf serum (Serum) for 120 min at 37°C, and gelatinolytic activities were analyzed by gelatin zymography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Secretion of the Mutant MT-MMPPlasmids encoding MT-MMP and ΔMT-MMP were transfected into COS-1 cells together with the TIMP-1 plasmid, and the products in the culture media were examined by immunoprecipitation with mAbs. Both MT-MMP and ΔMT-MMP were detected at similar levels in the cell lysates (Fig. 5). MT-MMP was not released into the culture medium as reported, and the co-expressed secretory protein (TIMP-1) was released and accumulated in the medium (Fig. 5)(22Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). However, ΔMT-MMP was detected in the culture medium, though at lower levels as compared with the co-expressed TIMP-1 (Fig. 5). Two fragments (64- and 54-kDa) detected in the medium were specifically reacted with anti-MT-MMP mAbs recognizing different epitopes (113-5B7 and 114-2F2), and they were not the same size as those in the cell lysate. It is not clear at this moment what kind of processing or modification is associated with the molecules released into the culture medium. However, it is clear that deletion of the TM domain from MT-MMP facilitated the release of the fragments into the medium.Figure 5:Expression of ΔMT-MMP and its release into culture medium. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with pSG5 (Control), MT-MMP, or ΔMT-MMP plasmid together with TIMP-1 plasmid. Cells were labeled with [35 35S]methionine, and proteins in the media or cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-MT-MMP mAb (113-5B7) and anti-TIMP-1 mAb (50-1H7). Specific bands detected by mAbs are indicated. Two bands in the media from ΔMT-MMP+TIMP (indicated by arrows) were detected by another anti-MT-MMP mAb (114-2F2) (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the loss of cell surface expression of ΔMT-MMP further, antibody binding studies against the cell surface molecules (27Gabuzda D.H. Lever A. Terwilliger E. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3306-3315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed. Metabolically labeled, transfected cells were first incubated with mAbs without permeabilization, and excess antibodies were removed. The cells were then lysed, and immune complexes that formed on the surface were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. The negative control was β-galactosidase, a cytoplasmic protein, and it was detected only in the cell lysate (Fig. 6A). On the contrary, both MT-MMP and ΔMT-MMP were precipitated by this procedure as shown in Fig. 6A. The secretory protein TIMP-1 was not precipitated under these conditions (data not shown). Thus, a substantial fraction of ΔMT-MMP remains on the cell surface, although it is thought to be gradually shed into the medium. These results suggested that MT-MMP has an additional device to keep it on the surface of cells other than its TM domain. Western blotting of the plasma membrane preparations, which were used for the study as described in the previous section (Fig. 4), demonstrated that both ΔMT-MMP and MT-MMP co-purified with the membrane fractions (Fig. 6B). This is also another indication that ΔMT-MMP is still associating with the cell surface.Figure 6:Localization of ΔMT-MMP and MT-MMP on the plasma membrane. A, the β-galactosidase (β-Gal) expression plasmid was co-transfected into COS-1 cells with pSG5, ΔMT-MMP, and MT-MMP plasmids. Living cells were then incubated with mAbs against MT-MMP and β-Gal, and then excess antibodies were washed and the cells were lysed. Immune complexes were precipitated together with protein A-Sepharose (Surface). By contrast, lysates were prepared from the cells that were not incubated with mAbs and immunoprecipitated as described in Fig. 5(Lysate). B, plasma membrane fractions of COS-1 cells transfected with pSG5, ΔMT-MMP, and MT-MMP plasmids were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-MT-MMP mAb (113-5B7) and anti-TIMP-1 mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONMT-MMP is an MMP recently discovered by cDNA cloning(21Takino T.

https://openalex.org/W1980839772,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a paracrine inducer of morphogenesis and invasive growth in epithelial and endothelial cells. HGF is secreted by mesenchymal cells as an inactive precursor (pro-HGF). The crucial step for HGF activation is the extracellular hydrolysis of the Arg 494 -Val 495 bond, which converts pro-HGF into αβ-HGF, the high-affinity ligand for the Met receptor. We previously reported that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) activates pro-HGF in vitro. We now show that this is a stoichiometric reaction, and provide evidence for its occurrence in tissue culture.Activation involves the formation of a stable complex between pro-HGF and uPA. This complex was isolated from the in vitro reaction of pure uPA with recombinant pro-HGF, as well as from the membrane of target cells, after sequential addition of uPA and pro-HGF. On the cell membrane, the uPA•HGF complex was bound to the Met receptor.Monocytic cell lines, and primary monocytes after adhesion, activated efficiently pro-HGF both on their surface and in the culture medium. This activation was inhibited by anti-catalytic anti-uPA antibodies, and occurred by a stoichiometric reaction.The stoichiometry of the activation reaction suggests that the biological effects of HGF can be titrated in vivo by the level of uPA activity. Adequate amounts of uPA can be locally provided by the macrophages, which would condition the tissue microenvironment by rendering HGF bioavailable to its target cells.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), ( 1The abbreviations used are: HGFhepatocyte growth factoruPAurokinase plasminogen activatorPN-1protease nexin-1PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidDSTdisuccinimidyl tartratePBSphosphate-buffered saline.) also known as Scatter Factor, is a unique growth factor capable of inducing an invasive growth pattern in its target epithelial and endothelial cells. Among its recognized effects are: (i) dissociation of epithelial sheets, or cell scattering (Stoker et al., 1987; Gherardi et al., 1989; Weidner et al., 1990, 1991; Naldini et al., 1991b); (ii) increased motility and chemotaxis of dissociated cells (Morimoto et al., 1991; Bussolino et al., 1992; Giordano et al., 1993); (iii) mitogenesis (Michalopoulos et al., 1984; Nakamura et al., 1984; Russel et al., 1984; Rubin et al., 1991; Kan et al., 1991; Matsumoto et al., 1991; Igawa et al., 1991; Bussolino et al., 1992; Halaban et al., 1992); (iv) invasion of extracellular matrices (Weidner et al., 1990; Naldini et al., 1991b); (v) organization of invading cells into complex structures such as branching tubules (Montesano et al., 1991). Coordinate execution of these events is required for physiological processes such as morphogenesis of epithelial organs, angiogenesis, and tissue repair, and is a feature of invasive neoplasms. In vivo, HGF is a powerful angiogenetic factor (Bussolino et al., 1992; Grant et al., 1993) and it has been involved in kidney and liver regeneration (Nagaike et al., 1991; Higuchi and Nakamura, 1991). HGF is the ligand for the tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the MET proto-oncogene (Naldini et al., 1991a, 1991b; Bottaro et al., 1991). hepatocyte growth factor urokinase plasminogen activator protease nexin-1 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid disuccinimidyl tartrate phosphate-buffered saline. In vivo, HGF is thought to act in a paracrine fashion: it is produced by mesenchymal/stromal cells (Stoker et al., 1987), and its receptor is found on epithelial cells nearby (Sonnemberg et al., 1993). HGF is secreted as a single-chain, 92-kDa precursor devoid of biological activity (pro-HGF; Naldini et al.(1992), Naka et al.(1992) and Mizuno et al.(1992)). Pro-HGF binds the cell surface or the extracellular matrix, presumably via its affinity for heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (Naldini et al., 1991b). Pro-HGF also binds the Met receptor, but with low affinity and without triggering its kinase activity (Naldini et al., 1992; Hartmann et al., 1992; Lokker et al., 1992). Limited proteolysis of pro-HGF at the Arg 494 -Val 495 bond yields a disulfide-linked heterodimer of a 60-kDa (α) and a 32-36-kDa (β) chain (αβ-HGF; Nakamura et al.(1987), Gohda et al.(1988), Zarnegar and Michalopoulos(1989), Gherardi et al.(1989), and Weidner et al.(1990)). The α chain consists of a putative hairpin loop and four triple-disulfide structures called kringles (Patthy et al., 1984). The β chain has homology to the catalytic domain of serine proteases but lacks enzymatic activity (Nakamura et al., 1989; Miyazawa et al., 1989). αβ-HGF binds the Met receptor with high affinity, triggers its kinase activity and a biological response in target cells (Naldini et al., 1991a, 1991b; Bottaro et al., 1991). Maturation of pro-HGF into the bioactive dimer takes place in the extracellular environment. Thus, a crucial limiting step occurs in the HGF signaling pathway after its secretion. We previously showed that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) activates pro-HGF in vitro (Naldini et al., 1992). This finding was consistent with the high degree of structural homology between HGF and plasminogen, and with the near identity of the proteolytic cleavage site (Miyazawa et al., 1989; Nakamura et al., 1989; Sottrup-Jensen et al., 1978). Other investigators have shown that an enzyme purified from serum can also process pro-HGF in vitro (Shimomura et al., 1992). This enzyme is homologous to the blood coagulation Factor XII (Miyazawa et al., 1993), is present in plasma as an inactive zymogen, and is activated by limited proteolysis by thrombin (Shimomura et al., 1993). Whether either or both uPA and the Factor XII homolog have a role in vivo in pro-HGF activation remained unsettled. UPA has been critically involved in tissue remodeling, cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (reviewed in Saksela and Rifkin(1988)). Possible mechanisms for these biological activities are triggering of a protease cascade digesting the extracellular matrix, and activation of latent growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-β (Sato et al., 1990) and pro-HGF. uPA is an extracellular serine endoprotease with a multimodular structure (reviewed in Furie and Furie (1988). It is secreted as an inactive, single-chain protein of 55 kDa (Kasai et al., 1985; Petersen et al., 1988), and subsequently cleaved into an enzymatically active, two-chain molecule (Kasai et al., 1985). The 20-kDa A chain bears an epidermal growth factor-like domain which mediates binding to the uPA receptor on the surface of several cell types (Appella et al., 1987), followed by a kringle domain. The 34-kDa B chain is the catalytic moiety. The fraction of uPA bound to its receptor on the cell surface is thought to be the most biologically relevant. uPA activates plasminogen, present in high concentrations in serum and extracellular fluids, to plasmin, a fibrynolytic enzyme with broad substrate specificity. uPA is negatively regulated by two specific inhibitors, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 and type-2, and by protease nexin-1 (PN-1; reviewed in Blasi et al.(1987) and Saksela and Rifkin(1988)). In this work, we report the unexpected finding that uPA activates pro-HGF by a stoichiometric reaction. This is due to the formation of a stable complex between HGF and uPA, both in vitro, with the pure reagents, and on the membrane of target cells, after the binding of pro-HGF and uPA to their receptors. Moreover, we provide evidence for a direct role of endogenous uPA in the activation of pro-HGF by monocytes in cell culture. All reagents used were of analytical grade. Bovine serum albumin, crystalline, cell-culture tested, was purchased from Sigma.

Cell lines were obtained from ATCC, and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Full-length HGF cDNA was cloned from human liver mRNA and inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector PVL1393 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The recombinant vector was cotransfected with the BsuI-digested BacPak6 viral DNA (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) into Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (Sf9) by the lipofectin procedure (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Positive clones were identified and purified by dot-blot hybridization and plaque assay. The recombinant virus was used to infect Sf9 cells with dilutions of 10 -1 , 10 -2 , 10 -3 , and 10 -6 . After 1 week, the infected cell extracts were blotted on a nylon filter and probed with radiolabeled full-length human HGF cDNA. The viruses containing the HGF cDNA gene were subsequently purified by plaque assay. Single viral clones were isolated and used for large scale infection of Sf9 cells. Recombinant pro-HGF was purified by affinity chromatography on heparin (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), according to the procedure published by Weidner et al.(1990), with some modifications. Sf9 S. frugiperda cells were grown at 27°C in serum-free SF900 medium (Life Technologies, Inc. Ltd., Scotland). Exponentially growing cultures were infected by adding the viral stock in serum-free culture medium, and the cells were grown for 3 days. The culture medium was collected, spun at 300 × g for 15 min, to remove cellular debris, and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was buffered to pH 7.4 with Tris, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin) and the detergent CHAPS to a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v), filtered on a 0.45-μm pore Tuffryn membrane filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) by vacuum suction, cooled to 4°C, and applied to a 5-ml heparin-agarose column assembled in an fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus in the cold room with a loading rate of 8 ml/h. The column was sequentially washed with 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% CHAPS, and 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% CHAPS until the eluant absorbance returned to the baseline. Bound materials were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.5 M to 1.8 M NaCl over 8 h in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% CHAPS, with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, and 2-ml fractions were collected. The starting material, the column breakthrough and washings, and the eluted fractions, were scored for the content of pro-HGF by the Madin-Darby canine kidney cell scattering assay in the presence of serum (Weidner et al., 1990; Naldini et al., 1992). The fractions containing the peak of HGF activity, eluting at approximately 1 M NaCl, were pooled, concentrated with a diafiltration device with 30,000 molecular weight cut off (Amicon Div., Grace Industrial, Switzerland), checked for biological activity on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, and purity by SDS-PAGE and protein stains, and stored in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. The average yield of the procedure was 150 μg of pro-HGF from 700 ml of culture supernatant. The purity of pro-HGF was higher than 95%. When tested for scattering activity on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in the presence of serum, pro-HGF was activated to a specific activity of 10 scatter units/ng of protein. Pro-HGF (1 μg) was radiolabeled with carrier-free Na 125 I (1 mCi) and IODO-GEN (50 μg/ml, Pierce Chemical Co.) as described previously (Naldini et al., 1991b) to a specific activity of approximately 1.8 × 108 cpm/μg. Trace amounts of 125 I-pro-HGF were added to known amounts of unlabeled pro-HGF to the desired specific activity, and incubated with two-chain uPA in 100 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 38 mM NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, at 37°C, in siliconized tubes. Proteolytic cleavage of 125 I-pro-HGF was monitored by reducing SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and scanning of the autoradiogram. When required, the absorbance values of the HGF bands were converted into moles by comparison with the absorbance of known amounts of untreated 125 I-pro-HGF. 125 I-pro-HGF (1 nM) and two-chain uPA (2 units) were incubated in 100 μl of 50 mM borate, pH 8.8, 38 mM NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 at 37°C, for the indicated time in siliconized tubes. When required, disuccinimidyl tartrate (DST) was then added at 0.1 mM or 1 mM and incubated for 15 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (stop buffer). The samples were diluted to 1 ml with the same buffer, immunoprecipitated using Sepharose-Protein A precharged either with rabbit anti-uPA antiserum (5 μl), or normal rabbit serum, washed three times with stop buffer, three times with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 M LiCl, three times with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, and then solubilized with Laemmli buffer. Protein complexes were separated using reducing SDS-PAGE methods and visualized by autoradiography. Monolayers of human A549 or GTL16 cells were washed twice with RPMI supplemented with 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (RHB), incubated with 100 units/ml two-chain uPA in RHB for 1 h at 37°C, washed three times with RHB, and further incubated with 0.6 nM 125 I-pro-HGF in RHB, either for 30 min at 37°C, or for 2 h at 4°C. After five washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the monolayers were exposed to 1 mM disuccinimidyl suberate or DST in PBS for 15 min at 4°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mM Tris-HCl, and the monolayers were washed once with PBS, then extracted with HEPS buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1.25% CHAPS (w/v)) supplemented with 10 mM iodoacetamide and 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 20 min at 4°C. In these conditions more than 50% of the HGF receptor is solubilized. After clearing by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, the extracts were immunoprecipitated with Sepharose-Protein A beads precharged either with immune or preimmune sera, for 2 h at 4°C. After five washes with HEPS buffer, the beads were eluted with nonreducing Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For control experiments, cell monolayers were washed twice with acid buffer (50 mM glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, 0.1 M NaCl) for 3 min at room temperature (Stoppelli et al., 1986), rinsed twice with RHB, and incubated with or without 100 units/ml uPA, prior to incubation with 0.6 nM 125 I-pro-HGF for 30 min at 37°C. After washing and cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate as above, antisera or control rabbit serum were added to the monolayers in RHB (10 μl/ml), on ice. After 2 h incubation on ice, the monolayers were washed three times with RHB, extracted, and immunoprecipitated with Sepharose-Protein A beads as described above. Cell monolayers, grown in 6-well Costar plates, were extensively washed with RHB, and incubated with 0.3 nM 125 I-pro-HGF in RHB at 37°C. Suspensions of U-937 and THP-1 cells were incubated for 48 h with or without 50 nM tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, washed, and cultured for further 18 h in serum-free medium, prior to washing and incubation with 125 I-pro-HGF in RHB. After different incubation times, culture supernatants were collected and Laemmli buffer was added. At the same time, the cell monolayers were also solubilized with Laemmli buffer. Proteolytic cleavage of 125 I-HGF was monitored by reducing SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Buffy coats from blood donors were obtained from Banca del Sangue e del Plasma (Cittá di Torino), diluted with equal volume of PBS, and separated by Ficoll (Nycomed Pharma, Norway) density gradient centrifugation. Mononuclear cells were washed three times in PBS and then plated on Petri dishes at a concentration of about 6 × 105 cells/cm2 in endotoxin-free Medium 199 (M199, Sigma) supplemented with 10% endotoxin-free bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) or 10% plasma from blood donors containing 50 IU/ml heparin. After incubation for 1.5 h at 37°C, nonadherent cells were removed by washing five times with PBS. The monolayers of monocytes were then used for studying activation of 125 I-pro-HGF. All preparations of monocytes were scored for cell viability by trypan blue exclusion, and used only if more than 98% of the cells looked viable. Monolayers of monocytes or differentiated U937 or THP-1 cells, obtained as described above, were extensively washed and incubated in serum-free RHB medium for 2 h. Cell-conditioned media were collected, centrifuged at 100 × g for 10 min, and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. For pro-HGF activation assay, control and cell-conditioned media were incubated with 0.3 nM 125 I-pro-HGF for increasing times. For inhibition studies, the indicated inhibitors were preincubated for 30 min at 37°C prior to addition of 125 I-pro-HGF. The kinetics of proteolytic cleavage of pro-HGF by uPA was studied in vitro using highly purified reagents. Recombinant human pro-HGF was obtained from the Baculovirus expression system under serum-free culture conditions, and purified to near homogeneity by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. This preparation of HGF was virtually in the precursor form, and free from any possible contamination from serum components. In order to monitor proteolytic cleavage at concentrations of reactants in the physiological range, pro-HGF was radiolabeled with [ 125 I]iodine, as described previously (Naldini et al., 1991b). Two-chain human urinary uPA was purified to homogeneity and had a specific activity of 50 units/μg. We detected efficient processing of pro-HGF by nanomolar concentrations of uPA at 37°C. Time course analysis showed saturation kinetics with a decreasing production of two-chain HGF over the hours (not shown). As expected, the initial rate of the reaction was dependent on the amount of uPA added. Surprisingly, however, the total amount of two-chain HGF produced by an overnight incubation was also dependent on the concentration of enzyme. For prolonged times, the limiting factor in product yield was found to be the concentration of enzyme added, and not, as expected from a catalytic mechanism, the initial concentration of substrate. A linear relationship was found between the total amount of HGF processed overnight and the amount of uPA, as long as the concentration of substrate was higher than that of the enzyme (Fig. 1). In these conditions, the product of the reaction accumulated to approximately one-half the molar amount of the enzyme. The uPA concentrations given refers to the catalytically active enzyme, titrated with a chromogenic substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Control experiments showed that the specific activity of uPA was not affected by prolonged incubation in the reaction buffer (not shown). These observations pointed to a stoichiometric reaction between uPA and pro-HGF. In order to estimate the affinity of pro-HGF as substrate for uPA, we studied the initial rate of proteolytic cleavage as a function of the substrate concentration. We used two different approaches. In the first type of experiment, we added increasing concentrations of 125 I-pro-HGF to the reaction mixture, and measured the net amount of labeled two-chain HGF produced. A fast saturation of the reaction rate was observed with increasing concentrations of substrate. Half-maximal rate was reached with 3.5 nM pro-HGF (Fig. 2A). In the second type of experiments, increasing concentrations of unlabeled pro-HGF were added to a fixed concentration of 125 I-labeled substrate. We then measured the inhibition of proteolytic cleavage of 125 I-pro-HGF as an indirect estimate of the saturation of the reaction. According to theoretical predictions, the extent of proteolytic cleavage of a labeled substrate is unaffected by the addition of unlabeled substrate as long as their total concentration remains well below saturation of the enzyme, the reaction rate being directly proportional to the concentration of substrate. Approaching saturation results in the progressive inhibition of proteolytic cleavage of the labeled substrate. These experiments provided a similar estimate of approximately 7 nM for the concentration of pro-HGF giving half-maximal rate of proteolytic cleavage by uPA (Fig. 2B). As the maximal rate of the reaction was reached with very low concentrations of substrate, a high affinity interaction must take place between pro-HGF and uPA. In order to explain the stoichiometric reaction between uPA and HGF, we monitored the formation of a stable complex between the reaction products in vitro, by coprecipitation and covalent cross-linking experiments. 125 I-pro-HGF was incubated with or without uPA for increasing times, and the samples were immunoprecipitated with an antiserum against uPA. The precipitation of radiolabeled molecules was then scored by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the immunocomplexes. Both pro-HGF and αβ-HGF coprecipitated with uPA after preincubation with the enzyme (Fig. 3), and the extent of coprecipitation increased with the time of preincubation (not shown). When the homobifunctional cross-linker DST was added at the end of the incubation, we also observed novel labeled Mr species in the immunoprecipitates made with anti-uPA antibodies. Their Mr was consistent with the covalent addition of one or both chains of HGF to one or both chains of uPA (Fig. 4). Thus, a stable complex between HGF and uPA can be isolated after their reaction.Figure 4:Identification of a stable complex of HGF with uPA in vitro. 1 nM 125 I-pro-HGF was incubated with or without 2 units of uPA for 2 h at 37°C in 100 μl of buffer, then 0.1 nM DST was added for 15 min. The samples were diluted in stop buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as such (lanes marked: total), or after immunoprecipitation with Sepharose-Protein A beads precharged with rabbit antibodies against uPA (α-uPA) or normal rabbit serum (nrs). The low concentration of cross-linker allowed for the resolution of several novel labeled bands in the immunoprecipitates of uPA (indicated with a, b, and c), together with the individual chains of processed HGF. Their Mr was consistent with the covalent addition of one or both chains of HGF to one or both chains of uPA. Protein molecular mass markers in kDa are shown on the right. The experiment shown is representative of three performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then asked whether HGF and uPA also formed a stable complex on the surface of target cells, which express receptors for both reactants. Monolayers of human A549 cells were sequentially incubated with two-chain uPA and 125 I-pro-HGF to saturate their surface receptors, washed, and exposed to a cross-linking agent. Then cells were extracted and immunoprecipitated either with anti-Met or anti-uPA antibodies. HGF coprecipitated both with its high-affinity Met receptor, and, to a lower extent, with uPA (Fig. 5A). Moreover, several cross-linked species were detected (Fig. 5B). Two high molecular weight species, previously identified with the cross-linked adducts of HGF with the Met receptor (indicated in the figure with a and b), were selectively precipitated by anti-Met antibodies. A third, lower molecular weight species (indicated with c), was selectively precipitated by anti-uPA antibodies. Its size was similar to that observed in the in vitro cross-linking experiments between HGF and uPA, cited above. A fourth, very high molecular weight form (indicated with d), was immunoprecipitated both by the anti-Met and anti-uPA antibodies. The precipitation pattern and the molecular size of the latter two species were consistent with the covalent addition of uPA to HGF alone, and, respectively, to HGF plus its Met receptor. The presence of uPA in these complexes was proved by control experiments in which the cell monolayers were rinsed with acidic buffer to remove most of the surface-bound uPA, prior to exposure to 125 I-pro-HGF. In these conditions, the c and d cross-linked species were sharply decreased (Fig. 5C). The presence of very high molecular weight form(s), which could hardly enter the gel, was also noted both in anti-uPA and anti-Met immunoprecipitates. Cross-linked adducts of higher molecular weight than HGF plus the Met receptor were also seen on other cell lines, such as the GTL16 cell lines, but were notably absent from insect Sf9 cells transfected with the Met receptor (not shown). In cultures of insect cells neither uPA nor its receptor are present, as the PA/plasmin system is only found in mammals. Thus, a stable complex of HGF with uPA is formed on the membrane of target cells. This complex is bound to the Met receptor, and possibly other molecules, such as the uPA receptor. We then asked whether pro-HGF was activated by endogenous uPA produced by cells in culture. We assayed a panel of primary and continuous cell lines for the processing of 125 I-pro-HGF added to the culture medium in serum-free conditions. Significant activation of pro-HGF in the culture medium was a peculiar feature of a small subset of cells, mainly exhibiting monocytic features. These cells are a rich source of enzymatically active uPA (Vassalli et al., 1984). Fig. 6 shows the processing of 125 I-pro-HGF into the bioactive heterodimer by human monocytic cell lines. U-937 and THP-1 cells were differentiated into a monolayer of adherent macrophage-like cells by treatment with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (Genton et al., 1987). To avoid interference from serum enzymes, the cells were cultured in the absence of serum for 24 h, and washed several times before using in the experiments. With U-937 cells, two-chain HGF was already detectable in the culture medium after 15 min of incubation (Fig. 6A). Pro-HGF was also processed by THP-1 cells, although less efficiently than U-937 cells (Fig. 6B). Correct processing of 125 I-pro-HGF was indicated by the Mr of the two chains and by the identical mobility of processed and unprocessed 125 I-HGF in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (not shown). With prolonged incubations, a lower Mr band was also noted, apparently derived from further processing of the α subunit. When undifferentiated U-937 and THP-1 cells were assayed, a similar but less efficient proteolytic cleavage of 125 I-pro-HGF was observed (not shown). In order to identify the enzyme(s) involved in the proteolytic cleavage of pro-HGF, we first showed that the processing activity was also detectable in the medium conditioned by incubation with the cells (Fig. 6C). U-937-conditioned medium was then challenged with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against uPA and with the protease inhibitor protease nexin 1 (PN-1), prior to incubation with 125 I-pro-HGF. As shown in Fig. 7, anticatalytic antibodies recognizing the B chain of uPA, and PN-1, effectively inhibited the proteolyt"

The Cdc24 protein is required both for proper bud-site selection and bud-site assembly and has been recently shown to display guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) activity toward Cdc42. Here, we demonstrate, using recombinant proteins, that Cdc24 can also bind directly to Rsr1. This binding has no effect on the ability of Rsr1 to undergo intrinsic or GEF-stimulated GDP-GTP exchange. However, Cdc24 can inhibit both the intrinsic and GTPase-activating protein-stimulated GTPase activity of Rsr1 and thereby acts as a GTPase-inhibitor protein for Rsr1. Cdc24 thus appears to bind preferentially to the activated form of Rsr1. The SH3 domain-containing bud-site assembly protein Bem1 also binds directly to Cdc24, and we show here that this interaction is inhibited by Ca 2+ . Neither Bem1 nor Cdc42 affects the GTPase-inhibitor protein activity of Cdc24 toward Rsr1, and neither Bem1 nor Rsr1 affects the GEF activity of Cdc24 toward Cdc42. Taken together, these results suggest that Cdc24 enables the direct convergence of a Ras-like protein (Rsr1) and a Rho-like protein (Cdc42) with the SH3-domain-containing protein (Bem1) and that independent domains of Cdc24 are responsible for these different interactions. These results also suggest that rather than directly controlling the GEF activity of Cdc24, the primary roles of Rsr1 and Bem1 might be to control the positioning of Cdc24 within the cell.

INTRODUCTIONProtein 4.1 is an 80-kDa peripheral membrane phosphoprotein that plays a pivotal role in regulating erythroid shape and membrane skeleton mechanical properties(1Takakuwa Y. Tchernia G. Rossi M. Benabadjii M. Mohandas N. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In many individuals suffering from hereditary elliptocytosis, primary defects in erythroid protein 4.1 cause aberrant morphology and hemolysis(2Tchernia G. Mohandas N. Shohet S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An explanation of these effects will require an understanding of how protein 4.1 binds to other membrane and cytoskeletal proteins(3Pasternack G.R. Anderson R.A. Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol.

Several studies have shown that an N-terminal 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 contains the membrane attachment site that interacts with transmembrane proteins(7Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol.

We recently showed that this 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 binds to both glycophorin C and p55(10Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8631-8634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence for this ternary complex comes from the study of subjects with either protein 4.1(-) hereditary elliptocytosis or the Leach phenotype where erythrocytes lack glycophorin C(11Chasis J.A.

The erythrocytes of these individuals display aberrant elliptocytic morphology, and exhibit a concomitant loss of p55 along with protein 4.1 and glycophorin C(12Alloisio N. Venezia N.D. Rana A.

The primary structure of p55 can be subdivided into three distinct domains: 1) an N-terminal domain that includes a single incomplete copy of the discs-large homologous region (DHR). In the Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor protein and other MAGUKs, there are three copies of the DHR domain(15Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The function of this domain is not known; 2) a central src homology 3 (SH3) domain which may mediate specific protein-protein interactions; and 3) a C-terminal domain that shows significant homology to the guanylate kinases(15Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Mech. Dev. 1993; 44: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 22Ruff P. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6595-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The function of this domain is not known.Here, we localize the sites in glycophorin C and p55 that bind the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. In glycophorin C, a 12-amino acid segment within the cytoplasmic domain binds the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. In p55, a novel charged motif flanked by the SH3 and guanylate kinase domains binds the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. A similarly charged motif is found in both the Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor protein and its human homologue. The significance of these findings is discussed in terms of the membrane localization of MAGUKs in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGlycophorin C PeptidesThe entire cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C contains 47 of glycophorin's 128 amino acid residues. Peptides P23 and P24 were synthesized by standard methods, and coupled to biotin at their amino termini. Peptides P12m, P12c, and P12a were coupled to biotin via an inert spacer sequence, SGSG (see Fig. 1). An irrelevant peptide with the sequence NELKKKASLF was included to determine the extent of nonspecific binding to the beads. The synthetic peptides were purified by analytical reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and the quality of purified peptides was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry.N-terminal, 125 I-Labeled, 30-kDa Domain of Protein 4.1Protein 4.1 was isolated using the procedure of Ohanian and Gratzer (23Ohanian V. Gratzer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) which yields pure protein, free of any contaminating protein kinases. Purified protein 4.1 was digested with α-chymotrypsin at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:25(7Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4603-4608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digestion was carried out on ice for 90 min in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After quenching the protease activity with 4.0 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate, the digested protein was fractionated on a Mono Q column using a linear gradient of 20-500 mM NaCl. The purified 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 was then radiolabeled with 125 I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent as described elsewhere (see Fig. 2)(24Ling E. Danilov Y.N. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2209-2216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2:Isolation of the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1.

The D5 fusion protein was used in the blot-overlay assay shown in Fig. 5. B, a comparison of the protein 4.1 binding region of p55 with similar sequences found in Dlg and Hdlg. Hdlg is the human homologue of the Drosophila tumor suppressor protein Dlg(16Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 34Lue R.A.

The triangle in the Hdlg sequence shows the beginning of the fusion protein which binds to protein 4.1(34Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In each case, the polymerase chain reaction product was ligated into the pGEX-2T vector which was expressed in Escherichia coli strains 71/18 or DH5α. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were then purified as described previously(10Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8631-8634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the cDNA constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis, and the identity of the recombinant proteins was established using polyclonal antibodies against p55 and its synthetic peptides.Blot Overlay AssayGST-p55 fusion proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The nitrocellulose blots were blocked with TBS-Tween buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 + 150 mM NaCl + 0.1% Tween 20 + 0.02% sodium azide) for 1 h, followed by an overnight incubation in the blocking buffer (TBS-Tween + 3% bovine serum albumin). The blots were incubated for 24 h at 4°C with the 125 I-labeled 30 kDa of protein 4.1 in the binding buffer (5.0 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1.0 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 120 mM KCl, 0.02% sodium azide and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The bound radioactivity was detected by autoradiography.Sedimentation AssayBiotinylated glycophorin C peptides were immobilized to the streptavidin agarose beads in the binding buffer for 2 h at 4°C. The beads with bound peptides were extensively washed with the binding buffer(10Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8631-8634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and blocked with 1.0 mg/ml of d-biotin in order to reduce nonspecific binding. The beads were incubated with the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 in the binding buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The amount of radioactivity sedimented with the beads was measured in a γ counter. For competition experiments, molar excess of competing molecules was added prior to the addition of the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 in the assay mixture. In all binding experiments, control beads with either no bound peptide or with an irrelevant peptide were used to account for the nonspecific binding. The binding of the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 to the GST-p55 fusion proteins was carried out as described previously(10Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8631-8634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).ELISAThe purified 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 was adsorbed to the plastic surface (Immulon 2 plate, Dynatech Labs. Inc.) for 2 h. The plate was blocked with the blocking buffer for 3 h at room temperature. The biotinylated peptides were dissolved in the blocking buffer (20.0 μg in each well) and incubated overnight in the ELISA plate at 4°C. The plate was washed extensively with the blocking buffer, and the amount of bound peptide was measured at 405 nm using the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate.RESULTSTo determine the protein 4.1 binding site on glycophorin C, peptides were synthesized corresponding to the defined segments of the cytoplasmic domain of human erythrocyte glycophorin C (Fig. 1). The cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C contains 47 amino acids(25Colin Y. Rahuel C. London J. Romeo P.-H. Auriol L. Galibert F. Cartron J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 229-233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide P23 consists of 23 amino acids including residue 82-104 of the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C. This segment of glycophorin C is proximal to the inner face of the erythroid plasma membrane. The P24 peptide, which lies distal to the plasma membrane, contains the remaining 24 amino acids (residue 105-128) of the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C. Biotinylated peptides were conjugated to the streptavidin agarose beads and used to quantify the binding of the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. The 30-kDa domain was produced after proteolytic digestion of purified protein 4.1, and its purity was examined by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 specifically binds to P23, the peptide proximal to the plasma membrane (Table 1). Binding was completely inhibited in the presence of a molar excess of the unlabeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. In contrast, no binding of the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain was detected with either P24 or an irrelevant peptide derived from dematin. These results were confirmed by an ELISA which was designed to measure the binding of peptides in solution to the immobilized 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 (Table 1).Tabled 1To further define the protein 4.1 binding site within the P23 peptide, two peptides were synthesized corresponding to the 23 amino acids of the P23 peptide (Fig. 1). Peptide P12 m consists of N-terminal 12 amino acids (residue 82-93), and the peptide P12c consists of the C-terminal 12 amino acids (residue 94-105). To determine the binding of peptides P12m and P12c to the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1, a binding inhibition assay was designed (Fig. 3). In this assay, the binding of P23 peptide to the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain was measured in the presence of either the P12m or P12c peptide. The peptide P12m quantitatively inhibited the binding of P23 peptide to the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 (Fig. 3). Half-maximal inhibition of P23 binding was achieved with 20 μM P12m. In contrast, no inhibition was observed with P12c (Fig. 3). These results show that the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 binds to glycophorin C in a region defined by the amino acids 82-93 (RYMYRHKGTYHT). Since this segment of the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C contains a cluster of positively charged residues i.e. RHK, we synthesized another peptide P12a where the RHK cluster was replaced by AAA. A comparison of the binding of peptides P12a and P12m to the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 indicated that the substitution of alanine (RYMYAAAGTYHT) for RHK completely abolished the association of the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 with peptide P12a (data not shown).Figure 3:Effects of the peptides P12c and P12m on the binding of the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 to the peptide P23. The binding of the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain to peptide P23 was measured using a sedimentation assay in the presence of increasing amounts of peptides P12c and P12m. The half-maximal inhibition of binding was achieved at 20 μM concentration of the peptide P12m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the binding site for protein 4.1 on p55, defined cDNA constructs of human erythroid p55 were expressed in bacteria as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (Fig. 4A). The binding of the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 to these constructs was measured by a blot overlay assay. The p55 constructs D1, D2, and D3 did not bind to the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 (Fig. 4B). The 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 bound specifically to the D4 construct which contains the guanylate kinase domain, the linker region, and the SH3 motif of p55 (Fig. 4A). The p55 constructs which contained either the guanylate kinase domain (D3) or the SH3 motif in isolation did not bind to the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 (Fig. 4A, data not shown).The results obtained by the blot overlay assay (Fig. 4B) were quantified using a sedimentation assay (Table 2). Again, the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 specifically bound to the construct D4. The binding capacity of the D4 was almost half that of the full-length p55, suggesting that the N-terminal undefined domain may be required to reconstitute the full binding capacity of intact p55. Alternatively, the undefined domain may contain a low affinity protein 4.1 binding site which we could not detect using the D1 construct under the given binding conditions. These results strongly suggest that the protein 4.1 binds to p55 within the region located between the SH3 and guanylate kinase domains.Tabled 1To confirm that the protein 4.1 binding site is located between the SH3 and guanylate kinase domains of p55, a GST fusion protein was produced that contained the 39 amino acids of this region (see Fig. 6, construct D5). The 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 specifically bound to the GST fusion protein (Fig. 5, lane 4), and this binding was completely abolished in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of the unlabeled 30-kDa domain. It is of interest to note that the partial degradation of the GST fusion protein produced a higher mobility band, as shown in Fig. 5(lane 3), and this truncated fusion protein did not bind to 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 (Fig. 5). Since both intact and truncated fusion proteins are recognized by anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies raised against the N-terminal half of the binding sequence (not shown), the degradation must have occurred at the C-terminal end of the fusion protein. The lack of protein 4.1 binding to the truncated fusion protein therefore suggests that residues located in the C-terminal half of the 39-amino acid region may be necessary for the binding of p55 to protein 4.1 (Fig. 6). The C-terminal half of the binding region is characterized by a cluster of lysine residues, which is also present in other MAGUKs that contain the conserved region, suggesting that a positively charged surface may mediate the binding of MAGUKs to protein 4.1.Figure 5:Binding of the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 to the p55 GST-fusion protein D5. The 39-amino acid sequence of p55, as shown in Fig. 6, was produced as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (D5). The binding of the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain was detected by a blot-overlay assay. Lanes 1 and 3, Ponceau S stain; and lanes 2 and 4, (autoradiography). Lanes 1 and 2, GST; and lanes 3 and 4, (GST-39 amino acids). Note that the GST-fusion protein in lane 3 is degraded producing a truncated protein. The truncated fusion protein does not bind to the 125 I-labeled 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur identification of the sequence RYMYRHKGTYHT as the binding site in glycophorin C for protein 4.1 is in agreement with the observations of Jons and Drenkhahn (26Jons T. Drenkhahn D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) showing that a positively charged sequence of band 3 mediates its binding to the N-terminal domain of protein 4.1. In the same study, it was shown that the purified protein 4.1 failed to bind to the stripped erythrocyte membrane vesicles in the presence of a peptide IRRRY. This observation again suggested the participation of positively charged residues in the binding of protein 4.1 to the membrane vesicles which contain both band 3 and glycophorins(26Jons T. Drenkhahn D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). While our studies were in progress, Hemming et.al. (27Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Mawby W.J. Reid M.E. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) showed that intact protein 4.1 binds to a 17-amino acid segment located within the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C. This 17-amino acid segment includes the 12-amino acid segment which we have identified in this study as the binding site for the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1.The determination of the protein 4.1 binding site on glycophorin C begins to explain how protein 4.1 and some of its homologues may interact with the plasma membrane via their conserved N-terminal 30-kDa domains. This result is consistent with the observation that ezrin, a member of the protein 4.1 superfamily, binds to the inner face of the fibroblast membrane via its N-terminal 30-kDa domain(28Algrain M. Turunen O. Vaheri A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that ezrin, moesin, and radixin associate with CD44, a 140-kDa integral membrane protein of broad distribution(29Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), and that ezrin precisely colocalizes with CD43 in the cleavage furrow of dividing leukocytes(30Yonemura S. Nagafuchi A. Sato N. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although CD44, CD43, and glycophorin C do not share any significant sequence similarity, all three are heavily glycosylated membrane proteins(29Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), and may represent alternative ways by which 4.1-related proteins associate with the membrane. Among red cell glycophorins, only glycophorin C is expressed in non-erythroid cells(13Kim C.L.V. Colin Y. Mitjavila M.-T. Clerget M. Dubart A. Nakazawa M. Vainchenker W. Cartron J-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20407-20414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we have found abundant expression of glycophorin C mRNA in human brain (data not shown). Whether other members of the protein 4.1 superfamily including protein tyrosine phosphatases PTP-MEG and PTP H1, and the brain tumor suppressor protein merlin/schwannomin, use a mechanism mediated by protein 4.1 to interact with the plasma membrane remains to be determined(31Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 32Trofatter J.A. colleagues Cell. 1993; 72: 791-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 33Rouleau G.A. colleagues Nature. 1993; 363: 515-52132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar).The results shown in Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6: identify a novel sequence located between the SH3 motif and the guanylate kinase domain of p55 as the binding site for the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. A characteristic of this 39-amino acid sequence is the presence of a cluster of lysine residues located in the C-terminal half of the protein (Fig. 6). The identification of the protein 4.1 binding site on human erythroid p55 suggests a mechanism by which members of the p55 superfamily may interact with the membrane cytoskeleton via protein 4.1. These results are consistent with the observation that p55 and its non-erythroid homologues are associated with the plasma membrane(22Ruff P. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6595-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar).The positively charged character and location of the protein 4.1 binding motif of p55 is conserved in both Dlg and Hdlg. The Drosophila protein is localized at the septate junctions (16Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B) as is a Drosophila homologue of protein 4.1(35Fehon R.G. Dawson L.A. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1994; 120: 545-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have demonstrated that both Hdlg and protein 4.1 localize at regions of cell-cell contact in the human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7(34Lue R.A. Marfatia S.M. Branton D. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9818-9822Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, protein 4.1 may provide a membrane localization site for Dlg homologues (35Fehon R.G. Dawson L.A. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1994; 120: 545-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other related MAGUKs. Similar, polybasic domains of Ras and nuclear lamins have previously been shown to direct these proteins to the plasma and nuclear membranes, respectively(36Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 37Lowinger L. Mckeon F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2301-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In fact, immunoreactive isoforms of protein 4.1 have been identified in the nuclei of several eukaryotic cells(38Correas I. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Whether the polybasic domains of p55 and its homologues mediate the targeting of these proteins to their respective membrane locales will be of considerable significance. Although our results identify the respective binding sites in vitro, it will now be important to use heterologous expression studies in eukaryotic cells to demonstrate these interactions in vivo. INTRODUCTIONProtein 4.1 is an 80-kDa peripheral membrane phosphoprotein that plays a pivotal role in regulating erythroid shape and membrane skeleton mechanical properties(1Takakuwa Y. Tchernia G. Rossi M. Benabadjii M. Mohandas N. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In many individuals suffering from hereditary elliptocytosis, primary defects in erythroid protein 4.1 cause aberrant morphology and hemolysis(2Tchernia G. Mohandas N. Shohet S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An explanation of these effects will require an understanding of how protein 4.1 binds to other membrane and cytoskeletal proteins(3Pasternack G.R. Anderson R.A. Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3676-3683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Anderson R.A. Lovrien R.E. Nature. 1984; 307: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 5Anderson R.A. Marchesi V.T.

Chem. 1986; 261: 3310-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that an N-terminal 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 contains the membrane attachment site that interacts with transmembrane proteins(7Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4603-4608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Leto T.L. Correas I. Tobe T. Anderson R.A. Horne W.C. Bennett V. Cohen C.M. Lux S.E. Palek J.

Red Blood Cell Membranes, Structure, Function, and Clinical Implications. Marcel Dekker, New York1989: 187-236Google Scholar). We recently showed that this 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 binds to both glycophorin C and p55(10Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8631-8634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further evidence for this ternary complex comes from the study of subjects with either protein 4.1(-) hereditary elliptocytosis or the Leach phenotype where erythrocytes lack glycophorin C(11Chasis J.A.

The primary structure of p55 can be subdivided into three distinct domains: 1) an N-terminal domain that includes a single incomplete copy of the discs-large homologous region (DHR). In the Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor protein and other MAGUKs, there are three copies of the DHR domain(15Woods D.F. Bryant P.J. Mech.

The function of this domain is not known.Here, we localize the sites in glycophorin C and p55 that bind the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. In glycophorin C, a 12-amino acid segment within the cytoplasmic domain binds the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. In p55, a novel charged motif flanked by the SH3 and guanylate kinase domains binds the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1. A similarly charged motif is found in both the Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor protein and its human homologue. The significance of these findings is discussed in terms of the membrane localization of MAGUKs in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells."

https://openalex.org/W2087390102,"The effect of insulin on expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) α, β, and δ was investigated in fully-differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment of adipocytes with insulin stimulated rapid dephosphorylation of C/EBPα, and repressed the expression of C/EBPα within 2-4 h, with >90% suppression occurring at 24 h. While insulin induced expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBP δ within 1 h and caused a >20-fold increase by 4 h, expression returned to nearly pretreatment levels by 24 h. The insulin concentration dependence of these effects was consistent with involvement of the insulin receptor. Gel shift analysis revealed that 6 h of insulin treatment decreased the binding of nuclear C/EBPα while increasing binding of nuclear C/EBPβ and C/EBP δ . The reciprocal effects of insulin on the steady-state levels of C/EBP transcription factors can be accounted for kinetically and quantitatively by changes in their mRNA levels, which can be accounted for by effects on gene transcription. The effects of insulin on adipocyte gene transcription (<i>e.g.</i> GLUT4) may be mediated, at least in part, by down-regulation of C/EBPα and/or its dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2016779630,"Several receptor tyrosine kinases generate soluble ligand binding domains either by differential splicing resulting in a truncated RNA transcript, or by proteolytic cleavage. Although the exact role in vivo of these soluble extracellular domains is unclear, proteolysis may function to down-regulate the receptor, and soluble extracellular domains (ECD) may compete with the intact receptor binding to ligand. Axl is a member of a new class of receptor tyrosine kinases characterized by an ECD resembling cell adhesion molecules and unique sequences in the kinase domain. In addition, Axl is transforming in both fibroblast and hematopoietic cells, and appears to be involved in mesenchymal development. We now find that Axl is post-translationally processed by cleavage in a 14 amino acid region immediately NH2-terminal to the transmembrane domain resulting in a soluble ECD and a membrane bound kinase domain. The sequence of this putative cleavage site shares no homology with recognition sites of known proteases. Characterization of this proteolytic processing shows that it does not require protein synthesis or transport but is augmented by phorbol ester treatment. Since the cleavage of Axl enhances turnover of the kinase on the cell surface, we suggest that proteolytic processing down-regulates Axl kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2006371812,"Transcriptional regulation of the steroid hormone receptor genes plays a central role in temporal changes of target cell sensitivity during development, maturation, and aging. Sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions mediate these regulatory functions. Progressive 5′ deletion of the rat androgen receptor (rAR) gene immediately beyond the −572 base pair (bp) region causes a marked increase in its promoter activity. DNase I footprinting with nuclear proteins revealed a protected area encompassing −574- to −554-bp positions that begins with a perfectly palindromic nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) motif. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses (EMSA) showed that the decameric rAR NF-κB site at positions −574 to −565 cross-competes with the authentic κ immunoglobulin light chain enhancer for specific protein binding. Supershift with specific antibodies to NF-κB subunits confirmed that the two retarded bands observed in the EMSA with the labeled rAR probe are due to p50/p65 and p50/p50 dimers of the NF-κB/Rel proteins. Fragments of rAR promoter with either deletion or point mutation of the NF-κB site are found to be about 2- to 3-fold more effective as compared to the wild type control in driving a heterologous reporter gene in cellulo. Thus, unlike most other known cases, NF-κB acts as a negative regulator for the rAR gene.

This observation suggested that, in addition to the positively acting factors mentioned above, a negative regulator may be interacting around the −572 region of this gene. Because of the age-dependent loss of hepatic androgen sensitivity, we were also interested in exploring the possible role of this negative regulator in the repression of the rAR gene activity during aging. The liver of the male rat produces a number of androgen-induced proteins in relatively large quantities, and the hepatic androgen sensitivity in this animal declines gradually with age (10Roy A.K.

Since then, a broader role of NF-κB in the regulation of many critical genes, especially those involved in immune response, inflammation, oxidative stress, and embryonic development, has been appreciated(12Nakayama K.

Fischer 344 male rats of different ages were obtained from the colony of the NIA, National Institutes of Health, maintained at Charles River Breeding Laboratories. Ages of rats were accurate within ±10 days. All animal care and treatment protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee. Animals were sacrificed and liver nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure described by Hattori et al.(17Hattori M. Tugores A. Veloz L. Karin M. Brenner D.

The upper strand of the duplex was end-labeled with [ γ - 32 32 P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled upper strand was annealed with a 5-fold excess of the unlabeled complementary strand. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were preincubated in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5-10% glycerol, and 1-2 μg of poly(dI-dC). After 5 min at room temperature, 10-20 fmol of 32 32 P-end-labeled oligonucleotide duplex probe was added, and the incubation was continued for another 20 min(9Supakar P.C. Song C.S. Jung M.H.

Following electrophoresis, dried gels were either autoradiographed or analyzed in Betascope.Tabled 1 For antibody supershifts, 1 μl of the polyclonal rabbit antiserum containing 0.05 μg of IgG was preincubated for 30 min at 22°C with the nuclear extract in the absence of poly(dI-dC). Subsequently, poly(dI-dC) was added and incubation continued for another 5 min, followed by addition of the 32 32 P-labeled probe and further incubation for 20 min. Specific antibodies to NF-κB subunits p50, p65, c-rel, and Rel B were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HeLa nuclear extracts (derived from control and phorbol ester-treated cells) were also obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Jurkat cell nuclear extracts with and without H2O2 treatment (150 μM, 60 min) were prepared as described(19Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A.

The plasmid containing 530 bp of the AR promoter (−1040 to −511) was cleaved with KpnI and HindIII restriction endonucleases. The cleaved insert (573 bp) containing the 530-bp rAR promoter was labeled by end-filling with [α- 32 32 P]dATP using Klenow DNA polymerase. Binding reactions were carried out using 50 μg of nuclear extract and ~ 2 ng (30,000-60,000 cpm) of probe. For homologous competition, a 333-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide duplex was preincubated with the nuclear extract. Following DNase I digestion, DNA fragments were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 M urea(9Supakar P.C. Song C.S. Jung M.H. Slomczynska M.A. Kim J.M. Vellanoweth R.L.

The parental plasmids pAR (1.04)-Luc and pAR (0.665)-Luc used in this study contain the wild type rat androgen receptor promoter from positions −1040 to +19 and −665 to +19, respectively, inserted into the luciferase vector pGL2-Enhancer(5Song C.S.

Deletion mutant as well as point mutant plasmids were used in this study. One mutant contains deletion at positions −574 to −554 within −665 bases of the AR promoter, pAR (0.665, Δ574/554)-Luc, and the second one has deletion at positions −574 to −565, pAR (0.665, Δ574/565)-Luc. The third mutant contains a base substitution at position −573, pAR (0.665, 573 G → C). For a four-point AR mutant, the luciferase plasmid, containing −1040 bases of the AR upstream sequences, was mutated at 4 consecutive bases from −574 to −571 (GGGA → ATCT) within the 10-bp NF-κB consensus sequence to create the mutant plasmid pAR (1.04, −574/-571 GGGA → ATCT). Site-specific deletions were created by ligation of DNA fragments lacking the desired nucleotide residues. The DNA fragments of choice resulted from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with appropriate primer pairs and the template DNA of the parental plasmid pAR (0.665)-Luc. For these two deletions, the ligated PCR fragments and corresponding primer pairs were as follows. Δ574/554: the 159-bp PCR fragment from the vector-specific GL1 primer and AR-specific antisense primer spanning positions −575 to −594 (5′-GACACCAAGCCATTTACTCT-3′) was ligated to a 653-bp DNA produced with the vector-specific GL2 primer and AR-specific sense primer spanning positions −553 to −531 (5′-CTGGAGGATCTCAAAGGTTTCTG-3′). Δ574/565: the same 159-bp DNA as above was ligated to a 664-bp PCR fragment from the vector-specific GL2 primer and AR-specific sense primer from −564 to −543 nucleotide residues (5′-CATCTACGCTACTGGAGGATCT-3′). The site-specific single point mutation was introduced initially on a DNA fragment generated by PCR using the plasmid template pAR (0.665)-Luc, in the presence of a mutant oligonucleotide primer spanning −609 to −561 positions containing a G → C substitution at position −573 and a downstream vector-specific GL-2 primer. The four point mutations were introduced on a DNA fragment generated by PCR of the plasmid template pAR (0.665)-Luc in the presence of the upstream primer spanning −609 to −561 with 4 consecutive base substitutions from −574 to −571 (GGGA → ATCT) and the downstream vector-specific GL2 primer. The mutant DNA fragments generated by PCR were digested with ApaI and purified by gel electrophoresis. Gel-purified primers were also used in all PCR experiments. The vector-specific GL1 and GL2 primers were from Promega Biotech, and the AR-specific primers were customsynthesized by the Midland Company. For the final construction of mutant plasmids, the wild type AR promoter fragments in the parental plasmids pAR (0.665)-Luc and pAR (1.04)-Luc were replaced by the mutant promoter fragments via the two ApaI sites at −604 and −459 positions of the rAR promoter sequence. All mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Plasmid DNAs were purified through the Qiagen anion exchange resin, and plasmid concentrations were verified both by UV absorbance at 260 nm and by ethidium bromide staining following gel electrophoresis. Different cell lines used in this study were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Hank's F-12 medium (1:1, v/v) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. T25 flasks were seeded with 500,000 cells and cultured overnight before transfection. Test plasmids (10 μg) were transfected into cells by the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method(20Kimura A. Israel A. LeBail O. Kourilsky P. Cell. 1986; 44: 261-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity (21deWet J.R. Wood K.V. Deluca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar), and light emission was quantified in a Bio-Orbit 1250 luminometer. Protein concentrations of cell extracts were measured using the Bradford assay, and transfection results were computed as luciferase activities per mg of total protein. Transfections of the progressively deleted rAR promoter have indicated that sequences immediately downstream of the −572 region may contain a negative regulatory element. In order to identify the existence of any specific protein binding site around this region, we have conducted DNase I footprinting analysis with liver nuclear extract and an end-labeled promoter fragment spanning the −1040 to −511 region of the rAR gene (Fig. 1). One of the footprints revealed in this experiment covered a 21-bp region encompassing positions −574 to −554. This protection is lost when a 333-fold molar excess of an oligonucleotide duplex corresponding to the −574 to −554 region was added as a competitor of the labeled DNA (Fig. 1, lane 4), substantiating the sequence specificity of the binding protein. Nuclear extracts from a number of heterologous sources including human (HeLa cells) were also effective in protecting the same footprint region (not shown in this figure). A computer search of the transcription factor data base revealed that the 5′ half of the 21-bp protected region shown in Fig. 1 conforms to the 10-base pair consensus binding sequence of NF-κB and differs from the mouse immunoglobulin κ chain enhancer (NF-κB site) at two positions (Table 1). However, these variant positions are not critical for specific binding of NF-κB to its cognate cis-element(22Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, this rAR element possesses a perfect dyad symmetry in contrast to other naturally occurring NF-κB motifs(14Liou H.-C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Binding specificity of NF-κB to the 21-bp protected region identified by DNase I footprinting was further characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA). A labeled oligonucleotide duplex corresponding to the footprinted site produced two retarded bands (Fig. 2). Both of these retarded bands could be competed with a 100-fold molar excess of either the unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide duplex (21-mer) or with a 22-mer oligonucleotide containing the wild type mouse immunoglobulin κ chain enhancer element (lanes 2 and 3). However, the mutant oligonucleotide with a critical G → C substitution (Table 1) failed to compete with the labeled probe for protein binding (lane 4). Furthermore, specific protein binding of the labeled mouse Ig κ oligonucleotide can be blocked with an excess of either the unlabeled rAR 21-mer oligonucleotide (lane 6) or the homologous NF-κB oligonucleotide (lane 7), but not with the mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide. These results indicate that in the two retarded bands, the proteins binding to the labeled rAR oligonucleotide have binding specificity similar to those binding to the mouse Ig κ enhancer. The labeled Ig κ oligonucleotide produced two additional retarded bands (marked with asterisks), and binding was substantially reduced by competition with the homologous oligonucleotide (lane 7), but not with an excess of the rAR oligonucleotide (lane 6). Since the rAR oligonucleotide did not generate these two additional bands, we have not explored them further. The two slower migrating specific bands produced with the labeled rAR oligonucleotide (−574/-554) can also be eliminated by excess truncated 12-mer oligonucleotide duplex corresponding to positions −574 to −563 of the rAR gene (not shown in this figure). Identity of the nuclear factors that interact with this particular region of the rAR promoter was further authenticated by antibody supershift experiments. Results presented in Fig. 3 show that the antibody which is specific for the p50 subunit of NF-κB supershifted all of the faster migrating lower band and removed some of the upper complex (lane 2). The antibody specific for p65, on the other hand, selectively reduced the slower migrating upper band (lane 3). Antibodies to c-rel and Rel B did not have any effect on either of these two bands (lanes 4 and 5). Similar reactivity to antibodies against p50 and p65 was also observed when an oligonucleotide containing the mouse Ig κ enhancer was used as the labeled probe (lanes 7-10). These results, in conjunction with observations of Fujita et al.(23Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) with respect to relative electrophoretic mobilities of protein-DNA complexes of various recombinantly produced NF-κB subunits, allow us to conclude that the faster migrating retarded band may contain a homodimer of p50 while the slower migrating upper band is most likely due to the binding of a p50/p65 heterodimer. Selective removal of the upper band with the p65 antibody rather than its supershifting may be due to the formation of a microprecipitate in the reaction tube. Conclusions concerning the identities of the two retarded bands were also substantiated by observations that (i) the protein-DNA complex generated by the recombinantly produced p50 and the labeled −574/-554 rAR oligonucleotide co-migrates with the lower band (not shown here) and (ii) a large increase of the upper band was observed for the H2O2-treated Jurkat cell nuclear extract that is known to contain a highly induced level of the p50/p65 heterodimer (shown in Fig. 5)(19Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar, 22Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5:Differential increase in p50/p50 and p50/p65 forms of NF-κB during aging and after activation with phorbol ester and H2O2.

B, preferential increase in p50/p65 heterodimer activity in PMA-treated HeLa cells (lanes 1 and 2) and in H2O2-treated Jurkat cells (lanes 3 and 4). For both A and B, rAR −574/-554 oligonucleotide duplex was used as the labeled probe. In order to maintain a visible separation between p50/p50 and p50/p65 complexes, even at elevated concentrations, the x-ray films were intentionally underexposed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having established the authenticity of the NF-κB binding site at the upstream region of the rAR gene, we wanted to examine its regulatory function. DNA constructs containing different versions of the rAR gene promoter ligated to the firefly luciferase structural gene were transfected into CHO cells. Promoters used for these experiments were as follows: (i) the wild type rAR promoter containing up to a −665-bp segment of the gene (665 WT), (ii) a point mutant of the 665 WT containing G → C substitution at position −573 (665 G → C); (iii) a deletion mutant that contained the wild type sequence up to −665 with a 10-bp NF-κB deletion spanning positions −574 to −565 (665Δ10); (iv) a deletion mutant that contained upstream sequences up to −665, but lacked the entire 21-bp DNase I protected region spanning positions −574 to −554 (665Δ21); (v) a longer promoter segment containing up to −1040 bp in its wild type form (1040 wt); and (vi) a mutant form of the −1040-bp promoter (1040:4 Pmt) containing 4 base substitutions within the NF-κB site (GGGA → ATCT). Results in Fig. 4 show that all four mutant promoters, with either base substitutions or deletions at the NF-κB site, were approximately 2-3-fold more effective in driving the expression of the luciferase reporter gene compared to the wild type control. From these results and the promoter activities of deletion mutants described before(5Song C.S. Her S. Slomczynska M. Choi S.J. Jung M.H. Roy A.K. Chatterjee B. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we conclude that the NF-κB site on the rAR promoter functions as a negative regulatory element in transfected cells. We have repeated these experiments with other cell lines besides CHO, including COS-1 and HepG2 cells. With these cells, although the extent of increase of the NF-κB-deleted promoter varied to some extent, in all cases the mutant promoters were more effective in driving the reporter gene as compared to the wild type control. The physiological relevance of these in vitro studies to the age-dependent decline in rAR gene expression was explored by examining the hepatic levels of NF-κB in aging rats. Results presented in Fig. 5A demonstrate a gradual age-dependent increase in the NF-κB binding activity in the liver. The nuclear extract from the liver of a 26-month-old senescent male rat which shows a markedly reduced AR gene expression(9Supakar P.C. Song C.S. Jung M.H. Slomczynska M.A. Kim J.M. Vellanoweth R.L. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26400-26408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) , contains an approximately 10-fold higher NF-κB binding activity as compared to the young adult (3-month-old) control. These results suggest that NF-κB may play an important role in the coordinated down-regulation of the rAR gene in the liver. The hepatic NF-κB activity increases under conditions of inflammation, and older animals are known to be more susceptible to chronic inflammatory responses relative to their younger counterparts. Furthermore, acute inflammatory response preferentially increases the p50/p65 heterodimeric form of NF-κB over the p50/p50 homodimer(19Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar, 22Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). It was, therefore, of interest to explore any possible difference between the age-dependent increase in the hepatic NF-κB activity and an acute inflammatory response. Results presented in Fig. 5A show that aging causes a preferential increase in the hepatic level of the p50/p50 homodimer. However, as expected, both HeLa cells treated with phorbol myristic acetate (an activator of protein kinase C and inflammatory response) and Jurkat T cells treated with H2O2 (an agent that causes oxidative stress) markedly increased the nuclear level of the p50/p65 heterodimeric form of NF-κB (Fig. 5B). These results suggest a subtle difference between the pathways that mediate the age-dependent rise in the NF-κB activity and the acute inflammatory response. The NF-κB/Rel family constitutes a group of dimeric transcriptional regulators containing an approximately 300-amino acid long highly conserved Rel homology (RH) domain. About 12 different dimeric combinations of the five well-characterized subunits have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of a number of genes that, among others, are involved in immune response, inflammation, acute phase response, and embryonic differentiation(14Liou H.-C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). It appears that the homologous RH domain provides both the DNA binding and dimerization sites, and the nonhomologous segments of the component subunits along with the overall dimeric protein conformation may primarily be responsible for the transcriptional regulation(23Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Individual members of NF-κB subunits possess different affinities for the cytoplasmic sequestering protein IκB which can be inactivated by phosphorylation (14Liou H.-C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Thus, the ultimate trans-regulatory effects of various dimeric species of NF-κB/Rel on a particular gene will depend on the cellular levels of the subunits and IκB, the binding affinity of the response element for the available dimeric forms, the intrinsic subunit-specific transregulatory capacity, and the interaction with other non-Rel proteins functioning as co-activators or co-repressors. Earlier studies of Fujita et al.(23Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) have shown that among various NF-κB/Rel dimers, the p50/p50 possesses the highest affinity for the decameric mouse κ immunoglobulin light chain response element while p50/p65, a weaker binder, provides stronger transactivation. Furthermore, the differential DNA binding ability of p50/p50 over p50/p65 increases as the dyad symmetry of the binding site nears perfection(23Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 24Urban M.B. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In this article we report evidence for a naturally occurring perfectly palindromic binding site for NF-κB. Judging from the results of Fujita et al.(23Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), this rAR element will possess anywhere between 5- and 10-fold higher affinity for p50/p50 than its more potent trans-activating homolog p50/p65. Since p50/p50 and p50/p65 appear to be the predominant forms of NF-κB/Rel in liver nuclear extracts, in the absence of other determining factors, the p50/p50 homodimer may preferentially occupy the rAR element in vivo. In aging animals, such a preferential occupancy of the NF-κB site on the rAR promoter will be further ensured by the age-dependent increase in the p50/p50 homodimer. Despite its generally recognized transactivating function, several lines of evidence have already suggested the potential repressor role of the p50/p50 homodimer. Based on the results of co-transfection, experiments with a basal promoter containing multimerized NF-κB elements and NF-κB expression vectors, Schmitz and Baeuerle (25Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) concluded that the homodimer of p50 has the potential of down-regulating κB-specific genes. A similar indication was also obtained in transgenic mice containing three copies of Ig κ enhancer in front of a β-globin reporter gene(26Lernbecher T. Muller U. Wirth T. Nature. 1993; 365: 767-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the latter case, the authors observed that organs that only contain the p50 homodimer failed to express the transgene. More recently, Brown et al.(27Brown A.M. Linhoff M.W. Stein B. Wright K.L. Baldwin A.S. Basta P.V. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2926-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have provided evidence for the possible role of p50 homodimer in the cell-specific down-regulation of the major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant chain mRNA. However, the mechanism of the inhibitory function of the p50/p50 homodimer at this point remains speculative. It is possible that the repressor function may require the help of some other DNA binding protein that can act as a co-repressor. The Drosophila homolog of the NF-κB/Rel family, known as dorsal (dl), simultaneously functions as an activator for regulatory genes such as twist and snail and as a repressor for genes such as decapentaplegic (dpp) and Zerknütt (Zen)(15Jiang J. Cai H. Zhou Q. Levine M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3201-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) . Genes that are negatively regulated by dl contain a minimal 110-bp ventral response element. In addition to two dl binding sites, the ventral response element contains several co-repressor binding sites that are essential for repression. Mutations in some of these co-repressor binding sites convert the minimal ventral response element into an activator element. Such a mechanism may also be possible for the p50/p50-mediated repression of the rAR gene. If a co-repressor, bound to a noncontiguous site at the 3′ end of the NF-κB site, interacts with the p50/p50 homodimer through DNA looping and protein-protein interaction, that may also explain the 11-base pair 3′ extension of the footprint site beyond the decameric NF-κB site on the rAR gene. It is noteworthy that band shift with oligonucleotide duplexes containing the entire footprint region did not produce any additional retarded bands other than the NF-κB complexes, suggesting that proteins that confer the extended protection may require downstream DNA sequences for stabilization. The age-dependent decline in rAR gene expression appears to be coordinated by more than one trans-regulator. In addition to the negative regulatory influence of NF-κB and the increase of the p50/p50 binding activity during aging, we have recently described the positive regulatory role of a novel age-dependent factor (ADF) in the down-regulation of the rAR gene(9Supakar P.C. Song C.S. Jung M.H. Slomczynska M.A. Kim J.M. Vellanoweth R.L. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26400-26408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADF is an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor whose activity in the liver nuclear extract declines about 7-fold during aging (from 3 months to 26 months). Deletion or point mutation of the ADF binding site on the rAR gene promoter causes a 5-fold decline in the promoter activity in transfected cells. However, an approximate 70-fold decline in the steady state level of rAR mRNAs in the liver of senescent rats relative to the young adult control may require the coordinated action of NF-κB, ADF, and even some other as yet unidentified contributing factors. Reactive oxygen intermediates serve as the major activating signal for NF-κB(19Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar, 22Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). The hypothesis that a cumulative cellular damage produced by oxygen radicals is one of the major driving forces for aging (28Harman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) has recently been strengthened by the observation that simultaneous overexpression of superoxide dismutase and catalase in transgenic flies lengthens their life span(29Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). A progressive dysregulation of the inflammatory response also appears to be one of the phenotypic changes associated with aging(30Post D.J. Carter K.C. Papaconstantinou J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 621: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to assume that the ubiquitous transregulator NF-κB can serve as the common signal carrier for both oxidative damage and inflammation and influence age-dependent dysfunctions.

https://openalex.org/W2056882263,"Experiments with mutant Escherichia coli cells lacking phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as a membrane component (DeChavigny, A., Heacock, P. N., and Dowhan, W.(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5323-5332) were carried out to establish whether or not PE is necessary for full function of the lac permease in vivo. The Vmax for active transport of both lactose (in cells lacking β-galactosidase, lacZ) and the unhydrolyzable lactose analog, methyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (TMG), by mutant cells lacking PE was reduced 5-10-fold relative to cells containing PE, while the Km for the uptake of both substrates was the same in both types of cells. The low rate of TMG and lactose uptake by PE-deficient cells was unaffected by the presence of a protonophore (uncoupler) and for TMG uptake was on the order of the greatly reduced rate of uptake in uncoupler-treated cells containing PE. The rate of entry of lactose into lacZ + derivatives of both types of cells, as a measure of facilitated diffusion, was nearly the same. The Km for lactose (lacZ cells) and TMG transport in PE-deficient cells was unaffected by the presence of an uncoupler which had a small effect on Vmax. In PE-containing cells these kinetic parameters for TMG transport were reduced by an uncoupler to the level found with PE-deficient cells while an uncoupler reduced lactose uptake by PE-containing (lacZ) cells to below measureable levels. Inverted membrane vesicles made from both types of cells could be loaded with TMG, but energizing TMG-loaded vesicles by ATP only induced rapid, uphill, permease-dependent efflux of TMG from PE-containing vesicles. The decrease in apparent active transport activity of cells with no PE was not due to a change in membrane permeability, to a reduced Δμ H+ (proton electrochemical gradient) across the cell membrane, or to a reduced level of membrane-associated lac permease protein. These results suggest that in the absence of PE the lac permease cannot couple substrate uptake to Δμ H+ in order to effect accumulation of substrate and as a result only carries out facilitated diffusion. Experiments with mutant Escherichia coli cells lacking phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as a membrane component (DeChavigny, A., Heacock, P. N., and Dowhan, W.(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5323-5332) were carried out to establish whether or not PE is necessary for full function of the lac permease in vivo. The Vmax for active transport of both lactose (in cells lacking β-galactosidase, lacZ) and the unhydrolyzable lactose analog, methyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (TMG), by mutant cells lacking PE was reduced 5-10-fold relative to cells containing PE, while the Km for the uptake of both substrates was the same in both types of cells.

Inverted membrane vesicles made from both types of cells could be loaded with TMG, but energizing TMG-loaded vesicles by ATP only induced rapid, uphill, permease-dependent efflux of TMG from PE-containing vesicles. The decrease in apparent active transport activity of cells with no PE was not due to a change in membrane permeability, to a reduced Δμ H+ (proton electrochemical gradient) across the cell membrane, or to a reduced level of membrane-associated lac permease protein. These results suggest that in the absence of PE the lac permease cannot couple substrate uptake to Δμ H+ in order to effect accumulation of substrate and as a result only carries out facilitated diffusion. Transport of β-galactosides into Escherichia coli is catalyzed by the product of the lacY gene, the lac permease. In the presence of a proton electrochemical gradient (Δμ H+ mease utilizes the energy released from the downhill movement of hydrogen ion into the cell to drive co-translocation of β-galactosides uphill against a concentration gradient. The lac permease is a polytopic cytoplasmic membrane protein with 12 α-helical transmembrane hydrophobic domains connected by hydrophilic loops alternately exposed on the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides of the membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 1 and 2). This common structural motif for many prokaryotic and eukaryotic transporters (3) makes results obtained from studies on the lac permease applicable to a variety of other transport proteins. The function, membrane topology, and assembly of the lac permease has been the subject of numerous detailed investigations utilizing biochemical, physical chemical, and molecular genetic approaches(2Kaback H.R. Jung K. Jung H. Wu J. Prive G.G. Zen K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 627-636PubMed Google Scholar, 4Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 5-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, only a limited number of reports address the role of the native phospholipid environment in the assembly and function of this transporter. In most studies on the lipid requirement of transport systems, the carrier has been extracted from the membrane (5In't Veld G. deVrije T. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1104: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) followed by reconstitution of the transport system into liposomes of different phospholipid compositions. Reconstituted lac permease showed a near absolute dependence of active transport, but not downhill facilitated diffusion, on proteoliposomes containing the amino-based zwitterionic phospholipids PE or phosphatidylserine(6Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10150-10158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Seto-Young D. Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 84: 256-267Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, limitations of this in vitro approach are that differences observed between the various phospholipids employed might be due to variability in the incorporation efficiency of the transport protein into proteoliposomes of different compositions, in the ability of proteoliposomes to maintain an artificially imposed Δμ H+ , in the ability to form sealed proteoliposomes, and in proteoliposomal internal volumes. The extraction and reconstitution procedures can also affect native conformation of reconstituted proteins. Even mild approaches to altering phospholipid composition such as fusion of membrane vesicles and liposomes (8Driessen A.J.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12438-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and nonspecific lipid transfer protein-based methods (9Kusters R. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8659-8662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have the disadvantage that endogenous lipids remain present in the membranes and the natural lipid asymmetry of the membrane may not be maintained. Finally, in all in vitro reconstituted systems influence of dynamic metabolism on regulation and function is not present or testable. What is generally lacking in this area are extensive studies of these carriers in vivo in membranes with systematically controlled variations in phospholipid composition. Limited data on the effect of alterations in phospholipid metabolism on the in vivo properties of the lac permease system have been reported. Accumulation of phosphatidylserine to about 20% of the total phospholipid of E. coli in a temperature-sensitive mutant of the psd gene (encoding phosphatidylserine decarboxylase) had little effect on the properties of the endogenous lac permease(10Hawrot E. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8213-8220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with the in vitro data(6Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10150-10158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Seto-Young D. Chen C.-C. Wilson T.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 84: 256-267Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The use of the existing conditional lethal mutants in E. coli phospholipid metabolism is complicated by the necessity of separating the pleiotrophic effects brought about by cell growth arrest or cell death from the specific effects on transport systems. The recent development of a series of mutants in which dramatic changes in phospholipid composition can be made under conditions which allow for cell growth and viability has opened up the possibility of more systematic studies on the role of specific phospholipids and phospholipid composition in cell processes in vivo(9Kusters R. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8659-8662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dowhan W.

In order to initiate studies on the in vivo role of phospholipids in lac permease assembly and function, we utilize in this report strains carrying the pss93::kan null allele (normally encodes phosphatidylserine synthase) which renders the cell devoid of the zwitterionic amino-based phospholipids phosphatidylserine and PE (14DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results support the previously reported in vitro requirement for PE in the functioning of the lac permease particularly in proton-coupled active transport.

[14C]DMO and rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the C-terminal dodecapeptide of lac permease were generous gifts of Dr. H. R. Kaback (University of California, Los Angeles). Table 1 summarizes the strains and plasmids used in this work. Strains carrying the pss93::kan null allele require either a functional plasmid-borne copy of the pss gene (plasmid pDD72, temperature sensitive for replication) or growth media containing 30-50 mM MgCl2 for viability(14DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type control strain (PE-containing) was a pss93::kan null allele-containing strain (PE-deficient) carrying plasmid pDD72; strains lacking PE had the expected phospholipid composition (14DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of 65% phosphatidylglycerol, 13% cardiolipin, and 18% phosphatidic acid. Strains with mutant lacY or lacZ genes were constructed using phage P1vir transduction (16Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) to transfer the lacY328 allele from strain M7044 to strain AD90/pDD72. Transductants defective in the lac operon were selected for by their resistance to the metabolic poison TONPG when grown on succinate minimal medium(17Smith T.F. Sadle J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 59: 273-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); the phenotypes were confirmed by the lack of ONPG hydrolysis by whole cells (lacY strain) and the lack of β-galactosidase activity in cell extracts (lacZ strain). Strains were made recA by P1 transduction of the closely linked srl::Tn10 marker of strain GE2046 followed by screening for UV sensitivity(18Maniatis T. Fritsh E.P. Sambrook F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Strains were cured of plasmid pDD72 as described previously(14DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Cells were grown in either liquid medium or on agar plates composed of LB rich medium (10 g of Bactopeptone, 5 g of Bacto-yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl/liter). Antibiotics were included in the growth medium where necessary for strain selection or maintenance of plasmids(18Maniatis T. Fritsh E.P. Sambrook F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar); only ampicillin selection was utilized for PE-deficient strains. Since replication of plasmid pDD72 is temperature-sensitive and mutants lacking PE require MgCl2 for viability, all strains (mutant and wild type) were grown at 30°C in 50 mM MgCl2 unless otherwise noted. For transport assays and membrane preparations fresh overnight cultures were diluted 50-fold and allowed to grow in LB medium to an A600 of 0.25 before induction with either 0.2 mM IPTG for lac permease expression from the chromosomal copy of the gene or 1 mM IPTG for the expression from the copy of the gene carried by plasmid pT7-5/lacY unless otherwise noted. After additional growth in exponential phase for one generation, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet of cells grown in exponential phase in LB medium was resuspended to a concentration of A600 = 15 in 100 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5) containing 25 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Total cell lysates were prepared by subjecting the cell suspensions to a single passage through a motor-driven French pressure cell to form IMV(20Reenstra W.W. Patel L. Ruttenberg H. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); undisrupted cells and outer membrane vesicles were removed from the lysate by centrifugation at 30,000 × gav for 20 min. The inner membrane fraction (as IMV) was then collected by centrifugation at 200,000 × gav for 1 h and resuspended in the original buffer containing 250 mM sucrose to a protein concentration of 15-20 mg/ml; aliquots were stored at −80°C for subsequent use. Transport of radiolabeled lactose (0.1-0.4 μCi/ml) and radiolabeled TMG (0.1-0.4 μCi/ml) at final concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 mM was assayed in intact cells as described previously (21Consler T.G. Tsolas O. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) except 30 mM MgCl2 was added to the assay mixture and stop solution. Under conditions where uninduced cells retained about 200 dpm of substrate (10-fold over background) the amount of radiolabel retained by IPTG-induced cells ranged from 1200 to 50,000 dpm/assay. The initial rates of transport were determined from time points taken during the first 5 min of the assay where the initial rate of transport was linear. Kinetic constants (Vmax and Km) derived from the Michaelis-Menton equation were the average of three determinations utilizing DeltaGraph ™ Pro version 3.0 (DeltaPoint, Inc.) for curve fitting; the graphical representation reported in each case was of one typical experiment. Cells, grown as described above, were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold 100 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5) or in LB medium containing both 30 mM MgCl2 and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) to an A600 of 10 (about 0.8-1.0 mg of protein/ml) and kept on ice until used. Individual aliquots (0.1 ml) of the cell suspension were used for each time point and reactions were carried out at room temperature in plastic tubes. The assay was initiated by addition of radioactive substrate and stopped by addition of 3 ml of 100 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5), 100 mM LiCl, and 30 mM MgCl2 followed by rapid filtration through glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/F). The filters were washed once with stop solution (10 ml) and radioactivity trapped on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. De-energized cells were obtained by pretreating the cells with 50 μM of the uncoupler, FCCP, for 10 min prior to assaying transport in the presence of uncoupler (22Ghazi A. Schechter E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 645: 305-315Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transport by IMV was determined as described previously (23Lancaster Jr., J.R. Hinkle P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7657-7661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For assay, IMV were diluted into 0.5 ml of 100 mM HEPES/KOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 15 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose, 20 mM KCl to make a final concentration of 2.5 mg of protein/ml. The assay mixture was supplemented with 10 mM phosphoenolpyruvate and 0.05 mg/ml phosphoenolpyruvate kinase. The IMV were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 0.4 mM radioactive TMG (5 μCi/ml). ATP (3 mM final concentration) was then added and samples (50 μl) were transferred to stop solution (0.15 ml of 10 mM HgCl2) at various times followed immediately by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (100 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5) containing 20 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mg of poly-L-lysine (Mr = 10, 500)). The resulting flocculant suspensions were collected on 0.1-μm Gelman Super-100 filters, washed with 5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (no polylysine), and dried. The radioactivity trapped on the filters was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. In control experiments with 32 P-labeled IMV, it was found that IMV do not pass through the filters under the above conditions. Total French pressure cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of cold 0.1 or 0.2 N NaOH, vortexed, and separated into a pellet and supernatant fraction by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 18,000 × gav for 15 min at 4°C(24Ito K. Akiyama Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Aliquots of whole lysate, pellet (suspended in water), and supernatant were adjusted to a final concentration of 10% trichloroacetic acid and the resulting protein precipitates washed with acetone followed by solubilization in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described below. Cells induced for expression of the lac operon were harvested during mid-log phase of growth by centrifugation at 1000 × gav for 7 min and resuspended in the 100 mM MES/NaOH buffer (pH 5.5) containing 30 mM MgCl2 to an A600 of 10-15 (1.0-1.5 mg of cell protein/ml). The difference in pH across the membrane of the cells was measured by determining the difference in the amount of radiolabeled DMO associated with cells before (energized cells) and after (de-energized cells) treatment with 1.7% toluene; this approach provides a correction for nonspecific binding of DMO. At 25°C steady-state distribution of DMO was obtained within 2 min and remained constant for at least 10 min. After 3 min of incubation, 0.5-ml samples (1 mg of cell protein) were removed from the reaction mixtures (cells suspended in 100 mM MES/KOH (pH 5.5), 150 mM KCl, 16 mM succinate, [14C]DMO (0.25 μCi/ml, 60 μM final concentration), 30 mM MgCl2) and layered onto 0.15 ml of 22% perchloric acid and 0.50 ml of silicone oil (d = 1.05, Aldrich) in microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifugated through the silicone oil in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 14,000 × gav for 5 min at room temperature; a de-energized sample was treated in the same way. After centrifugation, 0.05-ml samples of the perchloric acid phase and the supernatant remaining above the silicon oil were removed for scintillation counting. The internal pH (pHin ) was calculated from the Nernst equation (25Maloney P.C. Kashket E.R. Wilson T.H. Meth. Membr. Biol. 1975; 5: 1-49Google Scholar) as follows: pHin=pKa+log{[DMOinDMOout]⋅[10pHout-pKa+1]-1}(Eq. 1) where pKa is the negative logarithm of the apparent ionization constant of DMO (approximately 6.32 at 25°C), pHout is the extracellular pH, DMOin is the intracellular concentration of DMO, DMOout is the extracellular concentration of DMO. The intracellular water volume was taken as 6.34 μl/mg of cell protein(26Bogdanov M. Nesmeyanova M. Doklady Biochem. 1986; 288: 200-203Google Scholar). The ΔpH is the difference between pHin and pHout (alkaline inside). The above method was also used to verify that 50 μM FCCP fully de-energized cells at extracellular pH 5.5 and 150 mM potassium ion. Membrane fractions prepared as described above, protein precipitates, or whole cell lysates were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 2.8% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mM dithiothreitol and heated at 37°C for 20 min prior to being subjected to PAGE in 12.5% polyacrylamide(27Newman M.J. Foster D.L. Wilson T.H. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11804-11808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schuel) by electroblotting for 90 min using a semi-dry electroblotting system (Milliblot-SDE Electroblotting apparatus). The nitrocellulose sheets were then blocked overnight with 5% bovine serum albumin in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the C-terminal dodecapeptide of lac permease was added at a final dilution of 1:2500 in the same blocking solution and incubated for an additional hour. The sheets were washed 3 times with TBS buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl) for 15 min each and then 3 times with TBS buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min each. The washed sheets were incubated in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 35 S-labeled Protein A (0.1 μCi/ml, 320 Ci/mmol) for 1 h followed by six 15-min washes with TBS and TBS/Nonidet P-40 buffers. The dried sheets were scanned for radiolabel and quantified using a Betagene Imager. Protein was determined by the BCA assay method according to the manufacturers suggestions, and β-galactosidase was assayed using cells pretreated with toluene, as described by Miller(16Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Labeling of phospholipids in vivo with 32 PO4 was carried out as described previously(14DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of PE-deficient cells to import and metabolize lactose was assessed qualitatively by growing the cells on MacConkey indicator plates containing 25 mM lactose(16Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Cells expressing functional lacY and lacZ gene products can import and hydrolyze lactose and subsequent metabolism of the monosaccharides causes acidification of the surrounding agar which results in purple-red colonies. Strains carrying the null pss93 allele and either lacking (PE-deficient) or containing (PE-containing) plasmid pDD72 form purple-red colonies on the above plates. These indicator plates only establish downhill lactose transport and give no indication as to whether or not cells catalyze active accumulation against a concentration gradient(28Sahin-Toth M. Kaback H.R. Prot. Sci. 1993; 2: 1024-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In order to examine the ability of the cells lacking PE to actively transport β-galactosides against a concentration gradient, their ability to accumulate lactose and its non-metabolizable analog TMG was investigated. As shown in Fig. 1, fully energized PE-containing and PE-deficient cells can both take up TMG at subsaturating concentrations (0.1-0.5 mM); however, the initial rate of uptake by PE-deficient cells was 8- to 10-fold lower than that for wild type cells whether the lac permease was expressed from the single chromosome copy (Fig. 1A) or from multiple copies of the gene (Fig. 1B). When the transport assay was performed directly in growth medium to eliminate any perturbations resulting from cell isolation as a variable, the results were the same. The Vmax for apparent active transport in whole cells was 4 ± 0.5 nmol/min mg of protein for the strain lacking PE (Fig. 1D) while the same strain carrying plasmid pDD72 and containing PE had a Vmax of 40 ± 5 nmol/min mg of protein (Fig. 1C); the Km (0.8 ± 0.3 mM) for transport was the same for both strains although the steady-state level of uptake by PE-deficient cells was significantly reduced (Fig. 1B), consistent with the lack of significant accumulation of substrate against a concentration gradient. Apparent active transport was also measured using entry of the natural substrate lactose into cells lacking a functional β-galactosidase. Again cells lacking PE were not able to rapidly take up lactose to high levels when compared to cells containing PE (Fig. 2A). The Vmax for lactose uptake (PE-deficient versus PE-containing cells, respectively) was reduced 6-fold (2.1 ± 0.13 versus 12 ± 0.7 nmol/min mg of protein) for cells expressing the lac permease from a single copy of the gene (Fig. 2B), and 5-fold (40 ± 5 versus 200 ± 30 nmol/min mg of protein) for cells carrying plasmid pT7-5/lacY (data not shown); the Km (0.5 ± 0.06 mM) was the same for all strains.Figure 2:Uptake of lactose by PE-containing and PE-deficient cells in a lacZ background. A, strain AD932 (lacZ) harboring either both plasmids pDD72 and pT7-5/lacY (□, pss + ) or plasmid pT7-5/lacY alone (○, pss) was assayed for its ability to take up lactose (0.4 mM) as a function of time as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, strain AD932 either with (□, pss + ) or without (○, pss) plasmid pDD72 was assayed for its ability to take up lactose as a function of lactose concentration and displayed as in Fig. 1, C and D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Maintenance of membrane impermeability to lac permease substrates was verified by measuring ONPG hydrolysis by whole cells. Cells of strain AD93 (lacY + lacZ + ) with and without plasmid pDD72 showed similar high rates of ONPG hydrolysis by internal β-galactosidase. However, cells of strain AD931 (lacY lacZ + ) showed the same low rate of ONPG hydrolysis either with or without plasmid pDD72, thus ruling out an increase in membrane permeability resulting in exit of substrate through passive diffusion as an explanation of the low rate of active transport and low level of accumulation by PE-deficient cells. The addition of the uncoupler FCCP had no effect on either the low rate of uptake or the level of accumulation of TMG by PE-deficient cells and was on the order of the residual FCCP-independent uptake by PE-containing cells (Fig. 3); the level of uptake observed in the presence of FCCP was significant over the control level in uninduced cells. In PE-containing cells FCCP reduced the Vmax for TMG uptake to 8 nmol/min mg of protein (versus 40 nmol/min mg of protein, Fig. 1C) with no effect on Km while neither Vmax nor Km were affected by FCCP in PE-deficient cells (data not shown). Similarly, the kinetics of lactose uptake in PE-deficient lacZ cells was little affected by FCCP (data not shown) which reduced the Vmax from 2.1 ± 0.13 to 0.83 ± 0.06 nmol/min mg of protein with no change in Km (0.5 ± 0.1 mM). The steady-state level of lactose accumulation in PE-deficient cells was also unaffected by FCCP (Fig. 4) but was drastically reduced in PE-containing cells; cells carrying a plasmid borne copy of lacY + gene were used to rapidly reach a steady-state level of accumulation. Unlike the measurement of TMG kinetic parameters in the presence of FCCP, a quantitative determination of these parameters for lactose uptake in FCCP-treated PE-containing cells (lac Z) was not possible in the 0.1-2 mM range probably consistent with the high Km (>10 mM) characteristic of facilitated diffusion in wild type de-energized cells(22Ghazi A. Schechter E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 645: 305-315Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Kaczorowski G.J. Robertson D.E. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3697-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); no similar data is available on the effect of de-energization on the Km for TMG uptake, but our data indicates there is no effect on Km. De-energization of both strains by FCCP under the above conditions was confirmed by measurement of the chemical gradient of protons across the membrane with the weak acid DMO at pH 5.5 and 150 mM potassium ion(30Padan E. Zilberstein D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).Figure 4:Effect of FCCP on lactose uptake by PE-containing and PE-deficient cells in a lacZ background.

https://openalex.org/W1986560775,"Heart mitochondria contain a nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport that participates in the regulation of matrix [Ca 2+ ]. Based largely on a single study (Brand, M. D.(1985) Biochem. J. 229, 161-166), there has been a consensus that this antiport promotes the electroneutral exchange of two Na + for one Ca 2+ . However, a recent study in our laboratory (Baysal, K., Jung, D. W., Gunter, K. K., Gunter, T. P., and Brierley, G. P. (1994) Am. J. Physiol. 266, C800-C808) has shown that the Na + -dependent efflux of Ca 2+ from heart mitochondria has more energy available to it than can be supplied by a passive 2Na + /Ca 2+ exchange. We have therefore re-examined Brand's protocols using fluorescent probes to monitor matrix pH and free [Ca 2+ ]. Respiring heart mitochondria, suspended in KCl and treated with ruthenium red to block Ca 2+ influx, extrude Ca 2+ and establish a large [Ca 2+ ]out : [Ca 2+ ]matrix gradient. The extrusion of Ca 2+ under these conditions is Na + -dependent and diltiazem-sensitive and can be attributed to the nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport. Addition of nigericin increases the membrane potential (Δ Ψ ) and decreases ΔpH to 0.1 or less, but has virtually no effect on the magnitude of the [Ca 2+ ] gradient. Under these conditions a gradient maintained by electroneutral 2Na + /Ca 2+ antiport should be abolished because the mitochondrial Na + /H + antiport keeps the [Na + ] gradient equivalent to the [H + ] gradient. The [Ca 2+ ] gradient is abolished, however, when an uncoupler is added to dissipate Δ Ψ or when the exogenous electroneutral antiport BrA23187 is added. In addition, [Ca 2+ ] influx via the nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport in nonrespiring mitochondria is enhanced when Δ Ψ is abolished. These results are consistent with Ca 2+ extrusion by an electrophoretic antiport that can respond to Δ Ψ but not with an electroneutral antiport.

These results are consistent with Ca 2+ extrusion by an electrophoretic antiport that can respond to Δ Ψ but not with an electroneutral antiport. INTRODUCTIONIt is now generally accepted that [Ca 2+ ] enters the matrix of heart mitochondria via the ruthenium red-sensitive uniport and is extruded on a nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport (see (1Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (2Crompton M. Bronner F. Intracellular Ca Regulation. R. Liss, New York1990: 181-209Google Scholar) for reviews). Until recently there has been a consensus that this antiport promotes the electroneutral exchange of two Na + for one Ca 2+ (2Crompton M. Bronner F. Intracellular Ca Regulation. R. Liss, New York1990: 181-209Google Scholar, 3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Li W. Shariat-Madar Z. Powers M. Sun X. Lane R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17983-17989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is based largely on a study by Brand (3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that showed a [Ca 2+ ] distribution established by the endogenous antiport did not differ significantly from that produced by the ionophore A23187. Because A23187 mediates electroneutral 2H + /Ca 2+ exchange and the endogenous Na + /H + antiport equilibrates [H + ] and [Na + ] gradients, it was concluded that the nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport must be electroneutral(3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This stoichiometry is also supported by the more recent report of Li et al.(4Li W. Shariat-Madar Z. Powers M. Sun X. Lane R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17983-17989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that all modes of transport promoted by a purified and reconstituted Na + /Ca 2+ antiport are insensitive to uncouplers and therefore electroneutral. However, there have also been indications that this antiport could be electrophoretic. The early report of Crompton et al.(5Crompton M. Kunzi M. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 79: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) established that the Na + -dependent efflux of Ca 2+ was dependent on the energy state of the mitochondria and kinetic data indicate the presence of three independent Na + binding sites on the antiport(6Hayat L.H. Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results could be explained by a contribution of the membrane potential, Δ Ψ , to an electrophoretic exchange, such as that found with the 3Na + /Ca 2+ antiport of the sarcolemma(7Pitts B.J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6232-6235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Two recent studies from our laboratory strongly suggest that the concept of an electroneutral nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport should be re-examined. In the first it was noted that the exchanger is regulated by matrix pH and that high rates of Na + /Ca 2+ antiport can be sustained when ΔpH (and hence the Na + gradient) approaches zero(8Baysal K. Brierley G.P. Novgorodov S. Jung D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This led us to a null-point study in which it was established that [Ca 2+ ] gradients maintained by Na + /Ca 2+ antiport are too large to be sustained by a passive electroneutral exchange of 2Na + for one Ca 2+ (9Baysal K. Jung D.W. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C800-C808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations in turn led us to the present work in which we examine the protocols of Brand (3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in more detail using currently available fluorescent probes to monitor [H + ] and [Ca 2+ ] gradients. In contrast to Brand(3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we conclude that, when the pH gradient of respiring mitochondria is collapsed by addition of nigericin, a large [Ca 2+ ]out :[Ca 2+ ]matrix gradient is maintained. Addition of an uncoupler to dissipate Δ Ψ abolishes this gradient, as does addition of the electroneutral exchanger BrA23187. These experiments lead to the conclusion that the nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport is not electroneutral under these conditions and that there is a large contribution of Δ Ψ to the observed [Ca 2+ ] gradient. Experiments showing Na + -dependent [Ca 2+ ] influx in nonrespiring mitochondria also support the conclusion that the mitochondrial nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport is electrophoretic.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEquilibration of Mitochondria with Fluorescent ProbesBeef heart mitochondria were prepared as described previously (10Brierley G.P.

Chem. 1984; 259: 14672-14678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suspended at 25 mg/ml in sucrose (0.25 M), containing TES 1The abbreviations used are as follows: TES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidBCECF2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceinAMacetoxymethyl estercSNARF-1™a pH indicator marketed by Molecular Probes Inc.pHextramitochondrial pHpHmatrix pHΔ Ψmembrane potentialTPP+tetraphenylphosphonium ionNTAnitrilotriacetic acidFCCPcarbonyl cyanide-4-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazoneTMA+tetramethylammonium ion. (10 mM, K + salt, pH 7.4). Mitochondria were equilibrated with fluorescent probes as follows. Mitochondria (12.5 mg/ml) were incubated at 24°C in a medium of sucrose (0.25 M), TES (10 mM), NaCl (20 mM), ATP (1.6 mM), EGTA (0.2 mM) neutralized to pH 7.4 with KOH and containing either BCECF/AM (7.2 μM), cSNARF-1/AM (8.8 μM), SBFI/AM (11.1 μM), or fura-2/AM (5 μM). Pluronic F-127 was also added when SBFI/AM was used(14Jung D.W. Apel L.M. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1047-C1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second suspension of mitochondria, incubated in the same medium without the fluorescent probe, was used to determine autofluorescence. After 20 min, 3 volumes of ice-cold wash medium (0.2 M sucrose, 10 mM K + TES, 30 μM EGTA, pH 7.4) were added, and the mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation and resuspended in the same medium. After an additional 5-min incubation at 24°C, the mitochondria were again diluted, reisolated by centrifugation, and suspended at 25 mg/ml in the wash medium. These loading conditions deplete the mitochondria of almost all endogenous Ca 2+ . Virtually none of the fura-2 is outside the matrix since addition of near saturating concentrations of [Ca 2+ ] to suspended mitochondria results in an insignificant increase in fura-2 fluorescence. ADP-stimulated respiration and respiratory control ratios of probe-loaded mitochondria are ~ 90% of control mitochondria(17Jung D.W. Davis M.H. Brierley G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Incubation ConditionsFor most experiments, the mitochondria containing sequestered fluorescent probes were incubated at 0.5 mg/ml in a 3-ml cuvette at 25°C in a standard medium consisting of: KCl (100 mM), HEPES (15 mM, K + salt, pH 7.35), cyclosporin A (1 μM), rotenone (1 μg/ml), and oligomycin (2 μg/ml). The EGTA carried over with the addition of mitochondria was 0.6 μM. Further additions were made as described in the legends. The experiments shown in Fig. 3 were carried out in the mannitol-sucrose medium described by Brand(3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). [Ca 2+ ] buffers were prepared by the addition of 2 mM EGTA (for 0-2 μM [Ca 2+ ] buffers) or 2 mM NTA (5-50 μM [Ca 2+ ] buffers) and variable amounts of CaCl2 to the standard medium. The free [Ca 2+ ] for each buffer was calculated using the Fabiato computer program (11Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) using apparent stability constants for 25°C and pH 7.4 of 1.146 × 104 for Ca/NTA, 1.592 × 107 for Ca/EGTA, and 15.75 for Ca/succinate. The absolute log K1 for Ca/NTA was taken as 6.45 with log protonation constants of 9.71, 2.49, 1.86, and 0.8(12Anderegg G. Pure Appl. Chem. 1982; 54: 2693-2758Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The pHo was measured with a glass electrode.Fluorescence MeasurementsFluorescence was measured using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B fluorimeter interfaced with a computer as described previously(9Baysal K. Jung D.W. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C800-C808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jung D.W. Apel L.M. Brierley G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The monochromators were driven to obtain ratios approximately every 7 s for a single probe (13Jung D.W. Apel L.M. Brierley G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Jung D.W. Apel L.M. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1047-C1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or every 30 s when two probes were used(9Baysal K. Jung D.W. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C800-C808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BCECF fluorescence was recorded at 550 nm with excitation at 509 and 450 nm, fura-2 fluorescence at 510 nm with excitation at 340 and 365 nm, SBFI fluorescence at 510 nm with excitation at 350 and 390 nm excitation, and cSNARF-1 emission at 630 and 604 nm with excitation at 534 nm. For each experiment the exact protocol was repeated using nonloaded mitochondria to record autofluorescence. The records of autofluorescence were subtracted from the experimental records before [Ca 2+ ], [Na + ], and pHi were calculated using the ratioing procedure(8Baysal K. Brierley G.P. Novgorodov S. Jung D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Baysal K. Jung D.W. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Brierley G.P. Am. J.

Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1047-C1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Matrix [Ca 2+ ] was calculated after determining Rmin, Rmax, and Sf2 /Sb2 values using the following expression(15Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]=Kd(R-Rmin)/(Rmax-R)Sf2/Sb2(Eq. 1) To determine Rmin, BrA23187 (2 μM) was added to respiring mitochondria suspended in the standard medium containing 2 mM EGTA to deplete mitochondrial Ca 2+ , leaving only uncomplexed fura-2 in the matrix (Fig. 1). Rmax was obtained by allowing respiring mitochondria to accumulate Ca 2+ and saturate matrix fura-2 (Fig. 1). Sf2 /Sb2 is the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 365 nm with zero and with excess Ca 2+ . Rmin, Rmax, and Sf2 /Sb2 values were determined for each mitochondrial preparation. The means ± S.E. for the experiments presented here (n = 6) were 0.626 ± 0.001 Rmin, 2.653 ± 0.113 Rmax, and 1.858 ± 0.242 Sf2 /Sb2 . The solid line in Fig. 1 represents the relationship between calculated [Ca 2+ ] and the 340/365 ratio and shows that fura-2 approaches saturation above 2 μM matrix [Ca 2+ ]. With this in mind our experiments were designed to keep matrix [Ca 2+ ] below 2 μM.Figure 1:Estimation of Rmin and Rmax for fura-2 sequestered in the matrix of heart mitochondria. Mitochondria were loaded with fura-2 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and added to the standard medium containing 2 mM EGTA for the Rmin determination and 15 μM EGTA for the Rmax determination. Succinate (5 mM) was added at 100 s. CaCl2 (2 mM) was added at 200 s for the Rmax determination and BrA23187 (2 μM) for the Rmin determination. Fluorescence was corrected for autofluorescence and ratios (340/365)ex were calculated from net fluorescence intensities. The relative net fluorescence intensities and calculated ratios were: Rmin (340/530) = 0.64, Rmax (760/254) = 3.0, and Sf2 /Sb2 (530/254) = 2.09. The solid line shows the relationship between the ratios and [Ca 2+ ] calculated according to. The initial ratio value of 1.55 indicates a matrix [Ca 2+ ] of 0.25 μM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Estimation of Δ Ψ Membrane potential (Δ Ψ ) was estimated using [3H]TPP + distribution calibrated with 86 Rb + (16Jensen B.D. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Succinate respiration was inhibited with malonate to vary Δ Ψ (16Jensen B.D. Gunter K.K. Gunter T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 305-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial volumes and water spaces were determined using [14C]sucrose and [3H]H2O as described previously(17Jung D.W. Davis M.H. Brierley G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Following the recent suggested convention (18Silverstein T.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 1-3Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Δ Ψ and ΔpH are calculated as the difference between the matrix and medium values. This means that Δ Ψ is negative and ΔpH is positive in normal respiring mitochondria. The reader should be aware that this convention was not used by Brand (3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or in many of the other references cited.All chemicals used were of reagent grade purity or higher. Ruthenium red was obtained from Fluka and recrystallized according to Luft(19Luft J.H. Anat. Rec. 1971; 171: 347-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). The AM esters were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) and were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (silylation grade) obtained from Pierce.RESULTSA passive nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport will exchange Ca 2+ for Na + until the energy contained in the electrochemical gradient of Ca 2+ is balanced by the proper stoichiometric factor (n) multiplied by the energy in the electrochemical gradient of Na + (20Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Gunter K.K. Zuscik M.J. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21640-21648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Crompton M. Curr. Top. Membr. Transp. 1985; 25: 231-276Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because Na + /H + exchange is rapid in isolated mitochondria and effectively equilibrates the [Na + ] and [H + ] gradients, the following expression should hold for a passive nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport at equilibrium. Δμ~Ca2+=nΔμ~Na+=nΔμ~H+(Eq. 2) At 25°C this relationship can be expressed as follows(20Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Gunter K.K. Zuscik M.J. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21640-21648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [Ca2+]out/[Ca2+]matrix=10((2-n)Ψ/59+nΔpH)(Eq. 3) This thermodynamic relationship predicts that when ΔpH is collapsed, no [Ca 2+ ] gradient can be maintained at equilibrium if the antiport is electroneutral (n = 2), since 10 2ΔpH = 1 under these conditions. However, a [Ca 2+ ] gradient can be maintained if the antiport promotes electrophoretic exchange (n > 2) and responds to Δ Ψ . The term “electrophoretic” is used to indicate that the transport occurs in response to an existing electrical potential. This is in contrast to a transport reaction that generates a potential that would be termed “electrogenic”(23Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 2. Academic Press, London1992: 27Google Scholar).The assumption that ΔpH and ΔpNa are very near equivalent is essential to this investigation and is supported by several studies. Crompton and Heid (24Crompton M. Heid I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) using isotope distribution procedures showed that the [Na + ] and [H + ] gradients are nearly at equilibrium for nonrespiring rat heart mitochondria suspended in a KCl medium. This equilibrium results from the high rate of Na + /H + exchange relative to the Na + /Ca 2+ antiport(24Crompton M. Heid I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Studies from this laboratory (14Jung D.W. Apel L.M. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1047-C1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using SBFI-equilibrated pig heart mitochondria strongly support this conclusion. When the [Na + ] gradients reported (14Jung D.W. Apel L.M. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1047-C1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are compared with the appropriate [H + ] gradients measured in related studies using the fluorescent probes BCECF (25Brierley G.P. Davis M.H. Jung D.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4347-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or cSNARF-1(8Baysal K. Brierley G.P. Novgorodov S. Jung D.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the mean difference between ΔpH and ΔpNa calculates to 0.11 ± 0.06 (n = 12).Isolated beef heart mitochondria are difficult to load with SBFI (or the analogous probe Sodium Green). The fluorescence signal obtained with these preparations is no greater than 1.5 times the autofluorescence. This makes it very difficult to distinguish between changes in redox components and changes in matrix [Na + ] and has prevented us from following the [Na + ] gradient directly in the respiring beef heart mitochondria used in these studies. However, we were able to follow the spontaneous decay of the pH and pNa gradients in nonrespiring beef heart mitochondria that had been equilibrated with SBFI and cSNARF-1 (Fig. 2). In this protocol the decay of ΔpNa approximates the ΔpH decay with a maximum difference of 0.17. These results support the concept that ΔpH and ΔpNa are maintained nearly equal by the Na + /H + antiport (14Jung D.W. Apel L.M. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1047-C1055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Crompton M. Heid I. Eur. J.

Mitochondria equilibrated with both SBFI and cSNARF-1 were added to the standard medium containing ruthenium red (1 μM), NaCl (19 mM), EGTA (1 mM), and CaCl2 (0.9 mM). Net fluorescence intensities were used to calculate matrix pH (8Baysal K. Brierley G.P. Novgorodov S. Jung D.W. Arch. Biochem.

Medium pH was 7.37.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In his influential 1985 study of the stoichiometry of this antiport, Brand (3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) used a Ca 2+ -electrode to follow medium [Ca 2+ ] in a suspension of rat heart mitochondria respiring in a low K + medium. After addition of nigericin he found the matrix to be acid with a ΔpH of about −1.0. Under these conditions he calculated that external [Ca 2+ ] for an n = 2 stoichiometry should differ from that for n = 3 by 0.634 μM at equilibrium(3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At equilibrium Brand (3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reported a ΔpH of −0.99 (using the conventions of (18Silverstein T.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 1-3Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar)), a ΔpNa of −0.86, Δ Ψ of −161 mV, external [Ca 2+ ] of 6.37 μM, and a calculated matrix [Ca 2+ ] of nearly 500 μM for mitochondria containing approximately 3 nmol of Ca 2+ /mg of protein.These values are out of line with our experience with respiring beef heart mitochondria under quite similar conditions. Using BCECF fluorescence to monitor pHi we see a large negative ΔpH (interior acid) only for nonrespiring mitochondria following nigericin addition in the low K + medium used by Brand (Fig. 3). Under these conditions a ΔpH of about −0.8 is established immediately and decays to about −0.5 after 500 s (Fig. 3). Mitochondria respiring with succinate in the same medium show a transient ΔpH of about −0.5 following nigericin addition, but respiration rapidly establishes a condition in which ΔpH is about 0.15 (Fig. 3). This is probably the result of electrophoretic uptake of TMA + in response to the high Δ Ψ established by nigericin. Addition of succinate to nonrespiring mitochondria maintaining a large negative ΔpH results in an alkaline shift to a final ΔpH near 0.1 (Fig. 3). In the KCl medium used for the studies reported here there is no discernible ΔpH after nigericin addition whether or not respiration is taking place because nigericin equilibrates the [H + ] gradient with the [K + ] gradient(23Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 2. Academic Press, London1992: 27Google Scholar). The BCECF-loaded mitochondria lose some endogenous K + during equilibration with the probe and average just over 100 ng ion K + •mg -1 protein. The incubation medium contains about 120 mM K + , so the [K + ] gradient is minimal under these conditions.These results suggest that Brand's estimate of ΔpH for respiring mitochondria treated with nigericin (3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) is too large. The distribution of [14C]methylamine and 22 Na + was used to estimate the gradients in his study (3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and it is possible that either redistribution of the probe at anaerobiosis (following centrifugation), nonohmic uptake of the cationic probes, or changes in probe binding during energization in the low ionic strength suspending medium could have affected the results (see (26Jung D.W. Davis M.H. Brierley G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 263: 1928Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). At pH 7 methylamine (pKa ~ 10.5) is >99% cationic. Regardless of the reason for the discrepancy, a decrease in the ΔpNa from −0.86 as estimated by Brand (3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to −0.50 or less would result in loss of ability to distinguish between n = 2 and n = 3 stoichiometry in his experiment. As shown in Fig. 4 the difference in external [Ca 2+ ] predicted for these two cases becomes less than 0.1 μM at −0.5 ΔpNa. If ΔpH (and therefore ΔpNa) were as small as the experiments of Fig. 3 indicate, the difference between n = 2 and n = 3 would disappear completely (Fig. 4). If in fact the ΔpH in Brand's experiment (3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was much less than his estimate, then he would have seen no measurable change in external [Ca 2+ ] when A23187 was added to provide an exogenous electroneutral exchanger, even if the endogenous antiport were electrophoretic.Figure 4:Predicted values for extramitochondria [Ca 2+ ] versus the Na + gradient as a function of the stoichiometry of the nNa + /Ca 2+ antiport.

J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a stoichiometry of either 2 or 3 Na + /Ca 2+ , and various values of ΔpNa. Due to uncertainties in some of the values these calculations vary slightly when compared with those of Brand(3Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 229: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For example, our value for n = 2 and ΔpNa of −0.86 is 6.66 μM as opposed to 6.53 given in(3Brand M.D. Biochem.

Ras is a small guanine nucleotide-binding GTPase that transduces biological information from the cell surface to the nucleus(1Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (3767) Google Scholar). Its ability to transfer growth signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade puts it in the heart of signaling pathways that cause proliferation in normal cells and uncontrolled growth in cancer cells(2McCormick F.

Indeed, mutations that lock Ras in its active, GTP-bound state lead to malignant transformation and are among the most frequently identified mutations in human cancers (1Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (3767) Google Scholar). For example, 50% of colorectal and 95% of pancreatic human cancers have activated ras oncogenes. Over the last decade several strategies have been investigated, with little success, to disrupt Ras function and, hence, to inhibit the growth of tumors with activated ras oncogenes. The search has recently intensified with the discovery that Ras requires lipid modification with a farnesyl group for localization to the plasma membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in growth signaling(3Willumsen B.M.

To avoid inherent problems of peptides, our strategy has been to design non-peptide CAAX mimetics. Working toward this goal, we initially made potent inhibitors of FTase where “VI” in CVIM, the carboxyl terminus of KB-Ras, was replaced by 4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) derivatives that served as hydrophobic spacers to link Cys to Met (i.e. Cys-4ABA-Met)(26Nigam M.

A critical and as yet unreported goal in this area has been to construct non-peptidic inhibitors with no amide bonds in their molecular backbone. Our approach to improving the in vivo potency and hydrolytic stability of our inhibitors involved extending the hydrophobic spacer strategy to include the terminal methionine as well as the central aliphatic residues of CVIM. Here we report the design, synthesis, and selective inhibition of FTase in vitro and in vivo by the first non-peptide CAAX mimetic where 4-amino-3′-carboxybiphenyl was designed as a VIM tripeptide mimetic. The peptidomimetic 2 (Fig. 1) was synthesized as described previously(27Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Saleem M. Seong C.-M. Wathen S.P. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol.

The peptidomimetics 4a, 4b, and 4c were prepared from the corresponding 4-aminobiphenyl (prepared from Suzuki coupling (30Watanabe T. Miyaura N. Suzuki A. Syn.

All compounds were more than 98% pure as determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and their spectroscopic data were consistent with the assigned structures.

However, these peptidomimetics still retain several amide bonds and other peptide features and are thus vulnerable to proteolytic degradation inside cells. A desirable goal in using these molecules as therapeutic agents is to eliminate these features and, hence, make true non-peptide CAAX mimetics. Initially, we designed a family of mimetics of tetrapeptide CVIM 1 (from KB-Ras) where VI was replaced by aminobenzoic acid (ABA) derivatives(26Nigam M. Seong C.-M. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20695-20698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Saleem M. Seong C.-M. Wathen S.P. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol.

Lett. 1994; 4: 2579-2584Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cys-4ABA-Met 2 is a CVIM peptidomimetic (Fig. 1) that potently inhibits FTase (IC50 = 50-200 nM). Although this peptidomimetic lacks one peptide bond and is made of 2 instead of 4 amino acids, it still retains several peptide features. We have therefore extended our hydrophobic spacer strategy and have designed a 4-amino-3′-carboxybiphenyl derivative as a “VIM” tripeptide mimic with restricted conformational flexibility. Attachment of this group to cysteinal via reductive amination leads to (R)-4-[N-(3-mercapto-2-aminopropyl)]amino-3′-carboxybiphenyl 4a (Fig. 1). This derivative contains no amide bonds and thus is a true non-peptide mimetic of the CAAX tetrapeptide. Although 4a and its parent compounds 1, 2, and 3 are structurally quite distinct, they share several features that are key to FTase recognition. They all have free cysteine thiol, terminal amine, and carboxylate groups that are separated by a hydrophobic moiety. Furthermore, molecular modeling studies gave energy-minimized structures that show similar distances between the cysteine thiol and the free carboxylate in both 4a and CVIM in its extended conformation (Fig. 2). We have also made several analogues of 4a to further probe the FTase binding site. Among these, analogue 4b (Fig. 1) contains the free carboxylate in the 4′- rather than the 3′-position of the biphenyl. In peptidomimetic 4b the separation between the cysteine thiol and carboxylate no longer corresponds to that of CVIM. Another analogue with a methyl group in the 3′ position (4c) was also synthesized to determine whether a negatively charged carboxylate at the 3′ position is critical to FTase inhibition. Cys-4ABA-Met 2 (1-10 μM) inhibited FTase in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 150 nM (Table 1). This value is similar to our previously reported IC50 values (26Nigam M. Seong C.-M. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20695-20698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Saleem M. Seong C.-M. Wathen S.P. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12410-12413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of the amide bond between cysteine and aminobenzoic acid resulted in reduced Cys-4ABA-Met 3 which had an IC50 of 300 nM. Replacing the methionine and the COOH-terminal amide bond in 3 by another aromatic ring to obtain the biphenyl-based peptidomimetic 4a (Fig. 1) improved potency (Table 1). Peptidomimetic 4a had an IC50 of 150 nM toward partially purified FTase from human Burkitt lymphoma cells and 50 nM toward rat brain FTase purified to homogeneity (a gift from Dr. Patrick Casey, Duke University). Thus, despite major structural differences between the parent compound CVIM 1 and 4a, the second generation CAAX peptidomimetic 4a retained the potent FTase inhibitory activity of its parent tetrapeptide CVIM 1 and the first generation CAAX peptide mimetics 2 and 3 (Table 1). The position of the free carboxylate group is critical to FTase inhibition since placing this group at the 4′- position as in 4b (Fig. 1) dramatically decreases its affinity toward FTase (Fig. 3A, Table 1). Peptidomimetic 4b (IC50 = 6650 nM) is 45-fold less potent than its isomer 4a. This strongly suggests that within the active site of FTase, there must be a positively charged residue such as Lys to interact with the negative charge of the free carboxylate. Interestingly, however, replacing the 3′-carboxylate with a methyl group as in 4c decreased potency by only 5-fold (IC50 = 765 nM). This shows that the FTase binding site prefers a neutral group at the 3′-position to a negative charge at the 4′-position, suggesting either steric hindrance or repulsive interactions from the microenvironment surrounding the 4′-region of the biphenyl.Tabled 1Figure 3:FTase and GGTase I inhibition studies. Partially purified FTase and GGTase I were incubated with Ras CAAX peptidomimetics and their ability to transfer [3H]farnesyl to Ha-Ras-CVLS (FTase) and [3H]geranylgeranyl to Ha-Ras-CVLL (GGTase I) was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, FTase inhibition by: 4a (□) and 4b ( ▪ ); B, FTase (□) and GGTase I ( ▪ ) inhibition by 4a.

Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12586-12590Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) suggested that potent inhibitory activity toward FTase might require inhibitors to take up a β turn conformation bringing the cysteine thiol and free carboxylate in close proximity to form a bidentate complex with Zn 2+ . Recently, we have provided evidence that argues against this model(27Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Saleem M. Seong C.-M. Wathen S.P. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12410-12413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the biphenyl-based non-peptide CAAX mimetic described here cannot take up this structure (Fig. 2), leading us to conclude that potent inhibition of FTase does not require a β turn conformation. Besides having poor cellular uptake and being rapidly degraded, a third disadvantage of natural CAAX peptides is that they are farnesylated by FTase. This results in metabolic inactivation since farnesylated CAAX derivatives are no longer inhibitors of FTase(26Nigam M. Seong C.-M. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20695-20698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that the natural peptide CVLS (carboxyl-terminal CAAX of Ha-Ras) is farnesylated by FTase from Burkitt lymphoma cells. Replacing the tripeptide VLS with 4-amino-3′-carboxybiphenyl, as in 4a, did not affect potency toward FTase inhibition (Table 1) but prevented farnesylation of the cysteine thiol (Fig. 4). None of our peptidomimetics are metabolically inactivated by FTase (Fig. 4). Geranylgeranylation is a more common protein prenylation than farnesylation(15Casey P. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1731-1740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore critical to design CAAX peptidomimetics with high selectivity toward inhibiting FTase to minimize side effects. In the parent CAAX tetrapeptides, the X position determines whether the cysteine thiol will be farnesylated by FTase or geranylgeranylated by GGTase I. Those proteins or peptides with Leu or Ile at the X position are geranylgeranylated. The peptidomimetics described here no longer contain amino acids that would dictate this selectivity, and therefore it is important to evaluate their ability to inhibit GGTase I prior to further development. Fig. 3B shows that our most potent FTase inhibitor is a very poor GGTase I inhibitor. The ability of 4a to inhibit the transfer of geranylgeranyl to Ras-CVLL (IC50 = 100,000 nM) was 666-fold less than that of 4a to inhibit the transfer of farnesyl to Ras-CVLS (IC50 = 150 nM) (Table 1). This selectivity was much more pronounced than in the first generation peptidomimetics 2 and 3, which were more selective for FTase relative to GGTase I by only 10 and 15-fold, respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, the free carboxylate is not responsible for this selectivity since replacement of this group by a methyl (4c) did not increase affinity toward GGTase I (Table 1). These results suggest that FTase and GGTase I binding sites are quite different and that differences among Leu, Ile, and Met side chains cannot be the only predictors of selectivity. A key factor that will determine further development of these molecules as anticancer drugs is whether they inhibit Ras processing in whole cells and whether the selectivity toward FTase is retained in vivo. To determine the efficiency of our CAAX peptidomimetics to disrupt Ras processing, we treated ras oncogene-transformed cells with these inhibitors, immunoprecipitated processed (P) and unprocessed (U) Ras proteins from lysates, separated them by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Ras antibody that recognizes both forms of Ras. Farnesylated Ras runs faster than unprocessed Ras on SDS-PAGE(23Kohl N.E. Mosser S.D. deSolms S.J. Guiliani E.A. Pompliano D.L. Graham S.L. Smith R.L. Scolnick E.M. Oliff A. Gibbs J.B.

Fig. 5A (lane1) shows that cells treated with vehicle contain only processed Ras, whereas cells treated with lovastatin (lane2) contained both processed and unprocessed Ras, indicating that lovastatin inhibited Ras processing. Lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that inhibits the biosynthesis of farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, is used routinely as a positive control for inhibition of processing of both geranylgeranylated and farnesylated proteins(23Kohl N.E.

In contrast, the corresponding methyl ester of 3 (200 μM) inhibited FTase (Fig. 5A, lane3). This is consistent with previous work showing that neutralization of the carboxylate of CAAX peptides enhances their ability to inhibit Ras processing(23Kohl N.E. Mosser S.D. deSolms S.J.

This prodrug strategy relies on cellular esterases to activate the peptidomimetics. Although peptidomimetic 4a has a free carboxylate negative charge, it was able to enter cells and potently inhibit Ras processing (lane 4, 100 μM4a). Peptidomimetic 4a inhibited Ras processing with concentrations as low as 50 μM (lane 5), whereas its corresponding parent compound 3 did not inhibit Ras processing at concentrations as high as 200 μM (data not shown). Peptidomimetic 4a was as potent as the methylester of its parent compound 3 (Fig. 5A, lane3). Furthermore, 4a is the first CAAX peptidomimeticthat effectively inhibits Ras processing in whole cells directly without relying on cellular enzymes for activation. The hydrophobic character of the biphenyl group may compensate for the free carboxylate negative charge hence allowing the peptidomimetic to penetrate membranes and promoting its cellular uptake. Peptidomimetics 4b and 4c were not able to inhibit Ras processing (Fig. 5A, lanes7 and 8). We then investigated the selectivity of our Ras farnesylation inhibitors by determining their ability to inhibit processing of Rap1A, a small G-protein that is geranylgeranylated(15Casey P. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1731-1740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with lovastatin or peptidomimetics exactly as described for Ras processing experiments. Lysates were then separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Rap1A antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Control cells contained only the geranylgeranylated Rap 1A (Fig. 5B, lane1), whereas lovastatin-treated cells contained both processed and unprocessed forms of Rap 1A, indicating, as expected, that lovastatin inhibited the processing of Rap 1A (Fig. 5B, lane2). Peptidomimetic 4a, which inhibited Ras processing, was not able to inhibit Rap 1A geranylgeranylation (Fig. 5B, lanes4-6). Peptidomimetics 4b and 4c did not inhibit Rap 1A processing (Fig. 5B, lanes7 and 8). Thus, we have designed the first non-peptide CAAX mimetic that contains no hydrolyzable groups and lacks other peptidic features. Although we have made major structural alterations in the parent CAAX tetrapeptide, the peptidomimetic retained high potency toward inhibiting FTase. Structure activity relationship studies further revealed that the crucial structural features for FTase recognition and potent inhibition are free thiol and carboxylate groups maintained at a critical distance and orientation by a hydrophobic spacer. Furthermore, these true CAAX peptidomimetics have several desirable features as potential therapeutic agents. They are selective inhibitors for farnesylation relative to geranylgeranylation both in vitro and in vivo, they do not require a prodrug strategy for whole cell activity, and they are not metabolically inactivated by FTase. We are presently evaluating their selectivity toward antagonizing oncogenic Ras signaling and their efficacy as anticancer agents against tumors with activated ras oncogenes."

EGF receptor•AP-2 complexes were isolated from 35 S-labeled cells treated with EGF by EGF receptor affinity chromatography followed by precipitation with the antibody to AP-2. Quantitation of the relative molar concentrations of the proteins found in the complex revealed that 1 mol of AP-2 was associated with approximately 1.1 mol of EGF receptor. No other proteins were present in significant molar concentrations relative to AP-2, indicating that other proteins are not stoichiometrically involved in the interaction of EGF receptors and AP-2 in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cells expressing a mutant EGF receptor demonstrated that the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal 214 residues of the EGF receptor are essential for interaction with AP-2.

Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Receptor down-regulation is due to the EGF-accelerated endocytosis and degradation of EGF receptors (reviewed in (2Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and (3Starbuck C. Lauffenburger D.A. Biotechnol. Prog. 1992; 8: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)). It has been proposed that occupied EGF receptors are internalized severalfold faster than unoccupied receptors (4Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol.

Morphological studies suggest that EGF increases receptor endocytosis by promoting receptor clustering into clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane which is followed by receptor internalization into clathrin-coated vesicles(6Haigler H.T. McKanna J.A. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 7Hanover J.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.

Cell. 1993; 4: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations together with similar analyses of other membrane receptors have lead to the view that plasma membrane-coated pits function as sorting organelles selectively recruiting receptors that contain internalization sequences or “codes” within their cytoplasmic domains (reviewed in Refs. 9 and 10). A main structural component of coated pits is the clathrin lattice anchored to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane by the associated protein complexes or adaptors (APs) (11, 12, reviewed in Refs. 9 and 13-15). AP-2 is the most ubiquitous of the associated proteins found in coated vesicles derived from the plasma membrane. It is a heterotetramer containing two large subunits, α and β2 (100-115 kDa), a medium subunit μ2 (50 kDa), and a small subunit σ 2 (17 kDa) (16, reviewed in Refs. 9, 15, 17). In addition, there are two isoforms of the α-subunit, αA and αC, encoded by distinct but highly homologous genes(19Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The large β2 subunit plus the medium and small subunits of AP-2 are very homologous to the corresponding subunits (β1, μ1, and σ 1) of the Golgi clathrin-associated protein complex, AP-1(20Kirchhausen T.

S. A. 1989; 86: 2612-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, in place of an α-subunit, AP-1 contains a γ -subunit ( ~ 100 kDa) that has a relatively low level of similarity to the α-subunit(24Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Studies of bovine brain-coated vesicles suggest that for AP-2 each α-subunit is paired with a β2-subunit, whereas for AP-1, γ -adaptin is complexed with a β1-subunit that migrates with slightly slow mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(19Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 25Ahle S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20089-20093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subunit and isoform composition of APs are poorly described in other cell types or cultured cell lines. The β subunits of AP-2 and AP-1 are known to bind clathrin(26Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); however, the function of other subunits is still unclear. Current data suggest that the interaction of AP-2 with the intracellular domain of transmembrane receptors mediates the selective recruitment of receptors into coated pits(27Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 28Glickman J.N. Conibear E. Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Beltzer J.P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12537-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of receptor•AP interaction and the universality of this association with different classes of receptors are not yet understood. Previously published data have shown that AP-2 co-immunoprecipitates with EGF receptors from cells treated with EGF(31Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This study, however, did not establish the molecular composition of EGF receptor•AP-2 complexes. Here, we determine the stoichiometry of components in this complex and assess whether AP-2 interacts directly with the EGF receptor using a double affinity purification protocol to analyze metabolically labeled EGF receptor•AP-2 complexes. EGF was purified from submaxillary glands as described previously(32Savage Jr., C.R. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7609-7611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and EGF-Affi-Gel 10 (3.5 mg/ml gel) was prepared according to Cohen et al.(33Cohen S. Carpenter G. King Jr., L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4834-4842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit 986 antibody to EGF receptor was described elsewhere (34Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while anti-EGF receptor rabbit serum 2913 (specific to intracellular domain) was kindly provided by Dr. L. Beguinot (S. H. Raffaele, Milano). Monoclonal antibody LA22 to the extracellular domain of human EGF receptor was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Monoclonal antibodies AC1-M11 and B1-M6 that recognize α- and β-subunits of APs(35Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), respectively, were a gift from Dr. M. S. Robinson (University of Cambridge). Polyclonal antibodies 31 (Ab31) to αC and 32 (Ab32) to β-subunits were developed by injecting rabbits with soluble recombinant proteins corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat αC- and β2-subunits, respectively. Their specificity was confirmed by Western blot analysis of APs purified from coated vesicles of bovine brain. Polyclonal antibodies were used as the IgG fraction purified from the serum using Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The full-length cDNAs of the large subunits αC and β2 of rat brain AP-2 previously characterized by us (23Kirchhausen T. Nathanson K.L. Matsui W. Vaisberg A. Chow E.P. Burne C. Keen J.H. Davis A.E.

These fragments include the linker and ear domains of the large subunits(16Matsui W. Kirchhausen T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Kirchhausen T. Nathanson K.L. Matsui W. Vaisberg A. Chow E.P. Burne C. Keen J.H. Davis A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2612-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction primers for αC were 5′-GG CAT ATG AGC ATC GAT GTG AAT GGG and 3′-CAT GGT GTG ACG TCT ATT CCT AGG GG and contained the unpaired bases for the NdeI cloning site (underlined) added to facilitate ligation into the NdeI cloning site of the bacterial expression vector pETa. The primers for β2 were 5′-TG GCT CAC TTG CCA ATT CAC CAT and 3′-CGA CTA TAA TCG TGA GTG; ligation of the polymerase chain reaction product into the blunt-ended Ndel restriction site of pET5a recreated this site upstream of the insertion. In order to facilitate the purification of the protein fragments (see below), a histidine tag containing the sequence Met-Ser-Ala-Gly-6 × His was added in-frame immediately upstream of the starting methionine by insertion of an appropriate oligonucleotide cassette into the Ndel site. Sequence of the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing(38Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar). These constructs place the AP-2 fragments at the translational start site driven by T7 RNA polymerase whose expression is under control of the inducible lacUV promoter(37Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 80-89Google Scholar). BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells were transformed with either one of the two expression vectors, and bacteria were grown at 37°C until the cell density reached A600 ≈ 0.5 in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg of ampicillin. Cultures were cooled to room temperature in an ice-water bath, and expression of the fragments was induced by addition of 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (JA-10, Beckman; 7000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C), and the pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed by sonication (XL2020, Sonicator; 80% power setting) until they became slightly brown (5 × 30-s sonication bursts with 30-60-s cooling intervals in ice water). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (JA17, 15,000 rpm, 30 min, 4°C), and the supernatants, supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol mixed with 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA agarose beads (Quiagen), prewashed with sonication buffer, by constant inversion (2-3 h, 4°C). The beads were collected by gravity flow over an open-ended column (2.5-cm diameter) and washed five times by resuspension in 10 ml of sonication buffer supplemented with 10 mM imidazole and 0.2% Triton X-100. The histidine-tagged αC and β2 proteins were eluted with five consecutive washes of 1 ml each (200 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). EDTA at 1 mM and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 0.25 mM were added to the pooled fractions, dialyzed overnight (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 4°C), and concentrated in a Centriprep-10 (Millipore) to 5-10 mg/ml. After clarification by centrifugation (TL 100.4, Beckman; 85,000 rpm, 30 min, 4°C), 0.5-ml aliquots were applied into a preparative Superdex 75 (Pharmacia) HR 16/50 sizing column (pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA and running at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature). At least 90% of the αC and β2 fragments were recovered as a monomeric species with a purity greater than 95% as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining of the appropriate fractions. Aliquots were kept at -20°C. Mouse NIH 3T3 cells expressing 4-8 × 105 human wild-type EGF receptors per cell, WT cells(34Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used in most experiments. The EGF receptor mutant Dc214 in which 214 amino acid residues have been deleted from the carboxyl terminus was described previously(34Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells expressing Dc214 displayed approximately 4.0-6.0 × 105 receptors per cell. Cells were grown in 100-250-mm dishes or trays (Costar) as described (34Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for experiments when confluent. Cells were starved in 0.5% serum overnight prior to each experiment. Cells treated or not treated with EGF were washed with Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ -free phosphate-buffered saline (CMF-PBS) and solubilized in TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 544 μM iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) by scraping the cells from the dish with a rubber policeman followed by gentle rotation for 10 min at 4°C. Lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Approximately 50-60% of total cellular AP-2 pool was found in the supernatants after centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with Ab31 or Ab32 for 3 h at 4°C and then 30-60 min after the addition of Protein A-Sepharose. Most experiments were controlled for nonspecific immunoreactivity by immunoprecipitations with the specific anti-AP IgG in the presence of an excess of the corresponding recombinant fusion antigen protein. Also, preimmune rabbit serum or unrelated rabbit IgG (Sigma) were used for nonspecific control precipitations. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with TGH supplemented with 100 mM NaCl and then once with TGH. Typically, 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used to separate proteins. In indicated experiments, 6 M urea was included in the separating gel as described elsewhere (19Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) to separate α- and β-subunits. Transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and protein immunoblotting were carried out as described(34Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sheep antibodies to mouse IgG (Cappel Inc.) or protein A (Zymed Inc.) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham or DuPont NEN) were used to detect primary mouse or rabbit antibodies, respectively. Stripping of the antibodies from the membrane was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham). Several films obtained after various lengths of exposure times with the same blot were analyzed to measure optical density within a linear range of sensitivity. A Bio-Rad densitometer was used for quantitation. Cells in 150-mm dishes were incubated with 300 ng/ml EGF in binding medium (DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.3) at 4°C for 40-60 min to saturate receptors and then placed in a 37°C water bath to allow endocytosis for the indicated times. Medium in the culture dishes reached 37°C within 2 min. At the end of the 37°C incubation, the cells were washed with CMF-PBS and solubilized in TGH, as described above. Lysates were then centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 20 min to minimize nonspecific associations and for removal of possible AP-2 aggregates. Supernatants, representing equal amounts of cells, were immunoprecipitated with a saturating amount of antibody 986 to the EGF receptor or Ab31 to the αC-subunit. Immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and transfer to nitrocellulose were performed as described above. The top (above the 116-kDa molecular mass marker) and bottom portions of the nitrocellulose membrane were blotted with antibody 2913 to the EGF receptor and antibody AC1-M11 to α-subunits, respectively. In experiments with Dc214 receptor, monoclonal antibody to EGF receptor (LA22) was used for blotting. Sheep antibodies to mouse IgG, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, or 125 I-Protein A (ICN Biochemical) was used to detect primary antibodies. To analyze radioactivity, blots were exposed to x-ray films and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Chemiluminescence signals were detected and analyzed by densitometry. The nonspecific precipitation of AP-2 by nonimmune rabbit IgG used in the same quantity as antibody 986 to EGF receptor was negligible (0.1-0.2% of total AP-2) compared to the specific association of AP-2 with the EGF receptor. Nonspecific association of EGF receptors with control IgG was in some experiments comparable with the specific co-immunoprecipitations with anti-AP IgG and varied with the source of control IgG used. Therefore, immunoprecipitation with Ab31 in the presence of αC-ear-linker peptide was used to control for nonspecific associations. To determine specific co-precipitation of the receptor with AP-2, the amount of EGF receptors in nonspecific immunoprecipitates was subtracted from that amount recovered in the immunoprecipitates in the absence of αC-ear-linker. In experiments comparing AP-2 association with wild-type and Dc214 EGF receptor mutant, potassium depletion of cells was performed as described (31Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 39Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Andersen R.G.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) to normalize AP-2 association with receptors. In brief, cells were subjected to hypotonic shock by incubation in DMEM/water (1:1) at 37°C for 5 min. Cells were further incubated in buffer “A” (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.3) at 37°C for 1 h and subsequently with EGF (300 ng/ml) in buffer “B” (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mM CaCl2) for 40 min at 4°C. Finally, cells were placed in the 37°C water bath for 15 min to allow receptor•AP-2 association (31Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Control cells were incubated for 5 min in DMEM instead of 50% DMEM and in buffer “C” (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM KCl) instead of buffers A and B. Subconfluent cells grown in 35-mm dishes were incubated for 24 h in methionine-free Modified Eagle's medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum and Tran 35 S-label (DuPont NEN) (80 μCi/ml). To measure the turnover of radiolabeled AP-2, the cells were washed with nonradioactive DMEM and further incubated in DMEM containing 1% calf serum and 2 mM methionine for 0-48 h at 37°C. Under these conditions, the amount of total cellular protein usually increased by not more than 10-20% during the labeling period and 48-h “chase.” Incubation was terminated by washing the cells with cold CMF-PBS. The cells were then solubilized in TGH, and lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. AP-2 containing αC-subunits were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with Ab31 to αC-subunit in the presence or absence of an excess αC-ear-linker fragment. 0.5 M NaCl was present in the immunoprecipitations, as well as in the two washes of the immunoprecipitates to decrease nonspecific radioactivity. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 7-11% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels to obtain maximum resolution in the 100-kDa region of the gel and to detect proteins migrating above the 14-kDa molecular mass marker. In some experiments, urea-containing gels were used as described (19Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) to separate α- and β-subunits. Either gels were dried or proteins were transferred to PolyScreen transfer membrane (DuPont NEN Research Products). To detect radiolabeled proteins, gels and transfer membranes were exposed to PhosphorImager screens or x-ray films. The transfer membranes were also incubated with antibodies to the large subunits of APs, which were detected by chemiluminescence. 35 S-Labeled bands were then matched with the immunoreactive bands detected by blotting. Confluent cells grown in 250-mm2 dishes were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine (0.50-0.75 mCi/dish, 20-25 μCi/ml) for 24 h as described above. Cells were rinsed with nonradioactive DMEM and incubated in DMEM for 15 min at 37°C. To saturate surface receptors, the cells were incubated at 4°C for 40 min in binding medium supplemented with 300 ng/ml EGF. To initiate AP-2 association with EGF receptors, the cells were subsequently incubated for 7 min at 37°C. Cells were then washed with CMF-PBS, scraped in 2 ml of ice-cold TGH, and transferred into tubes. Tubes were gently rotated to solubilize membranes for 10 min at 4°C and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 20 min. To isolate EGF receptors and receptor-associated proteins, supernatants from two dishes were combined, mixed with 80 μl of EGF-Affi-Gel, and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The EGF-Affi-Gel was then washed in TGH, incubated for 10 min in TGH, and washed again with TGH. The absorbed EGF receptors (and proteins associated with the receptors) were eluted from the EGF-Affi-Gel by incubation in 0.8 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 1 mg/ml EGF and TGH for 1 h at 4°C. To isolate AP-2 bound to receptors, 2 equal aliquots of the eluent from the EGF affinity column were immunoprecipitated with Ab31 to αC-subunit in the absence or presence of recombinant αC-ear-linker protein (300 ng). Protein A-Sepharose immunoprecipitates were washed twice with TGH containing 100 mM NaCl and twice in TGH without NaCl. The immunoprecipitates were then separated on 7-11% gradient SDS-gels. In some experiments, 3-15% gels were used to enable detection of a larger molecular weight range of proteins. After the gels were fixed and dried, radiolabeled proteins were analyzed with a PhosphorImager or exposed to x-ray film. In some experiments, proteins were transferred to PolyScreen transfer membrane. To detect radiolabeled proteins, transfer membranes were exposed to the PhosphorImager screens or x-ray films. Then the transfer membranes were incubated with various antibodies to APs and EGF receptor, which were detected by chemiluminescence. 35 S-Labeled bands were then matched with the bands detected by blotting. A previous study demonstrated the presence of AP-2 in immunoprecipitates of EGF receptors from cells treated with EGF at 37°C(31Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To further investigate the nature of receptor interaction with AP-2, antibodies capable of immunoprecipitating native AP-2 complexes from cell extracts were required. Therefore, recombinant proteins corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal portions of the αC and β2 subunits of rat brain AP-2 were employed as antigens to generate Ab31 and Ab32, respectively. Results of Western blotting analysis and immunoprecipitation of APs from mouse NIH 3T3 cells are summarized in Table 1. Ab31 recognizes αC (≈102 kDa), but not the related αA isoform. Ab32 recognizes both β1 (≈105 kDa) and β2 (≈102 kDa) isoforms. These results were confirmed with monoclonal antibody AC1-M11 that in blotting analysis detects both αA (≈105 kDa) and αC, and with monoclonal antibody B1-M6 that recognizes β1 and β2(35Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). AP-2 complexes precipitated by Ab31 were composed exclusively of αC and predominantly β2 subunits. A small amount of the β1 subunit was detected in Ab31 immunoprecipitates. Presumably, a minor fraction of AP-2 may incorporate the β1 subunit instead of β2. 2W. Boll, K. Clairmont, and T. Kirchhausen, manuscript in preparation. Tabled 1 Ab32 was effective in immunoprecipitating a random sample of all available APs. Comparative blotting of Ab32 precipitates and cellular lysates with AC1-M11 indicates that in NIH 3T3 cells approximately 60-70% of the solubilized AP-2 pool contains the αC isoform. Consistently, we estimate that the αC antibody (Ab31) precipitates approximately 60-70% of the total solubilized AP-2 pool in NIH 3T3 cells. In subsequent experiments, Ab31 was used to minimize analysis of large subunits of AP-2 components, such as β1, that are considered characteristic of AP-1. The time course of AP-2•EGF receptor association after EGF stimulation was examined using mouse NIH 3T3 cells expressing wild-type human EGF receptors (WT cells). The cells were incubated with a saturating concentration of EGF at 4°C for 40 min and then transferred to 37°C to permit endocytosis. At the indicated times, cells were solubilized, and AP-2 or EGF receptors were immunoprecipitated, respectively, with Ab31 to αC subunit or antibody 986 to EGF receptor (Fig. 1). After electrophoresis, the primary antigen and the co-precipitating proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A (lanes 1-10), the pool of EGF receptors co-immunoprecipitated with αC-subunit was relatively small, typically 0.3-0.6% of the total cellular pool of EGF receptors. Immunoprecipitation with Ab31 in the presence of excess recombinant αC-ear-linker antigen (Fig. 1A, lanes 6-10) was used to demonstrate specificity of the primary antibody. In Fig. 1B, quantitation of the data shown in Fig. 1A, lanes 1-10, indicates that co-immunoprecipitation of EGF receptors with AP-2 reached a maximum at 6-8 min following the shift to 37°C and subsequently declined at more extended incubation times (Fig. 1B, closed circles). These results are consistent with the time course of EGF internalization (34Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the kinetics of EGF appearance in clathrin-coated vesicles(7Hanover J.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Cell. 1984; 39: 283-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 1A (lanes 11-15) demonstrate the converse, i.e. that AP-2 co-immunoprecipitates with EGF receptors. Both αA- and αC-subunit isoforms (typically 2-4% of total solubilized α-subunit pool) were co-immunoprecipitated with EGF receptors. A similar amount of AP-2 was associated with EGF receptors when cells were exposed to EGF at 37°C without preincubation at 4°C (data not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation of AP-2 with EGF receptors also reached a maximum at 6-8 min following the shift to 37°C (Fig. 1B, open circles). These resu"

In addition to binding LRP, RAP binds two other members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, gp330 and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptors. Here, we show that RAP binds to LDL receptors as well. In normal human foreskin fibroblasts, RAP inhibited LDL receptor-mediated binding and catabolism of LDL and VLDL with Sf 20-60 or 100-400. RAP inhibited 125 I-labeled LDL and Sf 100-400 lipoprotein binding at 4°C with KI values of 60 and 45 nM, respectively. The effective concentrations for 50% inhibition (EC50 ) of cellular degradation of 2.0 nM 125 I-labeled LDL, 4.7 nM 125 I-labeled Sf 20-60, and 3.6 nM 125 I-labeled Sf 100-400 particles were 40, 70, and 51 nM, respectively. Treatment of cells with lovastatin to induce LDL receptors increased cellular binding, internalization, and degradation of RAP by 2.3-, 1.7-, and 2.6-fold, respectively. In solid-phase assays, RAP bound to partially purified LDL receptors in a dose-dependent manner. The dissociation constant (KD ) of RAP binding to LDL receptors in the solid-phase assay was 250 nM, which is higher than that for LRP, gp330, or VLDL receptors in similar assays by a factor of 14 to 350. Also, RAP inhibited 125 I-labeled LDL and Sf 100-400 VLDL binding to LDL receptors in solid-phase assays with KI values of 140 and 130 nM, respectively. Because LDL bind via apolipoprotein (apo) B100 whereas VLDL bind via apoE, our results show that RAP inhibits LDL receptor interactions with both apoB100 and apoE. These studies establish that RAP is capable of binding to LDL receptors and modulating cellular catabolism of LDL and VLDL by this pathway.

Based on data for 10 normal doublets and for doublets containing a mispaired or analog base, the correlation of ΔS° with ΔH° follows a rectangular hyperbola. Doublet melting temperature relates linearly to ΔH° by Tm = To +ΔH°/a, where To ≈ 273 K and a ≈ 80 cal/mol-K. Thus Tm is proportional to ΔH°+ aTo rather than to ΔH° alone as previously thought by assuming ΔS° to be constant.

The solvent entropy change (aTo /Tm ) declines with increasing Tm , while the DNA entropy change (ΔH°/Tm ) rises, so the combined DNA + solvent entropy change stays constant at 80 cal/K/mol of doublet. If such constancy in DNA + solvent entropy changes also holds for enzyme clefts as “solvent,” then free energy differences for competing correct and incorrect base pairs in polymerase clefts may be as large as enthalpy differences and possibly sufficient to account for DNA polymerase accuracy.

Such studies indicate that double helix stability can be predicted in terms of the standard free energy change, ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°, if one knows the standard enthalpy and entropy changes (ΔH° and ΔS°) for the melting of each nearest-neighbor doublet of base pairs in DNA(9Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Normal B-form helical DNA, with Watson-Crick base pairs stabilized by nearest-neighbor base stacking, has 10 possible kinds of nearest-neighbor doublets. For the melting of each doublet, ΔH° and ΔS° have been evaluated experimentally in 1 M NaCl but only Tm (ΔH°/ΔS°) has been measured at lower salt concentrations. In this paper we provide a formula to describe the relationship between ΔH° and ΔS° measured in 1 M salt and show how standard enthalpy and entropy changes may be evaluated from Tm at lower salt concentrations to predict B-DNA stability under more physiologically relevant conditions.The focal point of this work pertains to “enthalpy-entropy compensation,” the strong correlation between enthalpy and entropy changes observed for molecular association/dissociation reactions in aqueous solution and attributed to water's influence as solvent (12Lumry R.

The hyperbolic curve that we obtain by fitting normal doublet data (4Aboul-ela F. Koh D. Tinoco I.J. Martin F.H.

A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) also applies to the melting of doublets containing base mispairs (4Aboul-ela F. Koh D. Tinoco I.J. Martin F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4811-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 7Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpressing DNA Melting Temperature as an Average of Doublet Tm ValuesThe formula used to describe the melting temperature of a DNA double helix in terms of nearest-neighbor doublets has been derived previously by assuming that ΔS, the entropy change upon melting, is the same for all doublets. If ΔS is constant, then each doublet has a melting temperature in degrees Kelvin (Tm = ΔH/ΔS) directly proportional to ΔH, the enthalpy change upon melting. This supposition was made originally by Gotoh and Tagashira (8Gotoh O. Tagashira Y. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1033-1042Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and more recently by Delcourt and Blake(10Delcourt S.G. Blake R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15160-15169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to evaluate doublet melting temperatures and enthalpy changes from Tm measurements on duplexes of known base sequence. The reasoning is as follows.A DNA duplex with n base pairs (bp), having the first bp stacked on the second, the second on the third, etc., has n-1 doublets of stacked bp contributing to duplex stability. For each doublet (MN) there is a characteristic enthalpy change upon melting (ΔHMN ) that depends on the stacking interaction between nearest neighbors M and N. The average enthalpy change per mole of doublet in the duplex is given by ΔH=∑ΔHMNfMN(Eq. 1) where fMN is the mole fraction of doublet MN and ∑ is the sum for all MN types in the duplex. In terms of the two strands in the duplex, MN means MN/M′N′, i.e. base sequence 5′-MN-3′ on one strand paired with complementary base sequence 3′-M′N′-5′ on the opposite strand. Since the two strands are antiparallel, MN/M′N′ is equivalent to N′M′/NM, so there are 10 distinct MN types arising from the 16 possible nearest-neighbor base sequences in normal DNA.Corresponding to ΔH given by, the average entropy change per mole of doublet is ΔS = ΔH/Tm, where Tm is the duplex melting temperature in degrees Kelvin. If all doublets have the same entropy change, i.e. ΔSMN = ΔHMN /TMN = c, then the duplex Tm value is an average of doublet Tm values, Tm=∑TMNfMN(Eq. 2) where TMN = ΔHMN /c is the Tm value for doublet MN. This formula applies to DNA duplexes that are long enough so that end effects are negligible, and Tm is practically independent of strand concentration. In the case of short duplexes, the sum in is multiplied by a factor less than 1, about (n-1)/n, to account for the decrease in Tm with decreasing n because of end effects(1Martin F.H. Uhlenbeck O.C. Doty P. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 57: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2Porschke D. Biopolymers. 1971; 10: 1989-2013Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and another term is required to describe Tm dependence on strand concentration(4Aboul-ela F. Koh D. Tinoco I.J. Martin F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4811-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar).Measurements of DNA Melting Temperatures at Various Salt Concentrations-has been used to describe DNA melting temperatures in terms of doublet Tm values, for duplexes of length 100 bp or greater, in salt solutions of low ionic strength, μ = 0.020 M(8Gotoh O. Tagashira Y. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1033-1042Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and 0.075 M(10Delcourt S.G. Blake R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15160-15169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In such low concentrations of salt, long duplexes have melting temperatures sufficiently below the boiling point of water to be measured accurately. By a least-squares fit to duplex Tm values obtained for a wide range of known base sequences, self-consistent TMN values have have been determined for all normal MN doublets in 0.020 and 0.075 M NaCl. The corresponding “constant” doublet entropy change (ΔSMN = c) at these NaCl concentrations were estimated to be c = 24 cal/mol-K and 25 cal/mol-K, respectively, for the purpose of evaluating ΔHMN = cTMN for each doublet(8Gotoh O. Tagashira Y. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1033-1042Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Delcourt S.G. Blake R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15160-15169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In salt solutions of 1 M or above, Tm for long DNA duplexes may exceed the boiling point of water and so cannot be measured directly, but short duplexes of 10 bp or less have Tm values low enough to be measured accurately over a wide range of total strand concentration (Ct). Tinoco and co-workers (4Aboul-ela F. Koh D. Tinoco I.J. Martin F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4811-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) have shown that the equilibrium constant (Keq ) for duplex dissociation at Tm has the value Ct/4 ideally, so the corresponding standard free energy change is ΔGo=-RTlnKeq=RTmln(4/Ct)=ΔHo-TmΔS∞(Eq. 3) For each short (7-10 bp) duplex examined, a van't Hoff plot of Rln(4/Ct) versus 1/Tm was found to give a straight line with slope and intercept yielding ΔH° and ΔS° values for the duplex(4Aboul-ela F. Koh D. Tinoco I.J. Martin F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4811-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 7Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A.

A. 1988; 85: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This experimental (van't Hoff) method of measuring ΔH° and ΔS° has been confirmed by Breslauer and co-workers (9Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) using calorimetry. A systematic replacement of one bp by another in short duplexes enabled Breslauer and co-workers to evaluate ΔH°MN and ΔS°MN for each normal doublet in 1 M NaCl (Table 1).Tabled 1Effect of Increasing DNA Strand LengthAs duplexes are made longer, their enthalpy and entropy changes increase with the number of doublets and the contribution from Ct becomes less significant. This effect can be seen by dividing by Tm and by n-1, to obtain for an average doublet, ΔH°/Tm = ΔS°+ R[ln(4/Ct)]/(n-1). For long duplexes, with n = 100-1000 and Ct = 10-5-10-6M, the term R[ln(4/Ct)]/(n-1) is only 0.03 to 0.3 cal/mol-K, which is negligible compared to ΔS° of 20-25 cal/mol-K for the average doublet. Thus, doublet Tm values obtained from long duplexes of 100 bp or more at μ = 0.020 M(8Gotoh O. Tagashira Y. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1033-1042Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and 0.075 M(10Delcourt S.G. Blake R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15160-15169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are essentially equivalent to ΔH°/ΔS° for the doublets at these two ionic strengths.RESULTSFormulation of Enthalpy-Entropy Compensation Enthalpy-Entropy Compensation Fits a Rectangular HyperbolaTable 1 shows the ΔH° and ΔS° values obtained for normal DNA doublets by applying van't Hoff analysis and calorimetry to short duplexes in 1 M NaCl(4Aboul-ela F.

A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Clearly ΔS° is not constant but varies with ΔH°. A plot of ΔS° versus ΔH°, including doublets containing base mispairs, indicates a correlation (Fig. 1a) similar to the enthalpy-entropy compensation attributed to the influence of water as solvent in protein interactions (12Lumry R. Rajender S. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1125-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) and drug-DNA binding(13Breslauer K.J. Remeta D.P. Chou W.-Y. Ferrante R. Curry J. Zaunczkowski D. Snyder J.G.

In a, the standard entropy change, ΔS°, evaluated for melting in 1 M NaCl, is shown plotted against the corresponding enthalpy change, ΔH°, for each nearest-neighbor doublet of base pairs in normal DNA (9Breslauer K.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4811-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Eight of the 10 normal doublets are represented by solid circles (•) and two by open circles (○). The latter are doublets TG/AC and GA/CT, whose values (9Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) appear anomalous by comparison with results for doublet combinations(4Aboul-ela F. Koh D. Tinoco I.J. Martin F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4811-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), (TG/AC + GT/CA)/2 and (GA/CT + AG/TC)/2, represented by solid squares ( ■ ). Doublet combinations containing a mispair (TX/AY + XT/YA)/2 are represented by open squares (□). The solid curve is the rectangular hyperbola, described by, fitted by nonlinear regression to the eight solid circles and two solid squares. The dashed line is a linear least-squares fit to the same normal doublet data. In b is shown a similar plot for melting in 0.1 M NaCl, using ΔS° and ΔH° obtained for internal doublet combinations, (TX/AY + XT/YA)/2, where X/Y is a normal base pair ( ■ ), a mismatched base pair (□), or a pair containing the base analogue, O6-methyl G (▵). Each doublet combination is evaluated from triplet (TXT/AYA) in the center of the 9-bp duplex(7Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), (GTTTXTTTG/CAAAYAAAC), as described in text. The solid curve and dashed line are the same as shown in a.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results raise an interesting question: how can enthalpy-entropy compensation be formulated, consistent with the observation that Tm relates to doublets in the simple manner(8Gotoh O. Tagashira Y. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1033-1042Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Delcourt S.G. Blake R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15160-15169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described by? A straight-line approximation of ΔS° versus ΔH°, shown by the dashed line in Fig. 1a, is unsatisfactory because the line intersects the ΔS° axis at a positive value. The value of ΔS° cannot remain positive when ΔH° becomes negative because Tm = ΔH°/ΔS° would then become negative on the Kelvin scale, which is physically impossible.A satisfactory fit to the data is obtained with a rectangular hyperbola (Fig. 1, solid line). An analytic expression for the hyperbolic curve is generated simply by introducing a constant(To) in the linear relationship between Tm and ΔH°, Tm=To+ΔHoa(Eq. 4) Substitution of ΔH°/ΔS° for Tm in and solving for ΔS° results in the enthalpy-entropy compensation formula, ΔSo=aΔHoaTo+ΔHo(Eq. 5) This expression for ΔS° versus ΔH° has the form of a rectangular hyperbola passing through the origin (ΔH° = 0, ΔS° = 0). Near the origin, where ΔH° is much less than aTo, ΔS° is close to ΔH°/To, since the initial slope is 1/To. However, as ΔH° increases, the slope decreases continuously as ΔS° approaches a. With ΔH° related to doublets by and ΔS° described by, Tm = ΔH°/ΔS° remains related to doublets as in, Tm=To+ΔHoa=∑TMNfMN(Eq. 6) where TMN = To+ (ΔH°MN /a) is the Tm value for doublet MN, with ΔH°MN being its standard enthalpy change upon melting.The constant To may reflect the influence of solvent on DNA melting. If Tm were simply proportional to ΔH°, then at ΔH° = 0, the melting temperature would be 0 K, as expected for melting in vacuum. The presence of solvent may provide a resistance to DNA melting, so that as ΔH° approaches 0, the melting temperature approaches To > 0 K. Thus, Tm in degrees Kelvin is proportional to ΔH°+ aTo rather than to ΔH° alone, and instead of the DNA entropy change, ΔS° = ΔH°/Tm, being constant for all doublets, we now have the DNA + solvent entropy change, (ΔH°+ aTo)/Tm, equal to the constant a. The higher To is above 0 K, the higher a is above ΔS° = ΔH°/Tm. The constants a and To can be evaluated by fitting to the experimental data (Fig. 1) and, as shown below, To is within experimental error the same as the melting temperature of ice.Evaluation of Enthalpy-Entropy Compensation ConstantsTo evaluate To and a in, we make use of the ΔH° and ΔS° calorimetric values assigned to the 10 normal doublets in 1 M NaCl (9Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blocker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) and also van't Hoff measurements for two of the doublets, TG/AC and GA/CT (see Table 1). The plot of ΔS° versus ΔH° (Fig. 1a) shows eight points (solid circles) falling on a smooth curve or straight line while two (open circles) fall slightly below this trend. We do not use the two low points in fitting because van't Hoff measurements (4Aboul-ela F. Koh D. Tinoco I.J. Martin F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4811-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) for the same two doublets combined with their reverse counterparts (TG/AC + GT/CA)/2 and (GA/CT + AG/TC)/2 yielded higher points (solid squares) in much better agreement with the trend. Using the latter two points instead, we provide the alternative assignments shown in brackets in Table 1.The solid curve in Fig. 1a is the hyperbola described by fitted by nonlinear regression to the 10 points represented by the (eight) solid circles and (two) solid squares. For comparison, a dashed straight line showing the result of a linear least-squares fit to the same 10 points is also presented. By comparing the hyperbolic curve and straight line (Fig. 1a) with additional points (open squares) obtained for various X/Y mispairs (4Aboul-ela F. Koh D. Tinoco I.J. Martin F.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4811-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) in the doublet combination, (TX/AY + XT/YA)/2, we see that the curve successfully predicts the trend of mispair data whereas the straight line does not.The hyperbolic curve fitted by nonlinear regression yields To = 275 K and a = 81 cal/mol-K. Similar results, To = 273 ± 13 K and a = 79 ± 9 cal/mol-K, are obtained by rearranging to give linear expressions, ΔH°/ΔS°versus ΔH° and ΔH° versus ΔH°/ΔS°, to which linear regression is applied as in the Hanes-Woolf method of fitting the rectangular hyperbola in Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics(15Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar).Thus for normal DNA doublets in 1 M NaCl, we find To is close to 273 K (ice melting point) and a is about 80 cal/mol-K, with an uncertainty of ±15 degrees and ±10 cal/mol-K, respectively. Within this margin of error, the same constant values may be expected to hold at lower salt concentrations also, since the melting point of ice differs by less than 5 degrees between 0 and 1 M NaCl. As shown in Fig. 1b, this expectation is supported by measurements in 0.1 M NaCl (7Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) for doublet combinations of type, (TX/AY + XT/YA)/2, where X/Y includes normal pairs, mispairs, and also pairs and mispairs with the base analog, O6-methyl G.Analysis of Salt Effects on Doublet Thermodynamic Values Thermodynamic Evaluations for Base Pairs and Mispairs at Lower Salt ConcentrationGaffney and Jones(7Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), using the van't Hoff method based on, have obtained thermodynamic data in 0.1 M NaCl for short (9 bp) duplexes containing various internal base pairs or mispairs (X/Y) at the center, including the base analog, O6-methyl G. We have analyzed their data to evaluate ΔH° and ΔS° for various doublet combinations at the center of the duplex. We start by calculating ΔS° for each 9 bp duplex, using the reported ΔH° and Tmax measurements at 10 -4M strand concentration; Tmax being a melting temperature, slightly different from Tm, measured at the maximum slope of the melting curve instead of the midpoint. To obtain ΔS°, we take ΔH°/Tmax measured at Ct = 10 -4M and subtract 20.1 cal/mol-K; the latter being a constant correction factor, consisting of 1.8 cal/mol-K (correction for the difference between Tmax and Tm) and 18.3 cal/mol-K (value of RlnCt). The formula, ΔS° = (ΔH°/Tmax) - 20.1 cal/mol-K, is applied to each duplex, D = GGTTXTTGG/CCAAYAACC. From the measured ΔH°(D) and calculated ΔS°(D), we subtract estimates of ΔH° and ΔS° for D with internal triplet Tr deleted, ΔH°(D-Tr) = 55 (±1) kcal/mol and ΔS°(D-Tr) = 166 (±2) cal/mol-K, to obtain ΔH°(Tr) and ΔS°(Tr) for the internal triplet, Tr = TXT/AYA. The values, ΔH°(Tr)/2 and ΔS°(Tr)/2, are then assigned to the doublet combinations, (TX/AY + XT/YA)/2.Fig. 1b shows a plot of ΔS° versus ΔH° for the melting of these doublet combinations in comparison with the same (solid) hyperbolic curve and (dashed) straight line drawn in Fig. 1a. The data are consistent with a hyperbola describing enthalpy-entropy compensation and not a straight line. Since the data fall on or near the same curve as in Fig. 1a, they indicate that the same compensation constants evaluated for normal DNA doublets in 1 M NaCl also hold at 0.1 M NaCl. Furthermore, since the doublet combinations include O6-methyl G (open triangles) along with normal base pairs (solid squares) and mispairs (open squares), it appears that To≈ 273 K and a ≈ 80 cal/mol-K apply even when DNA bases are chemically modified.Evaluation of TmDependence on Salt ConcentrationThe last column in Table 1 shows the melting temperature calculated for each normal doublet of base pairs in 1.0 M NaCl by applying and to ΔH° and ΔS°, including the alternative assignments given in brackets. The Tm value shown in each case is the average (± deviation from average) of two calculated results, one being Tm = To+ΔH°/a and the other being the mean of Tm = aTo/(ΔS°-a) and Tm = ΔH°/ΔS°. Although these two calculations are obviously not independent, they do serve to provide an internal consistency check of ΔH° and ΔS°, since one selects ΔH° and the other emphasizes ΔS°. The deviation from average of the two results indicates the degree of uncertainty in the Tm values predicted.For the majority of doublets, the predicted Tm values (Table 1) are above 100°C, as one might expect by extrapolation from lower salt concentrations(10Delcourt S.G. Blake R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15160-15169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the uncertainty (± deviation from average) is acceptable for all the original assignments, except for the two doublets TG/AC and GA/CT, shown as open circles falling below the curve in Fig. 1a. The alternative assignments (Table 1, in brackets) reduce the uncertainty from ± 21° and ± 15° to much lower values (± 6° and ± 5°, respectively), close to those found for the other doublets.Table 2 shows a comparison of our calculated Tm values at μ = 1 M with experimental results obtained at two lower ionic strengths, μ = 0.02 M(8Gotoh O. Tagashira Y. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1033-1042Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and 0.075 M(10Delcourt S.G. Blake R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15160-15169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calculated and experimental results are consistent in showing that seven of the 10 normal doublets have a large Tm dependence on μ, while three have only a small dependence. Since duplex Tm values tend to show a linear dependence on logμ, the following linear formula has been suggested(16Blake R.D. Delcourt S.G. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), Tm=T1.0+Slogμ(Eq. 7) Tabled 1where T1.0 is the Tm value at μ = 1.0 and S is a characteristic slope for each doublet, in degrees/unit change in logμ.According to, if one evaluates ΔTm/Δlogμ, using the Tm difference (ΔTm) between any two μ values (μ1 and μ2, with Δlogμ = logμ1 - logμ2), one should find an approximately constant S value for each doublet. The last column in Table 2 shows the average value of S = ΔTm/Δlogμ (± deviation from average) calculated from corresponding Tm and logμ differences between each pair of preceding columns. As seen in Table 2(last column), seven of the 10 normal DNA doublets have similarly large S values, ranging from 42 to 25 degrees/unit change in logμ, while the other three have much smaller values (7 or less).The three doublets with small S all have base G in position 1 of the doublet, namely GT/CA, GA/CT, and GC/CG. In contrast, all the doublets with G in position 2, namely CG/GC, GG/CC, TG/AC, and AG/TC, have some of the largest S values. CG/GC has the highest value of T1.0 ( ~ 149°C) and largest value of S ( ~ 42) of all normal doublets. Its reverse counterpart GC/CG has the second highest T1.0 ( ~ 139°C) but smallest S ( ~ 0). These results suggest that CG/GC is the most stable of all doublets at 1 M ionic strength or above, while GC/CG is the most stable at lower ionic strengths.DISCUSSIONThe hyperbolic variation of ΔS° with ΔH° observed experimentally (Fig. 1, a and b) indicates a significant enthalpy-entropy compensation in DNA melting thermodynamics. This behavior shows that Tm = ΔH°/ΔS° is not proportional to ΔH°, as previously suggested(8Gotoh O. Tagashira Y. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1033-1042Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Delcourt S.G.

This equation includes a melting temperature constant, To, which is introduced as a parameter to represent the complex and poorly understood influence of solvent on DNA stability.The inclusion of To leads to an expression for enthalpy-entropy compensation in the form of a rectangular hyperbola,. The hyperbolic curve obtained by fitting experimental data for normal doublets in 1 M NaCl (Fig. 1a) indicates that To is close to the melting temperature of ice. The same hyperbolic curve, with no further adjustment of the two parameters (To and a) appears to hold reasonably well for mispaired doublets in 1 M NaCl (Fig. 1a) and for both normal and mispaired double"

INTRODUCTIONThe photoinactivation of photosystem II and the degradation of the D1 protein subunit of its reaction center (RCII) 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: RCIIreaction center IIChlchlorophyllDiuron3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl ureaQA and QBthe primary and secondary quinone electron acceptors of reaction center II, respectively3P680triplet state of the primary electron donor chlorophyll of RCIITLthermoluminescencePFDphoton flux densityPQ and PQH2plastoquinone and plastoquinol, respectivelyP680 and P680 +the reduced and oxidized form of the primary electron donor of RCII, respectivelyYz +the oxidized form of the electron donor to P680 + , the Tyr-161 amino acid residue of the D1 proteinwtwild type. have been extensively studied in photosynthetic oxygen evolving organisms exposed to light intensities higher than those required for saturation of photosynthetic electron flow (reviewed by Prasil et al.(1992), Barber and Andersson (1992), Aro et al.(1993), and Ohad et al. (1994)). It is now well established that photoinactivation induces irreversible changes in RCII-D1 targeting the D1 protein for degradation both, in vitro (Aro et al., 1990) and in vivo (Ohad et al., 1990b; Kirilovsky et al., 1990; Zer et al., 1994).Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the degradation of the D1 protein induced by high light. Generation of high ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane and acidification of the thylakoid lumen may lead to release of Ca 2+ from the oxygen evolving complex and inactivate the photosystem II donor side (Ono and Inoue, 1989; Krieger et al., 1992; Krieger and Weis, 1993). Under such conditions oxidizing cation radicals, Yz + and P680 + may be formed within RCII with a high quantum yield (Eckert et al., 1991), which may induce irreversible modifications of its protein subunit(s) and thus target the D1 protein for degradation. Alternatively, alteration of the RCII acceptor side activity may lead to a block in the electron transfer from QA - , the first quinone acceptor, to the secondary quinone QB, followed by double reduction of QA, and eventually its release from the binding site located within the D2 protein subunit of RCII (Andersson and Franzen, 1992). This may in turn cause charge recombination of the RCII radical pair P680 + /pheophytin - , resulting in formation of 3P680 , which may interact with oxygen and generate harmful singlet oxygen (Van Mieghem et al., 1989; Durrant et al., 1990; Vass et al., 1992b; Hideg et al., 1994). Accelerated light-dependent degradation of the D1 protein in cyanobacterial mutant cells defective in QA - /QB electron flow due to replacements of single amino acids in the QB - binding niche of the D1 protein indicates that this mechanism may operate in vivo (N. Ohad et al., 1990a; Perewoska et al., 1994). Mutants impaired in the photosystem II donor side activity exhibit high sensitivity to light (Mayes et al., 1991; Burnap et al., 1992, Rova et al., 1994) and enhanced degradation of the RCII-D1 protein as compared to the wild type cells (Gong and Ohad, 1991).The mechanisms of acceptor or donor side inactivation are mutually exclusive and account for the intermediary steps in RCII inactivation preceding D1 protein degradation and occurring only at high light intensities (Ohad et al., 1994). However, turnover of the RCII-D1 protein occurs also in vivo at light intensities well below those inducing photoinactivation (Greenberg et al., 1987). Thus the mechanisms based on the donor or acceptor side photoinactivation preceding the degradation of the D1 protein do not apply in this case, since no detectable loss of photosystem II activity can be measured unless de novo synthesis of D1 protein is inhibited, thus preventing replacement of the degraded protein.Most of the studies of D1 protein turnover in vivo are based on radioactive pulse-chase experiments (Greenberg et al., 1987; Jansen et al., 1993; Sundby et al., 1993; Aro et al., 1994). Measurements of the rate of D1 protein degradation relative to light intensity over a wide range of PFDs and assayed by quantitative immunodetection of the remaining total D1 protein are not available for the same organism under standard experimental conditions. When such experiments were carried out in this work, low light was unexpectedly found to be more efficient in inducing D1 protein degradation as compared to high light.At low light intensities the probability of accumulating long-lived (seconds) RCII-QB - increases as compared to that of other intermediate steps in RCII electron flow (less than milliseconds). QB - may decay by charge recombination (back reaction) with the S2,3 oxidized states of the Mn cluster in the oxygen evolving complex (Rutherford, 1989). Back reactions in photosystem II in low light-exposed chloroplasts have been considered in the past to reduce photosynthetic efficiency (Radmer and Kok, 1977). In the process of back reaction from QB - to the S2,3 states, triplet Chl may be generated during the transient formation of the radical pair P680 + /pheophytin - (Van Gorkom et al., 1986; Rutherford, 1989; Volk et al., 1993). 3Chl may interact with oxygen forming harmful singlet oxygen (Hideg et al., 1994). Here we propose that accumulation of RCII-QB - in low light-exposed thylakoids may be related to the low light-induced rapid turnover of the D1 protein in vivo. To test this hypothesis advantage was taken from the fact that oscillations in the QB - level may be induced by series of single or multiple light flashes. We have thus exposed dark-incubated algal cells to series of short duration light flashes and were able to demonstrate oscillations of D1 protein degradation related to the oscillations of the QB - level induced by the various flash regimes. Thus a correlation is established between the degradation of the D1 protein in vivo and the generation of QB - /S2,3 states induced by light flashes or low light. This may explain the low light-induced degradation and ensuing replacement (turnover) of the D1 protein in vivo. The damaging mechanism whereby charge recombination between QB - and the S2,3 states induces triggering of the D1 protein for degradation remains to be established.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Growth and Exposure to Different PFDsChlamydomonas reinhardtii y-1 and Scenedesmus obliquus wt and LF-1 mutant cells were grown as described before in a mineral medium containing acetate or glucose as carbon source, respectively (Ohad et al., 1967; Gong and Ohad, 1991). The LF-1 Scenedesmus mutant is impaired in the donor side activity of photosystem II (Diner et al., 1988). The mutant is highly light-sensitive and RCII is inactivated in light-grown cells. To maintain equal growth conditions, both the wt and LF-1 mutant were thus grown in the dark. Dark-grown wt and LF-1 Scenedesmus cells contain normally developed thylakoids and wt cells exhibit normal levels of photosynthetic activity when transferred to the light. Photosystem II is also present and functional in the dark-grown LF-1 mutant as measured with an artificial electron donor. Cultures were harvested in the exponential phase of growth. Cell suspensions in fresh growth medium (30 μg of chlorophyll ml -1 ) were exposed to various PFDs provided by white fluorescent (0-100 μmol m -2 s -1 ) or tungsten halogen lamps (200-3000 μmol m -2 s -1 ) filtered through a water-cooled glass container (Gong and Ohad, 1991). Chloramphenicol (200 μg ml -1 D-threo form, Sigma) was added to prevent chloroplast protein synthesis and D1 protein replacement (Schuster et al., 1988). The rate of the D1 protein degradation is not affected by chloramphenicol in Chlamydomonas (Schuster et al., 1988; Zer et al., 1994).Thermoluminescence MeasurementsThermoluminescence was measured using a home-made, computer-controlled apparatus (Zer et al., 1994). Excitation was provided by continuous illumination (up to 250 μmol m -2 s -1 ) or short (3 μs) light flashes delivered by a xenon discharge lamp (0.3 joules/flash) placed 1 cm above the sample. The light emitted due to charge recombination was measured by photon counting.Flash-induced Degradation of the D1 and D2 ProteinsCell suspensions as above were incubated in complete darkness in a covered glass Petri dish mounted on an aluminum plate maintained at temperatures as indicated, by water circulation. The cell suspension (0.5 cm depth) was stirred by a magnetic bar. The cells were first dark-adapted for 5 min and then exposed to short duration light flashes (about 6 μs for 66% discharge) delivered by an EG& FE-132 xenon arc lamp connected to a 2.6-microfarad capacitor charged at 1.5 kV and placed 3 cm above the cell suspension, which was protected from UV light by a broad band pass filter (380 nm to 620 nm transmission). The cell suspension was exposed to 960-1440 series of single or multiple flashes (up to 6 in a series, spaced at 300-ms intervals within a multiple flash series). Dark periods equivalent to or longer than the t ½ of the charge recombination time for the QB - /S2,3 states were interspersed between the light flash series as indicated in the legends to figures. At the end of the flashing regime (4-8 h), the cells were rapidly cooled in ice and thylakoid membranes were prepared as described below. As a control for each experiment, similar cell suspensions were incubated at the same temperature in the dark or exposed to continuous white fluorescent light (low light, 25 μmol m -2 s -1 , optical path, 2 cm) for the same time duration.Assay of D1 and D2 ProteinsThylakoid membranes were prepared as described previously (Gong and Ohad, 1991), and all steps were carried out in the cold. The cells were washed by centrifugation in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM NaCl. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of the same buffer and broken by passing through an ice-cooled French pressure cell operated at 5000 p.s.i. The homogenate was diluted 10-fold in the same buffer, and cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 2000 × g. Thylakoid-enriched membrane fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and were either used immediately or stored at −80°C until use. The D1 and D2 proteins were detected and quantified by immunoblotting using 125 I-protein A as described by Schuster et al. (1988). Monospecific antibodies against the D2 protein were kindly donated by R. Berzborn (Geiger et al., 1987), and those against the D1 protein were prepared by overexpressing the corresponding gene using a plasmid kindly donated by J. Barber as described by Adir and Ohad(1988). Thylakoid membrane samples on equal chlorophyll content basis were loaded on the gels. The membrane proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (Laemmli, 1970) and were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose paper. The transfer efficiency was assayed by Ponceau red staining of the paper and was found to be linear with the amount of protein in a range equivalent with 0.5-1.5 μg of Chl. The autoradiograms were exposed for various times to obtain a linear response of the photographic film and were quantified by computer-programmed densitometric scanning using NIH Image programs.RESULTSDegradation of the RCII-D1 Protein as a Function of Light IntensityThe D1 protein degradation in Chlamydomonas cells incubated in presence of chloramphenicol was linear with time for a period of up to 4 h for PFDs from 10 to 2000 μmol m -2 s -1 (data not shown). Linearity of D1 protein degradation with time for similar duration at high light intensity has been demonstrated in vivo in other organisms (N. Ohad et al., 1990a; Schnettger et al., 1994). The remaining amounts of D1 protein after 4 h of exposure of Chlamydomonas cells to various light intensities are shown in Fig. 1. Degradation of D1 protein was detected in cells exposed to all light intensities. The degradation increases with increasing light intensity. No significant degradation was observed for the D2 protein in cells exposed to the low range of light intensities (data not shown). However, degradation of the D2 protein in Chlamydomonas occurs at high light intensities, although at rates significantly lower than that of the D1 protein (Schuster et al., 1988).Densitometric measurements of the residual D1 protein level in thylakoids of cells exposed to increasing light intensities show a non-linear increase in the degradation with increase in light intensity (Fig. 2A). Only a small additional loss of D1 protein was observed in cells exposed to a light intensity of 3000 μmol m -2 s -1 as compared to 2000 μmol m -2 s -1 . This could be partially due to the saturation of the degradation system activity (N. Ohad et al., 1990a; Sundby et al., 1993).Figure 2:Apparent quantum yield of D1 protein degradation at different light intensities. A, degradation of the D1 protein as a function of light intensity. Densitometric quantification, average of several independent electrophoretic separations, and immunoblotting of samples from the experiments presented in Fig. 1 have been used to calculate the remaining amount of D1 protein in cells exposed to different light intensities for 4 h. B, relation between the ratio of D1 protein degraded/incident light intensity as a function of light intensity (apparent quantum yield); insets, expanded scale to show the effect at low PFDs. Data are normalized to the D1 protein level before onset of exposure to various light intensities (0). Arrow (A) indicates the light intensity at which electron flow measured as oxygen evolution was saturated under the experimental conditions used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When the efficiency of D1 degradation relative to the light intensity was plotted against light intensity using the above data (Fig. 2B), it became obvious that low light is highly efficient in inducing D1 protein degradation. The apparent quantum yield, defined as D1 protein degradation/incident light intensity plotted against the light intensity, shows an unexpected steep decline with increasing light intensity. The apparent quantum yield is 5-7-fold higher at low light intensity supporting less than 5% of the light saturated electron flow rate as compared with that observed at light intensities severalfold higher than that required for electron flow saturation (Fig. 2B).Low Light Intensity Induces Relatively High Levels of QB - in VivoThe photoinactivation and irreversible damage preceding the degradation of the RCII-D1 protein is ascribed to generation of harmful cation or anion radicals within RCII (Prasil et al., 1992; Aro et al., 1993). However, in low light-exposed cells only QB - and the oxidative S1 to S3 states of RCII can be assumed to persist for a long time relative to the lifetimes of the other intermediate steps in RCII electron flow (Vass et al., 1981; Rutherford, 1989; Rutherford et al., 1982; Ohad et al., 1988). At light intensities saturating electron flow, the relative steady state level of QB - should reach a maximum of 50% and a high probability exists for its further reduction to QB 2- , protonation to PQH2 and exchange with a PQ molecule from the plastoquinone pool (forward electron flow). The relation between the forward and back electron flow within RCII are schematically represented in Fig. 3. At low light intensities the probability of an RCII in the QB - state to be excited a second time before charge recombination with the S2,3 states by back electron flow is expected to be significantly lower as compared to light intensities saturating electron flow. Under such conditions charge recombination and possible harmful effects related to this process may prevail relative to forward electron flow. The question thus arises as to whether the relative steady state level of RCII-QB - at low light intensities correlates with observed degradation of D1 protein.Figure 3:Schematic representation of the S states and QB reduction cycle as a function of consecutive light excitations of RCII. Following light excitation by consecutive absorption of photons, QB, the secondary RCII-quinone acceptor, is reduced to QB- while the water splitting manganese complex (“S”) is oxidized (S0 to S4). QB2- is protonated and exchanged with plastoquinone from the PQ pool (SView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thermoluminescence measurements of the RCII-QB - levels as a function of light intensity in cells illuminated for 30 s and thus reaching a steady state level of electron flow are shown in Fig. 4A. A high relative level of QB - is induced at light intensities much below saturation of photosynthetic electron flow. The apparent quantum yield of RCII-QB - accumulation (Fig. 4B) shows a transient increase occurring at a light intensity in the range of 0.5-1% of that at which QB - reaches the maximal steady state level (Fig. 4B, arrow). In this range of light intensity, it is probable that the dissipation of the QB - state occurs primarily by charge recombination. At light intensities approaching saturation of electron flow and beyond, a drastic decrease of the apparent quantum yield of QB - steady state level is evident, compatible with increase in the forward electron flow relative to the back reaction. Since it has been reported previously (Greenberg et al., 1989) that the D1 protein is degraded in Spirodela plants exposed to low light of different wavelengths, it was of interest to test whether low intensity light of different qualities may induce accumulation of high levels of QB - as well. The steady state level of QB - was thus determined as described above also in cell suspensions exposed to light of various wavelengths. The results of such experiments are included in Fig. 4 and show that blue, green, and red light induce levels of QB - comparable to those induced by similar low intensities of white light.Figure 4:Steady state level of QB - (A) and apparent quantum yield of its formation (B) at various light intensities. Chlamydomonas cell suspensions containing 60 μg of Chl ml -1 were layered over a thin disc of lens cleaning paper (Kodak) mounted on the thermoluminescence measuring stage (2 cm diameter). The paper was used to ensure equal spreading of the cell suspension (suspension depth, 1 mm). The cells were dark-adapted for 2 min and then exposed to continuous illumination at light intensities as indicated for 30 s at 6°C. The cells were then immediately frozen, and the relative QB - content of the sample was assayed by photon counting of the thermoluminescence emission. Illumination was provided by a projector delivering 250 μmol m -2 s -1 of unfiltered light. Attenuation of light intensity to the desired levels was achieved by appropriate neutral density filters. The TL signal intensity obtained from a similar cell suspension dark-adapted for 3 min, then frozen in the dark and illuminated at −20°C for another 30 s (white light, 100 μmol m -2 s -1 ) was taken as 100%. Open symbols, unfiltered light; closed symbols, light filtered through interference filters (20-nm half-bandwidth) as follows: square, 430 nm; circle, 490 nm; diamond, 560 nm; star, 604 nm; triangle, 640 nm. Arrow, light intensity at which the level of QB - reaches the steady state level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Correlation between the QB - Level Induced by Series of Single Light Flashes and the Degradation of D1 Protein in VivoThe information so far obtained indicates that a significant level of RCII in the QB - state which may recombine with the S2,3 states can be accumulated in vivo in low light-exposed cells. QB - may also be transiently accumulated in dark-incubated cells exposed to series of single saturating light flashes given at time intervals sufficiently long (seconds) to allow its decay by charge recombination. The flash discharge must be of sufficient short duration (<10 μs) to avoid two consecutive charge separation events in the same RCII and thus minimize further reduction of QB - to plastoquinol. To test whether a correlation can be found between formation of QB - and degradation of the D1 protein, cells were incubated in the dark at 25°C and exposed to 1440 series of 1 flash given at time intervals of 10 s, thus allowing decay of the QB - by charge recombination. Chloramphenicol was added to prevent de novo synthesis of D1 protein. As a control cells were exposed for a similar period of time (4 h) to low light (25 μmol m -2 s -1 ) or were incubated in the dark. The remaining amount of the D1 protein was assayed by immunoblotting. The results of such experiments (Fig. 5) show that 1440 flashes induce 30-40% loss of the D1 protein as compared to only about 25% in cells exposed for 4 h to low light as also shown in Fig. 2. Variable loss of D1 protein ( ~ 20%) also occurred in the dark-incubated cells. The degradation of D1 protein induced by series of 1 flash and normalized to the dark control in each experiment (average of five independent experiments) was found to be 24 ± 5% in cells exposed to light flashes as compared to 7 ± 5% in cells incubated in low light (Fig. 5). Thus, a 3-fold higher degradation of the D1 protein is induced in cells in which relatively high amounts of QB - are accumulated following exposure to light flashes that do not result in forward electron flow as compared to cells exposed to continuous low light supporting low rates of photosynthetic electron flow.Figure 5:Induction of D1 protein degradation by series of single light flashes.

If our hypothesis is correct, we would expect that the amount of degraded D1 protein will oscillate in direct relation to the oscillation of the QB - level. To test if such a correlation exists, several factors have to be considered. The steady state level of QB - generated by a given flash regime depends on: 1) the initial QB/QB - ratio, 2) the S state distribution in the RCII population of the sample at the onset of the flashing regime, and 3) the rate of charge recombination, i.e. the lifetime of the QB - and the S2,3 states, which is temperature-dependent. We have thus determined by thermoluminescence measurements (Demeter and Govindjee, 1989) the t ½ values for QB - /S2,3 charge recombination as a function of temperature for the C. reinhardtii cells. The results (Fig. 6) show that the lifetime decreases exponentially with increasing temperature, being in the range of less than 2 s at growth temperature (25°C) and about 35 s at 5°C. For comparison, the t ½ values for the QA - /S2,3 charge recombination measured in presence of the photosystem II inhibitor Diuron to prevent electron transfer from QA - to QB are also given (Fig. 6).Figure 6:Temperature dependence of t ½ for QB - and QA - decay in the dark. Chlamydomonas cell suspensions were placed on the measuring stage of the thermoluminescence apparatus as in Fig. 4 and maintained at temperatures as indicated. The suspensions were dark-adapted for 3 min and then exposed to a single excitation flash. Incubation was continued in the dark for various times as indicated up to 130 s, and then the cells were rapidly frozen and the residual TL signal arising from recombination of QB - /S2,3 states was recorded. The QA - signal was recorded in the presence of 5 μM Diuron added before the dark adaptation. Values of t ½ were calculated using one- and two-exponent fits for QA - and QB - , respectively; vertical lines represent TL emission peak temperature for the recombination of QA - (QA band) and QB - (QB band), respectively (Rutherford et al., 1982). Due to limitations in the cooling rate of the sample holder in our thermoluminescence apparatus, we could not obtain values for the decay of the QA - /S2,3 states level at temperatures above 5°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The relative level of QB - in vivo for a specific flash regime can be simulated on the basis of: 1) a 1/1 ratio of QB - /QB and 1/3 ratio for S0/S1 in dark-adapted thylakoids (Rutherford et al., 1982), as well as in intact cells (Ohad et al., 1988); 2) back reaction (charge recombination) occurring primarily between QB - and the S2 or S3 states (Fig. 3); 3) the fraction of QB - decay by back reaction (recombination) at the time of flashing. As stated above, the level of remaining QB - at the onset of a flash series can be theoretically set by adjusting the temperature of the cell suspension and the"

De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 2Pasternak C. Spudich J.A. Elson E.L.

Although myosin II seems to play similar roles in a variety of cell types, the in vivo mechanisms regulating myosin II assembly and localization during these processes are not well understood in most systems. In the Dictyostelium system, strong evidence now indicates that myosin II heavy chain phosphorylation has a critical role in the control of myosin assembly and localization within cells. Purified myosin II from Dictyostelium can be phosphorylated by endogenous myosin heavy chain (MHC) ( 1The abbreviations used are: MHCmyosin heavy chainMHCKMHC kinasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase pair(s)TES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid.) kinases on target sites near the carboxyl-terminal portion of the myosin tail. Two distinct threonine-specific Dictyostelium MHC kinases (MHCKs) have been purified to homogeneity(6Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Côté G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of purified MHC by either of these enzymes is capable of driving the disassembly of bipolar myosin filaments at physiological salt concentrations. One of these enzymes (MHCK A) has a molecular mass of 130 kDa on SDS gels and is expressed both in growth phase cells and in starved cells that have entered the Dictyostelium developmental pathway(8Medley Q.G. Lee S.F. Cates G.A. Côté G.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115 (abstr.): 29aGoogle Scholar). In vitro target sites for this enzyme have been mapped to threonine residues 1823, 1833, and 2029 of Dictyostelium MHC (9Lück-Vielmetter D. Schleicher M. Grabatin B. Wippler J. Gerisch G.

The second Dictyostelium MHCK has a molecular mass of 84 kDa and is expressed only during development(11Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This enzyme has been recently cloned and, based on sequence homology, seems to be a member of the protein kinase C family(6Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Dictyostelium myosin II by the 84-kDa MHCK promotes filament disassembly in vitro(6Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it is not clear whether the target sites for the 84-kDa MHCK are identical to those for MHCK A. Dictyostelium also seems to contain an MHC kinase that phosphorylates serine residues and may contain additional threonine-specific MHC kinases, but these activities have not been purified(12Maruta H. Baltes W. Dieter P. Marme D. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Kuczmarski E.R. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7292-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Exposure of Dictyostelium cells to chemoattractants or to agents that stimulate receptor capping results in a transient recruitment of myosin II from a soluble pool into the cytoskeleton, suggesting that regulated assembly and disassembly of myosin filaments into the cytoskeleton are important for these processes(14Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 15Berlot C.H. Devreotes P.N. Spudich J.A. J. Biol.

Newell P.C. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 123-129PubMed Google Scholar). MHC phosphorylation on threonine residues has been observed in vivo concomitant with the transient relocalization of myosin II to the cytoskeleton, suggesting that MHC kinases may play a role in redirecting myosin II back to the soluble pool after chemoattractant-stimulated recruitment(15Berlot C.H. Devreotes P.N. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3918-3926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Berlot C.H. Spudich J.A. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1985; 43: 307-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Newell P.C. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 483-490PubMed Google Scholar). In previous work, the target sites for MHCK A (threonine residues 1823, 1833, and 2029 on MHC) were mutated either to alanine, to inhibit phosphorylation, or to aspartic acid, to mimic phosphorylation(14Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Elimination of these MHCK A target sites resulted in gross overassembly of myosin into the cytoskeleton and caused an array of partial defects in myosin-related contractile processes. Conversion of these MHCK A target sites to aspartic acid rendered the myosin incapable of assembling functionally into the cytoskeleton. The phenotypes of the site-directed MHC mutants provide strong support for the idea that MHCK A has a central role in the control of myosin localization in vivo. Biochemical studies on purified MHCK A have shown that the kinase requires autophosphorylation for activity, but have been unable to identify physiologically relevant molecules that may serve to regulate MHCK A activity in vivo(7Côté G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Medley Q.G. Gariepy J. Côté G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To gain further insights into the mechanisms regulating myosin II phosphorylation and localization in vivo, we have isolated and characterized the gene for the 130-kDa MHCK A. The primary sequence reported here demonstrates, surprisingly, that MHCK A does not display any significant homology to the catalytic domains of conventional eukaryotic protein kinases, yet biochemical analysis of the recombinant MHCK A protein verifies the presence of intrinsic protein kinase activity. In addition, MHCK A appears to contain a coiled-coil domain that may function in oligomerization of the kinase and a carboxyl-terminal domain containing WD sequence repeats similar to β-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Monoclonal antibodies were prepared by standard techniques following immunization of mice with native MHCK A, purified as described(7Côté G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hybridomas secreting antibodies against MHCK A were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and subcloned. The antibody designated A1 was purified using protein A-Sepharose from the ascites fluid of mice injected with the corresponding hybridoma line. The other three monoclonal antibodies used in this study (A16, A21, and A22) were derived from hybridoma supernatants. For immunoblot analysis, washed Dictyostelium cells were boiled directly in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Samples were either stained directly with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted to Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.) and probed with monoclonal antibody. Signal was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse antibody and a chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Corp.). The MHCK A gene was cloned from a λ gt11 cDNA expression library made from Dictyostelium RNA (CLONETECH). Standard protocols were used for library plating, screening, and all phage manipulations(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The library was probed with a pool of two monoclonal antibodies (A16 and A21). Positive plaques were observed at ∼ 1/100 the frequency of plaques positive for a myosin heavy chain antiserum that was used as a control. The overall frequency of MHCK A-positive phage in the library was ∼ 1/10,000. Eight clones were picked for further characterization. Three clones were observed to react with only one of the four antibodies (either A1 or A16), one clone reacted with two antibodies (A1 + A22), one clone reacted with three of the antibodies (A1 + A16 + A22), and three of the isolated clones reacted with all four monoclonal antibodies. The cDNA inserts of the clones that reacted with three or less antibodies were determined to be ∼ 1.5 kb or less in size, while the inserts from clones reacting with all four antibodies were 2 kb or larger. These reactivity patterns suggested that each of the four antibodies recognized distinct epitopes and that the smaller inserts observed correspond to partial cDNA products. Inserts from two clones ( λ 3.1 and λ 1.1) that reacted with all four monoclonal antibodies were subcloned into plasmid vectors. Restriction enzyme analysis and subsequent sequence analysis indicated partial overlap between these inserts. The λ 3.1 insert spanned from nucleotides 21 to 2025 (as numbered in Fig. 2), and the λ 1.1 insert spanned from nucleotides 246 to 3465. DNA sequence analysis was performed by constructing nested deletions of each of these inserts from both ends using the Erase-a-Base system (Promega) and sequencing with the Sequenase system (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). All portions of the gene were sequenced at least once on both strands of the gene. Analysis of the compiled sequence indicated a complete 3′-end, but did not reveal an upstream start codon. Following Southern blot analysis, a plasmid library was constructed in ClaI-digested pBR328 from a size-selected portion of a ClaI digest of genomic Ax2 DNA. Colony screens were performed (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with a 5′-probe derived from the λ 3.1 cDNA insert, allowing the isolation of a 1.5-kb ClaI genomic fragment that overlapped the cloned cDNA and contained upstream flanking sequences. Sequence analysis of this clone revealed a putative ATG start codon 21 bases beyond the 5′-end of the λ 3.1 clone. Upstream of this in-phase ATG codon, the sequence becomes extremely AT-rich (83%), a feature diagnostic for noncoding regions in the Dictyostelium genome. Sequence analysis was performed with the Wisconsin GCG package running on a VAX computer. Data base searches with the BLAST program were performed via Internet at the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Institutes of Health. Computer analysis of α-helical coiled-coil potential was performed using an algorithm devised by Lupas et al. ((23Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar); see also (22Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Science. 1994; 263: 488-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)). Agarose gel electrophoresis, blotting to nitrocellulose, and hybridization were performed using standard conditions(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Final filter washes were performed in 1 × SSC + 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 90 min. Genomic DNA was prepared as described previously(24Egelhoff T.T. Brown S.S. Manstein D.J. Spudich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1965-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 μg of genomic DNA was loaded per gel lane. Probes were made using a random primer method following the manufacturer's protocol (Boehringer Mannheim). Probe DNA fragments were isolated as restriction fragments from the cDNA. Probe A corresponds to nucleotides 122-1493 of the sequence as numbered in Fig. 2, probe B corresponds to nucleotides 1493-2025, and probe C corresponds to nucleotides 2765-3465. Purified native MHCK A (7Côté G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 10 μg/ml in 5 mM TES, 0.1 M KCl, 6% glycerol, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, was autophosphorylated for 30 min at 25°C by the addition of 0.1 mM [ γ - 32 P]ATP (0.2 Ci/mmol). Cross-linking was carried out in 0.5 M KCl by the addition of 0.5 mM bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) for 5 min at 25°C. For renaturation of MHCK A purified from Dictyostelium, MHCK A (0.2 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and renatured following incubation in 6 M guanidine HCl as described(25Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The gel was then incubated for 1 h at 25°C with 3 ml of 10 mM TES, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 μM [ γ - 32 P]ATP (0.5 Ci/mmol). Radioactivity was removed by washing in 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. For analysis of recombinant protein, the MHCK A gene was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 from the vector pET21d (Novagen). Following induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, cells were washed and resuspended in 5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, and 40 mM Tris, pH 7.9, and then lysed by sonication. An inclusion body fraction was isolated by centrifugation for 15 min at top speed in a microcentrifuge. Either total bacterial protein lysates or inclusion body pellets were suspended in SDS sample buffer, heated to 100°C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel). For all samples, an amount of material equivalent to 0.1 A600 units of original culture was loaded per lane. The “full-length” MHCK A plasmid construct expresses a fusion protein in which the first seven codons of MHCK A are replaced by four codons from the vector. The truncated MHCK A construct expresses a fusion protein with the same 4 amino-terminal vector amino acids fused to residues 634-1132 of MHCK A, followed by the polyhistidine tag from the pET21d vector. The last 14 codons of the MHCK open reading frame (residues 1133-1146) are absent in both constructs, with amino acid 1132 of MHCK A fused in phase with the polyhistidine tag of pET21d. SDS-PAGE, transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose, and denaturation/renaturation were done as described (26Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation assays were performed by incubating the filter for 30 min in 30 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, and 0.08 μM [ γ - 32 P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) at 23°C. Following the phosphorylation step, the filter was washed in Tris-buffered saline; then with 7 M guanidine, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.25% milk for 2 h; and then with 2 N HCl for 2 h, followed by a brief Tris-buffered saline rinse before being exposed to film. E. coli cells (BL21) expressing either the truncated MHCK A (residues 634-1132) or the full-length MHCK A construct were grown at 22°C for 7 h in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation; washed once in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA; and then resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then lysed by sonication, and a pellet was obtained by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was solubilized in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1.5% Sarkosyl(27Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar); centrifuged to remove insoluble material; and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Phosphorylation reactions contained 5 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 μM [ γ - 32 P]ATP (50 Ci/mmol), and 0.4 mg/ml Dictyostelium myosin(7Côté G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted at room temperature for 15 min, and samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The monoclonal antibodies generated against MHCK A all reacted strongly with both the unphosphorylated and autophosphorylated forms of the purified MHCK, which have SDS-PAGE mobilities of 130 and 140 kDa, respectively(28Medley Q.G. Lee S.F. Côté G.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These antibodies specifically detect bands of 130 and 140 kDa when used to probe total Dictyostelium protein extracts (Fig. 1), which presumably represent the unphosphorylated and autophosphorylated forms of MHCK A in vivo. Four of the monoclonal antibodies were used to isolate the MHCK A gene from a Dictyostelium λ gt11 cDNA expression library as described under “Materials and Methods.” The complete sequence contains a single open reading frame of 1146 codons, encoding a protein with a predicted size of 128.9 kDa (Fig. 2). This closely matches the observed size of native MHCK A (130 kDa by SDS-PAGE). Amino acid sequence analysis of the MHCK A protein isolated from Dictyostelium indicated that the amino terminus of native MHCK A was blocked. Sequencing was therefore performed on purified tryptic peptide fragments of native MHCK A to confirm the identity of the cDNA clone. Five independent peptide sequences were obtained, and all were found to match the predicted translation product of the MHCK A gene (underlineditalic residues in Fig. 2). The MHCK A sequence was used to search the data base of known sequences using the BLAST algorithm. Weak but significant homologies were found in the amino-terminal portion of MHCK A (residues ∼ 100-500) to a variety of α-helical coiled-coil proteins, including myosin II tail domains, tropomyosin, paramyosins, and intermediate filament proteins. The carboxyl-terminal portion of MHCK A (residues ∼ 880-1146) displayed strong similarity to members of the “WD repeat” family of proteins (also known as “WD40” or “-transducin-like proteins”)(29Peitsch M.C. Borner C. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 292-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Both coiled coils and WD motifs have repetitive character, so the MHCK A sequence was analyzed with the Dotplot program of the Wisconsin GCG package to identify regions with repetitive character (Fig. 3). This analysis revealed an amino-terminal region (residues ∼ 100-500) with weak repetitive character that corresponds to the portion of MHCK A bearing similarity to known coiled-coil proteins. The central portion of the MHCK A protein displayed no significant repetitive character (residues ∼ 500-880), while the carboxyl-terminal portion (residues ∼ 880-1146) displayed a distinct 7-fold repeat of the WD or β-transducin-like repeat. We have tentatively designated each of these segments of MHCK A as distinct domains (Fig. 3, bottom), and analysis of each domain is discussed below. Southern blot analysis was performed with DNA probes corresponding to each of the three segments of the gene to establish a restriction site map of the genomic locus and to determine whether the MHCK A gene is single copy or a member of a homologous gene family. Fig. 4A presents the schematic domain assignment of the MHCK A open reading frame aligned with a DNA map indicating the position of the internal HindIII restriction site at nucleotide 1493 and the positions of each of the probes used for Southern blot analysis. Fig. 4B presents a map of the MHCK A locus derived from Southern blot and cDNA sequence analyses indicating the positions of HindIII (H) and XbaI (X) sites. Probes A, B, and C all hybridized to the same genomic DNA XbaI fragment of 8 kb (Fig. 4C, lanes2). In a HindIII digest (lanes1), probe A hybridized to a 5′-HindIII fragment of 11 kb, and probes B and C each hybridized to a 3′-HindIII fragment of 9 kb. In an XbaI + HindIII double digest (lanes3), probe A reacted with a 4-kb 5′-fragment, and probes B and C both reacted with a 4.5-kb 3′-fragment. These digests, as well as several other single and double digest combinations (data not shown), indicate that the MHCK A cDNA corresponds to a single gene that has no detectable introns (small introns of less than ∼ 80 base pairs might not be detected in this analysis). The MHCK A sequence was analyzed for coiled-coil character using a computer algorithm devised by Lupas et al.(23Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) that accurately recognizes known coiled coils in proteins such as myosin as well as short coiled-coil segments such as the “leucine zippers.” The algorithm predicted that large stretches of amino acids within the amino-terminal 500 residues of MHCK A (corresponding to the region displaying weak repetitive character and weak similarity to known coiled-coil proteins) have an almost 100% chance of forming a coiled-coil structure (Fig. 5a). Proteins with coiled-coil domains are classically found to be assembled in their native state into dimers, trimers, or tetramers. Chemical cross-linking studies were therefore performed with purified MHCK A to assess whether native MHCK A has an oligomeric structure. MHCK A autophosphorylated in the presence of [ γ 32 P-]ATP was used for these experiments to allow cross-linked products to be visualized with high sensitivity by autoradiography. Parallel cross-linking of Dictyostelium myosin II was performed as a control. Prior to cross-linking, MHC migrated on SDS gels with a mobility corresponding to that of a monomer (240 kDa), while after cross-linking, it electrophoresed with a much lower mobility, presumably corresponding to the molecular mass of an MHC dimer (Fig. 5b, lanes1 and 2). A dramatic shift in mobility was also observed for MHCK A following cross-linking. Prior to cross-linking, MHCK A migrated at a molecular mass corresponding to 130 kDa (lane3), but after cross-linking, MHCK migrated with a much lower mobility (lane4), suggesting the formation of either a trimer or tetramer. These results are consistent with the formation of a coiled-coil domain by the amino-terminal portion of MHCK A. This prediction is also in agreement with earlier observations that showed that the 130-kDa MHCK A elutes from gel filtration columns with an apparent molecular mass of >700 kDa(7Côté G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The central portion of MHCK A (residues ∼ 500-880) is nonrepetitive in character and seems to be the most likely portion of the protein to contain the kinase catalytic functions. Surprisingly, computer data base searches using the BLAST algorithm failed to detect any homology between this region and members of the conserved family of eukaryotic protein kinases(31Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 32Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The large majority of known eukaryotic protein kinases belong to this conserved family and display blocks of similarity to each other in ∼ 11 different subregions(33Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 429-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In direct examination by eye, a possible nucleotide-binding motif (GXGXXG) was observed at position 778 (subregion I of the conventional protein kinase family; (31Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar)), and candidate residues for an invariant lysine (subregion II) are present at position 795 or 808. A candidate for a conserved glutamate (subregion III) is present at position 834. Beyond this limited similarity, however, no significant similarity to known kinase domains could be identified by eye, by analysis with the BLAST data base search algorithm, or by direct line-up using Bestfit or Dotplot analysis against known protein kinases. Another MHCK A feature suggesting significant divergence from (or unrelatedness to) the conventional family of eukaryotic protein kinases is the position of the identified GXGXXG motif relative to the G β -like domain. The G β -like domain of MHCK A begins at approximately residue 880, only 100 residues past the GXGXXG sequence. This contrasts with the large majority of currently characterized eukaryotic protein kinase catalytic domains, which all contain at least 200 or more amino acids of conserved sequence with functional importance on the carboxyl-terminal side of the GXGXXG nucleotide-binding site(31Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 33Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 429-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Although native MHCK A from Dictyostelium has been extensively characterized biochemically(7Côté G.P. Bukiejko U. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Medley Q.G. Gariepy J. Côté G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), additional tests were performed to ensure that the MHCK A gene does encode a protein with bona fide kinase activity. To rule out the possibility that a minor contaminant might be responsible for the protein kinase activity in preparations of MHCK A, protein kinase reactions were carried out after gel electrophoresis of purified MHCK A, removal of SDS, and renaturation of the polypeptide in the gel(25Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2032719252,"In this report we test the hypothesis that a cis-acting methylation center can induce epigenetic gene inactivation. The cis-acting element used is an 838-base pair fragment that was shown previously to provide a de novo methylation signal (Mummaneni, P., Bishop, P. L., and Turker, M. S.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 552-558). Its normal location is approximately 1.3 kilobase pairs upstream of the mouse aprt (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase) gene. To determine if the methylation center could induce inactivation of the aprt gene, a plasmid construct was created in which the methylation center was moved next to the aprt promoter. Transfection experiments demonstrated inactivation of the aprt gene on the hybrid construct. The inactivation event was shown with a Southern blot analysis to correlate with hypermethylation and to be reversible by treatment with 2-deoxy-5′-azacytidine, a demethylating agent. Interestingly, gene inactivation induced by the methylation center required truncation of the aprt promoter. The results demonstrate that epigenetic gene inactivation can be induced by a DNA methylation center. In this report we test the hypothesis that a cis-acting methylation center can induce epigenetic gene inactivation.

De novo DNA methylation in mammalian cells is a developmentally controlled process that is involved in X chromosome inactivation (1Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland _1993: 358-384Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and genomic imprinting(2Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Promoter region methylation is associated with transcriptional inactivation of both unique (3Razin A. Cedar H.

High levels of aberrant DNA methylation have been reported in human cancers for autosomal regions that contain tumor suppressor genes (5Baylin S.B. Makos M. Wu J. Yen R.W. deBustros A. Vertino P.

Aberrant methylation of the fmr-1 gene has been demonstrated in the fragile X syndrome(8Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Scott C.R. Chen S.-H. Laird C.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The signals for de novo methylation in mammalian cells have not been identified(9Bestor T. J. NIH Res. 1993; 5: 57-60Google Scholar). One hypothesis is that this event occurs by default throughout most of the genome with specific protection of CpG-rich sequences known as CpG islands(10Kafri T. Ariel M. Brandeis M. Shemer R. Urven L. McCarrey J. Cedar H. Razin A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The promoter regions of many mammalian genes are CpG islands, and a sequence that can protect CpG islands from de novo methylation has been reported(11Szyf M. Tanigawa G. McCarthy Jr., P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An alternative, though not exclusive, hypothesis is that de novo methylation can be signaled by cis-acting methylation centers (12Szyf M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 69: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Such centers have been described recently in regions upstream of the mouse aprt (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase) gene (13Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol.Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the rat αfetoprotein gene(14Hasse A. Schulz W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1821-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation of a CpG site in exon 7 of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has also been attributed to a cis-acting sequence(15Magewu A.N. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4225-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although specific functions have not been ascribed to methylation centers, they clearly represent DNA regions that have a higher probability for being methylated than neighboring DNA regions. Moreover, methylation of linked DNA fragments can be dependent upon the presence of a methylation center(13Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol.Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hasse A. Schulz W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1821-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Magewu A.N. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4225-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that the mouse aprt gene will inactivate spontaneously in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells via an epigenetic event associated with hypermethylation of the CpG-rich promoter region(16Cooper G.E. Khattar N.H. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This is a low frequency event that occurs approximately in one cell in a million. We have also reported that a cis-acting methylation center is located upstream of the mouse aprt gene and that it accounts for a specific methylation pattern that is found in this region(13Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol.Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The location of a methylation center approximately 1.3 kbp 1The abbreviations used are: kbpkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)MCmethylation center5aCdr2-deoxy-5′-azacytidine. upstream of the mouse aprt gene led us to hypothesize that this cis-acting element is responsible for the aberrant inactivation event. In this report we test a plasmid construct, in which the methylation center fragment is juxtaposed with the aprt promoter, for epigenetic gene inactivation. Gene inactivation associated with hypermethylation was found to occur when the plasmid construct was stably transfected into the P19 embryonal carcinoma cell line. kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) methylation center 2-deoxy-5′-azacytidine. An 838-bp fragment separating the H1a and H1 HpaII/MspI sites in the pSam6.3 plasmid (see Fig. 1) was isolated with an MspI digest. Based on work from a previous study, this fragment is termed a methylation center (MC)(13Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol.Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After filling in the ends of the MC fragment with Klenow enzyme, the fragment was ligated into the SmaI site of the pGem7Z vector (Promega, Madison, WI) multicloning site region to create a plasmid termed pGem7Z-MC. This process converted the H1a and H1 sites to SmaI sites, which contain within them HpaII/MspI sites. To reclone the MC fragment (see below), it was removed from the pGem7Z-MC plasmid with an XhoI and HindIII digest (these restriction sites bracket the SmaI site) and filled in with Klenow enzyme. In a separate set of plasmid constructions, a 1.7-kbp EcoRI/HindIII fragment was removed from the pSam3.1 plasmid (Fig. 1) and cloned into compatible EcoRI and HindIII sites in the multicloning site region of pGem7Z. Unidirectional deletions of 664 and 751 bp were made beginning from the EcoRI site of the 1.7-kbp insert with the Erase-a-Base kit (Promega). The blunt end-prepared MC fragment (see above) was cloned into these deletion constructs to create preliminary versions of 664MC and 751MC (see Fig. 2). DNA sequencing was used to confirm the correct orientation of the MC fragment. Next, a 1.3-kbp HindIII fragment containing exons 3-5 of the aprt gene (Fig. 1) was cloned into the preliminary versions of 664MC and 751MC to restore the aprt gene coding region. These final versions of 664MC and 751MC are shown in Fig. 2. Finally, the MC fragments were removed from the 664MC and 751MC constructs to create the 664 and 751 constructs, respectively (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Deletion constructs used in this study. The methods used to make these constructs are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The large closed boxes represent the aprt gene exons, and the open box represents the MC fragment. The small closed boxes represent the Sp1 binding sites that comprise the aprt promoter. These binding sites are not drawn to scale. The M1 fragment was isolated from pSam3.1 with an EcoRI/MspI digest as shown in Fig. 1. The bubble figures represent some of the HpaII/MspI sites found on the constructs (see Fig. 1 for sites that are not shown). The restriction site shown (P) is PstI.

Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1991; 17: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The plasmid constructs were linearized with ScaI prior to transfection. A single ScaI site is present in the vector DNA. The recipient cell line used for these experiments, DelTG3, was derived from the P19 embryonal carcinoma cell line. The DelTG3 cell line lacks both aprt alleles and their respective upstream regions. The Southern blot analysis was performed as described previously(18Turker M.S. Swisshelm K. Smith A.C. Martin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11632-11636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The copy number of integrated constructs for each cell line was determined by digesting genomic DNA with HindIII and blot hybridizing to the pSam3.1 insert. With this method, each integrated construct yields a 1.3-kbp hybridization band representing the fragment separating the two HindIII sites in the constructs used (Fig. 1) and a second hybridization band of variable size representing the region upstream of the intronic HindIII site. Each independently integrated construct gives a single variable hybridization band allowing a determination of the number of integrants/transfectant (i.e. copy number). These procedures were performed as described previously(19Turker M.S. Smith A.C. Martin G.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1984; 10: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The sequence for the region upstream of the mouse aprt gene has the accession number l15342. To determine if the MC fragment could induce gene inactivation, the 664MC and 751MC constructs were made (Fig. 2). The 664MC construct contains the MC fragment positioned 5′ to the four Sp1 binding sites that comprise the aprt promoter. In the 751MC construct, two Sp1 binding sites were deleted, and the MC fragment was inserted 5′ to the two remaining Sp1 binding sites. It has been shown by others that deletion of the two 5′ Sp1 binding sites does not affect aprt expression(20Dush M.K. Briggs M.R. Royce M.E. Schaff D.A. Khan S.A. Tischfield J.A. Sambrook P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8509-8524Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The MC fragments were then removed from 664MC and 751MC to create 664 and 751, respectively (Fig. 2). The ability of each of the four constructs to express the aprt gene was tested by transfecting them into the DelTG3 cells and selecting for stable aprt expression with medium containing azaserine and adenine (AzA medium)(19Turker M.S. Smith A.C. Martin G.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1984; 10: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 demonstrates little difference in the transfection efficiencies for the 664, 664MC, and 751 constructs; a reduction of approximately 20% was observed for the 751 construct. In contrast, a reduction in the transfection efficiency of approximately 4-fold was found for the 751MC construct as compared with the 751 construct. This difference in transfection efficiencies for the 751 and 751MC constructs was observed consistently in a total of seven paired tests (p value = 0.0002). The significant reduction in transfection efficiency for the 751MC construct suggested that it was frequently inactivated when transfected into the DelTG3 cells. To determine if the difference in the behavior of the 664MC and 751MC constructs was due to a distance effect, a 91-bp insert was placed into 751MC between the Sp1 binding sites and the methylation center. This insert is the multiple cloning site from the pGem7Z vector used in these experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3 demonstrates that the transfection efficiency for this new construct, termed 751-91-MC (construct not shown), was essentially the same as that seen for 751MC. As an additional control, the MC fragment was replaced by the M1 fragment, which is located at the 5′ end of pSam3.1 (Fig. 1) to create 751M1 (Fig. 2). The transfection efficiency for the 751M1 construct was essentially equal to that observed for the 751 construct (Fig. 3). This result suggests that a DNA fragment taken from the region between the MC fragment and the aprt promoter did not affect expression of the aprt gene. To directly test for inactivation of the 751MC construct in the DelTG3 cells, a second set of transfections was performed in which the 664MC, 751, and 751MC constructs were each co-transfected with the bacterial neo gene. G418-resistant transfectants were isolated and analyzed with a Southern blot analysis to identify those transfectants that had integrated intact copies of the 664MC, 751, or 751MC constructs. The copy number ranged from 1 to 3 integrants/transfectant. As shown in Table 1, 3 of 3 transfectants containing the 664MC construct and 6 of 6 transfectants containing the 751 construct were found to express significant levels of the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme. Identical results were found for the pSam3.1 and pSam6.3 constructs (Fig. 1) when they were co-transfected with the neo gene (data not shown). In contrast, 5 of 7 transfectants containing 1-3 copies of the 751MC construct failed to express a detectable amount of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme. A sixth transfectant, 751MC-119 (Table 1), expressed only a low level of the enzyme. This experiment confirmed that the aprt gene in the 751MC construct was inactivated frequently when transfected into the DelTG3 cells and that inactivation was due to the presence of the MC fragment.Tabled 1 Gene inactivation associated with hypermethylation can be reversed by treating cells with 2-deoxy-5′-azacytidine (5aCdr)(21Jones P.A. Razin A. Cedar H. DNA Methylation: Biochemistry and Biological Significance. Springer Verlag New York Inc., New York1984: 165-187Crossref Google Scholar). In previous work we have shown that 5aCdr caused high frequency reactivation of the endogenous mouse aprt gene when it was hypermethylated. A nonexpressed aprt allele that was not hypermethylated was unaffected by the 5aCdr treatment(22Cooper G.E. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine if inactivation of the transfected 751MC construct was associated with hypermethylation, two of the 751MC transfectants containing nonexpressed constructs were treated with 5aCdr and analyzed for reacquisition of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase expression by monitoring [3H]adenine incorporation with autoradiography. Table 2 demonstrates that approximately 40-50% of the treated cells incorporated [3H]adenine as compared with 0% of the untreated cells. In an attempt to isolate cells containing a reactivated 751MC construct for further analysis, 5aCdr-treated cells were plated in the presence of AzA medium. It was possible to expand AzA-selected clones from the 5aCdr-treated 751MC-302 transfectant for further analysis. The adenine phosphoribosyltransferase specific activities for two of these reactivants, 751MC-302-R2 and -R4, are shown in Table 1. Autoradiography showed that all 751MC-302-R4 cells had incorporated [3H]adenine (Table 2).Tabled 1 To confirm hypermethylation of the inactive 751MC construct in transfectants at the molecular level, a Southern blot analysis was performed on DNA preparations isolated from some of the transfected cell lines listed in Table 1. The DNA preparations were digested with HpaII and PstI. One PstI site is located in the aprt gene, and a second site is located in the MC fragment (Fig. 2). These PstI sites are separated by a distance of 2.1 kbp on the 751MC construct. A 120-bp CpG island fragment (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, M3), which separates the H3 and H4 HpaII/MspI sites, was used as the probe. Fig. 4 shows that DNA preparations from transfectants expressing aprt initially (751-12, 751MC-105) and those reactivated with 5aCdr (751MC-302-R2 and -R4) were unmethylated at the H3 and H4 sites. This was shown by the presence of a 120-bp hybridization band in the HpaII digestion lanes and the absence of additional hybridization bands. In contrast, the 120-bp hybridization band was markedly reduced in the DNA preparations from nonexpressing 751MC transfectants (751MC-301 and −302), and strong hybridization bands of 2.1 and 1.8 kbp were noted. These hybridization bands were also noted in the DNA preparation from the 751MC-119 cell line, but in this case the hybridization signals were weak. The 2.1-kbp hybridization band results from methylation of the H1-H11 HpaII sites, and the 1.8-kbp hybridization band results from methylation of the H1-H9 HpaII/MspI sites (Fig. 2). As a control, a DNA preparation from the D3 cell line was examined (Fig. 4). The D3 cell line contains a single inactive copy of the endogenous aprt gene(22Cooper G.E. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The 3.3-kbp hybridization band observed for this cell line represents methylation of the H1-H11 HpaII/MspI sites for the endogenous aprt gene (Fig. 1). The 1.8-kbp hybridization band contains methylated H1-H6 or H7 HpaII/MspI sites. We have demonstrated that a cis-acting methylation center can induce inactivation of a linked mammalian gene (i.e. aprt) that contains a CpG-rich promoter. To the best of our knowledge this is the first such demonstration, and it provides a model for epigenetic gene inactivation associated with de novo DNA methylation. We expected the mouse aprt gene promoter to be sensitive to methylation-associated gene inactivation because the endogenous gene can inactivate spontaneously in an event associated with hypermethylation(16Cooper G.E. Khattar N.H. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the aprt promoter is comprised solely of Sp1 binding sites, which are not inhibited by DNA methylation in vitro(23Harrington M. Jones P.A. Imagawa M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2066-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), in vivo footprinting has shown that Sp1 binding does not occur at the four Sp1 binding sites in the D3 cell line(24Turker M.S. Mummaneni P. Cooper G.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). This cell line contains a hypermethylated aprt gene (Fig. 4). The lack of Sp1 binding to the aprt promoter in the D3 cell line suggests that methylation of the promoter region, rather than the Sp1 binding sites themselves, is responsible for the inactivation events, perhaps through alteration of the chromatin structure. We note that the aprt promoter region in the D3 cells is in a closed chromatin conformation(22Cooper G.E. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Important additional experiments will be to compare and contrast the ability of the methylation center used in this study to inactivate methylation-sensitive and -insensitive promoters(25Boyce J. Bird A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). It will also be important to determine why the inactivation event was blocked when the intact aprt promoter (i.e. with four Sp1 binding sites) was present. The possibility that inactivation of the 664MC construct does not occur because the methylation center is positioned 87 bp from the two Sp1 binding sites found in the 751MC construct appears unlikely. This statement is based on the observation that a 91-bp insert placed between the methylation center and the two Sp1 binding sites in the 751MC construct did not increase the transfection efficiency (Fig. 3). Therefore, the additional 87-bp fragment that is present in 664MC may block the inactivation event in a sequence-specific fashion. This fragment contains the two 5′ Sp1 binding sites. We speculate that the presence of four Sp1 binding sites is necessary to block gene inactivation even though only two of these sites are required for high level gene expression. If so, the aprt promoter may have evolved to contain four Sp1 binding sites as a mechanism to block the effect of the upstream methylation center. Consistent with this notion are recent reports that Sp1 binding sites in both the mouse (26Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and hamster (27Brandeis M. Frank D. Keshet I. Siegried Z. Mendelsohn M. Nemes A. Temper V. Razin A. Cedar H. Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) aprt gene promoters are capable of blocking methylation of their respective CpG islands. The approximate location of the mouse aprt CpG island can be seen in Fig. 1 as a cluster of HpaII/MspI sites (H3-H8). We note that in previous work we were able to methylate these sites by moving the CpG island into the methylation center region(13Mummaneni P. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. J. Biol.Chem. 1993; 268: 552-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case only a single Sp1 binding site remained attached to the CpG island. The work presented here has shown that the presence of two Sp1 binding sites is also insufficient to block the methylation signal indicating that at least three Sp1 binding sites are necessary. Such a result was shown by Macleod et al.(26Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), although they did not consider a nonconsensus Sp1 binding site that was also on the fragment they tested. This is the 5′-most Sp1 binding site shown in Fig. 2 for the 664 and 664MC constructs. We consider this as an Sp1 binding site in our analysis based on in vitro(20Dush M.K. Briggs M.R. Royce M.E. Schaff D.A. Khan S.A. Tischfield J.A. Sambrook P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8509-8524Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and in vivo(24Turker M.S. Mummaneni P. Cooper G.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) footprinting data. The latter data, however, indicate that it is a relatively weak binding site. Whether this binding site plays a role in blocking the methylation signal remains to be determined, although it clearly cannot block the signal on its own(26Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2282-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that juxtaposition of a mammalian methylation center with a CpG-rich gene promoter can induce epigenetic gene inactivation. This result offers a potential molecular explanation for physiological and/or aberrant epigenetic gene inactivation in mammalian cells. The ability to induce epigenetic gene inactivation intracellularly at a very high frequency by providing a cis-acting methylation signal may provide a convenient system to study methylation-associated inactivation for a variety of mammalian genes.

https://openalex.org/W2001101609,"The kinetics of unfolding and refolding of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII) and its catalysis by the peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase cyclophilin were investigated. HCAII contains 15 trans- and 2 cis-prolyl peptide bonds, and, when long-term denatured, virtually all unfolded molecules contain non-native prolyl isomers. In unfolding these molecules (Us) are produced slowly in a biphasic process reflecting the isomerization of several trans-prolines and of one cis-proline. In refolding, the rapid formation of an intermediate of the molten globule type is followed by several slow prolyl isomerizations, which determine the rate of reactivation. By a short 10-s incubation in 5.0 M guanidinium chloride at 2°C, unfolded HCAII species with all prolines still in the native conformation (Uf) could be produced. Surprisingly, only a fraction of Uf refolds rapidly, but the other molecules refold slowly. Evidently, some prolyl peptide bonds isomerize early in refolding, at the stage of the molten globule and as a consequence, molecules with incorrect prolyl isomers are formed in competition with the productive folding of Uf. This fraction of slow-folding molecules is strongly increased when cyclophilin is present, because it accelerates the formation of non-native prolyl isomers as long as the molecules remain in the molten globule state. Later cyclophilin catalyzes the isomerization of these prolyl peptide bonds toward the native state, which are stabilized in their conformation by further folding to the native state. This catalysis is very efficient, because only prolines that are accessible in the molten globule are involved in this sequence of isomerization and reisomerization. The kinetics of unfolding and refolding of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII) and its catalysis by the peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerase cyclophilin were investigated. HCAII contains 15 trans- and 2 cis-prolyl peptide bonds, and, when long-term denatured, virtually all unfolded molecules contain non-native prolyl isomers. In unfolding these molecules (Us) are produced slowly in a biphasic process reflecting the isomerization of several trans-prolines and of one cis-proline. In refolding, the rapid formation of an intermediate of the molten globule type is followed by several slow prolyl isomerizations, which determine the rate of reactivation.

This catalysis is very efficient, because only prolines that are accessible in the molten globule are involved in this sequence of isomerization and reisomerization. cis/trans-isomerizations of prolyl peptide bonds are slow reactions, and redundant they determine the rate of the in vitro folding of many proteins(1Schmid F.X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases (EC 5.2.1.8) catalyze these isomerizations in small peptides (2Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim.

Two structurally unrelated classes of peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases have been characterized: the cyclophilins 1The abbreviations used are: cyclophilinrecombinant human cytosolic cyclophilin with a molecular mass of about 18 kDaHCAIIrecombinant human carbonic anhydrase IIBCAbovine carbonic anhydrase BGdmHClguanidinium hydrochloride. and the FK506 binding proteins. They bind tightly to the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506, respectively, and this binding inhibits the isomerase activities of both peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases. In vivo inhibition of cyclophilin by cyclosporin A prevents the folding and secretion of transferrin (6Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol.

Recently, a third class of small peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases, the parvulins, was discovered(11Rahfeld J.-U. Schierhorn A. Mann K. Fischer G.

The efficiency as a catalyst of in vitro protein folding varies strongly, depending on the nature of the peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases and on the properties of the refolding protein(5Schönbrunner E.R.

For folding of several proteins a catalysis could not be detected, even though refolding is limited in rate by prolyl isomerizations. Often, a partially ordered structure forms very rapidly during refolding and decreases the accessibility of the prolyl peptide bonds for peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases(3Lang K. Schmid F.X.

Human carbonic anhydrase II (HCAII) refolds in two stages. Intermediates of the molten globule type are formed rapidly in the first stage, followed by slow reactions, which determine the overall rate of refolding. These slow reactions show properties of prolyl isomerizations and are accelerated by peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases(16Fransson C. Freskgård P.-O. Herbertsson H. Johansson Å. Jonasson P.

Svensson M. Carlsson U. Science. 1992; 258: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) suggested that cytosolic porcine kidney cyclophilin 18 exerted a dual function as a peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases and as a chaperone in the refolding of HCAII. A reinvestigation of the refolding of HCAII indicated, however, that the observed effects of cyclophilin can be explained solely by its peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases activity and that it is not necessary to postulate a chaperone function for peptidyl-prolyl-cis/trans-isomerases(18Kern G. Kern D. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It was our aim here to elucidate the relationship between the rapid formation of the molten globule in the folding of HCAII and the subsequent slow prolyl isomerizations, as well as the catalysis of these steps by cyclophilin. The formation of the early folding intermediates was detected by circular dichroism, and the slow, rate-limiting steps of folding were followed by the regain of HCAII activity. We performed two different types of unfolding/refolding experiments. 2To facilitate reading we used the expressions “non-native prolines” for the isomeric conformation of the prolyl peptide bonds, different from the conformation in the native structure and “native prolines” for the isomeric conformation of the prolyl peptide bonds as present in the native structure; “Uf” for the HCAII molecules containing only native prolines and “Us” for HCAII molecules with prolyl peptide bonds in their thermodynamic cis/trans-equilibrium; “proline limited folding” for folding steps that are limited in rate by prolyl cis/trans-isomerization; “short-term denatured” HCAII for HCAII denatured in 5 M GdmHCl, 10 s at 2°C and “long-term denatured” HCAII for HCAII denatured in 5 M GdmHCl, 1 h at 20°C. In the first experiments the protein was initially unfolded for 1 h at 20°C to produce Us molecules with prolyl peptide bonds in thermodynamic cis/trans-equilibrium and then their role in refolding and in catalysis by cyclophilin were studied. In a second set of experiments the initial unfolding step was shortened to 10 s at 2°C to produce Uf molecules, which had not yet undergone prolyl isomerizations. Their refolding was also measured and compared with the folding of the Us molecules. Finally the duration of unfolding in the first step was varied, and the kinetics of interconversion between Uf and Us in the unfolded protein were followed by the decrease in the amplitude of the fast reaction in the refolding step. HCAII was a gift from Dr. Uno Carlsson (Linköping University, Sweden). The molecular mass of 29,097 ± 4 Da was determined by mass spectrometry and sequencing of the N terminus delivered the sequence AHWGYGKHN. Cyclophilin was kindly provided by Dr. Kurt Lang, Boehringer Mannheim (Penzberg, Germany). Guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmHCl) and Tris buffer, ultra pure, were purchased from Schwarz/Mann. 4-Nitrophenyl acetate was from Sigma and was recrystallized from anhydrous diethyl ether to a constant melting point of 79-80°C. All other chemicals used were analytical-grade. The concentration of HCAII was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of ε280 = 8730 M-1 cm-1(19Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). HCAII (17 μM) was denatured in 5.0 M GdmHCl, 0.1 M Tris/H2SO4, pH 7.5, for 1 h at 20°C to produce long-term denatured protein. Short-term denatured HCAII was produced by incubation in the same buffer at 2°C for 10 s. Reactivation was started by rapid 17-fold dilution with 0.1 M Tris/H2SO4, pH 7.5, 20°C to a final HCAII concentration of 1 μM. For rapid mixing the reactivation solution containing the respective cyclophilin concentration was quickly injected into the solution of the denatured protein. Reactivation kinetics and yields were determined following the esterase activity of HCAII toward 4-nitrophenyl acetate by the continuous as well as by the discontinuous assay method. The experimental data were fitted using the software Sigma Plot from Jandel Scientific (Erkrath, Germany). CD measurements were performed in a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter in a thermostatted cuvette holder using 0.1-cm quartz cells. For calibration an aqueous 1 mg/ml d-camphor-10 sulfonic acid solution (20Cassim J.Y. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) was used. The molar ellipticity was calculated for the mean residue molecular weight in HCAII. For kinetic measurements, all solutions, vials, and pipette tips were thermostatted at 10°C. Mixing was performed in an Eppendorf vial before the mixed solution was transferred to the cuvette. The time required for the overall process was 15 s. All activity measurements were performed as described by Kern et al.(18Kern G. Kern D. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To determine the decrease of Uf molecules as a function of denaturation time at 2°C, renaturation was initiated by rapid dilution with Tris buffer, pH 7.5, at 20°C after various incubation times. The amount of Uf molecules produced during the denaturation was determined by extrapolation of the slow reaction in the resulting reactivation curves to 0-s reactivation. Reactivation was followed using the discontinuous method. To characterize the folding and isomerization reactions of HCAII we unfolded the native protein first by dilution to final conditions of 5.0 M GdmHCl in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then refolding was initiated by a second dilution to 0.3 M GdmHCl in the same buffer. The refolding of HCAII was investigated using CD and fluorescence spectroscopy and an improved esterase activity assay(18Kern G. Kern D. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the far UV-CD spectra of fully denatured and native HCAII. In unfolding the changes in the CD signal at 220 nm are rapid and complete within the dead time of manual mixing (15 s) even when unfolding is performed at 2°C (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the loss of ordered structure in the unfolding of HCAII in 5 M GdmHCl is a very rapid reaction and thus much faster than the subsequent prolyl isomerizations in the unfolded protein. In refolding the secondary structure is also regained very rapidly and the CD signal of the native protein at 220 nm is restored completely within less than 15 s (Fig. 1B). A similar result was obtained when refolding was followed by the change in tryptophan fluorescence at 322 nm (λexc = 280 nm). Again the signal of the native protein is regained within less than 15 s (data not shown). In contrast, reactivation of HCAII is very slow, and less than 4% of the activity of the native protein is restored after 15 s of refolding under the same conditions. Apparently, the secondary and part of the tertiary structure of HCAII are formed very rapidly during refolding, and kinetic intermediates of the molten globule type are formed transiently. Such intermediates were also found in the equilibrium unfolding transitions of the human (HCAII) (21Martensson L.-G. Jonsson B.-H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and bovine (BCA) protein(22Ikai A. Tanaka S. Noda H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 190: 39-45Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23McCoy L.F.J. Wong K.-P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3062-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Kutyshenko V.P. Ebert B. Blanck J. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The cis/trans-isomerizations of the incorrect prolines are intrinsically slow reactions and occur at the stage of these largely folded intermediates. They determine the rates of the final steps of folding, which lead to the native, catalytically active protein. For BCA it was shown that these final slow reactions are also accompanied by a change in the CD signal of the aromatic residues, in the accessibility of tryptophan residues to fluorescence quenching, and in the 1H NMR spectra(24Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Kutyshenko V.P. Ebert B. Blanck J. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 25McCoy L.F. Rowe E.S. Wong K.-P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4738-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). CD measurements at 270 nm require protein concentrations higher than 0.1 mg/ml in the refolding experiment. However, at these concentrations HCAII aggregates. To study the role of prolyl isomerizations in the refolding of HCAII and the catalysis by cyclophilin we carried out two different kinds of reactivation experiments. In the first set of experiments, HCAII was incubated in 5.0 M GdmHCl at 20°C for a long time (1 h) to unfold the protein, and, in addition, to let all prolyl isomerizations in the unfolded molecules proceed to equilibrium. This equilibrium mixture of species is called Us. Its refolding was then investigated after a 17-fold dilution to 0.3 M GdmHCl at 20°C in the absence and presence of cyclophilin. In the second set of experiments the protein was exposed only briefly (for 10 s) to 5 M GdmHCl at low temperature (2°C). During this short period of time only the unfolding reaction takes place (cf. Fig. 1), but not the slow prolyl isomerizations, and, as a consequence, unfolded molecules with the native set of prolyl isomers (Uf) are produced by this brief unfolding pulse. Again, after dilution to native solvent conditions, their refolding and the influence of cyclophilin could be examined. As outlined above the equilibrium mixture of unfolded molecules with different prolyl isomers (Us) was produced by unfolding for 1 h, and then reactivation was measured in the absence and presence of 0.25-10 μM cyclophilin (Fig. 2). Under the given conditions about 80% of the original activity was regained after unfolding and refolding. Reactivation followed a complex time course, and, to a first approximation, it could be analyzed as the sum of two exponential functions. In the absence of cyclophilin, apparent rate constants of k2 = 2.2 × 10 -3 s -1 and k3 = 5 × 10 -4 s -1 and fractional amplitudes of A2 = 0.27 and A3 = 0.51 were obtained. In the presence of cyclophilin slow refolding is accelerated (Fig. 2), confirming earlier measurements(16Fransson C. Freskgård P.-O. Herbertsson H. Johansson Å. Jonasson P. Mårtensson L.-G. Svensson M. Jonsson B.-H. Carlsson U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The analysis of the kinetics in the presence of cyclophilin (Fig. 2) suggests that the rate of the slowest phase (k3) seems to be rather unaffected by cyclophilin, it does, however, lose amplitude, and A3 decreases from 0.51 in the absence of cyclophilin to 0.11 in the presence of 10 μM cyclophilin (Table 1). The rate of the faster process (k2) increases moderately with increasing concentration of cyclophilin in a nonlinear fashion, and the amplitude of this reaction grows at the expense of the amplitude of the slowest process. The representation of the experimental reactivation kinetics as a sum of two exponential functions is certainly an oversimplification, and therefore a further analysis of the apparent rate constants and amplitudes is not warranted. HCAII contains 17 prolines and certainly many unfolded species exist, which may differ in the rate of refolding and in the extent of catalysis. An effect of cyclophilin on the apparent amplitudes of refolding was also observed for RNase T1(14Kiefhaber T. Quaas R. Hahn U. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3061-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The kinetic data are summarized in Table 1 and show that the final reactivation yield is unaffected by cyclophilin.Tabled 1 Unfolded molecules of HCAII with the prolyl peptide bonds still in their native conformation (Uf) were produced by a short 10-s unfolding pulse in 5.0 M GdmHCl at 2°C, and their refolding was studied at 20°C. The Uf molecules should not contain incorrect prolyl isomers, and therefore a single rapid reactivation reaction should be observed, which is not affected by cyclophilin. The results in Fig. 3 indicate, however, that the reactivation of Uf molecules in the absence of cyclophilin is clearly a biphasic reaction. Only about 55% of the activity is regained in a rapid reaction with an apparent rate constant of k1 = 7.3 × 10 -2 s -1. This reaction is complete within 45 s, it is not observed in the reactivation of Us molecules (Fig. 2), and is apparently not limited by prolyl isomerizations. The remaining 25% of activity is regained very slowly, with a rate constant (k2 = 10 -3 s -1) similar to the rates of slow refolding of the long-term unfolded protein (cf. Fig. 2 and Table 1). Apparently, 25-45% of molecules with incorrect prolyl isomers are present in this experiment and give rise to this slow reaction. These molecules could have been already formed during the 10-s unfolding pulse by some unusually rapid prolyl isomerizations, or, else, early in refolding at the stage of the molten globule intermediate by prolyl isomerizations that compete with refolding of Uf after the jump from 5.0 M GdmHCl, 2°C, to 0.3 M GdmHCl, 20°C. These two alternatives can be tested experimentally. If the Us species are formed in the unfolding step already, then their concentration should be insensitive to changes in the refolding conditions. If, however, Us is formed early in refolding in a reaction that competes with the reactivation of Uf then the amplitude of the slow reaction should increase when cyclophilin is included in the refolding solution in order to accelerate prolyl isomerization relative to the fast folding of Uf. The reactivation kinetics of Uf are indeed changed dramatically when 1 μM cyclophilin is added to the refolding solution (Fig. 3). Two effects are observed. First, the fast reactivation reaction has virtually disappeared, and second, the slow reactivation reaction is markely accelerated. This result excludes the first and strongly supports the second alternative. The fast reactivation of HCAII and one or more prolyl isomerizations in the molten globular intermediate appear to be similar in rate, and therefore compete with each other. Cyclophilin exerts a dual role in these experiments. Immediately after transfer of the Uf molecules to the refolding conditions it accelerates the formation of molten globular intermediates with incorrect prolyl isomers. Later, in the slow reactivation of these Us molecules cyclophilin then catalyzes the reisomerization of the initially introduced incorrect isomers. The catalyzed slow folding reaction in Fig. 3 can be fitted to a double exponential reaction with rate constants of k2 = 1.2 × 10 -2 s -1 and k3 = 2 × 10 -3 s -1 and fractional amplitudes of A2 = 0.6 and A3 = 0.2. It should be noted that these rates are much higher than those observed for long-term denatured HCAII in the presence of 1 μM cyclophilin (cf. Table 1). To further elucidate the effect of cyclophilin on the refolding of the Uf molecules, the cyclophilin concentration in the reactivation buffer was varied from 0 to 5 μM. A striking result was obtained when the amount of protein reactivated after 30 s was plotted as a function of cyclophilin concentration (Fig. 4). It decreased dramatically from about 50% in the absence of cyclophilin to a minimum of about 20% near 1 μM cyclophilin and then increased again to about 37% at 5 μM cyclophilin. This profile confirms the dual role of cyclophilin in the folding of Uf molecules. Obviously cyclophilin catalyzes the isomerizations that lead from Uf to Us early in refolding with very high efficiency and therefore the extent of reactivation decreases strongly between 0 and 1 μM cyclophilin. Above about 1 μM cyclophilin almost all Uf molecules are converted to Us and thus cannot refold rapidly. Prolyl isomerizations become rate-limiting for the reactivation of apparently all molecules and are catalyzed by cyclophilin as well. This explains why the extent of reactivation after 30 s increases again, when the concentration of cyclophilin is further increased. Us molecules that were produced from Uf early in refolding at the stage of the molten globule differ strongly from Us molecules that were produced by a long-term incubation under denaturing conditions with respect to the catalysis of reactivation by cyclophilin (Fig. 5). For long-term denatured HCAII, catalysis is rather poor and a nonlinear dependence of the apparent rate constant k2 on cyclophilin concentration is observed. In the refolding of Us molecules that were produced from Uf during refolding, catalysis by cyclophilin is much more efficient and k2 depends almost linearly on cyclophilin concentration. 5 μM cyclophilin increases k2 of long-term unfolded Us 2.4-fold, but k2 of Us which is produced from Uf 30-fold. To analyze the kinetics of the isomerizations that occur in unfolded HCAII and lead to the disappearance of the Uf species, we also performed double-mixing experiments. In the first step the protein was kept under unfolding conditions of 5 M GdmHCl at 2°C for a variable period of time. Then, in the second step, samples were transferred to refolding conditions of 0.3 M GdmHCl, 20°C, and the amplitude of the resulting fast refolding reaction was determined. The decrease of this amplitude with increasing duration of unfolding is shown in Fig. 6. Complex kinetics were observed, which could be approximated by the sum of 2 first-order reactions with rate constants of k1 = 1.1 × 10 -2 s -1 and k2 = 8.3 × 10 -4 s -1 and amplitudes of A1 = 0.26 and A2 = 0.23. HCAII unfolds very rapidly in the presence of high concentrations of GdmHCl even at low temperature. Therefore two different collections of unfolded molecules (Uf and Us) could be produced by varying the duration of unfolding. After a short 10-s unfolding pulse at 2°C, HCAII is completely unfolded, but the native-like isomeric states of the prolyl peptide bonds are still retained, i.e. Uf molecules with correct prolines are populated. After 1 h of unfolding at 20°C, cis/trans-equilibria are reached at all 17 prolines in the unfolded protein, and a heterogeneous mixture of polypeptide chains with incorrect prolyl isomers, Us, is formed. The refolding of both Uf and Us starts with the rapid formation (k1 > 0.33 s -1) of a compact molten globule-like intermediate, which already displays a native-like secondary structure. Such an intermediate was also observed in the refolding of bovine carbonic anhydrase B(22Ikai A. Tanaka S. Noda H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 190: 39-45Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23McCoy L.F.J. Wong K.-P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3062-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25McCoy L.F. Rowe E.S. Wong K.-P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4738-4743Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Schmid F.X. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4764-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The formation of the molten globule is then followed for both Uf and Us by rate-limiting folding reactions which control the regain of the enzymatic activity of HCAII. The reactivation of the Us molecules is a slow and complex multi-exponential process. It is accelerated by cyclophilin, but the efficiency of catalysis is fairly poor. We suggest that all slow steps in the refolding of HCAII are limited in rate by prolyl isomerizations. The complexity of the process is not surprising, since HCAII contains 17 proline residues. A fraction of these prolines are presumably trapped in the interior of the protein by the formation of the molten globule and thus not readily accessible for cyclophilin. The kinetics of reactivation of the Uf molecules with native prolyl isomers are also complex. In addition to a fast reaction, slow, proline-limited steps were also observed. They do not originate from Us species that were already produced in the 10-s unfolding pulse, but they were formed after the transfer of the protein to refolding conditions at the stage of the molten-globule intermediate. Prolyl cis/trans-isomerizations continue to occur and compete with the rate-limiting steps of folding. Indeed, the reactivation of the Uf molecules (k1 = 7.3 × 10 -2 s -1) and prolyl isomerization (10 -2-10 -3 s -1) show similar rates at 20°C, and the fast reactivation reaction could be suppressed efficiently when the competing prolyl isomerizations were accelerated by cyclophilin. Interestingly, the Us molecules that are produced by catalyzed prolyl isomerization early in refolding are different from the Us molecules that were produced by long-term unfolding. Their reactivation is slightly faster and is catalyzed with much higher efficiency by cyclophilin. When the Us molecules were produced by long-term unfolding, then 5 μM cyclophilin increased the major folding reaction about 2.4-fold. When the Us molecules were produced early in refolding, however, the major refolding reaction was increased about 30-fold. This indicates that different sets of prolines isomerize under unfolding conditions and early in refolding in the presence of cyclophilin. The molten globule is formed very rapidly during refolding, and possibly only the exposed prolines are isomerized rapidly by cyclophilin in this partially folded intermediate. These prolines remain accessible in the course of further folding and, as a consequence, their isomerizations toward the native conformation are also well catalyzed. When Us is produced under unfolding conditions, some incorrect prolines are buried rapidly in the molten globule and thus not readily accessible for catalysis during refolding. After unfolding the Uf species decreases in a complex reaction as shown in the double jump experiments in Fig. 6. This is not surprising, regarding the high number of proline residues in HCAII. To a first approximation the Uf species decrease in two reactions with apparent rate constants (kapp) of about 10-2 s-1 and 10-3 s-1 at 2°C. Prolyl isomerizations of single prolines in oligopeptides and in unfolded proteins often show apparent rate constants of equilibration near 10-3 s-1 at 0°C(26Schmid F.X. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4764-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 27Grathwohl C. Wüthrich K. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 2623-2633Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 28Kelly R.F. Stellwagen E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5095-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Kiefhaber T. Quaas R. Hahn U. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3053-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The faster reaction (kapp = 10-2 s-1) in unfolded HCAII could result from an anomalously rapid isomerization. Alternatively, it could be caused by the high number of trans-prolines in the protein, which, in the unfolded molecules, can isomerize independently of each other in parallel reactions. Thus Uf would decrease with an overall rate that is equal to the sum of the individual isomerizations. Since the correct trans-state is strongly favored in the unfolded protein chains as well, the individual isomerizations have very small amplitudes and in total give rise to a reaction that comprises only a fraction of all unfolded molecules. In addition, two cis-prolines are present in native HCAII. One of them (Pro-202) was shown to be non-essential for refolding(16Fransson C. Freskgård P.-O. Herbertsson H. Johansson Å. Jonasson P. Mårtensson L.-G. Svensson M. Jonsson B.-H. Carlsson U. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and therefore we speculate that the isomerization of the other cis-proline (Pro-30) could be involved in the formation of the Us species. The non-native trans-isomer of Pro-30 is strongly favored in the unfolded protein, and therefore Uf further decreases in a slow reaction in the double jump experiments. The observed biphasic kinetics for the decrease of Uf in Fig. 6 can be reproduced well in a model calculation by assuming that 10 trans-prolines and a single cis-proline isomerize with rate constants of 10-3 s-1 each to cis/trans-equilibria of about 0.1. These model calculations do, of course, not exclude other possible explanations for the results in Fig. 6. They indicate, however, that at least a part of the trans-prolines and one of the cis-prolines are important in the folding of HCAII. In addition to barnase(30Matouschek A. Kellis J.J. Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), iso-2-cytochrome c(15Veeraraghavan S. Nall B.T.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10428-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), and procollagen(32Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17144-17148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HCAII is another candidate where cis → trans-isomerization appears to be rate-limiting for refolding. Several conclusions can be drawn with regard to the mechanism of folding of HCAII, the mechanism of folding in general and the function of cyclophilin as a catalyst of folding. The unfolded state of HCAII is strongly heterogeneous and most if not all molecules contain non-native cis- and/or trans-prolyl isomers. In refolding these molecules can rapidly adopt the molten globule state, irrespective of the presence of incorrect prolyl peptide bonds. Some of them may be located in the interior, others at the surface of the molten globule. A molten globule with incorrect prolyl isomers was suggested to exist also for bovine carbonic anhydrase B(22Ikai A. Tanaka S. Noda H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 190: 39-45Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23McCoy L.F.J. Wong K.-P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3062-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Kutyshenko V.P. Ebert B. Blanck J. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Most of the exposed and possibly also some of the buried prolines are located in flexible regions of the protein. Cyclophilin catalyzes efficiently the equilibration of these prolines in the molten globule state with native isomers, which is formed rapidly in the folding of Uf. Evidently the structure of the molten globule is not specific enough to stabilize, and thus select the native-like isomeric states. They are only fixed in the final slow steps of folding, which are thus coupled with and limited in rate by prolyl isomerization. Generally, when the direct refolding reaction of Uf species Uf → N and the isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds Uf ⇋ Us proceed with similar rates, the two processes compete with each other and the prolyl cis/trans-equilibrium is in part re-established. This was also noted in the refolding of other proteins near the transition region and used to test the mechanism of folding(33Mücke M. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7848-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This competition can be very efficient when multiple prolyl isomerizations lead away from Uf. Cyclophilin acts as a classical enzyme in the catalysis of protein folding. In the folding of HCAII it catalyzes isomerizations of both cis- and trans-prolines, and the direction of the reaction is determined only by the stability of the isomeric state of each proline in the native protein. When the native prolines are not yet stabilized (as in the molten globule), then a rapid cis/trans-equilibration of accessible prolyl peptide bonds is catalyzed by cyclophilin. Intermediates of the molten globule type are substrates for cyclophilin. This may be relevant for de novo folding, because newly made polypeptide chains may collapse rapidly to a compact state similar to the molten globule early in cellular folding. The rapid formation of such ordered structure interferes, however, with the catalysis of isomerization of interior prolines. This is another indication that rapid formation of stable structure is not necessarily of advantage for efficient folding.

Two of the outer domains are ~ 10 kDa lipoyl domains, an NH2-terminal one, E2L1 , and, after the first hinge region a second one, E2L2 . The pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase binds tightly to the lipoyl domain region of the oligomeric E2 core and phosphorylates and inactivates the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. We wished to determine whether lipoyl domain constructs prepared by recombinant techniques from a cDNA for human E2 could bind the bovine E1 kinase and, that being the case, to pursue which lipoyl domain the kinase binds. We also wished to gain insights into how a molecule of kinase tightly bound to the E2 core can rapidly phosphorylate 20-30 molecules of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component which are also bound to an outer domain of the E2 core. We prepared recombinant constructs consisting of the entire lipoyl domain region or the individual lipoyl domains with or without the intervening hinge region.

E2L2 but not E2L1 increased the activity of resolved kinase by up to 43%. We conclude that the kinase selectively binds to the inner lipoyl domain of E2 subunits and that this association involves its lipoyl prosthetic group. We further suggest that transfer of tightly bound kinase between E2L2 domains occurs by a direct interchange mechanism without formation of free kinase (model presented).

Four of these components execute the overall reaction through a series of steps linked by cofactor-mediated active site coupling: E1, the pyruvate dehydrogenase component; E2, the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase component; E3, the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase component; and protein X, the E3 binding component(1Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 3Reed L.J. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like E2 subunits, protein X contains a lipoyl domain, and its prosthetic group participates in the middle 3 of the 5 step reaction series catalyzed by PDC. Control of the PDC reaction is critically important for regulating cellular fuel utilization, and PDC activity is controlled primarily by a highly regulated phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. This regulatory cycle is carried out by dedicated kinase and phosphatase components that operate to reduce and increase the activity of the complex through phosphorylating and dephosphorylating, respectively, the E1 component.The E2 component has a central role both in the organization of the complex and in supporting the function of the kinase and the phosphatase(1Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 4Roche T.E. Rahmatullah M. Li L. Radke G.A. Chang C.L. Powers-Greenwood S.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mammalian PDC•E2 subunits are highly segmented structures with seven structural regions consisting of four globular domains connected by three extended linker or hinge regions (1Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 2Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8501-8512Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 3Reed L.J. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sixty of E2′s COOH-terminal domain assemble to form a dodecahedron shaped inner core structure that is surrounded by the remaining three globular domains flexibly connected by the three hinge regions. Along with other components and considerations, the domain structure of E2 is modeled in Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:. At the NH2-terminal end of E2, there are two ~ 10-kDa lipoyl domains, E2L1 and E2L2 connected by a ~ 30 amino acid linker or hinge region (H1). In all α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes, one or more lipoyl domain of the E2 component functions in ferrying the intermediate forms of their pendant lipoyl group between active sites. The mobile hinge regions allow a single lipoyl domain to visit not only different active sites but to be available to several equivalent active sites at least in the case of the E1 and E2 components(3Reed L.J. Hackert M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining globular domain, in the exterior region of the mammalian E2 oligomer, functions in the binding of the E1 component (5Rahmatullah M. Gopalakrishnan S. Andrews P.C. Chang C.L. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2221-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rahmatullah M. Radke G.A. Andrews P.C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14512-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is designated the E2B domain. This small ( ~ 46 amino acid) domain is flanked on its NH2-terminal side by a relatively large, ~ 36 amino acid, hinge region (H2), that connects it to the E2L2 domain and on its COOH-terminal side by a ~ 20 amino acid hinge region that connects it and the entire flexible, exterior structure to the oligomer-forming inner domain of E2. The inner domain of E2 also catalyzes the acetyltransferase reaction.Figure 5:Model of the domains of an E2 subunit binding an αβ unit of the E1 component by its B domain and a kinase subunit by its L2 domain. In the upper section the model depicts hinge connected L1 and L2 domains with attached lipoyl groups. A major portion of L2 and the inner of its lipoyl-lysine side chain are positioned under (dashed lines) and interacting with a kinase subunit (K). The β subunit of E1 interacts with the B domain of E2 and the α subunit of E1 is positioned to serve as a substrate for the kinase subunit. To emphasize the oligomer forming role of the inner (I) domain of E2 a second I domain is included but without outer domains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In typical preparations of bovine PDC, 20-30 α2β2E1 tetramers and as few as one molecule of kinase are bound to the E260 core. Though very tightly bound to E2 the kinase can efficiently inactivate the complex (kcat = 0.5 s -1 ). Indeed, the phosphorylation of free E1 by free kinase is severalfold slower than when these components are bound to the E2 core. We wish to identify the specific domain of E2 that functions in the binding of the kinase and to gain insights into how this organized state of the complex greatly enhances the activity of the E1a kinase. The dissociation of E1 from the E2 core is slow(7Brandt D.R. Roche T.E. Pratt M.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 8Behal R.H. Browning K.S. Hall T.B. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8732-8736Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the kinase has an even tighter affinity for the E2 core(9Ono K. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. Rahmatullah M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26135-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In early work to address this question of how an E2-bound kinase molecule rapidly phosphorylates many E2-bound E1 tetramers, studies were conducted with very dilute complex which led to a major portion of the E1 but little kinase dissociating from the E2 core. It was found that the few bound E1 were rapidly phosphorylated (and PDC activity lost) and, moreover, that phosphorylation of free E1 tetramers occurred at a rate that corresponded to that estimated for the rate of association of free E1 with the E2 core(10Brandt D.R. Roche T.E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2966-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Only with the knowledge of E2′s structure and characterization of the location and nature of kinase binding to the E2 can the underlying mechanisms be evaluated.The E1a kinase has been shown to bind to the lipoyl domain region of E2 in bovine PDC(6Rahmatullah M. Radke G.A. Andrews P.C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14512-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ono K. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. Rahmatullah M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 1245-1251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selective removal of the lipoyl prosthetic group was shown to lead to dissociation of the kinase demonstrating an essential role of this cofactor in tight binding of the kinase(12Radke G.A. Ono K. Ravindran S. Roche T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 982-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the kinase binds very tightly to the oligomeric E2 core, it was found to efficiently transfer to a fragment of bovine E2 that contained both lipoyl domains(9Ono K. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. Rahmatullah M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26135-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have suggested that transfer involves a direct interchange of the kinase (i.e. without any free kinase) between the exterior lipoyl domain regions of the E2 core(9Ono K. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. Rahmatullah M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26135-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such movement at the surface of the assembled E2 core would explain how a kinase molecule is able to both bind tightly to E2 core and still phosphorylate 20-30 E1 tetramers that are also bound to the E2B domain at the surface of the E2 core.The kinase is composed of two subunits. One has been identified as a catalytic subunit(13Stepp L.R. Pettit F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we have designated it as Kc; the other subunit was considered to be a noncatalytic subunit(13Stepp L.R. Pettit F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rahmatullah M. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10265-10271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been designated Kb by this laboratory. 2This subunit was very difficult to detect following two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focussing followed by SDS-PAGE(21Suzuki K. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 4021-4025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in a heavy overloading of resolved kinase, we detected a smeared band that was more basic than other components at the position this subunit moved in SDS-PAGE. This was the basis of the b designation. This subunit's sequence indicates it is not particularly basic(16Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basis for this discrepancy remains to be determined. The amino acid sequence of the catalytic subunit of the rat heart pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase was recently determined from its full-length cDNA(15Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An exciting conclusion was that the Kc subunit is a relative of the bacterial histidine kinase family. Recently, Popov et al.(16Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have cloned and expressed the second kinase subunit of rat heart PDC. They demonstrated that it has a distinct subunit but related sequence to the Kc subunit and that it was catalytically active although with a lower specific activity than that of the Kc subunit. The latter observation needs to be reconciled with not losing kinase activity upon cleaving this second subunit(11Rahmatullah M. Gopalakrishnan S. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1245-1251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stepp L.R. Pettit F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we will now change our designation of the kinase subunits and refer to Kc as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and to the other kinase subunit as pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2). In the case of complexes and subcomplexes containing both, we will reduce this to K1 and K2 for the sake of clarity, e.g.E2-X-K1K2 subcomplex. PDK2 is present in bovine preparations of bovine complex at variable levels and often decreases in resolution processes that first leave the kinase bound to E2 core and then involve removal of the kinase from the E2 core (e.g. 9, 17). The severalfold activation of the kinase occurs upon its binding to the assembled E2 core, and this only requires PDK1(17Li L. Radke G.A. Ono K. Roche T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). No known functions of the kinase are lost when PDK2 is proteolized (11Rahmatullah M. Gopalakrishnan S. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1245-1251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stepp L.R. Pettit F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 10265-10271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or at very low levels in kinase preparations.Recently, we have prepared a variety of constructs of the lipoyl domain region of the human PDC-E2. 3Liu, S., Baker, J. C., Andrews, P. C., and Roche, T. E.(1994) Arch. Biochem. Biophys., in press. These were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins attached to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and as free lipoyl domains selectively released from GST by thombin treatment. When expression was performed with lipoate supplementation, the lipoyl domains were fully lipoylated. We have made the individual domains E2L1 and E2L2 and those domains with the connecting H1 hinge region attached, E2L1·H1 and E2H1·L2 , and also made the bilipoyl domain structure, E2L2·H1·L2 . Several E2 subunits of bacterial PDCs contain two or three lipoyl domains; however, no roles have been described that are performed in a specific or even highly preferential manner by one of the lipoyl domains in an E2. We have established that the bovine E1 kinase binds to human lipoyl domains with the L2 domain serving as a highly preferential binding site. We have demonstrated efficient movement of the kinase between the oligomeric E2 core and lipoyl domain constructs containing the L2 domain. Additionally, we have characterized the effects of the individual and bilipoyl domain constructs on kinase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe E2-X-K1K2 subcomplex and resolved E1 component were prepared from purified bovine kidney pyruvate dehydrogenase complex(19Linn T.C.

(Protein X functions as the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) binding component and is also referred to as E3-BP but X is a clearer designation for presentation of a series of components in a subcomplex.) In some cases the resolved E1 was prepared essentially free of kinase and in other cases it contained up to 0.35 nmol min -1 mg -1 kinase activity. This activity was measured without E2 activation of kinase activity and indicates about 0.4% contamination by the kinase. The latter was used as a source of kinase that is completely free of E2 in some studies because its kinase activity was more stable than that of resolved and purified kinase. Resolved, homogeneous kinase was prepared from E2-X-K1K2 subcomplex by lipoamidase treatment followed by sucrose gradient separation and DEAE chomatography. 4J. C. Baker, K. Ono, and T. E.

Microcolumns were made in standard 200-μl polypropylene pipette tips by inserting and compressing ~ 2.5 mm diameter pieces of polyethylene mesh. Equivalent aliquots of GSH-Sepharose were added as a slurry of 50% packed gel in 50 μl total volume of transfer buffer to the microcolumns followed by washing and removal of excess buffer with 5 μl of buffer restored on top of the column. Transfer of kinase from the E2-X-K1K2 subcomplex to GST-lipoyl domain constructs was evaluated by two procedures. In transfer procedure 1, GST-lipoyl domain or GST and the E2-X-K1K2 subcomplex were mixed for a specific time (typically 25 s) in 20 μl of transfer buffer at 30°C. This mixture was then added and rapidly mixed with 25 μl of packed GSH-Sepharose at 23°C using the needle of the microsyringe with which the mixture was added to do the mixing (completed in 5 s). After 30 s, 25 μl of the mixture in the column was passed though by applying mild pressure with a FASTEPPER pipette (Denville Scientific, Inc.) connected to the microcolumn. The column was washed twice with 25 μl of transfer buffer by a sequence of addition, rapid mixing, and immediate elution. The filtrates and wash fractions were pooled together (75 μl of filtrate) and placed on ice prior to determination of kinase activity, E2 activity, and GST activity. The GST construct bound to the GSH-Sepharose was eluted with three 25-μl washes of buffer containing 10 mM GSH. The activities of the kinase, E2, and GST were determined in the combined 75 μl of eluate. GST activity was determined by standard procedures (22Jacoby W.B. Warholine M. Gutherbeig C. Bah C.V. Manerick B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using 4-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as substrate. Other assays are described below.In Transfer Procedure 2, GST-lipoyl domain constructs were pre-loaded onto GSH-Sepharose columns. In some experiments this was preceded by a procedure to delipoylate a portion of the constructs. In that case, 750-pmol samples of GST constructs were incubated with or without 0.35 μg of lipoamidase for 8 h at 30°C. Parallel studies demonstrated the lipoamidase treatment completely removed the capacity of the GST constructs to undergo reductive acetylation, but this could be restored, after phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inactivation of lipoamidase, by treatment with E. coli lipoyl protein ligase to reintroduce lipoyl groups (data not shown). To each tube, 30 μl of GSH-Sepharose pre-equilibrated in transfer buffer was added and incubated 10 min at 23°C followed by quantitative transfer to a microcolumn and washing with 30 bed volumes of transfer buffer and removal all but 5 μl of excess buffer. Then 4 μg of E2-X-K1K2 subcomplex in 20 μl was added for the indicated times (typically 30 or 60 s) followed by elution steps and analyses as described above.Kinase Transfer to Free Lipoyl DomainsTransfer of the kinase from E2-X-K1K2 subcomplex to free lipoyl domain constructs (i.e. free of GST) was evaluated using the sucrose gradient procedure as described by Ono et al.(9Ono K. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. Rahmatullah M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26135-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to separate the subcomplex from the free lipoyl domains. The buffer for all steps was 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2 mM dithiotheitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM MgCl2. The sucrose step gradients were prepared in 5 × 20-mm ultraclear tubes (Beckman) placed in a custom designed Teflon holder at the bottom of buckets of a Sorvall HA629 swinging bucket rotor. The gradient steps consisted of 50 μl each of 7.5, 10, and 15% sucrose (w/v). A 50-μl sample, containing 3 nmol of free lipoyl domain construct, 25 μg of E2-X-K1K2 (366 pmol of E2 subunits, ~ 12 pmol of kinase subunits), and 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, was incubated at 23°C for 30 min and loaded onto the top of the gradient followed by centrifugation a 27,000 rpm, at 20°C for 180 min. After centrifugation, a top fraction of 120 μl, a middle 40 μl, and bottom 40 μl were removed. The pellet was resuspended and dissolved in 40 μl of buffer. Fractions were analyzed for kinase and E2 activity and by SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) followed by silver staining(24Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar).Enzyme AssaysKinase activity was determined in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.1, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiotheitol, 0.1% Pluronic F68, and 0.1% Triton × 100 with other conditions as described previously (9Ono K. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. Rahmatullah M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26135-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). When the effects of lipoyl domain constructs on the activity of resolved or E2-bound kinase were evaluated, preincubation conditions were as described in the figure legends. Each assay contained 25-30 μg of E1 component and the indicated kinase source. In standard assays reaction mixtures were incubated for 2 min at 30°C and then kinase activity initiated by the addition of [ γ - 32 32 P]ATP (100-300 cpm/pmol) to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. Reactions were terminated after 60 s by spotting 40 μl onto dry trichloroacetic acid containing Whatman 3MM paper disc. Discs were then washed as described previously (25Rahmatullah M. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10146-10152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and [ 32 32 P]phosphate incorporation into E1 determined by liquid scintillation counting.The transacetylase activity of E2 was measured by monitoring the increase in acetyl-dihydrolipoamide production by recording the increase in absorbance at 232 nm(9Ono K. Radke G.A. Roche T.E. Rahmatullah M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26135-26143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained in 1-ml cuvette at 30°C: 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 mM dihydrolipoamide, 2 mM acetylphosphate, 5 μM CoA, 50 μM cysteine, and 2 units of phosphotransacetylase. After the 232 absorbance became constant (by 10 s) due to conversion of CoA to acetyl-CoA by the phosphotransacetylase reaction, the E2 source was added and the increase in absorbance with time recorded.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCapacity of Human Constructs to Bind Bovine Pyruvate Dehydrogenase KinaseInitial testing was performed with the bilipoyl domain structure, E2L2·H1·L2 (1-233) to determine whether, like the bilipoyl domain fragment, E2L, derived from bovine E2 subunits, this structure could serve as an acceptor in the transfer of the kinase from the bovine E2-X-K1K2 subcomplex. We also wished to obtain an estimate of the concentration dependence for GST-E2L2·H1·L2 as an acceptor (using GST as a control) and to evaluate E2 recovery and GST removal in the pass-through filtrate. As shown in Table 1, the recovery of kinase activity did not vary significantly with different GST levels. However, when 197 or 295 pmol of GST-E2L2·H1·L2 was incubated with the subcomplex (43.9 pmol of E2 subunits), the kinase activity recovered with the subcomplex was reduced by 46 or 69%, respectively. Nearly all the GST activity was removed by the initial rapid passage through GSH-Sepharose which also allowed, within experimental error, full recovery of E2 activity. Thus, these results supported a rapid transfer of the kinase from the intact protein to the bilipoyl domain structure. Indeed, longer times of incubation of the subcomplex with the GST-E2L2·H1·L2 did not appreciably increase the loss of kinase activity from the subcomplex (below). The results also indicate that competitive transfer of about half the kinase activity from the intact E2 core to the human construct occurs at an even lower ratio of subunit of the GST-bilipoyl domain structure to core E2 subunit ( ~ 5:1) than the ratio when the bovine E2L fragment was used as the acceptor ( ~ 12:1(9Ono K.

We report here that the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor is involved in the regulation of downstream signal transduction. The two receptor isoforms were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Both exogenous receptors underwent autophosphorylation and subsequently stimulated a set of protein tyrosine phosphorylations that were not present in control cells.

The adipocyte particulate fraction (PF) constituted ≈80% of cellular PP-1 activity, while PP-2A was entirely cytosolic. Insulin rapidly stimulated PF PP-1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner (maximum stimulation at 5 min with 4 nM insulin). Immunoprecipitation of PF with an antibody against the site-1 sequence of rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen-associated PP-1 (PP-1G) subunit indicated that ≈40% of adipocyte PP-1 activity was due to PP-1G form of the enzyme. Insulin stimulated PP-1G (120% over basal levels) without affecting the other forms of PP-1 in the PF. Insulin activation of PP-1 was accompanied by >2-fold increase in the phosphorylation state of the 160-kDa regulatory subunit of PP-1. Stimulation of p21 Ras /mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAP) with GTP analogues also resulted in stimulation of PP-1 similar to insulin. The insulin effect on MAP kinase and PP-1 activation was blocked by a GTP antagonist, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate. The inhibitors of MAP kinase activation (viz. cAMP agonists, SpcAMP and ML-9) also blocked PP-1 stimulation by insulin.

To map DNA regions required for the correct regulation of the hCRP gene, several constructs have been generated, and their expression in transgenic mice has been analyzed. Constructs lacking DNA regions surrounding the poly(A) site of the gene are not expressed either before or after induction in transgenic mice. Minimal regions 540 base pairs upstream and 1.2 kilobases downstream of the hCRP gene are sufficient for liver-specific expression. Extended 5′- and 3′-flanking regions are required to silence the expression prior to induction. Our findings demonstrate that regulatory sequences shown to confer inducible expression of the hCRP gene in hepatoma cell lines are insufficient in transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1994701391,"The utilization of dCTP derived from de novo synthesis through ribonucleotide reductase in exponentially growing CCRF-CEM cells was compared with the metabolic fate of dCTP produced by the salvage pathway. Exogenous dCyd was not effectively incorporated into replicating DNA; instead, dCTP derived from ribonucleotide reductase (labeled by [5-3H]Cyd) was the main precursor for that purpose, apparently because of functional compartmentation of the dCTP pool in these cells. Studies of the metabolic route of incorporation of exogenous [5-3H]dCyd into DNA of growing CCRF-CEM cells demonstrated that it was mainly incorporated through the DNA repair pathway. Incorporation of [5-3H]dCyd into DNA of synchronized cell populations was maximal in G1 cells, whereas [3H]dThd incorporation occurred predominantly in S phase cells. When cellular DNA was density labeled by incubation with BrdUrd, repaired DNA, which was less dense than replicated DNA, was preferentially labeled by [5-3H]dCyd. In contrast, replicated DNA was labeled by both [3H]dThd and [5-3H]Cyd. The DNA-damaging agents methylmethanesulfonate, ultraviolet irradiation, and γ
-irradiation inhibited [3H]dThd incorporation, whereas they stimulated the accumulation of [5-3H]dCyd in DNA. Based on these results, we propose that the dCTP pool is functionally compartmentalized in growing CCRF-CEM cells. dCTP derived from the salvage pathway is utilized predominantly for DNA repair, whereas the de novo pathway supplies dCTP for DNA replication."

FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).In most cells, activins/inhibins and TGF-βs bind to distinct sets of receptors. It has been reported that GH3 rat pituitary tumor cells express a single high affinity receptor for both activins/inhibins and TGF-βs(47Cheifetz S. Ling N. Guillemin R. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reflecting the similar physiological effects of these hormones on pituitary cells. This 55-60-kDa surface protein could be affinity-labeled by 125 I-TGF-β1; labeling was inhibited by TGF-β1, TGF-β2, activin-AB, and inhibin-B at concentrations in the high picomolar to low nanomolar range(47Cheifetz S. Ling N. Guillemin R. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, GH3 cells apparently express a novel type of cell-surface TGF-β receptor (type IV) capable of recognizing several members of the TGF-β superfamily.Here we show that GH3 cells express heteromeric type I-type II receptor complexes for the TGF-βs and for activin-A that have been reported in other cultured cell systems. We find no evidence for a type IV receptor. We hypothesize that in GH3 cells the TGF-βs and activins use different receptor complexes to induce similar physiological effects, presumably by activating common downstream intracellular effectors.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureGH3 cells (CCL 81.2: American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, L-glutamine, 10% horse serum, and 5% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.).Generation of Anti-peptide AntibodiesWe have described a polyclonal rabbit antiserum, called α(TGF-βRII), raised against a peptide corresponding to a C-terminal sequence of the human TGF-βRII (49Moustakas A.

Cross-linked proteins were resolved by 5-10% linear gradient SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and autoradiographed on XAR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) at −70°C or on a phosphorimager (Fujix, BAS 2000, Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Japan). To test the sensitivity to the reductant dithiothreitol (DTT) of ligand binding to type I receptors, cells were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C with 1 mM DTT and washed to remove the reducing agent prior to addition of radioligands(49Moustakas A.

Detergent extracts were diluted to 1 ml (final volume) of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were precleared by incubation with preimmune serum followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Then, 10 μg/ml IgG fraction or 10 μl/ml crude sera were added in the absence or presence of an equimolar amount of the respective immunizing peptide. After precipitation with protein A-Sepharose the immunocomplexes were thoroughly washed in immunoprecipitation buffer supplemented with 0.2% SDS, dissolved in Laemmli loading buffer, and subjected to 5-10% linear gradient SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography or phosphorimager analysis. All antibodies specifically precipitated metabolically labeled receptors and affinity-labeled receptors from transfected cells expressing the appropriate recombinant receptor cDNA and from cell lines expressing endogenous receptors 2A.

Primers corresponding to the most conserved amino acid sequences in the kinase domain of the known members of the TGF-β receptor family were used; the sequences of the clones and the details of the reverse transcription-PCR procedures are described in full detail elsewhere(48Takumi T. Lodish H.F. BioTechniques. 1994; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Amplified cDNA products were purified from acrylamide gels and ligated to a pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Random clones were isolated and sequenced using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.).Rapid cDNA Cloning by PCR ScreeningA cDNA library was constructed from GH3 cells as described(25Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The GH3 library was screened as described elsewhere(48Takumi T. Lodish H.F. BioTechniques. 1994; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and single positive clones were obtained. The cDNA sequences were determined as described above.RESULTSCross-linking of 125 I-TGF-β1 to GH3 cells resulted in a single predominant protein species of 70 kDa (Fig. 1, lane2), confirming the result in reference(47Cheifetz S. Ling N. Guillemin R. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the type IV receptor was described. This protein species is equivalent to 57 kDa, the approximate molecular mass of the type I TGF-β and activin receptors, if the molecular mass of the cross-linked monomeric TGF-β1 is subtracted; it has the same size as the cross-linked type I receptors in many other cell lines that express endogenous receptors or transfected recombinant type I receptors. Fig. 1(lane 1) shows that prior treatment of the cells with DTT resulted in partial inhibition of labeling of the 70-kDa species, suggesting that this species might consist of a heterogeneous population of receptors, some of which exhibit the typical DTT sensitivity of TGF-β type I receptors. Importantly, cross-linking of 0.05 nM 125 I-TGF-β1 to the 57-kDa receptor was efficiently competed by a 100-fold excess of unlabeled TGF-β1 (Fig. 1, lane6) and by a 500-fold excess of TGF-β3 (lane 12) but not by a 500-fold excess of TGF-β2 (lane 9) or activin-A (lane15). Thus, this 70-kDa species resembled in its binding properties TGF-β receptors characterized in other cell lines(35ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzén P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 37Inagaki M. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Carr B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22215-22218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to results in (47Cheifetz S. Ling N. Guillemin R. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), up to 25 nM activin-A could not inhibit binding of TGF-β1 (lanes 13-15) or TGF-β2 (data not shown) to this surface receptor.Binding of the TGF-βs to the type I receptor requires co-expression of the type II TGF-β receptor(20Massagué J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 21Lin H.Y. Moustakas A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar), but in GH3 cells affinity-labeling experiments revealed the presence only of type I-like receptors; type II receptors were undetectable (Fig. 1 and (47Cheifetz S. Ling N. Guillemin R. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Type II receptors were visualized by immunoprecipitation analyses of GH3 proteins affinity-labeled with TGF-β1 using specific anti-receptor antisera (Fig. 2). Antibody α(ALK-5), raised against the type I TGF-β receptor, specifically immunoprecipitated both the 70-kDa TGF-β1 and the TGF-β2-affinity-labeled type I receptors together with small amounts of an affinity-labeled protein of the expected size of the type II receptor (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 14). Importantly, antibody α(TGF-βRII), specific for the type II TGF-β receptor, specifically immunoprecipitated the 70-kDa TGF-β1 and the TGF-β2-affinity-labeled type I receptors together with large amounts of the type II receptor (lanes 9 and 16). Immunoprecipitation was inhibited by incubation of the antibodies with their corresponding immunogenic peptide (lanes13 and 15). Neither antibody precipitated receptors affinity-labeled with 125 I-activin-A (lanes4 and 5; see below). Antibodies α(ALK-4) and α(ALK-2) also immunoprecipitated a small amount of the 70-kDa TGF-β1 and TGF-β2-affinity-labeled type I receptors (lanes 6, 7, 10, and 12); this was surprising since ALK-4 and ALK-2 are thought to be type I receptors specific for activin-A. However, TGF-β will bind to these receptors if co-expressed in COS cells with large amounts of the type II TGF-β receptor 3T. Takumi, A. Moustakas, H. Y. Lin and H. F.

Thus, GH3 cells express the conventional type I (ALK-5, ALK-4, and ALK-2) and type II TGF-β receptors.Figure 2:Immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor antibodies of GH3 proteins cross-linked to 125 I-TGF-β1, -β2, and activin-A. GH3 cells were chemically cross-linked to 0.6 nM 125 I-labeled activin-A (lanes 1-5), TGF-β2 (lanes 6-9), or TGF-β1 (lanes 10-16). Detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies α(ALK-2) (lanes 1, 6, and 10), α(ALK-4) (lanes 2, 3, 7, 11, and 12), α(ALK-5) (lanes 4, 8, 13, and 14), or α(TGF-βRII) (lanes5, 9, 15, and 16) alone or in the presence of equimolar amounts of the respective immunogenic peptides (lanes 2 and 11 for α(ALK-4), lane13 for α(ALK-5), and lane15 for α(TGF-βRII)). The resulting immunocomplexes were analyzed by 5-10% SDS-PAGE.

This species migrates slower than the TGF-β1 affinity-labeled type I receptor of 70 kDa (compare lanes 3, 9, and 14 of Fig. 2), and has the molecular size expected for type I activin receptors(16Cárcamo J.

Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Fig. 3(lane 1) shows that labeling of this receptor with 125 I-activin-A was somewhat affected by prior treatment of cells with DTT, similar to results obtained with the TGF-β type I receptor (Fig. 1). Importantly, binding of 0.5 nM 125 I-activin-A to this GH3 cell receptor was inhibited by as little as a 10-fold excess of unlabeled activin-A (lanes 3-6) but not at all by as much as 250 nM (500-fold) of any TGF-β isoform (lanes 7-15). Thus, in contrast to the results in (47Cheifetz S. Ling N. Guillemin R. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GH3 cells express distinct type I receptors for TGF-β and for activin-A. We find no evidence for a receptor that can directly bind to both ligands.Figure 3:Chemical cross-linking of 125 I-activin-A to GH3 cells. Confluent GH3 monolayers were incubated with 0.5 nM 125 I-activin-A alone (lanes 1 and 2) or together with increasing concentrations of unlabeled activin-A (5, 10, 50, and 250 nM in lanes 3-6, respectively), TGF-β1 (10, 50, and 250 nM in lanes 7-9, respectively), TGF-β2 (10, 50, and 250 nM in lanes 10-12, respectively), and TGF-β3 (10, 50, and 250 nM in lanes 13-15, respectively).

Using deletional and site-directed mutagenesis, we previously showed that the carboxyl terminus of human CETP comprises the epitope of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and is necessary for neutral lipid transfer activity. To assess the nature of the involvement of the COOH terminus in cholesteryl ester transfer activity, we characterized a deletion mutant of CETP lacking amino acid residues 470-475 in terms of CE transfer kinetics, association with HDL, and capacity to bind CE, triglyceride (TG), and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Kinetic analysis indicated a major catalytic defect of the deletion mutant, as shown by markedly decreased maximum cholesteryl ester transfer activities (apparent Vmax) for donor (HDL) and acceptor (low density lipoprotein (LDL)) lipoproteins but there were no significant changes of concentrations of the donor and acceptor at 50% Vmax (apparent Km ). The binding of CETP to HDL, as determined by native gel electrophoresis, was similar for wild-type and mutant protein. When egg PC/CE vesicles were incubated with wild type CETP and then separated by gel filtration chromatography, there was maximum binding of about 1 mol of CE/mol of CETP. Under similar conditions the mutant CETP bound 0.09-0.37 mol of CE/mol of protein.

The binding of phosphatidylcholine was similar for wild-type and the deletion mutant.

Approximately 30 labeled bands could be detected after autoradiography of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-separated polypeptides, ranging in molecular mass from 6 to 200 kDa. Methyl iodide hydrolysis resulted in the release of covalently bound farnesol, geranylgeraniol, phytol, and some unidentified isoprenoid compounds from mevalonate-labeled proteins. It was found that all cellular fractions contained some isoprenylated proteins, although most were located in the mitochondria and nuclei. Subfractionation of the nucleus revealed that the majority of isoprenylated proteins in this compartment were components of the nuclear matrix. The results demonstrate that in vivo labeling of a complex organism can be performed using a plant system in order to study protein isoprenylation and distribution of modified proteins in different cellular compartments. Protein isoprenylation in vivo is demonstrated using spinach seedlings labeled with [3H]mevalonate.

https://openalex.org/W2007176904,"Scatter factor/hepatocyte growth factor (SF/HGF) and its receptor c-Met represent a paracrine signaling system involved in mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during development and during tumor progression. We have examined the promoters of the mouse and human SF/HGF genes by deletion mapping followed by CAT assays as well as by gel retardation and footprinting analysis. The promoter sequences are highly conserved (89.5% identity) up to position -453 from the major transcription start site but diverged considerably further upstream. Both promoters are active in mesenchymal but not epithelial cells thus reflecting the expression pattern of the SF/HGF gene in cells in vitro and in vivo. We have here identified two regulatory sequences in the SF/HGF promoter: a negative element at positions -239 to -258 and a positive element near the major transcription start site; specific deletions destroyed the activities of these elements. We were not able to localize elements on the SF/HGF promoter region that mediate the previously described effects of transforming growth factor beta, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and coculture of epithelial cells on SF/HGF gene expression. This study represents a first step toward understanding the intricately regulated and cell type-specific expression of the paracrine acting SF/HGF."

Class A β-lactamases constitute a rich source of information about the relationship between the amino acid sequence and the function of the protein (Ambler et al., 1991). The class A, C, and D β-lactamases represent three large families of active site serine enzymes (Coutere et al., 1992). Several crystallographic structures of class A enzymes are known (Herzberg, 1991; Knox and Moews, 1991; Jelsch et al., 1993). In addition, there is crystallographic work with some mutant variants (Herzberg et al., 1991; Knox et al., 1993), including one trapped in the acyl-enzyme intermediate (Strynadka et al., 1992). Also, there are reports about the structure of trapped intermediates of a class A enzyme in complex with an inhibitor molecule (Chen and Herzberg, 1992) or with a transition state analog (Chen et al., 1993). Because of the extensive use of β-lactam antibiotics, variant enzymes have emerged that are capable of hydrolyzing an extended spectrum of substrates, including third generation cephalosporins (Jacoby and Medeiros, 1991). The understanding of this extended spectrum mechanism is crucial for gaining insight in the design of new and better drugs. However, because only a few previous studies have included biochemical descriptions of the extended spectrum mutant enzymes (Sowek et al., 1991; Huletsky et al., 1993; Lee et al., 1991), more work is needed in order to dissect the individual contributions of the substituted residues present in the variants to the recognition of different substrates. In this work we present data related to determining the contributions of individual residues to the substrate specificity of TEM β-lactamase. We describe a new specificity mutant altered in positions 104 and 238, obtained through random combinatorial mutagenesis and selective approaches, and then we dissect the individual contributions of each residue in order to analyze the role of different parts of the active site in the substrate discrimination process. Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, 6-aminopenicillanic acid, cephaloridine, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime (Fig. 1) were purchased from Sigma. Nitrocefin was a gift from Glaxo. Taq polymerase was purchased from Promega. Polymerase chain reactions were performed in a Biosycler Oven. Restriction enzymes, Klenow fragment and ligase were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Mutant β-lactamases were made using the procedure described in Merino et al.(1992). Mutations were introduced via polymerase chain reaction and sequenced with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The primers used for mutagenesis were synthesized using a strategy similar to that described by Hooft van Huijsduijnen et al.(1992). This consisted in the introduction, via removal and remixing of the solid support, of a 50% wild-type codon and a 50% of a NNG/C mixture representing all 20 amino acids (32 codons). The target codons included positions 104 and 105, and 237, 238, and 240, distributed in two different mutagenic oligonucleotides. N means an equimolar mixture of all four nucleotides and G/C means a mixture with 50% each G and C. The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by a dilution method on Luria broth agar plates at 37°C, with inocula of 30-50 colony-forming units dispensed in 5-μl drops. The plates contained the penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotic at several different concentrations, plus kanamycin at 25 μg/ml. The minimum concentration inhibiting the growth of cells was taken as the minimum inhibitory concentration. The wild-type and mutant enzymes were purified as follows: β-lactamase was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Fresh colonies were inoculated into 6 liters of Luria-Bertani media and grown on a 37°C shaker for 12-14 h. After a cold shock treatment, cell debris was removed by centrifugation (6000 rpm for 10 min) and the cell-free supernatant mixed with of the total volume of 0.02 M sodium acetate, pH 4.8. Some proteins were removed by precipitation by gently swirling on a shaker at 4°C; the precipitate was removed by centrifugation as above, and the supernatant (containing β-lactamase) was batch-loaded onto a CM-Sepharose (CL-6B from Sigma) column previously pre-equilibrated with the same sodium acetate buffer. The nonbound proteins were washed with the same buffer for several hours, and the bound proteins eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.4 M NaCl. Fractions containing β-lactamase activity were pooled and exchanged via ultrafiltration with an Amicon YM10 filter into 0.025 M imidazole buffer, pH 7.0. This protein solution was loaded onto a chromatofocusing column (PBE94 from Pharmacia) using the same buffer as start buffer and eluted with a pH gradient of 7 to 4 using the pH 4 Polybuffer 74-HCl from Pharmacia. Fractions containing β-lactamase activity were pooled and exchanged into 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, by ultrafiltration as above. All proteins were purified to more than 90% homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and isoelectric focusing-PAGE using the Pharmacia PhastSystem. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enzyme activities were determined from complete progress curves, fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using substrate concentrations at least five times the Km. The data were analyzed on a Macintosh computer using the Kaleidagraph program (Abelbeck Software). All points were determined at least in triplicate. With cefuroxime and cefotaxime the catalytic parameters were obtained by initial velocities using 10-15 different substrate concentrations bracketing the Km and the data fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Kaleidagraph program. With some cephalosporin substrates, because the Km was too high, only kcat /Km could be determined using measurements of the first-order rate of hydrolysis under conditions of substrate concentrations much less than Km. Substrate hydrolysis was measured at 30°C with a Perkin-Elmer 320 spectrophotometer according to the method of Waley(1974). The reactions were carried out in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, using 0.1, 0.4, or 1 cm path length cuvette as needed. The wavelengths for monitoring substrates were as follows: 240 nm for penicillins; 300 nm for cephaloridine, 262 nm for cefuroxime, and 282 nm for cefotaxime. The concentration of β-lactamase was determined by using α280 = 29,400 M -1 cm -1 . The active site of the wild-type or mutant TEM β-lactamases, defined by all the amino acid residues and water molecules present within 10 Å radius around the Ser 70 Cα, was optimized by energy minimization using the all-atom consistence valence force field (Biosym) parameters and charges. The initial binding interactions of benzylpenicillin and cefotaxime with the several enzymes were studied by manual docking of the substrate to the active site followed by unconstrained energy minimization of the final complex. The substrates were manually fitted into the active site to position the β-lactam carbonyl oxygen in the oxyanion hole and to maximize hydrogen bonding. The model substrate was adjusted manually to relieve obvious steric problems with the protein. Random combinatorial mutagenesis, using the strategy described by Merino et al.(1992) and selective screening in cefotaxime plates with antibiotic concentration higher than the reported minimum inhibitory concentration, resulted in the double mutant E104M/G238S described in this work. In order to study the individual effect of each mutation against several substrates, we constructed several other mutants in those positions. Using subcloning approaches we separated the double mutant into its individual parts. For comparative purposes we constructed other enzyme variants including the single mutant E104K and the double mutant E104K/G238S. These mutations are present in other broadened specificity mutants that arose in other TEM β-lactamase contexts (Sougakoff et al., 1988). The mutant E104M/G238S, and its single amino acid replacement counterparts E104M and G238S, were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing-PAGE. Mutant enzymes with the G238S alteration were less stable than the others. Because of questions of stability, most studies were performed within a few days of the final purification step. Antibiotic susceptibility testings of E. coli strains (JM101) carrying the plasmid-borne gene for the wild-type and mutant enzymes are shown in Table 1. Minimum inhibitory concentration values indicate that the single variants G238S, E104M, and the double mutants with the change G238S, and Lys or Met in position 104 were the most active against cefotaxime.Tabled 1 The single mutants E104M and G238S, and the double mutant E104M/G238S were chosen for a more detailed study. The kinetic parameters of the wild-type β-lactamase and its mutant derivatives are summarized in Table 2 Table 3 Table 4.Tabled 1Tabled 1 Hydrolysis rate studies for each of these antibiotics with the different enzymes resulted in the kcat values shown in Table 2. The single variant E104M produces an increase in kcat over wild-type values against all the substrates tested, whereas the G238S mutant shows an increase in kcat only for cefotaxime. It is clear from Table 3 that the G238S substitution increased the affinity of the enzyme for a variety of β-lactam substrates, with the exception of cefuroxime and to a lesser extent to cefotaxime. The substitution E104M, on the other hand, had little effect on the affinity for substrates. It is interesting to note that with cefuroxime none of the mutations affected Km, and with cefotaxime the major effect on Km occurred only in the double mutant.Tabled 1 When catalytic efficiencies of the β-lactamases were compared, it became evident that all the mutants were better enzymes against penicillin substrates as compared with cephalosporin substrates (Table 4). However, for the double mutant E104M/G238S, cefotaxime and cephaloridine became better substrates than 6-aminopenicillanic acid. As shown in Table 4, the variant E104M is a better enzyme than the wild-type against all the substrates tested. The modification G238S was detrimental for the catalytic efficiency against all substrates tested except cefotaxime. It is important to note that the double mutant catalytic efficiency against cefotaxime is nearly 1000-fold greater than of the wild type. Our results demonstrate the lack of predictability of a particular mutation on the expected modification of kcat or Km for a particular substrate. For instance, the single mutant G238S shows decreased kcat and improved (decreased) Km against all substrates tested, excepting cefotaxime (for which kcat is increased and Km remains similar to the wild-type value) and cefuroxime (Km remains similar to the wild-type value), whereas the E104M modification increases the kcat value against all substrates tested but had little effect on Km. However, this same alteration, present in the G238S context, caused a significant decrease in Km for some substrates but little effect on others! As shown in Table 5, the calculated interaction distances between the side chains of the enzymes and benzylpenicillin have an excellent correlation with the activity results of the different enzymes against this substrate (Table 2 Table 3 Table 4). The distance between the β-lactam carbonyl carbon atom and the oxygen of Ser 70 for the enzyme mutants E104M and E104M/G238S is almost the same as that calculated for the wild type. These mutants showed a higher kcat value against benzylpenicillin as compared with the single mutant G238S. In the oxyanion hole, the hydrogen bond between the β-lactam carbonyl and the backbone NH237 is stronger than the one with the backbone NH70, a result similar to that obtained by Juteau et al. (1991) when modeling substrate binding by the ROB-1 enzyme. It is clear from the contact distances in Table 5 that the G238S and E104M/G238S mutant enzymes could be less efficient in neutralizing the charge developed in the β-lactam carbonyl than the wild-type and E104M enzymes. This result correlates well with the data of kcat /Km for all the enzymes against benzylpenicillin. Unfortunately, the cefotaxime modeling results showed poorer correlation with the enzyme activity data. All our energy minimized dockings were calculated without modification to atomic charges on substrate or enzyme. It is possible that a more sophisticated modeling approach, taking into account the complex side chain of cefotaxime, and the likely development of partial charges on various enzyme and substrate atoms, may lead to better modeling of the cefotaxime complex.Tabled 1 In a manner similar to Carter et al.(1984), we decided to analyze our results using the mutant cycle displayed in Fig. 2a. If replacement of different side chains induces no structural changes in the enzyme or enzyme-substrate complex their effects will be independent, and the overall change in interaction energy of the enzyme-substrate transition state in double mutants will be the sum of the corresponding terms for the two single mutants. The kinetics of the purified enzymes, with ampicillin as substrate, suggest that the individual mutations are independent (Fig. 2b). Thus, the loss in interaction energy of the double mutant with the transition state is close to the algebraic sum of the free energies of the single mutants. It is interesting to note that the Km value for the double mutant is mostly accounted for by the mutation G238S (Table 3). If Km is a good measure of the affinity for the substrate, then this result suggests that the second alteration E104M has little effect on the conformation of the active site, at least for the interaction with this substrate. In contrast, with cefuroxime as substrate, the catalytic properties of the mutants are accounted for only by the modification E104M (Table 2). When the change G238S is added, in the context of the single mutant E104M, no additional effect is observed (Fig. 2c). Unexpectedly, the favorable effect shown by the E104M single mutant in the wild-type context is even higher when this alteration is added in the G238S context. The gain in interaction energy observed for the double mutant contrasts with the lower value expected from independent single mutants. The analysis of the Km values of the single and double mutants with this substrate reveals that the binding of this substrate with the active site is very similar to that of the wild type. This result is in contrast with the proposed structural effect for the mutation G238S (Huletsky et al., 1993) and observed in this work with the penicillin substrates tested and with cephaloridine. This fact, and others (see below), point to the difficulties in predicting the effect of some mutations on the interaction with different substrates. With other substrates, the analysis of the individual contributions of the single mutants is more complicated. With some substrates (6-aminopenicillanic acid, cephaloridine, and benzylpenicillin), a relatively independent behavior of the single mutations is observed (Fig. 2, d-f). The loss in interaction energy of the double mutant with the transition state deviates little from the value expected from independent effects of each mutation. With benzylpenicillin as a substrate, the results show that there are no effects of adding the modification E104M in the G238S context (Fig. 2f). This result might suggest more severe alterations (as sensed by the substrate benzylpenicillin) of the active site in response to the modification G238S. With all the above substrates, there are additional variations in Km shown by the single mutants as compared with the double mutant (Table 3). With cefotaxime as substrate neither single mutant significantly alters the Km when compared with the reported wild-type value. However, there is a decrease in the Km in the double mutant. The analysis of the individual contributions, using kcat /Km values, shows that the gain in interaction energy of the double mutant is a little more than the value expected from independent mutants (Fig. 2g). It is also clear from Fig. 2g that adding either mutation in the context of the other produces an identical and more favorable improvement in the kcat /Km parameter as compared with the effect of the single mutations in the wild-type context. This seems to indicate some kind of interdependence of both mutations that might explain the small increase in interaction energy shown by the double mutant. Based on the lowered Km for most β-lactams, Huletsky et al.(1993) suggested that the single mutation G238S has a structural role. Our results show a similar trend. However, the present study contributes some significant additional information, namely the G238S mutation does not lower Km against second and third generation cephalosporins as shown by the results obtained with the antibiotics cefuroxime and cefotaxime. Interestingly, the double mutant E104M/G238S also shows a decrease in Km for cefotaxime, in spite of the fact that the single substitutions have no effect on Km. With cefuroxime, the Km of the double mutant is the same as that observed with the single variants. The G238S variant shows drastically reduced kcat values against all substrates tested except cefotaxime, where a distinct increase was observed. With this latter substrate it is clear that the ability of the single mutants to hydrolyze it is due to an improvement in the catalytic parameters, but the combination of both single mutants results in an improvement of the binding parameter as well. The ability to catalyze hydrolysis of the second generation cephalosporin cefuroxime is provided entirely by the modification E104M. In contrast, the change G238S is detrimental in the wild-type context decreasing the kcat and kcat /Km parameters against this same substrate. Strikingly, the single variant E104M and the double mutant show the same improvement in the ability to hydrolyze cefuroxime. The data obtained for the E104M variant are more difficult to interpret in structural terms. Sowek et al.(1991) suggested that the hydrolysis of ceftazidime by the variant E104K could be explained by an interaction between the new positive charge of the Lys 104 and the carboxylate of the aminothiazole oxime side chain of the substrate. However, because the same variant presented an enhanced activity against substrates with no carboxyl group on the side chain, such as cefotaxime, the authors proposed the formation of new favorable hydrogen bond interactions between the side chain of Lys 104 and the substrate side chain. With our variant, because the long hydrophobic side chain of M104 cannot form hydrogen bonds, it is clear that alternative explanations are necessary in order to understand the better hydrolytic capabilities of this mutant with all the substrates tested when compared both with the wild-type enzyme and with the E104K variant (see Table VI of Sowek et al.(1991)). As can be seen in Fig. 3, Glu 104 of TEM β-lactamase (Strynadka et al., 1992; coordinates kindly provided by Dr. M. N. G. James) could be playing a role in the replenishment of the hydrolytic water molecule in a similar way as proposed for Asn 104 in the Bacillus licheniformis β-lactamase (Knox and Moews, 1991). As shown in Fig. 3, Asn 104 may be able to interact with water molecules 565 and 667. Strikingly, the substitution Met for Glu in position 104 produces a better enzyme than the wild type against all substrates tested. This results might suggest a lesser importance of the outer rim in the replenishment mechanism as compared with Asn 132 in the central position of the observed train of water molecules. Alternatively, the substitution E104M could provide a hydrophobic character to the active site making more favorable interactions with the hydrophobic tip of the β-lactam side chain substituent as suggested for the Staphylococcus aureus enzyme (Herzberg and Moult, 1987). The fact that Km is not altered in the interaction of the E104M mutant against all substrates tested suggests that the hydrophobic interactions stabilize preferentially the transition state as compared with the ground state of the substrate. The modeling results of the mutants E104M and E104M/G238S with benzylpenicillin docked in the active site show that the calculated interaction distances between the β-lactam carbonyl carbon atom and the oxygen of Ser 70 and the distances between the β-lactam carbonyl and the oxyanion hole are closer to the calculated wild-type values than those shown by the less active mutant G238S (Table 5). In summary, our results show that the disturbance of a complex set of interactions between different residues and the substrate, probably together with subtle conformational changes, can result in unpredictable specificity alterations. The specificity changes could be the result of the improvement of binding interactions in some regions of the active site (such as the modification G238S) or in the improvement of the transition state stabilization due to alterations in other region of the active site (such as the modification E104M). Our results add to a data base that should prove useful once structural data of these mutants is obtained. This, together with detailed computer simulations may help clarify the molecular basis of β-lactamase substrate interaction.

The kinetic characterization of this mutant indicated relatively small effects compared to the wild-type. Both pK1 and pK2 for catalysis were decreased about 1 unit relative to the pK′s for the wild type. This effect was predominantly due to changes in Km . In contrast to the wild-type, the pH-rate profiles of the mutant showed that Km for several side chain-containing penicillin substrates increases when the pH is above 5.5. 6-Aminopenicillanic acid, which lacks a side chain, did not show this effect. With benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and carbenicillin, kcat for the mutant showed a similar pH dependence as the wild type. With 6-aminopenicillanic acid, kcat for the mutant was greater than that for the wild type. The nature of the 104 side chain may affect the environment of Asp132; double mutants N132D/E104X (where X can be Q or N) are unable to confer antibiotic resistance to bacterial cells. The computed contact interactions from modeling substrate complexes between benzylpenicillin or 6-aminopenicillanic acid with the N132D mutant confirmed the importance of the protonation state of residue Asp132 for the complex stability with side chain-containing substrates. The data indicate that the contact between the side chain of residue 132 and the substrate is relevant for the ground state recognition, but because of close contact with several important groups in its neighborhood, residue 132 is also indirectly involved in the catalytic step of the wild-type enzyme.

INTRODUCTIONClass A β-lactamases are serine hydrolase members of a group of enzymes that destroy β-lactam antibiotics by hydrolyzing the sensitive four-membered β-lactam ring. TEM β-lactamase from Escherichia coli is the most common plasmid-mediated enzyme of this class. Crystal structures of the β-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus (Herzberg, 1991), Bacillus licheniformis (Knox and Moews, 1991), and, recently, E. coli TEM β-lactamase (Strynadka et al., 1992; Jelsch et al., 1993) are known at high resolution. In addition, there is crystallographic work with some mutant variants (Herzberg et al., 1991; Knox et al., 1993), includ-ing one trapped in the acyl-enzyme intermediate (Strynadka et al., 1992). Also, there are reports about the structure of trapped intermediates of a class A enzyme in complex with an inhibitor molecule (Chen and Herzberg, 1992) or with a transition state analog (Chen et al., 1993).The generally accepted minimum kinetic scheme for β-lacta-mase is shown in, E+S⇀↽K0ES⇀k2EA⇀k2E+P(Eq. 1) where EA represents the acyl-enzyme. For such a scheme, Kcat=k2k3k2+k3(Eq. 1a) and Km=ksk3k2+k3(Eq. 1b) The role of specific amino acid residues in the enzyme-catalyzed process is not fully understood. It has been shown that besides serine 70, the transiently acylated residue, both lysine 73 and glutamic acid 166 are important for the catalytic mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis performed at these positions and in others resulted in enzyme variants with drastic loss of activity (Ellerby et al., 1990; Delaire et al., 1991; Brannigan et al., 1991; Lenfant et al., 1991). Recent kinetic (Adachi et al., 1991; Escobar et al., 1991) and structural (Strynadka et al., 1992; Knox et al., 1993) data indicate that the role of Glu166 involves its acting as a general base catalyst on water poised to attack the acyl enzyme carbonyl and thus facilitate deacylation. In spite of several possible routes that have been proposed (Herzberg and Moult, 1991 and references therein), the mechanism of the acylation half of the catalytic reaction remains unclear. Studies by Jacob and collaborators (Jacob et al., 1990a, 1990b) on the conserved triad SDN in Streptomyces albus β-lactamase showed that Asn 132 in this enzyme stabilizes the transition state rather than having a role in ground state binding.To understand the role of several conserved residues of the active site of TEMβ-lactamase, we have used random combinatorial mutagenesis and selective screening approaches (growing bacterial cells on ampicillin plates), in order to obtain protein variants that remain catalytically active. In this work, we present data from one such variant, Asp for Asn in position 132, that may help define the role of the contact between the Asn 132 residue and the substrate side chain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsBenzylpenicillin, ampicillin, 6-APA 1The abbreviations used are: APA6-aminopenicillanic acidMICminimum inhibitory concentrationWTwild type. , and carbenicillin (Fig. 1) were purchased from Sigma. Nitrocefin was a gift from Glaxo. Taq polymerase was purchased from Promega. The polymerase chain reactions were performed in a Biosycler oven. Restriction enzymes, Klenow fragment, and ligase were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim.Mutagenesis of the SDN RegionMutant β-lactamases were made as described in Merino et al.(1992). Mutations were introduced via polymerase chain reaction and sequenced with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The primer used for mutagenesis was 5′-CTGCCATAACCATGNNG/CNNG/CNNG/CACTGCGGCCAAC-3′, where N means an equimolar mixture of all four nucleotides and G/C means a mixture with 50% each G and C.Determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)The MICs were determined by a dilution method on Luria broth agar plates at 37°C, with inocula of 10-50 colony-forming units dispensed in 5-μl drops. The plates contained the antibiotic at several different concentrations plus kanamycin at 25 μg/ml. The minimum concentration inhibiting the growth of cells was taken as the MIC.Purification ProcedureThe wild type and mutant enzymes were purified as follows. β-Lactamase (WT or N132D) was expressed and purified from E. coli. Fresh colonies were inoculated into 6 liters of Luria-Bertani media and grown on a 37°C shaker for 12-14 h. After a cold shock treatment, cell debris was removed by centrifugation (6000 rpm for 10 min) and the cell-free supernatant mixed with of the total volume of 0.02 M sodium acetate, pH 4.8. Some proteins were removed by precipitation by gently swirling on a shaker at 4°C; the precipitate was removed by centrifugation as above and the supernatant (containing β-lactamase) was batch-loaded onto a CM-Sepharose (CL-6B from Sigma) column previously pre-equilibrated with the same sodium acetate buffer. The nonbound proteins were washed with the same buffer for several hours and the bound proteins eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.4 M NaCl. Fractions containing β-lactamase activity were pooled and exchanged via ultrafiltration with an Amicon YM10 filter into 0.025 M imidazole buffer, pH 7.0. This protein solution was loaded onto a chromatofocusing column (PBE94 from Pharmacia) using the same buffer as start buffer and eluted with a pH gradient of 7 to 4 using the pH 4 Polybuffer 74-HCl from Pharmacia. Fractions containing β-lactamase activity were pooled and exchanged into 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, by ultrafiltration as above. All proteins were purified to more than 90% homogeneity as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectrofocusing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Pharmacia PhastSystem.KineticsThe concentration of β-lactamase was determined by using an ε280 = 29,400 M -1 cm -1 . pH rate profiles for benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and 6-APA were determined from complete progress curves, using substrate concentrations at least 5 × Km or from initial velocities measurements, and the data fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The data were analyzed with Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck software) on a Macintosh computer. All points were determined at least in triplicate. The carbenicillin pH profile was obtained only by initial velocities using 10-15 different substrate concentrations bracketing the Km and the data fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equations using the Kaleidagraph program. The nitrocefin data were obtained by initial velocities measured at the respective optimal pH for the wild-type and N132D mutant. Because the Km for nitrocefin was quite high, only kcat /Km could be determined, using measurements of the first-order rate of hydrolysis under conditions of substrate concentrations much less than Km. Substrate hydrolysis was measured at 30°C with a Perkin-Elmer 320 spectrophotometer according to the method of Waley(1974). All buffers contained 0.5 M KCl and were brought to a final concentration of 50 mM buffer. The buffers used for the pH profiles were sodium acetate for pH 4.0-5.5, potassium phosphate for pH 6.0-7.5, and Tris-HCl for pH 8.0-8.5. The wavelengths for monitoring substrates were 240 nm for penicillins and 482 nm for nitrocefin.Computational ProceduresThe active site of the wild-type or N132D TEM β-lactamases, defined by all the amino acid residues and water molecules present within 10 Å radius around the Ser 70 Cα, was optimized by energy minimization using the all-atom consistence valence force field parameters and charges. The Asp 132 residue in the N132D mutant was modeled both in the protonated (neutral) or ionized form. The initial binding interactions of benzylpenicillin and 6-aminopenicillanic acid with the enzymes were studied by manual docking of the substrate to the active site followed by unconstrained energy minimization of the final complex. The substrates were manually fitted into the active site to position the β-lactam carbonyl oxygen in the oxyanion hole and to maximize hydrogen bonding. The model substrate was adjusted manually to relieve obvious steric problems with the protein.RESULTSDescription of Mutant EnzymesRandom combinatorial mutagenesis directed against the SDN region and selective screenings in ampicillin plates produced the mutant N132D described in this work. In order to probe the effect of secondary alterations in the environment of the N132D mutant, we modified the Glu 104 residue to different amino acids, including Asn and Gln, some of which are present in other class A β-lactamases (Asn in B. licheniformis enzyme).Antibiotic SusceptibilityAntibiotic susceptibility testing of E. coli strain JM101 carrying the plasmid-borne gene for the wild-type or mutant enzymes is shown in Table 1. The MIC values show that the N132D mutant has greatly decreased resistance to ampicillin (MIC = 20 μg/ml) compared with the wild-type (MIC = >2560 μg/ml). All of the double mutants N132D/E104X were unable to confer the resistance phenotype, as shown by the MIC levels against ampicillin, 6-APA, and benzylpenicillin.Tabled 1Substrate and pH Activity ProfilesThe effect of the substitution of Asp for Asn at residue 132 on the kinetic parameters for several penicillin substrates (Fig. 1) are reported in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:. As can be seen in Fig. 2, kcat of the N132D mutant is 2-fold lower with all the penicillin substrates tested, except 6-APA, as compared with the wild-type values. The data from the corresponding kcat versus pH curves were fit to to obtain pK values. Kobs=klim1+H/K1+K2/H(Eq. 2) Figure 4:kcat /Km pH profiles for the N132D mutant and the wild-type enzyme.

With this substrate, both pK1 and pK2 for the mutant enzyme had values very similar to the wild type (Table 3 and Fig. 2).With carbenicillin as a substrate, the wild-type kcat showed an anomalous pH dependence, similar to that shown for the Bacillus cereus β-lactamase (Hardy et al., 1984). Our mutant enzyme displayed a slightly different behavior which seems to fit better with the same modified equation () used in the work on the B. cereus β-lactamase. kcat=k(ESH2)limH/K1+1+K2/H+K2K3/H2 +k(ESH)limH2/K1K2+H/K2+1+K3/H(Eq. 3) The behavior of Km for the mutant can be separated in two groups, depending of the substrate used: (i) with benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and carbenicillin as substrates, Km increases at pH around 5.5 when compared with wild-type values, which remain low even at pH 7.5. Around pH 5.0, the Km of the mutant enzyme approaches wild-type values (Fig. 3, A-C). (ii) With 6APA as a substrate, the Km obtained for the mutant was higher than the wild-type value (an increase of about 5-fold) and that value remains stable for a broader pH range when compared with other penicillins (Fig. 3D).Figure 3:Km pH profiles for the N132D mutant and the wild-type enzyme. The panels are the same as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When compared at the pH optima, the catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km) of the mutant was around 30-50% of the wild-type efficiency, depending on the substrate (Fig. 4 and Table 2). The pH optimum of the mutant was shifted down by about 1 pH unit relative to the wild-type enzyme. This reflects a decrease of about 1 in pK2 and 0.5 in pK1 for the N132D mutant relative to the values for the wild-type (Table 3). With carbenicillin as substrate, the pH dependence of kcat /Km of the N132D mutant was different from that of the wild-type enzyme. Data from the N132D mutant with this substrate fit very well to the usual equation ().Tabled 1When tested with nitrocefin, an activated cephalosporin substrate, the mutant enzyme had a kcat /Km value around 2-3% of the wild-type enzyme when compared at the pH optima (kcat /KmWT = 4.2 × 106;mz -1 s -1 and kcat /Km mutant = 8.5 × 104; mz -1 s -1 ).Energy-minimized DockingAs shown in Table 4, the calculated interaction distances between the enzymes and the substrates correlate well with the observed pH activity behavior of the enzymes (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). The energy-minimized dockings of both substrates to the mutant protein, modeled with a protonated Asp 132 residue, show that the calculated distances are similar to those shown by the wild type. These results are in agreement with the high activity shown by the mutant enzyme at low pH (around 5-5.5). The calculated distances obtained in the complex of benzylpenicillin with the mutant protein modeled with an ionized Asp 132 were significantly longer than the previous modeled complexes. However, the contact distances shown between 6-APA and this same modeled protein were similar to the calculated ones for the wild-type or mutant protein modeled with a protonated Asp 132 residue. These results are consistent with the pH stability shown by the Km values for this substrate. In the oxyanion hole, the hydrogen bond between the β-lactam carbonyl and the backbone NH237 is stronger than the one with the backbone NH70, a result similar to that obtained by Juteau et al.(1991) when modeling substrate binding by the ROB-1 enzyme.Tabled 1DISCUSSIONHerzberg and Moult(1987) and Moews et al.(1990) working with different class A β-lactamases have proposed that the amide group of the Asn 132 side chain acts as an H-bond donor to the carbonyl group of the substrate side chain, and recently Strynadka et al.(1992), working with TEM β-lactamase, have shown this same contact. Also, the side chain of Asn 132 forms a strong hydrogen bond with that of Lys 73 and is in contact with a water molecule involved in a proposed replenishment mechanism of the hydrolytic water molecule (Knox and Moews, 1991) (Fig. 5). Additionally, in the B. licheniformis enzyme Asn 132 is in close contact with the side chain of the Asn 104 residue. In the TEM and S. aureus enzymes, this close contact between the side chains of residues 132 and 104 might be replaced by a contact between the side chain of Asn 132 and the main chain carbonyl of Glu 104 or Ala 104 , respectively (Fig. 5). As show in Fig. 5, the side chain of residue 104 turns away from residue 132 in the TEM enzyme but not in the B. licheniformis β-lactamase structure.Figure 5:Stereoview of some active site residues (TEM coordinates kindly provided by Dr. M. N. G. James). Potential hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines. Some crystallographic water molecules are included as solid spheres. In position 104 (Glu 104 in the E. coli TEM β-lactamase), we superimposed the structurally homologous residues of S. aureus (Ala 104 ) and B. licheniformis 749/C (Asn 104 ) enzymes (coordinates 3BLM and 4BLM, respectively; Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory). The deacylating water is labeled 321. Penicillin G (BPE) is positioned for α-face acylation by reactive Ser 70 as modeled by Moews et al. (1990).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Jacob et al. (1990a, 1990b) working with S. albus β-lactamase variants, where Asn 132 has been replaced with Ala or Ser, have proposed a role for this residue in transition state stabilization rather than in ground state binding. In that work, kcat was the most affected parameter, and the authors suggested an effect mainly in the acylation step. Those workers reported that the replacement N132A results in a very poor enzyme against all substrates tested and that the alteration N132S results in a slightly impaired enzyme against penicillin substrates. This latter mutant enzyme also showed poor activity against substrates that are lacking a side chain (6-APA), and finally, both mutant enzymes showed lower activities against cephalosporins as compared with penicillins.We believe that our variant, with a less size-disruptive modification (Asn to Asp), provides an interesting probe to determine the role of the contact between the Asn 132 residue and the substrate side chain, both in ground state recognition and in transition state stabilization.As can be seen in the Fig. 2, A-C, with all the side chain-containing penicillin substrates tested, kcat for the mutant decreased about 2-fold when compared with the corresponding wild-type values. At low pH (around pH 5.5), this behavior could be explained by the mutation decreasing the rate of both acylation and deacylation steps to a similar extent. This is sufficient to explain the decrease of kcat and the similarity, at this pH, of Km to wild-type values (Fig. 3, A-C). At pH higher than 5.5, Km is sharply increased, whereas in the wild-type enzyme Km values remain low even at pH 7.5 (Fig. 3, A-C). Thus, at pH 5.5 the effect of the substitution of aspartate for asparagine leads to destabilization of the transition state, whereas at higher pH the effect is on the ground state. Since N132D kcat for this kind of substrate follows a pH response similar to that shown by the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2, A-C), it implies that the perturbations of kcat /Km against pH in the mutant relative to the wild type (Fig. 4, A-C) is due mostly to the effect on the Ks component of Km.With a side chain-lacking substrate, such as 6-APA, both kcat and Km of the mutant are higher than the respective parameters of the wild-type enzyme. In kinetic terms (using), this might be explained by a better deacylation rate (k3), which would result in an increase in kcat and Km, as observed. The behavior of Km for the N132D mutant with 6-APA is different when compared with that of the other substrates (Fig. 3D). Km for this substrate stays at a low value between pH 5.5 and 7.5.Our results also indicate that the side chain of Glu 104 may perturb the environment of the aspartate in position 132. Analytical isoelectrofocusing results (data not shown) show that the N132D mutant has essentially the same pI as the wild-type enzyme. Thus, it appears that because of the proximity of glutamate 104 and aspartate 132 (Fig. 5), in the N132D mutant either or both of these carboxylic side chains have a significantly altered pKa. Substitutions in the residue position 104 of the N132D mutant produce enzyme variants unable to confer ampicillin resistance at the lower antibiotic concentrations tested as shown by the MIC analysis (Table 1).To rationalize the differences between the kinetic properties of the mutant and wild-type enzymes, we must analyze the possible consequences of contacts lacking in the mutant. We assume that the contact between the Asp 132 side chain and the substrate is formed only at low pH. At this pH (<5.5) there is no significant difference between the wild-type enzyme and the N132D mutant, as shown in Table 2. We postulate that the contact with Lys 73 is not seriously affected, and the effects proposed for the acylation step (k2) might be explained by subtle changes in the optimal geometry of that contact in response to the mutation. The effects proposed in the deacylation step (k3) might be explained by assuming that the mutant has lost the contact with the water molecule (Fig. 5), impairing the replenishment mechanism of the hydrolytic water. Finally, the suggested improvement in the deacylation step for side chain-lacking substrates (6-APA) might be explained by the presence of water in the extra space available in the active site with this kind of substrate, permitting the replenishment of the hydrolytic water.The modeling results suggest that side chain-lacking substrates are more tolerant than side chain-containing ones to the subtle conformational changes in the active site as result of the extra negative charge introduced (Asp 132 modeled in ionized form). The results suggest better contact distances between benzylpenicillin and the active site of the mutant with Asp 132 modeled in its protonated state (Table 4). This is in agreement with the activity showed by the mutant enzyme at low pH. However, we obtained a very unstable complex when this same substrate was docked in the active site of the mutant with Asp 132 modeled in its ionized form. With 6-APA, the modeling results show that the calculated distances between the docked substrate and the mutant protein, irrespective of the protonated state of residue 132, are closer to those shown by the wild-type enzyme (Table 4). Again, this results are in close agreement with the N132D activity pH response for this substrate.Our data show both similarities and differences with the work reported by Jacob et al. (1990a, 1990b). The main difference is the mutant activity against 6-APA. The present study shows that 6-APA was the least affected substrate in terms of the efficiency of the mutant compared with the wild-type enzyme with the same substrate. The kcat for the N132D mutant was higher than for the wild-type enzyme, and in agreement with the results of the S. albus work, there was a distinct increase in Km. The N132D TEM enzyme showed activity levels, against penicillin substrates, comparable with those shown by the N132S S. albus mutant and also had a marked preference to hydrolyze penicillins as compared with cephalosporins. We note that the alterations made in the S. albus β-lactamase are more disruptive than the one present in our mutant. The loss of the contact with Lys 73 (expected for both Ala or Ser mutants) and also the loss of the contact with the substrate (perhaps just in the Ala mutant, as suggested by the authors) results in a very poor enzyme (N132A) or in a slightly impaired enzyme (N132S). The proposed effect of both mutations only in the acylation rate could be rationalized if the extra space available in the mutation site could be filled with water molecules ready to carry out the suggested replenishment of the catalytic water, leaving the deacylation rate unaffected.In summary, we propose that the contact between the Asn 132 residue side chain and the carbonyl group of the substrate side chain is only relevant for ground state recognition. However, the present results and those of Jacob et al. (1990a, 1990b) show that due to additional contacts of Asn 132 with different groups of the active site, it is also indirectly involved in the catalytic mechanism. Mutations in Asn 132 could affect both the acylation rate by impairing the interaction of this residue with Lys 73 , and the deacylation rate by altering the control of the replenishment of the hydrolytic water as suggested by the contact of Asn 132 with a water molecule of a train leading from the solvent to the interior of the active site. INTRODUCTIONClass A β-lactamases are serine hydrolase members of a group of enzymes that destroy β-lactam antibiotics by hydrolyzing the sensitive four-membered β-lactam ring. TEM β-lactamase from Escherichia coli is the most common plasmid-mediated enzyme of this class. Crystal structures of the β-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus (Herzberg, 1991), Bacillus licheniformis (Knox and Moews, 1991), and, recently, E. coli TEM β-lactamase (Strynadka et al., 1992; Jelsch et al., 1993) are known at high resolution. In addition, there is crystallographic work with some mutant variants (Herzberg et al., 1991; Knox et al., 1993), includ-ing one trapped in the acyl-enzyme intermediate (Strynadka et al., 1992). Also, there are reports about the structure of trapped intermediates of a class A enzyme in complex with an inhibitor molecule (Chen and Herzberg, 1992) or with a transition state analog (Chen et al., 1993).The generally accepted minimum kinetic scheme for β-lacta-mase is shown in, E+S⇀↽K0ES⇀k2EA⇀k2E+P(Eq. 1) where EA represents the acyl-enzyme. For such a scheme, Kcat=k2k3k2+k3(Eq. 1a) and Km=ksk3k2+k3(Eq. 1b) The role of specific amino acid residues in the enzyme-catalyzed process is not fully understood. It has been shown that besides serine 70, the transiently acylated residue, both lysine 73 and glutamic acid 166 are important for the catalytic mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis performed at these positions and in others resulted in enzyme variants with drastic loss of activity (Ellerby et al., 1990; Delaire et al., 1991; Brannigan et al., 1991; Lenfant et al., 1991). Recent kinetic (Adachi et al., 1991; Escobar et al., 1991) and structural (Strynadka et al., 1992; Knox et al., 1993) data indicate that the role of Glu166 involves its acting as a general base catalyst on water poised to attack the acyl enzyme carbonyl and thus facilitate deacylation. In spite of several possible routes that have been proposed (Herzberg and Moult, 1991 and references therein), the mechanism of the acylation half of the catalytic reaction remains unclear. Studies by Jacob and collaborators (Jacob et al., 1990a, 1990b) on the conserved triad SDN in Streptomyces albus β-lactamase showed that Asn 132 in this enzyme stabilizes the transition state rather than having a role in ground state binding.To understand the role of several conserved residues of the active site of TEMβ-lactamase, we have used random combinatorial mutagenesis and selective screening approaches (growing bacterial cells on ampicillin plates), in order to obtain protein variants that remain catalytically active.

The study includes wild type azurin as well as Met 121 mutants of azurin, where methionine has been substituted by Ala, Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, and Leu.The nuclear quadrupole interaction of wild type azurin analyzed in the angular overlap model is well described as coordination of His 46 , His 117 , and Cys 112 and cannot be described by coordination of Met 121 and/or Gly 45 .For most of the mutants, there exist two coordination geometries of the cadmium ion. With the exception of the Glu and Asp mutants, one of the conformations is similar to the wild type conformation. The other coordination geometries are either best described by a coordinating water molecule close to the original methionine position or by coordination by the substituting amino acid. These experiments show that even though the methionine does not coordinate it plays an important role for the geometry of the metal site.The nuclear quadrupole interaction of stellacyanin was also measured. The value resembles the most prominent nuclear quadrupole interaction of the Met 121121 → Gln mutant of Alcaligenes denitrificans azurin, indicating that the structures of the two metal sites are similar.

The nuclear quadrupole interaction of wild type azurin analyzed in the angular overlap model is well described as coordination of His 46 , His 117 , and Cys 112 and cannot be described by coordination of Met 121 and/or Gly 45 . For most of the mutants, there exist two coordination geometries of the cadmium ion. With the exception of the Glu and Asp mutants, one of the conformations is similar to the wild type conformation. The other coordination geometries are either best described by a coordinating water molecule close to the original methionine position or by coordination by the substituting amino acid. These experiments show that even though the methionine does not coordinate it plays an important role for the geometry of the metal site. The nuclear quadrupole interaction of stellacyanin was also measured. The value resembles the most prominent nuclear quadrupole interaction of the Met 121121 → Gln mutant of Alcaligenes denitrificans azurin, indicating that the structures of the two metal sites are similar."

INTRODUCTION10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (10-FTHFDH) ( 1The abbreviations used are: 10-FTHFDH10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase10-HCO-H4PteGlu10-formyltetrahydrofolateH4PteGlutetrahydrofolate10-FDDF10-formyl-5,8-dideazafolate2-ME2-mercaptoethanolPCRpolymerase chain reaction.) (EC 1.5.1.6) catalyzes both the NADP + -dependent oxidation of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-HCO-H4PteGlu) to tetrahydrofolate and CO2 and the NADP + -independent hydrolysis of 10-HCO-H4PteGlu to tetrahydrofolate and formate(1Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18B: 793-798Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Rios-Orlandi E.M. Zarkadas C.G. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys.

The amino-terminal domain of rat liver 10-FTHFDH (residues 1-203) is 24-30% identical to a group of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylases (EC 2.1.2.1) from different species(4Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 417-902) of 10-FTHFDH has 46% identity with a series of NAD + -dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3), and the enzyme is able to oxidize aldehydes(4Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).All known aldehyde dehydrogenases contain a conserved cysteine, which, in the case of 10-FTHFDH, is Cys-707(4Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hempel J. Nicholas H. Lindahl R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1890-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The conserved cysteine is presumed to act as a nucleophile in the formation of an enzyme-linked thiohemiacetal intermediate(6Weiner H. Farres J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Zheng C.-F. Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Wermuth B. Crabb D.W. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Vol. 3. Plenum Press, New York1991: 13-17Google Scholar, 7Blatter E.E. Abriola D.P. Pietruszko R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A number of different approaches may be used to identify the amino acid at the active site of an enzyme. Using an affinity label, Blatter et al.(7Blatter E.E. Abriola D.P. Pietruszko R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) found that Cys-302 formed a covalent intermediate with the substrate in human aldehyde dehydrogenase(7Blatter E.E. Abriola D.P. Pietruszko R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that Cys-302 is essential for enzyme activity of rat liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, whereas Cys-49 and Cys-162 can be changed to alanine without altering enzyme activity(6Weiner H. Farres J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Zheng C.-F. Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Wermuth B. Crabb D.W. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Vol. 3. Plenum Press, New York1991: 13-17Google Scholar). Additionally, site-directed mutagenesis experiments have shown that serine 74 is also important for enzyme activity(6Weiner H. Farres J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Zheng C.-F. Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Wermuth B. Crabb D.W. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Vol. 3. Plenum Press, New York1991: 13-17Google Scholar). This observation was unexpected because this serine is conserved only in mammalian aldehyde dehydrogenases(5Hempel J. Nicholas H. Lindahl R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1890-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that serine 74 is not involved in aldehyde oxidation but may be involved in NAD + binding(8Rout U.K. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8955-8961Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study we expressed rat 10-FTHFDH in a baculovirus system and used site-directed mutagenesis to elucidate the role of the highly conserved Cys-707 in the activity of the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials10-Formyl-5,8-dideazafolate (10-FDDF) was obtained from Dr. John B. Hynes, Dept. of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Medical University of South Carolina. (6R,S)-10-HCO-H4PteGlu was prepared from (6R,S)-5-HCO-H4PteGlu (Sigma) by the method of Rabinowitz(9Rabinowitz J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 814-816Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA) or from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Grace's insect cell medium and baculovirus agarose were obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Intergen (Purchase, NY). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma.Vector Construction and Enzyme ExpressionA PCR fragment including 277 base pairs of the 5′-coding sequence of 10-FTHFDH from the start codon to a unique NcoI restriction site and having an XbaI restriction site inserted at the 5′-end was synthesized using two oligonucleotides 5′-CCGGCCCATGGGTATGAACTGGCTGCAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGCTCTAGAATGAAGATTGCAGTAATCGGA-3′ by PCR using a Gene Amp kit (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). The cDNA of rat liver 10-FTHFDH (4Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned from pBS KS + II into the pVL 1393 baculovirus vector (Invitrogen) through the unique EcoRI restriction site. A fragment between the unique XbaI restriction site of pVL 1393 and the unique NcoI restriction site in the 10-FTHFDH cDNA sequence, including the whole 5′-noncoding sequence of cDNA was removed and replaced with the XbaI-NcoI PCR-generated fragment, containing the coding sequence (Fig. 1). The sequence of the construct was confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (10Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52344) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). This construct was expressed in Sf9 cells, which were grown in monolayer using the MaxBac expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions.Mutant ConstructionMutation of the 10-FTHFDH was achieved by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The codon for cysteine, TGC, at position 707 was altered to GCC to produce an alanine-containing mutant. The Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), based on the method of Deng and Nickoloff(11Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), was used to introduce the mutation into the pVL 1393-10-FTHFDH construct. Two oligonucleotides were used, the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-CAAAGGGGAGAACGCCATTGCGGCAG-3′ for introduction of the mutation in 10-FTHFDH sequence and a selection oligonucleotide 5′-GAATTCCGGAGAGGCCTCTGCAGATC-3′ for conversion of one unique restriction site, XmaIII to StuI, which was also unique, in pVL 1393. The mutagenic experiments were carried out according to the Clontech protocol. Introduction of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing(10Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52344) Google Scholar). The mutant construct was expressed in Sf9 cells similar to that for wild type protein.Analysis of Recombinant 10-FTHFDHSDS-electrophoresis of 10-FTHFDH was done according to the method of Laemmli(12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205953) Google Scholar). Western immunoblot analysis was performed as described by Burnette (13Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5863) Google Scholar) with rabbit polyclonal antiserum against pure rat liver 10-FTHFDH and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad)(14Leary J.J. Brigati D.J. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4045-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The mutant protein showed the same level of expression as wild type recombinant 10-FTHFDH. Analysis of culture medium and cell extract revealed that most of the mutant enzyme was released from cells into the culture medium, similar to the wild type recombinant enzyme, possibly due to lysis of the cells, which occurs in the later post-infection period(15Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 47-55Crossref Scopus (865) Google Scholar). More than 80% of the total enzyme was found in the culture medium. Immunoblotting with specific anti-10-FTHFDH antiserum showed only one major band corresponding to the enzyme itself, indicating no proteolytic degradation of the enzyme during production.Purification of Recombinant 10-FTHFDHThe enzyme was purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography on a column of Sepharose-5-formyltetrahydrofolate(16Cook R.J. Wagner C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Cook R.J. Wagner C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 122: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A column (1.5 × 10 cm) was packed with about 8.0 ml of settled gel and equilibrated with 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mM 2-ME and 1 mM NaN3 (buffer 1). Medium (200 ml), plus 2-ME and NaN3 at 10 and 1 mM, respectively, was applied to the affinity column. The column was then washed with buffer 1 (100 ml) followed by the same buffer containing 1 M KCl (100 ml). The enzyme was then eluted from the column with buffer 1 containing 1 M KCl and 20 mM folic acid. The eluate was passed through a column of Bio-Gel P6-DG (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer 1 at pH 6.2 to remove excess folate. The eluate was concentrated to approximately 5 ml using an Amicon (Beverly, MA) filtration cell. Additional purification was done on a DE-52 column with the use of a linear NaCl gradient (0-0.5 M). The enzyme peak was eluted at 0.21 M NaCl, collected, desalted on a column of Bio-Gel P6-DG, and stored at 4°C. The mutant enzyme was purified by the same procedure. Affinity chromatography resulted in purification of both wild type and mutant recombinant protein from most of the proteins of bovine serum. Additional purification on a DE-52 column gave homogeneous preparations for both proteins.Molecular Size DeterminationA molecular size detector (model DynaPro-801, Protein Solutions, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) employing laser-light scattering methodology (18Yarmush D.M. Murphy R.M. Colton C.K. Fisch M. Yarmush M.L. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Cleland J.L. Wang D.I.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11072-11078Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Ponting C.P. Holland S.K. Cederholm-Williams S.A. Marshall J.M. Brown A.J. Spraggon G. Blake C.C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used to analyze recombinant 10-FTHFDH under non-denaturing conditions. The enzyme (in 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mM 2-ME and 1 mM NaN3) was concentrated using a Centricon 30 (Amicon) to about 1 mg/ml. Aliquots of this solution (200 μl) were filtered (0.45 μm; Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) to remove any dust particles prior to measurement. Each sample was measured for 20 cycles and the results analyzed using AutoPro 801 Data Analysis Software (Protein Solutions).Measurement of Enzyme ActivityAll assays were performed at 30°C in a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 4B double beam spectrophotometer (Norwalk, CT). For measurement of hydrolase activity, the reaction mixture contained 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mM 2-ME, and varying amounts of substrate, either 10-HCO-H4PteGlu or 10-FDDF (0.5-18 μM). The enzyme (1 μg) was added in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme and read against a blank cuvette containing all components except enzyme. Appearance of product was measured at either 295 nm for 5,8-dideazafolate or 300 nm for H4PteGlu using molar extinction coefficients of 18.9 × 103 and 21.7 × 103 for 5,8-dideazafolate (21Smith G.K. Mueller W.T. Benkovic P.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and H4PteGlu(22Case G.L. Kaisaki P.J. Steele R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1024-1027Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), respectively. Addition of NADP + to the reaction mixture provided a measure of both dehydrogenase and hydrolase activity, i.e. total activity of the enzyme. Hydrolase activity measured in the absence of NADP + was subtracted from the total activity to give the dehydrogenase activity. Dehydrogenase activity was also measured independently using the increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to production of NADPH and the molar extinction coefficient of 6.2 × 103.Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was assayed using propanal essentially as described by Lindahl and Evces(23Lindahl R. Evces S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 3383-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 60 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 5 mM propanal, 1 mM NADP + , and enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. Activity was estimated from the increase in absorbance at 340 nm.Fluorescence StudiesBinding of NADP + to 10-FTHFDH was detected by measuring the quenching of enzyme fluorescence. These experiments were done on a Perkin-Elmer model 650-40 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Protein samples (9.0 nM) were in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 50 mM 2-ME. The NADP + concentration was varied from 0.02 μM to 10 μM. Fluorescence excitation was at 291 nm, and the emission was monitored at 340 nM(24Birdsall B. King R.W. Wheeler M.R. Lewis C.A. Goode S.R. Dunlar R.B. Roberts G.C.K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Kd for NADP + was calculated from data on fluorescence quenching in the presence of NADP + , which were plotted in a linear form(25Chow S.F. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15516-15521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSAnalysis of 10-FTHFDH Oligomeric StructureNative 10-FTHFDH has been reported to exist as a dimer (16Cook R.J. Wagner C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or tetramer(2Rios-Orlandi E.M. Zarkadas C.G. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Scrutton M.C. Beis I. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Using a light scattering technique, we investigated the oligomeric structure of wild type and mutant recombinant 10-FTHFDH. The analysis showed that both enzymes form monodisperse solutions with a Stokes radius of 7.63 nm and estimated molecular mass of 398.77 kDa for the wild type enzyme and 7.53 nm and 393.15 kDa for the mutant enzyme. This indicates that both wild type and mutant recombinant 10-FTHFDH are tetramers of the 99-kDa monomers(4Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Enzymatic Activity of Mutant 10-FTHFDHThe rationale for performing the site-directed mutagenesis was to confirm the putative role of Cys-707 in the catalysis of the dehydrogenase reaction. Assay of the C707A mutant in the presence of NADP showed no dehydrogenase activity with either 10-HCO-H4PteGlu or 10-FDDF (Fig. 2). The wild type recombinant enzyme assayed under the same conditions showed dehydrogenase activity comparable to the native rat liver enzyme.Figure 2:Activity of wild type and mutant 10-FTHFDH. HYD, hydrolase activity; DH, dehydrogenase activity; TOTAL, total activity (measures both dehydrogenase and hydrolase activity). The assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, 10-HCO-H4PteGlu used as a substrate; B, 10-FDDF used as a substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been shown that 10-FTHFDH is able to oxidize a series of aldehyde substrates in the presence of NADP(4Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of propanal oxidation by recombinant 10-FTHFDH showed a Km of 638 μM and an estimated Vmax of 245 nmol of NADP min -1 mg -1 . These parameter were similar to those of the natural rat liver enzyme. ( 2R. J. Cook and C. Wagner, unpublished results.) The C707A mutant enzyme was unable to oxidize propanal. These results show that the C707A mutant 10-FTHFDH has completely lost dehydrogenase activity.Analysis of activity of mutant 10-FTHFDH in the absence of NADP + showed that the C707A mutant was able to catalyze the hydrolase reaction. Hydrolase activity of the C707A mutant 10-FTHFDH was comparable to the activity of wild type recombinant enzyme for both 10-HCO-H4PteGlu and 10-FDDF (Table 1).Tabled 1Effect of NADP + on 10-FTHFDH FluorescenceTo check whether the mutation influenced the binding of the coenzyme, we titrated the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence with NADP + . No significant difference in fluorescence quenching between wild type and C707A mutant recombinant 10-FTHFDH was observed (Fig. 3). The Kd for NADP + binding calculated from these data were approximately 0.3 μM for both wild type and mutant enzyme.Figure 3:Fluorescence titration of 10-FTHFDH with NADP + . Curves 1 (opencircles), wild type recombinant 10-FTHFDH; curves2 (darkcircles), C707A mutant 10-FTHFDH. Insertion shows the fluorescence data plotted in linear form. The value (1 - F/Fα ) -1 was plotted against the inverse of NADP + concentration(25Chow S.F. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15516-15521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is a modified form of the classical Stern-Volmer plot, which relates the drop in fluorescence to the concentration of a collisional quencher (see (26Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) for review). F is intrinsic fluorescence observed at an NADP + concentration; Fα is fluorescence in the absence of NADP + . The slope of the line (least squares fit) gave a Kd that was approximately 0.3 μM for both wild type and the C707A mutant 10-FTHFDH. The protein was excited at 291 nm and the emission monitored at 340 nm. 9.0 nM of each enzyme was used for the analysis, and concentration of NADP + was varied from 0.02 μM to 10.0 μM. Variation of the measured values was about 5%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe sequence identity between 10-FTHFDH and the group of aldehyde dehydrogenases suggested that Cys-707 could be the active site nucleophile. In order to test this hypothesis, Cys-707 in 10-FTHFDH was modified. The closest amino acid substitution for cysteine is serine. Serine can, however, function as a nucleophile in place of cysteine in some enzyme-catalyzed reactions(27Witkowski A. Witkowska H.E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 379-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we replaced Cys-707 with alanine. Such a substitution is used often in site-directed mutagenesis to study the role of cysteine residues. In our experiments mutation of Cys-707 of 10-FTHFDH to Ala resulted in complete loss of dehydrogenase activity of the enzyme for both the native substrate 10-HCO-H4PteGlu and 10-FDDF. The C707A mutant also lost the ability to oxidize propanal, while wild type recombinant 10-FTHFDH oxidized propanal as well as the native rat liver enzyme. Measurement of binding of the coenzyme, NADP + , by fluorescence titration showed no difference between the mutant and wild type enzyme, indicating that loss of dehydrogenase activity was not due to any change in the coenzyme binding site.Substitution of a single amino acid residue can sometimes result in a decrease of enzyme activity even if this residue is not involved in the active site due to changes in the higher order protein structure(28Ackers G.K. Smith F.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 597-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Such critical residues play a basic role in protein folding and/or in supporting correct protein structure(29Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6885-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 30Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 353-403Google Scholar). Replacement of such residues could lead to decreased protein stability (31Garvey E.P. Matthews C.R. Narang S.A. Protein Engineering. Butterworths, Boston1990: 37-63Crossref Google Scholar) and also to a decreased level of expression due to higher accessibility of mutant proteins to proteases(32Hanioka N. Gonzalez F.J. Lindberg G.L. Korzekwa K.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many amino acid substitutions do not have large effects on protein stability(33Pakula A.A. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1990; 344: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Alber T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 765-798Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even when a replaced residue is essential for protein conformation, protein structures adjust to compensate for changes in sequence(29Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6885-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our study did not reveal any changes in stability of the C707A mutant in comparison with the wild type protein and both displayed a similar level of expression. Moreover, the Kd values for NADP + were similar for both enzymes. The behavior of the mutant during the purification procedure was also identical to that of the wild type recombinant protein, indicating no gross alteration of the native structure(33Pakula A.A. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1990; 344: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is known that native 10-FTHFDH forms oligomers(2Rios-Orlandi E.M. Zarkadas C.G. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 3Scrutton M.C. Beis I. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 833-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Cook R.J. Wagner C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4427-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); therefore, we also determined the oligomeric structure of the wild type recombinant and the mutant enzymes. For this purpose, we used a laser-light scattering technique. This technique involves analysis of the temporal fluctuations in the intensity of light scattered by the Brownian motion of macromolecules. It provides a rapid, accurate, and noninvasive method of determining the translational diffusion coefficient of macromolecules that can be related to an effective size(18Yarmush D.M. Murphy R.M. Colton C.K. Fisch M. Yarmush M.L. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The analysis revealed that both wild type and mutant proteins existed as tetramers. The fact that the entire population of the active wild type recombinant 10-FTHFDH was organized as a tetramer indicates that this is the functional form of the enzyme. Since the C707A mutant 10-FTHFDH also forms a tetramer, this suggests they have similar conformations. Based on all these observations, we assume that the substitution of an alanine for the cysteine did not change protein conformation and stability. However, conservative mutations that dramatically reduce activity without changes in protein stability strongly suggest that a residue is important for substrate recognition or activity.The mutation of Cys-707 to Ala did not produce any changes in the hydrolase activity of 10-FTHFDH. This indicates that the enzyme has two different catalytic sites. This observation is not surprising since Rios-Orlandi et al.(2Rios-Orlandi E.M. Zarkadas C.G. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that both dehydrogenase and hydrolase activities can take place simultaneously. The existence of two different functional domains was predicted when the sequence of the enzyme was determined(4Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study by Schirch et al.(35Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol.

Similar results were obtained for aldehyde dehydrogenase from rat liver mitochondria(6Weiner H. Farres J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Zheng C.-F. Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Wermuth B. Crabb D.W. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Vol. 3. Plenum Press, New York1991: 13-17Google Scholar), which has 46% homology with the carboxyl-terminal domain of rat 10-FTHFDH(4Cook R.J. Lloyd R.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4965-4973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aldehyde dehydrogenase with the corresponding C302A mutation was devoid of activity(6Weiner H. Farres J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Zheng C.-F. Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Wermuth B. Crabb D.W. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Vol. 3. Plenum Press, New York1991: 13-17Google Scholar). At the same time substitution an alanine for 2 other cysteines in positions 49 and 162 of aldehyde dehydrogenase did not result in changes of enzyme activity(6Weiner H. Farres J. Wang T.T.Y. Cunningham S.J. Zheng C.-F. Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Wermuth B. Crabb D.W. Enzymology and Molecular Biology of Carbonyl Metabolism. Vol. 3. Plenum Press, New York1991: 13-17Google Scholar). Apparently, the dehydrogenase catalytic site of 10-FTHFDH is structurally similar to that of aldehyde dehydrogenase with a cysteine as a catalytic nucleophile residue and supports the role of a thiohemiacetal intermediate in the reaction mechanism.

(EC 1.5.1.6) catalyzes both the NADP + -dependent oxidation of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-HCO-H4PteGlu) to tetrahydrofolate and CO2 and the NADP + -independent hydrolysis of 10-HCO-H4PteGlu to tetrahydrofolate and formate(1Kutzbach C.

To investigate the relative localization of these biosynthetic enzymes, intact and properly oriented rat liver Golgi preparations were incubated with XylβMU and 1 μM UDP-[3H]Gal and then chased with 5 μM of unlabeled UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcUA, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, and CMP-Neu5Ac. Under these conditions, no intervesicular transport occurs and acceptor labeling depends entirely upon transporter-mediated delivery of the labeled sugar nucleotides into the lumen of a vesicle and co-localization of the appropriate glycosyltransferases. The labeled products were isolated from the incubation medium and from within the Golgi and their structures analyzed by C18, anion-exchange, and amine adsorption high performance liquid chromatography in combination with glycosidase digestions. Surprisingly, the major products within the Golgi were two sialylated xylosides (Siaα2,3Galβ1,4XylβMU and Siaα2,8Siaα2,3Galβ1,4XylβMU) rather than the expected group of partially completed GAG core structures. Less than 10% of the products within the Golgi are the expected core structures containing a second Gal residue or, in addition, GlcUA. The amount of the sialylated products is only partially decreased if the chase is omitted or if the chase is done in the absence of added CMP-Sia, suggesting a pool of previously transported CMP-Sia drives synthesis of the major products. Conversely, when detergent permeabilized vesicles are provided with high concentration of the same sugar nucleotides, the ratio of sialylated products is reduced and replaced by an increase in GAG-like products. These results argue that GAG core-specific Gal transferase I and II are not extensively co-localized within the same Golgi compartment. By contrast, glycosaminoglycan core Gal transferase I is substantially co-localized with an α-2,3-sialyltransferase and an α-2,8-sialyltransferase. Incubating intact Golgi vesicles with exogenous diffusible acceptors offers a novel method to assess the functional co-localization of glycosyltransferases of multiple pathways within the Golgi compartments. 4-Methylumbelliferyl-β-xyloside (XylβMU) primes glycosaminoglycan synthesis by first serving as an acceptor for the addition of 2 galactoses and 1 glucuronic acid residue to make the typical core structure, GlcUAβ1, 3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4XylβMU.

Incubating intact Golgi vesicles with exogenous diffusible acceptors offers a novel method to assess the functional co-localization of glycosyltransferases of multiple pathways within the Golgi compartments. Most of the glycosylation reactions involved in the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates (glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids) occur in the Golgi. The sugar nucleotide donors are made in the cytoplasm, transported, and concentrated into the Golgi lumen by specific transporters(1Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferases located on the lumenal face of the Golgi utilize the transported nucleotide sugars to glycosylate the various glycoconjugate acceptors transiting through different Golgi subcompartments during their biosynthetic maturation. A popular view is that the required glycosyltransferases are sequentially ordered in the Golgi cis, medial, trans compartments roughly corresponding to the known order of glycosylations(2Rothman J.E. Orci L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1460-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Roth J. J. Electron Microsc. Tech. 1991; 17: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Goldberg D.E.

Tech. 1991; 17: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An alternative perspective of the Golgi is that the glycosyltransferase organization is more flexible and cell-type dependent(10Bretscher M.S. Munro S.

Regardless of the specific distribution of glycosyltransferases, any glycosylation step requires that a functionally active Golgi compartment must have 1) sugar nucleotide transporters to deliver 2) the donor sugar nucleotides to the lumen of the compartment where 3) the acceptors and 4) glycosyltransferases are spatially and temporally co-localized(15Varki A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the dynamic setting of the living cell, vesicular trafficking (transport) continuously delivers maturing glycoconjugates from one compartment to the next. In an in vitro, non-transporting, static system, a functional compartment defines itself by having all the essential components spatially co-localized. glycosaminoglycan 4-methylumbelliferyl Chinese hamster ovary cells high performance liquid chromatography Newcastle disease virus Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-xylose crude cell smooth membrane supernatant extract supernatant pellet extract supernatant extract pellet.

A chase with non-labeled sugar nucleotides led to further glycosylation of the labeled endogenous acceptors. Since this occurred in the absence of intervesicular transport, all of the contributing transporters and transferases involved in the labeling and subsequent glycosylation of the products must have resided in a single functional compartment as defined above. We have extended this approach by using a small freely diffusable glycoside in place of the normal endogenous acceptors. We chose XylβMU as a specific acceptor for the GAG core-specific galactosyltransferase I, and then asked whether other glycosyltransferases and sugar nucleotide transporters needed for GAG core synthesis were also functionally co-localized with this transferase. XylβMU primes glycosaminoglycan synthesis by first serving as an acceptor for the addition of galactose and glucuronic acid residues to make the core structure, GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4XylβMU(19Kjellen L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1618-1627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results obtained in the present studies using the rat liver “freeze-frame” Golgi incubations suggest that the first GAG core-specific galactosyltransferase is substantially co-localized with one or more sialyltransferases and not with the second galactosyltransferase required for GAG core synthesis. This unexpected co-localization may explain why, in a previous study(20Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1618-1627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sialylated xylosides were the major products made by melanoma and CHO cells incubated with XylβMU. Using purified Golgi vesicles and diffusible acceptors offers a novel method to assess the functional co-localization of glycosyltransferases within the Golgi compartments. UDP-[6-3H]galactose (10 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals or prepared by the procedure of Hayes and Varki(21Hayes B.K. Varki A. Anal.

Unlabeled UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GlcUA, UDP-GalNAc, CMP-Neu5Ac, and 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-xyloside (XylβMU) were purchased from Sigma. N-Acetyllactosamine was purchased from Calbiochem. Jack bean β-galactosidase, Streptococcus pneumoniae β-galactosidase, bovine testicular β-galactosidase, Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase, Salmonella typhimurium sialidase, and Newcastle disease virus neuraminidase were from Oxford Glycosystems. Bovine testes β-1,3-glucuronidase was a kind gift from Dr. Phillip Stahl, Washington University, St. Louis, MO. Ilimaquinone was a generous gift from Dr. Vivek Malhotra, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA. Micro-Spin filters were manufactured by Lida Manufacturing Corp., Kenosha, WI. C18 spice cartridges and C18 modified silica gel resin were obtained from Analtech, Newark, DE. Golgi-enriched membranes were prepared from rat liver essentially as described by Leelavathi et al.(22Leelavathi D.E. Estes L.W. Feingold D.S. Lombardi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 124-138Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar), Tabas and Kornfeld(23Tabas I. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16139-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All sucrose solution concentrations were verified by specific gravity measurement. All procedures were carried out at 0-4°C unless otherwise noted. Four male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (3-4 months old; Charles River) were fasted overnight, anesthetized with isoflurane, and decapitated with a guillotine. The blood was drained for about 30 s, and the livers were rapidly excised and placed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.5 M sucrose in 50 mM sodium maleate, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 6.5). The excised livers were then blotted dry, weighed, finely minced with fine scissors and razor blades, and placed in homogenization buffer at 6-7 g/20 ml. The liver was homogenized with a two-speed Bio Homogenizer (M133/1281-0, BioSpec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK) at high speed for 30 s and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min in a Sorvall SA600 rotor. The postnuclear supernatant was carefully decanted from the loose pellet and saved. The pellet was resuspended in one half the original volume of homogenization buffer and re-homogenized and centrifuged as above. The postnuclear supernatants were combined and portions (16 ml) were layered over 8 ml of 1.3 M sucrose in 50 mM sodium maleate, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 6.5, buffer (MgM) in a centrifuge tube for the Beckman SW28 rotor. The postnuclear supernatant was overlaid with 13 ml of MgM and centrifuged for 2.5 h at 23,000 rpm. The crude smooth membrane fraction (CS) at and just below the 1.3 M sucrose interface was collected and adjusted to a final sucrose concentration of 1.1 M based on specific gravity. Portions (18 ml) of the CS were layered over 8 ml of 1.25 M sucrose in MgM in a centrifuge tube for the Beckman SW28 rotor. The CS was overlaid with 7 ml of 1.0 M sucrose in MgM, and this was overlaid with 4 ml of MgM. The Golgi membrane fraction was floated to the MgM, 1.0 M sucrose interface by centrifugation for 1.5 h at 23,000 rpm in the SW28 rotor. The Golgi membrane enriched fraction was collected from the MgM, 1.0 M interface and adjusted to a final sucrose concentration of 0.37 M and kept on ice. Purification of Golgi membranes was monitored by assaying for galactosyltransferase enrichment. UDP-Gal:GlcNAc Galβ1,4-galactosyltransferase was assayed exactly as described previously(16Hayes B.K. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16139-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two separate preparations were used in the experiments described in this report, and both had comparable specific activities ( ~ 2.5 milliunits/mg of protein). Contamination of the Golgi membranes with soluble cytoplasmic enzymes was followed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity. Appropriate dilutions of the subcellular fractions were incubated in a 1-ml reaction at 23°C containing 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 0.22 mM NADH. Enzyme activity was measured by following the oxidation of NADH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. One unit equals 1 μmol of NADH oxidized per min at 23°C. Portions (0.5 mg) of the Golgi-enriched fraction were incubated with 1 μM UDP-[3H]Gal (2.5 μCi; 10 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 250 μl containing 5 mM MnCl2, MgM buffer, approximately 0.32 M sucrose, and varying concentrations of XylβMU. Incubations were done at room temperature (22-23°C) for 15 min and, unless otherwise noted, were chased for an additional 15 min after adding 6.25 μl of a mixture of unlabeled sugar nucleotides containing 220 μM each of UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcUA, CMP-Neu5Ac, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc in MgM buffer to give a final concentration of 5 μM each. The incubations were stopped by the addition of approximately 10 volumes of ice-cold MgM buffer and immediately centrifuged for 20 min at 70,000 rpm in the Beckman TLA-100.2 rotor in a TL100 ultracentrifuge. The supernatants were collected, frozen at −80°C, and lyophilized. The pellets were gently surface-washed three times with ice-cold MgM buffer and frozen at −80°C. To verify that the incubations with the Golgi-enriched fraction were dependent on the transport of nucleotide sugars, reactions were carried out as above in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100. To demonstrate the absence of intercompartmental transport, reactions were carried out as above after pretreatment of the Golgi-enriched fraction with 2 mMN-ethylmaleimide (24Balch W.E. Glick B.S. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 525-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or 30 μM ilimaquinone(25Takizawa P.A. Yucel J.K. Veit B. Faulkner D.J. Deerinck T. Soto G. Ellisman M. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 73: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To control for the possibility that galactose labeled xyloside product could diffuse from one compartment to another, reactions were carried out as above in the presence of 4 units/ml β-galactosidase (jack bean). Additional reactions were carried out after preincubating the Golgi fraction with 1 mMN-acetyllactosamine to attempt to deplete the endogenous CMP-Sia pools and thus favor the formation of GAG core products. These reactions were stopped after the primary 15-min incubation and not chased with the cold nucleotide sugars used in the standard incubation conditions described above. The controls for these incubations used the standard incubation conditions without the nucleotide sugar chase. In another reaction, the Golgi fraction was incubated using the standard conditions except that the chase contained only 5 μM UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcUA. Transport-independent, permeabilized Golgi reactions were carried out with the following modifications to the standard incubation conditions. The Golgi membranes were permeabilized by the addition of 0.2% Triton X-100, the UDP-[3H]Gal concentration was increased to 50 μM (25 μCi; 2 Ci/mmol), and the concentration of the nucleotide sugars present during the chase was increased to 100 μM. To verify that the purified Golgi vesicle fraction was properly oriented and sealed, protease protection of radiolabeled endogenous acceptors was assayed using the methods described previously(16Hayes B.K. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16139-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity of the Golgi vesicles to transport UDP-Gal and transfer radiolabeled Gal to endogenous acceptors was quantified as described by Perez and Hirschberg(26Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The lyophilized supernatants from the Golgi incubations were extracted with two 1-ml portions of 70% ethanol. The supernatant extracts (SEs) were dried in vacuo on a shaker evaporator at 40°C. The ethanol-insoluble material (SPs) was saved and stored frozen. The XylβMU products were purified from the dried supernatant extracts by reverse phase chromatography on C18 spice cartridges (27Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconjugate J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 28Sampath D. Varki A. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4440-4455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which had been pre-washed with 5-10 volumes each of absolute methanol and water, and equilibrated with 1 M NaCl. The SEs were redissolved in 1 ml of 1 M NaCl and passed through the C18 cartridges. The cartridges were washed with two 1-ml portions of 1 M NaCl followed by two 1-ml washes with distilled water. The bound XylβMU products were eluted with three 1-ml portions of 40% methanol (SE40s). The remainder of bound products were eluted with two 1-ml portions of absolute methanol. The frozen pellets from the Golgi incubations were resuspended by sonication in 0.5 ml 70% ethanol. The samples were centrifuged at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. The pellet was again resuspended by sonication in 0.5 ml of 70% ethanol, and the centrifugation was repeated. The supernatants (XTs) were combined and dried in a Savant Speed-Vac. The extracted pellets (XPs) were solubilized by sonication in 250 μl of 2% SDS in 10 mM Tris base for 10-20 s and stored frozen at −20°C. The XylβMU products were purified from the dried supernatants (XTs) by reverse phase chromatography on C18 spin columns which had been pre-washed with four column volumes each of methanol, distilled water, and 1 M NaCl. The XTs were redissolved in 100 μl of distilled water and applied to the top of the C18 resin (0.2-ml bed volume) in microcentrifuge spin filter baskets. The spin columns were microcentrifuged at 3000 rpm for 1-2 min. The columns were washed with three 200-μl portions of 1 M NaCl followed by two 200-μl washes with distilled water. The bound XylβMU products were eluted with three 200-μl portions of 40% methanol (XT40s). The remainder of bound products were eluted with two 200-μl portions of absolute methanol. The presence of detergent in the supernatants of the permeabilized Golgi incubations resulted in the elution of some of the anionic xyloside products in the water washes during the purification on the C18 cartridges. Initially, these were recovered by repurification of the water washes. Subsequently, we found that these anionic xylosides were retained on the C18 cartridges when washing was done with 0.1 M NH4COOH, pH 6, instead of distilled water. The radiolabeled xyloside products were analyzed by C18 reverse-phase HPLC on a 4.6 mm × 25-cm Microsorb MV-C18 column. The column was eluted isocratically with water for 5 min followed by a 0-50% methanol gradient over 45 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and assayed by liquid scintillation counting. The column was washed for 5-10 min with 100% methanol between runs. Anionic xyloside products with more than one negative charge bound to the C18 cartridges or spin columns during purification but were not retained on the C18 HPLC column. These were analyzed by modifying the above gradient; the water was replaced with 0.1 M NH4COOH, pH 6. Analysis of xyloside products by amine adsorption HPLC was done using a 4.6 mm × 25-cm Microsorb-MV amino-bonded silica column. The gradient was 80-40% acetonitrile in water over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Ion exchange HPLC analysis was carried out using the above amino column using the following gradient. After injection, the column was washed with water for 2 min; then a gradient of 0-50 mM sodium phosphate pH 4.3 over 25 min; 50-150 mM over 15 min; and, 150-250 mM over 10 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. A small amount of Na2[ 35 35 S]SO4 (50-200 cpm) was used as an internal marker in each run. Sialidase and β-galactosidase digestions were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations in volumes of 10-50 μl using the supplied buffers. All digestions were terminated by heating at 100°C for 2-5 min, cooled, and microcentrifuged. β-Glucuronidase digestions were performed in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, in 10-50 μl with 1 μl of enzyme (150 Fishman units/ml) overnight. Sialidase and β-glucuronidase digestions were monitored using QAE-Sephadex in small columns as described previously (28Sampath D. Varki A. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4440-4455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in spin columns containing a 0.2-ml bed volume using similar elution conditions. Release of radiolabeled galactose from XylβMU products after β-galactosidase digestion was quantified by separation of the products using C18 spin columns. Mild acid hydrolysis to cleave sialic acids was carried out using 0.05 M HCl at 80°C for 30 min. Methanolysis to remove equatorial and axial sulfate esters was carried out as follows(29Green E.D. van Halbeek H. Boime I. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15623-15630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): The sample was dried in vacuo over P2O5, treated with 0.5 N methanolic HCl at room temperature for 5 h, and dried in vacuo over KOH pellets. Residual HCl was removed by repeated evaporation from methanol over KOH pellets. Methyl esters were hydrolyzed by treatment with 0.05 N NaOH for 30 min at room temperature followed by neutralization with HCl. A Golgi-enriched fraction from rat liver was prepared essentially as described by Hayes et al.(16Hayes B.K. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16139-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications (see “Experimental Procedures”). β1,4-Galactosyltransferase activity was used to monitor Golgi purification, and, as shown in Table 1, its specific activity increased ~ 100-fold with a 25-30% recovery. Since our approach depends on the absence of intervesicular transport to create freeze-frame glycosylation reactions, we also monitored lactate dehydrogenase activity as a measure of cytosolic contamination since cytoplasmic proteins are needed for intervesicular transport(32Ostermann J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Less than 0.02% of the total lactate dehydrogenase activity co-purified with the Golgi fraction. This low level of cytoplasmic contamination will not support intercompartmental transport. Moreover, we show that inhibitors of intercompartmental transport have no effect on the amount or types of products made (see below).Tabled 1 To further characterize the purification of the “functional” Golgi fraction, we monitored labeling of endogenous acceptors. This assay requires not only the galactosyltransferase activity, but also co-localized UDP-Gal transporter and endogenous acceptors. As shown in Table 1, this activity is enriched almost 1000-fold in the Golgi fraction, but not in other fractions from the sucrose gradient. We likewise assayed the various fractions for their ability to galactosylate XylβMU and found that only the classical Golgi fraction was active (Table 1). To demonstrate that the labeling depends on the transport and concentration of UDP-Gal in the lumen, a portion of the Golgi fraction was incubated (see “Experimental Procedures”) with 0.1% Triton X-100 to permeabilize the Golgi membranes. This reduced incorporation into endogenous acceptors 15-20-fold (data not shown)(16Hayes B.K. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16139-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also quantified the ability of the Golgi fraction to transport UDP-Gal as described by Perez and Hirschberg(26Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar): 187 pmol/mg of protein was transported in our standard incubation conditions (1 μM UDP-Gal, 15 min, pH 6.5 buffer). This compares well with a value of 372 pmol/mg of protein reported by Perez and Hirschberg (26Perez M. Hirschberg C.B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using different incubation conditions (2 μM UDP-Gal, 10 min, pH 7.5 buffer). Fig. 1 shows that the incorporation into endogenous acceptors occurs inside the Golgi lumen. Portions of one sample were incubated in the presence of Triton X-100 alone, Pronase alone, or Triton X-100 plus Pronase for 1 and 16 h. The results showed that the incorporated [3H]Gal was susceptible to Pronase digestion only if the Golgi was permeabilized with Triton X-100. The above results show that the Golgi preparations are intact, properly oriented, and that synthesis requires transportermediated delivery of sugar nucleotides into the lumen. The moderately hydrophobic 4-methylumbelliferyl group of XylβMU enables the xyloside to “diffuse” across membranes and serve as an alternate acceptor (and inhibitor) for GAG chain initiation(20Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1618-1627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lugemwa F.N. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6674-6677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hydrophobicity also facilitates binding to C18 reverse phase media(20Freeze H.H. Sampath D. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1618-1627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Palcic M.M. Heerze L.D. Pierce M. Hindsgaul O. Glycoconjugate J. 1988; 5: 49-63Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To characterize the xyloside products synthesized, we devised the fractionation scheme shown in Fig. 2 for the quantitative recovery of the xyloside products. The 70% ethanol-insoluble material from the supernatants (SPs) contained less than 0.5% of the incorporated [3H]galactose label and was not further analyzed. The 70% ethanol-soluble material from the Golgi pellets (XTs) and the insoluble material (XPs) were analyzed by gel filtration on Sephacryl 200 exactly as described by Hayes et al.(16Hayes B.K. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16139-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The XTs contained only low molecular weight material while the XPs contained only high molecular weight material eluting in or near the column void volume (data not shown). The 40% methanol eluates from the C18 reverse phase purification of the SE and XT fractions (SE40s and XT40s) contained"

These data indicate that thrombin receptor protein and mRNA expression can be regulated in homologous and heterologous ways by different mechanisms. Apart from its critical role in thrombosis and hemostasis, thrombin exhibits a variety of cell-activating functions(1Shuman M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 485: 228-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 2Fenton J.W. Semin. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 14: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) probably mediated by its guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein)1 coupled receptor(3Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar, 4Rasmussen U.B. Vouret-Craviari V. Jallat S. Schlesinger Y. Pages G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.-P. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Receptor activation occurs by cleavage of the amino-terminal extracellular domain by thrombin, exposing a new amino terminus that acts as a tethered peptide ligand and activates the receptor. Accordingly, thrombin receptor agonist peptides (TRAP), corresponding to the new amino terminus exposed, mimic receptor activation by thrombin(5Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-protein coupled receptors undergo rapid desensitization after short-time activation by an agonist that is reversible. However, after continuous exposure to agonist for several hours, long-term desensitization becomes evident as a down-regulation of total receptor number(6Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Down-regulation may occur in a homologous or heterologous way, that is, after chronic activation of the receptor by its agonist (7Sibley D.R. Benovicu J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 913-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) or after chronic activation of another receptor or process(8Lee N.H. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7949-7957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examples on the regulation of G-protein coupled receptors during cross-talk of signal transduction pathways are limited to adrenergic and muscarinic receptors(8Lee N.H. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7949-7957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Morris G.M. Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. J. Biol.

Two major signal transduction pathways activated by G-protein coupled receptors are stimulation of phospholipase C and adenylylcyclase, mediating cellular effects by activation of the effector kinases protein kinase C and protein kinase A, respectively. Many reports have indicated cross-talk between these two signaling pathways. Activation of one pathway has been shown to be stimulatory or inhibitory to the other pathway(11Hill S.J. Kendall D.A. Cell. Signalling. 1989; 1: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thrombin has been shown to regulate at least two second messenger pathways in a number of cell types. Thrombin stimulates phospholipase C and inhibits adenylylcyclase probably by activating Gq and Gi, respectively(12Huang D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.-K.H. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13LaMorte V.J. Harootunian A.T. Spiegel A.M. Tsien R.Y. Feramisco J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Additionally, thrombin interacts indirectly with other signal transduction pathways that may be involved in thrombin receptor regulation in a positive or negative feedback. Thrombin induces the synthesis of platelet-derived growth factor in vascular smooth muscle cells (14Kanthou C. Parry G. Wijelath E. Kakkar V.V. Demoliou-Mason C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells(15Daniel T.O. Gibbs V.C. Milfay D.F. Garavoy M.R. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9579-9582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of nerve growth factor in glial cells(16Neveu I. Jehan F. Jandrot-Perrus M. Wion D. Brachet P. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), of endothelin and vasopressin in epithelial cells(17Rennick R.E. Milner P. Burnstock G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 230: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the release of arachidonic acid followed by prostacyclin production in endothelial cells(18Weksler B.B. Ley C.W. Jaffe E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Less is known about the regulation of thrombin receptor expression. Basic fibroblast growth factor has been shown to increase thrombin receptor mRNA in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (19Zhong C. Hayzer D.J. Corson M.A. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16975-16979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a combination of phytohemagglutinin and PMA to decrease thrombin receptor mRNA in Jurkat T cells(20Mari B. Imbert V. Belhacene N. Far D.F. Peyron J.-F. Pouyssegur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Rossi B. Auberger P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8517-8523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nelken et al.(21Nelken N.A. Soifer S.J. O'Keefe J. Vu T.-K.H. Charo I.F. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1614-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) described altered thrombin receptor expression in atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. It has been difficult to study thrombin receptor protein expression by classical ligand binding techniques because thrombin binds with high affinity to cell surface proteins other than its receptor, and TRAP, the functional agonist, has only a low affinity for thrombin receptor (22Tiruppathi C. Lum H. Andersen T.T. Fenton J.W. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L595-L601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome these problems, a thrombin receptor-specific antibody has been used to establish a quantitative binding assay for thrombin receptor expression. Many experimental and human glomerulonephritides are associated with fibrin deposition, infiltration by inflammatory cells, and proliferation of intrinsic glomerular cells, possibly mediated by thrombin(23Kanfer A. Rondeau E. Peraldi M.N. Sraer J.D. Andreucci V.E. Fine L.G. International Yearbook of Nephrology. Springer International, London1991: 3-54Google Scholar). The presence of thrombin receptor protein and mRNA on human mesangial cells has recently been established, and the mechanisms of thrombin receptor internalization induced by thrombin, TRAP, and phorbol ester have been compared(24Zacharias U. He C.J. Hag é ge J. Xu Y. Sraer J.D. Brass L.F. Rondeau E. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to examine whether prolonged activation of protein kinase C or protein kinase A signaling pathways could regulate thrombin receptor mRNA and protein expression and to compare the mechanism of heterologous regulation to that of homologous regulation induced by thrombin and TRAP. We found that long-term activation of thrombin receptor by its agonists thrombin and TRAP results in homologous down-regulation of receptor protein after 24 h that is not dependent on protein kinase C and not accompanied by a change in thrombin receptor mRNA expression. Heterologous down-regulation of thrombin receptor protein is observed after treatment with PMA or after elevation of intracellular cAMP levels for 24 h. PMA-induced down-regulation is dependent on protein kinase C and paralleled by a partial inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression. Down-regulation induced by increasing the intracellular cAMP level, that is probably mediated by protein kinase A, leads to a dramatic inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression whereas it seems not to require previous internalization of thrombin receptor. The following materials have been obtained as indicated: amastatin, hirudin, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, PMA, collagenase type IV, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), prostaglandin E 1 (PGE1), forskolin, and purified human α-thrombin (3000 units/mg, 1 unit/ml = 10 -8 M) from Sigma; 125 I-sodium (17 Ci/mg) from Dupont de Nemours (France); protein assay regent from Bio-Rad (Germany); and Sephadex G-25 from Pharmacia (Schweden). TRAP and GF 109 203 X were kindly provided by Dr. S. Seiler (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and by Dr. J. Kirilovsky (Glaxo, France), respectively. Ascites and purified monoclonal anti-human thrombin receptor antibody ATAP2, made against a peptide sequence of the tethered ligand domain (25Brass L.F. Vassallo Jr., R.R. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used for antibody binding assay. Purified antibody ATAP2 was radioiodinated by the IODOGEN method(26Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mCi of 125 I-sodium was allowed to react with 50 μg of IODOGEN, before addition of 30 μg of antibody ATAP2, and the mixture was kept on ice for 30 min. Free 125 I was separated from labeled antibody on a Sephadex G-25 column saturated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and extensively washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20. Glomerular mesangial cells were obtained by collagenase digestion of isolated glomeruli derived from human kidneys judged to be unsuitable for transplantation. They were purified and identified by their morphologic and functional features as described previously(27Lacave R. Rondeau E. Ochi S. Delarue F. Schleuning W.D. Sraer J.D. Kidney Int. 1989; 35: 806-811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed between the third and the fifth subculture of mesangial cells grown in multidish wells (Nunclon, Nunc) in normally defined medium as described(28Villamediana L.M. Rondeau E. He C.J. Medcalf R. Peraldi M.N. Lacave R. Delarue F. Sraer J.D. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 956-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When reaching confluence, cells were washed, growth-arrested by serum starvation for 24 h, and incubated with the compound to be tested. To avoid degradation of TRAP, all experiments using TRAP were performed in the presence of 10 μM amastatin(29Zacharias U. He C.J. Nguyen G. Sraer J.D. Rondeau E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Serum-starved mesangial cells were exposed to various agonists for 24 h at 37°C. Total RNA was extracted by the phenol-chloroform method as described (30Meulders Q. He C.J. Adida C. Peraldi M.N. Schleuning W.D. Sraer J.D. Rondeau E. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and precipitated by 3 M LiCl. Total RNA (5 μg/lane) was separated by electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gel containing 20% formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus). Hybridization was performed using a 32 P-labeled human 872-base pair cDNA probe specific for thrombin receptor that has been prepared by polymerase chain reaction according to Vu et al.(3Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were developed after 24 to 72 h. After dehybridization by boiling, the filter was rehybridized with a 32 P-labeled 412-base pair glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe obtained by polymerase chain reaction according to Tokunaga et al.(31Tokunaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakata K. Fujimori K. Ohkubo M. Sawada K. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5616-5619PubMed Google Scholar). Human mesangial cells, cultivated in 96-well plates and serum-starved, were exposed to various agonists for the indicated times at 37°C and immediately transferred on ice to terminate reactions. The following steps were performed on ice. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM CaCl2 and, for some experiments, permeabilized by treatment with methanol for 1 min. Plates were incubated with radioiodinated antibody ATAP2 (35,000 cpm/well corresponding to 2.5 ng of ATAP2/well) in minimally defined medium containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA, cells were solubilized by incubation with 1 N NaOH at room temperature for 10 min. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured in a γ -counter. An aliquot was used for protein determination using protein assay reagent from Bio-Rad (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar) and BSA as a standard. Antibody binding data were expressed as specific binding (total minus nonspecific binding). Typically, binding of untreated cells was about 1250 cpm/well corresponding to 105,000 cpm/mg of protein and was set at 100%. Nonspecific binding in the presence of 1 μM TRAP 14 was less than 5%. Antibody ATAP2, that is directed against the tethered ligand domain of thrombin receptor amino terminus and recognizes intact and thrombin-cleaved receptor(25Brass L.F. Vassallo Jr., R.R. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Hoxie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hoxie J.A. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Pizarro S. Parton R. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been used to establish a quantitative binding assay for thrombin receptor expression (see “Experimental Procedures”). Permeabilization of cells with methanol prior to antibody binding allowed differentiation between surface-expressed and total thrombin receptor antigen. Using this binding assay, the effects of thrombin and TRAP on thrombin receptor expression on mesangial cells have been studied. After persistent activation of thrombin receptor for 24 h, thrombin (Fig. 1A) and TRAP (Fig. 1B) induced a dose-dependent loss of cell surface binding sites for antibody ATAP2 to 27% and 29% of control, respectively. In parallel, the total number of ATAP2 binding sites as revealed after cell permeabilization was reduced to 39% and 37% of control at maximal doses of thrombin and TRAP, respectively. Chemically inactivated thrombin by treatment with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (28Villamediana L.M. Rondeau E. He C.J. Medcalf R. Peraldi M.N. Lacave R. Delarue F. Sraer J.D. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 956-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or thrombin in the presence of hirudin, a known inhibitor of thrombin(34Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), failed to elicit receptor down-regulation. Binding of an antibody directed against the plasma membrane-associated urokinase receptor (35Ronne E. Behendt N. Ellis V. Ploug M. Dano K. Hoyer-Hansen G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was unaffected (not shown). PMA, a known activator of protein kinase C (36Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has recently been shown to induce heterologous internalization of thrombin receptor after short-time exposure to mesangial cells(24Zacharias U. He C.J. Hag é ge J. Xu Y. Sraer J.D. Brass L.F. Rondeau E. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar). After persistent treatment for 24 h, PMA induced a dose-dependent decrease in antibody ATAP2 binding sites on intact and permeabilized cells to 20% and 32% of control, respectively (Fig. 2), suggesting down-regulation of total thrombin receptor protein. Thrombin receptor down-regulation by PMA points to a possible role of protein kinase C in this process. A specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, GF 109 203X(37Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been used to test this hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 3, thrombin receptor down-regulation induced by PMA was inhibited by GF 109 203X in a dose-dependent manner. Almost complete inhibition was observed with 5 μM GF 109 203 X. In contrast, the protein kinase C inhibitor did not antagonize thrombin receptor down-regulation induced by thrombin (Fig. 3) and TRAP (not shown), suggesting that protein kinase C-dependent and protein kinase C-independent mechanisms are involved in thrombin receptor down-regulation induced by PMA and thrombin, respectively. PGE1 increased the intracellular level of cAMP in mesangial cells by activating adenylylcyclase via its receptor coupled to Gs. In contrast to thrombin, TRAP, and PMA, that induced rapid internalization of thrombin receptor within 15 min and 1 h(24Zacharias U. He C.J. Hag é ge J. Xu Y. Sraer J.D. Brass L.F. Rondeau E. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar), respectively, short-time exposure of mesangial cells to PGE1 did not change cell surface expression of thrombin receptor, indicating that PGE1 did not induce thrombin receptor internalization (Fig. 4A). However, after exposure for more than 12 h to PGE1, cell-surface thrombin receptor protein declined, suggesting down-regulation of thrombin receptor protein by PGE1. After 24 h, PGE1 reduced the expression of cell surface and total thrombin receptor protein in a dose-dependent manner to 41% and 54% of control, respectively (Fig. 4B). To determine the mechanism of PGE1-induced down-regulation of thrombin receptor, the effect of other agents known to elevate intracellular cAMP has been compared to PGE1. Forskolin, a direct stimulator of adenylylcyclase, IBMX, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, and 8-Br-cAMP, a cell-permeable cAMP analogue, induced a dose-dependent down-regulation of thrombin receptor protein after 24 h (Fig. 5), suggesting that thrombin receptor down-regulation induced by PGE1 was mediated by cAMP and occurred probably via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. The presence of specific mRNA encoding the functional thrombin receptor in mesangial cells has recently been demonstrated. In order to determine whether down-regulation of thrombin receptor occurs at the protein and/or mRNA level, the effect of thrombin, PMA, and PGE1 on thrombin receptor mRNA expression after stimulation of mesangial cells for 24 h has been compared by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6, exposure to thrombin did not change thrombin receptor mRNA expression, suggesting that increased degradation of thrombin receptor protein was responsible for homologous down-regulation. In contrast, PMA decreased thrombin receptor mRNA expression partially to 51% of control, indicating that PMA-induced heterologous down-regulation was in part due to reduced thrombin receptor mRNA expression and in part to increased degradation of thrombin receptor protein. PGE1, however, led to a dramatic decrease in thrombin receptor mRNA expression to 24% of control, suggesting that heterologous down-regulation by elevation of intracellular cAMP was mediated by a strong inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression rather than by affecting thrombin receptor protein degradation. Whether the reduction in thrombin receptor mRNA by PMA and PGE1 was due to reduced transcription rate or decreased mRNA stability remains to be elucidated. Reduction in total receptor number after continuous exposure to agonist, termed down-regulation, is one mechanism of regulating the function of G-protein-coupled receptors by inducing long-term desensitization. Down-regulation is a slow process that occurs over many hours and may not be maximal before 24 h of continuous agonist exposure. Down-regulation is possible at the level of transcription, mRNA stability, and protein degradation(6Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Homologous down-regulation has been studied most extensively for adrenergic receptors and seems to be independent of receptor phosphorylation, rapid desensitization, and receptor internalization (38Hausdorff W.P.

Domains, crucial for receptor down-regulation, have been identified in the third intracellular loop (40Campbell P.T. Hnatowich M. O'Dowd B.F. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 192-198PubMed Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail (41Valiquette M. Bonin H. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5089-5093Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) of β2-adrenergic receptor. Additionally, proteins binding specifically to and destabilizing β2-adrenergic receptor mRNA have recently been identified (42Port J.D. Huang L.-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24103-24108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Less well characterized is the down-regulation of G-protein-coupled receptors during cross-talk between different signal transduction pathways. Tumor-promoting phorbol esters like PMA directly activate protein kinase C and have been shown to down-regulate adrenergic receptor mRNA and protein (43Colucci W.S. Gimbrone M.A. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1986; 58: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 44Izzo N.J. Tulenko T.N. Colucci W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1705-1710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to destabilize muscarinic receptor mRNA(45Lee N.H. Earle-Hughes J. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4291-4298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Persistent activation of the adenylylcyclase pathway leads to heterologous down-regulation of muscarinic receptor protein(8Lee N.H. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7949-7957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There appear to be distinct and independent pathways underlying thrombin receptor down-regulation. Homologous and heterologous down-regulation induced by thrombin, PMA, and PGE1, respectively, have been studied in detail. Homologous down-regulation of thrombin receptor by TRAP occurs similar to thrombin and suggests that activation rather than proteolysis of the receptor is the signal for down-regulation. Homologous down-regulation of thrombin receptor protein is not accompanied by a change in thrombin receptor mRNA expression, suggesting that increased degradation of thrombin receptor protein is responsible for down-regulation of total receptor number. One pathway of heterologous down-regulation, evoked by PMA, is dependent on activation of protein kinase C as shown by sensitivity to protein kinase C inhibitor GF 109 203 X and is mediated at least in part by inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression. In parallel, direct activation of protein kinase C by PMA leads to heterologous phosphorylation(46Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), desensitization(47Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6044-6050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and internalization (24Zacharias U. He C.J. Hag é ge J. Xu Y. Sraer J.D. Brass L.F. Rondeau E. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; (in press)Google Scholar) of thrombin receptor in different cells. Homologous down-regulation by receptor agonists thrombin and TRAP, however, is not dependent on protein kinase C. Likewise, homologous thrombin receptor desensitization and internalization have been shown to occur independent of activation of protein kinase C and endothelin and vasopressin, which share common second messenger pathways with thrombin and activate protein kinase C, do not induce down-regulation of thrombin receptor protein (not shown). Activation of protein kinase C by thrombin via phosphoinositide hydrolysis and diacylglycerol formation, however, is necessary for thrombin-induced cellular effects in human mesangial cells(28Villamediana L.M. Rondeau E. He C.J. Medcalf R. Peraldi M.N. Lacave R. Delarue F. Sraer J.D. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 956-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Additionally, growth factors like platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor did not affect thrombin receptor protein expression in human mesangial cells (not shown). It should be noted that long-term effects of PMA are not restricted to down-regulation of protein kinase C and experiments using PMA with this purpose should be interpreted with caution. Reduced cellular sensitivity to thrombin after a 24-h pretreatment with PMA may be due to down-regulation of protein kinase C and/or to a reduction in thrombin receptor number. Heterologous down-regulation of thrombin receptor by PGE1 is mediated by elevation of intracellular cAMP because it can be mimicked by 8-Br-cAMP, a cell-permeable cAMP analogue, by forskolin, a direct activator of adenylylcyclase, and by IBMX, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, and is probably mediated via cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Heterologous down-regulation of thrombin receptor protein by PGE1 is caused by a dramatic inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression. In contrast to thrombin, TRAP, and PMA, elevation of cAMP does not induce thrombin receptor internalization, confirming that receptor internalization is not a prerequisite for receptor down-regulation. Likewise, mutations in different regions of the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain of β2-adrenergic receptor result in mutants that are abolished in their sequestration but down-regulate normally(38Hausdorff W.P. Campbell P.T. Ostrowski J. Yu S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2979-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 39Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of thrombin receptor by elevation of cAMP may be an explanation for the observed inhibitory effects of long-term treatment with 8-Br-cAMP and forskolin on thrombin-induced cellular effects like proliferation and synthesis of proteins of the fibrinolytic system in glomerular epithelial cells(48He C.J. Peraldi M.N. Adida C. Rebibou J.M. Meulders Q. Sraer J.D. Rondeau E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the lack of thrombin receptor expression is accompanied by a loss of thrombin responsiveness. This could also indicate a new therapeutical approach for fibrin-associated glomerular diseases in which pharmacological modulation of thrombin receptor on glomerular cells could suppress the effects of thrombin on cell proliferation and matrix remodeling. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that thrombin receptor undergoes homologous and heterologous down-regulation in response to thrombin, PMA, and PGE1, respectively. Different mechanisms are involved in down-regulation including activation of effector kinases, inhibition of thrombin receptor mRNA expression, and increased degradation of thrombin receptor protein. The present work provides new insights for studying the underlying mechanisms of regulation of thrombin receptor. The diverse cellular actions of thrombin and the potential for modulation of thrombin receptor expression in various tissues underline the importance of defining the mechanisms by which thrombin receptor is regulated. thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP 7 = SFLLRNP) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate guanine nucleotide-binding protein bovine serum albumin prostaglandin E1 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine 8-bromo-cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2008661593,"Abstract A rat pituitary tumor cell line (GH3) has been reported to express transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) binding components of 70-74 kDa (ligand included), denoted TGF-β type IV receptor. We investigated whether the type IV receptor corresponds to any of the recently cloned type I receptors for proteins in the TGF-β superfamily. TGF-β type I receptor (TβR-I) complexes of 69-72 kDa formed a heteromeric complex with TβR-II in GH3 cells, as detected by immunoprecipitation. In addition, TGF-β formed complexes of 72-74 kDa, which were different from TβR-I and the other known type I receptors, and were not dependent on TβR-II for binding. The GH3 cells were resistant to the growth inhibitory activity of TGF-β, but a transcriptional response was activated by TGF-β in this cell line, presumably through the TβR-II and TβR-I complex. These results indicate that GH3 cells have TβR-I and TβR-II and, in addition, other binding protein(s) which form 72-74-kDa complexes with TGF-β; the function of the latter component(s) remains to be elucidated."

The results supported a model in which the methyltransferase enzyme contacts a residue seven amino acids to the C terminus of a site being methylated. The presence of a negatively charged residue at that position inhibits methylation, whereas a neutral residue has no effect. Methylation sites in the wild type receptor may also influence the methylation of other sites which are 7 residues away through a physical contact with the methyltransferase.

https://openalex.org/W2077743540,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA) is a member of the family of bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins which use NAD+ as the ADP-ribose donor. By analogy to diphtheria and pertussis toxins, the His440 residue of ETA has been proposed to be one of the critical residues within the active site of the toxin. In this study the role of the His440 residue was explored through site-directed mutagenesis which resulted in the production of ETA proteins containing Ala, Asn, and Phe substitutions at the 440 position. The His440-substituted ETA proteins were purified and analyzed. All substitutions at the 440 site displayed severely reduced ADP-ribosylation activity (> 1000-fold). However, NAD glycohydrolase activity remained intact and in the case of ETAH440N actually increased 10-fold. NAD+ binding is not affected by substitutions at the 440 site as indicated by similar Km values for the ETA variants tested. Conformational integrity of the mutant toxins appears to be largely unaffected as assessed by analysis with a conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibody as well as sensitivity to proteinase digestion. In view of the location of His440 residue within or close to the proposed NAD(+)-binding site, these results suggest that His440 may be a catalytic residue involved in the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety to the EF-2 substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1983619275,"15N NMR, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry have been used to follow nitrogen metabolism in Escherichia coli labeled on medium containing L-[15N]aspartate. The flow of 15N through various nitrogen-containing metabolites was followed over the course of the labeling period. For wild-type E. coli labeled on L-[15N]aspartate as sole source of nitrogen, significant 15N labeling was detected only in the intracellular L-glutamate, L-alanine, L-aspartate, and putrescine pools. Intracellular concentrations of L-aspartate and L-glutamate differed significantly in extracts of an arginine auxotroph (argG-), which is deficient in a potential aspartate-assimilating reaction. When the L-[15N]aspartate containing labeling medium was supplemented with unlabeled arginine, extracts of wild-type E. coli were shown to contain significant amounts of unlabeled ammonia and putrescine. There was substantial dilution of 15N in the glutamate pool. The observation that glutamate, aspartate, and alanine are 15N-labeled, but ammonia is not, suggests that these amino acids are not the immediate source of ammonia. Our results suggest that arginine may be an intermediate for the degradation of some of the aspartate and that arginine may be an intermediate for ammonia production during nitrogen-limited growth. Our results also strongly suggest the presence of a previously uncharacterized pathway of arginine degradation."
