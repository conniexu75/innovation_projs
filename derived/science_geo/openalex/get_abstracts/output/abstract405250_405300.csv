Recent studies show that TDG, including its glycosylase activity, is essential for active DNA demethylation and embryonic development. These and other findings suggest that active demethylation could involve mC deamination by a deaminase, giving a G·T mispair followed by TDG-initiated BER. An alternative proposal is that demethylation could involve iterative oxidation of mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) and then to 5-formylcytosine (fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (caC), mediated by a Tet (ten eleven translocation) enzyme, with conversion of caC to C by a putative decarboxylase. Our previous studies suggest that TDG could excise fC and caC from DNA, which could provide another potential demethylation mechanism. We show here that TDG rapidly removes fC, with higher activity than for G·T mispairs, and has substantial caC excision activity, yet it cannot remove hmC. TDG excision of fC and caC, oxidation products of mC, is consistent with its strong specificity for excising bases from a CpG context. Our findings reveal a remarkable new aspect of specificity for TDG, inform its catalytic mechanism, and suggest that TDG could protect against fC-induced mutagenesis. The results also suggest a new potential mechanism for active DNA demethylation, involving TDG excision of Tet-produced fC (or caC) and subsequent BER. Such a mechanism obviates the need for a decarboxylase and is consistent with findings that TDG glycosylase activity is essential for active demethylation and embryonic development, as are mechanisms involving TDG excision of deaminated mC or hmC.

https://openalex.org/W2123431656,"Chitin is an abundant polysaccharide found in fungal cell walls, crustacean shells, and insect exoskeletons. The immunological properties of both chitin and its deacetylated derivative chitosan are of relevance because of frequent natural exposure and their use in medical applications. Depending on the preparation studied and the end point measured, these compounds have been reported to induce allergic responses, inflammatory responses, or no response at all. We prepared highly purified chitosan and chitin and examined the capacity of these glycans to stimulate murine macrophages to release the inflammasome-associated cytokine IL-1β. We found that although chitosan was a potent NLRP3 inflammasome activator, acetylation of the chitosan to chitin resulted in a near total loss of activity. The size of the chitosan particles played an important role, with small particles eliciting the greatest activity. An inverse relationship between size and stimulatory activity was demonstrated using chitosan passed through size exclusion filters as well as with chitosan-coated beads of defined size. Partial digestion of chitosan with pepsin resulted in a larger fraction of small phagocytosable particles and more potent inflammasome activity. Inhibition of phagocytosis with cytochalasin D abolished the IL-1β stimulatory activity of chitosan, offering an explanation for why the largest particles were nearly devoid of activity. Thus, the deacetylated polysaccharide chitosan potently activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in a phagocytosis-dependent manner. In contrast, chitin is relatively inert.

It is also an essential component of fungal cell walls and some parasites, including helminths and protozoa (4Fuhrman J.A. Piessens W.F. Mol. Biochem.

Chitosan is not as prevalent naturally, although some medically important fungi, particularly Cryptococcus neoformans and members of the Zygomycetes, contain chitin deacetylases that promote conversion of chitin to chitosan (8Bartnicki-Garcia S.

Exposure to these polysaccharides also occurs as a result of their use in a wide variety of pharmaceutical and commercial applications (10Jayakumar R. Prabaharan M. Nair S.V. Tamura H. Biotechnol.

Most commercial preparations of chitin and chitosan are derived from crustacean shells. In addition to putative contaminants, these polymers are unlikely to be homogeneous. Methods to isolate and purify chitin generally result in partial deacetylation of the polymer, whereas some acetylation remains following the heat-alkali treatment used typically (13Aranaz I. Mengibar M. Harris R. Panos I. Miralles B. Acosta N. Galed G. Heras A. Curr. Chem. Biol. 2009; 3: 203-230Google Scholar). Thus, most marketed chitin and chitosan consist of both acetylated (GlcNAc) and deacetylated (GlcN) residues. Generally, a polymer that is at least 60% deacetylated and soluble in weak acid is considered to be chitosan (13Aranaz I. Mengibar M. Harris R. Panos I. Miralles B. Acosta N. Galed G. Heras A. Curr. Chem. Biol. 2009; 3: 203-230Google Scholar). Chitin is insoluble in both acid and base. Despite the prevalence of chitin and chitosan, their immunostimulatory properties are poorly understood. Varying reports have characterized these polysaccharides as relatively inert, proinflammatory, and proallergenic (14Lee C.G. Da Silva C.A. Lee J.Y. Hartl D. Elias J.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 15Reese T.A. Liang H.E. Tager A.M. Luster A.D. Van Rooijen N. Voehringer D. Locksley R.M.

Myrvik Q.N. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Possible explanations for these disparate findings include different sources (e.g. shrimp, crab, fungal) and manufacturing processes utilized to make the glycans, resulting in variability in the tertiary structure of the polymers and in the degree of contaminants (13Aranaz I. Mengibar M. Harris R. Panos I. Miralles B. Acosta N. Galed G. Heras A. Curr. Chem. Biol. 2009; 3: 203-230Google Scholar, 19Mora-Montes H.M. Netea M.G. Ferwerda G. Lenardon M.D. Brown G.D. Mistry A.R.

Chitin is frequently isolated from crustacean waste products and is naturally associated with protein and minerals that are difficult to remove. Purification by deproteinization followed by demineralization will likely destroy the native structure (13Aranaz I. Mengibar M. Harris R. Panos I. Miralles B. Acosta N. Galed G. Heras A. Curr. Chem. Biol. 2009; 3: 203-230Google Scholar). Another possible explanation for the varied immunological response is particle size. The importance of size has been suggested by studies demonstrating differential stimulation of TNFα and IL-10 by size-fractionated chitin. Particles of intermediate size (40–70 μm) induced just TNFα, whereas smaller particles (<40 μm) induced both TNFα and IL-10 (20Da Silva C.A. Chalouni C. Williams A. Hartl D. Lee C.G. Elias J.A. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 3573-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The inflammasome is a cytosolic complex containing, in most cases, a Nod-like receptor (NLR), the adaptor molecule: apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a card (ASC) and caspase-1 (21Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar). It is responsible for the processing and release of IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-33. Inflammasome activation involves a two-signal process, with the first signal generally provided by a Toll-like receptor agonist, such as LPS, inducing up-regulation of pro-IL-1β. The second signal cleaves inactive pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1 in the inflammasome complex, activating the complex to process and release mature IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-33 (22Franchi L. Eigenbrod T. Muñoz-Planillo R. Nuñez G. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 23Meylan E. Tschopp J. Karin M. Nature. 2006; 442: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). A wide variety of stimuli has been shown to activate the inflammasome, including particulates such as alum, chitosan, uric acid crystals, and silica (24Dostert C. Pétrilli V. Van Bruggen R. Steele C.

The NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome is the most well studied of the inflammasomes and also the one with the most known activators. In this study, we subjected chitin and chitosan to vigorous purification and size fractionation procedures. We then studied the immunological activity of the resulting preparations using inflammasome activation as the readout. We found that chitosan, but not chitin, is a potent NLRP3 inflammasome activator. Moreover, phagocytosis of the particles is necessary for inflammasome activation. All materials were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated. Ultrapure LPS (free of TLR2-stimulating lipopeptides) was purified from the original Sigma stock (L2630) by two treatments with deoxycholate followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation (31Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. The Journal of Immunology. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Chitosan (76% deacetylated) was obtained from Primex. Chitin and chitosan hexamers were purchased from Associates of Cape Cod and used at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Complete media is defined as RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Tissue Culture Biologicals), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell culture was performed at 37 °C in humidified air supplemented with 5% CO2. All experiments were performed under conditions designed to minimize endotoxin contamination. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMΦ) were generated as described (32Johnson C.R. Kitz D. Little J.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow was extracted from the femurs and tibiae of WT C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory) or NLRP3−/− mice (33Kanneganti T.D. Ozören N. Body-Malapel M. Amer A. Park J.H. Franchi L.

Nature. 2006; 440: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) (originally from Millennium Pharmaceuticals and supplied to us by Dr. Katherine Fitzgerald, University of Massachusetts Medical School). Cells were cultured in complete media supplemented with supernatant from macrophage colony-stimulating factor-secreting L929 fibroblasts at a final concentration of 20% and fed on days 4 and 7 with fresh media containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor. On day 8, macrophages were treated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, harvested, and washed once in complete media before use in experiments. Chitosan was suspended (6 g/80 ml) in 1.0 m sodium hydroxide and heated at 90 °C for 1 h. The chitosan was collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS until the pH was neutralized. Half of the purified chitosan was converted to chitin by suspending it in 20 ml of 1.0 m sodium bicarbonate followed by addition of 1 ml 97% acetic anhydride (Acros). The acetylation reaction was performed at 22 °C for 20 min with periodic mixing. The acetylated glycan was collected by centrifugation and further acetylated by suspension in fresh sodium bicarbonate and acetic anhydride (as described above) for 20 min at 22 °C followed by 10 min at 100 °C. The particles were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with PBS. Both the chitin and chitosan preparations were then passed through a 100-μm nylon mesh filter basket (BD Falcon) to remove the largest particles. The preparations were further treated in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide at 22 °C for 30 min as a final purification procedure, followed by washing twice with PBS. Samples were stored at 4 °C in PBS. Reacetylated chitosan was digested to monosaccharides with chitinase followed by their separation using TLC. To 1 mg of chitin suspended in 200 μl of MacIlvaine's citrate phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) were added 10 μl of Trichoderma viride chitinase (5 mg/ml in PBS). Following incubation at 30 °C for 5 days, samples and standards (5 μl) were spotted on a silica gel 60 glass-backed plate (EMD Chemicals) and developed using n-butanol:ethanol:water:acetic acid (5:4:3:1). Standards were GlcNAc and GlcN at various concentrations ranging from 1–20 mm. Plates were sprayed with 30% (w/v) ammonium hydrogen sulfate (Acros Organics) in water and then baked at 140 °C for 30 min. The spraying and baking were repeated two more times (34Gal A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 24: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Visualizing the separated sugars was done with epi-UV illumination and a FluorChem HD2 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech). Quantifications of the digital images were done with ImageJ. BMMΦ were plated 1 × 105 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Cells were primed with 100 ng/ml ultrapure LPS for 3 h (control cells were left unprimed), followed by incubation with the stimuli for 1–6 h. Stimuli controls were alum (Imject), synthetic double-stranded DNA: poly(dA:dT), and nigericin. Supernatants were collected for cytokine measurement, assayed by IL-1β ELISA (eBiosciences). Cytochalasin D (1 mg/ml stock solution dissolved in chloroform) was added 30 min prior to stimuli addition for the phagocytosis inhibition assays and utilized at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. BMMΦ were plated at 1.5 × 106 cells/well in a 12-well plate. Cells were primed with 200 ng/ml LPS for 3 h, followed by incubation with the indicated stimuli for 6 h. Supernatants were collected and proteins precipitated by methanol-chloroform extraction as described (35Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H. Rock K.L. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described (35Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H. Rock K.L. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) using anti-mouse caspase-1 (clone 5B10, eBioscience) and anti-mouse IL-1β (AF-401-NA, R&D Systems). Chitosan (250 mg) was dissolved by rotating overnight at 37 °C in 25 ml 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5). Pepsin (Sigma, P7000) was added to a final concentration of 100 units/ml followed by rotating the sample at 37 °C for 18 h. Five ml 24:1 (v/v) chloroform:isoamyl alcohol were added and mixed by vortexing for 30 s. The phases were separated by centrifugation, and 20 ml of the aqueous layer were removed. Next, 20 ml 12% potassium hydroxide were added, which precipitated the chitosan, and the sample was heated at 80 °C for 90 min. The digested, insoluble chitosan was washed three times with 40 ml of water followed by PBS and stored at 4 °C. Chitosan that had been digested with pepsin as above was dissolved in 10 mm acetic acid (2 mg/ml) and then diluted 1:100 in complete media and immediately added to cells at a final concentration of 0.01 mg/ml. Undissolved (insoluble) chitosan was used as a control. Chitosan and chitin particles in PBS were subjected to three rounds of sonication using a microtip probe at 30% power for 5 min in PBS. Particles were first filtered through a 100-μm nylon mesh basket filter (BD Falcon). Particles that did not pass through that filter were collected for the >100 μm fraction. The filtrate was then further fractionated through a 20-μm nylon mesh filter (Millipore) to create the <20 μm fraction. Particles retained on the filter were collected and designated the 20- to 100-μm fraction. Uncoated, chitin-coated, and chitosan-coated polystyrene beads with diameters of 3 μm and 50 μm were from Micromod and New England Biolabs. The chitosan beads were converted to chitin beads with acetic anhydride. Briefly, the beads were washed sequentially with water:methanol; first with 70:30 (v/v), then 50:50, then 30:70, and finally 0:100. An equal volume of acetic anhydride:methanol (50:50, v/v) was added to the beads followed by rocking for 2 h at 22 °C. The beads were washed in reverse order with the water:methanol mixtures and finally five times with water. All beads were stored at 4 °C. Where indicated, chitin and chitosan preparations were suspended in 200 μl PBS at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The tubes were then sonicated for 5 min using a horn sonicator (S-4000, Misonix, Inc.) at 20% amplitude. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Significance was assessed by either two-way-ANOVA or two-tailed unpaired t test as indicated. p values of < 0.05 after the Bonferroni correction were considered significant. Chitosan was suspended in 1.0 m NaOH at 90 °C for 1 h to remove possible contaminants (Fig. 1A). In particular, NaOH destroys bacterial endotoxin while having no effect on the chitosan polymer itself (13Aranaz I. Mengibar M. Harris R. Panos I. Miralles B. Acosta N. Galed G. Heras A. Curr. Chem. Biol. 2009; 3: 203-230Google Scholar, 36Somlyo B. Csanky E. Shi X.M. Zhang Y.L. Kovats E. Bona-Liptak E. Nowotny A.M. Tripodi D. Nowotny A. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1992; 14: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After this purification step, half the chitosan sample was suspended in 1 m sodium bicarbonate and acetic anhydride to acetylate the chitosan to chitin (9Banks I.R. Specht C.A. Donlin M.J. Gerik K.J. Levitz S.M. Lodge J.K. Eukaryotic Cell. 2005; 4: 1902-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), resulting in preparations that only differ in their degree of acetylation. Both glycan preparations were then incubated with NaOH (0.1 m) to destroy any endotoxin that might have been introduced during the conversion or handling processes and to remove any O-acetyl groups added during acetylation. To analyze the efficiency of the acetylation reaction, the chitin was digested with chitinase followed by separation of GlcNAc and GlcN by TLC (Fig. 1B). The acetylation proved successful, with only about 7% of the residues remaining deacetylated. Mouse BMMΦ were primed for 3 h with 100 ng/ml ultrapure LPS and then stimulated with the pure chitosan and chitin preparations generated as in Fig. 1A. Supernatants were assayed for IL-1β as a measure of inflammasome activation. As reported previously (27Li H. Willingham S.B. Ting J.P. Re F. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), chitosan stimulated IL-1β (Fig. 2A). However, surprisingly, macrophages released only scant amounts of IL-1β when stimulated with chitin. IL-1β stimulation by chitosan was dose-dependent, with peak stimulation seen at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml (Fig. 2B). Inflammasome activation by chitosan was dependent upon the NLRP3 inflammasome as IL-1β was not detected in supernatants of chitosan-stimulated macrophages from NLRP3−/−mice (Fig. 2C). IL-1β release from NLRP3-deficient macrophages was severely reduced in response to alum, which is known to predominantly activate this inflammasome, but remained intact in response to the AIM2 inflammasome activator poly(dA:dT). Next we examined the influence of particle size on the capacity of chitin and chitosan to stimulate IL-1β. Accordingly, we sonicated the chitosan and chitin preparations to generate smaller particles and then size-fractionated the preparations by sequential passage through 100-μm and 20-μm filters. This resulted in fractions with predicted sizes of <20 μm, 20–100 μm, and >100 μm. These three fractions were then compared with the sonicated but unfractionated polysaccharides for their ability to stimulate IL-1β release from primed macrophages (Fig. 3A). Chitosan induced the most IL-1β from the <20 fraction, with the >100 fraction eliciting only low amounts of IL-1β. This suggests that smaller chitosan particles are primarily responsible for inducing IL-1β. The low amount of activity in the >100 fraction may have been due, at least in part, to the presence of some smaller particles that were retained by the filter despite washing. Although greatly reduced compared with chitosan and the positive control alum, the sonicated preparations of chitin did induce some IL-1β. One possible explanation for this activity is that sonication broke apart large particles of chitin that had cores of chitosan that were inaccessible to the acetylation reaction. Upon sonication, these particles were broken apart, exposing their inner chitosan, which then was able to activate IL-1β. To address this and further study the influence of particle size, we used 3- and 50-μm polystyrene beads that were coated with chitin or chitosan. This provided a uniform particle size and glycan surface. Uncoated polystyrene beads served as additional controls. Uncoated beads and chitin-coated beads stimulated little IL-1β activity (Fig. 3B). However, the 3-μm beads coated with chitosan elicited a strong IL-1β response. None of the 50-μm beads, regardless of their surface, stimulated macrophage IL-1β release. Both the chitin and chitosan 3-μm beads were readily phagocytosed by macrophages (Fig. 3, C and D), whereas the 50-μm beads were too large to be phagocytosed (data not shown). These data provide further support for the concept that chitosan, but not chitin, potently stimulates IL-1β via a size-dependent mechanism. As an alternative way to examine the effect of particle size, we took advantage of the ability of pepsin to partially digest chitosan (37Roncal T. Oviedo A. López de Armentia I. Fernández L. Villarán M.C. Carbohydr. Res. 2007; 342: 2750-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Following the procedure outlined in Fig. 4A, chitosan was digested with pepsin. Upon digestion, the thick, viscous chitosan solution became much less viscous, suggesting a successful digestion. After the digestion, the chitosan was chloroform-extracted to remove the pepsin and other possible contaminants. The chitosan was then precipitated, and half was converted to chitin. Both glycans were then assayed for their ability to activate the inflammasome by measuring release of IL-1β activity (Fig. 4B). The digested chitosan was a potent IL-1β activator, with peak activity again seen at 0.3 mg/ml. Once again, chitin was nearly inert. Chitosan, but not chitin, stimulated cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β to the mature form of IL-1β (Fig. 4C). Regardless of whether prepared as in Fig. 1A (NaOH) or Fig. 4A (pepsin), both chitin and chitosan particles aggregate when left to stand over time, although the average size of the glycans produced through the method used in Fig. 4A was smaller. We next studied whether breaking up the aggregates with sonication affected the ability of the glycans to stimulate the inflammasome. Mild sonication in a horn sonicator did not significantly affect IL-1β release in response to the NaOH preparations, but there was a significant increase in IL-1β activity after sonication of the pepsin-digested chitosan preparation (Fig. 4D). Neither chitin preparation induced more IL-1β after mild sonication. We tested whether chitin's inability to induce IL-1β was because it does not activate the inflammasome or because it actively suppresses the inflammasome (Fig. 4E). Macrophages were preincubated with 0.1 mg/ml pepsin-digested chitin and then stimulated with alum, chitosan or nigericin (an ionophore which stimulates the inflammasome independently of phagocytosis (24Dostert C. Pétrilli V. Van Bruggen R. Steele C. Mossman B.T. Tschopp J. Science. 2008; 320: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar)). We found that chitin was unable to inhibit IL-1β release by any of these stimuli. We next studied whether soluble chitin and chitosan hexamers stimulate the inflammasome. However, after a 6-h stimulation of LPS-primed BMMΦ with chitin and chitosan hexamers, IL-1β concentrations in the supernatants were below the limits of detection. To examine whether the lack of stimulation by the chitosan hexamers was a general property of soluble chitosan, we solubilized chitosan by dissolving it in dilute acetic acid. Although the soluble chitosan induced IL-1β release, the levels were less than 20% of that seen when insoluble particulate chitosan served as the stimulus (Fig. 4F). The inverse association of size of the chitosan particles with inflammasome activity suggests that phagocytosis is necessary for inflammasome activation. To test this supposition further, we examined the effect of cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization and phagocytosis, on stimulated release of IL-1β (Fig. 5). For the particulates, alum and chitosan, pretreatment of macrophages with cytochalasin D significantly reduced the amount of IL-1β produced. The small amount of IL-1β stimulated by the chitin was also inhibited by cytochalasin D. However, IL-1β production in response to soluble nigericin was unaffected. Taken together, the data demonstrate that phagocytosis is required for IL-1β activation by chitosan. The immunological properties of chitin and chitosan have been the subject of much investigation. However, previously reported studies generally used partially purified preparations and/or did not compare the two glycans side by side. Here we utilized preparations that were derived from a common source and differed solely by their degree of acetylation to ascertain what impact acetylation had on inflammasome activation. We found that although chitosan potently activates the inflammasome, chitin is only a very weak stimulator. The seemingly contradictory literature on the immunostimulatory properties of chitin and chitosan are likely due to many factors, including differences in the sources of the material, procedures used for purification, readouts for inflammatory responses, and the size of the glycan particles. Most published studies on chitin and chitosan used preparations derived from crustacean sources (16Wagner C.J. Huber S. Wirth S. Voehringer D. Eur. J.

We have previously reported that the hyporesponsiveness of a human IEC line to LPS was primarily the result of a down-regulation of TLR4 gene transcription through epigenetic mechanisms. In the present study we show that DNA methylation in the 5' region of the TLR4 gene is significantly higher in IECs than in splenic cells in vivo. The methylation was shown to be dependent on the differentiation state of the IECs, as the differentiated IEC population that expressed higher levels of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) also displayed greater methylation and lower expression of the TLR4 gene than the undifferentiated population. The IAP(high), differentiated population also showed less abundant expression of CDX2, the transcription factor required for the development of the intestine, than the IAP(low), undifferentiated population. Overexpression of CDX2 in an IEC line decreased the methylation level of the TLR4 gene, increased transcriptional promoter activity of the gene, and increased responsiveness to the TLR4 ligand. Furthermore, the methylation level of the TLR4 gene was significantly lower in IECs of the large intestine of germ-free mice than in those of conventional mice, whereas the level in IECs of the small intestine was almost equal between these mice, indicating that commensal bacteria contribute to the maintenance of intestinal symbiosis by controlling epigenetic modification of the host gene in the large intestine."

Previously, we identified the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)-related polyubiquitin-binding protein, optineurin (OPTN), as a novel binding partner of TBK1. To determine whether the ubiquitin-binding function of OPTN is involved in regulating TBK1 and IFNβ production, we generated a mouse in which wild-type optineurin was replaced by the polyubiquitin binding-defective mutant, OPTND477N/D477N. In this study, we found that LPS or poly(I:C)-induced TBK1 activity was significantly reduced in bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) from OPTND477N/D477N mice. Consistent with this, the phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the production of IFNβ mRNA and secretion were reduced. Stimulation of BMDMs with LPS triggered the phosphorylation of OPTN, which was reversed by phosphatase treatment and prevented by pharmacological inhibition of both the canonical IκB kinases (IKKα/β) and the IKK-related kinases (TBK1/IKKϵ). In contrast, LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of OPTN(D477N) was markedly reduced in BMDMs from OPTND477N/D477N mice, and inhibition of the canonical IKKs alone prevented phosphorylation, providing further evidence that ubiquitin binding to OPTN contributes to LPS-induced TBK1 activation. TBK1 and IKKβ phosphorylated OPTN preferentially at Ser-177 and Ser-513, respectively, in vitro. In conclusion, our results suggest that OPTN binds to polyubiquitylated species formed in response to LPS and poly(I:C), enhancing the activation of TBK1 that is required for optimal phosphorylation of IRF3 and production of IFNβ.

A polyubiquitin-binding domain present in NEMO, originally termed ABIN homology domain 2 (AHD2) (15Heyninck K. Kreike M.M. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but later renamed the ubiquitin-binding domain in ABINs (A20-binding inhibitors of NF-κB) and NEMO (UBAN) (16Wagner S. Carpentier I. Rogov V. Kreike M. Ikeda F. Löhr F. Wu C.J. Ashwell J.D. Dötsch V. Dikic I. Beyaert R. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3739-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), is found in four other human proteins, termed ABIN1, ABIN2, ABIN3, and optineurin (OPTN). We recently generated a knock-in mouse in which wild-type ABIN1 was replaced by ABIN1(D485N), a mutation equivalent to the conversion of Asp-311 in NEMO to Asn, and which also abrogates binding to K63-pUb or linear-pUb chains (17Nanda S.K.

Interestingly, we found that ABIN1D485N/D485N knock-in mice developed all the hallmarks of lupus. Moreover, in response to a variety of TLR ligands, TAK1-dependent signaling events, such as the activation of the canonical IKK complex and MAPKs, were enhanced in both bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and macrophages from ABIN1D485N/D485N mice, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production was similarly elevated. From this study, we were able to demonstrate that autoimmunity in the ABIN1D485N/D485N mice was driven by the hyper-activation of the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway and, importantly, established that the interaction of ABIN1 with polyubiquitin chains limits the strength of TLR signaling and the production of cytokines (17Nanda S.K.

The protein most closely related to NEMO is OPTN, and for this reason, it has also been termed NEMO-related protein. OPTN, like NEMO, contains a zinc finger at its C terminus, which is reported to facilitate binding of K63-pUb chains to NEMO (18Laplantine E. Fontan E. Chiaravalli J. Lopez T. Lakisic G. Véron M.

Although important roles for NEMO and ABINs have been elucidated, the physiological roles of OPTN have yet to be defined. Previously, we identified the noncanonical IKK, TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1), a central kinase involved in production of type I IFNs (19Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E.

Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Type I IFNs, such as IFNβ, are induced during bacterial and viral infection and stimulate the transcription of a large set of genes important for the host defense via signaling through the type 1 IFNα/β receptor (24Pietras E.M. Saha S.K. Cheng G. J. Endotoxin Res. 2006; 12: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The recognition of viral and bacterial components, such as dsRNA and LPS, is mediated by host pattern recognition receptors, including TLR3, TLR4, and the cytosolic RNA and DNA receptors (25Creagh E.M.

When engaged, these receptors stimulate the phosphorylation of IRF3, which is catalyzed by TBK1, and the related IκB kinase family member IKKϵ. This induces the dimerization of IRF3 and its translocation to the nucleus where it stimulates IFNβ gene transcription (19Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T.

Studies utilizing TBK1-deficient BMDMs determined that TBK1 is specifically required for IFNβ production in response to activation of TLR3 and TLR4 (22Perry A.K. Chow E.K. Goodnough J.B. Yeh W.C. Cheng G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), whereas TBK1 is not required for type I IFN production in response to RNA virus infection in BMDMs and dendritic cells (22Perry A.K.

However, IFNβ production induced by viral infection was subsequently found to be unimpaired in BMDCs from TANK−/− mice (34Kawagoe T. Takeuchi O. Takabatake Y. Kato H. Isaka Y. Tsujimura T. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the critical TBK1-adaptor complex(es) responsible for activation of TBK1 and production of type I IFNs in innate immune cells remains to be defined. Here, we investigate the physiological role of OPTN using a knock-in mouse in which the wild-type protein has been replaced by OPTN(D477N), a polyubiquitin-binding defective mutant. We find that nearly all the OPTN in BMDMs is associated with TBK1. We further show that the activation of TBK1 and the phosphorylation of its substrate, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), are reduced in BMDMs from OPTND477N/D477N mice, leading to decreased production of IFNβ mRNA and IFNβ secretion. Thus, by utilizing a genetic approach, our findings describe an in vivo role for OPTN and demonstrate the importance of polyubiquitin-binding to OPTN for optimal activation of TBK1 and IFNβ production.

Fusion proteins in which glutathione transferase (GST) was linked covalently to the N termini of human interferon regulatory factor 3, OPTN, OPTN(D474N), NEMO, and NEMO(D311N), were expressed in E. coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose. Human TBK1 and IKKβ were expressed from baculovirus vectors in Sf21 cells and purified by the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation Unit, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, UK. The optn gene consists of 14 exons. OPTN knock-in mice were generated by TaconicArtemis (Hudson, NY) using standard protocols. Briefly, a targeting vector was constructed to introduce a point mutation corresponding to an Asp-477 to Asn mutation in exon 12 of the optn gene. This vector was used to target an ES cell line derived from C57/B16N mice, and correct targeting was confirmed by Southern analysis. Positive clones were used to generate chimeric mice. These mice were crossed to FLPe transgenic mice (Taconic Artemis), which were also on a C57/B16 background. Crossing to the FLPe strain resulted in deletion of the FLP recognition target site-flanked selectable marker (neo). Germ line transmission was confirmed by PCR of ear biopsies using the primer sets listed in supplemental Table 1, and the mice crossed away from the FLPe transgene in subsequent matings. The OPTN+/+ and OPTND477N/D477N mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. All mice were maintained in accordance with United Kingdom and European Union regulations. All animal work was carried out under a project license granted by the United Kingdom Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Before being submitted to the Home Office, the application for the project license (60/3923), which described and justified the protocols to be used, was first reviewed and approved by the University of Dundee Ethical Review Committee. The University of Dundee is a designated establishment for breeding and for scientific procedures under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Antibodies against mouse OPTN (sheep number S308C, second bleed) or human OPTN (sheep number S009C, third bleed), human TBK1 (sheep S041C, second bleed), and the C-terminal peptide of mouse IKKϵ (NRLIERLHRVPSAPDV) (sheep S277C, second bleed), which were used to immunoprecipitate mouse OPTN, TBK1, and IKKϵ, respectively, were generated by the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, the Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation Unit, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK. Anti-OPTN antibody (for immunoblotting) and anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Antibodies that recognize TBK1 phosphorylated at Ser-172, IRF3 phosphorylated at Ser-396, IKKα/β phosphorylated at Ser-180/Ser-181, p105/NF-κB1 phosphorylated at Ser-933, STAT1 at Tyr701 and IκBα were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies that recognize JNK phosphorylated at Thr-183 and Tyr-185 and all forms of IRF3 were from Invitrogen, and an antibody that recognizes K63-pUb chains was from Millipore (clone number HWA4C4), and an antibody that recognizes ubiquitin was from Dako (Dako Glostrup, Denmark). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin was from Sigma. Antibodies recognizing all forms of IKKβ were from BD Biosciences, and rabbit-, mouse-, and sheep-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Pierce. To study the binding of polyubiquitin, GST-OPTN and GST-NEMO (8 μg), as well as the GST-OPTN(D474N) and GST-NEMO(D311N) mutants, were immobilized individually on glutathione-Sepharose (10 μl packed volume) and incubated for 1 h at 21 °C with 2 μg of Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked (Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA) or linear ubiquitin oligomers (Enzo Life Sciences, Plymouth Meeting, PA) in 0.3 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2 (Buffer A) plus 150 mm NaCl. The beads were washed five times with Buffer A plus 250 mm NaCl and once with Buffer A without Triton X-100, and the polyubiquitin chains associated with GST-OPTN and GST-NEMO were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin. BMDMs were obtained by differentiation of marrow from the femur and tibia of mice as described previously (37Ananieva O. Darragh J. Johansen C. Carr J.M. McIlrath J. Park J.M. Wingate A. Monk C.E. Toth R. Santos S.G. Iversen L. Arthur J.S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). One hour prior to stimulation with TLR agonists, aliquots of pharmacological inhibitors dissolved as 10 mm solutions in DMSO, or an equivalent volume of DMSO for control incubations, were added to the culture media. The BMDMs were then stimulated with the TLR ligands indicated in the figure legends. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated by trypsinization of embryonic day 12.5 fetus from either OPTN+/+ or OPTND477N/D477N pregnant mice. MEFs were used between passages 3 and 6 for all experiments. Cells were lysed and centrifuged, and the supernatant (cell extract) was removed. Cell extract (20–35 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (35Clark K. Peggie M. Plater L. Sorcek R.J. Young E.R. Madwed J.B. Hough J. McIver E.G. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2011; 434: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate OPTN, 50 μg of cell extract protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 8 μg of the sheep anti-mouse OPTN antibody. After end-over-end rotation for an additional 60 min at 4 °C with protein-G-Sepharose (15 μl), the Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with cell lysis buffer plus 0.15 m NaCl, denatured in SDS, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Endogenous TBK1 was immunoprecipitated from 50 μg of cell extract protein using 1 μg of antibody (TBK1-S041C; IKKϵ-S277C). The TBK1 immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm DTT. The washed beads were resuspended in 20 μl of the same buffer containing 2 μm GST-IRF3 and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (6 μCi/μl). The protein kinase reactions were carried out for 20 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 5% SDS. The samples were heated at 100 °C, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF nylon membrane, and the membrane autoradiographed to detect phosphorylated GST-IRF3. The levels of TBK1 present in the immunoprecipitation and the GST-IRF3 present in the reactions were detected by immunoblotting. Total RNA was extracted from BMDMs using the RNeasy micro kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). RNA was reverse-transcribed using random and oligo(dT) primers, qScript reverse transcriptase, and the accompanying reagents (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's directions. PCR mixes were assembled using the PerfeCT SYBR Green Fast mix (Quanta Biosciences). Reactions were performed with the SYBR Green (plus melting curve analysis) program on either the Bio-Rad iCycler or C1000 thermal cycler quantitative PCR system (Bio-Rad). All reactions were performed in duplicate. The primer sequences were as follows: IFNβ-FOR, 5′-GGAAAAGCAAGAGGAAAGATTGAC-3′, and IFNβ-REV, 5′-CCACCATCCAGGCGTAGC-3′; IL-12p40-FOR, 5′-TCATCAGGGACATCATCAAACC-3′, and IL-12p40-REV, 5′-TGAGGGAGAAGTAGGAATGGG-3′. The concentrations of IFNβ and IL-12p40 released into the cell culture media were determined by ELISA using the Verikine mouse IFNβ kit (PBL Interferon Source, Piscataway, NJ) or Quantikine mouse IL-12/IL-23p40 non-allele-specific kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), respectively. The mutation of Asp-311 of NEMO to Asn not only prevents it from binding to K63-pUb chains (9Ea C.K. Deng L. Xia Z.P. Pineda G. Chen Z.J. Mol.

Before making a knock-in mouse expressing a polyubiquitin-binding defective mutant of OPTN, we therefore investigated whether the equivalent mutation in human OPTN, Asp-474 to Asn, also prevented binding of human OPTN to polyubiquitin. When presented with a mixture of small ubiquitin oligomers linked via Lys-63, OPTN (Fig. 1B), like NEMO (Fig. 1A), preferentially captured the largest polyubiquitin chains present, even though they were trace components in the mixture of ubiquitin oligomers used in these experiments. OPTN, like NEMO, did not bind detectably to Lys-48-linked ubiquitin oligomers under the conditions tested (Fig. 1, A and B). OPTN, like NEMO, also captured a linear ubiquitin oligomer consisting of nine ubiquitins but did not capture linear di-ubiquitin in our assay (Fig. 1, C and D). An alignment of the amino acid sequences in human and mouse optineurin surrounding the critical Asp residue is compared with the corresponding sequences in NEMO in Fig. 1E. We therefore generated a knock-in mouse in which wild-type OPTN was replaced by the OPTN(D477N) mutant, equivalent to the OPTN(D474N) mutant of human OPTN (Fig. 2, A and B). The OPTND477N/D477N mice developed normally, were born at normal Mendelian frequencies, and were of normal size and weight. Interestingly, we observed that the OPTN(D477N) mutant in OPTND477N/D477N mice was expressed at a higher level than wild-type OPTN in OPTN+/+ mice in a number of tissues (Fig. 2C). A smaller increase in the expression of OPTN was also observed in BMDMs (e.g. Fig. 3A, bottom panel).FIGURE 2Generation of OPTND477N/D477N knock-in mice. A, strategy for generating the D477N knock-in mutation in the mouse optn gene. A vector was used to introduce a point mutation producing the D477N mutation into exon 12 of the OPTN locus and loxP sites (open triangles) either side of exon 12. The vector also contained a neomycin resistance cassette (neo) flanked by FLP recognition target sites (closed diamonds) for positive selection and a thymidine kinase gene (TK) for negative selection. The vector was used to target ES cells, which were screened by Southern blots using a probe 5′ to the targeting vector. The vector introduced an additional EcoRV site (black arrow, E) in the neo gene and an HpaI site (gray arrow, H) 3′ to the second loxP site. B, using the 5′ probe, EcoRV and HpaI digests gave bands of 30 or 22.6 kb, respectively, for a wild-type allele or 8.2 and 11.1 kb for a targeted locus. ES cells were used to generate knock-in mice from which the neo gene was removed by crossing to FLPe transgenic mice.

https://openalex.org/W1984776107,"Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and its incidence has doubled in the last two decades. It represents only 4% of skin cancer cases per year, but causes as many as 74% of skin cancer deaths. Early detection of malignant melanoma is associated with survival rates of up to 90%, but later detection (stage III to stage IV) is associated with survival rates of only 10%. Dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression has been linked to tumor development and progression by functioning either as a tumor suppressor, an oncogene or a metastasis regulator in multiple cancer types. To understand the role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma and identify biomarkers of metastasis, miRNA expression profiles in skin punches from 33 metastatic melanoma patients and 14 normal healthy donors were compared. We identified a cluster of 14 miRNAs on the X chromosome, termed the miR-506-514 cluster, which was consistently overexpressed in nearly all melanomas tested (30–60 fold, P<0.001), regardless of mutations in N-ras or B-raf. Inhibition of the expression of this cluster as a whole, or one of its sub-clusters (Sub-cluster A) consisting of six mature miRNAs, led to significant inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased invasiveness and decreased colony formation in soft agar across multiple melanoma cell lines. Sub-cluster A of the miR-506-514 cluster was critical for maintaining the cancer phenotype, but the overexpression of the full cluster was necessary for melanocyte transformation. Our results provide new insights into the functional role of this miRNA cluster in melanoma, and suggest new approaches to treat or diagnose this disease."

A report suggested staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) was increasing over 2000-2003. The last population-based assessment of TSS was 1986.Population-based active surveillance for TSS meeting the CDC definition using ICD-9 codes was conducted in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area (population 2,642,056) from 2000-2006. Medical records of potential cases were reviewed for case criteria, antimicrobial susceptibility, risk factors, and outcome. Superantigen PCR testing and PFGE were performed on available isolates from probable and confirmed cases.Of 7,491 hospitalizations that received one of the ICD-9 study codes, 61 TSS cases (33 menstrual, 28 non-menstrual) were identified. The average annual incidence per 100,000 of all, menstrual, and non-menstrual TSS was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.32-0.77), 0.69 (0.39-1.16), and 0.32 (0.12-0.67), respectively. Women 13-24 years had the highest incidence at 1.41 (0.63-2.61). No increase in incidence was observed from 2000-2006. MRSA was isolated in 1 menstrual and 3 non-menstrual cases (7% of TSS cases); 1 isolate was USA400. The superantigen gene tst-1 was identified in 20 (80%) of isolates and was more common in menstrual compared to non-menstrual isolates (89% vs. 50%, p = 0.07). Superantigen genes sea, seb and sec were found more frequently among non-menstrual compared to menstrual isolates [100% vs 25% (p = 0.4), 60% vs 0% (p<0.01), and 25% vs 13% (p = 0.5), respectively].TSS incidence remained stable across our surveillance period of 2000-2006 and compared to past population-based estimates in the 1980s. MRSA accounted for a small percentage of TSS cases. tst-1 continues to be the superantigen associated with the majority of menstrual cases. The CDC case definition identifies the most severe cases and has been consistently used but likely results in a substantial underestimation of the total TSS disease burden."
https://openalex.org/W1969160416,"Background The decline of coral reefs globally underscores the need for a spatial assessment of their exposure to multiple environmental stressors to estimate vulnerability and evaluate potential counter-measures. Methodology/Principal Findings This study combined global spatial gradients of coral exposure to radiation stress factors (temperature, UV light and doldrums), stress-reinforcing factors (sedimentation and eutrophication), and stress-reducing factors (temperature variability and tidal amplitude) to produce a global map of coral exposure and identify areas where exposure depends on factors that can be locally managed. A systems analytical approach was used to define interactions between radiation stress variables, stress reinforcing variables and stress reducing variables. Fuzzy logic and spatial ordinations were employed to quantify coral exposure to these stressors. Globally, corals are exposed to radiation and reinforcing stress, albeit with high spatial variability within regions. Based on ordination of exposure grades, regions group into two clusters. The first cluster was composed of severely exposed regions with high radiation and low reducing stress scores (South East Asia, Micronesia, Eastern Pacific and the central Indian Ocean) or alternatively high reinforcing stress scores (the Middle East and the Western Australia). The second cluster was composed of moderately to highly exposed regions with moderate to high scores in both radiation and reducing factors (Caribbean, Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Central Pacific, Polynesia and the western Indian Ocean) where the GBR was strongly associated with reinforcing stress. Conclusions/Significance Despite radiation stress being the most dominant stressor, the exposure of coral reefs could be reduced by locally managing chronic human impacts that act to reinforce radiation stress. Future research and management efforts should focus on incorporating the factors that mitigate the effect of coral stressors until long-term carbon reductions are achieved through global negotiations."
https://openalex.org/W2010580202,"Unique sensitivity of tumor cells to the inhibition of glycolysis is a good target for anticancer therapy. Here, we demonstrate that the pharmacologically activated tumor suppressor p53 mediates the inhibition of glycolytic enzymes in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We showed that p53 binds to the promoters of metabolic genes and represses their expression, including glucose transporters SLC2A12 (GLUT12) and SLC2A1 (GLUT1). Furthermore, p53-mediated repression of transcription factors c-Myc and HIF1α, key drivers of ATP-generating pathways in tumors, contributed to ATP production block. Inhibition of c-Myc by p53 mediated the ablation of several glycolytic genes in normoxia, whereas in hypoxia down-regulation of HIF1α contributed to this effect. We identified Sp1 as a transcription cofactor cooperating with p53 in the ablation of metabolic genes. Using different approaches, we demonstrated that glycolysis block contributes to the robust induction of apoptosis by p53 in cancer cells. Taken together, our data suggest that tumor-specific reinstatement of p53 function targets the “Achilles heel” of cancer cells (i.e. their dependence on glycolysis), which could contribute to the tumor-selective killing of cancer cells by pharmacologically activated p53.

https://openalex.org/W2007080030,"The transition from quiescence to proliferation is a key regulatory step that can be induced by serum stimulation in cultured fibroblasts. The transcription factor Myc is directly induced by serum mitogens and drives a secondary gene expression program that remains largely unknown. Using mRNA profiling, we identify close to 300 Myc-dependent serum response (MDSR) genes, which are induced by serum in a Myc-dependent manner in mouse fibroblasts. Mapping of genomic Myc-binding sites by ChIP-seq technology revealed that most MDSR genes were directly targeted by Myc, but represented a minor fraction (5.5%) of all Myc-bound promoters (which were 22.4% of all promoters). Other target loci were either induced by serum in a Myc-independent manner, were not significantly regulated or were negatively regulated. MDSR gene products were involved in a variety of processes, including nucleotide biosynthesis, ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication and RNA control. Of the 29 MDSR genes targeted by RNA interference, three showed a requirement for cell-cycle entry upon serum stimulation and 11 for long-term proliferation and/or survival. Hence, proper coordination of key regulatory and biosynthetic pathways following mitogenic stimulation relies upon the concerted regulation of multiple Myc-dependent genes."
https://openalex.org/W2026420916,"Ocean acidification, due to anthropogenic CO2 absorption by the ocean, may have profound impacts on marine biota. Calcareous organisms are expected to be particularly sensitive due to the decreasing availability of carbonate ions driven by decreasing pH levels. Recently, some studies focused on the early life stages of mollusks that are supposedly more sensitive to environmental disturbances than adult stages. Although these studies have shown decreased growth rates and increased proportions of abnormal development under low pH conditions, they did not allow attribution to pH induced changes in physiology or changes due to a decrease in aragonite saturation state. This study aims to assess the impact of several carbonate-system perturbations on the growth of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae during the first 3 days of development (until shelled D-veliger larvae). Seawater with five different chemistries was obtained by separately manipulating pH, total alkalinity and aragonite saturation state (calcium addition). Results showed that the developmental success and growth rates were not directly affected by changes in pH or aragonite saturation state but were highly correlated with the availability of carbonate ions. In contrast to previous studies, both developmental success into viable D-shaped larvae and growth rates were not significantly altered as long as carbonate ion concentrations were above aragonite saturation levels, but they strongly decreased below saturation levels. These results suggest that the mechanisms used by these organisms to regulate calcification rates are not efficient enough to compensate for the low availability of carbonate ions under corrosive conditions."

Stimulation of chemoattractant receptors also induces the biogenesis of a uropod at the posterior pole of the cell, via a signaling cascade involving the Rho family GTPase RhoA (20Xu J. Wang F.

The uropod is a large protrusion (>1 μm) that mediates cell retraction during chemotaxis and plays key roles in signal transduction and endocytosis (22Sánchez-Madrid F. Serrador J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Numerous proteins are selectively targeted to uropods, and in mammalian cells these include PM proteins (e.g. CD43, CD44, and others) and cytosolic scaffolding proteins (e.g. ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM proteins)) that bind to filamentous actin and generate highly oligomeric, PM-anchored protein complexes (22Sánchez-Madrid F. Serrador J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Fehon R.G. McClatchey A.I. Bretscher A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the molecular composition and function of the uropod, there is as yet no general paradigm for how cells establish a posterior pole, selectively target proteins to this pole, or convert it into a functional uropod. Here we report on the relationship between cell polarity and the protein-sorting pathway that targets proteins to secreted vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles, or EMVs). EMVs are small vesicles (∼50 to 250 nm diameter) that bud from animal cells and transmit signals, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids to neighboring cells (24Schorey J.S. Bhatnagar S.

This differential sorting of proteins and lipids to distinct domains of the plasma membrane is reminiscent of cell polarity, and we show here that the EMV protein-sorting pathway plays several important roles in the biogenesis of the posterior pole. CCRF-CEM and Hsb-2 T cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI medium (Invitrogen/BRL) containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. HL60 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 20% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. For differentiation of HL60 cells, 190 μl of DMSO was added to 106 cells in 15 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 20% FBS for a period of 5–7 days. Jurkat T cells were a gift of Dr. James Hildreth (Meharry Medical College) and were grown in serum-free medium (AIM-V, Invitrogen/BRL). Transfections of CCRF-CEM, Hsb-2, Jurkat T cells, and HL60 cells were by nucleofection as recommended by the manufacturer (Amaxa Technologies). D. discoideum cells (AX2 strain) were cultured in HL5 medium at 22 °C. The D. discoideum cell lines expressing EIAV Gag-GFP or HIV Gag-GFP were generated by electroporation of AX2 cells with the plasmids pCV5/EIAV Gag-GFP or pCV5/HIV Gag-GFP, followed by selection on G418-containing medium for 7–10 days (39Gaudet P. Pilcher K.E. Fey P. Chisholm R.L. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). G418-resistant colonies were collected, and expressing clones were identified by fluorescence microscopy. D. discoideum cells stably expressing EIAV Gag-GFP or HIV Gag-GFP were grown in HL5 medium containing 20 μg/ml G418. N-Rh-PE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)) and N-F-PE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(carboxyfluorescein)) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Antibodies specific for CD43, pERM proteins, CD44, and ICAM-2 were obtained from commercial sources. The antibody to myosin II was a generous gift from J. Yang (Johns Hopkins University). The fMLP peptides, DAPI, and Y-27632 were from Sigma. The HIV Gag-GFP and HIV Gag expression vectors were described previously (35Booth A.M. Fang Y. Fallon J.K. Yang J.M. Hildreth J.E. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), as were the plasmids designed for mammalian cell expression of EIAV Gag-GFP, MLV Gag-GFP, and HTLV-1 Gag-GFP TyA-GFP, AcylTyA-GFP, AcylTyA, HIV Gag(p49)-GFP, HIV Gag(p41)-GFP, HIV Gag(p41)-LZ-GFP, HIV Gag(p41)-p6-GFP, HIV Gag(p39*)-GFP, HIV Gag(p39*)-LZ-GFP, HIV Gag(p39*)-LZ-DsREDm, HIV Gag(p39*)-LZ-DsRED, HIV Gag-DsRED (30Fang Y. Wu N. Gan X. Yan W. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e158Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and for HIV Gag(G2A)-GFP, MusD-GFP, AcylMusD-GFP, AKT-TyA-GFP, AKT-GFP, CD43-GFP, and CD43-TyA-GFP (35Booth A.M. Fang Y. Fallon J.K. Yang J.M. Hildreth J.E. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To make the Lys-282 → Asn, Arg-283 → Gly, and Arg-284 → Gly mutations (40Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) in the CD43-GFP ORF, we amplified the CD43 ORF with sets of nested primers designed to generate the desired mutations, and then cloned the mutant CD43 ORF between the Asp-718 and BamHI sites of pcDNA3-GFP. The same fragment was amplified using primers designed to append HindIII and Asp-718 sites on the 5′ and 3′ ends of the ORF, respectively, and cloned between the HindIII and Asp-718 sites of pcDNA3-TyA-GFP (35Booth A.M. Fang Y. Fallon J.K. Yang J.M. Hildreth J.E. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The plasmid designed to express centrin-DsREDm was synthesized by amplifying the ORF of human centrin (41Errabolu R. Sanders M.A. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides that appended an Asp-718 site immediately upstream of the start codon and a BamHI site in place of its stop codon, cleaving the product with Asp-718 and BamHI, and cloning the resulting fragment between the Asp-718 and BamHI sites of pcDNA3-DsREDm. The CFP-Golgi expression vector was from Clontech. To express EIAV Gag-GFP and HIV Gag-GFP in D. discoideum, we amplified the ORF with a ribosome binding site (AAATAAAA) upstream of the start codon, and Asp-718 and BamHI sites on the 5′ and 3′ ends of the fragment, respectively. These were then inserted between the Asp-718 and BamHI sites of pcDNA3-GFP to generate intermediate plasmids. The Gag-GFP ORFs were then excised with Asp-718 and XhoI and cloned between the Asp-718 and XhoI sites of a modified form of pCV5 with unique Asp-718 and XhoI sites downstream of the promoter. Lipid labeling was carried out by chilling cells to 4 °C, incubating them with N-Rh-PE or N-F-PE (1 μm final concentration) at 4 °C, washing the cells three times with PBS, then incubating the cells in growth medium for 14–24 h at 37 °C. DAPI labeling was as described previously (35Booth A.M. Fang Y. Fallon J.K. Yang J.M. Hildreth J.E. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Antibody labeling of cell surface proteins CD43, CD44, CD63, and ICAM2 was performed by fixing cells in 4% p-formaldehyde/PBS, incubating them with unlabeled primary antibodies, washing extensively in PBS, incubating cells with fluorescently labeled anti-mouse IgG antibodies, then washing again in PBS. Antibody labeling of pERM was carried out by fixing cells in 4% p-formaldehyde/PBS, permeabilizing the cells with 1% Triton X-100/PBS, then incubating the cells with unlabeled primary antibodies/PBS, washing the cells in PBS, incubating the cells with fluorescently labeled polyclonal secondary antibodies, washing again with PBS, then examining the cells by fluorescence and phase-contrast microscopy. For lipid-labeled cells, the samples were fixed in 4% p-formaldehyde/PBS, washed in PBS, and then examined by fluorescence and phase-contrast microscopy. Microscopy was performed at 20–25 °C using a fluorescence microscope (BH-2, Olympus) equipped with a 60× numerical aperture 1.4 lens. Images were captured with a charge-coupled device camera (Sensicam QE, Cooke) linked to a Mac G4 computer using IPlab software (Scanalytics). In all experiments we examined >20 expressing cells, and the EMV cargoes were sorted to the uropod in >90% of the cells. Migrating cells were examined using an inverted Zeiss fluorescence microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with a 63× numerical aperture 1.4 lens and dedicated imaging software (LSM image browser, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Chemotaxis was initiated by exposure of differentiated HL60 cells to 10 μm fMLP peptide, or by exposure of differentiated D. discoideum cells to 1 μm cAMP, each introduced through a micropipette. Immunogold surface labeling of Jurkat T cells was performed essentially as described (42McCaffery J.M. Farquhar M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 259-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated at 4 °C with anti-CD43 monoclonal antibody/PBS for 1 h, washed with PBS at 4 °C, incubated at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies in PBS, then incubated in growth medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 2% p-formaldehyde in 100 mm PO4, pH 7.4, washed, blocked in 10% fetal calf serum in 100 mm PO4, pH 7.4, for 20 min, and incubated overnight with donkey anti-rabbit IgG 18-nm gold conjugate, washed, and fixed a second time for 1 h in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2.5% sucrose (w/v), and 100 mm cacodylate, pH 7.4. The cells were spun into a tight pellet, fixed in Palade's osmium for 1 h, en bloc stained overnight in Kellenberger's uranyl acetate, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in Epon. 80 nm Ultrathin sections were cut on an ultramicrotome (model UCT, Leica) collected onto 400-mesh high transmission nickel grids, post-stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed on a transmission electron microscope (EM 410, Philips). Transmission electron microscopy was performed using the same procedure except that antibody incubations were omitted. For antibody-induced, higher order oligomerization of CD43, cells were brought to 4 °C and incubated with FITC-conjugated primary monoclonal antibodies specific for CD43, in PBS, for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed in PBS at 4 °C, then either incubated in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h or in PBS containing polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies for 1 h, washed, all at 4 °C, and then incubated in growth medium for 1 h at 37 °C to allow CD43 trafficking to occur. EMV cargoes are targeted to discrete domains of the plasma membrane in morphologically non-polarized T cells (30Fang Y. Wu N. Gan X. Yan W. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e158Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 35Booth A.M. Fang Y. Fallon J.K. Yang J.M. Hildreth J.E. Gould S.J. J.

Chem. 2011; 286: 14383-14395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, there is a distinct heterogeneity in regard to the distribution of EMV budding sites in these cells, with most cells (∼70%) possessing several EMV budding sites dispersed over the cell surface, and a smaller percentage (∼25%) clustering their EMV budding sites at a single pole (35Booth A.M. Fang Y. Fallon J.K. Yang J.M. Hildreth J.E. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The occasionally polarized distribution of EMV cargoes in morphologically non-polarized leukocytes raised the possibility that the EMV protein-sorting pathway might play a role in cell polarity. We explored this idea by following the distribution of EMV test proteins in morphologically polarized T cells, primarily the Hsb-2 and CEM T-cell lines. We previously developed matched pairs of EMV test proteins, such as (i) the yeast TyA protein, a highly oligomeric, cytoplasmic protein, and (ii) AcylTyA, a PM-anchored derivative that is secreted from the cells in EMVs (30Fang Y. Wu N. Gan X. Yan W. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e158Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 38Shen B. Wu N. Yang J.M. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 14383-14395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged forms of these two proteins were expressed in the polarized T-cell lines Hsb-2 and CEM cells, and localized relative to the uropod marker proteins CD43 and CD44 (22Sánchez-Madrid F. Serrador J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 43Sánchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). TyA-GFP accumulated in the cytoplasm of Hsb-2 T cells (Fig. 1, A–D). In contrast, AcylTyA-GFP was selectively targeted to their uropod (Fig. 1, A–H), indicating that the EMV protein-sorting pathway might play a role in protein trafficking to the posterior pole. Similar results were observed in CEM T cells (supplemental Fig. S1, A–H). To determine whether the posterior pole trafficking of AcylTyA-GFP was due to its specific type of membrane anchor, or whether other PM anchors would target TyA-GFP to uropods, we followed the sorting of AKT-TyA-GFP, which is secreted from the cell in EMVs and binds the PM via a PIP3-binding domain (from the protein kinase AKT) (38Shen B. Wu N. Yang J.M. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 14383-14395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). AKT-TyA-GFP was highly enriched at the uropod of both Hsb-2 cells (Fig. 1, I–L) and CEM T cells (supplemental Fig. S1, I–L), providing additional evidence that EMV cargoes are targeted to the posterior pole. These results also show that proteins can be targeted to the uropod by very different types of PM anchors. The enrichment of AKT-TyA-GFP at the uropod is unlikely to reflect the relative distribution of PIP3 in the PM, because PIP3 is typically enriched at the anterior pole (3Rericha E.C. Parent C.A. Sci. Signal. 2008; 1: pe26Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Parent C.A. Blacklock B.J. Froehlich W.M. Murphy D.B. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), the PIP3 phosphatase phosphatase and tensin homolog is highly enriched at the uropod (44Wu Y. Hannigan M.O. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. Wu D. Huang C.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and an AKT-GFP fusion protein is not enriched at the uropod of Hsb-2 cells (Fig. 1, M–P). Another pair of EMV test proteins are (i) MusD-GFP, which accumulates in intracytoplasmic protein particles, and (ii) AcylMusD-GFP, which is sorted to sites of EMV budding and secreted from the cell in vesicles (38Shen B. Wu N. Yang J.M. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 14383-14395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Following their expression in Hsb-2 T cells, we observed that MusD-GFP accumulated in intracellular particles, whereas AcylMusD-GFP was localized to their uropod (Fig. 1, Q–X). Similar results were observed in CEM T cells (supplemental Fig. S1, M–T), and together, these results provide additional evidence that highly oligomeric, cytoplasmic proteins can be targeted to the uropod by a PM anchor. We also followed the subcellular distribution of classic exosomal markers. Many cells selectively target N-modified forms of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to sites of EMV budding and secrete them from the cell in EMVs (35Booth A.M. Fang Y. Fallon J.K. Yang J.M. Hildreth J.E. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 45Willem J. ter Beest M. Scherphof G. Hoekstra D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 173-184PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore pulse-labeled CEM T cells with the EMV lipid marker N-Rh-PE (a rhodamine-labeled form of PE), incubated them overnight, and stained them with antibodies to uropod marker proteins. CEM T cells selectively targeted N-Rh-PE to uropods where it co-localized with both CD44 (Fig. 2, A–D) and ICAM-2 (Fig. 2, E–H). N-Rh-PE-labeled CEM cells were also stained for the exosomal marker protein CD63 (26Simons M. Raposo G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar), and it too was highly enriched at uropods (Fig. 2, I–L). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the EMV protein-sorting pathway targets proteins to the uropod of polarized T cells. The polarized sorting of CD43 is modeled as a simple consequence of CD43 binding to ERM proteins (22Sánchez-Madrid F. Serrador J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Fehon R.G. McClatchey A.I. Bretscher A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that CD43-GFP was localized to the uropod of Hsb-2 cells (Fig. 3, A–D), whereas the CD43(NGG)-GFP protein, which carries a triple mutation that disrupts ERM-CD43 binding (Lys-282 → Asn, Arg-283 → Gly, and Arg-284 → Gly (40Yonemura S.

Alonso-Lebrero J.L. del Pozo M.A. Calvo J. Furthmayr H. Schwartz-Albiez R. Lozano F. González-Amaro R. Sánchez-Mateos P. Sánchez-Madrid F. Blood. 1998; 91: 4632-4644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), abbreviated here as NGG), was not enriched at the uropod and instead was distributed over the entire PM (Fig. 3, E–H). To test whether CD43(NGG)-GFP could be redirected back to the uropod by the EMV pathway, we fused it to the highly oligomeric cytoplasmic protein TyA, which targets CD43-GFP into the EMV protein-sorting pathway (38Shen B. Wu N. Yang J.M. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 14383-14395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The resulting protein, CD43(NGG)-TyA-GFP, was selectively targeted to uropods (Fig. 3, I–L). These results demonstrate that the polarized trafficking of CD43 does not require interaction with ERM proteins per se, so long as CD43 is targeted into the EMV protein-sorting pathway. To determine whether the EMV protein-sorting pathway might play an early role in the biogenesis of the posterior pole, we followed the sorting of both EMV cargoes and classic uropod markers following the drug-induced elimination of uropods. Uropod biogenesis requires Rho kinase activity, and addition of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 to polarized leukocytes causes them to lose their uropod and redistribute uropod markers across the PM (47Fonseca A.V. Freund D. Bornhäuser M. Corbeil D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 31661-31671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rho kinase activity was also required for the polarized distribution of EMV marker proteins, we treated Hsb-2 cells expressing AcylTyA-GFP with 20 μm Y-27632 for 30 min, fixed them, stained them using antibodies specific for CD43, and examined them by epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4, A–H). Inhibition of Rho kinase caused the loss of morphological polarity and the redistribution of CD43 over the entire plasma membrane. However, it did not eliminate the polarized distribution of AcylTyA-GFP, demonstrating that Rho kinase is required for ur"
https://openalex.org/W2148063085,"During tumor initiation, oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is proposed to limit the progression of preneoplasms to invasive carcinoma unless circumvented by the acquisition of certain tumor suppressor mutations. Using a variety of biomarkers, OIS has been previously reported in a wide range of human and murine precursor lesions, including the pancreas, lung, colon and skin. Here, we have characterized a panel of potential OIS biomarkers in human and murine pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), and found that only senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SAβgal) activity is specifically enriched in these precursors, compared with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Indeed, many of the other proposed OIS biomarkers are detected in actively proliferating PanIN epithelium and in cells within the microenvironment. Surprisingly, acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM), a distinct preneoplasm that is potentially a precursor for PanIN, also exhibits SAβgal activity and contains a higher content of p21 and p53 than PanIN. Therefore, SAβgal activity is the only biomarker that accurately identifies a small and heterogeneous population of non-proliferating premalignant cells in the pancreas, and the concomitant expression of p53 and p21 in ADM supports the possibility that PanIN and ADM each exhibit discrete senescence blocks."
https://openalex.org/W2149199221,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a widespread neurodegenerative autoimmune disease with unknown etiology. It is increasingly evident that, together with pathogenic T cells, autoreactive B cells are among the major players in MS development. The analysis of myelin neuroantigen-specific antibody repertoires and their possible cross-reactivity against environmental antigens, including viral proteins, could shed light on the mechanism of MS induction and progression. A phage display library of single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) was constructed from blood lymphocytes of patienst with MS as a potential source of representative MS autoantibodies. Structural alignment of 13 clones selected toward myelin basic protein (MBP), one of the major myelin antigens, showed high homology within variable regions with cerebrospinal fluid MS-associated antibodies as well as with antibodies toward Epstein-Barr latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Three scFv clones showed pronounced specificity to MBP fragments 65–92 and 130–156, similar to the serum MS antibodies. One of these clones, designated E2, in both scFv and full-size human antibody constructs, was shown to react with both MBP and LMP1 proteins in vitro, suggesting natural cross-reactivity. Thus, antibodies induced against LMP1 during Epstein-Barr virus infection might act as inflammatory trigger by reacting with MBP, suggesting molecular mimicry in the mechanism of MS pathogenesis.—Gabibov, A.

https://openalex.org/W2002665560,"PIM1 kinase and MYC are commonly co-expressed in human prostate cancer and synergize to induce rapidly progressing prostate cancer in mouse models. Deficiency of the Pim kinase genes is well tolerated in vivo, suggesting that PIM1 inhibition might offer an attractive therapeutic modality for prostate cancer, particularly for MYC-expressing tumors. Here we examine the molecular consequences of Pim1 and MYC overexpression in the prostate as well as the effects of depleting Pim1 in prostate carcinoma cells with high levels of MYC. Overexpression of Pim1 in the mouse prostate induces several pro-tumorigenic genetic programs including cell cycle genes and Myc-regulated genes before the induction of any discernible pathology. Pim1 depletion by RNA interference in mouse and human prostate cancer cells decreased cellular proliferation, survival, Erk signaling and tumorigenicity even when MYC levels were not significantly altered. These results indicate that PIM1 may be necessary to maintain tumorigenicity, and further support efforts aimed at developing PIM1 inhibitors for prostate cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1992716524,"The tyrosine kinase c-Src is upregulated in various human cancers; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying c-Src-mediated tumor progression remain unclear. Here we show that downregulation of microRNA (miR)-542-3p is tightly associated with tumor progression via c-Src-related oncogenic pathways. In c-Src-transformed fibroblasts and human cancer cells that overexpress c-Src, miR-542-3p is substantially downregulated, and the ectopic expression of miR-542-3p suppresses tumor growth. We identified the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) as a conserved target of miR-542-3p. ILK upregulation promotes cell adhesion and invasion by activating the integrin–focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/c-Src pathway, and can also contribute to tumor growth via the AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3β pathways. MiR-542-3p expression is downregulated by the activation of c-Src-related signaling molecules, including epidermal growth factor receptor, K-Ras and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase. In human colon cancer tissues, downregulation of miR-542-3p is significantly correlated with the upregulation of c-Src and ILK. Our results suggest that the novel c-Src–miR-542-3p–ILK–FAK circuit plays a crucial role in controlling tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2107750620,"Ro52 (TRIM21) is an E3 ligase of the tripartite motif family that negatively regulates proinflammatory cytokine production by ubiquitinating transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factor family. Autoantibodies to Ro52 are present in patients with lupus and Sjögren's syndrome, but it is not known if these autoantibodies affect the function of Ro52. To address this question, the requirements for Ro52 E3 ligase activity were first analyzed in detail. Scanning a panel of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, we found that UBE2D1–4 and UBE2E1–2 supported the E3 ligase activity of Ro52 and that the E3 ligase activity of Ro52 was dependent on its RING domain. We also found that the N-terminal extensions in the class III E2 enzymes affected their interaction with Ro52. Although the N-terminal extension in UBE2E3 made this E2 enzyme unable to function together with Ro52, the N-terminal extensions in UBE2E1 and UBE2E2 allowed for a functional interaction with Ro52. Anti-Ro52-positive patient sera and affinity-purified anti-RING domain autoantibodies inhibited the E3 activity of Ro52 in ubiquitination assays. Using NMR, limited proteolysis, ELISA, and Ro52 mutants, we mapped the interactions between Ro52, UBE2E1, and anti-Ro52 autoantibodies. We found that anti-Ro52 autoantibodies inhibited the E3 ligase activity of Ro52 by sterically blocking the E2/E3 interaction between Ro52 and UBE2E1. Our data suggest that anti-Ro52 autoantibodies binding the RING domain of Ro52 may be actively involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatic autoimmune disease by inhibiting Ro52-mediated ubiquitination.

https://openalex.org/W1999572761,"Neuroblastoma tumors frequently show loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 11q with a shortest region of overlap in the 11q23 region. These deletions are thought to cause inactivation of tumor suppressor genes leading to haploinsufficiency. Alternatively, micro-deletions could lead to gene fusion products that are tumor driving. To identify such events we analyzed a series of neuroblastomas by comparative genomic hybridization and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and integrated these data with Affymetrix mRNA profiling data with the bioinformatic tool R2 ( http://r2.amc.nl ). We identified three neuroblastoma samples with small interstitial deletions at 11q23, upstream of the forkhead-box R1 transcription factor (FOXR1). Genes at the proximal side of the deletion were fused to FOXR1, resulting in fusion transcripts of MLL–FOXR1 and PAFAH1B2–FOXR1. FOXR1 expression has only been detected in early embryogenesis. Affymetrix microarray analysis showed high FOXR1 mRNA expression exclusively in the neuroblastomas with micro-deletions and rare cases of other tumor types, including osteosarcoma cell line HOS. RNAi silencing of FOXR1 strongly inhibited proliferation of HOS cells and triggered apoptosis. Expression profiling of these cells and reporter assays suggested that FOXR1 is a negative regulator of fork-head box factor-mediated transcription. The neural crest stem cell line JoMa1 proliferates in culture conditional to activity of a MYC-ER transgene. Over-expression of the wild-type FOXR1 could functionally replace MYC and drive proliferation of JoMa1. We conclude that FOXR1 is recurrently activated in neuroblastoma by intrachromosomal deletion/fusion events, resulting in overexpression of fusion transcripts. Forkhead-box transcription factors have not been previously implicated in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. Furthermore, this is the first identification of intrachromosomal fusion genes in neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W1985413346,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in diabetic patients due to high blood glucose levels and cause multiple deleterious effects. In this study, we provide evidence that the AGE increased cell death, one such deleterious effect. Methyl glyoxal-coupled human serum albumin (AGE-HSA) induced transcription factors such as NF-κB, NF-AT, and AP-1. AGE acts through its cell surface receptor, RAGE, and degranulates vesicular contents including interleukin-8 (IL-8). The number of RAGEs, as well as the amount of NF-κB activation, is low, but the cell death is higher in neuronal cells upon AGE treatment. Degranulated IL-8 acts through its receptors, IL-8Rs, and induces sequential events in cells: increase in intracellular Ca(2+), activation of calcineurin, dephosphorylation of cytoplasmic NF-AT, nuclear translocation of NF-AT, and expression of FasL. Expressed FasL increases activity of caspases and induces cell death. Although AGE increases the amount of reactive oxygen intermediate, accompanying cell death is not dependent upon reactive oxygen intermediate. AGE induces autophagy, which partially protects cells from cell death. A novel mechanism of AGE-mediated cell death in different cell types, especially in neuronal cells where it is an early event, is provided here. Thus, this study may be important in several age-related neuronal diseases where AGE-induced apoptosis is observed because of high amounts of AGE."

Two hybridoma-producing mouse RANKL Mabs (clones OYC1 and OYC2) were subcloned from hybridoma kindly provided by Dr. Okumura (Juntendo University School of Medicine) and manufactured by Oriental Yeast Co. (29Kamijo S. Nakajima A. Ikeda K. Aoki K. Ohya K. Akiba H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recombinant human OPG-Fc and mouse soluble RANKL (sRANKL) were purchased from R&D Systems. PTH(1–34) and calcein were purchased from Sigma. Other reagents were purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Japan). Five-week-old female C57BL/6N mice were purchased from Charles River Inc. and acclimated for 1 week under standard laboratory conditions at 24 ± 2 °C and 40–70% humidity. Mice were treated according to the institutional ethical guidelines for animal experimentation and safety. To establish the effect of the mRANKL Mabs on bone mass, the neutralizing antibody (OYC1) and non-neutralizing control antibody (OYC2) were administered intraperitoneally to 6-week-old female mice (n = 5) three times per week for 2 weeks. Calcein was injected twice subcutaneously for labeling on days 10 and 13. At 12 h after the last administration, femurs were extirpated and fixed with 70% ethanol. To determine the suboptimal dose of OYC1 for increasing the BMD, various doses (0.5, 1, 1.5, 5, and 15 mg/kg) of OYC1 or vehicle (PBS) were injected subcutaneously in 6-week-old female mice (n = 5) once on day 0. Blood samples and both femurs were obtained on day 14, and the femurs were fixed with 70% ethanol. To examine the time course of the effect of OYC1, 5 mg/kg OYC1 or PBS was administered subcutaneously to 6-week-old female mice (n = 5–6) on day 0. The mice were sacrificed on days 4, 7, 14, and 28, and sera and femurs were obtained on these days. To examine the early part of the time course in more detail, 5 mg/kg OYC1 or PBS was administered subcutaneously to 6-week-old female mice (n = 5–6) on day 0. The mice were sacrificed on days 1–4, and sera and femurs were obtained on these days. To examine the utility of the RANKL-neutralizing model, we tested whether PTH could induce bone formation in OYC1-treated mice. OYC1 (5 mg/kg) or PBS was injected once in 6-week-old female mice (n = 5). After 4 days, PTH (160 μg/kg) or PBS was injected subcutaneously daily for 2 weeks in these mice. The mice treated with PTH after transient neutralization of RANKL with OYC1 were sacrificed on day 18, and sera, femurs, and tibias were collected. BMDs were determined in fixed right femurs by single energy x-ray absorptiometry (SXA, DCS-600EX; Aloka, Japan). The femurs were divided into 20 equal regions from distal (region 1) to proximal (region 20), and the BMD of each region was measured by SXA. In some experiments, BMD was measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT, XCT Research SA+, Stratec Medizintechnic, Pforzheim, Germany) using a voxel size of 0.08 × 0.08 × 0.46 mm. Image analysis was carried out using integrated XCT 2000 software version 6.00f. Total BMD at 0.8 or 1.0 mm from the growth plate is shown due to the marked increase of BMD after injection of OYC1. Cortical bone was defined based on BMD >690 mg/cm3 at the femoral metaphysis. Cortical area (mm2), cortical thickness (mm), periosteal perimeter of the cortical bone (in mm), endosteal perimeter of the cortical bone (in mm), x axis strength-strain index (in mm3), y axis strength-strain index (in mm3), and polar strength-strain index (in mm3) were measured. Three-dimensional digital images of femurs were reconstructed by micro-CT analysis at 0.2–1.2 mm from the growth plate using a ScanXmate-A080 (Comscan Tecno). Analysis of micro-CT images was performed with TRI/3D-Bon (Ratoc System Engineering Co., Japan). Fixed and undecalcified femurs were embedded in glycol methacrylate or methyl methacrylate and 3–5-μm sections in the proximal region and distal femoral metaphysis of each femur were cut longitudinally and stained with toluidine blue O. Some samples were stained by the Villanueva method. Histomorphometry was performed with an image analysis system (Ostoplan II, Carl Zeiss, New York) linked to a light microscope. Histomorphometric measurements were made at ×400 magnification in the secondary spongiosa area. The bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV, %), trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th, μm) osteoclast surface/bone surface (Oc.S/BS, %), eroded surface/bone surface (ES/BS, %), osteoclast number/bone surface (N.Oc/BS, 1/mm), osteoblast surface/bone surface (Ob.S/BS, %), osteoblast number/bone surface (N.Ob/BS, 1/mm), the mineral apposition rate (MAR, μm/day), bone formation rate/bone surface (BFR/BS, mm3/mm2/year) were calculated and expressed according to standard formulas and nomenclature (30Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4899) Google Scholar). For TRAP staining, 3-μm sections in the proximal metaphysis of the undecalcified tibia were cut longitudinally and stained with TRAP. Serum levels of calcium and ALP were measured according to the manufacturers' instructions using a calcium C assay and a LabAssay ALP (Wako, Japan) (p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) assay), respectively. Serum mouse osteocalcin, TRAP-5b, and intact PTH were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to manufacturers' instructions (Biomedical Technologies, MA; Immunodiagnostic Systems, AZ; and Immutopics, CA; respectively). The serum level of OYC1 was measured by ELISA. Recombinant mRANKL was coated on an ELISA plate (Nunc) at 2.5 nm, and the serum antibody titer was detected by HRP-conjugated rat IgG2a (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Each value was determined by absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Results are expressed as means ± S.D. for all data. Significance of differences was determined by ANOVA with a Dunnett's test or Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. To characterize the anti-mRANKL Mabs, OYC1 and OYC2, a binding assay was performed by direct ELISA. Both antibodies recognized recombinant mouse sRANKL (mRANKL), including the extracellular domain from Arg-72 to Asp-316 (supplemental Fig. 1A). Neither OYC1 nor OYC2 bound to mouse TRAIL (data not shown). OYC1 neutralized mRANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. OYC1 (0.2 μg/ml) and human OPG-Fc (0.1 μg/ml) completely suppressed osteoclast formation induced by 5 nm mRANKL, but OYC2 did not do so (supplemental Fig. 1B). OYC1 did not bind to or inhibit human sRANKL (hRANKL, supplemental Fig. 1B, and data not shown). Morphological examination of cells cultured in the presence of mRANKL with or without OYC1 confirmed the complete inhibition of formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (supplemental Fig. 1C). These results indicate that OYC1 is a neutralizing Mab and OYC2 is a non-neutralizing Mab. To investigate the effect of the Mabs in vivo, 15 mg/kg OYC1 or OYC2 or vehicle (PBS) were administered intraperitoneally to mice three times per week for 2 weeks (Fig. 1A). OYC2 showed no effect on BMD in femurs of the treated mice, whereas OYC1 markedly increased the BMD, especially in the distal metaphysis, compared with OYC2 and vehicle. In contrast, OYC1 had little effect on BMD in the femoral diaphysis (Fig. 1A). Photomicrographs of toluidine blue O staining of femurs of the OYC1-treated mice also indicated a marked increase in bone mass in the distal femoral metaphysis (Fig. 1B). Histomorphometry revealed marked decreases in Oc.S/BS, N.Oc/BS, and ES/BS (Fig. 1C) and also marked decreases in Ob.S/BS, MAR, and BFR/BS in the secondary trabecular area in femurs in OYC1-treated mice (Fig. 1C). Because OYC2 exhibited no effect on bone mass (Fig. 1, A–C), we used vehicle (PBS) as a negative control in the following experiments. To establish a simple method for increasing bone mass, various doses (0.5, 1, 1.5, 5, and 15 mg/kg) of OYC1 were injected subcutaneously once in female mice, and femurs and sera were obtained for analysis after 2 weeks. SXA and pQCT analyses showed that the total BMD in the femurs was augmented significantly at doses of 5 and 15 mg/kg OYC1 (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Micro-CT analysis of the femurs confirmed marked augmentation of bone mass at 5 and 15 mg/kg OYC1 (Fig. 2B). Histomorphometric analysis of the distal femoral metaphysis in mice given 5 and 15 mg/kg OYC1 also showed significant decreases in Ob.S/BS, Oc.S/BS, N.Oc/BS, and ES/BS (Fig. 2C). Consistent with these results, serum TRAP-5b and ALP decreased to similar levels at 5 and 15 mg/kg OYC1 (Fig. 2D). There was no difference in the serum calcium concentration at any dose of OYC1 (data not shown). Pharmacokinetic studies showed rapid clearance of OYC1 at doses of 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg but significantly higher serum concentrations of OYC1 of >40 and >100 μg/ml at 5 and 15 mg/kg, respectively (Fig. 2D). Denosumab has been characterized as a drug with long term efficacy in clinical trials (31Bekker P.J. Holloway D.L. Rasmussen A.S. Murphy R. Martin S.W. Leese P.T. Holmes G.B. Dunstan C.R. DePaoli A.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The concentration of denosumab in serum remained high for a week after injection in hRANKL knock-in mice (24Kostenuik P.J. Nguyen H.Q. McCabe J. Warmington K.S. Kurahara C. Sun N. Chen C. Li L. Cattley R.C. Van G. Scully S. Elliott R. Grisanti M. Morony S. Tan H.L. Asuncion F. Li X. Ominsky M.S. Stolina M. Dwyer D. Dougall W.C. Hawkins N. Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Sullivan J.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2009; 24: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To examine the duration of efficacy of OYC1, we examined the time course of the effects of OYC1 in mice by measuring total BMD, and the concentrations of serum TRAP-5b, ALP, and OYC1 between days 4 and 28 (Fig. 3, A–C). OYC1 significantly elevated femoral total BMD in a time-dependent manner from days 4 to 28 after a single subcutaneous injection (Fig. 3A). Expansion of the dense bone structure in the trabecular area was accompanied by augmentation of total BMD, which was sustained until day 28 (Fig. 3, A and B). Surprisingly, the concentrations of OYC1 remained at >50 μg/ml in serum until day 14 and at >10 μg/ml until day 28 (Fig. 3C). Maintenance of the high OYC1 concentration resulted in a continued increase in bone mass daily until day 28 (Fig. 3, A and B). To confirm this long term effect of OYC1, biomarkers of bone turnover were examined. OYC1 markedly decreased serum TRAP-5b and ALP levels on day 4, and these levels then remained constant until day 28 (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the TRAP-5b level in the OYC1-treated mice was almost undetectable between days 4 and 28 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the ALP level in the treated mice was reduced to half the level of the vehicle between days 4 and 28 (Fig. 3C). To examine the time course of the effects of OYC1 in more detail in the early period, sera and femurs were collected on days 1–4. Analyses showed that OYC1 significantly increased total BMD in the trabecular area on day 2 and then increased BMD in a time-dependent manner, consistent with micro-CT imaging data (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, a marked decrease of serum TRAP-5b was observed on day 1, with no change in ALP apparent on day 1 (Fig. 4C). The significant decrease of ALP following that of TRAP-5b indicated down-regulation of bone turnover. Concentrations of OYC1 in serum declined from day 1 to day 4 but were still >90 μg/ml on day 4 (Fig. 4C). To investigate whether the serum TRAP-5b level reflected the conditions of osteoclasts, histological sections of the trabecular bone in tibia of the OYC1-treated mice were stained for TRAP (Fig. 4D). Consistent with the decrease in serum TRAP-5b, there were less TRAP-positive cells (osteoclasts) in the trabecular bone in the OYC1-treated mice on day 1, and only a few osteoclasts were observed in the trabecular bone on day 4. Optimization of the dose and time course effects of OYC1 was performed with the goal of establishing a method for making an osteoclast-depleted mouse model. The above results indicate that single administration of 5 mg/kg OYC1 is suitable for depletion of osteoclasts from days 4 to 28. To examine the bone anabolic effect of PTH in the osteoclast-depleted mice, PTH was injected daily for 2 weeks into mice that had been treated with OYC1 for 4 days. pQCT analysis revealed that administration of PTH and OYC1 increased the total BMD in trabecular bone independently and synergistically (PBS, 465 ± 24; PTH, 607 ± 8; OYC1, 634 ± 40; PTH + OYC1, 719 ± 14 mg/cm3) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the total BMD in cortical bone was augmented in the PTH groups (PTH and PTH + OYC1) but not with OYC1 treatment alone (PBS, 981 ± 7; PTH, 1001 ± 7; OYC1, 978 ± 17; PTH + OYC1, 1013 ± 15 mg/cm3) (Fig. 5B). The robust depletion of osteoclasts did not affect the anabolic effect of PTH on trabecular and cortical bones. PTH and OYC1 also tended to increase the cortical area, cortical thickness, and polar-SSI, indicating a synergistic effect on bone strength (Table 1). Micro-CT images confirmed the marked increases in trabecular bone mass in mice treated with PTH or OYC1 alone and the synergistic increase with treatment with PTH + OYC1 (Fig. 5C).TABLE 1Effects of PTH, OYC1, and PTH + OYC1 on cortical bone indices in treated micePBSPTHOYC1PTH + OYC1Cortical area0.665 ± 0.016 mm20.752 ± 0.028 mm2ap < 0.01 versus PBS (ANOVA).0.700 ± 0.040 mm2bp < 0.05 versus PBS (ANOVA).0.778 ± 0.021 mm2ap < 0.01 versus PBS (ANOVA).Cortical thickness0.314 ± 0.012 mm0.326 ±"

Although previous studies suggested a role for the Akt kinase in coupling the T cell antigen receptor and CD28 to NF-κB activation in T cells, the nature of the role of Akt in this pathway is still unclear. Using a targeted gene profiling approach, we found that a subset of NF-κB-dependent genes required Akt for optimal up-regulation during T cell activation. The selective effects of Akt were manifest at the level of mRNA transcription and p65/RelA binding to upstream promoters and appear to be due to altered formation of the Carma1-Bcl10 complex. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α was found to be particularly sensitive to Akt inhibition or knockdown, including in primary human blood T cells and a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis. Our findings are consistent with a hierarchy in the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes, controlled by the strength and/or duration of NF-κB signaling. More broadly, our results suggest that defining the more graded effects of signaling, such as those demonstrated here for Akt and the NF-κB pathway, is important to understanding how cells can fine-tune signaling responses for optimal sensitivity and specificity.

The proto-oncogenic kinase known as Akt (or protein kinase B) is a serine/threonine kinase activated downstream of the lipid kinase PI3 kinase, which is recruited to ligated growth factor and antigen receptors. Dysregulation of the Akt pathway has been demonstrated in numerous cancers, including some leukemias and lymphomas (1Uddin S. Hussain A. Al-Hussein K. Platanias L.C. Bhatia K.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 932-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 2Gold M.R. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 104-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and many downstream targets for Akt have been described (3Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4571) Google Scholar). Previous reports from our laboratory and others demonstrated that one downstream effect of Akt activation is NF-κB-dependent transcription (4Narayan P. Holt B. Tosti R. Kane L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2327-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but it is still not known what role NF-κB plays in Akt-dependent biological processes overall. Most previous studies, including our own, relied on gain of function approaches to show that Akt can be sufficient to up-regulate NF-κB-dependent transcription. Thus, the degree to which Akt is actually necessary for NF-κB induction during T cell activation is not clear and, indeed, controversial. NF-κB family transcription factors reside in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells as homo- or heterodimers in complexes with the IκB proteins. Upon stimulation, phosphorylation by IKK 2The abbreviations used are: IKKIκB kinaseUbubiquitinationTCRT cell receptor for antigen. triggers IκB degradation, which promotes NF-κB factor translocation to the nucleus followed by their binding to and activation of transcription from numerous genes (5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of gene transcription by NF-κB is more complex than this simple model suggests, and it is now clear that multiple levels of regulation exist to yield the known stimulation- and cell type-specific patterns of NF-κB gene expression (6Smale S.T. Cell. 2010; 140: 833-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For example, differences in the magnitude, duration, and/or periodicity of NF-κB activation have been shown to contribute to the up-regulation of different subsets of NF-κB-dependent genes by different receptors (7Ashall L. Horton C.A. Nelson D.E. Paszek P. Harper C.V. Sillitoe K. Ryan S. Spiller D.G. Unitt J.F. Broomhead D.S. Kell D.B. Rand D.A. Sée V. White M.R.

Recently, the development of more potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of Akt has facilitated the study of Akt function both in vitro and in vivo, although these have mostly been explored as possible cancer therapies (12Cheng J.Q.

Anticancer Drugs. 2007; 18: 861-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here we have employed the compound Akti 1/2, an allosteric inhibitor that stabilizes the inactive conformation of both Akt1 and Akt2 but not Akt3 (14Barnett S.F. Defeo-Jones D. Fu S. Hancock P.J. Haskell K.M. Jones R.E. Kahana J.A. Kral A.M. Leander K. Lee L.L. Malinowski J. McAvoy E.M. Nahas D.D. Robinson R.G. Huber H.E. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We previously showed that this compound is an effective inhibitor of Akt activation in T cells, at least under conditions of short-term stimulation (4Narayan P. Holt B. Tosti R. Kane L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2327-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We also used the complementary approach of knocking down Akt1 and Akt2 with siRNA. In this study, using targeted gene array analysis, we analyzed the program of NF-κB-dependent gene expression induced during T cell activation and established a subset of genes that requires Akt for its up-regulation. Our findings demonstrate that Akt fine-tunes NF-κB-dependent transcription by the TCR and CD28, with only a subset of genes sensitive to the loss of Akt activity. Importantly, we provide mechanistic evidence that the difference between Akt-sensitive and Akt-insensitive NF-κB target genes is due to quantitative effects of Akt on NF-κB induction. Finally, using this approach, we have identified and validated the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α as a particularly sensitive target for Akt inhibition in T cells.

CD4+ T cells were isolated from lymph nodes and spleens from 6- to 12-week-old DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice with the murine T cell purification kit from Miltenyi Biotec (and stimulated in 24-well plates coated with anti-Syrian hamster IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), anti-mouse CD3 (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen), and anti-mouse CD28 (5 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Th1 cells were differentiated from these cells in the presence of mouse IL-12 (5 ng/ml, BD Biosciences), anti-mouse IL-4 (10 ng/ml; BioLegend), and rhIL2 (25 IU/ml). For transfection, T cells were resuspended at 35 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 without supplements.

The resulting construct was verified by automated sequencing. Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA in addition to protease inhibitors 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and leupeptin, all used according to the manufacturer's recommendations (EMD Biosciences), and phosphatase inhibitors (sodium orthovanadate (EMD Biosciences) and β-glycerol phosphate (Sigma)). For analysis of Ub, lysis buffer was also supplemented with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Western blotting was carried out as described previously (4Narayan P. Holt B. Tosti R. Kane L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2327-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were developed with SuperSignal West Pico substrate (Pierce/Thermo Scientific) and imaged on a Kodak Image Station 2000R.

Alternatively, the level of secreted TNF-α in D10 T cell or bone marrow-derived macrophage cell culture supernatants in some experiments was measured using a commercial mouse TNF-α ELISA kit from BioLegend. Whole heparinized human blood was obtained from the Central Blood Bank (Pittsburgh, PA). Anti-CD3ϵ (1 μg/ml), anti-CD28 (10 ng/ml), and IL-2 (1:2000 dilution of recombinant human IL-2) were added to whole blood diluted 1:1 in RPMI 1640 and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Binding of nuclear p65/RelA to an NF-κB DNA consensus sequence was measured using a commercially available kit (NF-κB p65 EZ-TFA transcription factor assay (Millipore, Temecula, CA). This method was used as an alternative to the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and has been reported to be sensitive and specific (16Shen Z. Peedikayil J. Olson G.K. Siebert P.D. Fang Y. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ChIP assays for NF-κB p65 were performed using a ChIP assay kit (USB, Cleveland, OH) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PCR was performed using primers complementary to two sites flanking an approximately 300-bp fragment of the murine TNF-α promoter between nucleotides −434 and −722 relative to the transcription start site and encoding κB sites 2 and 2a: 5′-AGTCATACGGATTGGGAGAAATCCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′AGTTCTTGGAGGAAGTGGCTG-AAGGCA-3′ (reverse). For IκBa, the primers were ACTCTTGGGTTTTCAAAAAGATCA (forward) and GCCAGTCAGACTAGAAAAAGAACTG (reverse). The products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. IKK kinase assays were performed essentially as described previously (4Narayan P. Holt B. Tosti R. Kane L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2327-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Briefly, the IKK complex was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated or stimulated D10 T cells with an antibody to IKKβ. Immunoprecipitants were then washed into kinase buffer with GST-IκB as a substrate. Reactions were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and imaged by autoradiography. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced as described previously (18Miyamae T. Marinov A.D. Sowders D. Wilson D.C. Devlin J. Boudreau R. Robbins P. Hirsch R. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in accordance with University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee procedures. Results are presented as the mean ± S.D. Where indicated, p values were calculated using a Student's two-tailed t test, on the basis of at least three replicate experiments. We first confirmed which isoforms of Akt are expressed in T cells. Thus, we found that T cells express both Akt1 and Akt2 but do not express detectable levels of Akt3 (Fig. 1A). We next determined whether the inhibitory activity of Akti 1/2 is maintained over the time course of T cell stimulation relevant for the experiments performed below. Treatment of a murine T cell clone with Akti 1/2 (10 μm) resulted in long-lasting inhibition of Akt activation (at least 12 h), as read out by phosphorylation of Ser-473 (Fig. 1B). To help confirm the specificity of the Akt inhibitor, we tested its efficacy in an NF-κB reporter assay using cells transfected with WT Akt or a form of the kinase described previously to be resistant to the effects of Akti 1/2 (15Green C.J. Göransson O. Kular G.S. Leslie N.R. Gray A. Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Hundal H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27653-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, consistent with our previous findings (4Narayan P. Holt B. Tosti R. Kane L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2327-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), Akti 1/2 partially inhibited activation of an NF-κB reporter by TCR stimulation (Fig. 1C). This effect was also pronounced in T cells cotransfected with WT Akt but not Akt mutated so as to be resistant to the effects of the inhibitor (W80A). Although this and other findings point to Akti 1/2 being a very specific inhibitor of two of the three mammalian Akt isoforms, Akt1 and Akt2 (14Barnett S.F. Defeo-Jones D. Fu S. Hancock P.J. Haskell K.M. Jones R.E. Kahana J.A. Kral A.M. Leander K. Lee L.L. Malinowski J. McAvoy E.M. Nahas D.D. Robinson R.G. Huber H.E. Biochem.

Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2218-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we were concerned about possible off-target effects. Therefore, we also employed siRNA to knock down the expression of Akt1 and Akt2 in T cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, transfection of T cells with oligos specific for Akt1 and Akt2 resulted in significant knockdown of Akt protein, peaking at about 24 h. To test the hypothesis that Akt is selectively involved in the up-regulation of a subset of NF-κB-dependent genes in T cells, we employed targeted microarrays (“NF-κB Signaling Pathway Oligo Array” under “Experimental Procedures”) specific for 113 genes that are known targets and regulators of NF-κB signaling. Thus, T cells were pretreated with 10 μm Akti 1/2 for 1 h or transfected with Akt-specific siRNA (for 24 h) and then stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies followed by RNA isolation and preparation for array analysis. Stimulation of D10 T cells led to the up-regulation of a number of genes represented on the arrays (Fig. 2 and supplemental Figs. S1–S4). After pretreatment with Akti 1/2 or transfection of Akt1/2-specific siRNA oligos, only a subset of these genes was impaired in its up-regulation (Fig. 2 and supplemental Figs. S1–S4). Notable among these were the genes encoding the cytokines TNF-α, LIGHT (Tnfsf14), IL-6, IL-10, and GM-CSF (Csf2), which were similarly affected by both the Akt inhibitor and siRNA treatment (genes highlighted in bold type). Importantly, some known NF-κB targets were not affected by either the Akt inhibitor or siRNA, for example, the genes encoding IκBa (Nfkbia) and ICAM1 (Fig. 2 (genes highlighted with asterisks) and supplemental Figs. S1 and S3). To validate the results obtained with the microarrays, we examined the expression of the genes highlighted above with quantitative RT-PCR. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed our initial observation that increases in the messages encoding IκBα and ICAM1 were not affected by Akt inhibition or knockdown (Fig. 3, A and B). Importantly, these experiments also confirmed that the CD3/CD28-induced expression of the genes encoding TNF-α (Fig. 3C), LIGHT (D), IL-6 (E), IL-10 (F) and GM-CSF (G) were all inhibited by treatment with 10 μm Akti 1/2 (left panels) or transfection with Akt1/2 siRNA oligos (right panels). Thus, modulation of Akt activity or expression indeed results in selective effects on known NF-κB target genes. Given the particularly striking difference between the effects of Akt modulation on up-regulation of the genes encoding IκBα versus TNF-α, we examined these genes more carefully for a specific connection to their transcriptional regulation by NF-κB. NF-κB is a well known regulator of TNF-α transcription through multiple NF-κB-binding sites in the TNF-α promoter (20Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 21Trede N.S. Tsytsykova A.V. Chatila T. Goldfeld A.E. Geha R.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 902-908PubMed Google Scholar). We performed a ChIP analysis of the endogenous TNF-α promoter before and after CD3/CD28 stimulation, with or without the inhibitor Akti 1/2. As shown in Fig. 4A (left panel), stimulation of D10 T cells led to increased NF-κB p65 binding to the TNF-α promoter. This activity was significantly impaired in the presence of Akti 1/2, with the effects over three experiments quantified in Fig. 4A (right panel). To further solidify the link between Akt, NF-κB, and gene expression, we performed a ChIP analysis for p65 binding to the promoter of the IκB gene (Nfkbia), expression of which was not affected by Akt inhibition (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Thus, as shown in Fig. 4B, CD3/CD28 stimulation led to increased p65 binding to the IκB promoter, which was not inhibited by Akti 1/2. These results demonstrate that inhibition of Akt1 and Akt2 inhibits transcription from the TNF-α promoter in T cells, at least in part through decreased NF-κB DNA binding. However, binding of p65 to the IκB promoter under the same conditions was not affected. Thus, the transcriptional differences described above were due at least in part to direct effects on NF-κB promoter binding. To better understand the selective effects of Akt inhibition/knockdown on NF-κB promoter binding, we further probed the role of Akt in the NF-κB signaling pathway. As shown in Fig. 5A, Akti 1/2 significantly (but not completely) inhibited nuclear entry and DNA binding of p65 induced by stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies, at least at this 2-h time point. However, when the kinetics of the response were examined, we did observe an eventual increase in p65 nuclear entry and DNA oligo binding at later time points in the presence of the Akt inhibitor (Fig. 5B), despite the fact that inhibition of Akt activity was maintained (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the altered kinetics of p65 nuclear entry and DNA binding, we found that inhibition of Akt led to a delay, but not absence, of CD3/CD28-induced degradation of IκBα (Fig. 5C). Thus, consistent with previous studies on the selective control of gene expression by different NF-κB-activating receptors (6Smale S.T. Cell. 2010; 140: 833-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), Akt-mediated differences in NF-κB kinetics appear to be translated into specific effects on CD3/CD28-mediated gene expression. We next worked backwards in the NF-κB pathway to better understand where Akt inhibition was impinging on normal NF-κB induction. IκBα degradation requires phosphorylation by the IKK complex (5Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). Indeed, when we measured IKK kinase activity with an in vitro assay, we noted that CD3/CD28-induced IKK activity was impaired in the presence of Akti 1/2 (Fig. 6A). The dynamic range of this kinase assay is not particularly large in our experience, which may account for the apparently larger effect on kinase activity compared with IκB degradation. Activation of the IKK complex requires both phosphorylation of IKKα/β and Ub of IKKγ/NF-κB essential modulator. Blotting stimulated T cell lysates with a phospho-specific antibody to IKKα/β revealed little if any difference in magnitude or kinetics of phosphorylation in the presence or absence of the Akt inhibitor (Fig. 6B). However, when we examined Lys-63-linked Ub of IKKγ, we did note effects of the inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 6C, anti-CD3/CD28 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate /ionomycin stimulation increased the amount of Lys-63-Ub on IKKγ. Use of Akti 1/2 in this assay revealed two differences: a slight but reproducible increase in the basal amount of Ub and a decrease in the induced Ub, particularly at the 30-min time point. Because CD3/CD28-mediated Ub of IKKγ requires assembly of a multiprotein complex containing Carma1and Bcl10 (22Shambharkar P.B. Blonska M. Pappu B.P. Li H. You Y. Sakurai H. Darnay B.G. Hara H. Penninger J. Lin X. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1794-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we reasoned that formation of this complex might be impaired by Akt inhibition. T cells were stimulated with or without Akti 1/2, and endogenous Bcl10 was immunoprecipitated, followed by Western blotting for Carma1. Thus, as shown in Fig. 5E, stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies led to an increase in the amount of Carma1 coimmunoprecipitated with Bcl10, and this was severely impaired in the presence of Akti 1/2. As with the IKK kinase assay discussed above, the dynamic range of this coimmunoprecipitation assay is rather modest, which likely explains the apparent severity of the inhibition. The results discussed above suggest that Akt inhibition may have selective effects on cytokine production by effector T cells. To address this further at the protein level, we determined the role of Akt in the secretion of a panel of cytokines known to be made by the D10 T cell clone using a multiplex bead-based approach. Thus, we stimulated D10 T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies in the presence of different concentrations of Akti 1/2 (1, 10, or 20 μm) to determine the relative sensitivity of different cytokines to the inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 7A, there was a preferential effect on certain cytokines at lower doses of the compound. Interestingly, some of the canonical Th2 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and GM-CSF but not IL-13, appeared to be more resistant to the effects of Akti 1/2 relative to IL-6 and especially TNF-α. A comparative analysis where the data are normalized (Fig. 7B) suggests that these cytokine break down into two classes with respect to sensitivity to Akt inhibition, resulting in a shift of the dose response curve of approximately one log. Given the clinical relevance of TNF-α (23Bradley J.R. J. Pathol. 2008; 214: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar), and the complex post-transcriptional control of TNF-α message (24Anderson P. Phillips K. Stoecklin G. Kedersha N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Clark A. Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we further assessed the effects of Akt inhibition on TNF-α protein in T cells from different sources. To confirm the results obtained with the multiplex approach in Fig. 7, we measured TNF-α secretion with a sensitive ELISA. As shown in Fig. 8A, TNF-α secretion by D10 T cells was profoundly inhibited by Akti 1/2, consistent with results discussed above. In addition, we used this approach to measure TNF-α production by T cells transfected with siRNA against Akt1 and Akt2. Consistent with the less-than-complete knockdown of Akt (Fig. 1), we observed significant, although not complete, inhibition of TNF-α production. Similar results were observed with polyclonal Th1 T cells, although the overall level of TNF-α production by these cells was lower (Fig. 8B). Next, we examined the effects of Akt inhibition on production of TNF-α following anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation of whole human blood. Such an assay is often used for identifying the potential clinical utility of small molecule inhibitors of kinases, in the more complex environment of whole blood (26Changelian P.S. Moshinsky D. Kuhn C.F. Flanagan M.E. Munchhof M.J. Harris T.M. Whipple D.A. Doty J.L. Sun J. Kent C.R. Magnuson K.S. Perregaux D.G. Sawyer P.S. Kudlacz E.M. Blood. 2008; 111: 2155-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8C, anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation of whole blood resulted in production of TNF-α, presumably mostly from T cells, and this was significantly inhibited by Akti 1/2 (white bars). Although there was substantially more TNF-α produced after stimulation of whole blood cultures with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, which bypass receptor-proximal signaling pathways, this was not inhibited by Akti 1/2 (Fig. 8C, black bars). This important control helps to confirm the specificity of the Akt inhibitor and its lack of general toxicity. Finally, we examined the effect of Akt inhibition on antigen-specific TNF-α production by T cells from a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, mice were immunized with type II collagen and followed for development of joint swelling (18Miyamae T. Marinov A.D. Sowders D. Wilson D.C. Devlin J. Boudreau R. Robbins P. Hirsch R. J.

Upon identification of animals with inflammation, draining lymph nodes and spleens were harvested, and cells were restimulated in vitro with antigen. As shown in Fig. 8D, addition of antigen (type II collagen) to lymph node cultures (white bars) led to increased secretion of TNF-α, compared with unstimulated (no antigen) cultures. This secretion was inhibited by all doses of Akti 1/2 (from 1–20 μm, shaded bars). We also noted significant inhibition by Akti 1/2 of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated TNF-α production in these cultures of"

However, while the role of p53 in controlling normal cell cycle progression and tumor suppression is well established, the clinical significance of p53 isoform expression is unknown. A novel bioinformatic analysis of p53 isoform expression in 68 patients with acute myeloid leukemia revealed distinct p53 protein biosignatures correlating with clinical outcome. Furthermore, we show that mutated FLT3, a prognostic marker for short survival in AML, is associated with expression of full-length p53. In contrast, mutated NPM1, a prognostic marker for long-term survival, correlated with p53 isoforms β and γ expression. In conclusion, p53 biosignatures contain useful information for cancer evaluation and prognostication."

On the other hand, C1q levels can decline in systemic lupus erythematosus patients without apparent C1q gene defects and the versatility in C1q production is a likely cause. As an 18-subunit protein, C1q is assembled in a 1:1:1 ratio from three different subunits. The three human C1q genes are closely bundled on chromosome 1 (C1qA-C1qC-C1qB) and their basal and IFNγ-stimulated expression, largely restricted to macrophages and dendritic cells, is apparently synchronized. We cloned the three gene promoters and observed that although the C1qB promoter exhibited basal and IFNγ-stimulated activities consistent with the endogenous C1qB gene, the activities of the cloned C1qA and C1qC promoters were suppressed by IFNγ. To certain extents, these were corrected when the C1qB promoter was cloned at the 3′ end across the luciferase reporter gene. A 53-bp element is essential to the activities of the C1qB promoter and the transcription factors PU.1 and IRF8 bound to this region. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, the C1qB promoter was co-precipitated with PU.1 and IRF8. shRNA knockdown of PU.1 and IRF8 diminished C1qB promoter response to IFNγ.

Immunol. 1987; 138: 739-745PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gordon M.M. Lucie N. Porter D. Lupus. 2000; 9: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Besides, diverse microbial structures, cytokines, hormones, and drugs affect C1q production (19Lu J.H. Teh B.K. Wang L. Wang Y.N. Tan Y.S. Lai M.C. Reid K.B. Cell Mol. Immunol. 2008; 5: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which can contribute to the decline of C1q levels in SLE patients. C1q is a delicate 18-subunit assembly in 1:1:1 ratio from three types of subunits (29Reid K.B. Porter R.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The C1q genes are highly clustered (C1qA-C1qC-C1qB) within a genomic region of ∼25 kb (30Sellar G.C. Blake D.J. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). How the transcription of these three genes is synchronized in macrophages and DCs is relevant to SLE pathogenesis but remains to be investigated. Here, we report a 53-bp region in the C1q gene cluster that responds to IFNγ through PU.1 and IRF8, two DC/macrophage-associated transcription factors, and potentially regulates all three genes from the center of this gene cluster. The transcription start site (TSS) for each C1q gene was determined using the RLM-RACE kit (Invitrogen) with RNA isolated from cultured human macrophages (1–5 μg) (21Teh B.K. Yeo J.G. Chern L.M. Lu J. Mol. Immunol. 2011; 48: 1128-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After dephosphorylation with calf intestinal phosphatase, RNA was decapped at the 5′ end with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase and a 44-bp GeneRacer RNA oligo was then ligated to the 5′ ends. cDNA was synthesized from the RNA using C1q gene-specific primers (supplemental data). 5′ end sequences were PCR-amplified using common forward primers embedded in the GeneRacer oligonucleotides and respective reverse gene-specific primers (supplemental data). The PCR products were cloned using the TOPO cloning reaction kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing reagents (Applied Biosystems). Putative promoter for each C1q gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA to include the TSS, an extensive 5′ region (>2 kb) and a short 3′ region. The primers were flanked by restriction sites: C1qA (5′-gcggtaccaggcagcactcagctcacattac-3′/5′-gcctcgagttgtcaactccaactggatgct-3′, KpnI/XhoI), C1qB (5′-ccgctagcaggtgagggggtgtaggtttctt-3′/5′-ccgctagcaggtgagggggtgtaggtttctt-3′, NheI/HindIII), and C1qC (5′-ccgctagccttcacacccacagacacactca-3′/5′-ccaagcttgcaggtgggcggtttctgc-3′, NheI/HindIII). The PCR products were cloned into the pGL3-basic vector in conjunction with the 3′ firefly luciferase reporter gene (Promega). This yields the pGL3-C1qA-Luc, pGL3-C1qB-Luc, and pGL3-C1qC-Luc plasmids with 2407, 2477, and 2594 bp promoter sequences, respectively. These cloned C1q gene promoters were transfected into the mouse RAW264.7 macrophage cells (ATCC) following a published protocol (31Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Briefly, RAW264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C, and 5% CO2. For transfection, cells were harvested and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (2.5 × 107 cells/ml). The C1q promoter plasmid (10 μg) was mixed in a 40-μl volume with the pRL-β-actin promoter plasmid (1 μg). In a 4-mm cuvette, the plasmid mix was further mixed with RAW264.7 cells (0.4 ml), which was then pulsed in the Gene Pulser Xcell system (Bio-Rad) at 300 V with 975 μF capacitance and infinite resistance. The cells were left stand for 5 min and then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (8.5 ml) containing 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10 μm chloroquine. Cells were cultured in 48-well plates (0.5 ml/well) overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and then changed to fresh RPMI 1640 medium (1 ml/well) where chloroquine was replaced by 1.2% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. After 24 h, luciferase activities were measured. Where cells were stimulated with mouse IFNγ (10 ng/ml), it was added 4 h after the change of medium. The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) was used to determine firefly luciferase expression resulting from the C1q gene promoters and constitutive Renilla luciferase expression under a β-actin promoter. The transfected RAW264.7 cells, with or without IFNγ treatments, were washed in PBS and lysed in the passive lysis buffer (65 μl/well) for 45 min with shaking. The cell lysate (2 μl) was first mixed with the firefly luciferase substrate (luciferase assay reagent II, 25 μl) and then measured in the TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). The Renilla luciferase substrate was then added (Stop & Glo, 25 μl) to measure the control β-actin promoter activity. Relative luciferase activity was calculated for each experiment (firefly luciferase reading/Renilla luciferase reading × 100), and data were presented as mean ± S.D. of triple experiments. Potential cis-acting regions in the cloned C1q gene promoters were initially mapped by 5′ and 3′ deletions of the promoters. Specified regions were PCR-amplified using primers listed in supplemental data. 5′ deletion of the pGL-C1qB-Luc vector to −273 bp yielded a basic C1qB gene promoter (B273). Point mutations were introduced to the B273 promoter using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primers listed in supplemental Table S4. In some experiments, the B273 promoter was cloned at the 3′ end of the firefly luciferase gene with C1qA or C1qC promoters at the 5′ end. Oligonucleotides representing PU.1, IRF1, IRF8, and STAT1 target sequences (supplemental data) were synthesized, and double-stranded DNA was generated by annealing complementary oligonucleotides. These were cloned into the pSUPER.basic vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). To transfect RAW264.7 cells, each shRNA plasmid (10 μg) was mixed with the B273 plasmid (1 μg) and the control β-actin promoter plasmid (1 μg) in a 40-μl volume for electroporation. Cells were cultured to measure luciferase activities. To evaluate shRNA knockdown of the transcription factors, cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting. To detect PU.1, IRF1, IRF8, and STAT1, shRNA-transfected RAW264.7 cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After clearing by centrifugation, proteins were separated on 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gels and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes. The blots were blocked for 1 h in TBS (50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies specific for mouse PU.1, IRF1, IRF8, and STAT1 (#9172, rabbit; Cell Signaling Tech. Inc., Danvers, MA) and, as a control, with a β-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The PU.1 (H-135, rabbit), IRF1 (C-20, rabbit), and IRF8 (C-19, goat) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). After washing, the blots were incubated for 2 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed using the Immuno-Star AP substrate (Bio-Rad). A double-stranded, 53-bp DNA fragment (−133 to −81 bp) was generated by annealing a sense oligonucleotide (5′-ctcatttacagtaaatccagtgggttgcagaaataggacctgaaactgcctga-3′) and a biotinylated antisense oligonucleotide (5′-biotin-tcaggcagtttcaggtcctatttctgcaacccactggatttactgtaaatgag-3′). The two oligonucleotides were mixed at 1 pmol/μl each in an annealing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl) and after boiling for 5 min were cooled to room temperature. On the other hand, nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW264.7 cells, with or without IFNγ treatment, using the NE-PER nuclear extraction reagents (Thermo Scientific, Rockfold, IL). Streptavidin-agarose resins (50 μl of packed volume) were washed and resuspended in 100 μl of TEN buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl). Half of the resins were mixed with the 53-bp probe (30 μl) overnight at 4 °C and, as a control, the other half of the resins were mixed with the annealing buffer. After washing once with TEN buffer and twice with TGEDN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100), the resins were resuspended in 0.5 ml of TGEDN buffer and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with the nuclear extract (200 μg proteins) and sonicated salmon sperm DNA (25 μg). The resins were washed five times each with 0.5 ml of 0.5× TGEDN buffer and resuspended in 50 μl of elution buffer (0.5% (w/v) SDS and 1 m NaCl). Proteins were eluted by heating at 50 °C for 20 min and then separated on 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gels. As controls, total nuclear extracts were loaded on the gels. Precipitated PU.1, IRF1, IRF8, and STAT1 were detected by Western blotting. Macrophages (∼1 × 107) were cultured in a 100-mm plate with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (20 ng/ml) (21Teh B.K. Yeo J.G. Chern L.M. Lu J. Mol. Immunol. 2011; 48: 1128-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On day 6, cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde to 1% (w/v). After gently mixing for 10 min, reactions were stopped by adding glycine to 150 mm. After 5 min, cells were washed three times with PBS, harvested, and resuspended in 1 ml of L1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 5 min, the insoluble nuclear fraction was pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of L2 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS, and protease inhibitors), and 0.2-ml aliquots were made in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Sonication was performed in the Bioruptor at its high setting (Diagenode, Inc., Liege, Belgium) for 15 cycles (30 s on/30 s off) in an ice bath. Soluble nuclear lysate was obtained by centrifugation for 30 s at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C. The nuclear lysate (50 μg) was diluted 1:10 with a dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 m NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). A 1:10 dilution of the L2 buffer was used in further incubation and washing steps. Protein A-Sepharose resins (20 μl) were washed and mixed for 3 h at 4 °C with the PU.1, IRF1, IRF8, or STAT1 antibody (10 μg/ml). The resins were similarly incubated with non-immune rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) and used to absorb the nuclear lysate for 3 h at 4 °C. After addition of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (25 μg), the preabsorbed lysate was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with resins loaded with the PU.1, IRF8, STAT1, or IRF1 antibodies or, as controls, resins loaded with the anti-His antibody or resins without antibody. The resins were washed five times with buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and three times with buffer B (buffer A with an additional 0.5 m NaCl). Bound nuclear materials were eluted for 4 h at 65 °C in 0.1 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiolthreitol, and 1% (w/v) SDS). Eluted DNA was enriched using the GFX PCR and gel band purification kit (GE Healthcare). The presence of C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC promoter sequences was determined by PCR using specific primers: C1qA (5′-cgcccaatgtcccagtctt-3′/5′-gttgtcaactccaactggat-3′), C1qB (5′-tgagttggcagaaccaaa-3′/5′-agcaggctggcccctttc-3′), C1qC (5′-aaagtgtcaagtcagggaaa-3′/5′-tgcaggtgggcggtttct-3′). PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels. The fact that C1q is assembled in a 1:1:1 ratio from its C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC subunits (29Reid K.B. Porter R.R. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) demands synchronized transcription of the three C1q genes. Furthermore, these mechanisms apparently also ensure that C1q gene transcription is largely restricted to DCs and macrophages. As shown in Fig. 1A, DCs constitutively express all three mRNA species that were, after IFNγ treatment, all up-regulated (Fig. 1A). Similar basal and IFNγ-stimulated expression of the three C1q mRNA species was observed in macrophages (Fig. 1B). The magnitudes of up-regulation were the highest with the C1qB mRNA and the lowest for C1qA mRNA. Overall, the three C1q genes showed largely coordinated basal and IFNγ-stimulated transcription. Mechanistically, this could be achieved by having similar relevant cis-acting elements in all three gene promoters. The fact that the three genes are in a rare but highly conserved chromosomal cluster (Fig. 2) implies that synchronization may also be achieved through a core element inside this gene cluster (30Sellar G.C. Blake D.J. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Hu Y.L. Pan X.M. Xiang L.X. Shao J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 28777-28786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Basal and IFNγ-stimulated activities of the C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC gene promoters. The anticipated promoter regions for C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC were specified and cloned into the pGL3-basic vector (A). The cloned C1qA (B), C1qB (C), and C1qC (D) gene promoters were transfected into RAW264.7 cells to measure the basal activities, and cells were treated with mouse IFNγ (10 ng/ml) to measure IFNγ-stimulated activities. After 5′ deletions, the shortened promoters were examined similarly. In each experiment, a Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid under the β-actin promoter was co-transfected to normalize the firefly luciferase activities derived from C1q promoters. Data were presented as means ± S.D. of triplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the first hypothesis, i.e. that the three C1q gene promoters function independently and synchronization is achieved by having the relevant cis-acting elements duplicated in all three promoters, these promoters were each cloned into a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-basic) and transfected into the mouse RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Cloning was performed after validation of the TSS for each C1q gene by RLM-RACE (supplemental data). In the transfected RAW264.7 cells, the three promoters displayed varying degrees of basal activity with the C1qB promoter being many times stronger than the C1qC promoter (Fig. 2). Similar to its endogenous counterpart (Fig. 1), the cloned C1qB promoter was highly inducible by IFNγ (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the cloned C1qC promoter dramatically departed from the activity of its endogenous counterpart by exhibiting weak basal activity, which was further suppressed by IFNγ (Fig. 2). The C1qA promoter was also suppressed by IFNγ. These results are not in favor of the first hypothesis that synchronized transcription is achieved by having the relevant cis-acting element duplicated in the three independent C1q gene promoters. A series of 5′ deletions were introduced in the C1qA and C1qC gene promoters in an attempt to determine whether specific regions exist that mediated IFNγ inhibition of these promoters. For the C1qA promoter (−2497 bp), deletions were introduced at −1800, −1067, −627, and −231 bp, whereas the C1qC promoter (−2396 bp) was truncated at −1612, −997, −615, and −258 bp. A progressive 5′ deletion of the C1qA promoter gradually increased its basal activity, e.g. the −627-bp promoter was 3-fold stronger than the −2497-bp promoter (Fig. 2B). Further deletion to −231 bp had no additional effect. However, all of these truncated C1qA promoters remained inhibited by IFNγ, showing that the remaining promoter region of the C1qA gene, despite the increased basal activity, still lacks adequate cis-acting elements to confer IFNγ induction as observed in the endogenous C1qA gene. Deletion of the C1qC promoter from −2396 to −1612 bp dramatically raised the otherwise trivial basal activity, but further deletion to −997, −615, and −258 bp had no additional effects (Fig. 2D). All of these truncated promoters also remained inhibited by IFNγ. It should be noted that even the raised basal activity of the truncated C1qC promoter remained much lower than that of the C1qB promoter. Furthermore, the truncated C1qA and C1qC promoters remained inhibited by IFNγ. It shows that the C1qA and C1qC genes are not effectively regulated by their 5′ regions upstream of the TSS, and additional endogenous mechanisms may exist, in the chromosomal context, for synchronized transcription of the three C1q genes. Similar 5′ deletions of the C1qB promoter (−2303 bp) at −1724, −1068, or −684 bp did not affect its strong basal and IFNγ-stimulated activities. Deletion to −273 bp only slightly reduced its basal activity, but the IFNγ-stimulated activity remained intact. Deletion further to −37 bp halved the basal activity, but it completely eliminated the IFNγ-stimulated activity (Fig. 2C). It suggests that the 236-bp region between −273 and −37 bp is responsible for its IFNγ-stimulated activity and may also partially contributes to its basal activity (Fig. 2C). Inspection of this region using the MatInspector program (Genomatix), revealed a TSS-proximal chimeric GAS-ISRE sequence and a c-Rel site further upstream (Fig. 3). 5′ deletion to −141 bp removed the c-Rel site but still retained the GAS-ISRE sequences in the promoter. This slightly reduced the IFNγ-stimulated activity (Fig. 4A). However, deleting a further 8 bp to −133 bp began to impair the IFNγ-stimulated activity: a 50% reduction compared with the −273-bp promoter (Fig. 4A), suggesting a significant contribution of the 11-bp segment between −144 and −133 bp, which is 5′ outside of the GAS-ISRE region, to the ability of the promoter to respond to IFNγ. Deletion of another 8 to −125 bp still maintained the integrity of the GAS-ISRE region (Fig. 4B), but it completely abolished the IFNγ-stimulated activity (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the putative GAS-ISRE region is inadequate for the IFNγ response of the C1qB gene if it plays any roles.FIGURE 4Identification of a 53-bp IFNγ-stimulated cis-acting element in the C1qB promoter. A, further 5′ deletions of the B273 promoter at −144, −133, −125, and −119 bp were made to identify the 5′ boundary of the IFNγ-stimulated region in the C1qB promoter. B, 3′ deletions were made at −28, −45, −72, −81, and −90 bp to identify the 3′ boundary of the IFNγ-stimulated site. C, illustration of site-directed mutagenesis of the B273 promoter to determine the involvement of specific nucleotides for B273 response to IFNγ.

Progressive deletion to −45, −72, and −81 bp showed no impairment of this IFNγ-stimulated activity (Fig. 4B). However, deletion to −90 bp, which began to disrupt the ISRE region, completely abolished IFNγ-stimulated activity. These 5′ and 3′ deletion studies identified a basic 53-bp region in the C1qB promoter (−133 to −81 bp) that was sufficient and essential to confer most of IFNγ-stimulated activity to the promoter. The involvement of different regions along this 53-bp fragment to IFNγ-stimulated activity was further evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4C). Most of these mutants showed varying degrees of impairment in the IFNγ-stimulated activity. The activity appeared to be completely abolished by some single nucleot"
https://openalex.org/W2013377366,"WNT, RAS or phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways control specific stages of ovarian follicular development. To analyze the functional interactions of these pathways in granulosa cells during follicular development in vivo, we generated specific mutant mouse models. Stable activation of the WNT signaling effector β-catenin (CTNNB1) in granulosa cells results in the formation of premalignant lesions that develop into granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) spontaneously later in life or following targeted deletion of the tumor suppressor gene Pten. Conversely, expression of oncogenic KRAS(G12D) dramatically arrests proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in granulosa cells, and consequently, small abnormal follicle-like structures devoid of oocytes accumulate in the ovary. Because of the potent anti-proliferative effects of KRAS(G12D) in granulosa cells, we sought to determine whether KRAS(G12D) would block precancerous lesion and tumor formation in follicles of the CTNNB1-mutant mice. Unexpectedly, transgenic Ctnnb1;Kras-mutant mice exhibited increased GC proliferation, decreased apoptosis and impaired differentiation and developed early-onset GCTs leading to premature death in a manner similar to the Ctnnb1;Pten-mutant mice. Microarray and reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that gene regulatory processes induced by CTNNB1 were mostly enhanced by either KRAS activation or Pten loss in remarkably similar patterns and degree. The concomitant activation of CTNNB1 and KRAS in Sertoli cells also caused testicular granulosa cell tumors that showed gene expression patterns that partially overlapped those observed in GCTs of the ovary. Although the mutations analyzed herein have not yet been linked to adult GCTs in humans, they may be related to juvenile GCTs or to tumors in other tissues where CTNNB1 is mutated. Importantly, the results provide strong evidence that CTNNB1 is the driver in these contexts and that KRAS(G12D) and Pten loss promote the program set in motion by the CTNNB1."
https://openalex.org/W2013635655,"Estrogen receptor-α (ERα, ESR1) is a pivotal transcriptional regulator of breast cancer physiology and is targeted by endocrine therapies. Loss of ERα activity or expression is an indication of endocrine resistance and is associated with increased risk of tumor recurrence and worse prognosis. In this study, we sought to investigate whether elements of the tumor microenvironment, namely macrophages, would impact on ERα and we found that macrophage-derived factors caused loss of ERα expression in breast cancer cells. Conditioned media from macrophages caused activation of several intracellular pathways in breast cancer cells of which c-Src, protein kinase c and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were essential for loss of ERα expression. Moreover, a prolonged hyperactivation of MAPK was observed. The activation of this kinase cascade resulted in recruitment of extracellular signal regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) directly to chromatin at the ESR1 gene locus in a process that was dependent upon activation and recruitment of the c-Jun transcription factor. Thus, we identify a novel mechanism for loss of ERα expression in breast cancer cells via macrophage activation of kinase cascades in the cancer cells causing transcriptional repression of the ESR1 gene by a direct chromatin action of a c-Jun/ERK2 complex. The findings in this study support an alternative mechanism, not intrinsic to the tumor cell but derived from the cross-talk with the tumor microenvironment, that could lead to endocrine resistance and might be targeted therapeutically to prevent loss of ERα expression in breast tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2166895231,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial for normal function and mechanical protection of the CNS. The choroid plexus epithelium (CPe) is primarily responsible for secreting CSF and regulating its composition by mechanisms currently not fully understood. Previously, the heteromeric KCNQ1-KCNE2 K+ channel was functionally linked to epithelial processes including gastric acid secretion and thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Here, using Kcne2–/– tissue as a negative control, we found cerebral expression of KCNE2 to be markedly enriched in the CPe apical membrane, where we also discovered expression of KCNQ1. Targeted Kcne2 gene deletion in C57B6 mice increased CPe outward K+ current 2-fold. The Kcne2 deletion-enhanced portion of the current was inhibited by XE991 (10 μM) and margatoxin (10 μM) but not by dendrotoxin (100 nM), indicating that it arose from augmentation of KCNQ subfamily and KCNA3 but not KCNA1 K+ channel activity. Kcne2 deletion in C57B6 mice also altered the polarity of CPe KCNQ1 and KCNA3 trafficking, hyperpolarized the CPe membrane by 9 ± 2 mV, and increased CSF [Cl–] by 14% compared with wild-type mice. These findings constitute the first report of CPe dysfunction caused by cation channel gene disruption and suggest that KCNE2 influences blood-CSF anion flux by regulating KCNQ1 and KCNA3 in the CPe.—Roepke, T.

https://openalex.org/W2072177265,"Erythropoietin (Epo) is widely used clinically to treat anemia associated with various clinical conditions including cancer. Data from several clinical trials suggest significant adverse effect of Epo treatment on cancer patient survival. However, controversy exists whether Epo receptor (EpoR) is functional in cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated that EpoR mRNA expression was detectable in 90.1% of 65 melanoma cell lines, and increased copy number of the Epo and EpoR loci occurred in 30 and 24.6% of 130 primary melanomas, respectively. EpoR knockdown in melanoma cells resulted in diminished ERK phosphorylation in response to Epo stimulation, decreased cell proliferation and increased response to the inhibitory effect of hypoxia and cisplatin in vitro. EpoR knockdown significantly decreased melanoma xenograft size and tumor invasion in vivo. On the contrary, constitutive activation of EpoR activated cell proliferation pathways in melanoma cells and resulted in increased cell proliferation and resistance to hypoxia and cisplatin treatment in vitro. EpoR activation resulted in significantly larger xenografts with increased tumor invasion of surrounding tissue in vivo. Daily administration of recombinant Epo fails to stimulate melanoma growth in vivo, but the treatment increased vascular size in the xenografts. Increased local recurrence after excision of the primary tumors was observed after Epo treatment. Epo induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plug assays, and neutralization of Epo secreted by melanoma cells results in decreased angiogenesis. These data support that EpoR is functional in melanoma and EpoR activation may promote melanoma progression, and suggest that Epo may stimulate angiogenesis and increase survival of melanoma cells under hypoxic condition in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2116141728,"Disc1 is a schizophrenia risk gene that engages multiple signaling pathways during neurogenesis and brain development. Using the zebrafish as a tool, we analyze the function of zebrafish Disc1 (zDisc1) at the earliest stages of brain and body development. We define a ""tool"" as a biological system that gives insight into mechanisms underlying a human disorder, although the system does not phenocopy the disorder. A zDisc1 peptide binds to GSK3β, and zDisc1 directs early brain development and neurogenesis, by promoting β-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling and inhibiting GSK3β activity. zDisc1 loss-of-function embryos additionally display a convergence and extension phenotype, demonstrated by abnormal movement of dorsolateral cells during gastrulation, through changes in gene expression, and later through formation of abnormal, U-shaped muscle segments, and a truncated tail. These phenotypes are caused by alterations in the noncanonical Wnt pathway, via Daam and Rho signaling. The convergence and extension phenotype can be rescued by a dominant negative GSK3β construct, suggesting that zDisc1 inhibits GSK3β activity during noncanonical Wnt signaling. This is the first demonstration that Disc1 modulates the noncanonical Wnt pathway and suggests a previously unconsidered mechanism by which Disc1 may contribute to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1992473112,"Suppression of IL-2 βproduction from T cells is an important process for the immune regulation by TGF-β. However, the mechanism by which this suppression occurs remains to be established. Here, we demonstrate that Smad2 and Smad3, two major TGF-β-downstream transcription factors, are redundantly essential for TGF-β-mediated suppression of IL-2 production in CD4+ T cells using Smad2- and Smad3-deficient T cells. Both Smad2 and Smad3 were recruited into the proximal region of the IL-2 promoter in response to TGF-β. We then investigated the histone methylation status of the IL-2 promoter. Although both histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3K27 trimethylation have been implicated in gene silencing, only H3K9 trimethylation was increased in the proximal region of the IL-2 promoter in a Smad2/3-dependent manner, whereas H3K27 trimethylation was not. The H3K9 methyltransferases Setdb1 and Suv39h1 bound to Smad3 and suppressed IL-2 promoter activity in collaboration with Smad3. Overexpression of Suv39h1 in 68-41 T cells strongly inhibited IL-2 production in response to T cell receptor stimulation irrespective of the presence or absence of TGF-β, whereas Setdb1 overexpression only slightly suppressed IL-2 production. Silencing of Suv39h1 by shRNA reverted the suppressive effect of TGF-β on IL-2 production. Furthermore, TGF-β induced Suv39h1 recruitment to the proximal region of the IL-2 promoter in wild type primary T cells; however, this was not observed in Smad2−/−Smad3+/− T cells. Thus, we propose that Smads recruit H3K9 methyltransferases Suv39h1 to the IL-2 promoter, thereby inducing suppressive histone methylation and inhibiting T cell receptor-mediated IL-2 transcription.

The pleiotropic cytokine TGF-β plays several critical roles in suppressing the immune response (1Yoshimura A. Wakabayashi Y. Mori T. J.

Although multiple types of immune cells can be regulated by TGF-β, helper T cells actually play a central role in the immunosuppressive effect of TGF-β; this is deduced from the observation that the neonatal lethality of TGF-β1-deficient mice is eliminated by depletion of CD4+ T cells (6Rudner L.A. Lin J.T. Park I.K. Cates J.M. Dyer D.A. Franz D.M. French M.A. Duncan E.M. White H.D. Gorham J.D. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and that the crossing of TGF-β1-deficient mice onto a MHC class II null background prevents the inflammation that they would otherwise develop (7Letterio J.J. Geiser A.G. Kulkarni A.B. Dang H. Kong L. Nakabayashi T. Mackall C.L. Gress R.E. Roberts A.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2109-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One of the most important effects of TGF-β on T cells is the suppression of IL-2 production (8Brabletz T. Pfeuffer I. Schorr E. Siebelt F. Wirth T. Serfling E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which leads to the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β on activated T cells. Other important functions of TGF-β for T cells are the induction of Foxp3, a master regulator of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) 3The abbreviations used are: Treg cellsregulatory T cellsTCRT cell receptorHMThistone methyltransferaseSBESmad-binding elementCREBcAMP-responsive element-binding proteinCNSconserved non-coding sequenceNF-ATnuclear factor of activated T-cells. and the suppression of the production of effector cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-4. regulatory T cells T cell receptor histone methyltransferase Smad-binding element cAMP-responsive element-binding protein conserved non-coding sequence nuclear factor of activated T-cells. The major signaling pathways of the TGF-β receptors are relatively simple (9Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). TGF-β first binds to a TGF-β receptor, which then primarily activates Smad transcription factors, including three structurally similar proteins: two receptor-associated Smads known as Smad2 and Smad3 and one common Smad known as Smad4. Smad2 and Smad3 are directly phosphorylated and activated by TGF-β receptor; they also heterodimerize with Smad4. The activated Smad complex translocates into the nucleus and, in cooperation with other nuclear cofactors, regulates the transcription of target genes. Apparently, however, Smad-independent pathways also exist (10Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar, 11Yang X.O. Nurieva R. Martinez G.J. Kang H.S. Chung Y. Pappu B.P. Shah B. Chang S.H. Schluns K.S. Watowich S.S. Feng X.H. Jetten A.M. Dong C. Immunity. 2008; 29: 44-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The downstream mechanism for the regulation of T cells by TGF-β remains unclear. It has been reported that either Smad2 or Smad3 can regulate a distinctive set of genes in fibroblasts and tumor cells (9Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Smad2-knock-out (KO) mice are embryonic-lethal (12Nomura M. Li E. Nature. 1998; 393: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), and Smad3-KO mice exhibit inflammatory diseases (13Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Smad2 is involved in mediating signals during development, whereas Smad3 is important in suppressing inflammation. However, our experiments with T cell-specific Smad2 conditional knock-out mice have revealed that Smad2 and Smad3 unexpectedly share some overlapping functions in TGF-β-induced Foxp3 induction as well as in IFN-γ suppression (14Takimoto T. Wakabayashi Y. Sekiya T. Inoue N. Morita R. Ichiyama K. Takahashi R. Asakawa M. Muto G. Mori T. Hasegawa E. Saika S. Hara T. Nomura M. Yoshimura A. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 842-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Smad2/Smad3-double knock-out mice, but not single knock-out mice, develop fatal inflammatory diseases and exhibit elevated IFN-γ production and reduced Foxp3 expression in CD4+ T cells at the periphery (14Takimoto T. Wakabayashi Y. Sekiya T. Inoue N. Morita R. Ichiyama K. Takahashi R. Asakawa M. Muto G. Mori T. Hasegawa E. Saika S. Hara T. Nomura M. Yoshimura A. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 842-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). TGF-β-mediated induction of Foxp3 and suppression of IFN-γ were completely eliminated in Smad2/3-double KO T cells, but only partially impaired in Smad2 or Smad3 single KO T cells (14Takimoto T. Wakabayashi Y. Sekiya T. Inoue N. Morita R. Ichiyama K. Takahashi R. Asakawa M. Muto G. Mori T. Hasegawa E. Saika S. Hara T. Nomura M. Yoshimura A. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 842-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that Smad2 and Smad3 are redundantly essential for Foxp3 induction and IFN-γ suppression. However, the roles of Smad2/3 in IL-2 suppression by TGF-β remain to be completely elucidated. The signals involved in IL-2 suppression by TGF-β also remain to be elucidated. TGF-β suppresses IL-2 production in T cells potentially through direct inhibition of IL-2 promoter activity. A cis-acting enhancer DNA element has been identified as critical in suppressing IL-2 production via TGF-β (8Brabletz T. Pfeuffer I. Schorr E. Siebelt F. Wirth T. Serfling E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tob, a member of an anti-proliferative gene family, was shown to bind to Smad2, but not to Smad3, thereby inhibiting IL-2 production (16Tzachanis D. Freeman G.J. Hirano N. van Puijenbroek A.A. Delfs M.W. Berezovskaya A. Nadler L.M. Boussiotis V.A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Runx1/3 also play essential roles in cytokine production from CD4+ T cells and may be potential interaction partners of Smad2 and/or Smad3 (17Miyazono K. Maeda S. Imamura T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4232-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is notable that an essential Nuclear factor of activated T cells binding site is present in the Foxp3 promoter, adjacent to the Smad-binding elements (18Takaki H. Ichiyama K. Koga K. Chinen T.

Tykocinski M.L. Greene M.I. Tone M. Nat Immunol. 2008; 9: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which Smad2 and Smad3 enhance or suppress these transcription factor activities have not been identified. Recent studies have revealed epigenetic regulation of cytokines during helper T cell differentiation (20Wilson C.B. Rowell E. Sekimata M. Nat Rev Immunol. 2009; 9: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been revealed that gene silencing and suppression of transcription are often associated with certain histone modifications, namely, the di- and trimethylation of histone 3 (H3) lysine (K) 27 or H3K9 (21Ruthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Here, using Smad2- and Smad3-deficient T cells, we demonstrate for the first time that Smad2 and Smad3 are redundantly essential for TGF-β-mediated suppression of IL-2 production in CD4+ T cells. Smads suppressed IL-2 proximal promoter activity and promoted H3K9 trimethylation in the IL-2 proximal promoter region. We propose that Smads recruit H3K9 methyltransferases to the IL-2 promoter, thereby suppressing IL-2 transcription. T cell-specific Smad2 conditional knock-out (cKO) mice and Smad3−/− mice have been described previously (14Takimoto T. Wakabayashi Y. Sekiya T. Inoue N. Morita R. Ichiyama K. Takahashi R. Asakawa M. Muto G. Mori T. Hasegawa E. Saika S. Hara T. Nomura M. Yoshimura A. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 842-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). T cells from Smad2-cKO mice are henceforth described as Smad2−/− T cells. Mice were kept in specific pathogen-free facilities at Keio University. All experiments using mice were approved by and performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee of Keio University. CD4+CD25−CD44lowCD62Lhigh naïve T cells from spleens and lymph nodes were enriched through negative selection using the magnetic cell sorting system (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) with biotin-conjugated anti-CD8.2 (53–6.7), anti-B220/CD44 (RA3–6B2), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-TER119, and anti-NK1.1 (PK136) antibodies (all from eBioscience, San Diego, CA) as well as streptoavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were then FACS-sorted using a BD FACSAriaTM cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The purity of the sorted CD4+ T cell populations was consistently >98%. T cells were activated by anti-CD3e (145–2C11) and anti-CD28 (37.51) and cultured in the presence of recombinant hTGF-β1 (0.1–2 ng/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) to induce Foxp3 (22Ichiyama K. Yoshida H. Wakabayashi Y. Chinen T. Saeki K. Nakaya M. Takaesu G. Hori S. Yoshimura A. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17003-17008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). T cells were maintained in a complete medium containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 nm non-essential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells from the T cell line 68-41 were provided by Dr. Masato Kubo (Research Center for Allergy and Immunology, Yokohama, Japan) and cultured as described previously (22Ichiyama K. Yoshida H. Wakabayashi Y. Chinen T. Saeki K. Nakaya M. Takaesu G. Hori S. Yoshimura A. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17003-17008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). 68-41 cells were stimulated with anti-CD3ϵ antibody in the presence or absence of recombinant hTGF-β1 as described above. Anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and T7 antibody was from Novagen (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ). 293 cells transfected with indicated plasmids were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.3 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque, Tokyo, Japan). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Proteins from cell lysates were precipitated with 1 μg of an antibody and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C (23Koga K. Takaesu G. Yoshida R. Nakaya M. Kobayashi T. Kinjyo I. Yoshimura A. Immunity. 2009; 30: 372-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The immune complex was washed three times with washing buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 and was suspended in 40 μl of rinse buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. For Western blotting, the immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were resolved through SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blotted with the indicated antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG using Chemi-Lumi One L Western-blotting detection reagents (Nacalai Tesque) as described previously (24Chinen T. Komai K. Muto G. Morita R. Inoue N. Yoshida H. Sekiya T. Yoshida R. Nakamura K. Takayanagi R. Yoshimura A. Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 190Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For IL-2 intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stimulated for 6 h in complete medium with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml; both from Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of brefeldin A (eBioscience) (25Tanaka K.

Surface staining was then performed in the presence of Fc-blocking antibodies (2.4G2), followed by intracellular staining for anti-IL-2 antibody (1A12, eBioscience) with the Fixation and Permeabilization kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions (25Tanaka K.

The ChIP assay was performed as described previously (18Takaki H. Ichiyama K. Koga K. Chinen T. Takaesu G. Sugiyama Y. Kato S. Yoshimura A. Kobayashi T. J. Biol.

Smad2- and Smad3-specific monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (5339 for Smad2 and 9523 for Smad3). Anti-Suv39h1 and anti-trimethylated histone antibodies were from Abcam.plc (ab12405 for SUV39H1, ab6002 for H3K27me3, ab8898 for H3K9me3, and ab1012 for H3K4me3). Briefly, primary T cells or 69–41 T cells (∼7 × 106) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and then suspended in an SDS lysis buffer. After sonication consisting of 15 30-s pulses from a Bioruptor sonicator (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), samples were incubated with 2.5 μg of antibodies or control IgG overnight at 4 °C. After the addition of salmon sperm DNA and protein A-agarose slurry, the immunoprecipitates were sequentially washed once with a low salt buffer, once with a high salt buffer, once with an LiCl buffer, and twice with a TE buffer. The DNA-protein complex was eluted by heating at 65 °C for 6 h. Proteins were then digested with proteinase K, and RNA was removed by the addition of 10 μg of RNase A. DNA was recovered using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then subjected to real-time PCR analysis with attention to the IL-2 promoter regions. Real-time PCR was performed using the following primers: proximal (−0.4 to −0.3), 5′-TTCATCTATCTCCTCTTGCGTTTG-3′ and 5′-ATTTTCCTCTTTGGGGTGGAG-3′; IL-2 promoter (−1.6to −1.4, 5′- ACCCACAGTGTGCATGTAGC-3′ and 5′-AGCCTCACCACACACCTACC-3′; distal (−8.3 to −8.1), 5′-TGACAATGCTGGCTTCTGAC-3′ and 5′-CAAGCAAAACGATCCAAGAG-3′. cDNA sequences for Suv39h1 and Setdb1 were amplified by RT-PCR and subcloned into pCMVT7 vector for T7 tag and pCMV14 vector (Sigma-Aldrich) for FLAG tag (26Yoshida R.

Suv39h1 and Setdb1 cDNAs were also subcloned into pMX retroviral vector with internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-GFP. shRNA target sequences were selected based on the BLOCK-iTTM RNAi Designer (Invitrogen). The following oligonucleotides were amplified with the XhoI and EcoRI amplification primers and subcloned into the MSCV-LMP vector (Open Biosystems) as described (27Ichiyama K. Sekiya T. Inoue N.

Retrovirus vectors were transfected into HEK293 cells with helper virus plasmids (28Nonami A. Taketomi T. Kimura A. Saeki K. Takaki H. Sanada T. Taniguchi K. Harada M. Kato R. Yoshimura A. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using the FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) to obtain the viruses. Fresh retrovirus supernatant was added and the cells were spun at 2500 rpm for 2 h at 35 °C. After spin infection, the cells were cultured for an additional 2 days, and GFP-positive cells were then sorted with FACS (29Sekiya T. Kashiwagi I. Inoue N. Morita R. Hori S. Waldmann H. Rudensky A.Y. Ichinose H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Yoshimura A. Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 269Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). GFP-positive cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody and TGF-β for 24 h and harvested for real-time PCR analysis. Both the process of transfection into HEK293T cells and the luciferase assay have been described previously (22Ichiyama K. Yoshida H. Wakabayashi Y. Chinen T. Saeki K. Nakaya M. Takaesu G. Hori S. Yoshimura A. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17003-17008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Briefly, 68-41 cells were seeded on 12-well plates (7 × 104cells/well) and transfected with various amounts of expression vector using FuGENE HD reagent. After transfection, HEK293T cells were cultured for 18 h and then restimulated with or without PMA for 10 h. All cells were harvested using 50 μl of lysis buffer. The luciferase assay was performed using a luciferase substrate kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activity was read with a Packard luminometer and normalized to an internal control, namely, β-galactosidase. The Student's paired two-tailed t test was used. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. All error bars shown in this article represent S.D. First, we compared the time course of IL-2 and Foxp3 induction in primary T cells in the presence or absence of TGF-β (Fig. 1A). TGF-β suppressed IL-2 mRNA induced by TCR stimulation and up-regulated Foxp3 mRNA in cooperation with TCR stimulation. The effect of TGF-β was clearly observed for both genes from 8 to 24 h (Fig. 1A), suggesting that not only Foxp3 but also IL-2 was directly regulated by the TGF-β signaling. We then compared mRNA gene profiles regulated by TGF-β in a microarray analysis, using WT, Smad2−/−, Smad3−/−, and Smad2−/−Smad3+/− T cells at 24 h stimulation (14Takimoto T. Wakabayashi Y. Sekiya T. Inoue N. Morita R. Ichiyama K. Takahashi R. Asakawa M. Muto G. Mori T. Hasegawa E. Saika S. Hara T. Nomura M. Yoshimura A. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 842-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Among the various Smad2/3-redundant genes, Foxp3 was clearly up-regulated by TGF-β in a Smad2- and Smad3-dependent manner (14Takimoto T. Wakabayashi Y. Sekiya T. Inoue N. Morita R. Ichiyama K. Takahashi R. Asakawa M. Muto G. Mori T. Hasegawa E. Saika S. Hara T. Nomura M. Yoshimura A. J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 842-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Foxp3 induction was severely impaired in Smad2−/−Smad3+/− T cells, though only partially reduced in Smad2 or Smad3 single KO T cells (Fig. 1B). Among the Smad2/3-dependently suppressed genes, IL-2 was the most severely reduced by TGF-β clearly showed Smad2/3 dependence (Fig. 1B). To confirm the Smad2/3-dependent suppression of IL-2 production, we compared IL-2 protein levels by intracellular cytokine staining and FACS analysis. After T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation with anti-CD3e antibody, primary T cells produced large amounts of IL-2, but this process was strongly suppressed by the presence of a relatively small amount of TGF-β (Fig. 1C, WT). In Smad2−/− T cells, this suppression of IL-2 production was not observed in the presence of 0.1 ng/ml TGF-β, but slight suppression was observed in the presence of 0.5 ng/ml TGF-β. TGF-β also suppressed IL-2 production less efficiently in Smad3−/− T cells than in WT T cells (Fig. 1C). In Smad2−/−Smad3−/+ T cells, however, the fraction of IL-2-positive cells was not reduced even in the presence of 0.5 ng/ml TGF-β, in a finding consistent with microarray data. These data clearly demonstrate that TCR-mediated IL-2 production is suppressed by TGF-β through Smad2/3-dependent mechanisms. Smad2 and Smad3 seemed to function redundantly and additively for IL-2 suppression. Then, we investigated the mechanism of Smad2/3-mediated IL-2 promoter suppression. It has been shown that the proximal region of the IL-2 promoter contains Smad-responsive elements to which Smad2/Smad4 binds, but Smad3 does not (16Tzachanis D. Freeman G.J. Hirano N. van Puijenbroek A.A. Delfs M.W. Berezovskaya A. Nadler L.M. Boussiotis V.A. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, this previously reported Smad-binding element was not present in the mouse IL-2 promoter. Moreover, our data indicate that both Smad2 and Smad3 are involved in IL-2 suppression. Therefore, other Smad2/3-dependent mechanisms must be involved in the IL-2 promoter suppression by TGF-β. To confirm the recruitment of both Smad2 and Smad3 to the IL-2 promoter, we performed a ChIP assay using Smad2 and Smad3-specific monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A, both Smad2 and Smad3 bound to the proximal region but not to the distal region of the IL-2 promoter. The level of Smad3 recruitment to the IL-2 promoter was much higher than that of Smad2, which may reflect higher DNA-binding ability of Smad3 than that of Smad2 (9Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). To determine the part of the proximal region to which Smad3 was bound, we performed a luciferase-reporter assay. The proximal region of the promoter was fused to luciferase, then transfected with NF-AT and Smad3 cDNA into 293 cells and stimulated with PMA (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of Smad3 inhibited NF-AT- mediated activation of the −577 and −194 IL-2 promoters. The suppression activity of Smad3 was reduced in the −145 promoter, however, suggesting that Smad-responsive elements exist between −194 and −145. As shown in Fig. 2C, this region contains several NF-AT and AP-1 binding sites and four potential Smad3/Smad4 binding sequences, termed CAGA boxes (30Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). We mutated these CAGA boxes, but none of them affected Smad3-mediated suppression of IL-2 promoter activity (Fig. 2D). This raised the possibility that the direct binding of Smads may not be necessary for the suppression of the IL-2 promoter. This possibility was supported by the data showing that Smad2, which lacks a functional DNA-binding domain (9Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar), still suppressed IL-2 promoter activity like Smad3 (Fig. 3A). To abolish DNA binding ability of Smad3, we mutated several amino acid residues, including Arg-74 and Gln-76, which are necessary for DNA binding in Smad3 (31Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). As reported, these mutants lost the enhancing activity of the reporter containing the Smad-binding elements (SBEs) (Fig. 3B, left; data for Q76A are not shown). Nevertheless, these Smad3 mutants still suppressed NF-AT-mediated IL-2 promoter activity as efficiently as WT Smad3 did (Fig. 3B, right). Taken together, our results suggest that Smad2 and Smad3 suppress IL-2 promoter activity without binding directly to the DNA. Given that our ChIP assay revealed the recruitment of Smad3 to the proximal region of the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 2A), it is likely that Smad2/3 may bind to the DNA indirectly, through association with other transcription factors. The recognition that specific post-translational modifications of histones are associated with the activation and silencing of specific genes has given rise to the histone code hypothesis (21Ruthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Specifically, the promotion and enhancement of active or recently transcribed genes are associated with histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) mono-, di-, and trimethylation, whereas silenced genes possess di- and trimethylated H3K27 or di- and trimethylated H3K9. Methylated H3K27 is typically found throughout the condensed, facultative heterochromatin of silenced tissue-specific loci, whereas methylated H3K9 is found throughout constitutive heterochromatin or in discrete sites within active genes, where they may inhibit inappropriate transcription (21Ruthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a ChIP assay to compare the methylation status of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 in the proximal regions of the IL-2 promoter of primary naïve T cells in response to TCR stimulation in the presence or absence of TGF-β (Fig. 4A). H3K4 trimethylation in the proximal region of the IL-2 promoter did not occur in response to TCR stimulation irrespective of TGF-β, and H3K27 trimethylation was rather suppressed by TGF-β. H3K9 trimethylation, on the other hand, was strongly enhanced by TGF-β. This enhancement was partly impaired in Smad2-deficient T cells and almost completely abrogated in Smad3-deficient T cells; these findings are consistent with the possibility of Smad2/3-dependent suppression of IL-2 transcription. In addition, TGF-β-mediated H3K9 trimethylation occurred only in the proximal region but not in dis"

Two putative glycosyltransferases, Gtf1 and Gtf2, from Streptococcus parasanguinis form a two-protein enzyme complex that is required for glycosylation of a serine-rich repeat adhesin, Fap1. Gtf1 is a glycosyltransferase; however, the function of Gtf2 is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Gtf2 enhances the enzymatic activity of Gtf1 by its chaperone-like property. Gtf2 interacted with Gtf1, mediated the subcellular localization of Gtf1, and stabilized Gtf1. Deletion of invariable amino acid residues in a conserved domain of unknown function (DUF1975) at the N terminus of Gtf2 had a greater impact on Fap1 glycosylation than deletion of the C-terminal non-DUF1975 residues. The DUF1975 deletions concurrently reduced the interaction between Gtf1 and Gtf2, altered the subcellular localization of Gtf1, and destabilized Gtf1, suggesting that DUF1975 is crucial for the chaperone activity of Gtf2. Homologous GtfA and GtfB from Streptococcus agalactiae rescued the glycosylation defect in the gtf1gtf2 mutant; like Gtf2, GtfB also possesses chaperone-like activity.

Protein glycosylation is fundamental to bacterial fitness and virulence. A growing number of bacterial proteins have been identified as glycoproteins that are modified by either N- or O-linked glycosylation.

A gene cluster flanking the SRRP gene has been implicated in glycosylation of SRRPs. This gene cluster consists of two regions: a core region and a variable region. The core region contains genes that are highly conserved in every SRRP locus. It encodes two essential glycosyltransferases and several accessory secretory components, SecA2, SecY2, and Gap1–Gap3 or their homologs (7Zhou M. Wu H. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The variable region is diverse and species-dependent. The glycosyltransferases from the core region are essential for glycosylation of SRRPs. For instance, GtfA and GtfB are required for glycosylation of GspB and Srr-1 from S. gordonii and S. agalactiae, respectively (14Takamatsu D. Bensing B.A. Sullam P.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7100-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Mistou M.Y. Dramsi S. Brega S. Poyart C. Trieu-Cuot P. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 4195-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Gtf1 and Gtf2 from S. parasanguinis form an enzyme complex and catalyze the transfer of the first sugar residue, GlcNAc, to the polypeptide backbone of Fap1. They are required for glycosylation of Fap1 in vivo (21Bu S. Li Y. Zhou M. Azadin P. Zeng M. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Zhou M. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2008; 72: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Wu R. Zhou M. Wu H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Gtf1 and Gtf2 homologs from S. pneumoniae exhibit the same activity in vitro and in vivo (23Wu R. Zhou M. Wu H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The necessity of using two putative glycosyltransferases to add a single sugar is also observed in O-mannosylation in eukaryotic cells (24Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2009Google Scholar); however, the mechanism underlying the functional association remains unclear. Gtf1 and its homologs share significant similarity with the GT-B family of glycosyltransferases. Indeed, Gtf1 alone can catalyze the transfer of GlcNAc to Fap1 in vitro (23Wu R. Zhou M. Wu H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gtf2 and its homologs do not share any sequence similarity with any known glycosyltransferases. Consistent with this observation, Gtf2 does not exhibit any glycosyltransferase activity by itself; however, it is capable of enhancing the glycosyltransferase activity of Gtf1 when it forms a heterodimeric enzyme complex with Gtf1 (23Wu R. Zhou M. Wu H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo glycosylation of native SRRPs occurs when the Gtf2 homolog is coexpressed with the Gtf1 homolog (14Takamatsu D. Bensing B.A. Sullam P.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7100-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Mistou M.Y. Dramsi S. Brega S. Poyart C. Trieu-Cuot P. J.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gtf2 homologs play an important role in mediating glycosylation of SRRPs. However, how Gtf2 and its homologs contribute to the glycosylation process remains unknown. In this study, we determined that Gtf2 and its homologs exhibit a chaperone activity to mediate glycosylation of SRRPs. Furthermore, we found that a domain of unknown function (DUF1975) is crucial for the chaperone activity. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) F51 only reacts with mature Fap1, and mAb E42 is specific for the Fap1 polypeptide backbone (25Stephenson A.E. Wu H. Novak J. Tomana M. Mintz K. Fives-Taylor P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated succinyl wheat germ agglutinin was used to detect GlcNAc-modified Fap1 variants. The Srr-2-specific antibody was prepared from rabbit sera immunized with whole cell S. agalactiae J48 (16Seifert K.N. Adderson E.E. Whiting A.A. Bohnsack J.F. Crowley P.J. Brady L.J. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Based on the highly conserved sequence regions among Gtf2 homologs, nine small amino acid motifs were selected for site-directed mutagenesis. In brief, a plasmid carrying the wild-type gtf2 allele (pGEX6p1-gtf1-gtf2) was used as a template. Only four conserved amino acid residues in each selected region were deleted; the deletions were constructed using the QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described (26Li Y. Chen Y. Huang X. Zhou M. Wu R. Dong S. Pritchard D.G. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1094-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with the primers listed in supplemental Table 2. Plasmids pAL200, pAL202, and nine site-directed pGEX6p1-gtf1-gtf2 mutants were individually cotransformed with plasmid pAL80 carrying mini-Fap1 (Fap1ΔRII) into Escherichia coli. The resultant recombinant bacterial cells were harvested at the exponential growth phase, lysed with loading buffer, and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed to determine Fap1 production as described (27Wu H. Bu S. Newell P. Chen Q. Fives-Taylor P. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified with glutathione-agarose beads and analyzed as described previously (21Bu S. Li Y. Zhou M. Azadin P. Zeng M. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein stability was assessed following a well established protocol (28Peng Z. Wu H. Ruiz T. Chen Q. Zhou M. Sun B. Fives-Taylor P. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 2008; 23: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In brief, bacteria were grown to A600 = 0.5 for E. coli or A470 = 0.5 for S. parasanguinis. To block nascent protein synthesis, tetracycline (30 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (300 or 2 μg/ml) was added to E. coli, S. parasanguinis, and S. agalactiae cultures, respectively. 0.5 ml of the cell culture was then collected from each strain at different time points to determine the amounts of targeted proteins. Harvested cell pellets from S. parasanguinis and S. agalactiae were lysed, and cell lysates were then subjected to Western blot analysis. The in vitro sensitivity of Gtf1 to trypsin was assessed by mixing Gtf1 with different amounts of Gtf2. 4 μg of Gtf1 was mixed with 4 μg, 0.4 μg, 4 ng, 0.04 ng, and 0 ng of Gtf2. 0.8 μg/ml trypsin was added to the mixture and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Gtf1 that remained after proteolytic digestion was evaluated by subjecting the treated samples to SDS-PAGE. Exponentially grown S. parasanguinis cells were harvested and digested with mutanolysin (Sigma) to release cell wall-associated proteins. Culture supernatants, cell lysates, and cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (27Wu H. Bu S. Newell P. Chen Q. Fives-Taylor P. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29McNab R. Jenkinson H. Methods Cell Sci. 1998; 20: 209-216Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Proteolysis was carried out as described previously (30Joliot A. Maizel A. Rosenberg D. Trembleau A. Dupas S. Volovitch M. Prochiantz A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 856-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Bacterial subcellular fractions prepared from 5 ml of bacterial cultures were digested with 4 μg/ml trypsin in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 20 min. Gtf1 resistant to proteolytic digestion was analyzed by Western blotting of the treated samples with anti-Gtf1 mAb. The nine different site-directed gtf2 mutant fragments were PCR-amplified from the pGEX6p1-gtf1-gtf2 derivatives. The mutant fragments were digested and then ligated into the shuttle plasmid pVPT-TAP. The correct pVPT-TAP-gtf2 plasmid variants were transformed into the gtf2 mutant to generate the desired gtf2 variants. The gtfA, gtfB, and gtfAgtfB fragments were cloned from S. agalactiae J48 genomic DNA and inserted into pVPT-TAP. The correct constructs were transformed into a gtf2 single mutant or a gtf1gtf2 double mutant. A non-polar gtfB mutant fragment was generated as described previously (21Bu S. Li Y. Zhou M. Azadin P. Zeng M. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by inserting a kanamycin-resistant cassette (aphA3). Briefly, the primer pairs listed in supplemental Table 2 were used in an inverse PCR to delete the selected region from gtfB. The inverse PCR fragment was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated with the kanamycin cassette. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli to obtain transformants containing a correct gtfB mutant plasmid. The kanamycin-inserted gtfB fragment was then released from the plasmid and inserted into the thermosensitive vector pJL1055 (31Li J. Kasper D.L. Ausubel F.M. Rosner B. Michel J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13251-13256Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transformation of S. agalactiae by the thermosensitive plasmid was carried out as described (31Li J. Kasper D.L. Ausubel F.M. Rosner B. Michel J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13251-13256Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), followed by overnight selection on Todd-Hewitt broth plates with 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C. The overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold into fresh Todd-Hewitt broth, grown for 2 h at 30 °C, shifted to 37 °C, and incubated for an additional 3 h to cure the plasmid. Bacterial cultures were then streaked onto Todd-Hewitt broth plates with 1.5 mg/ml kanamycin to select double crossover integration transformants. The correct gtfB mutant AL64 was resistant to kanamycin, sensitive to chloramphenicol, and confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. The gtfB mutant was complemented by transforming AL64 with pVPT-TAP-gtfB. Biofilm formation of S. parasanguinis and its mutants was carried out in a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate as described (32Froeliger E.H. Fives-Taylor P. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2512-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mini-Fap1, GST-Fap1ΔRII bound to glutathione beads, 2.7 μg of purified Gtf proteins, and activated nucleotide sugar at 100 nm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added in a glycosyltransferase assay buffer (50 mm Hepes and 0.01% BSA, pH 7.0) and incubated at 37 °C. The glycosyltransferase activity was determined by measuring the radioactivity transferred to the mini-Fap1 protein as described (33Zhou M. Zhu F. Dong S. Pritchard D.G. Wu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12140-12148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that Gtf1 and Gtf2 form an enzyme complex in vivo and in vitro (23Wu R. Zhou M. Wu H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). No other accessory proteins are found in the complex. Gtf1 is a typical glycosyltransferase that belongs to the GT-B family of glycosyltransferases. However, Gtf2 does not have any structural feature resembling a glycosyltransferase. In an in vitro glycosylation assay, Gtf1 retained only 25% of the enzymatic activity of the Gtf1-Gtf2 complex, whereas Gtf2 alone did not possess any enzymatic activity (23Wu R. Zhou M. Wu H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that Gtf2 can enhance Gtf1 enzymatic activity. To characterize this further, we determined the kinetics (Km and Kcat) of Gtf1 and calculated Kcat/Km, a ratio used to measure the efficiency and specificity of an enzyme. The Kcat/Km of the Gtf1-Gtf2 complex is 22-fold greater than that of Gtf1 alone (Table 1), demonstrating that Gtf1 is a more potent and specific enzyme when Gtf2 is coexpressed.TABLE 1Comparison of kinetic parameters of the Gtf1-Gtf2 complex and Gtf1EnzymeKmKcatKcat/Kmμmmin−1min−1·μm−1Gtf127.2 ± 311.7 ± 0.30.43Gtf1-Gtf241.3 ± 6382 ± 199.3 Open table in a new tab Coexpression of this conserved glycosyltransferase pair (Gtf1 and Gtf2) or their homologs is essential for glycosylation of SRRPs in vivo (21Bu S.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they interact with each other (23Wu R. Zhou M. Wu H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of a conserved enzyme complex for glycosylation of SRRPs. As Gtf2 interacts with Gtf1 and enhances its enzymatic activity, we hypothesized that Gtf2 might possess chaperone-like activity. Many molecular chaperones stabilize their binding partners (34Zurawski D.V. Stein M.A. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2055-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Spaeth K.E. Chen Y.S.

Microbiol. 1995; 16: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To examine whether Gtf2 exhibits such an activity, we determined the effect of Gtf2 on Gtf1 stability. In the absence of Gtf2, Gtf1 was degraded rapidly compared with Gtf1 from wild-type S. parasanguinis (Fig. 1), suggesting that Gtf2 protects Gtf1 from degradation. This result is consistent with the notion that Gtf2 is a molecular chaperone for Gtf1. Gtf2 interacts with Gtf1, affects Gtf1 enzymatic activity, and modulates Gtf1 stability. One way that Gtf2 can exert its effect is through its ability to alter the subcellular localization of Gtf1; therefore, we examined the subcellular localization of Gtf1. Gtf1 is predicted to be a cytoplasmic protein, as it does not have apparent transmembrane motifs. Interestingly, Gtf1 was found in both the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). However, Gtf1 was not detected in the membrane fraction of the gtf2 mutant (Fig. 2A, lane 6) and accumulated mostly in the cytoplasmic fraction (lane 5). Importantly, complementation of the gtf2 mutant restored the subcellular distribution (Fig. 2A, lane 9). To exclude the possibility of nonspecific effects on subcellular localization by the gtf2 defect, we analyzed two additional mutants, gap1 and secY2, as both Gap1 and SecY2 are also required for Fap1 biogenesis (27Wu H. Bu S. Newell P. Chen Q. Fives-Taylor P. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 37Zhou M. Peng Z. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 5624-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These two mutants did not alter the subcellular localization of Gtf1 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Gtf2 specifically modulates the subcellular localization of Gtf1. It is worth noting that Gtf1 localized to the membrane fraction migrated slower than Gtf1 from other subcellular fractions (Fig. 2, A and B). We hypothesized that the distribution of Gtf1 to the membrane fraction may contribute to its stability. To test this hypothesis, we determined the susceptibility of Gtf1 from cytoplasmic and membrane fractions to the extracellular protease trypsin. Gtf1 from the membrane fraction was resistant to trypsin digestion, whereas Gtf1 from the cytoplasmic fraction was sensitive (Fig. 2C). It is well known that proteins localized to the membrane are usually not accessible to proteasome degradation in eukaryotes (30Joliot A. Maizel A. Rosenberg D. Trembleau A. Dupas S. Volovitch M. Prochiantz A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 856-863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 38Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the search for functional domains, we identified a conserved DUF1975 domain in the N terminus of Gtf2 (supplemental Fig. 1A). Members of the DUF1975 family are found predominantly in the N-terminal region of various bacterial glucosyltransferases (supplemental Fig. 1B). Five mutants in the DUF1975 domain and four mutants in the non-DUF1975 domains were constructed (supplemental Fig. 1B) and characterized to dissect their functional contribution to Gtf2. We first determined the ability of the Gtf complex to glycosylate mini-Fap1 using a recombinant glycosylation system established previously in E. coli (21Bu S. Li Y. Zhou M. Azadin P. Zeng M. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The resulting mini-Fap1 derivatives migrated faster than mini-Fap1 in the presence of the wild-type gtf2 allele (Fig. 3A, upper panel), suggesting that the gtf2 deletion mutants had reduced glycosylation. Furthermore, succinyl wheat germ agglutinin blotting revealed a complete loss or diminished glycosylation of the mini-Fap1 derivatives from the gtf2 mutants (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Interestingly, the five DUF1975 mutants exhibited more severe glycosylation defects than the non-DUF1975 mutants. Mutations in DUF1975 almost completely abolished Fap1 glycosylation, suggesting that DUF1975 is crucial for Fap1 glycosylation. To examine whether the severe defects exhibited by the DUF1975 mutants result from the instability of the Gtf1 and Gtf2 derivatives, we examined recombinant Gtf1 and Gtf2 proteins. Production of GST-Gtf1 fusion protein was not affected by the gtf2 mutations (Fig. 3B, lower panel). However, the amount of Gtf2 produced was differentially affected. Compared with the wild-type Gtf2 protein, only three mutants (Δ57–60, Δ61–64, and Δ315–318) maintained the wild-type production level (Fig. 3B, upper panel). The three mutants were used to determine the interaction between Gtf1 and Gtf2 using an in vitro GST pulldown assay (21Bu S. Li Y. Zhou M. Azadin P. Zeng M. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The ratio of the pulldown band intensity for Gtf2, Δ57–60, Δ61–64, and Δ315–318 is 27:7:4:25, demonstrating that the DUF1975 mutants exhibited the reduced interaction, whereas a non-DUF1975 mutant maintained the wild-type level of the interaction (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that DUF1975 mediates the interaction between Gtf1 and Gtf2. The in vitro glycosyltransferase activity of the Gtf2 variants was also assayed to further determine the functional contribution of DUF1975. DUF1975 mutants Δ57–60 and Δ61–64 exhibited much lower enzymatic activity than non-DUF1975 mutant Δ315–318 (Fig. 3D), albeit the amount of the input Gtf1 protein was comparable. These data suggest that the DUF1975-mediated interaction is important for the enzymatic activity of the Gtf1-Gtf2 complex. The effect of different Gtf2 DUF1975 variants on the stability of Gtf1 was assessed to determine the contribution of DUF1975. With wild-type Gtf2, Gtf1 and mini-Fap1 were stable for 1 h after treatment with tetracycline. DUF1975 mutants Δ57–60 (Fig. 4) and Δ61–64 (data not shown) expressed detectable amounts of Gtf2 proteins; however, Gtf1 was degraded 15 min post-treatment. Furthermore, mini-Fap1 migrated faster and became less stable. Non-DUF1975 mutants Δ315–318 (Fig. 4) and Δ353–356 (data not shown) produced low amounts of Gtf2. Remarkably, the amount of Gtf1 and mini-Fap1 produced was steady over the treatment course (Fig. 4), suggesting that Gtf1 stability is mediated by the DUF1975 domain and that a minimal amount of Gtf2 is sufficient to support the Gtf1 function. As Gtf1 and Gtf2 bind to each other at a 1:1 ratio (23Wu R. Zhou M. Wu H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we examined whether a reduced amount of Gtf2 would still support Gtf1 stability. Hence, the extracellular protease trypsin was chosen to assess Gtf1 stability (38Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one-thousandth of Gtf2 (4 ng of Gtf2 versus 4 μg of Gtf1) still supported Gtf1 resistance to protease digestion (Fig. 5), demonstrating that a minimal amount of Gtf2 is sufficient for Gtf1 stability and function. As DUF1975 from Gtf2 plays an important role in Gtf1-Gtf2 complex formation and enzymatic activity and as Gtf2 regulated the subcellular distribution of Gtf1, we examined the impact of DUF1975 on the subcellular localization of Gtf1 in S. parasanguinis. The DUF1975 mutants that had effects on Gtf1-Gtf2 interaction also altered the membrane distribution of Gtf1 (Fig. 6, A, lanes 6, 9, 12, and 15, and B, lane 3). By contrast, the non-DUF1975 mutants did not alter the subcellular distribution of Gtf1 (Fig. 6B, lane 6). Because Gtf2 and DUF1975 mutants altered the subcellular localization of Gtf1 and were not stable, we hypothesized that the non-membrane localization may render Gtf1 more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. To examine this, trypsin was used to assess Gtf1 stability in both cell lysate and membrane fractions. Upon trypsin treatment, less Gtf1 remained in cell lysates prepared from the Gtf2 mutant and Δ57–60 compared with the wild type and Δ315–318 (Fig. 6C). The remaining Gtf1 could still be associated with the membrane, which is resistant to trypsin digestion. Indeed, Gtf1 was resistant to trypsin in both the Δ57–60 and Δ315–318 membrane fractions (Fig. 6D). In the presence of both Triton X-100 and trypsin, all or most of Gtf1 was degraded in either the membrane or cell lysate fractions, as Triton X-100 can release membrane-associated proteins, supporting the notion that membrane-associated Gtf1 is protected from proteolytic degradation. These data are in agreement with the observations that Gtf1 from low Gtf2-producing non-DUF1975 mutants is localized to the membrane fraction, resistant to proteolytic digestion, and more stable, demonstrating the importance of DUF1975. DUF1975 also exists at the N terminus in Gtf1, which mediates Gtf1-Gtf2 interactions (21Bu S. Li Y. Zhou M. Azadin P. Zeng M. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), thereby directing Fap1 glycosylation. A similar DUF1975 domain from accessory secretory proteins Gap1 and Asp1 has been implicated in the biogenesis of SRRPs (26Li Y. Chen Y. Huang X. Zhou M. Wu R. Dong S. Pritchard D.G. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1094-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Seepersaud R. Bensing B.A. Yen Y.T. Sullam P.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 490-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, its mode of action is not clear. Our findings indicate that localization of the glycosyltransferase enzyme complex to the membrane is required for optimal enzymatic activity. Such a phenomenon has been documented in many other eukaryotic glycosylation systems (40Mohammadi T. Karczmarek A. Crouvoisier M. Bouhss A. Mengin-Lecreulx D. den Blaauwen T. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1106-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 41Kos V. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Given that the Fap1 precursor is abundant in the membrane fraction (27Wu H. Bu S. Newell P. Chen Q. Fives-Taylor P. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1390-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 46Chen Q. Sun B. Wu H. Peng Z. Fives-Taylor P.M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7610-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), association of the glycosyltransferase complex with the membrane would facilitate glycosylation of Fap1. As many glycosyltransferases contain DUF1975 and lack apparent transmembrane domains, it is tempting to assume that the DUF1975 domain plays a critical role in Gtf1 function. Thus, we propose the following working model to illustrate how Gtf2 regulates Gtf1 enzymatic activity. DUF1975 within Gtf2 mediates the interaction between Gtf1 and Gtf2, which targets Gtf1 to the membrane and which, in turn, maintains the stability of the complex, thereby optimizing its enzymatic activity and promoting Fap1 glycosylation. Gtf1 and Gtf2 homologs are highly conserved in streptococci and staphylococci that produce SRRPs. The GtfA and GtfB proteins from GBS were used to determine whether they can substitute for Gtf1 and Gtf2. GtfA and GtfB were co-purified (Fig. 7A), suggesting that they interact with each other. The recombinant GtfA and GtfB proteins were then used in in vitro glycosyltransferase assays in which mini-Fap1 was used as a substrate. Like the Gtf1-Gtf2 complex, the GtfA-GtfB complex exhibited significant enzymatic activity in transferring UDP-GlcNAc to the Fap1 substrate (Fig. 7B). GtfA alone possessed only 20% of the activity, and GtfB itself had no detectable activity (Fig. 7B), suggesting that the formation of the GtfA-GtfB complex is also required for its optimal enzymatic activity. To confirm further the functional conservation of GtfA and GtfB, the gtf2 and gtf1gtf2 mutants were complemented using GtfA and GtfB. Coexpression of GtfA and GtfB supported production of mature Fap1 in both the single and double mutants (Fig. 8A, lanes 5 and 7). Interestingly, Fap1 detected in the gtf2 mutant complemented by gtfB migrated at a higher molecular mass position, although it reacted with mature Fap1-specific mAb F51 (Fig. 8, A and B, lane 4). Furthermore, we assayed biofilm formation by the complemented strains. Compared with wild-type S. parasanguinis, the GtfB complementation only partially restored the biofilm defect in the gtf2 mutant (Fig. 8C). However, complementation by GtfA and GtfB completely restored the biofilm formation of the gtf2 single and gtf1gtf2 double mutants (Fig. 8C), indicating that only the GtfA-GtfB complex can substitute for the native Gtf1-Gtf2 complex. Purification of GtfA and GtfB fusion proteins demonstrated that GtfA and GtfB form a heterodimeric enzyme complex (Fig. 7A). GtfB could be co-purified with GtfA-TAP from GBS using a tandem affinity purification strategy (data not shown), suggesting that a conserved GtfA-GtfB complex exists in GBS as well. A gtfB mutant in GBS was generated to determine the function of GtfB. The gtfB mutant failed to produce Srr-2 (Fig. 9A), suggesting that GtfB is required for the biogenesis of Srr-2. To explore how GtfB contributes to Srr-2 biogenesis, we examined whether GtfB stabilizes GtfA and prevents GtfA from degradation by transforming TAP-tagged GtfA in both wild-type GBS and the gtfB mutant. GtfA-TAP in wild-type GBS was more stable than that in the gtfB mutant (Fig. 9B). These data support the notion that GtfB possesses chaperone-like activity. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Gtf2 homologs are highly conserved in a variety of streptococci, staphylococci, and lactobacilli (7Zhou M. Wu H. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Gtf2 and its homologs have been shown to be involved in the transfer of the GlcNAc sugar residue to a number of SRRPs (14Takamatsu D. Bensing B.A. Sullam P.M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7100-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Bu S. Li Y. Zhou M. Azadin P. Zeng M. Fives-Taylor P. Wu H. J.

Microbiol. 2004; 53: 843-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), likely via chaperone-like activity, highlighting the functional conservation of the Gtf complex (23Wu R. Zhou M. Wu H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 7966-7971Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The molecular chaperone activity of Gtf2 explains the necessity for the formation of the Gtf complex in vitro and in vivo. The requirement of the molecular chaperone to activate glycosyltransferase in vivo is not unprecedented. T-synthase, required for glycosylation of the mature T antigen, a key step in mucin-type O-glycosylation, depends on a molecular chaperone called Cosmc (48Ju T. Cummings R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16613-16618Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Cosmc interacts with T-synthase, preventing protease-mediated degradation of the T-synthase (38Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this regard, Gtf2 is a Cosmc-like chaperone, although Gtf2 does not share any sequence homology with Cosmc. In summary, we have demonstrated the requirement of a chaperone-like activity of Gtf2 for glycosylation of SRRPs. The chaperone nature of Gtf2 appears to be common among Gtf2 homologs from streptococci and staphylococci. As the chaperone-like activity is a new property for Gtf2 homologs and may mediate bacterial virulence, understanding the molecular details would help in developing potential novel therapeutics.

Despite the critical function of RAS signaling, the activation kinetics have not been analyzed experimentally in living cells for any of the RAS effectors. Here, we analyzed the kinetics of RAF activation on the plasma membrane in living HeLa cells after stimulation with EGF to activate RAS. RAF is recruited by the active form of RAS (RAS-GTP) from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane through two RAS-binding sites (the RAS-binding domain and the cysteine-rich domain (CRD)) and is activated by its phosphorylation by still undetermined kinases on the plasma membrane. Using single-molecule imaging, we measured the dissociation time courses of GFP-tagged molecules of wild type RAF and fragments or mutants of RAF containing one or two of the three functional domains (the RAS-binding domain, the CRD, and the catalytic domain) to determine their interaction with membrane components. Each molecule showed a unique dissociation time course, indicating that both its interaction with RAS-GTP and its phosphorylation by the kinases are rate-limiting steps in RAF activation. Based on our experimental results, we propose a kinetic model for the activation of RAF. The model suggests the importance of the interaction between RAS-GTP and CRD for the effective activation of RAF, which is triggered by rapid RAS-GTP-induced conformational changes in RAF and the subsequent presentation of RAF to the kinase.

The RAS family of small GTPases is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis (1Avruch J. Zhang X.F. Kyriakis J.M.

Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In the inactive state, RAS binds GDP (RAS-GDP), and after the cells are stimulated, the bound GDP on RAS is exchanged for GTP to convert RAS into its active form (RAS-GTP) (7Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). The effectors are thought to recognize the conformational changes in RAS induced by this GDP/GTP exchange and to interact with RAS-GTP with higher affinity than with RAS-GDP (8Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brünger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). RAS does not chemically modify the effectors but regulates the activity of the effectors by recruiting them to the activators localized near RAS-GTP. Therefore, to understand how RAS regulates cellular processes through its effectors, it is essential to analyze precisely the recognition processes among RAS, its effector, and activator of the effector. However, the kinetics of the molecular interactions in the ternary complex containing RAS-GTP, its effector, and an activator have not yet been precisely determined in any situation, as far as we know. c-RAF (RAF), a serine/threonine kinase in the cytoplasm (1Avruch J. Zhang X.F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), is one of the most intensively studied effector molecules of H-RAS (RAS), a ubiquitous subtype of RAS (9Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). The stimulation of cells by growth factors, such as EGF, induces the production of RAS-GTP at the plasma membrane. RAF is then translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (10Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 11Stokoe D.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Many phosphorylation sites on RAF have been reported, which are involved either in its activation or in its inactivation (13Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 14Avruch J. Khokhlatchev A. Kyriakis J.M. Luo Z. Tzivion G. Vavvas D. Zhang X.F. Recent Prog. Horm.

Several serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation events that occur within several minutes of the initiation of RAS activation are thought to be essential for RAF activation when the cells are stimulated by growth factors (see Fig. 1A). However, the species of kinases responsible for this phosphorylation of RAF in cells is still contentious (3Wellbrock C. Karasarides M. Marais R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The presence of two RAS-binding domains and the conformational changes in RAF predict a complicated activation process for RAF (3Wellbrock C. Karasarides M. Marais R. Nat. Rev. Mol.

RAF adopts at least two conformations, closed and open (14Avruch J. Khokhlatchev A. Kyriakis J.M. Luo Z. Tzivion G. Vavvas D. Zhang X.F. Recent Prog. Horm.

In the closed conformation, an intramolecular interaction between the CRD at the N terminus of RAF and the catalytic domain (CAD) at the C terminus of RAF conceals the CRD from RAS, whereas the RBD is exposed to RAS. Mutants of RAF (such as the point mutation at arginine 89) that cannot be phosphorylated and thus cannot be activated and wild type RAF in the resting state before its activation mainly adopt the closed conformation, whereas wild type RAF after phosphorylation to the active form adopts the open conformation (17Terai K. Matsuda M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). How the RAF conformation changes from the closed to the open conformation and whether the opening of the conformation of RAF is the cause or the effect of RAF activation are still unclear. RAS-binding domain cysteine-rich domain catalytic domain total internal reflection fluorescence phosphatidylserine. Recently, we studied the mechanism whereby RAF recognizes the activation of RAS in living cells using single-molecule imaging and single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging of RAF molecules tagged with GFPs (18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Local interactions between RBD and/or CRD and RAS were insufficient for RAF to distinguish RAS-GTP from RAS-GDP, but a closed-to-open conformational change in RAF, which is actively induced by RAS-GTP, was essential for its selective distinction of RAS-GTP from RAS-GDP. When RAF opens, both RBD and CRD of RAF are exposed and associate with RAS-GTP, whereas in the closed form of RAF, only RBD interacts with RAS-GDP. The dissociation between RAF and RAS-GDP is a one-step stochastic process, whereas there are multiple rate-limiting steps in the dissociation of RAF and RAS-GTP (18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the dissociation kinetics of RAF from the ternary complex of RAS-GTP, RAF, and its kinase that forms on the plasma membrane, using single-molecule imaging in living cells. We were interested in the activation of RAF in the early stage (<5 min) of cell stimulation with growth factors because downstream signaling, including ERK activation, begins on this time scale. The activation of RAF is involved in the dissociation of RAF from the plasma membrane (18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We investigated the rate-limiting steps in the activation of RAF, the roles of the two domains in RAF that bind RAS, and the kinetic parameters of the enzymatic reaction between RAF and its kinase. The application of single-molecule measurements aided by mathematical modeling (19Sako Y. Ueda M. Cell Signaling Reactions: Single-molecular Kinetic Analysis. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2010Google Scholar) was expected to be a powerful tool with which to achieve our aim. cDNAs of RAF, RBD, RBD-CRD, and RAFS621A were constructed as described previously (12Hibino K. Watanabe T.M. Kozuka J. Iwane A.H. Okada T. Kataoka T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Chem. Phys. Chem. 2003; 4: 748-753Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). cDNAs of CRD and RAFR89A,S621A were constructed by the direct point mutation of R89A in RBD-CRD and of R89A in RAFS621A, respectively. The cDNA of CAD (amino acids 330–627 of RAF) was cloned as a PCR product from RAFWT. Each cDNA was cloned into the pEGFP vector (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan) with a monomeric mutation (A206K), to prevent the dimer formation between GFPs, and transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After transfection, the cells were cultured for 12 h in DMEM (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% FBS and then serum-starved for 16 h in minimal essential medium (MEM) without phenol red (Nissui), supplemented with 1% BSA (BSA; MEM-BSA). Immediately before the experiments, the culture medium was changed to MEM-BSA containing 5 mm PIPES (pH 7.4). Cells that were 80% confluent on a 60-mm diameter dish were transfected with the cDNAs, cultured overnight, washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and then harvested. The cells were solubilized with SDS sample buffer, separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was incubated with a primary antibody directed against GFP (Takara) or c-RAF (BD Biosciences) and with a secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and stained using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/p-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride color development substrate (Promega, Madison, WI). To detect the phosphorylation of RAF, the cells transfected with the cDNAs and serum-starved, as described above, were treated with or without 100 ng ml−1 EGF (Upstate Millipore) for 5 min. One of the following primary antibodies was used to detect phosphorylated RAF: anti-Ser(P)259 RAF (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-Ser(P)338 RAF (Upstate Millipore), anti-Ser(P)621 RAF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or a anti-Tyr(P)340/341 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Single molecules of GFP-tagged proteins were observed in living cells using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope based on an inverted microscope (IX81, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 60× NA 1.45 objective (PlanApo, Olympus). The specimens were illuminated with the 488 nm line of an Ar+ laser (543-A-A03, Omnichrome, Chino, CA), and the fluorescence images were acquired at an emission wavelength of 500–550 nm using an EM-CCD camera (ImagEM, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) at a frame rate of 0.033 s. The cells were stimulated with 100 ng ml−1 EGF (final concentration) on the microscope at 25 °C. Single molecules on the basal membranes of the cells were observed in the period 2–5 min after stimulation with EGF and recorded directly in a digital format. Details of the single-molecule imaging and image processing are described elsewhere (20Hibino K. Hiroshima M. Takahashi M. Sako Y. Lee J.W. Foote R.S. Micro and Nano Technologies in Bioanalysis: Methods and Protocols. 48. Humana Press, New York, NY2009: 451-460Google Scholar). Single-molecule detection and tracking were performed with in-house software (12Hibino K. Watanabe T.M. Kozuka J. Iwane A.H. Okada T. Kataoka T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Chem. Phys. Chem. 2003; 4: 748-753Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Statistical and kinetic analyses were performed with Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) and Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL). Numerical calculation of the kinetic models and curve fitting were performed with MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). cDNAs of the whole molecule of RAF and fragments or mutants of RAF containing one or two of the three functional domains (RBD, CRD, and CAD) required for its association with the plasma membrane components were fused with GFP cDNA and transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). GFP-RAF, GFP-RBD, and RBD-CRD-GFP are the same molecules that we have used in our previous study (18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In CRD-GFP, arginine 89 in the RBD-CRD-GFP was substituted with alanine (R89A) because CRD is a short fragment that encompasses residues 139–184 of RAF (21Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the fusion of CRD alone with GFP is thought to have no RAS binding activity. Because the R89A mutation in RBD inhibits the association between RAS and RBD (18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Block C. Janknecht R. Herrmann C. Nassar N. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), RBD-CRDR89A-GFP is expected to behave like CRD-GFP. A double mutant of RAF, R89A,S621A, was used as CRD-CAD. The single R89A mutation of RAF associated with the plasma membrane as weakly as the nonspecific association of GFP alone because before its activation, RAF adopts the closed form, in which CRD is concealed from RAS (18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, RAFR89A cannot be used as CRD-CAD. The S621A mutation was introduced in addition to R89A to open the conformation of RAF (17Terai K. Matsuda M. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Intramolecular FRET measurements showed that the single S621A mutant takes an open conformation, independent of RAS activation (18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The expression of GFP-tagged molecules with the expected molecular weights was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). In cells stimulated with EGF to activate RAS, the spatial distribution of the GFP-tagged molecules was observed using confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C). GFP-RAF and RBD-CRD-GFP showed strong accumulation at the cell surface, whereas GFP-RBD, CRD-GFP, and GFP-CRD-CAD remained in the cytoplasm, with only slight accumulation at the cell surface. CAD-GFP was present in the cytoplasm. These results are consistent with those of our previous study (18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation levels at Ser-259 and Ser-338 in the whole RAF molecule increased when the cells were stimulated with EGF (Fig. 2). Although the phosphorylation at Ser-259 has been reported to be independent of growth factor stimulation (23Moelling K. Schad K. Bosse M. Zimmermann S. Schweneker M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31099-31106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), it increased slightly with EGF stimulation in an average of three independent experiments. The changes in the phosphorylation level at Ser-259 after the stimulation showed a large deviation between the experiments, suggesting that the phosphorylation at Ser-259 is highly sensitive to the intrinsic states of cells. Phosphorylation at Ser-338 increased markedly. The phosphorylation at Ser-43 and Ser-621 was observed to be independent of EGF stimulation. The phosphorylation at Tyr-340/341 was not clear. The phosphorylation of other sites could not be examined because we lacked the appropriate antibodies. It was difficult to detect the phosphorylation of CAD and CRD-CAD, probably because of their low affinity for the association sites on the plasma membrane at which phosphorylation takes place (Fig. 1C). RBD, CRD, and RBD-CRD contain no known phosphorylation sites. Cells expressing each GFP-tagged molecule derived from RAF were observed with a TIRF microscope during the 2–5-min period after the cells were treated with EGF (Fig. 3). The significant associations of the GFP-tagged molecules listed in Fig. 1A with the basal cell membrane were observed, with the exception of CAD-GFP (Fig. 3A, right, and B). Although the accumulation of GFP-RBD, CRD-GFP, and GFP-CRD-CAD on the plasma membrane was not evident with confocal microscopy (Fig. 1C), the association of these molecules with the plasma membrane was clearly detected using TIRF microscopy. Although TIRF microscopy has a limited excitation depth (∼200 nm from the coverslip), it is possible that bright fluorescence objects deep inside cells are misidentified as the dim fluorescent spots on the plasma membrane. However, vesicles and the Golgi apparatus with intense GFP signals were not observed in our specimen using epifluorescence microscopy. Free GFP molecules in the cytoplasm are not detected as spots at the video rate (30 frames s−1) used in our experiments because of the rapid Brownian diffusion (20Hibino K. Hiroshima M. Takahashi M. Sako Y. Lee J.W. Foote R.S. Micro and Nano Technologies in Bioanalysis: Methods and Protocols. 48. Humana Press, New York, NY2009: 451-460Google Scholar). In addition, the spots on the membrane have the spatial fluorescence intensity profiles of the point-spread function of the optics, which is one of the criteria to confirm single-molecule detection (20Hibino K. Hiroshima M. Takahashi M. Sako Y. Lee J.W. Foote R.S. Micro and Nano Technologies in Bioanalysis: Methods and Protocols. 48. Humana Press, New York, NY2009: 451-460Google Scholar). From these reasons, we concluded that the fluorescent spots of GFP-RBD, CRD-GFP, and GFP-CRD-CAD molecules were attached on the plasma membrane. Because CAD-GFP associated with the membrane at a much lower frequency than the other molecules, even after EGF stimulation, and the frequency was as low as that for GFP alone, CAD-GFP was not analyzed further. For the GFP-tagged molecules other than CAD, the duration of their association with the plasma membrane (the “on-time”) was measured for individual molecules in single-molecule movies (Fig. 3C). The distribution of the on-times (Fig. 4) contains information about the reaction kinetics between each molecule and the association sites on the plasma membrane, i.e. information about their interaction with RAS, their interaction with kinase, and their phosphorylation.FIGURE 4Analyses of the on-time distributions. The on-time distributions measured in the period 3–5 min after stimulation of the cells are shown for GFP-tagged molecules derived from RAF. N indicates the number of molecules measured. Lines are the results of fitting to the data with the kinetic models for the phosphorylation and dissociation of each species of molecules. The effect of photobleaching was included in the fitting functions, but the values of the kinetic rate constants given under “Results” have been corrected for photobleaching (see under “Results” and see supplemental material for details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The on-time distributions for the GFP-RBD and CRD-GFP fragments in cells stimulated with EGF can be described by a single exponential function, suggesting that these fragments dissociate from RAS-GTP in a single step stochastic process (Fig. 4, A and B). The state in which a molecule anchors to the plasma membrane only by the interaction between its RBD and RAS-GTP is designated “R” in this study (independent of the molecular species). The reaction scheme for the dissociation of RBD is R⟹k1ϕSCHEME A where k1 is the dissociation rate constant between RBD and RAS-GTP and φ is the dissociation state in the cytoplasm (without phosphorylation). Similarly, the dissociation of CRD is described by the scheme C⟹k2ϕSCHEME B where C represents the state in which a molecule anchors to the plasma membrane by the interaction between RAS and its CRD, and k2 is the dissociation rate constant between CRD and RAS-GTP. From the on-time distributions, k1 and k2 were calculated to be 3.7 and 2.3 s−1, respectively (see supplemental text). The on-time distribution of RBD-CRD-GFP showed a peak as we have reported previously (18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of multiple rate-limiting steps in the dissociation process (Fig. 4C). The most probable candidates for the multiple rate-limiting steps in the dissociation of RBD-CRD are the sequential dissociations of RBD and CRD from RAS for the following two reasons. First, the RBD-CRD fragment contains both intact RBD and CRD, but no known phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the fragment does not interact with the kinases involved in RAF activation. Second, because the closed conformation of RAF is maintained by the intramolecular interaction between CRD and CAD, the open/closed conformational change does not take place in RBD-CRD, which lacks CAD. Next, we considered the kinetic intermediate for RBD-CRD. In the previous work (18Hibino K. Shibata T. Yanagida T. Sako Y. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 1277-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we reported that RAF initially contacts RAS-GTP using RBD, and immediately thereafter, the RAF conformation is opened by RAS-GTP and CRD simultaneously associates with RAS-GTP. This transition in the RAF conformation and the interaction between RAS-GTP and RAF were completed more rapidly than the temporal resolution of our experiment (<0.1 s). In the presence of a functional CRD, both RBD and CRD associate with RAS in the initial binding state, and the lifetime of the R state is negligible because of the rapid association of CRD with RAS in the single-molecule kinetic pathway. Therefore, we assumed that the major kinetically observable dissociation intermediate for RBD-CRD is the “C” state. This assumption is supported by a more general sequential dissociation model (supplemental Fig. 1). The scheme for the dissociation of RBD-CRD is RCk1⟵k1rC⟹k2ϕ SCHEME C Here, RC represents the state in which the molecule associates with RAS using both RBD and CRD simultaneously, and k1r is the first-order association rate constant of RBD from the C state. The value of k1r was determined to be 0.9 s−1 from the on-time distribution of RBD-CRD-GFP, when the values for k1 and k2 determined in the previous section were used (see supplemental material for details). The dissociation kinetics of the RBD, CRD, and RBD-CRD fragments were analyzed by globally fitting the reaction equations derived from Schemes A–C to the on-time distributions (Fig. 4, A–C) (see the supplemental material for the details). The results of this fitting are shown in Fig. 4, and the best-fit values for the reaction rate constants were k1 = 3.6 s−1, k1r = 1.0 s−1, and k2 = 2.1 s−1. The results of global fitting agree with those for the local fitting of each fragment described in the previous sections. In addition to their interaction with RAS, GFP-RAF and GFP-CRD-CAD possibly interact with the kinases involved in RAF activation, as do their substrates (Fig. 1A). The on-time distribution of RAF (Fig. 4D) showed a peak similar to that for RBD-CRD. Although the on-time distribution of CRD-CAD showed no obvious intermediate peak, it was not fitted to a single exponential function (Fig. 4E). As in the case of RBD-CRD, it is highly probable that the sequential dissociation of RBD and CRD underlies the dissociation kinetics for the whole RAF molecule, but not for CRD-CAD. The formation of a complex with the kinases, followed by their phosphorylation, would provide additional rate-limiting steps in the dissociation kinetics of RAF and CRD-CAD. In fact, the on-time distribution of RAF looks longer than that of RBD-CRD, suggesting the presence of additional rate-limiting steps (Fig. 4). A reaction scheme for the dissociation of RAF was constructed as an extension of Scheme C by adding the phosphorylation process (Fig. 5, Scheme D). The reaction scheme for CRD-CAD (Fig. 5, Scheme E) is part of Scheme D for RAF. In Schemes D and E, phosphorylation is assumed to be a Michaelis-Menten-type reaction. RCX is the state of the ternary complex formed between RAF, RAS, and the kinase, in which RAF binds to RAS via both RBD and CRD, and CX is the state of the ternary complex in which RAF (or CRD-CAD) binds to RAS only via CRD. RCp, Cp, and φp are the phosphorylated forms of RC, C, and φ, respectively. X is the state of the complex between RAF and the kinase on the plasma membrane when it has dissociated from RAS. Although it is possible that RAF molecules interact with the kinases repeatedly during a single membrane association event, this possibility is not considered in Scheme D (Fig 5). Furthermore, although multiple"
https://openalex.org/W2022307344,"LKB1 is a tumor suppressor that is constitutionally mutated in a cancer-prone condition, called Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, as well as somatically inactivated in a sizeable fraction of lung and cervical neoplasms. The LKB1 gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase that associates with the pseudokinase STRAD (STE-20-related pseudokinase) and the scaffolding protein MO25, the formation of this heterotrimeric complex promotes allosteric activation of LKB1. We have previously reported that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) binds to and stabilizes LKB1. Combining pharmacological studies and RNA interference approaches, we now provide evidence that the co-chaperone Cdc37 participates to the regulation of LKB1 stability. It is known that the Hsp90–Cdc37 complex recognizes a surface within the N-terminal catalytic lobe of client protein kinases. In agreement with this finding, we found that the chaperones Hsp90 and Cdc37 interact with an LKB1 isoform that differs in the C-terminal region, but not with a novel LKB1 variant that lacks a portion of the kinase N-terminal lobe domain. Reconstitution of the two complexes LKB1–STRAD and LKB1–Hsp90–Cdc37 with recombinant proteins revealed that the former is catalytically active whereas the latter is inactive. Furthermore, consistent with a documented repressor function of Hsp90, LKB1 kinase activity was transiently stimulated upon dissociation of Hsp90. Finally, disruption of the LKB1–Hsp90 complex favors the recruitment of both Hsp/Hsc70 and the U-box dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) that triggers LKB1 degradation. Taken together, our results establish that the Hsp90–Cdc37 complex controls both the stability and activity of the LKB1 kinase. This study further shows that two chaperone complexes with antagonizing activities, Hsp90–Cdc37 and Hsp/Hsc70–CHIP, finely control the cellular level of LKB1 protein."

Here, we show that caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), another subfamily of the death domain-fold superfamily, multimerize by employing at least two of the three reported interaction types that were identified in DDs.

This oligomerization allows binding of receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2). In addition, we show that a 1:1 interaction between ASC and procaspase-1 is sufficient for procaspase-1 to gain proteolytic activity, whereas the formation of a higher order CARD complex involving ASC, procaspase-1, and RIP2 is required for effective procaspase-1-mediated NF-κB activation.

Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar, 19Miao E.A. Leaf I.A. Treuting P.M. Mao D.P. Dors M. Sarkar A. Warren S.E. Wewers M.D. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Depending on the molecular composition of the inflammasome, procaspase-1 is either recruited to the complex by the PYD- and CARD-containing adaptor ASC (PYCARD) or directly by a CARD-containing inflammasome sensor protein, such as NLRC4 (20Broz P. von Moltke J. Jones J.W. Vance R.E. Monack D.M. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Second, we previously reported that the CARD of procaspase-1 can mediate NF-κB activation by recruiting the serine/threonine kinase RIP2 through a CARD-CARD interaction (21Lamkanfi M. Kalai M. Saelens X. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24785-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the CARD of procaspase-1 uses different interaction types and patches to perform each function. The human genome encodes three CARD-only proteins (COP, INCA, and ICEBERG) at the caspase-1 locus, which arose from evolutionarily recent duplications of procaspase-1 (22Kersse K. Vanden Berghe T. Lamkanfi M. Vandenabeele P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1508-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23da Cunha J.P. Galante P.A. de Souza S.J. J. Mol. Evol. 2008; 66: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These three proteins have a high degree of sequence identity with the CARD of procaspase-1 (92, 81, and 53%, respectively). Interestingly, although these procaspase-1-related CARD-only proteins are all negative feedback regulators of caspase-1 activity, only COP has retained the ability to interact with RIP2 and to mediate NF-κB signaling (24Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J.

These observations indicate that INCA and ICEBERG acquired during evolution additional missense mutations that specifically affect their ability to activate NF-κB and that a few residues within these CARDs determine functionality. Therefore, targeted mutagenesis could be used to identify which residues in the CARD of procaspase-1 are critical for its inflammasome-mediated proteolytic activation and for the RIP2-dependent NF-κB activation. In this study, we show that the CARD of procaspase-1 can engage at least two of the three designated DD interaction types. Using a targeted mutagenesis approach, we demonstrate that two residues in the CARD of procaspase-1, Asp-27 and Arg-45, are essential for engagement of ASC and auto-oligomerization of the procaspase-1 CARD, respectively. Asp-27 and Arg-45 form an integral part of patches Ib and IIIa, and this classifies their interactions as type I and type III, respectively. Arg-45-mediated procaspase-1 CARD auto-oligomerization is a prerequisite for RIP2 binding, whereas Asp-27-mediated recruitment of the inflammasome adapter ASC has a strong synergistic effect on procaspase-1-mediated RIP2-dependent NF-κB activation. Furthermore, we report that the proteolytic activation of procaspase-1 relies only on a type I interaction between the CARDs of procaspase-1 and ASC and that auto-oligomerization of the procaspase-1 CARD is dispensable for this function. The PCR-generated cDNA encoding human full-length procaspase-1 was cloned in-frame with an N-terminal FLAG tag epitope in the pCAGGS vector (pCAGGS-FLAG-procaspase-1 WT). The enzymatically inactive human procaspase-1 C285A mutant was made by site-directed mutagenesis PCR and cloned in-frame with a FLAG tag epitope in pCAGGS (pCAGGS-FLAG-procaspase-1 C285A). The CARD and the catalytic domain of human procaspase-1 were amplified from full-length human procaspase-1 by conventional PCR and cloned in-frame with a FLAG tag epitope in pCAGGS (pCAGGS-FLAG-caspase-1 CARD-only and pCAGGS-FLAG-caspase-1 p30). Plasmid pCAGGS-E-caspase-1 CARD-only has been described (21Lamkanfi M. Kalai M. Saelens X. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol.

D27G and R45D mutations were introduced in human procaspase-1 by site-directed mutagenesis PCR in each of the following constructs: pCAGGS-FLAG-procaspase-1 WT, pCAGGS-FLAG-procaspase-1 C285A, pCAGGS-FLAG-caspase-1 CARD-only, and pCAGGS-E-caspase-1 CARD-only. All PCR products were sequenced to ensure that no errors had been introduced. We made pCAGGS-E-ASC by cloning the human ASC sequence from pCR3.1-FLAG-ASC (produced in the laboratory of Prof. J. Tschopp; University of Lausanne, Epalignes, Switzerland) in-frame with an N-terminal E-tag epitope in the pCAGGS vector. pCR3-VSV-RIP2 and pβact-βgal (encoding β-galactosidase driven by the β-actin promoter) were also kindly provided by Prof. J. Tschopp. pCR3-VSV-RIP2 has been described (28Thome M. Hofmann K. Burns K. Martinon F. Bodmer J.L. Mattmann C. Tschopp J. Curr.

Israël (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). pCAGGS-pro-IL-1β has been described (29Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Van den Brande I. Van Loo G. Molemans F. Schotte P. Van Criekinge W.

The monoclonal antibody against actin was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Illkirch, France; catalog no. 69100). The FLAG-HRP (catalog no. A8592) and VSV (catalog no. V4888) antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, whereas the E-HRP antibody was obtained from GE Healthcare (catalog no. 27-9413-01, discontinued). The antibody recognizing the pro and mature forms of IL-1β was obtained from R&D Systems (catalog no. AF-401-NA). Secondary antibodies were purchased from GE Healthcare, except for the anti-goat antibody, which was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA; catalog no. sc-2020). siRNA directed against human RIP2 was obtained from Ambion (Foster City, CA; catalog no. AM51331, siRNA ID no. 456, GGAGAAGAAUUUGCCAAAGtt). As a negative control, we used siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog no. D-001810-10-20). Recombinant human TNF was produced in Escherichia coli in our laboratory and purified to at least 99% homogeneity. Its specific biological activity was 2.58 × 107 units/mg of purified protein, as determined with the international standard code 87/650 (National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, Potters Bar, UK). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.4 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. 20 nm siRNA and the indicated amounts of plasmid DNA were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. siRNA transfection was performed 1 day before plasmid DNA transfection. HEK293T cells in 24-well plates were transfected with 5 or 50 ng of the indicated expression vectors in combination with 20 ng of pNF-ConLuc and 20 ng pβact-βgal. Total DNA was equalized with control plasmid. In some experiments, cells were treated with 500 units/ml TNF 6 h before harvesting. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were collected, washed in PBS, and lysed in 80 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm 1,2-cyclohexaminediaminetetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). After combining 20 μl of lysate with 40 μl of substrate buffer (658 μm luciferin, 378 mm coenzyme A, and 742 μm ATP), NF-κB activity was quantified with the GloMax™ 96 Plate Luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activity in cell lysates was assayed by colorimetry to normalize for transfection efficiency. In brief, 20 μl of cell lysate was incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 200 μl of a solution containing 5 mm chlorophenol red–β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Applied Science; catalog no. 884308), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 60 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0. Absorbance was measured at 595 nm. Results are expressed as relative luciferase units/second per optical density of β-galactosidase activity. For the co-immunoprecipitation assays, HEK293T cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of the indicated plasmids. They were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science; catalog no. 11-873-580). Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated by using specific antibodies in combination with protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare; catalog no. 17-0618-01) or FLAG antibody-coupled beads (Sigma-Aldrich; catalog no. A2220). Immune complexes and total lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The procaspase-1 CARD was modeled on the Apaf-1 CARD (Protein Data Bank ID code 1CY5) with the FoldX plugin for Yasara (30Schymkowitz J. Borg J. Stricher F. Nys R. Rousseau F. Serrano L.

Structure were visualized with PyMOL (32DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 1.3r1. Schrödinger, LLC, New York2010Google Scholar). The electrostatic potential of the proteins was mapped on their individual solvent-accessible surfaces using the APBS plug-in in PyMOL (33Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5906) Google Scholar). Structures were aligned with the CEAlign plug-in in PyMOL (34Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). The only crystal structure of a CARD-CARD interaction reported so far revealed that the CARDs of Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 interact through surface patches complementary in charge and shape (35Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The acidic, convex surface patch of the Apaf-1 CARD recognizes the basic, concave surface patch of the procaspase-9 CARD (35Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). We found that the CARD of procaspase-1 also harbors two differently charged surface patches on opposite sides (Fig. 1A). To study the contribution of each surface patch of procaspase-1 to procaspase-1-mediated NF-κB activation, we performed a mutation-based structure-function analysis in which a single point mutation was introduced at the differently charged procaspase-1 CARD surface patches. The aspartic acid at position 27 (Asp-27) was selected for the acidic patch of procaspase-1 CARD because the crystal structure of the interaction between Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 revealed that this residue forms an integral part of the acidic interaction patch of Apaf-1 (Fig. 1A) (35Qin H. Srinivasula S.M. Wu G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). For the basic patch, on the other hand, the arginine at position 45 (Arg-45) was selected empirically (Fig. 1A). To mimic the amino acid sequences of INCA and ICEBERG, the two procaspase-1-related CARD-only proteins that fail to activate NF-κB (24Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 25Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 51729-51738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we mutated Asp-27 and Arg-45 into a glycine (D27G) and an aspartic acid (R45D), respectively (Fig. 1B). Using NF-κB reporter assays, we then compared the ability of the mutants to activate NF-κB when they are ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells. We found that both mutations abrogated the NF-κB-activating potential when full-length procaspase-1 or the CARD-only portion of the protein (caspase-1 CARD-only) was expressed (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that effective procaspase-1-mediated NF-κB signaling requires CARD-CARD interactions involving the two differently charged surface patches on opposite sides of the CARD of procaspase-1. To characterize better the nature of the CARD-CARD interactions that contribute to procaspase-1-mediated NF-κB signaling, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells ectopically expressing RIP2 in the presence of either wild-type caspase-1 CARD-only or one of the mutants. Arg-45 in the basic surface patch of procaspase-1 CARD seems to be essential for recruitment of the downstream NF-κB mediator RIP2 because the caspase-1 CARD-only R45D mutant failed to interact with RIP2 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, Asp-27 in the acidic surface patch of procaspase-1 CARD does not seem to be required for RIP2 recruitment (Fig. 2A). Several CARD-containing proteins undergo CARD-dependent auto-oligomerization to recruit downstream effectors and activate signaling pathways (36Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 37Coussens N.P. Mowers J.C. McDonald C. Nuñez G. Ramaswamy S.

Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1319-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To examine whether auto-oligomerization of procaspase-1 CARD is necessary for NF-κB activation, we analyzed the ability of caspase-1 CARD-only mutants to form auto-oligomers and compared these results with their ability to recruit RIP2. In agreement with a critical role for Arg-45 in RIP2 recruitment, mutation of this residue precluded procaspase-1 CARD auto-oligomerization (Fig. 2B). Conversely, mutation of Asp-27, located in the acidic patch, did not hamper procaspase-1 CARD auto-oligomerization (Fig. 2B) or RIP2 recruitment. Together, these results indicate that procaspase-1 CARD auto-oligomerization correlates with RIP2 recruitment and that these processes rely on residue Arg-45. However, the observation that Asp-27 and Arg-45 of procaspase-1 CARD are both necessary for efficient NF-κB activation points to a model in which procaspase-1 CARD needs to engage CARD-CARD interactions at opposite sides of its surface to induce NF-κB activation. Although CARD-CARD interactions involving Arg-45 of procaspase-1 CARD allow assembly of procaspase-1 oligomers that most likely enable recruitment of RIP2, the resultant protein complex is incapable of triggering NF-κB signaling. In addition, the Asp-27-containing surface patch of procaspase-1 CARD has to recruit other unknown proteins to the complex. The bipartite PYD-CARD adaptor protein, ASC, is a recognized interaction partner of procaspase-1 CARD that enables recruitment of procaspase-1 to ASC-containing inflammasomes to allow procaspase-1 activation (20Broz P. von Moltke J. Jones J.W. Vance R.E. Monack D.M. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 39Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Erickson S. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Because the involvement of ASC in NF-κB activation is still debated, we assessed the effect of ASC on procaspase-1-mediated NF-κB activation. To this end, we ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells modest amounts of full-length procaspase-1 or the isolated CARD of procaspase-1 in the absence or presence of ASC and monitored NF-κB activation by using an NF-κB-dependent reporter system. Addition of ASC resulted in a 10-fold increase in NF-κB activity compared with expression of procaspase-1, the isolated CARD of procaspase-1, or ASC alone (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 1A). In agreement with experiments utilizing dominant negative RIP2 mutants (21Lamkanfi M. Kalai M. Saelens X. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24785-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), transcriptional down-regulation of RIP2 with specific siRNA oligonucleotides selectively abrogated procaspase-1-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 1A). Importantly, RIP2 repression had no effect on the modest NF-κB induction obtained when expressing ASC alone, but it completely inhibited the synergistic effect of ASC on procaspase-1-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 1A). The specificity of these effects is illustrated by the observation that TNF-induced NF-κB activation, which proceeds independently of RIP2 (40Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galán J.E. Núñez G. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), was unaffected by either RIP2 knockdown or ASC co-expression (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 1A). Collectively, these results indicate that ASC has a strong synergistic effect on procaspase-1-mediated, RIP2-dependent NF-κB activation and suggest that the CARD of procaspase-1 functions as a bridging moiety that enables recruitment of RIP2 to ASC-containing protein complexes to allow NF-κB signaling. Analysis of the procaspase-1 CARD mutants in this ASC synergy model revealed that the defect in NF-κB activation by the Arg-45 mutant can be partially rescued by ASC co-expression (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 1B). However, NF-κB activation was not induced by the Asp-27 mutant despite co-expression of ASC (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 1B). These observations correlate with the ability of the procaspase-1 CARD mutants to interact with ASC. Whereas residue Asp-27 in the CARD of procaspase-1 appears to be indispensible for ASC binding, residue Arg-45 does not seem to be crucial because its mutation reduced but did not prevent the ability of procaspase-1 to co-immunoprecipitate with ASC (Fig. 3C). As a result, ASC co-expression only partially restored the NF-κB signaling capacity in the case of Arg-45 mutation. Remarkably, this restoration of NF-κB activation was blocked by depletion of RIP2 (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 1B), suggesting that ASC co-expression enables RIP2 to bind to the complex, even though our results show that residue Arg-45 in the CARD of procaspase-1 is important for RIP2 binding (Fig. 2A). By these results, we indicate that residue Asp-27 of the procaspase-1 CARD forms an essential component of the ASC docking site. Having identified two residues, Asp-27 and Arg-45, located on opposite sides of the procaspase-1 CARD as being critical for procaspase-1-mediated NF-κB activation, we next assessed their contribution to induction of procaspase-1 activation and maturation of IL-1β, the well recognized caspase-1 function. For this purpose, we developed a system that adequately circumvents two important technical issues: expressing large amounts of wild-type procaspase-1 is cytotoxic, and it induces procaspase-1 activation regardless of its CARD because a CARDless caspase-1 variant also attains proteolytic activity when it is overexpressed in large amounts (data not shown). Therefore, we used an intricate cellular system in which minute amounts of procaspase-1 gain proteolytic activity only when expressed in the presence of ASC (Fig. 4). As a read-out to monitor caspase-1 activity, we followed the conversion of pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β and found that mutating Asp-27 of procaspase-1 precluded activation of procaspase-1 (Fig. 4). These findings are in line with the ability of the procaspase-1 CARD mutants to interact with ASC. Indeed, mutating Arg-45 in the CARD of procaspase-1 had only a minor effect on ASC recruitment (Fig. 3C), and consequently, it did not affect the proteolytic activation of procaspase-1 (Fig. 4). These data suggest that procaspase-1 is recruited by ASC into ASC-containing inflammasomes through CARD-CARD interactions involving a surface patch that contains Asp-27 and is located on the acidic surface region of procaspase-1 CARD. Notably, auto-oligomerization of procaspase-1 CARD, mediated by an Arg-45-containing surface patch on the basic surface region, d"
https://openalex.org/W2028291725,"The novel uncoupling proteins (UCP2-5) are implicated in the mitochondrial control of oxidant production, insulin signaling, and aging. Attempts to understand their functions have been complicated by overlapping expression patterns in most organisms. Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes are unique because they express only one UCP ortholog, ceUCP4 (ucp4). Here, we performed detailed metabolic analyzes in genetically modified nematodes to define the function of the ceUCP4. The knock-out mutant ucp4 (ok195) exhibited sharply decreased mitochondrial succinate-driven (complex II) respiration. However, respiratory coupling and electron transport chain function were normal in ucp4 mitochondria. Surprisingly, isolated ucp4 mitochondria showed markedly decreased succinate uptake. Similarly, ceUCP4 inhibition blocked succinate respiration and import in wild type mitochondria. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of complex I function was selectively lethal to ucp4 worms, arguing that ceUCP4-regulated succinate transport is required for optimal complex II function in vivo. Additionally, ceUCP4 deficiency prolonged lifespan in the short-lived mev1 mutant that exhibits complex II-generated oxidant production. These results identify a novel function for ceUCP4 in the regulation of complex II-based metabolism through an unexpected mechanism involving succinate transport."
https://openalex.org/W2040926027,"The activation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2)α (cPLA(2)α) plays an important role in initiating the inflammatory response. The regulation of cPLA(2)α mRNA turnover has been proposed to control cPLA(2)α gene expression under cytokine and growth factor stimulation. However, the detailed mechanism is still unknown. In this report, we have demonstrated that the cPLA(2)α mRNA stability was increased under IL-1β treatment in A549 cells. By using EMSAs, HuR was identified as binding with the cPLA(2)α mRNA 3'-UTR, and the binding region was located at nucleotides 2716-2807, a fragment containing AUUUA flanked by U-rich sequences. IL-1β treatment enhanced the association of cPLA(2)α mRNA with cytosolic HuR. The reduction of HuR expression by RNA interference technology inhibited IL-1β-induced cPLA(2)α mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, blocking the p38 MAPK signaling pathway with SB203580 abolished the effect of IL-1β-induced cPLA(2)α gene expression. Phosphorylation at residue Thr-118 of HuR is crucial in regulating the interaction between HuR and its target mRNAs. Mutation of HuR Thr-118 reduced the association between HuR and cPLA(2)α mRNA under IL-1β treatment. This inhibitory effect was also observed in binding with COX-2 mRNA. This result indicated that p38 MAPK-mediated Thr-118 phosphorylation may play a key role in regulating the interaction of HuR with its target mRNAs in inflammation."

This study demonstrates that in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, expression of c-JUN, JUN-B, c-FOS, and FOS-B was induced by the AAR, whereas JUN-D, FRA-1, and FRA-2 were not. Of the four activated FOS/JUN members, c-JUN made the largest contribution to the induction of several known AAR target genes. For several human liver, prostate, and ovarian cell lines, the AAR-induced increase in c-JUN expression was greater in transformed cells compared with nontransformed counterparts, an effect independent of cell growth rate. Thus far, the best characterized AA-responsive genes are all transcriptionally activated by ATF4, but the AAR-dependent induction of c-JUN transcription was ATF4-independent. The increased expression of c-JUN was dependent on ATF2 and on activation of the MEK-ERK and JNK arms of the MAPK signaling pathways. Formation of c-JUN-ATF2-activated heterodimers was increased after AA limitation, and c-JUN or ATF2 knockdown suppressed the induction of c-JUN and other AAR target genes. AA deprivation triggers a feed-forward process that involves phosphorylation of existing c-JUN protein by JNK and subsequent auto-activation of the c-JUN gene by recruitment of c-JUN and ATF2 to two AP-1 sites within the proximal promoter.

Lopez M.C. Baker H.V. Kilberg M.S. Physiol. Genomics. 2010; 41: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which these events occur are not fully understood, but protein/AA deprivation activates an AA response (AAR) (8Kilberg M.S. Pan Y.X. Chen H. Leung-Pineda V. Annu. Rev.

The kinase activity of GCN2 is activated by binding uncharged tRNA when there is an increase abundance of any one of the uncharged tRNA molecules. The GCN2 kinase phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α on serine 51, which leads to suppression of general protein synthesis but promotes a paradoxical increase in translation of selected mRNA species, including activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (10Vattem K.M.

Similarly, an AA-dependent signaling pathway has been described that involves activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor (Gα12) followed by Rac1-MEKK1-MKK7-JNK2 signaling and ultimately terminates in ATF2 phosphorylation by JNK2 (15Chaveroux C. Jousse C. Cherasse Y. Maurin A.C. Parry L. Carraro V. Derijard B. Bruhat A. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 6515-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). JNK3 is primarily expressed in brain, but both JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitous and exhibit broad substrate specificity, as reviewed by Bode and Dong (16Bode A.M. Dong Z. Mol. Carcinog. 2007; 46: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because knock-out mice for each are viable and show no major deficiencies, they are often considered to have overlapping specificity, but the validity of that assumption remains open for debate. A principal substrate for the JNKs is c-Jun. JNK2 appears to bind to c-Jun with greater affinity and to target it for degradation, whereas JNK1 may be more effective in phosphorylating c-Jun leading to activation and stabilization (17Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the opposing effects of the JNK1 and JNK2 on the cell cycle and cell proliferation may be the consequence of opposite actions on c-Jun (18Sabapathy K. Wagner E.F. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1520-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, Jaeschke et al. (19Jaeschke A. Karasarides M. Ventura J.J. Ehrhardt A. Zhang C. Flavell R.A. Shokat K.M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 899-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have presented evidence that JNK1 and JNK2 are both positive regulators of c-Jun. It is clear that the precise functions of the JNKs will require additional analyses. Aubel et al. (20Aubel C. Dehez S. Chabanon H. Seva C. Ferrara M. Brachet P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed that amino acid limitation activates JNK1, and Chaveroux et al. (15Chaveroux C. Jousse C. Cherasse Y. Maurin A.C. Parry L. Carraro V. Derijard B. Bruhat A. Fafournoux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 6515-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that amino acid limitation leads to JNK2-mediated phosphorylation and activation of ATF2. An expression microarray analysis following activation of the AAR in HepG2 human hepatoma cells identified several members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors as AA-responsive (7Shan J. Lopez M.C. Baker H.V. Kilberg M.S. Physiol. Genomics. 2010; 41: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and even earlier reports had linked some members of this family of genes to AA deprivation (21Pohjanpelto P. Hölttä E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5814-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). AP-1 complexes are often activated in response to extracellular signals and regulate a variety of biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis (22Lopez-Bergami P. Lau E. Ronai Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The AP-1 superfamily includes the FOS, JUN, ATF, and MAF protein subfamilies (23Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 24Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3261) Google Scholar). The JUN proteins (c-JUN, JUN-B, and JUN-D) can both homodimerize and heterodimerize with other JUN and FOS members (c-FOS, FOS-B, FRA-1, and FRA-2), as well as with ATF members (22Lopez-Bergami P. Lau E. Ronai Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 23Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2453-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), to form complexes with either activating or repressing transcriptional activity. c-JUN, the most studied member of the JUN family, has been linked to cell proliferation, tumor cell survival, and apoptosis (26Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 27Cazanave S.C. Elmi N.A. Akazawa Y. Bronk S.F. Mott J.L. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2010; 299: G236-G243Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Mice lacking c-Jun die at about embryonic day 13 of hepatic failure and heart defects (28Eferl R. Sibilia M. Hilberg F. Fuchsbichler A. Kufferath I. Guertl B. Zenz R. Wagner E.F. Zatloukal K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1049-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), indicating that c-JUN plays an important role in hepatocyte proliferation and survival. The JUN/FOS transcription factors are intimately linked to regulation of cell division and growth (29Shaulian E. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 30Milde-Langosch K. Eur. J.

Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2633-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but relatively little is known about the influence of nutrition on JUN/FOS expression. Complete nutrient starvation of HeLa cells resulted in a down-regulation of c-JUN and JUN-B expression and a corresponding increase in autophagy (32Yogev O. Goldberg R. Anzi S. Yogev O. Shaulian E. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 2318-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Conversely, deprivation of CHO cells for methionine resulted in increased c-Jun, c-Fos, and Jun-B mRNA levels, but the remaining family members were not tested (21Pohjanpelto P. Hölttä E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5814-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the latter studies implicated mRNA stability in the increase in c-JUN and JUN-B, the contribution of transcription was not investigated. Recently, Li et al. (33Li J. Liu J. Song J. Wang X. Weiss H.L. Townsend Jr., C.M. Gao T. Evers B.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 301: C213-C226Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) documented increased neurotensin synthesis and secretion that was mediated by ERK-c-JUN signaling but was negatively modulated by mammalian target of rapamycin. As part of that study, the authors showed that depriving cells of AA led to an increase in both total c-JUN and phosphorylated c-JUN protein levels. Gietzen et al. (34Gietzen D.W. Ross C.M. Hao S. Sharp J.W. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that regions of the mouse brain that exhibit increased eIF2α and ERK activation in response to a threonine-free diet also contained elevated levels of c-Jun. Although no known human cancers have causative c-JUN mutations, many tumors exhibit elevated levels of c-JUN expression. Furthermore, for a number of tumor types, there is evidence that c-JUN activation is a critical factor for transformation and tumorigenesis (22Lopez-Bergami P. Lau E. Ronai Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Conversely, it has been proposed that c-JUN may also exhibit anti-tumorigenic properties in certain circumstances (29Shaulian E. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). One aspect of cancer biology that is not fully understood is the relationship between tumor growth and nutrient availability. In this study, it is shown that selected members of the JUN/FOS transcription factors are AA-regulated genes, and for c-JUN this induction was shown to occur by an ATF4-independent mechanism. When the AAR was activated in several transformed human liver, prostate, and ovarian cell lines, a significant c-JUN induction occurred, but the increase was much less when nontransformed counterparts were tested suggesting a possible link between protein/AA nutrition signaling and the transformed state. The known actions of JUN/FOS on regulation of cell replication and apoptosis would suggest that control of their expression by protein/AA availability is likely to influence cell proliferation and maintenance of the transformed state. Furthermore, the results document that AA deprivation leads to an increase in c-JUN-ATF2 dimerization and auto-activation of the c-JUN gene, which contributes to the induction of downstream AA-responsive genes. Human HepG2 and HuH7 hepatoma cells, SKOV3 ovarian tumor cells, immortalized ISOE80PC ovarian cells, (kindly provided by Dr. Ie-Ming Shih, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine), LNCaP prostate tumor cells, benign BPH-1 prostate cells, and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, pH 7.4) (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The medium was supplemented with 1× nonessential AAs, 2 mm glutamine, 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The HC-04 immortalized human hepatocytes (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown as described previously (35Lim P.L. Tan W. Latchoumycandane C. Mok W.C. Khoo Y.M. Lee H.S. Sattabongkot J. Beerheide W.

After overnight culture, the cells were incubated in medium with or without 2 mm HisOH for 6 h. The cultures were replenished with fresh medium 12 h prior to initiating all treatments to ensure that the cells were in the basal state. The AAR was activated by incubation in culture medium containing 2 mm histidinol (HisOH) which blocks charging of histidine onto the corresponding tRNA and thus activates the AAR pathways by mimicking histidine deprivation, without depleting the cellular histidine level (36Thiaville M.M. Dudenhausen E.E. Zhong C. Pan Y.X. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the following molecules were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): c-JUN (sc-1694), Ser-63 p-c-JUN (sc-822), c-FOS (sc-7202), RNA pol II (sc-899), ATF2 (sc-187), Thr-71 p-ATF2 (sc-8398), Tyr-204 p-ERK (sc-7383), and ERK (sc-94).

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Within an experiment, RNA samples were prepared from triplicate cultures for each condition to measure variation, and multiple experiments were performed to assess reproducibility. To measure steady state mRNA for a specific gene, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed with SYBR Green detection using a DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (Bio-Rad). The PCR primers used are listed in Table 1. To obtain protein extracts, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). The whole cell lysate was sonicated, and protein was quantified before separating on a 10.5–14% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferring to a Trans-Blot PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in TBST (30 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) solution containing 5 or 10% Carnation nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Each primary antibody was diluted in blocking solution and used to incubate the blots for 1–2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed and then incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound secondary antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) after washing with TBST solution. HepG2 cells were treated with 2 mm HisOH for 8 h and washed with ice-cold PBS, and then the cells were incubated with cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA) containing the protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture for 15 min on ice. After mixing with 0.3% Nonidet P-40, samples were centrifuged at 2700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with cell lysis buffer three times and then incubated in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl, and 1.0 mm EDTA) with protease/phosphatase inhibitors on ice for 30 min or −80 °C overnight. The extracts were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected as a nuclear protein extract. An 800-μg aliquot of the nuclear protein extract was pre-cleared with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of recombinant protein G-Sepharose beads 4B (GE Healthcare) for 60 min at 4 °C and then incubated with 2 μg of primary antibody or nonspecific IgG (negative control) overnight at 4 °C. The protein-antibody complex was collected with recombinant protein G-Sepharose 4B beads, washed with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) five times at 4 °C, eluted by boiling in protein-loading buffer, and then processed for immunoblot analysis. HepG2 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 107 per 150-mm dish with complete DMEM, cultured for 24 h, and then given fresh DMEM for 12 h before transfer to either complete DMEM or DMEM containing 2 mm HisOH for 8 h. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was performed as described previously (38Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Purified, immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR using the primer sequences listed in Table 1 and a DNA Engine Opticon 2 system. The PCR product was detected with SYBR Green I (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). To measure transcription activity from a gene, we typically measure the short lived heterogeneous nuclear RNA by qPCR using primers that cross an exon-intron boundary (38Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39Lipson K.E. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 9774-9777Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, because the c-JUN gene lacks introns, the transcription activity was measured by ChIP of RNA polymerase II (pol II) binding, as described by Sandoval et al. (40Sandoval J. Rodríguez J.L. Tur G. Serviddio G. Pereda J. Boukaba A. Sastre J. Torres L. Franco L. López-Rodas G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e88Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that pol II association within the coding region of a gene reflects the transcription activity. The ChIP results are expressed as the ratio to input DNA. Samples were prepared in triplicate for each condition, and each experiment was performed at least twice. The proliferation of cells was determined by a 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (WST-1) assay (Roche Applied Science) following the protocol from the manufacturer. Briefly, 20 × 103 cells were seeded in each well of 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h. At 0, 12, 24, and 48 h after providing the cells with fresh medium, 10 μl of WST-1 reagent was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. The absorbance ratio at 460/655 nm was measured using a microplate reader to obtain the relative number of cells. For transient protein expression studies, HepG2 cells (0.4 × 106 cells per well in 6-well plates or 0.8 × 106 cells per 60-mm dish) were seeded 18–24 h before transfection with expression constructs in pcDNA3.1 using GenJet Reagent II (SignaGen Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), following the manufacturer's protocol. At 8 h post-transfection, the cells were enriched by selecting with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 40 h. Following selection, the cells were transferred to fresh control DMEM for 12 h and then transferred to control DMEM or DMEM containing 2 mm HisOH for 4–16 h prior to collecting RNA and protein for analysis. For Firefly luciferase reporter assays, HepG2 cells (0.05–0.1 × 106 cells per well) were seeded on 24-well plates 18–24 h before transfection with Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at a ratio of 6:l of Superfect to DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2084686496,"The shift from a diurnal to nocturnal lifestyle in vertebrates is generally associated with either enhanced visual sensitivity or a decreased reliance on vision. Within birds, most studies have focused on differences in the visual system across all birds with respect to nocturnality-diurnality. The critically endangered Kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), a parrot endemic to New Zealand, is an example of a species that has evolved a nocturnal lifestyle in an otherwise diurnal lineage, but nothing is known about its' visual system. Here, we provide a detailed morphological analysis of the orbits, brain, eye, and retina of the Kakapo and comparisons with other birds. Morphometric analyses revealed that the Kakapo's orbits are significantly more convergent than other parrots, suggesting an increased binocular overlap in the visual field. The Kakapo exhibits an eye shape that is consistent with other nocturnal birds, including owls and nightjars, but is also within the range of the diurnal parrots. With respect to the brain, the Kakapo has a significantly smaller optic nerve and tectofugal visual pathway. Specifically, the optic tectum, nucleus rotundus and entopallium were significantly reduced in relative size compared to other parrots. There was no apparent reduction to the thalamofugal visual pathway. Finally, the retinal morphology of the Kakapo is similar to that of both diurnal and nocturnal birds, suggesting a retina that is specialised for a crepuscular niche. Overall, this suggests that the Kakapo has enhanced light sensitivity, poor visual acuity and a larger binocular field than other parrots. We conclude that the Kakapo possesses a visual system unlike that of either strictly nocturnal or diurnal birds and therefore does not adhere to the traditional view of the evolution of nocturnality in birds."
https://openalex.org/W2037216032,"Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), a member of the Krüppel-like factor family of transcription factors, has been found to play diverse roles in adipocytes in vitro. However, little is known of the function of KLF15 in adipocytes in vivo. We have now found that the expression of KLF15 in adipose tissue is down-regulated in obese mice, and we therefore generated adipose tissue-specific KLF15 transgenic (aP2-KLF15 Tg) mice to investigate the possible contribution of KLF15 to various pathological conditions associated with obesity in vivo. The aP2-KLF15 Tg mice manifest insulin resistance and are resistant to the development of obesity induced by maintenance on a high fat diet. However, they also exhibit improved glucose tolerance as a result of enhanced insulin secretion. Furthermore, this enhancement of insulin secretion was shown to result from down-regulation of the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) in white adipose tissue and a consequent reduced level of oxidative stress. This is supported by the findings that restoration of SCD1 expression in white adipose tissue of aP2-KLF15 Tg mice exhibited increased oxidative stress in white adipose tissue and reduced insulin secretion with hyperglycemia. Our data thus provide an example of cross-talk between white adipose tissue and pancreatic β cells mediated through modulation of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2081448804,"The interleukin-17 (IL-17) family of cytokines plays important roles in innate immune defenses against bacterial and fungal pathogens. While much is known about IL-17A, much less information is available about the IL-17F isoform. Here, we investigated gene expression and release of IL-17F and its regulation by the complement system. IL-17F was produced in mouse peritoneal elicited macrophages after TLR4 activation by LPS, peaking after 12 h. This effect was completely dependent on the presence of the adaptor protein MyD88. The copresence of the complement activation product, C5a (EC(50)=10 nM), amplified IL-17F production via the receptor C5aR. In vitro signaling studies indicated that LPS or C5a, or the combination, caused phosphorylation of Akt occurring at threonine 308 but not at serine 473. Treatment of macrophages with pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K-Akt greatly reduced production of IL-17F as well as mRNA for IL-17F. In endotoxemia, C5a levels peaked at 6 h, while IL-17F levels peaked between 6-12 h. Full in vivo production of IL-17F during endotoxemia required C5a. A similar result was found in the cecal ligation and puncture sepsis model. These data suggest that maximal production of IL-17F requires complement activation and presence of C5a."

The core serpin domain is highly conserved, and typical serpins are encoded with a molecular size of 35–50 kDa. Here, we describe a novel 93-kDa protein that contains two complete, tandemly arrayed serpin domains. This twin serpin, SPN93, was isolated from the larval hemolymph of the large beetle Tenebrio molitor. The N-terminal serpin domain of SPN93 forms a covalent complex with the Spätzle-processing enzyme, a terminal serine protease of the Toll signaling cascade, whereas the C-terminal serpin domain of SPN93 forms complexes with a modular serine protease and the Spätzle-processing enzyme-activating enzyme, which are two different enzymes of the cascade. Consequently, SPN93 inhibited β-1,3-glucan-mediated Toll proteolytic cascade activation in an in vitro system. Site-specific proteolysis of SPN93 at the N-terminal serpin domain was observed after activation of the Toll proteolytic cascade in vivo, and down-regulation of SPN93 by RNAi sensitized β-1,3-glucan-mediated larval death.

The core domain is strongly conserved, and very few serpins fall outside of this size range. There are also many families of tight binding protease inhibitors, which are typically shorter than 100 amino acids (13Broze Jr., G.J. Girard T.J. Novotny W.F.

The large size of this insect enables us to collect enough hemolymph (insect blood) to purify serine proteases and serpins by biochemical methods. Our studies demonstrated biochemically that the lysine-type polymeric peptidoglycans of Gram-positive bacteria and meso-diaminopimelic acid-type polymeric peptidoglycans of Gram-negative bacteria induce the clustering of the peptidoglycan recognition protein-SA and recruit Gram-negative binding protein 1 (GNBP1) and serine protease zymogen of modular serine protease (MSP), leading to the sequential activation of two downstream serine protease zymogens: Spätzle-processing enzyme-activating enzyme (SAE) and Spätzle-processing enzyme (SPE) (16Kim C.H.

The activated SPE is the terminal serine protease that cleaves pro-Spätzle into activated Spätzle as a Toll ligand. SPE also induced the synthesis of melanin pigment via cleavage of both pro-phenoloxidase and zymogen form of serine protease homolog 1, resulting in formation of a stable melanization complex (19Kan H.

Additionally, we have shown that the GNBP3-mediated β-1,3-glucan recognition signal also activates this serine protease cascade to cleave pro-Spätzle and induces synthesis of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) via the Toll proteolytic signaling pathway (17Roh K.B.

Additionally, we have previously characterized three serpins (SPN40, SPN55, and SPN48) from the larval hemolymph of T. molitor. These serpins form covalent serpin-protease complexes with the three Toll cascade-activating serine proteases (MSP, SAE, and SPE) and cooperatively block the activation of the Toll signaling cascade (20Jiang R.

Contrary to general expectations that the Toll proteolytic cascade is regulated by the activity of a single “master” or “bottleneck” serpin analog, our data indicate that the activity of each serine protease in the Toll proteolytic cascade is specifically inhibited by each specific serpin. Here, we describe a novel 93-kDa protein that contains two complete, tandemly arrayed serpin domains. This twin serpin functions as a master serpin that inhibits all three Toll cascade-regulating serine proteases, resulting in repression of the activation of pro-Spätzle in an in vitro system. Moreover, SPN93 was site-specifically processed following Toll cascade activation in vivo. Also, the 93-kDa serpin plays a regulatory role in the in vivo insect melanization innate immune response. This work is the first example of a tandemly arrayed twin-serpin protein to be characterized. T. molitor larvae (mealworms) were maintained in a terrarium containing wheat bran.

Polyclonal antibodies against native SPN93, a recombinant N-terminal domain of SPN93 (rSPN93-N), and its recombinant C-terminal domain (rSPN93-C) were obtained from immunized rabbits. Serpin fractions were preincubated with 50 ng of aSPE for 15 min at 30 °C in 20 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and were further incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 480 μl of a solution containing 40 μm synthetic α-thrombin substrate (Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA (4-methyl coumaryl-7-amide)). After incubation, 900 μl of 17% (v/v) acetic acid was added to 100 μl of reaction mix to terminate the reaction. Specific amidase activity was detected using a fluorescence spectrophotometer at λex = 380 nm and λem = 460 nm. One unit of the amidase activity was defined as the amount required to liberate 1 nmol of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin/min. The steps to purify SPN93 are shown in Fig. 1A. Briefly, T. molitor larval hemolymph (2 g of protein in 320 ml) was treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (0.5 mm final) for 50 min at 4 °C to inactivate hemolymph serine proteases. Then, diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated hemolymph was dialyzed against Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl and 3 mm EDTA, pH 6.0) for 12 h at 4 °C and applied to a CM-Toyopearl column (3 × 15 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A. After washing the column, proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–1.0 m NaCl) in 300 ml of Buffer A at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions inhibiting aSPE amidase were pooled (120 mg of protein) and dialyzed against Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl and 3 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose FF column (3.5 × 15 cm). Elution was performed using a NaCl gradient (0–1 m NaCl) in 200 ml of Buffer B at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Active fractions (40 mg of protein) were then loaded to a HiTrap Heparin FPLC column equilibrated with Buffer B and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–1.0 m) in 400 ml of Buffer B at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The active fractions were loaded onto a HiTrap SP-Sepharose HP cation exchange column (bed volume 1 ml) equilibrated with Buffer A. An NaCl gradient (0–1.0 m) in 100 ml of Buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used for the elution. Concentrated active fractions (5 mg of protein) were then separated using a TSKgel G2000SWXL HPLC column (4.6 mm × 30 cm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6.0). The active fractions (2 mg of protein) were pooled, concentrated, and dissolved in a saturated sodium phosphate solution to a final concentration of 20 mm. The sample was loaded onto a 1-ml hydroxylapatite FPLC column (5 mm × 50 mm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer D (20 mm sodium phosphate containing 3 mm EDTA, pH 7.0). The column was washed with 4 ml of Buffer D, followed by elution with a 25-ml gradient from 20 to 500 mm sodium phosphate. Fractions 3–5, which contained the 93-kDa proteins (see Fig. 1, B and C) were pooled (800 μg of protein). The N-terminal and internal peptide sequences of SPN93 digested with trypsin were determined using an Applied Biosystems Procise automated gas phase amino acid sequencer. The obtained amino acid sequences are highlighted in underlined blue color in supplemental Fig. S1. Total RNA was isolated from the larval fat body of T. molitor using ISOGEN (WAKO, Osaka, Japan). The cDNA was prepared using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). A DNA fragment encoding a portion of SPN93 was amplified using 93-degenerate-F/R primers (supplemental Table S1) that were designed based on the partial amino acid sequences. The amplified DNA fragment was determined for nucleotide sequence. The internal sequence inside the fragment was amplified with 93-cp-F/R primers (supplemental Table S1), and then the obtained fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as a probe for plaque hybridization (Megaprime hybridization; GE Healthcare). The positive plaques were transformed into SOLR cells by in vivo excision. Nucleotide sequences of the positive clones were determined. The amino acid sequences of Tenebrio SPN93-N and SPN93-C showed high homology with those of Tribolium castaneum SPN3a and SPN5, which locate tandemly on the chromosome 1. Primers of Tribolium SPN3a-F and SPN5-R, shown in supplemental Table S1, were designed based on their gene sequences. A Tribolium cDNA library was used as a template during PCR. The positive plaque isolation followed by nucleotide sequencing was performed as described above. Recombinant SPN93 (rSPN93-NC) was expressed using a baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) in Sf9 insect cells with a pFASTBAC-SEa vector (22Piao S. Song Y.L. Kim J.H. Park S.Y. Park J.W.

An N-terminal His tag was used to isolate rSPN93, which was then cleaved at the tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site and purified using a Hi-Trap Q column. The product contained additional three amino acids (GHM) at the N terminus as a cloning artifact (see Fig. 2E). The N-terminal domain of SPN93 (rSPN93-N), C-terminal domain (rSPN93-C), and N-terminal domain mutant containing a cleavage site mutation (K371Q) were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 strain using a pProEX plasmid. The primers used for cloning were described in supplemental Table S1. Purification strategies were similar to those for rSPN55, rSPN40, and rSPN48 as described previously (20Jiang R. Kim E.H.

Purified rSPN93-NC (100 pmol) and aSPE (50 pmol) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, separated by SDS-PAGE (12%), and then blotted onto a PVDF membrane. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) R-250 stained band corresponding to the released C-terminal 53-kDa fragment was analyzed for its N-terminal sequence using an automatic amino acid sequencer. Similarly, rSPN93-C and aMSP or aSAE were incubated, and N-terminal amino acid sequences of the released C-terminal fragments of rSPN93-C were determined. The heparin E2 fraction (5 μl) containing pro-MSP and pro-SPE, and the heparin E3 fraction (5 μl) containing GNBP3 and pro-SAE, pro-Spätzle (100 ng), and Ca2+ (10 mm) were used as described previously (16Kim C.H.

These components were incubated with either 2 μg of rSPN93-NC, rSPN93-N, or rSPN93-C for 5 min at 30 °C in the presence of β-1,3-glucan (100 ng). Each sample was separated using 15% SDS-PAGE, and pro-Spätzle (35 kDa) and processed Spätzle (12 kDa) were detected by Western blotting with anti-processed Spätzle antibody (1:100 diluted). Before injection of samples, larvae were cooled on ice, and 4 μl of sample solution was injected on the third and fourth ventral abdominal sternites using a narrow glass needle and a Picospritzer III (Parker). Three days after injection of dsRNA into larvae of T. molitor, larvae were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in a test tube. Total RNA was isolated from the whole bodies of larvae using TRIzol® solution. RNA was purified using chloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation and dissolved in nuclease-free water. The cDNA was generated using an AccuPower® RT PreMix kit (Bioneer, Dae-Jeon, Korea). Expression levels of the SPN93 gene and control ribosomal protein L-27A (RPL27a) gene were determined by normal PCR using the 93-RT-F/R and RPL27a-RT-F/R primers as shown in supplemental Table S1. The specific 300-bp region of SPN93 was amplified using dsRNA primers (supplemental Table S1), both of which had the promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase. Using the PCR product as a template, RNA was synthesized using an AmpliScribeTM T7-flashTM transcription kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Epicenter Biotechnologies, Madison, WI). Control RNA, a λDNA transcript, was synthesized using control template attached to the kit. The obtained RNA products were heated at 85 °C for 5 min and cooled to anneal them into dsRNA. The resulting dsRNA was extracted with a phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol solution, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and then dissolved using nuclease-free water. Four micrograms of dsRNA (for SPN93) or control RNA (4 μg/μl) was injected into fifth instar larvae of T. molitor. After 3 days of injection with dsRNA, silencing of target mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR, and dsRNA-treated larvae were injected with 600 ng of β-1,3-glucan per larva. The melanization and the survival of the larvae were monitored for 3 days. We screened a larval hemolymph factor of T. molitor that inhibits aSPE. Although we previously purified SPN48 that could inhibit aSPE in flow-through fractions of CM-Toyopearl column chromatography (20Jiang R. Kim E.H. Gong J.H. Kwon H.M. Kim C.H. Ryu K.H. Park J.W.

Chem. 2009; 284: 35652-35658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), specific eluate fractions of this column also inhibited the aSPE-mediated amidase activity, suggesting the existence of unidentified protease inhibitor(s). After performing several rounds of column chromatography (Fig. 1A), we found that a 93-kDa protein (lane 3 in Fig. 1C) co-migrated with the inhibitory activity toward the aSPE-mediated amidase (Fig. 1, B and C). To confirm whether or not the 93-kDa protein is a serpin, serpin-protease complex formation ability between the 93-kDa protein and 35-kDa aSPE was examined. When two proteins were incubated and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by visualization with CBB staining (Fig. 1D, left panel) or Western blotting using an anti-SPE antibody (right panel), the aSPE band was lost, and the amount of the 93-kDa protein decreased. In contrast, the 76-kDa band (indicated by arrows) containing aSPE appeared (Fig. 1D), providing the possibility of serpin-protease complex formation between the 93-kDa protein and aSPE after cleavage of 93-kDa protein. To confirm further whether or not the purified 93-kDa protein is a serpin, we have obtained the cDNA of the 93-kDa protein based on partially determined amino acid sequences (supplemental Fig. S1). The 93-kDa protein consists of 851 amino acids, including a 17-amino acid signal sequence at the N terminus and surprisingly contains two tandemly arrayed typical serpin domains (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). The N-terminal serpin domain, located from amino acids 41 to 403, has a putative cleavage site between Lys-371 and Phe-372, and the C-terminal serpin domain, located from amino acids 450 to 808, has a putative cleavage site between Leu-777 and Met-778. These results strongly support that the 76-kDa band appeared after incubation of the native 93-kDa protein with aSPE (Fig. 1D) is a serpin-protease covalent complex between the N-terminal serpin fragment (30 kDa) and aSPE (45 kDa). Also, the 76-kDa protein was assumed to be generated by the aSPE-mediated cleavage after the Lys-371 residue of the N-terminal serpin domain. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that the 93-kDa protein is a serpin protein (we named it SPN93). Having identified Tenebrio SPN93, we searched for twin-domain serpin orthologs from the genome sequence of another beetle, T. castaneum, but failed to find any annotated serpin genes in the correct size range (23Richards S.

Then, we searched a twin-domain serpin from a Tribolium cDNA library derived from the larval transcripts and identified Tribolium SPN93 (847 amino acids) with 79% amino acid identity with Tenebrio SPN93 (supplemental Fig. S1). As expected, RCL sequences of the twin-domain serpins of Tribolium SPN93 showed highly sequence identities with those of Tenebrio SPN93 (supplemental Fig. S1, red boxes), in particular, the putative cleavage sites (Lys-Phe and Leu-Met) are conserved between the two serpins. When orthologs of the two coleopteran SPN93s were further searched using BLAST within the human, dog, wasp, pea aphid, and mosquito genomes, five twin-domain serpins of ∼780 to 1,000 amino acids in length were found (supplemental Fig. S2). These two-domain serpins were annotated via automated computational analysis. The N-terminal and C-terminal RCL domains of these sequences showed high conservancy with those of the coleopteran SPN93s. For example, an Arg or Lys residue (except for Ser in dog) and a Leu or Pro residue (except for Arg in dog) were predicted as putative cleavage sites of the N-terminal and C-terminal RCL domains, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3). These similarities suggest that all seven twin-domain serpins may have similar biochemical properties. However, the biochemical properties and biological functions of these large serpins are still unsolved because the native or recombinant proteins have not been purified to homogeneity yet. To determine further the biochemical properties of Tenebrio SPN93, the recombinant SPN93 (rSPN93-NC), N-terminal domain of SPN93 (rSPN93-N), C-terminal domain (rSPN93-C), and N-terminal domain containing a cleavage site mutation (rSPN93-N-K371Q, Lys-371 was replaced with Gln) were expressed (Fig. 2B). As shown in the native SPN93, the amidase activity of aSPE was inhibited when purified recombinant SPN93NC was incubated with aSPE (Fig. 2C, colu"
https://openalex.org/W2018591832,"The c-Jun transcription factor is a highly unstable oncoprotein. Several ubiquitin ligases mediate c-Jun degradation. However, c-Jun can be stabilized once it is phosphorylated at the N-terminus by c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) or other protein kinases. This phosphorylation decreases c-Jun ubiquitination and degradation. The underlying mechanism for this phenomenon is still unknown. Here, we show that receptor for activated C-kinase 1 (Rack1) can bind with c-Jun and ubiquitin ligase Fbw7 to form a complex. When c-Jun is phosphorylated at the N-terminus, c-Jun is released from the complex and cannot be ubiquitinated by Fbw7, which leads to increased stabilization and accumulation of c-Jun. These results reveal that Rack1 has a very important role in tumorigenesis by maintaining the stability of c-Jun that has been phosphorylated at its N-terminus by JNKs or other kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2091784495,"Dendritic cell (DC)-mediated presentation of MHC class I (MHC-I)/peptide complexes is a crucial first step in the priming of CTL responses, and the cytoplasmic tail of MHC-I plays an important role in modulating this process. Several species express a splice variant of the MHC-I tail that deletes exon 7-encoding amino acids (Δ7), including a conserved serine phosphorylation site. Previously, it has been shown that Δ7 MHC-I molecules demonstrate extended DC surface half-lives, and that mice expressing Δ7-Kb generate significantly augmented CTL responses to viral challenge. Herein, we show that Δ7-Db-expressing DCs stimulated significantly more proliferation and much higher cytokine secretion by melanoma antigen-specific (Pmel-1) T cells. Moreover, in combination with adoptive Pmel-1 T-cell transfer, Δ7-Db DCs were superior to WT-Db DCs at stimulating anti-tumor responses against established B16 melanoma tumors, significantly extending mouse survival. Human DCs engineered to express Δ7-HLA-A*0201 showed similarly enhanced CTL stimulatory capacity. Further studies demonstrated impaired lateral membrane movement and clustering of human Δ7-MHC-I/peptide complexes, resulting in significantly increased bioavailability of MHC-I/peptide complexes for specific CD8+ T cells. Collectively, these data suggest that targeting exon 7-encoded MHC-I cytoplasmic determinants in DC vaccines has the potential to increase CD8+ T-cell stimulatory capacity and substantially improve their clinical efficacy."

RyR1 is composed of a homotetramer of an ∼565-kDa subunit. A large N-terminal cytoplasmic domain constitutes the “foot” structure that spans the junctional gap between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and transverse tubule, whereas a small C-terminal domain contains the transmembrane segments that form an ion-conducting pore (3Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In excitation-contraction coupling, RyR1 is activated by a conformational change of the voltage sensor in the dihydropyridine receptor upon depolarization of the transverse tubule membrane, which is referred to as the depolarization-induced Ca2+ release (4Ríos E.

The S4-S5 linker is a cytoplasmic loop connecting the S4 and S5 transmembrane segments in six transmembrane-type channels.

The importance of the S4-S5 linker has also been reported in many other channels (11Kuo A. Domene C. Johnson L.N. Doyle D.A. Vénien-Bryan C.

Substantial similarity in organization of the transmembrane segments between RyR1 and Kv1.2 raises the hypothesis that the S4-S5 linker is involved in RyR1 channel gating (17Samsó M. Feng W. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e85Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis, we performed alanine substitution scan of the N-terminal half of the putative S4-S5 linker (Thr4825–Ser4829) that exhibits high helix probability by determining the CICR activity in vivo and in vitro. The mutant RyR1 channels exhibited an increased or decreased CICR activity by various levels. The impact of each mutant on channel activity can be rationalized by the linker forming an α-helical structure. These findings suggest that the N-terminal half of the S4-S5 linker may form an α-helical structure and play an important role in RyR1 channel gating. Cloning and construction of the full-length cDNA cassette encoding the rabbit skeletal muscle RyR1 (pBS-RyR1) has been described previously (18Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S.

The RyR1 cDNA was inserted into pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen), a tetracycline-inducible mammalian expression vector. A 0.8-kb 5′-fragment of the cDNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GCAAGCTTCGCCACCATGGGTGACGGAGGAGAGGGC-3′ (HindIII site is underlined) and 5′-CAGGTACCGTCCGGTGGTGACATG-3′ (KpnI site is underlined) and subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO using the HindIII and KpnI sites. The remaining 14.4-kb 3′-fragment was subcloned into the above plasmid with KpnI and EcoRV sites to generate pcDNA5/FRT/TO-RyR1. Each mutation in the S4-S5 linker corresponding to T4825A, T4825I, I4826A, L4827A, S4828A, and S4829A, was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the ClaI (14478)-EcoRV (15248) fragment (pBS-RyR1cs11) as the PCR template (18Tong J.

The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated fragment was subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO-RyR1 using the ClaI and EcoRV sites. Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mm l-glutamine. The stable inducible cell lines were generated by co-transfection of the WT or mutant pcDNA5/FRT/TO-RyR1 vector with the pOG44 vector encoding Flp recombinase according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were replated 1 day after transfection, and the growth medium was replaced with selective medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin. The selective medium was changed every 3 days until the hygromycin-resistant foci were identified. Several hygromycin-resistant foci were tested for the inducible expression of RyR1, and the selected clones were expanded and stored in liquid nitrogen. Intracellular Ca2+ transients in HEK293 cells expressing WT and mutant RyR1 channels were measured by single-cell Ca2+ imaging using fura-2 (23Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2011; 105: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were plated on the collagen-coated glass-bottomed dishes, and protein expression was induced by doxycycline (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. The cells were loaded with 5 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM without FCS and washed with a bath solution (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 11 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The dish was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope, and fura-2 fluorescence was monitored by a fluorescent monitoring system (Hamamatsu Photonics) with wavelength settings of 340 and 380 nm for excitation (alternating) and 510 nm for emission. Caffeine (0.3–30 mm) was dissolved in the bath solution and perfused into the dishes by suction. Because high concentrations of caffeine affects fura-2 fluorescence intensity to decrease ratio signals (F340/F380) (24Muschol M. Dasgupta B.R. Salzberg B.M. Biophysical journal. 1999; 77: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), magnitude of Ca2+ signals at 10 and 30 mm caffeine were corrected for caffeine effect by multiplying the value by a factor of 1.2 (10 mm caffeine) or 1.6 (30 mm caffeine). Stable HEK293 cells were plated onto ten 100-mm tissue culture dishes and protein expression was induced by doxycycline (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. The cells were harvested, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in a homogenization buffer (0.3 m sucrose and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and a protease inhibitor mixture). The cells were disrupted by N2 cavitation after equilibration in N2 for 15 min at 1000 psi. The microsomes were obtained by differential centrifugation (1000–100,000 × g) and resuspended in the above buffer. The microsomes were quickly frozen using liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until use. Single-channel recordings were carried out as described previously with CHAPS-solubilized microsomal protein as the material (19Oba T. Maeno Y. Am. J. Physiol.

Channel currents were recorded in symmetrical solutions of 250 mm cesium methanesulfonate and 20 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 6.8, at the holding potential of −40 mV (cis). Experiments were carried out at 18–22 °C. Bilayers containing only a single channel were used for analysis. Channel currents amplified by an Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments) were filtered at 1 kHz using an eight-pole low pass Bessel filter and collected at 5 kHz for analysis. The mean open probability (Po) was calculated from recording durations >2 min by 50% threshold analysis using the pClamp software (version 6.0.4). Ca2+-dependent [3H]ryanodine binding was carried out as described previously (20Murayama T. Oba T. Hara H. Wakebe K. Ikemoto N. Ogawa Y. Biochem.

Briefly, the microsomes (50–100 μg of protein) were incubated with 8.5 nm [3H]ryanodine for 5 h at 25 °C in a 100-μl solution containing 0.17 m NaCl, 20 mm 3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid, pH 6.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm β,γ-methylene adenosine triphosphate (AMPPCP) and various concentrations of free Ca2+. The ionic strength of the solution was kept constant in whole pCa (−log [free Ca2+]) range by using 10 mm Ca-EGTA buffer. The protein-bound [3H]ryanodine was separated by filtering through polyethyleneimine-treated glass filters (Whatman GF/B). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled ryanodine. The [3H]ryanodine binding data (B) were normalized to the maximal binding sites for [3H]ryanodine (Bmax), which was separately determined by Scatchard plot analysis using varied concentrations of [3H]ryanodine (3–40 nm). The B/Bmax represents an averaged activity of individual channels and can be compared quantitatively between mutants (20Murayama T. Oba T. Hara H. Wakebe K. Ikemoto N. Ogawa Y. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Murayama T. Oba T. Kobayashi S. Ikemoto N. Ogawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C1222-C1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). EC50 for Ca2+ activation and IC50 for Ca2+ inactivation were calculated by curve-fitting of the Ca2+-dependent [3H]ryanodine binding data as described previously (22Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1810-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons have been made using GraphPad Prism5 software. Student's t test was used to compare two groups. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Fig. 1A shows a schematic drawing of the transmembrane topology of the RyR1 channel based on the model according to Du et al. (15Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The S4-S5 linker is a cytoplasmic loop connecting the S4 and S5 segments. This loop is predicted to be 10 residues in length (Thr4825–Gly4834) (15Du G.G. Sandhu B. Khanna V.K. Guo X.H. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16725-16730Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The helix probability analysis indicates that its N-terminal half (Thr4825–Ser4829) exhibits high helix probability (Fig. 1B) (25Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Exp. Mol. Med. 2007; 39: 594-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the voltage-gated potassium channels, formation of an α-helical structure of the S4-S5 linker is critical for channel gating (9Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar, 10Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). We therefore performed alanine substitution scan of the amino acid residues in the N-terminal half of the putative S4-S5 linker (Thr4825–Ser4829). The WT and mutant RyR1 constructs were expressed in HEK cells using a tetracycline-inducible expression system (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2A shows Western blotting of the lysate from these cells. The anti-RyR antibody detected a protein band for a high molecular mass species (565 kDa) in all the cells. No positive bands were observed in mock-transfected cells (data not shown). Besides L4827A, the intensity of the RyR1 band was similar between the mutants, indicating that the levels of protein expression were similar. Fig. 2B shows the localization of the mutant RyR1s in HEK cells. As observed for WT, all of the mutants exhibited a mesh-like pattern, indicating endoplasmic reticulum localization of the expressed RyR1. Consistent with the Western blots, the fluorescence intensity of L4827A was lower than that of WT or the other mutants, indicating low levels of expression of this mutant. The mutant RyR1 channel was assessed by CICR activity. We initially determined the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients in HEK cells (Fig. 3). Caffeine is a potent activator of CICR and caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients well reflect the CICR activity in vivo (18Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). No or only small Ca2+ transients were observed with mock-transfected cells with caffeine, indicating negligible level of endogenous RyRs (Fig. 3A). Cells expressing WT exhibited caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients in a dose-dependent manner: the Ca2+ transients increased as the caffeine concentration increased. This is consistent with the previous reports with HEK cells expressing RyR1 (18Tong J. Oyamada H. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. McCarthy T.V. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26332-26339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The observed decrease in the Ca2+ transients at caffeine concentrations ≥10 mm may be due to the direct effect of caffeine on the fura-2 ratio signals (24Muschol M. Dasgupta B.R. Salzberg B.M. Biophysical journal. 1999; 77: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine caffeine sensitivity, the peak magnitude of Ca2+ transients was plotted against the caffeine concentration after correction for the caffeine effect (Fig. 3B). All of the alanine-substituted mutants except for L4827A exhibited a reduction in the caffeine sensitivity (Fig. 3A). For T4825A, no Ca2+ release was observed at 1 mm caffeine, and only small responses were observed at 3 mm caffeine. The effect was more profound for S4829A but less obvious for I4826A and S4828A. The rank order of caffeine sensitivity was WT > I4826A ≒ S4828A > T4825A > S4829A (Fig. 3B). The peak magnitude of Ca2+ transients (Fig. 3B) and the resting Ca2+ level (Fig. 3C) for these mutants were similar when compared with the WT species. L4827A exhibited small but significant Ca2+ release at caffeine concentrations ≥1 mm (Fig. 3A). The peak magnitude of L4827A was one seventh of that of the WT (Fig. 3B). The resting Ca2+ level was significantly higher for L4827 than that for WT or the other mutants (Fig. 3C). These findings can well be explained by the idea that L4827A constitutes a leaky channel in HEK cells under resting conditions. We next recorded the single-channel currents of the mutant RyRs that had been incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Cs+ was used for the current carrier instead of Ca2+ because conductance for Cs+ was much greater than that for Ca2+ (26Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). The cis-free Ca2+ was set at 0.1 mm to optimally activate the channel. The alanine-substituted mutants except for L4827A exhibited lower open probability (Po) than WT in varied extents (Fig. 4A): T4825A and S4829A exhibited a severely reduced Po when compared with the WT channel, whereas the reduction in Po was moderate for I4826A and negligible for S4828A. The rank order of mean open probability was WT > S4828A > I4826A > T4825A > S4829A (Fig. 4B). No alteration of channel conductance was observed between WT and mutant RyR1 channels (Fig. 4C). These findings suggest that these mutant channels have reduced channel opening without alteration of pore formation. The L4827A channel exhibited a much higher Po than WT (Fig. 4, A and B). Possible subconductance states of about one-fourth and three-fourths of the full conductance level were also seen (Fig. 4A). The full open conductance of the mutant channel was not different from that of WT (Fig. 4C). Notably, high activity (Po = 0.55 ± 0.09, n = 6) was also observed even at low Ca2+ levels (15 mm) (data not shown). Thus, the L4827A mutant constitutes a hyperactive channel. The CICR activity of the mutant channels was further investigated by [3H]ryanodine binding. Because ryanodine only binds to the open channel, ryanodine binding is widely used as an index of CICR activity (1Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 2Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The WT RyR1 exhibited biphasic Ca2+-dependent [3H]ryanodine binding with the peak magnitude at 30 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 5A). The Ca2+ concentrations for half-maximal activation (EC50) and inactivation (IC50) for WT were 3.7 ± 0.3 μm and 0.15 ± 0.01 mm, respectively (Fig. 5, C and D). The biphasic Ca2+ dependence is explained by the presence of two distinct Ca2+ sites: a high affinity (KD ∼ μm) activating site (A site) and a low affinity (KD ∼ sub-mm) inactivating site (I site). The binding of Ca2+ to the A site makes the channel available for activation, whereas the binding of Ca2+ to the I site inactivates the channel (22Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1810-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, magnitude of the Ca2+-dependent activity is determined by another parameter, Amax, which represents the gain of the CICR activity (22Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1810-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2011; 105: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All of the alanine-substituted mutants except for L4827A demonstrated reduced magnitude of ryanodine binding (Fig. 5A). The EC50 and the IC50 values of the mutants for Ca2+ were not substantially different from those of WT, indicating no alterations in Ca2+ sensitivity (Fig. 5, C and D). Furthermore, caffeine increased the ryanodine binding to WT and the mutants in a similar dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5E). These findings suggest that lower CICR activity of the mutant channels is primarily caused by a reduced gain. The rank order of the peak magnitude was WT > S4828A > I4826A > T4825A > S4829A. This is in accordance with the rank order of caffeine sensitivity in caffeine-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 3) and of Po in the single-channel recordings (Fig. 4). L4827A exhibited high [3H]ryanodine binding in a broad range of Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 5B). Substantial [3H]ryanodine binding was observed even in the absence of Ca2+ (10 mm EGTA with no added Ca2+). The mutant was less sensitive to inactivating Ca2+ (Fig. 5D) and CICR inhibitors, including Mg2+, procaine, and ruthenium red (Fig. 5F). Consequently, L4827A may represent a constitutively active channel. This well explains that the mutant forms a leaky channel under resting conditions in HEK cells (Fig. 3). T4825I is a disease-associated mutation for malignant hyperthermia (27Brown R.L. Pollock A.N. Couchman K.G. Hodges M. Hutchinson D.O. Waaka R. Lynch P. McCarthy T.V. Stowell K.M. Hum Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1515-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and is shown to enhance the CICR channel activity (28Yang T. Ta T.A. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25722-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the role of the S4-S5 linker, we investigated the T4825I mutant using the above methods under the same conditions. HEK cells expressing T4825I showed higher caffeine sensitivity in caffeine-induced Ca2+ release without substantial changes in the peak magnitude and resting Ca2+ level (Fig. 3). In single channel recordings, the T4825I channel exhibited a higher Po than the WT channel (Fig. 4). Possible subconductance states were also seen. Ca2+-dependent [3H]ryanodine binding demonstrated that T4825I had a 5-fold higher peak magnitude than WT with enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity for activation and reduced Ca2+ sensitivity for inactivation (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results indicate that the T4825I mutation makes the CICR active by both increasing the gain of the channel and altering the Ca2+ dependence. This is in marked contrast to the results of the alanine-substituted mutant at the corresponding site (T4825A) showing markedly reduced activity. In this study, we investigated the role of the amino acid residues in the N-terminal half of the putative S4-S5 linker in the RyR1 channel gating using an alanine substitution scan. The CICR activity of the alanine-substituted mutants were determined in vivo and in vitro by caffeine-induced Ca2+ release, single-channel recordings, and [3H]ryanodine binding. We found that four of five mutants (T4825A, I4826A, S4828A, and S4829A) exhibited reduced CICR activity without substantially changing the single-channel conductance and Ca2+ or caffeine sensitivity. These findings support the hypothesis that the N-terminal half of the S4-S5 linker may control the gate of the RyR1 channel. The impact of the alanine substitutions was stronger for the T4825A and S4829A mutations, but lower for the I4826A and S4828A mutations. Fig. 6 demonstrates an α-helical wheel representation of the region from Lys4821 to Val4830, which exhibits high helix probability (see Fig. 1B). There are two clear faces: polar and basic residues cluster on one face and hydrophobic residues are present on the opposite face. Thr4825 and Ser4829 are located close to each other and on one face of the helix. Ile4826 and Ser4828 are not proximal to these two residues. The distribution can explain the varied effects of the alanine substitutions on activity: the face around Thr4825 and Ser4829 is more important in channel gating than the regions around Ile4826 and Ser4828. The L4827A mutant, in contrast, constituted a leaky channel in vivo. The mutant channel exhibited greater Po than WT with occurrence of possible subconductance states. L4827A had a high activity even in the absence of Ca2+ and was much less sensitive to the CICR inhibitors. These findings suggest that L4827A forms a constitutively active channel probably by dysregulation of channel gating. On the α-helical wheel representation, Leu4827 is located on the opposite side of Thr4825 and Ser4829 and forms a hydrophobic cluster with Leu4823, Val4830, and Ile4826. Such a difference might be related to the different effects of the alanine substitutions. I4826A exhibited a slightly reduced CICR activity in contrast to L4827A. This might be explained by location of the residue. The face around Leu4827 is more critical in channel gating than the region around Ile4826. Recently, an MH mutation (L4823P) has been reported in Leu4823 (29Sei Y. Sambuughin N.N. Davis E.J. Sachs D. Cuenca P.B. Brandom B.W. Tautz T. Rosenberg H. Nelson T.E. Muldoon S.M. Anesthesiology. 2004; 101: 824-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Shepherd S. Ellis F. Halsall J. Hopkins P. Robinson R. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A detailed investigation of the MH mutant and alanine-substituted mutants for Leu4823 and Val4830 would provide further support for the role of the hydrophobic cluster. An MH-associated mutation, T4825I, exhibited enhanced activity when compared with WT, which is consistent with a previous report (28Yang T. Ta T.A. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25722-25730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The phenotype of T4825I was opposite to the alanine-substituted mutant (T4825A), which showed markedly reduced activity. This observation raises the question of why the two mutations had opposite effects on channel activity. Isoleucine has a larger side chain (-CH(CH3)CH2CH3) than alanine (-CH3). The side chain of threonine has an intermediate size (-CH2(CH3)OH). Thus, the size of the side chain at position 4825 might be important in the function of the S4-S5 linker. How does the S4-S5 linker control the gate in the RyR1 channel? Hamada et al. (31Hamada T. Bannister M.L. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4272-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the S4-S5 linker interacts with a 96-kDa fragment of RyR1 containing a calmodulin-like domain (residues 4064–4210). Lee and Allen (25Lee E.H. Allen P.D. Exp. Mol. Med. 2007; 39: 594-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) showed that the S4-S5 linker interacts with the C-terminal tail fragment (residues 4938–5037). It is quite possible that the S4-S5 linker interacts with multiple domains to mediate signal transmission from ligand binding to pore opening. Because serine and threonine residues can undergo phosphorylation, it is reasonably hypothesized that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of these residues (Thr4825, Ser4828, and Ser4829) may contribute to channel gating. No consensus sequences, however, are found within the S4-S5 linker for potential phosphorylation sites by protein kinase A, PKC, and CaM kinase II (32Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the S4-S5 linker is localized close to the membrane and predicted to interact with the other domains in such restricted space. This might result in a reduced accessibility of kinases/phosphatases. Thus, phosphorylation of these residues seems unlikely. The amino acid sequence of the putative S4-S5 linker is highly conserved among RyR isoforms: all 10 residues are identical in vertebrate RyR1–3 (1Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 2Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This suggests that the regulatory mechanism of channel gating via the S4-S5 linker may be shared between the RyR isoforms. Analysis of the RyR2 and RyR3 channels carrying mutations at the corresponding residues would provide further support. High sequence conservation of the S4-S5 linker also raises a possibility of the importance of its C-terminal half. The fact that a disease-associated mutation (H4762P) for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia has been found within the C-terminal half of the S4-S5 linker in RyR2 may support the possibility (33George C.H. Jundi H. Thomas N.L. Fry D.L. Lai F.A. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2007; 42: 34-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results strongly support the idea that the N-terminal half of the putative S4-S5 linker plays an important role in the RyR1 channel gating by forming α-helical structure. Further structural and mutational analyses will facilitate our understanding of the interaction and regulatory mechanisms via the S4-S5 linker."
https://openalex.org/W2057469773,"Growing evidence suggests that transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3 may play an important regulatory role during inflammation. However, the function of Stat3 in acute lung injury (ALI) is largely unknown. In the current study, by using an adenoviral vector expressing a dominant-negative Stat3 isoform (Ad-Stat3-EVA), we determined the role of Stat3 in IgG immune complex (IC)-induced inflammatory responses and injury in the lung from C57BL/6J mice. We show that IgG IC-induced DNA binding activity of Stat3 in the lung was significantly inhibited by Stat3-EVA. We demonstrate that both lung vascular permeability (albumin leak) and lung myeloperoxidase accumulation in the Ad-Stat-EVA treated mice were substantially reduced when compared with values in mice receiving control virus (Ad-GFP) during the injury. Furthermore, intratracheal administration of Ad-Stat3-EVA caused significant decreases in the contents of neutrophils, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), chemokines [keratinocyte cell-derived chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and MIP-1β], and complement component C5a in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Using Stat3-specific small interfering RNA, we show that knocking down Stat3 expression in alveolar macrophages (MH-S cells) significantly reduced the production of proinflammatory mediators on IgG IC stimulation. These data suggest that Stat3 plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of IgG IC-induced ALI by mediating the acute inflammatory responses in the lung and alveolar macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2016950049,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is highly expressed at sites of nerve-muscle contact where it is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying its regulation is incomplete, but they appear to involve both translational and post-translational events as well. Here, we show that Pumilio-2 (PUM2), an RNA binding translational repressor, is highly localized at the neuromuscular junction where AChE mRNA concentrates. Immunoprecipitation of muscle cell extracts with a PUM2 specific antibody precipitated AChE mRNA, suggesting that PUM2 binds to the AChE transcripts in a complex. Gel shift assays using a bacterially expressed PUM2 RNA binding domain showed specific binding using wild type AChE 3'-UTR RNA segment that was abrogated by mutation of the consensus recognition site. Transfecting skeletal muscle cells with shRNAs specific for PUM2 up-regulated AChE expression, whereas overexpression of PUM2 decreased AChE activity. We conclude that PUM2 binds to AChE mRNA and regulates AChE expression translationally at the neuromuscular synapse. Finally, we found that PUM2 is regulated by the motor nerve suggesting a trans-synaptic mechanism for locally regulating translation of specific proteins involved in modulating synaptic transmission, analogous to CNS synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2012575446,"The DREAM complex is an important regulator of mitotic gene expression during the cell cycle. Here we report that inactivation of LIN9, a subunit of DREAM, results in premature senescence, which can be overcome by the SV40 large T (LT) antigen. Together with the observation that p16INK4a and p21Waf1 are upregulated upon loss of LIN9, these results indicate that senescence is triggered by the pRB and p53 tumor suppressor pathways. We also find that LIN9-null cells that escape senescence are chromosomally instable because of compromised mitotic fidelity. SV40 LT-expressing cells that adapt to the loss of LIN9 can grow anchorage-independently in soft agar, a hallmark of oncogenic transformation. Taken together, these results suggest an important role of mitotic gene regulation in the maintenance of genomic stability and tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2062689845,"Factor B is a zymogen that carries the catalytic site of the complement alternative pathway C3 convertase. During convertase assembly, factor B associates with C3b and Mg2+ forming a pro-convertase C3bB(Mg2+) that is cleaved at a single factor B site by factor D. In free factor B, a pair of salt bridges binds the Arg234 side chain to Glu446 and to Glu207, forming a double latch structure that sequesters the scissile bond (between Arg234 and Lys235) and minimizes its unproductive cleavage. It is unknown how the double latch is released in the pro-convertase. Here, we introduce single amino acid substitutions into factor B that preclude one or both of the Arg234 salt bridges, and we examine their impact on several different pro-convertase complexes. Our results indicate that loss of the Arg234-Glu446 salt bridge partially stabilizes C3bB(Mg2+). Loss of the Arg234-Glu207 salt bridge has lesser effects. We propose that when factor B first associates with C3b, it bears two intact Arg234 salt bridges. The complex rapidly dissociates unless the Arg234-Glu446 salt bridge is released whereupon conformational changes occur that activate the metal ion-dependent adhesion site and partially stabilize the complex.

Complement marks microbial pathogens for opsonization and clearance or for lysis and plays a key role in the identification and removal of damaged tissue and other potentially dangerous biological debris (1Ricklin D.

Factor B binds to C3b in the presence of Mg2+, forming a transient complex (t½ ∼5 s) (10Harris C.L. Abbott R.J. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. J. Biol.

Surg. 2006; 19: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). During this process a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) is formed at the apex of the VWA domain and mediates Mg2+-dependent C3b binding, and an exosite is formed at the VWA-serine protease domain interface and mediates factor D binding (14Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In free factor B, a pair of salt bridges connects the Arg234 side chain to Glu207 of the linker region and Glu446 of the VWA domain in a “locked” conformation (Fig. 1, B and C) (15Milder F.J. Gomes L. Schouten A. Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Romijn R.A. Hemrika W. Roos A. Daha M.R. Gros P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The salt bridges sequester the scissile bond (between Arg234 and Lys235) and prevent unproductive cleavage of factor B by circulating serine proteases (16Taylor F.R. Bixler S.A. Budman J.I. Wen D. Karpusas M. Ryan S.T. Jaworski G.J. Safari-Fard A. Pollard S. Whitty A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2849-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is not known how the double latch structure is opened to permit factor D cleavage of the scissile bond in the short lived C3bB(Mg2+) complex. Here, we characterize the properties of factor B mutations that preclude one or both of the Arg234 salt bridges. We examine their effects on the assembly and stability of the pro-convertase C3bB(Mg2+). Our analyses indicate that the release of the Arg234 salt bridges partially stabilizes the C3bB(Mg2+) complex and that this effect is due predominantly to loss of the Arg234-Glu446 bond. This result was greatly diminished in the case of CVFB(Mg2+), a pro-convertase that incorporates the C3b homolog cobra venom factor (CVF) in place of C3b and is 100-fold less sensitive to factor D than is C3bB(Mg2+) (17Janssen B.J.

It was also absent in the case of C3bB(Ni2+), a pro-convertase in which the salt bridges are spontaneously released. From our observations we propose a specific order of molecular events that accounts for the release of the Arg234 salt bridges, formation of the MIDAS and factor D exosite, and the cleavage of the scissile bond by factor D during the assembly of the AP convertase. Purified native complement proteins (human C3b, CVF, factor B, factor D) and antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes were obtained from CompTech, Tyler, TX. N-Hydroxysuccinimide, EDAC, and ethanolamine solutions were purchased from GE Healthcare and stored at −20 °C. Recombinant factor B proteins were produced with a previously described factor B cDNA cloned in pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) expression vector (18Hourcade D.E. Wagner L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19716-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the cDNA sequence by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). Some multiple mutations were constructed using previously reported single and double mutations. Human 293T kidney cells were transfected in serum-free medium utilizing Opti-MEM (Invitrogen catalog no. 31985-070) supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine. Cell supernatants were collected, treated with benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences catalog no. 17-5123-10) to remove nonspecific proteases, and dialyzed and stored in phosphate buffer (11 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with 25 mm NaCl. Recombinant factor B was quantitated by ELISA with mouse anti-human Ba mAb (Quidel, San Diego, CA) for capture and goat anti-human factor B polyclonal antibody (catalog no. 80264; Diasorin, Stillwater, MN) for detection. Recombinant proteins were quantified by ELISA and examined by Western blotting. A factor B-dependent hemolysis assay (18Hourcade D.E. Wagner L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Biol.

We have numbered the factor B residues based on the amino acid sequence of the mature protein (9Mole J.E. Anderson J.K. Davison E.A. Woods D.E. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 2906-2911PubMed Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) methodology was conducted with a BIAcore 2000 instrument using the manufacturer's software package (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ). CM5 sensor chips (BIAcore catalog no. BR-1000-14) were used throughout with Mg2+-HEPES running buffer (filtered and degassed 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4). In some cases MgCl2 was replaced with 2 mm NiCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, or 3 mm EDTA. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Biosensor flow paths were activated with a fresh 1:1 mixture of 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.2 m EDAC injected at 5 μl/min for 7 min. C3b ligand was then covalently attached to the activated surface: C3b or CVF was dissolved in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 4.8, at 10 μg/ml and injected in the experimental flow path, at 10 μl/min for 90 s to 3 min. The flow path was then “blocked” by treatment with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, at 5 μl/min for 7 min. A reference flow path was produced as above but without C3b in the citrate buffer. Various combinations of native or mutant factor B or native factor D in running buffer were injected at 30 μl/min for varying times using the KINJECT command. Changes in response units, indicative of changes in mass bound to the biosensor surface, were expressed as the difference between the ligand-treated and reference flow paths. Mutant factor B cell supernatant preparations were dialyzed with running buffer before use. Residual C3bB and CVFB complexes were dissociated with EDTA HEPES buffer. Kinetic analyses were performed using the Biaevaluation software package. Kinetic analysis of native plasma-derived factor B yielded a two-state conformational change model similar to those obtained by Harris et al. (10Harris C.L. Abbott R.J. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P.

Open table in a new tab The factor B Arg234 salt bridges protect the scissile bond and so must be broken to permit factor D cleavage (Fig. 1C). In this study we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate factor B proteins that lack either one or both salt bridges to characterize the C3bB complexes that form without them. Mutations were introduced in a previously described factor B cDNA, and recombinant proteins were produced by transient transfection of human 293T kidney cells. Recombinant proteins were quantified by ELISA and examined further by Western blot analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). We first examined mutations that replace the Arg234 residue, thus precluding both protective salt bridges and also altering the factor D cleavage site, producing hemolytically inactive proteins. Purified C3b was bound to a biosensor surface and subsequently treated in the presence of Mg2+ with a factor B single amino acid substitution, R234A. As shown in Fig. 2A, R234A increased C3b binding up to 10-fold compared with wild-type native and recombinant factor B. The resulting C3bB(Mg2+) complexes rapidly dissociated in the presence of EDTA (data not shown), characteristic of wild-type C3bB(Mg2+) but not of C3bBb(Mg2+) (10Harris C.L. Abbott R.J. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2569-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Xu Y. Narayana S.V. Volanakis J.E. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Greater than 5-fold increases in C3b binding were observed with the single amino acid substitution R234N and with 233AAA, a substitution that replaces three amino acids at the cleavage site (K233A/R234A/K235A) (19Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2906-2911PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). We next examined the effects of amino acid substitutions which preclude one Arg234 salt bridge at a time. Two mutations were selected: E207A (removing the side chain joining Arg234 to the linker region) and E446V (removing the side chain joining Arg234 to the VWA domain) (see Fig. 1C). Both mutant proteins were hemolytically active and in that respect not statistically different from the wild-type recombinant protein (E446V, 67 ± 10% of wild type; E207A, 104 ± 30% of wild type; n = 5). Using the SPR methodology, we compared the C3b binding activity of E207A and of E446V with the R234A substitution and with wild-type factor B. The E446V mutation resulted in accentuated Mg2+-dependent C3b binding similar to the R234A substitution (Fig. 2C). The effect was much less prominent in the case of E207A. Further insight was obtained through a detailed kinetic analysis of the two mutants and their wild-type recombinant parent (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Interaction of all three proteins with the C3b ligand in the presence of Mg2+ best conformed to a two-state conformational change model, as reported previously by Harris et al. for factor B derived from human plasma (10Harris C.L. Abbott R.J. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2569-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Wild-type recombinant factor B had the lowest affinity for C3b (KD = 73 nm), E207A somewhat greater affinity for C3b (KD = 46 nm), and E446V had the greatest affinity for C3b (KD = 16 nm). These differences in affinity were mainly due to differences in C3bB stability: C3bB complex that incorporated recombinant wild-type factor B was least stable (koff1 = 0.135 s−1; t½ ∼5 s), those that incorporated E207A were about 50% more stable than wild type (koff1 = 0.090 s−1; t½ ∼8 s), and those that incorporated E446V were 8-fold more stable than wild type (koff1 = 0.016 s−1; t½ ∼43 s). Previous studies by Forneris et al. have established that in the pro-convertase complex, an essential factor D-binding site (exosite), is formed between the VWA and serine protease domains when the two factor B Arg234 salt bridges are released (14Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The exosite can be readily detected by SPR analysis if the factor B D254G/N260D double gain-of-function mutation is used to stabilize C3bB(Mg2+) on the biosensor and factor D cleavage is inhibited (14Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We combined the D254G/N260D factor B mutations with the 233AAA mutation that precludes both salt bridges and confers factor D resistance. We pretreated C3b that had been bound to a biosensor surface with the mutant factor B protein in the presence of Mg2+, forming a stable C3bB(Mg2+) complex (Fig. 4A). We then treated the resulting C3bB(Mg2+) complexes with various concentrations of factor D. Factor D bound readily to the C3bB(Mg2+) complexes (Fig. 4 and Table 1). We conclude that whether the Arg234 salt bridges are released during convertase assembly or precluded by mutation, a functional factor D exosite can form. Rodriguez de Cordoba and his collaborators have examined C3bB complexes using single particle electron microscopy (EM) (21Torreira E. Tortajada A. Montes T. Rodríguez de Córdoba S. Llorca O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Torreira E. Tortajada A. Montes T. Rodríguez de Córdoba S. Llorca O. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 7347-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Two C3bB complexes were chosen for their analysis based on added stability: C3BD234G(Mg2+), incorporating the factor B D254G gain-of-function mutation (19Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2906-2911PubMed Google Scholar), and C3B(Ni2+) (23Fishelson Z. Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7411-7415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two C3bB conformations in apparent equilibrium were described: a “closed” conformation in which the Arg234 salt bridges are intact and an “open” conformation in which the Arg234 salt bridges are released. In the case of C3BD234G(Mg2+), 35% of the complexes were in the closed conformation (22Torreira E. Tortajada A. Montes T. Rodríguez de Córdoba S. Llorca O. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 7347-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the case of C3bB(Ni2+), only 2% of the complexes were closed (21Torreira E. Tortajada A. Montes T. Rodríguez de Córdoba S. Llorca O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). From these observations we expected that the introduction of either the R234A or E446V mutation with the D234G mutation would increase factor B affinity for C3b by promoting open conformations at the expense of closed conformations. To test this prediction we constructed a series of double mutants: R234A/D254G, E446V/D254G, and E207A/D254G. We then compared the double mutants with the D254G parent (Fig. 5A). The double R234A and E446V mutations resulted in higher affinity for C3b, consistent with our view. However, we did not expect that R234A or E446V would increase the affinity of factor B for C3b in the presence of Ni2+ because the EM study shows that C3bB(Ni2+) complexes are nearly all open conformations already. Consistent with this prediction, the E446V diminished C3b binding slightly in the presence of Ni2+ (compare Fig. 5, B and C). CVF is a C3b homolog that forms an active C3 convertase in concert with factor B, factor D, and divalent cation, CVFBb(Mg2+) (17Janssen B.J. Gomes L. Koning R.I. Svergun D.I. Koster A.J. Fritzinger D.C. Vogel C.W. Gros P. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2469-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CVF is known to bind to factor B with higher affinity than C3b and to produce a highly stable active CVFBb(Mg2+) complex (t½ ∼7 h) (24Vogel C.W. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8292-8299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of factor B in complex with CVF, CVFB(Mg2+), is regarded as a model for the C3bB closed form because both Arg234 salt bridges remain in place (17Janssen B.J. Gomes L. Koning R.I. Svergun D.I. Koster A.J. Fritzinger D.C. Vogel C.W. Gros P. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2469-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We therefore examined effects of the salt bridge mutants on CVFB(Mg2+) formation. Parallel biosensor flow paths were coated with C3b and CVF, respectively, and treated with the E446V and E207A single mutants and wild-type factor B. Data were analyzed with the two-state conformational change model. The E446V mutant had a modest effect on CVF affinity whereas E207A was similar to wild-type factor B (Fig. 6). Further analysis indicated a KD for CVF/E446V of 29 nm, koff1 of 0.020 s−1, and t½ of ∼35 s, versus KD CVF/wild-type factor B of 46 nm, koff1 of 0.038 s−1, and t½ of ∼18 s (Table 1). In short, whereas loss of the Arg234-Glu446 salt bridge resulted in a 5-fold increase in C3b affinity and an 8-fold increase in C3bB(Mg2+) half-life, it resulted in a <2-fold increase in CVF affinity and CVFB(Mg2+) half-life. C3bBb(Mg2+) complexes (t½ ∼90 s) (12Medicus R.G. Götze O. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 1076-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Flierl M.A. Schreiber H. Huber-Lang M.S. J. Invest. Surg. 2006; 19: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are more stable than their C3bB(Mg2+) precursors (t½ ∼5 s; (10Harris C.L. Abbott R.J. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2569-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because the MIDAS is at the center of the C3b:Bb interface, we explored the possibility that the MIDAS structure change during this transition from a low affinity form to a high affinity form. In the case of the integrins, wherein low affinity and high affinity MIDAS structures have been shown, physiologically relevant low affinity MIDAS structures were first observed with the nonphysiological cation Mn2+ (25Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Following that lead, we examined the interaction of C3b and wild-type plasma-derived factor B in the presence of Mn2+. We found that Mn2+ can mediate the formation of C3bB (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, treatment of C3bB(Mn2+) complexes with factor D leads to rapid dissociation of the complex without producing a stable C3bBb product (Fig. 7B). Dissociation required cleavage of the scissile bond: C3bB(Mn2+) complexes that incorporate the R234A mutation (and therefore lack the scissile bond) were insensitive to factor D (Fig. 7C). The simplest interpretation of these results is that Mn2+ can stabilize C3bB in a form that is susceptible to factor D cleavage, but Mn2+ cannot stabilize the C3bBb complex that is produced once cleavage has occurred.

The C3 convertases, C3bBb(Mg2+) and its properdin-stabilized form C3bBbP(Mg2+), are the key enzymes in AP activation and amplification of all of the activation pathways. Strategies designed for the clinical inhibition of the complement AP have focused on the AP components C3b, properdin, factor B, and factor D (6Ricklin D. Lambris J.D. Nat.

The detailed characterization of AP C3 convertase assembly has begun to reveal unique pro-convertase structures that could serve as novel AP-specific therapeutic targets (14Forneris F. Ricklin D.

The factor B scissile bond is sequestered by salt bridges that connect the Arg234 side chain to the linker region and to the VWA domain. We have found that factor B mutations that lack the Arg234-Glu446 salt bridge attain a 5–10-fold increase of Mg2+-dependent C3b binding relative to wild-type factor B due primarily to greater complex stability. From these results we hypothesize that in free factor B and in the initial C3bB association, the Arg234-Glu446 salt bridge constrains the VWA domain to low affinity conformations. When the Arg234-Glu446 salt bridge is broken through thermal effects or precluded through mutagenesis, the α7-helix gains conformational freedom that permits the realignment of the VWA domain and activation of the MIDAS, resulting in a higher affinity association of factor B with C3b. Lesser binding effects were seen with a substitution that precludes only the Arg234-Glu207 salt bridge. This finding suggests that although this second salt bridge needs to be broken to permit factor D cleavage, its release results in a much smaller increase in complex stability. Harris et al. (10Harris C.L. Abbott R.J. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2569-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have provided kinetic evidence that nascent C3bB(Mg2+) can undergo conformational change resulting in a complex with greater stability (see also Ref. 17Janssen B.J. Gomes L. Koning R.I. Svergun D.I. Koster A.J. Fritzinger D.C. Vogel C.W. Gros P. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2469-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The increase in stability they observed could be primarily due to the breakage of one or both Arg234 salt bridges via thermal effects and the subsequent activation of the MIDAS. Although free factor B is not cleaved by factor D, it can be cleaved by other trypsin-like serine proteases such as plasmin (16Taylor F.R. Bixler S.A. Budman J.I. Wen D. Karpusas M. Ryan S.T. Jaworski G.J. Safari-Fard A. Pollard S. Whitty A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2849-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The double latch structure formed by the Arg234 salt bridges serves to minimize such unproductive activity. Our findings suggest how the double latch is opened during assembly of the C3 convertase. We make the simplifying assumption that releases of the two salt bridges are independent and rapidly reversible events, each driven by thermal effects. Therefore, in free factor B, the probability that both latches are open (and the scissile bond is vulnerable to protease activity) is very low. However, in the pro-convertase, stabilization of the pro-convertase with one latch open would provide a greater time window for the second latch to open and expose the scissile bond. Thus, we propose that when factor B first associates with C3b, it bears two intact Arg234 salt bridges. The complex rapidly dissociates unless the Arg234-Glu446 salt bridge is released whereupon conformational changes occur that activate the MIDAS and partially stabilize the complex. The remaining salt bridge is then released, exposing the scissile bond and permitting factor D cleavage. In contrast to C3bB(Mg2+), we found that the assembly of CVFB(Mg2+) complexes was much less affected by the Arg234 salt bridge mutations. The high resolution structural model of CVFB(Mg2+) indicates that the MIDAS can be activated even while the Arg234 salt bridges are in place (17Janssen B.J. Gomes L. Koning R.I. Svergun D.I. Koster A.J. Fritzinger D.C. Vogel C.W. Gros P. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2469-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and so by that accounting, the absence or release of the salt bridges would not have a substantial impact on the stability of the CVFB(Mg2+) complex. The mechanism we propose to facilitate cleavage of factor B in C3bB(Mg2+) would not function fully in CVFB(Mg2+). Consistent with this view, CVFB(Mg2+) is a relatively poor factor D substrate compared with C3bB(Mg2+): factor D cleaves CVF B 100-fold slower than it cleaves C3bB (17Janssen B.J. Gomes L. Koning R.I. Svergun D.I. Koster A.J. Fritzinger D.C. Vogel C.W. Gros P. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2469-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, although CVF and C3b are regarded as homologous in structure (17Janssen B.J. Gomes L. Koning R.I. Svergun D.I. Koster A.J. Fritzinger D.C. Vogel C.W. Gros P. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2469-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), they differ in at least one key dynamic aspect. This difference could bear on the functional roles of C3bBb versus CVFBb. C3bBb(Mg2+) is a protective unit whose assembly and function must be rapid and robust to defend against harmful entities, reaching maximum activity in a few minutes, yet relatively unstable and sensitive to negative regulators to achieve a safe reaction end point. In contrast, CVFBb(Mg2+) is highly stable (24Vogel C.W. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8292-8299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and appears to function to deplete host complement resulting in potentially lethal effects including weakness, hemolysis, and shock. The VWA domain is a versatile structure found in dozens of cell surface receptors and soluble proteins (40Springer T.A. Structure. 2006; 14: 1611-1616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In several members of the integrin family, a VWA domain (referred to in the integrins as an I domain) undergoes conformational changes that drive signal transmission across the plasma membrane (41Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). In that case, critical allosteric changes are coupled to the transition of the MIDAS from a low ligand binding affinity state, in which the divalent cation is coordinated by five conserved amino acids side chains at the apex of the domain, to a high affinity state similar to the C3 convertase, in which the same five coordinating residues are joined by an amino acid residue derived from the ligand (Fig. 1E) (11Rooijakkers S.H. Wu J. Ruyken M. van Domselaar R. Planken K.L. Tzekou A. Ricklin D. Lambris J.D. Janssen B.J. van Strijp J.A. Gros P. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallographic studies of the C3 pro-convertase complexes CVFB(Mg2+), C3bB(Ni2+), and C3bBD(Mg2+) have provided similar high affinity models of the MIDAS (14Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 17Janssen B.J. Gomes L. Koning R.I. Svergun D.I. Koster A.J. Fritzinger D.C. Vogel C.W. Gros P. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2469-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, unlike the C3 convertase model that was derived with wild-type factor B, the three pro-convertase models were derived with the factor B double gain-of-function mutation D254G/N260D, a mutation that eliminates the glycan moiety at Asn260, removes the Asp254 side chain from the MIDAS, and promotes C3bB stability (19Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2906-2911PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, whether the high affinity MIDAS structure seen with the double gain-of-function mutant also mediates wild-type pro-convertase is not known. We propose that the wild-type pro-convertase complex C3bB(Mg2+) can harbor an intermediate MIDAS structure of lesser affinity, possibly lacking the ligand coordination residue (25Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This would better account for the increase in complex stability that accompanies the transition from pro-convertase to convertase even with the loss of binding interactions between C3b and the Ba region (10Harris C.L. Abbott R.J. Smith R.A. Morgan B.P. Lea S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2569-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,14Forneris F. Ricklin D. Wu J. Tzekou A. Wallace R.S. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Science. 2010; 330: 1816-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We show here that Mn2+ stabilizes C3bB in a form that is susceptible to factor D cleavage but cannot sustain the C3bBb complex once factor D cleavage occurs (Fig. 7). It is possible that Mn2+ mediates a low affinity form of the MIDAS that cannot sustain the C3bBb complex. A high resolution model of C3bB(Mn2+) could be informative in this regard. The complement pro-convertases represent an example in which important molecular events are regulated by complex conformational changes. Moreover, they are a promising source of potential therapeutic targets that could be used to address the numerous AP-dependent disease and injury states. Although great progress has been made to delineate the molecular underpinnings of convertase assembly and activity, key aspects remain to be clarified. Our results provide new insight into the dynamics of the scissile bond, the VWA domain, and the MIDAS that occur when the Arg234 salt bridges are released.

https://openalex.org/W1980074336,"Bacillus subtilis trp leader RNA is a small (140-nucleotide) RNA that results from attenuation of trp operon transcription upon binding of the regulatory TRAP complex. Previously, endonucleolytic cleavage by ribonuclease RNase J1 in a 3'-proximal, single-stranded region was shown to be critical for initiation of trp leader RNA decay. RNase J1 is a dual-specificity enzyme, with both 5' exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activities. Here, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that RNase J1 accesses its internal target site on trp leader RNA in a 5' end-independent manner. This has important implications for the role of RNase J1 in RNA decay. We also tested the involvement in trp leader RNA decay of the more recently discovered endonuclease RNase Y. Half-lives of several trp leader RNA constructs, which were designed to probe pathways of endonucleolytic versus exonucleolytic decay, were measured in an RNase Y-deficient mutant. Remarkably, the half-lives of these constructs were indistinguishable from their half-lives in an RNase J1-deficient mutant. These results suggest that lowering RNase Y concentration may affect RNA decay indirectly via an effect on RNase J1, which is thought to exist with RNase Y in a degradosome complex. To generalize our findings with trp leader RNA to other RNAs, we show that the mechanism of trp leader RNA decay is not dependent on TRAP binding."
https://openalex.org/W2005866277,"Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria parasites remodel host erythrocytes by placing membranous structures in the host cell cytoplasm and inserting proteins into the surrounding erythrocyte membranes. Dynamic imaging techniques with high spatial and temporal resolutions are required to study the trafficking pathways of proteins and the time courses of their delivery to the host erythrocyte membrane. Methodology and Findings Using a tetracysteine (TC) motif tag and TC-binding biarsenical fluorophores (BAFs) including fluorescein arsenical hairpin (FlAsH) and resorufin arsenical hairpin (ReAsH), we detected knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) constructs in Pf-parasitized erythrocytes and compared their fluorescence signals to those of GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged KAHRP. Rigorous treatment with BAL (2, 3 dimercaptopropanol; British anti-Lewisite) was required to reduce high background due to nonspecific BAF interactions with endogenous cysteine-rich proteins. After this background reduction, similar patterns of fluorescence were obtained from the TC- and GFP-tagged proteins. The fluorescence from FlAsH and ReAsH-labeled protein bleached at faster rates than the fluorescence from GFP-labeled protein. Conclusion While TC/BAF labeling to Pf-infected erythrocytes is presently limited by high background signals, it may offer a useful complement or alternative to GFP labeling methods. Our observations are in agreement with the currently-accepted model of KAHRP movement through the cytoplasm, including transient association of KAHRP with Maurer's clefts before its incorporation into knobs in the host erythrocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2153501741,"Computational determination of protein-ligand interaction potential is important for many biological applications including virtual screening for therapeutic drugs. The novel internal consensus scoring strategy is an empirical approach with an extended set of 9 binding terms combined with a neural network capable of analysis of diverse complexes. Like conventional consensus methods, internal consensus is capable of maintaining multiple distinct representations of protein-ligand interactions. In a typical use the method was trained using ligand classification data (binding/no binding) for a single receptor. The internal consensus analyses successfully distinguished protein-ligand complexes from decoys (r2, 0.895 for a series of typical proteins). Results are superior to other tested empirical methods. In virtual screening experiments, internal consensus analyses provide consistent enrichment as determined by ROC-AUC and pROC metrics."
