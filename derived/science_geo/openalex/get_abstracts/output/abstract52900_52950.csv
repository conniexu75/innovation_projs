https://openalex.org/W2041762780,"In HEp-2 cells infected with herpes simplex virus the rate of protein synthesis at first decline, is stimulated between 4 and 8 hours after infection, and progressively and irreversibly declines from 9 to 16 hours later. The increase and decrease in rates coincide with corresponding changes in the amounts of cytoplasmic polysomes and amounts of labeled amino acids in nascent peptides bound to polysomes. The data indicate that (i) early and late inhibition and intervening stimulation of protein synthesis are due to the corresponding breakdown and formation of polysomes, and (ii) the bulk of viral proteins is probably made on cytoplasmic polysomes."
https://openalex.org/W1607907081,"Abstract 1. A spectrophotometric procedure is described which specifically measures oxidative phosphorylation in submitochondrial particles in the diphosphopyridine nucleotide-cytochrome b segment of the respiratory chain. It is based on the reduction of exogenous coenzyme Q1 by reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide catalyzed by phosphorylating submitochondrial particles from beef heart and rat liver. 2. Previously described methods for assaying formation of adenosine triphosphate at the first site of oxidative phosphorylation were found to be unsatisfactory. 3. Both the reduction of coenzyme Q1 and the accompanying formation of adenosine triphosphate in this system are unaffected by antimycin and KCN but are almost completely abolished by rotenone or Amytal. 4. The reduction of coenzyme Q1 by succinate is not accompanied by phosphorylation. 5. A survey of various electron acceptors revealed that oxidative phosphorylation at the first phosphorylation site was only observed if electrons passed through the rotenone-sensitive site. 6. In submitochondrial particles from beef heart, octylguanidine, phenethylbiguanidine, and dicumarol failed to exhibit a clear-cut site specificity of action. 7. Addition of the cold-labile, soluble adenosine triphosphatase (F1) to deficient submitochondrial particles stimulated oxidative phosphorylation at all three sites in the respiratory chain."

The carcinogenic effect of such meals for rats, a species relatively resistant to the acute effect of aflatoxin, has been demonstrated2–4 and it has since been shown that crystalline aflatoxin is carcinogenic for these animals5,6."

https://openalex.org/W2148698162,"The effect of the injection into rats of analogs of puromycin, 6-dimethylaminopurine, and the aminonucleoside of puromycin on the stimullation of steroidogenesis by adrenocorticotropic hormone was coin pared with that of puromycin and cycloheximide. This stimulation was blocked only by the antibiotics, which also inhibited adrenal protein synthesis. Glycogenolysis is not associated with the primary mechanism of the adrenocorticotropic hormone stimnulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2056302061,"There is a decrease in the content of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide of tubercle bacilli grown in the presence of isoniazid. In extracts of tubercle bacilli, the activity of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotidase is nil or very small; after incubation with the drug the enzyme becomes active. Isoniazid also increases the activity of the enzyme after it is partially activated by heating. There may be a correlation between the capacity of isoniazid to activate the enzyme and the decrease in the dinucleotide content of the tubercle bacilli."

https://openalex.org/W1516262168,"Abstract 1. The isolation of a pure reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide:(acceptor) oxidoreductase from Pseudomonas putida, strain C1B, in 15% yield is described. 2. The absorption spectrum, fluorescence spectrum, and lack of activity with dye electron acceptors show the isolated enzyme to be devoid of flavin (apoenzyme). Iron, copper, and molybdenum are also absent. 3. One mole of the apoenzyme, molecular weight 36,000, will bind 1 mole of flavin mononucleotide, 2 moles of flavin adenine dinucleotide, or 1 of each when presented with them at equal concentrations. Two flavin-binding sites are present; one is common to both flavins and is catalytically active. The other is specific for flavin adenine and is not involved in catalysis. Equal concentrations of these two flavins are present in crude cell extracts; riboflavin is absent. 4. The dissociation constant, Kd, for the apoenzyme-flavin complex is 4.5 x 10-7 m. The minimum turnover number for reduction of the complex by reduced phosphopyridine nucleotide is 30,000. Michaelis constants, Km, for interaction of free flavin mononucleotide and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide with the complex are 3 x 10-6 m and 10-4 m, respectively. 5. The dissociation constants for the apoenzyme-2 flavin adenine dinucleotide complex lie within the range 2.5 to 7 x 10-6 m. A minimum turnover number for reduction of this complex is 39,000. Michaelis constants for interaction of free flavin adenine and reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide with the complex are 1.9 x 10-5 m and 2.1 x 10-4 m, respectively. 6. Sulfhydryl groups and iron are not involved in flavin or reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide binding; reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide is not bound in the absence of flavin. Oxidation and reduction of an enzyme sulfhydryl group are not involved in catalysis. 7. Reduction of the apoenzyme-flavin complex proceeds by two 1-electron transfer steps. The first, more rapid transfer yields the flavin semiquinone. Reoxidation of the fully reduced complex proceeds by a single 2-electron transfer when free flavin mononucleotide is the electron acceptor. 8. A possible role for the flavin adenine bound to the specific site in coupling this enzyme to an iron-containing mixed function oxidase, which it is known to supply with electrons, is envisaged."

https://openalex.org/W1983668385,"I-Adamantanamine hydrochloride, added to chick embryo cells, inhibited focus production upon subsequent inoculation of the cells with Rous and Esh sarcoma viruses. Addition of the chemical to suspensions of Rous and Esh viruses before they were added to chick cell cultures did not inactivate the viruses; and the addition to chick cells did not prevent plaque formation following their inoculation with Newcastle disease virus. This indicates that cells treated with 1-adamantanamine hydrochloride are capable of supporting viral replication, and these observations suggest that the drug inhibits growth of two oncogenic viruses by prevention of virus penetration, but not by a virucidal effect or cell intoxication."
