https://openalex.org/W1999068559,Atmospheric inputs of sulfuric acid and nitric acid to noncalcareous higher-elevation watersheds in the White Mountain and Adirondack regions lead to comparatively high concentrations of dissolved aluminum in surface and ground waters. This phenomenon appears to result from modern increases in soil aluminum leaching. Transport of this aluminum to acidified lakes can lead to fish mortality. Combined results from areas of silicate bedrock in the United States and Europe suggest that aluminum represents an important biogeochemical linkage between terrestrial and aquatic environments exposed to acid precipitation.

Population sizes of species will decrease to the extent that stochastic events eliminate species as fast as others appear, yielding an equilibrium. A resource diversity control of niche subdivision is therefore not needed to generate an equilibrium number of species. Morphological evolution may decelerate over time for similar reasons."
https://openalex.org/W1965402703,"Biostratigraphic analysis of seven piston cores from the southeastern Blake Plateau suggests that the upper Miocene to Recent sedimentary section at this location represents a history of deposition of calcareous ooze alternating with current-induced nondeposition or erosion. This record is primarily a result of long-term fluctuations in the velocity of the western boundary current or Gulf Stream, which sweeps the plateau. High-velocity phases of this current system, as signaled by hiatuses in the section, lie within the time limits 4.8 to 6.1, 3.9 to 4.4, 2.3 to 2.9, and 0 to 1.5 million years before present (B.P.). These time intervals are coeval with dated episodes of climatic decline and glaciation. The most intense acceleration of the Gulf Stream, as indicated by deep erosion of the Blake Plateau, occurred in the latest Miocene to earliest Pliocene (4.8 to 6.1 million years B.P.) in conjunction with a major expansion of the Antarctic ice cap. Subsequent accelerations of the Gulf Stream coincide with early Pliocene cooling in the Southern Hemisphere, worldwide expansion of high-altitude-high-latitude glaciers in the late Pliocene, and the classical glaciations of the Pleistocene. An additional, protracted increase in the average velocity of the Gulf Stream, which began in the late Miocene and culminated in the mid-Pliocene (about 3.8 million years B.P.), can be attributed to the gradual emergence of the Central American isthmus."

https://openalex.org/W1995118525,The dramatic variation in the composition of a brine pond in Antarctica is a seasonal phenomenon. The phase relations of salts in solution are such that hydrologic conditions and temperature determine composition during the austral summer. Temperature is the primary determinant of composition during the winter.

The scale of phase separation in pyrex was foud to be about 30 angstroms; sample of commercial soda-lime glass, prepared in the same way, showed no phase separtion."
https://openalex.org/W2023809893,"Although it has been postulated that genetic self-incompatibility was involved in the origin of complex heterozygotes in Oenothera subsect Euoenothera, it has not been detected in any species of this well-studied group. It is now reported for populations of Oenothera grandiflora from west central Alabama, and should be sought in other populations of this species, which has been in cultivation for nearly two centuries."
https://openalex.org/W2069536659,"The lunar craters Tycho, Copernicus, and Aristarchus have been observed during lunar night at wavelengths between 3 and 14 microns. After an initial fast decrease to a color temperature of 220°K, the temperature remains nearly constant through the lunar night. The data suggest that these thermal anomalies (craters) contain hot and cold regions with the hot portions constituting 2 to 10 percent of the area and probably thermally connected to a subsurface temperature of about 200°K."
https://openalex.org/W2031405525,"More than a quarter-million cubic meters of liquid radioactive wastes are now being held at government installations awaiting final disposal. During the past 20 years, the disposal plan of choice has been to incorporate the 40 to 50 radioactive elements dissolved in liquid wastes into blocks of glass, seal the glass in metal canisters, and insert the canisters into deep, geologically stable salt beds. Over the last few years, some geologists and materials scientists have become concerned that perhaps not enough is known yet about the interaction of waste, container, and salt (or any rock) to have a reasonable assurance that the hazardous wastes will be contained successfully. The biggest advantage of glass at present is the demonstrated practicality of producing large, highly radioactive blocks of it. The frontrunner as a successor to glass is ceramics, which are nonmetallic crystalline materials formed at high temperature, such as chinaware or natural minerals. An apparent advantage of ceramics is that they already have an ordered atomic structure, whose properties can be tailored to a particular waste element and to conditions of a specific disposal site. A ceramic tailored for waste disposal called supercalcine-ceramic has been developed. It was emphasized that the bestmore » minerals for waste solidification may be those that have proved most stable under natural conditions over geologic time. Disadvantage to ceramics are radiation damage and transmutation. However, it is now obvious that some ceramics are more stable than glass under certain conditions. Metal-encapsulated ceramic, called cermet, is being developed as a waste form. Cermets are considerably more resistant at 100/sup 0/C than a borosilicate waste glass. Researchers are now testing prospective waste forms under the most extreme conditions that might prevail in a waste disposal site. (DP)« less"

https://openalex.org/W2061110760,"A cave in Guerrero, Mexico, investigated in 1968, contained previously unreported Olmec paintings. These paintings, some of the oldest known in Mesoamerica, are stylistically similar to Olmec art from the site of LaVenta, on Mexico's Gulf Coast, but contain several important glyphic motifs never previously known to have existed at this time level. The iconography of the paintings confirms several important hypotheses concerning basic concepts of Olmec religion; the cave itself was probably a shrine to water and fertility. Several pre-Hispanic textile fragments found in the cave are probably from a later culture period."
