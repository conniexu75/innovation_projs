https://openalex.org/W2171332611,"Fluorescent calcium sensors are widely used to image neural activity. Using structure-based mutagenesis and neuron-based screening, we developed a family of ultrasensitive protein calcium sensors (GCaMP6) that outperformed other sensors in cultured neurons and in zebrafish, flies and mice in vivo. In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5-40-µm long). GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales."
https://openalex.org/W1972957600,"Background Acceptorless dehydrogenation (AD) reactions can result not only in simple removal of hydrogen gas from various substrates but also, importantly, in surprisingly efficient and environmentally benign (“green”) synthetic methodologies when intermediates resulting from the initial dehydrogenation process undergo further reactions. Advances Traditionally, dehydrogenation/oxidation reactions of organic compounds have been performed using stoichiometric amounts of inorganic oxidants, in addition to employing various additives, cocatalysts, and catalytic systems that result in generation of copious stoichiometric, often toxic, waste. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation methods, in which stoichiometric amounts of sacrificial organic acceptor compounds are used, also generate stoichiometric amounts of organic waste. Recent developments in catalysis by metal complexes have resulted in acceptorless dehydrogenation reactions that release hydrogen gas and in related reactions in which dehydrogenation is followed by in situ consumption of the generated hydrogen equivalents and no net hydrogen gas is liberated. These reactions circumvent the need for conventional oxidants or sacrificial acceptors and provide an assortment of applications in organic synthesis, including several methods based on further reactivity of the dehydrogenated intermediate compounds. Moreover, the evolved hydrogen gas is valuable in itself. Outlook Further development of new ADs for green, efficient chemical synthesis is expected to be greatly influenced by fundamental organometallic chemistry as a basis for catalyst design. Such processes are highly desirable and are expected to gradually displace elaborate conventional laboratory and industrial synthetic methods. They may also provide opportunities for hydrogen storage cycles, because the dehydrogenation reactions can be reversed under hydrogen pressure using the same catalyst. In general, AD and related dehydrogenative coupling reactions have the potential for redirecting synthetic strategies to the use of sustainable resources, devoid of toxic reagents and deleterious side reactions, with no waste generation."

Hou et al. (p. 651 , published online 18 July) developed an approach to induce pluripotency in somatic cells using a cocktail of small molecules. The ability to generate such chemically induced pluripotent stem cells may provide an alternate route for therapeutic cloning and for drug development in regenerative medicine."

Such enhancement is often attributed to more active sites at the metal-oxide interface, but it can be difficult to quantify this effect. Cargnello et al. (p. 771 , published online 18 July) synthesized monodisperse nanoparticles of nickel, platinum, and palladium and dispersed them on high-surface-area ceria or alumina supports. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy enabled a detailed analysis of interfacial site structure, which showed that the rate of CO oxidation on ceria was indeed enhanced greatly at interface sites."

Haiser et al. (p. 295 ) examined a potential culprit responsible for this transformation—the actinobacterium, Eggerthella lenta —to probe the microbiota-digoxin interaction. Microbe growth was promoted by arginine, and differential expression analysis revealed a two-gene cardiac glycoside reductase ( cgr ) operon that was induced by digoxin in low arginine conditions. Not all strains of E. lenta could reduce digoxin and, when fecal samples from healthy people were tested, a spectrum of digoxin inactivation was detected. When the digoxin-reducing strain of E. lenta was given to germ-free mice that were fed a high-protein (that is, high-arginine) diet, digoxin levels stayed high in serum, and drug inactivation was suppressed."

Giant icosahedral Mimiviruses with genomes of the order of 1 megabase (Mb) were first identified in Acanthamoeba. Digging into antipodean sediments has once again been fruitful where Philippe et al. (p. 281 ; see the cover) discovered some enormous viruses in Acanthamoeba, visible by light microscopy and having genomes up to 2.5 Mb. The Pandoraviruses are phagocytosed by target cells and, after fusing with the phagosome membrane, their contents are released into the cytoplasm where they wreak terrible havoc on its nucleus. These viruses are encased into a tegument-like envelope and lack genes for capsid proteins, and there are no genes for protein translation, adenosine triphosphate generation, or binary fission—confirming their classification as viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2009100350,"Fusion of myoblasts is essential for the formation of multi-nucleated muscle fibres. However, the identity of muscle-specific proteins that directly govern this fusion process in mammals has remained elusive. Here we identify a muscle-specific membrane protein, named myomaker, that controls myoblast fusion. Myomaker is expressed on the cell surface of myoblasts during fusion and is downregulated thereafter. Overexpression of myomaker in myoblasts markedly enhances fusion, and genetic disruption of myomaker in mice causes perinatal death due to an absence of multi-nucleated muscle fibres. Remarkably, forced expression of myomaker in fibroblasts promotes fusion with myoblasts, demonstrating the direct participation of this protein in the fusion process. Pharmacological perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton abolishes the activity of myomaker, consistent with previous studies implicating actin dynamics in myoblast fusion. These findings reveal a long-sought myogenic fusion protein that controls mammalian myoblast fusion and provide new insights into the molecular underpinnings of muscle formation."

In dynamic self-assembly, the ordered patterns require an external energy source, but still form because of intrinsic interactions within the system. Timonen et al. (p. 253 ; see the Perspective by Hermans et al. ) studied the organization of magnetic droplets, in the form of a ferrofluid, placed on a low-friction surface. A time-varying magnetic field transformed the statically arranged droplets into a dynamic pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2067920144,"Playing the Tape of Life Should the tape of life be replayed, would it produce the same music? Many influential evolutionary biologists, notably Stephen J. Gould, have argued that the answer is “no.” However, patterns of convergence among different species filling similar niches all over the world have argued that the answer is neither so simple nor perhaps so negative. Classic cases of convergence, such as marsupials on the Australian continent or cichlids across the African rift lakes, have demonstrated that similar ecological pressures can result in species with similar ecological traits. Such classic examples, however, do not allow for the influence of niche filling based purely on chance. Mahler et al. (p. 292 ) take advantage of the well-studied species clades of Caribbean anoles to examine patterns of adaptation and niche filling across species and islands. Across-islands convergence on a few distinct adaptive peaks (or niches) has driven diversification of species. Anomalies from these ecotypes are only found on the largest, most diverse islands. Thus, ecological niches powerfully shape species and convergence on particular forms is an inherent component of adaptation. Thus, it seems that the tape of life might play the same music, despite being produced by different instruments."
https://openalex.org/W1971119095,"Aberrant neovascularization contributes to diseases such as cancer, blindness and atherosclerosis, and is the consequence of inappropriate angiogenic signalling. Although many regulators of pathogenic angiogenesis have been identified, our understanding of this process is incomplete. Here we explore the transcriptome of retinal microvessels isolated from mouse models of retinal disease that exhibit vascular pathology, and uncover an upregulated gene, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (Lrg1), of previously unknown function. We show that in the presence of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), LRG1 is mitogenic to endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis. Mice lacking Lrg1 develop a mild retinal vascular phenotype but exhibit a significant reduction in pathological ocular angiogenesis. LRG1 binds directly to the TGF-β accessory receptor endoglin, which, in the presence of TGF-β1, results in promotion of the pro-angiogenic Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway. LRG1 antibody blockade inhibits this switch and attenuates angiogenesis. These studies reveal a new regulator of angiogenesis that mediates its effect by modulating TGF-β signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2076216495,"H7N9 Adaptation Puzzling and alarming reports of an outbreak in early 2013 of human infections by a low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus has rocked the poultry industry in central eastern China and brought fears of initiating a human pandemic. Over 130 human cases have been reported with 37 deaths until closure of poultry markets accompanied a near-cessation of human case reports. From surveillance sampling of &gt;10,000 isolates obtained during April 2013, Zhang et al. (p. 410 , published online 18 July) took 37 isolates of avian origin H7N9 and compared them to human H7N9 isolates. The majority of H7N9 isolates came from live poultry markets, although some originated in pigeons. Sequence analysis indicated that the chicken isolates had retained the avian characteristics at sites on the influenza genes for PB2 and the surface hemagglutinin HA, where adaptive mutations have been observed before. Sequence analysis also showed a higher variability in the internal genes than in HA and neuraminidase NA. By using glycan arrays, it was shown that avian and human isolates bound to human, but also to some extent to avian, receptors. As expected, the virus replicated well in chickens without causing disease, whereas in mice only the human isolates were highly pathogenic. The human virus, but not the avian, transmitted between ferrets through the air."

Mahaffy et al. (p. 263 ) present volume-mixing ratios of Mars' five major atmospheric constituents (CO 2 , Ar, N 2 , O 2 , and CO) and isotope measurements of 40 Ar/ 36 Ar and C and O in CO 2 , based on data from one of SAM's instruments, obtained between 31 August and 21 November 2012. Webster et al. (p. 260 ) used data from another of SAM's instruments obtained around the same period to determine isotope ratios of H, C, and O in atmospheric CO 2 and H 2 O. Agreement between the isotopic ratios measured by SAM with those of martian meteorites, measured in laboratories on Earth, confirms the origin of these meteorites and implies that the current atmospheric reservoirs of CO 2 and H 2 O were largely established after the period of early atmospheric loss some 4 billion years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2049776490,"Introduction Ribosome biogenesis is commonly up-regulated to satisfy the increased anabolic demands associated with malignant transformation and tumor growth. Many different oncogenic signaling pathways converge on the ribosome to increase translational flux. Despite the detailed understanding of ribosome regulation in cancer, it is not clear whether the net translational activity of the ribosome can itself regulate transcriptional programs that support and promote the malignant state. Methods To investigate the transcriptional effects of modulating translational activity in malignant cells, we used integrated chemical and genetic approaches, including a gene signature–based genetic and chemical screen of more than 600,000 gene expression profiles (LINCS database) and an independent, reporter-based chemical screen of more than 300,000 compounds. A lead compound was tested in several cell-lines unified by their increased dependence on HSF1 activation for growth and survival, and in an in vivo cancer model. Results Inhibiting translation led to large changes in the transcriptome. The single most enriched category consisted of genes regulated by the heat-shock transcription factor, HSF1. The most down-regulated mRNA was HSPA8 , which encodes the constitutive HSP70 chaperone that helps to fold nascent polypeptides. The expression of many other genes that HSF1 coordinates to support cancer were also strongly affected. HSF1 protein levels were unchanged, but HSF1 DNA occupancy was nearly eliminated. Inhibition of the HSF1-regulated gene expression program is thus a dominant transcriptional effect elicited by inhibiting protein translation. Using a gene signature of HSF1 inactivation to query the LINCS database revealed a strong connection between HSF1 inactivation and perturbations that inhibit protein translation, including a broad spectrum of chemical and genetic interventions that target the ribosome, eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, and upstream signaling/regulatory pathways that control translation. Our high-throughput small-molecule screen identified rocaglamide A, an inhibitor of translation initiation, was the strongest inhibitor of HSF1 activation. An analog of this compound, RHT, increased thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) mRNA and protein levels and decreased glucose uptake and lactate production. Cell-based cancer models characterized by high dependence on HSF1 activation for growth and survival were highly sensitive to RHT, as were cells derived from diverse hematopoietic malignancies. RHT had a strong antitumor effect—with marked inhibition of HSF1 activity and glucose uptake—against xenografted acute myeloid leukemia cells. Discussion The ribosome functions as a central information hub in malignant cells: Translational flux conveys information about the cell’s metabolic status to regulate the transcriptional programs that support it. Multiple unbiased chemical and genetic approaches establish HSF1 as a prime transducer of this information, centrally poised to regulate the transcription of genes that support protein folding, biomass expansion, anabolic metabolism, cellular proliferation, and survival. Targeting translation initiation may offer a strategy for reversing HSF1 activation, disabling metabolic and cytoprotective pathways in malignant cells. HSF1 at the crossroads of protein translation and metabolism. ( Left ) Cancers activate an HSF1-regulated transcriptional program to adapt to the anabolic demands of relentless biomass expansion. Glucose uptake increases, and expression of TXNIP, an inhibitor of glucose uptake, drops. ( Right ) Down-regulating translation with rocaglate scaffold initiation inhibitors reverses cancer-associated HSF1 activation. Glucose uptake drops as TXNIP levels rise."

The transcription factor PU.1 is an important determinant in the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors to lymphocytes or myeloid cells, where high expression induces macrophage differentiation, whereas low expression leads to the development of B lymphocytes. How PU.1 expression levels are regulated during this cell fate choice, however, is not well understood. Kueh et al. (p. 670 , published online 18 July) found that in mice, reduced transcription of PU.1 led to its reduced expression in developing B lymphocytes, whereas in macrophages, PU.1 was able to accumulate stably because of a lengthening of the cell cycle. Exogenous expression of PU.1 in progenitors supported cell cycle lengthening and macrophage differentiation, and mathematical modeling suggested that such a feedback loop could maintain a slow-dividing macrophage developmental state."

A key reactive intermediate in the oxidative reactions catalysed by mononuclear non-haem iron (NHFe) enzymes is the high-spin species S = 2 Fe(IV) = O. In this manuscript the authors use synchrotron-based nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS), a sensitive method that defines the dependence of the vibrational modes of Fe on the nature of the Fe(IV) = O active site, to determine the structure of the reactive intermediate of the halogenase SyrB2 from the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. This intermediate reacts via an initial hydrogen-atom abstraction step, with its subsequent halogenation (native) or hydroxylation (non-native) rebound reactivity being dependent on the substrate. The substrate directs the orientation of the oxo intermediate, presenting specific frontier molecular orbitals that can activate the selective halogenation versus hydroxylation reactivity. Mononuclear non-haem iron (NHFe) enzymes catalyse a broad range of oxidative reactions, including halogenation, hydroxylation, ring closure, desaturation and aromatic ring cleavage reactions. They are involved in a number of biological processes, including phenylalanine metabolism, the production of neurotransmitters, the hypoxic response and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites1,2,3. The reactive intermediate in the catalytic cycles of these enzymes is a high-spin S = 2 Fe(iv)=O species, which has been trapped for a number of NHFe enzymes4,5,6,7,8, including the halogenase SyrB2 (syringomycin biosynthesis enzyme 2). Computational studies aimed at understanding the reactivity of this Fe(iv)=O intermediate9,10,11,12,13 are limited in applicability owing to the paucity of experimental knowledge about its geometric and electronic structure. Synchrotron-based nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) is a sensitive and effective method that defines the dependence of the vibrational modes involving Fe on the nature of the Fe(iv)=O active site14,15,16. Here we present NRVS structural characterization of the reactive Fe(iv)=O intermediate of a NHFe enzyme, namely the halogenase SyrB2 from the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. This intermediate reacts via an initial hydrogen-atom abstraction step, performing subsequent halogenation of the native substrate or hydroxylation of non-native substrates17. A correlation of the experimental NRVS data to electronic structure calculations indicates that the substrate directs the orientation of the Fe(iv)=O intermediate, presenting specific frontier molecular orbitals that can activate either selective halogenation or hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W2067158285,"A number of environmental factors (e.g. toxicants) have been shown to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and phenotypic variation. Transgenerational inheritance requires the germline transmission of altered epigenetic information between generations in the absence of direct environmental exposures. The primary periods for epigenetic programming of the germ line are those associated with primordial germ cell development and subsequent fetal germline development. The current study examined the actions of an agricultural fungicide vinclozolin on gestating female (F0 generation) progeny in regards to the primordial germ cell (PGC) epigenetic reprogramming of the F3 generation (i.e. great-grandchildren). The F3 generation germline transcriptome and epigenome (DNA methylation) were altered transgenerationally. Interestingly, disruptions in DNA methylation patterns and altered transcriptomes were distinct between germ cells at the onset of gonadal sex determination at embryonic day 13 (E13) and after cord formation in the testis at embryonic day 16 (E16). A larger number of DNA methylation abnormalities (epimutations) and transcriptional alterations were observed in the E13 germ cells than in the E16 germ cells. These observations indicate that altered transgenerational epigenetic reprogramming and function of the male germline is a component of vinclozolin induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. Insights into the molecular control of germline transmitted epigenetic inheritance are provided."
https://openalex.org/W1976952431,"A fundamental and previously unobserved aspect of the Josephson effect is revealed through spectroscopic measurements of the excited Andreev states in superconducting atomic contacts. Brian Josephson proposed in 1962 that a dissipationless 'supercurrent' should flow between two superconductors separated by a weak link such as a tunnel junction. He was right, and the Josephson effect launched a new field of research with applications to magnetometry, medicine and astronomy. This paper describes an aspect of the Josephson effect that has previously been overlooked. Existing Josephson junction applications are based on properties of just the ground state, in which the electron pairs that carry the supercurrent localize at the weak link and form so-called Andreev doublets of ground and excited pair states. Bretheau et al. establish the existence of excited Andreev pair states through spectroscopic measurements of superconducting atomic contacts. This previously overlooked degree of freedom for tunneling electron pairs is a new quantum resource that could be exploited in novel types of superconducting qubits. The Josephson effect describes the flow of supercurrent in a weak link—such as a tunnel junction, nanowire or molecule—between two superconductors1. It is the basis for a variety of circuits and devices, with applications ranging from medicine2 to quantum information3. Experiments using Josephson circuits that behave like artificial atoms4 are now revolutionizing the way we probe and exploit the laws of quantum physics5,6. Microscopically, the supercurrent is carried by Andreev pair states, which are localized at the weak link. These states come in doublets and have energies inside the superconducting gap7,8,9,10. Existing Josephson circuits are based on properties of just the ground state of each doublet, and so far the excited states have not been directly detected. Here we establish their existence through spectroscopic measurements of superconducting atomic contacts. The spectra, which depend on the atomic configuration and on the phase difference between the superconductors, are in complete agreement with theory. Andreev doublets could be exploited to encode information in novel types of superconducting qubits11,12,13."
https://openalex.org/W2036800202,"The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is essential for control of energy homeostasis in vertebrates. MC4R interacts with melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 (MRAP2) in vitro, but its functions in vivo are unknown. We found that MRAP2a, a larval form, stimulates growth of zebrafish by specifically blocking the action of MC4R. In cell culture, this protein binds MC4R and reduces the ability of the receptor to bind its ligand, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). A paralog, MRAP2b, expressed later in development, also binds MC4R but increases ligand sensitivity. Thus, MRAP2 proteins allow for developmental control of MC4R activity, with MRAP2a blocking its function and stimulating growth during larval development, whereas MRAP2b enhances responsiveness to α-MSH once the zebrafish begins feeding, thus increasing the capacity for regulated feeding and growth."
https://openalex.org/W2035955498,"Dysfunction of two structurally and functionally related proteins, FUS and TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), implicated in crucial steps of cellular RNA metabolism can cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and certain other neurodegenerative diseases. The proteins are intrinsically aggregate-prone and form non-amyloid inclusions in the affected nervous tissues, but the role of these proteinaceous aggregates in disease onset and progression is still uncertain. To address this question, we designed a variant of FUS, FUS 1-359, which is predominantly cytoplasmic, highly aggregate-prone, and lacks a region responsible for RNA recognition and binding. Expression of FUS 1-359 in neurons of transgenic mice, at a level lower than that of endogenous FUS, triggers FUSopathy associated with severe damage of motor neurons and their axons, neuroinflammatory reaction, and eventual loss of selective motor neuron populations. These pathological changes cause abrupt development of a severe motor phenotype at the age of 2.5-4.5 months and death of affected animals within several days of onset. The pattern of pathology in transgenic FUS 1-359 mice recapitulates several key features of human ALS with the dynamics of the disease progression compressed in line with shorter mouse lifespan. Our data indicate that neuronal FUS aggregation is sufficient to cause ALS-like phenotype in transgenic mice."

https://openalex.org/W1998316337,"Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling is crucial for growth, cell fate determination, and axonal guidance in the developing nervous system. Although the receptors Patched (Ptch1) and Smoothened (Smo) are required for Shh signaling, a number of distinct co-receptors contribute to these critical responses to Shh. Several membrane-embedded proteins such as Boc, Cdo, and Gas1 bind Shh and promote signaling. In addition, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have also been implicated in the initiation of Shh responses. However, the attributes of HSPGs that function as co-receptors for Shh have not yet been defined. Here, we identify HSPGs containing a glypican 5 core protein and 2-O-sulfo-iduronic acid residues at the nonreducing ends of the glycans as co-receptors for Shh. These HSPG co-receptors are expressed by cerebellar granule cell precursors and promote Shh binding and signaling. At the subcellular level, these HSPG co-receptors are located adjacent to the primary cilia that act as Shh signaling organelles. Thus, Shh binds to HSPG co-receptors containing a glypican 5 core and 2-O-sulfo-iduronic acid to promote neural precursor proliferation."

IL-8, a major chemotactic cytokine for neutrophils and T lymphocytes, plays important roles in the development of lung injury. To further understand the role of ESAT-6 in lung pathology associated with tuberculosis development, we studied the effects of ESAT-6 on the regulation of IL-8 expression in lung epithelial cells. ESAT-6 induced IL-8 expression by increasing IL-8 gene transcription and mRNA stability. ESAT-6 induction of IL-8 promoter activity was dependent on nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding and sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of PKC and ERK and p38 MAPK pathways. ESAT-6 activated ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation and rapidly induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Dimethylthiourea but not mannitol inhibited IL-8 induction by ESAT-6, further supporting the involvement of ROS in the induction of IL-8 expression. Exposure of mice to ESAT-6 induced localized inflammatory cell aggregate formation with characteristics of early granuloma concomitant with increased keratinocyte chemoattractant CXCL1 staining in bronchiolar and alveolar type II epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. Our studies have identified a signal transduction pathway involving ROS, PKC, ERK, and p38 MAPKs and NF-κB and AP-1 in the ESAT-6 induction of IL-8 expression in lung epithelial cells. This has important implications for the understanding of lung innate immune responses to tuberculosis and the pathogenesis of lung injury in tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2060974842,"Most of the therapeutic antibodies approved for clinical use are full-size IgG1 molecules. The interaction of the IgG1 Fc with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) plays a critical role in maintaining their long half-life. We have hypothesized that isolated Fc domains could be engineered to functionally mimic full-size IgG1 (nanoantibodies) but with decreased (10-fold) size. Here, we report for the first time the successful generation of a soluble, monomeric CH3 domain (mCH3). In contrast to the wild-type dimeric CH3, the mCH3 exhibited pH-dependent binding to FcRn similar to that of Fc. The binding free energy of mCH3 to FcRn was higher than that of isolated CH2 but lower than that of Fc. Therefore, CH3 may contribute a larger portion of the free energy of binding to FcRn than CH2. A fusion protein of mCH3 with an engineered antibody domain (m36.4) also bound to FcRn in a pH-dependent fashion and exhibited significantly higher neutralizing activity against HIV-1 than m36.4-Fc fusion proteins. The m36.4-mCH3 fusion protein was monomeric, stable, soluble, and expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli. We also found that engineering an additional disulfide bond in mCH3 remarkably increased its thermal stability, whereas the FcRn binding was not affected. These data suggest that mCH3 could not only help in the exploration of the dual mechanisms of the CH3 contribution to Fc functions (dimerization and FcRn interactions) but could also be used for the development of candidate therapeutics with optimized half-life, enhanced tissue penetration, access to sterically restricted binding sites, and increased therapeutic efficacy."

It has been reported recently that LRP1 activation could phosphorylate the neurotrophin receptor TrkA in PC12 cells and increase neurite outgrowth from developing cerebellar granule cells. These intriguing findings led us to explore the hypothesis that LRP1 activation would activate canonical neurotrophic factor signaling in adult neurons and promote axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury. We now find that treatment of adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro with LRP1 agonists (the receptor binding domain of α-2-macroglobulin or the hemopexin domain of matrix metalloproteinase 9) induces TrkC, Akt, and ERK activation; significantly increases neurite outgrowth (p < 0.01); and overcomes myelin inhibition (p < 0.05).

Signal. 2009; 2: ra18Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The latter findings identify a candidate mechanism for potential actions of LRP1 on axonal function and suggest the hypothesis that LRP1 activation could promote axonal sprouting and regeneration in the adult CNS. Synthetic LRP1 ligands have been generated, including several fusion proteins that can be readily infused into the CNS to test potential activities in injury models. We now report potent effects of LRP1-binding ligands on axonal growth in vitro and after spinal cord injury in vivo, identifying a novel LRP1-dependent cell signaling mechanism involved in CNS plasticity and regeneration. These effects result from canonical LRP1 ligand transactivation of Trk. In vitro experiments determined whether LRP1 agonists promote neurite outgrowth from cultures of dissociated primary adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and on signaling mechanisms activated by LRP1 receptor signaling. A second set of “ex vivo” experiments determined whether intrathecal infusion of LRP1 agonists for 3 days would also stimulate growth-related neuronal signaling and neurite outgrowth in DRG neurons that were subsequently removed and cultured in vitro. Finally, in vivo experiments assessed the ability of intrathecal infusions of LRP1 agonists to promote sprouting or regeneration of the central processes of DRG neurons projecting through the dorsal columns after C4 dorsal spinal cord lesions. All experiments examined the same population of large-diameter, neurofilament 200 (NF200)-expressing, NT-3-sensitive DRG neurons. GST fusion proteins that directly bind LRP1 and are LRP1 agonists were prepared as described previously (24Mettenburg J.M. Webb D.J. Gonias S.L.

However, the molecular mechanisms of the regulation of actin dynamics by intracellular signals in pancreatic β-cells and its role in phasic insulin secretion are largely unknown. In this study, we elucidate the regulation of actin dynamics by neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and cofilin in pancreatic β-cells and demonstrate its role in glucose-induced insulin secretion (GIIS). N-WASP, which promotes actin polymerization through activation of the actin nucleation factor Arp2/3 complex, was found to be activated by glucose stimulation in insulin-secreting clonal pancreatic β-cells (MIN6-K8 β-cells). Introduction of a dominant-negative mutant of N-WASP, which lacks G-actin and Arp2/3 complex-binding region VCA, into MIN6-K8 β-cells or knockdown of N-WASP suppressed GIIS, especially the second phase. We also found that cofilin, which severs F-actin in its dephosphorylated (active) form, is converted to the phosphorylated (inactive) form by glucose stimulation in MIN6-K8 β-cells, thereby promoting F-actin remodeling. In addition, the dominant-negative mutant of cofilin, which inhibits activation of endogenous cofilin, or knockdown of cofilin reduced the second phase of GIIS. However, the first phase of GIIS occurs in the G-actin predominant state, in which cofilin activity predominates over N-WASP activity. Thus, actin dynamics regulated by the balance of N-WASP and cofilin activities determines the biphasic response of GIIS."
https://openalex.org/W1977566315,"Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is an important system that eliminates misfolded proteins from the ER. Three derlins have been implicated in this process, but their precise function remains unknown. In this study, we report that although both derlin1 and derlin2 are capable of binding the ERAD-specific ubiquitin ligase HRD1, they associate with the HRD1-containing complex with different affinities. Accordingly, these derlins have nonredundant functions in ERAD with derlin2 being an essential functional partner for HRD1-mediated ERAD of SHH and NHK. We show that derlin2, but not derlin1 or derlin3, is required for ERAD of both glycosylated and nonglycosylated SHH, as well as NHK. Derlin2 appears to act at a post-targeting step for HRD1-dependent retro-translocation. Without derlin2, the assembly of HRD1 into a functional retro-translocation homo-oligomer proceeds normally, and substrate targeting to the HRD1 complex also occurs. However, the ERAD substrate SHH-C is largely trapped inside the ER lumen. These observations raise the possibility that derlin2 may regulate the movement of substrates through the HRD1-containing retro-translocon. Our study is the first to report that derlin2 functions with HRD1 in ERAD of certain substrates independent of their glycosylation status. The mammalian ERAD system may require multiple derlins that each functions with a distinct E3 partner to eliminate a specific subset of substrates. This is different from the model in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which Hrd1p alone is sufficient for retro-translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2065357505,"It remains controversial whether adult pancreatic ducts harbor facultative beta cell progenitors. Because neurogenin3 (Ngn3) is a key determinant of pancreatic endocrine cell neogenesis during embryogenesis, many studies have also relied upon Ngn3 expression as evidence of beta cell neogenesis in adults. Recently, however, Ngn3 as a marker of adult beta cell neogenesis has been called into question by reports of Ngn3 expression in fully-developed beta cells. Nevertheless, direct evidence as to whether Ngn3 activation in adult pancreatic duct cells may lead to duct-to-beta cell transdifferentiation is lacking. Here we studied two models of Ngn3 activation in adult pancreatic duct cells (low-dose alloxan treatment and pancreatic duct ligation) and lineage-traced Ngn3-activated duct cells by labeling them through intraductal infusion with a cell-tagging dye, CFDA-SE No dye-labeled beta cells were found during the follow-up in either model, suggesting that activation of Ngn3 in duct cells is not sufficient to direct their transdifferentiation into beta cells. Therefore, Ngn3 activation in duct cells is not a signature for adult beta cell neogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2056966322,"Background No clinical trials have assessed the effects or cost-effectiveness of health check strategies to detect and manage vascular disease. We used a mathematical model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of several health check strategies in six European countries. Methods We used country-specific data from Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom to generate simulated populations of individuals aged 40–75 eligible for health checks in those countries (e.g. individuals without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or serious chronic kidney disease). For each country, we used the Archimedes model to compare seven health check strategies consisting of assessments for diabetes, hypertension, lipids, and smoking. For patients diagnosed with vascular disease, treatment was simulated in a standard manner. We calculated the effects of each strategy on the incidence of type 2 diabetes, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and microvascular complications in addition to quality of life, costs, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results Compared with current care, health checks reduced the incidence of MACE (6–17 events prevented per 1000 people screened) and diabetes related microvasular complications (5–11 events prevented per 1000 people screened), and increased QALYs (31–59 discounted QALYs) over 30 years, in all countries. The cost per QALY of offering a health check to all individuals in the study cohort ranged from €14903 (France) to cost saving (Poland). Pre-screening the population and offering health checks only to higher risk individuals lowered the cost per QALY. Pre-screening on the basis of obesity had a cost per QALY of €10200 (France) or less, and pre-screening with a non-invasive risk score was similar. Conclusions A vascular disease health check would likely be cost effective at 30 years in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom."

https://openalex.org/W1985801486,"A conserved guanosine at position 18 (G18) in the D-loop of tRNAs is often modified to 2'-O-methylguanosine (Gm). Formation of Gm18 in eubacterial tRNA is catalyzed by tRNA (Gm18) methyltransferase (TrmH). TrmH enzymes can be divided into two types based on their substrate tRNA specificity. Type I TrmH, including Thermus thermophilus TrmH, can modify all tRNA species, whereas type II TrmH, for example Escherichia coli TrmH, modifies only a subset of tRNA species. Our previous crystal study showed that T. thermophilus TrmH is a class IV S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase, which maintains a topological knot structure in the catalytic domain. Because TrmH enzymes have short stretches at the N and C termini instead of a clear RNA binding domain, these stretches are believed to be involved in tRNA recognition. In this study, we demonstrate by site-directed mutagenesis that both N- and C-terminal regions function in tRNA binding. However, in vitro and in vivo chimera protein studies, in which four chimeric proteins of type I and II TrmHs were used, demonstrated that the catalytic domain discriminates substrate tRNAs from nonsubstrate tRNAs. Thus, the N- and C-terminal regions do not function in the substrate tRNA discrimination process. Pre-steady state analysis of complex formation between mutant TrmH proteins and tRNA by stopped-flow fluorescence measurement revealed that the C-terminal region works in the initial binding process, in which nonsubstrate tRNA is not excluded, and that structural movement of the motif 2 region of the catalytic domain in an induced-fit process is involved in substrate tRNA discrimination."

https://openalex.org/W2111128152,"Macrophages (MΦs) determine oral mucosal responses; mediating tolerance to commensal microbes and food whilst maintaining the capacity to activate immune defences to pathogens. MΦ responses are determined by both differentiation and activation stimuli, giving rise to two distinct subsets; pro-inflammatory M1- and anti-inflammatory/regulatory M2- MΦs. M2-like subsets predominate tolerance induction whereas M1 MΦs predominate in inflammatory pathologies, mediating destructive inflammatory mechanisms, such as those in chronic P.gingivalis (PG) periodontal infection. MΦ responses can be suppressed to benefit either the host or the pathogen. Chronic stimulation by bacterial pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as LPS, is well established to induce tolerance. The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of MΦ subsets to suppression by P. gingivalis. CD14hi and CD14lo M1- and M2-like MΦs were generated in vitro from the THP-1 monocyte cell line by differentiation with PMA and vitamin D3, respectively. MΦ subsets were pre-treated with heat-killed PG (HKPG) and PG-LPS prior to stimulation by bacterial PAMPs. Modulation of inflammation was measured by TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 ELISA and NFκB activation by reporter gene assay. HKPG and PG-LPS differentially suppress PAMP-induced TNFα, IL-6 and IL-10 but fail to suppress IL-1β expression in M1 and M2 MΦs. In addition, P.gingivalis suppressed NFκB activation in CD14lo and CD14hi M2 regulatory MΦs and CD14lo M1 MΦs whereas CD14hi M1 pro-inflammatory MΦs were refractory to suppression. In conclusion, P.gingivalis selectively tolerises regulatory M2 MΦs with little effect on pro-inflammatory CD14hi M1 MΦs; differential suppression facilitating immunopathology at the expense of immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2044059900,"Background The psychotomimetic effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists in healthy humans and their tendency to aggravate psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients have promoted the notion of altered glutamatergic neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Methods The NMDA-receptor antagonist MK-801 was chronically administered to rats (0.02 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 14 days). In one subgroup the antipsychotic haloperidol (1 mg/kg) was employed as a rescue therapy. Glutamate distribution and 3-NT (3-nitrotyrosine) as a marker of oxidative stress were assessed by immunohistochemistry in tissue sections. In parallel, the effects of MK-801 and haloperidol were investigated in primary embryonal hippocampal cell cultures from rats. Results Chronic NMDA-R antagonism led to a marked increase of intracellular glutamate in the hippocampus (126.1 +/− 10.4% S.E.M of control; p = 0.037), while 3-NT staining intensity remained unaltered. No differences were observed in extrahippocampal brain regions. Essentially these findings could be reproduced in vitro. Conclusion The combined in vivo and in vitro strategy allowed us to assess the implications of disturbed glutamate metabolism for the occurrence of oxidative stress and to investigate the effects of antipsychotics. Our data suggest that oxidative stress plays a minor role in this model than previously suggested. The same applies to apoptosis. Moreover, the effect of haloperidol seems to be mediated through yet unidentified mechanisms, unrelated to D2-antagonism. These convergent lines of evidence indicate that further research should be focused on the glutamatergic system and that our animal model may provide a tool to explore the biology of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2057514689,"The proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I/NDH-1) contains a peripheral and a membrane domain. Three antiporter-like subunits in the membrane domain, NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN (ND5, ND4 and ND2, respectively), are structurally similar. We analyzed the role of NuoN in Escherichia coli NDH-1. The lysine residue at position 395 in NuoN (NLys(395)) is conserved in NuoL (LLys(399)) but is replaced by glutamic acid (MGlu(407)) in NuoM. Our mutation study on NLys(395) suggests that this residue participates in the proton translocation. Furthermore, we found that MGlu(407) is also essential and most likely interacts with conserved LArg(175). Glutamic acids, NGlu(133), MGlu(144), and LGlu(144), are corresponding residues. Unlike mutants of MGlu(144) and LGlu(144), mutation of NGlu(133) scarcely affected the energy-transducing activities. However, a double mutant of NGlu(133) and nearby KGlu(72) showed significant inhibition of these activities. This suggests that NGlu(133) bears a functional role similar to LGlu(144) and MGlu(144) but its mutation can be partially compensated by the nearby carboxyl residue. Conserved prolines located at loops of discontinuous transmembrane helices of NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN were shown to play a similar role in the energy-transducing activity. It seems likely that NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN pump protons by a similar mechanism. Our data also revealed that NLys(158) is one of the key interaction points with helix HL in NuoL. A truncation study indicated that the C-terminal amphipathic segments of NTM14 interacts with the Mβ sheet located on the opposite side of helix HL. Taken together, the mechanism of H(+) translocation in NDH-1 is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1963727743,"The functional significance of the widespread down-regulation of Rap1 GTPase-activating protein (Rap1GAP), a negative regulator of Rap activity, in human tumors is unknown. Here we show that human colon cancer cells depleted of Rap1GAP are endowed with more aggressive migratory and invasive properties. Silencing Rap1GAP enhanced the migration of confluent and single cells. In the latter, migration distance, velocity, and directionality were increased. Enhanced migration was a consequence of increased endogenous Rap activity as silencing Rap expression selectively abolished the migration of Rap1GAP-depleted cells. ROCK-mediated cell contractility was suppressed in Rap1GAP-depleted cells, which exhibited a spindle-shaped morphology and abundant membrane protrusions. Tumor cells can switch between Rho/ROCK-mediated contractility-based migration and Rac1-mediated mesenchymal motility. Strikingly, the migration of Rap1GAP-depleted, but not control cells required Rac1 activity, suggesting that loss of Rap1GAP alters migratory mechanisms. Inhibition of Rac1 activity restored membrane blebbing and increased ROCK activity in Rap1GAP-depleted cells, suggesting that Rac1 contributes to the suppression of contractility. Collectively, these findings identify Rap1GAP as a critical regulator of aggressive tumor cell behavior and suggest that the level of Rap1GAP expression influences the migratory mechanisms that are operative in tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026105402,"Background Arthropods are the most diverse group of eukaryotic organisms, but their phylogenetic relationships are poorly understood. Herein, we describe three mitochondrial genomes representing orders of millipedes for which complete genomes had not been characterized. Newly sequenced genomes are combined with existing data to characterize the protein coding regions of myriapods and to attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships within the Myriapoda and Arthropoda. Results The newly sequenced genomes are similar to previously characterized millipede sequences in terms of synteny and length. Unique translocations occurred within the newly sequenced taxa, including one half of the Appalachioria falcifera genome, which is inverted with respect to other millipede genomes. Across myriapods, amino acid conservation levels are highly dependent on the gene region. Additionally, individual loci varied in the level of amino acid conservation. Overall, most gene regions showed low levels of conservation at many sites. Attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships suffered from questionable relationships and low support values. Analyses of phylogenetic informativeness show the lack of signal deep in the trees (i.e., genes evolve too quickly). As a result, the myriapod tree resembles previously published results but lacks convincing support, and, within the arthropod tree, well established groups were recovered as polyphyletic. Conclusions The novel genome sequences described herein provide useful genomic information concerning millipede groups that had not been investigated. Taken together with existing sequences, the variety of compositions and evolution of myriapod mitochondrial genomes are shown to be more complex than previously thought. Unfortunately, the use of mitochondrial protein-coding regions in deep arthropod phylogenetics appears problematic, a result consistent with previously published studies. Lack of phylogenetic signal renders the resulting tree topologies as suspect. As such, these data are likely inappropriate for investigating such ancient relationships."

https://openalex.org/W2092013288,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a causative agent of nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia. Penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae depends in part upon MurM, an aminoacyl-tRNA ligase that attaches l-serine or l-alanine to the stem peptide lysine of Lipid II in cell wall peptidoglycan. To investigate the exact substrates the translation machinery provides MurM, quality control by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) was investigated. AlaRS mischarged serine and glycine to tRNAAla, as observed in other bacteria, and also transferred alanine, serine, and glycine to tRNAPhe. S. pneumoniae tRNAPhe has an unusual U4:C69 mismatch in its acceptor stem that prevents editing by phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS), leading to the accumulation of misaminoacylated tRNAs that could serve as substrates for translation or for MurM. Although the peptidoglycan layer of S. pneumoniae tolerates a combination of both branched and linear muropeptides, deletion of MurM results in a reversion to penicillin sensitivity in strains that were previously resistant. However, because MurM is not required for cell viability, the reason for its functional conservation across all strains of S. pneumoniae has remained elusive. We now show that MurM can directly function in translation quality control by acting as a broad specificity lipid-independent trans editing factor that deacylates tRNA. This activity of MurM does not require the presence of its second substrate, Lipid II, and can functionally substitute for the activity of widely conserved editing domain homologues of AlaRS, termed AlaXPs proteins, which are themselves absent from S. pneumoniae.Background: MurM utilizes aminoacyl-tRNAs and Lipid II for peptidoglycan biosynthesis in Streptococcus pneumoniae.Results: MurM deacylates mischarged aminoacyl-tRNAs in the absence of Lipid II.Conclusion: The ability of MurM to function in quality control can compensate for the absence of AlaXp proteins in S. pneumoniae.Significance: MurM can function in translation as a lipid-independent trans editing factor. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a causative agent of nosocomial infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia. Penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae depends in part upon MurM, an aminoacyl-tRNA ligase that attaches l-serine or l-alanine to the stem peptide lysine of Lipid II in cell wall peptidoglycan. To investigate the exact substrates the translation machinery provides MurM, quality control by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) was investigated. AlaRS mischarged serine and glycine to tRNAAla, as observed in other bacteria, and also transferred alanine, serine, and glycine to tRNAPhe. S. pneumoniae tRNAPhe has an unusual U4:C69 mismatch in its acceptor stem that prevents editing by phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS), leading to the accumulation of misaminoacylated tRNAs that could serve as substrates for translation or for MurM. Although the peptidoglycan layer of S. pneumoniae tolerates a combination of both branched and linear muropeptides, deletion of MurM results in a reversion to penicillin sensitivity in strains that were previously resistant.

Significance: MurM can function in translation as a lipid-independent trans editing factor. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive diplococcus that is carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx of 5–10% of healthy adults and 20–40% of healthy children. Clinically, S. pneumoniae is the common causative agent of several community and hospital acquired infections including pneumonia, otitis media, meningitis, and septicemia. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), ∼5 million fatal cases of pneumococcal pneumonia in children under the age of five are reported globally each year (37.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2013) http://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/surveillance.html,Google Scholar). Pneumococci have an unusual lifestyle because they produce high levels of hydrogen peroxide that provides a competitive advantage for the organism during colonization of the nasopharynx (1.Pesakhov S. Benisty R. Sikron N. Cohen Z. Gomelsky P. Khozin-Goldberg I. Dagan R. Porat N.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6532-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In other organisms, it has been reported that exposure to increased levels of hydrogen peroxide can enhance cellular mistranslation rates both in vivo and in vitro (3.Netzer N. Goodenbour J.M. David A. Dittmar K.A. Jones R.B. Schneider J.R. Boone D. Eves E.M. Rosner M.R. Gibbs J.S. Embry A. Dolan B. Das S. Hickman H.D. Berglund P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Pan T.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4028-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For example, in mammalian cells, ∼1% of protein synthesis-directed methionine residues are aminoacylated onto noncognate tRNA molecules. This methionine misaminoacylation is increased as much as 10-fold in the presence of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide. Substitution of coded amino acids with methionine is believed to protect proteins against oxidative damage under stress conditions (3.Netzer N. Goodenbour J.M. David A. Dittmar K.A. Jones R.B. Schneider J.R. Boone D. Eves E.M. Rosner M.R. Gibbs J.S. Embry A. Dolan B. Das S. Hickman H.D. Berglund P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Pan T. Innate immune and chemically triggered oxidative stress modifies translational fidelity.Nature. 2009; 462: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, exposure to hydrogen peroxide causes reduction in the fidelity of translation. This effect has been directly attributed to oxidation of Cys-182 within threonyl-tRNA synthetase, which subsequently impairs the editing ability of the enzyme and results in the production of misaminoacylated Ser-tRNAThr (4.Ling J. Söll D. Severe oxidative stress induces protein mistranslation through impairment of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase editing site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4028-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). How translation quality control is maintained in pneumococci, which are routinely exposed to elevated hydrogen peroxide levels, is unknown. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are the first step in quality control of protein synthesis because they are responsible for amino acid activation and transfer to cognate tRNA (5.Reynolds N.M. Lazazzera B.A. Ibba M. Cellular mechanisms that control mistranslation.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Following this process, the aminoacyl-tRNA is released from the synthetase and bound by elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) 2The abbreviations used are: EF-Tuelongation factor TuAlaRSalanyl-tRNA synthetasePheRSphenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. for delivery to the ribosome and use in protein synthesis (6.Ibba M.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are usually highly selective for their cognate tRNA due to the availability of a large surface area for recognition, identity elements within the tRNA molecule itself, and also kinetic proofreading during the aminoacylation reaction (8.McClain W.H.

Microbiol. 2009; 63: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In contrast, some amino acids are difficult for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to distinguish with high accuracy as they can differ by as little as a single methyl group (11.Fersht A.R. Schimmel P.R. Söll D. Abelson J.N. Editing mechanisms in the aminoacylation of tRNA.in: Transfer RNA: Structure, Properties and Recognition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979: 247-254Google Scholar). For example, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase has difficulty distinguishing between the isosteric amino acids isoleucine and valine, whereas the active site of alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) is able to accommodate alanine, glycine, and serine (12.Eldred E.W. Schimmel P.R. Rapid deacylation by isoleucyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase of isoleucine-specific transfer ribonucleic acid aminoacylated with valine.J. Biol.

Elucidation of tRNA-dependent editing by a class II tRNA synthetase and significance for cell viability.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Misactivation of noncognate serine and glycine by AlaRS occurs at frequencies of 1/500 and 1/250, respectively. This is higher than the overall error rate for translation, which is typically from 1/3000 to 1/10,000 (10.Ling J. Reynolds N. Ibba M. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis and translational quality control.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 61-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Amino acid activation errors can be corrected both by the synthetase itself at a distinct editing site, as is the case for AlaRS, and also by free-standing editing domain homologues, as exemplified by the widely conserved AlaXPs proteins that edit Ser-tRNAAla (17.Guo M. Chong Y.E. Beebe K. Shapiro R. Yang X.L. Schimmel P. The C-Ala domain brings together editing and aminoacylation functions on one tRNA.Science. 2009; 325: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18.Guo M. Chong Y.E. Shapiro R. Beebe K. Yang X.L. Schimmel P. Paradox of mistranslation of serine for alanine caused by AlaRS recognition dilemma.Nature. 2009; 462: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae encodes no known AlaXPs, suggesting that the genes encoding these AlaRS editing domain homologues may have been lost from the pneumococcal genome during gene shuffling, which occurs rapidly within the organism as a result of exposure to antibiotics (19.Croucher N.J. Harris S.R. Fraser C. Quail M.A. Burton J. van der Linden M. McGee L. von Gottberg A. Song J.H. Ko K.S. Pichon B. Baker S. Parry C.M. Lambertsen L.M. Shahinas D. Pillai D.R. Mitchell T.J. Dougan G.

This loss would be feasible in the presence of another conserved protein able to perform the same function. One such candidate protein is MurM, an Ala/Ser-tRNA-dependent aminoacyl-tRNA ligase that is involved in the synthesis of branched structured muropeptides in pneumococcal peptidoglycan (20.Filipe S.R. Severina E. Tomasz A. Distribution of the mosaic structured murM genes among natural populations of Streptococcus pneumoniae.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6798-6805Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MurM catalyzes the transfer of either alanine or serine to the stem peptide lysine of Lipid II and, in combination with MurN, generates the substrate for indirect cross-linking of peptidoglycan. Until recently, the only aminoacyl-tRNA substrates recognized by MurM were thought to be Ser-tRNASer, provided by seryl-tRNA synthetase, and Ala-tRNAAla, provided by AlaRS (38.Lloyd A.J. Gilbey A.M. Blewett A.M. De Pascale G. El Zoeiby A. Levesque R.C. Catherwood A.C. Tomasz A. Bugg T.D. Roper D.I. Dowson C.G.

Chem. 2008; 283: 6402-6417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, MurM is also able to efficiently transfer serine to Lipid II from misaminoacylated Ser-tRNAAla, which is also produced by pneumococcal AlaRS (21.Shepherd, J., (2011) Characterisation of Pneumococcal Peptidoglycan Cross-linking Enzymology. Ph.D. thesis, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom,Google Scholar). The observed preference for misaminoacylated Ser-tRNAAla suggests that MurM could function as a trans editing factor and influence translation quality control by channeling appropriate misaminoacylated tRNA species into the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway. Here we show that pneumococcal AlaRS also misaminoacylates an unusual tRNAPhe isoacceptor to generate substrates for MurM, which is able to catalyze deacylation in the absence of Lipid II. elongation factor Tu alanyl-tRNA synthetase phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. S. pneumoniae strain D39 chromosomal DNA for use as a template in the cloning of AlaRS, PheRS, EF-Tu, and MurM was a gift from B. Lazazzera (University of California, Los Angeles). An expression construct for producing His6-tagged E. coli AlaRS and pUC19 containing the E. coli tRNAAla gene for production by in vitro transcription were gifts from K. Musier-Forsyth (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). The genes encoding S. pneumoniae AlaRS full-length protein, AlaRS residues 1–460 (catalytic domain only), EF-Tu, and MurM were cloned into pET21b (Novagen) by virtue of the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. Subsequent expression constructs allowed for the production of recombinant proteins tagged at the C termini with a hexahistidine tag. The genes encoding S. pneumoniae PheRS α and β subunits were cloned into pET Duet-1 (Novagen) multiple cloning sites one and two, respectively, such that the protein was produced with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. All proteins were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) by the addition of a final concentration of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-1-thigalactopyranoside at an A600 of 04–0.6 followed by a reduction in growth temperature from 37 °C to 28 °C for 3–5 h. Proteins were purified on BD TALON cobalt resin using equilibration/wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 500 mm sodium chloride, and 20% glycerol) containing 250 mm imidazole. MurM was solubilized prior to purification as described (21.Shepherd, J., (2011) Characterisation of Pneumococcal Peptidoglycan Cross-linking Enzymology. Ph.D. thesis, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom,Google Scholar, 38.Lloyd A.J. Gilbey A.M. Blewett A.M. De Pascale G. El Zoeiby A. Levesque R.C. Catherwood A.C. Tomasz A. Bugg T.D.

Chem. 2008; 283: 6402-6417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae tRNAAla and tRNAPhe (wild type and U4G) and the E. coli wild type equivalents were produced by in vitro T7 RNA polymerase runoff transcription as described (22.Roy H. Ling J. Irnov M. Ibba M. Post-transfer editing in vitro and in vivo by the β subunit of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4639-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of pneumococcal tRNAPhe was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction using PfuTurbo polymerase. Methodology was obtained from the Stratagene site-directed mutagenesis manual. Aminoacylation time courses were carried out across a time period of 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 m Na-HEPES, pH 7.2, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 7 μm tRNAAla/Phe transcript, 40 or 110 μm [3H]Ser/[14C]Ala/[14C]Gly (150–200 cpm/pmol), and 310 nm active AlaRS (as determined by active site titration). Reactions were repeated in the presence of 50 nm active S. pneumoniae PheRS, 300 nm S. pneumoniae MurM, or 3 μm activated S. pneumoniae EF-Tu. EF-Tu was activated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, 68 mm KCl, 6.7 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mm GTP, and 30 mg/ml pyruvate kinase as described (23.Ling J. Yadavalli S.S. Ibba M. Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase editing defects result in efficient mistranslation of phenylalanine codons as tyrosine.RNA. 2007; 13: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 10-μl samples were taken for each time point and spotted onto 3-mm Whatman filter paper discs, which were immediately dropped into 5% TCA. Discs were subjected to further washes with 5% TCA and ethanol prior to drying and scintillation counting. To determine Michaelis-Menten kinetics for pneumococcal PheRS with either wild type or mutant U4G tRNAPhe, phenylalanylation time courses were carried out at 37 °C at both the lowest (0.05 μm) and the highest (10.0 μm) tRNA concentration in the presence of 0.1 m Na-HEPES, pH 7.2, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 50 μm [14C]Phe (200 cpm/pmol), and 50 nm active PheRS (as determined by active site titration). Because the linear region was determined to be within the first 2 min, 10-μl samples were spotted onto 3-mm Whatman filter paper and dropped into 5% TCA at four time points (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2 min) at each of the tRNA concentrations (0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.00, 3.00, 5.00, 10.00 μm) for determination of gradients and key kinetic parameters from triplicate data sets. Aminoacylation reactions were set up in four 200-μl reactions each consisting of 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 110 μm [3H]serine or [3H]alanine (with a specific activity of ∼300 cpm/pmol), 10 μm S. pneumoniae tRNAAla transcript (prior to use, stock was resuspended in 4 mm MgCl2 and heated at 80 °C for 10 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature to allow refolding), 2 μmol min−1 ml−1 inorganic pyrophosphatase, and 3 μm alanyl-tRNA synthetase catalytic domain. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then quenched by the addition of 20 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5. [3H]Aminoacyl-tRNA purification was achieved by the addition of 220 μl of phenol, pH 4.5, to each of the four reactions followed by mixing and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was retained, and an equal volume of 24:1 chloroform isoamyl alcohol was added. 550 μl of −20 °C RNase-free ethanol was added to the aqueous phase, which was subsequently incubated at −80 °C for 1 h. The precipitated aminoacyl-tRNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min and washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol. After a final centrifugation step at 13,000 rpm for 30 min, the pellet was dried at room temperature for 5 min and resuspended in 50 μl of 3 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. At this point, all four reactions were pooled, yielding 200 μl of [3H]Ser or [3H]Ala-tRNAAla, the concentration of which was determined by 5% TCA precipitation of 2 μl of the stock and scintillation counting. Deacylation assays were carried out by incubation of 50 pm [3H]Ser or Ala-tRNAAla in buffer composed of 0.1 m Na-HEPES, pH 7.2, 30 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. In addition, 0.5 μm AlaRS, 0.5 μm MurM, or an equal volume of protein storage buffer was added to the reaction, which was monitored by TCA precipitation and scintillation counting. Due to our inability to successfully isolate sufficient yields of misaminoacylated tRNAPhe, an aminoacylation-coupled deacylation reaction was developed. 100-μl aminoacylation reactions were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 m Na-HEPES, pH 7.2, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 7 μm tRNAAla/Phe transcript, 100 μm [3H]Ser (PerkinElmer)/[3H]Ala (Moravek Biochemicals) at a specific activity of 200–300 cpm/pmol, and 0.5–1.0 μm active AlaRS catalytic domain (or full-length AlaRS in the case of cognate Ala-tRNAAla). After a 1-h incubation, sodium chloride (final concentration 100 mm) and adenosine 5′-triphosphatase from porcine cerebral cortex (final concentration of 0.5 units, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the reaction. Incubation at 37 °C was continued for an additional 30 min to the plateau of aminoacylation prior to the addition of the potential deacylation factor (enzyme storage buffer in the case of the control, full-length AlaRS, PheRS, or MurM) in a 34-μl volume where 4 μl was composed entirely of 100 mm unlabeled serine or alanine as appropriate. After equilibration for 2 min, a 10-μl volume was taken from the reaction and spotted onto 3-mm Whatman filter paper, which was immediately dropped into 5% TCA. This was used as the zero time point, and the deacylation reaction was monitored for an additional 10 min with samples taken at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 10 min. After all time points had been taken, filter papers were washed a further two times in 5% TCA and then once in 100% ethanol prior to drying and liquid scintillation counting. All samples were repeated in triplicate. Full-length AlaRS, PheRS, and MurM were at final concentrations of 0.6, 1, and 1 μm, respectively. The ability of AlaRS to misactivate both serine and glycine is well documented, as is its high specificity for cognate tRNAAla, which results from recognition of the conserved G3:U70 base pair in the acceptor stem (14.Tsui W.C.

Schimmel P. A simple structural feature is a major determinant of the identity of a transfer RNA.Nature. 1988; 333: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The potential ability of pneumococcal AlaRS to utilize noncognate tRNAPhe as a substrate was investigated here due to the presence of an unusual U4:C69 mismatch within the acceptor stem of the molecule, which may affect the ability of AlaRS to accurately discriminate against it (Fig. 1). In vitro assays showed that pneumococcal AlaRS was able to aminoacylate both tRNAAla and tRNAPhe with any of Ala, Gly, or Ser (Fig. 2). As expected, an equivalent active concentration of the isolated catalytic domain of AlaRS, which has no editing function, was more efficient in tRNA misaminoacylation than the full-length editing-proficient enzyme (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Error-prone aminoacylation of tRNAAla and tRNAPhe by full-length pneumococcal AlaRS.

E. coli AlaRS does not use tRNAPhe as a substrate, consistent with the absence of either the G3:U70 alanylation identity element or other atypical structures such as the U4:C69 mismatch present in S. pneumoniae tRNAPhe (Fig. 1). Previous studies have indicated that mutation of E. coli tRNAPhe to contain the G3:U70 identity element is required for aminoacylation by E. coli AlaRS (24.Hou Y.M. Schimmel P. A simple structural feature is a major determinant of the identity of a transfer RNA.Nature. 1988; 333: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The ability of pneumococcal PheRS to aminoacylate both wild type pneumococcal tRNAPhe and mutant tRNAPheU4G was tested. In the later species, the distorted region of the acceptor stem was replaced by a Watson-Crick base pair conformation, making the structure more closely resemble that of E. coli tRNAPhe (Fig. 1). The tRNAPheU4G mutant was aminoacylated ∼5-fold more efficiently than the wild type species by PheRS (Fig. 4A), whereas full-length AlaRS was able to alanylate both tRNAs equally efficiently (Fig. 4B). Kinetic characterization of PheRS with both wild type and mutant tRNAPhe indicated that this effect was not caused by a change in Km but rather by an approximate 2.5-fold increase in kcat for tRNAPheU4G (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for phenylalanylation of tRNAPhe wild type of U4G by PheRSKmVmaxkcatkcat/Kmμmμm/min/mgs−1Wild type tRNAPhe1.05 ± 0.190.15 ± 0.040.32 ± 0.090.30Mutant tRNAPheU4G1.09 ± 0.300.38 ± 0.060.78 ± 0.100.72 Open table in a new tab To test whether pneumococcal PheRS could hydrolyze misaminoacylated Ala-, Ser-, and Gly-tRNAPhe, AlaRS-catalyzed misaminoacylation reactions were repeated in the presence of PheRS (Fig. 4, C–E). PheRS addition caused a marked enhancement of Ala-tRNAPhe production by pneumococcal AlaRS, suggesting that PheRS binds and protects this misaminoacylated tRNA from spontaneous deacylation (Fig. 4C). Some protection was also demonstrated for Gly-tRNAPhe (Fig. 4E) but not for Ser-tRNAPhe (Fig. 4D). In the absence of a successful procedure for isolating adequate yields of misaminoacylated tRNAPhe, a coupled aminoacylation/deacylation assay was developed to assess the ability of PheRS to edit both wild type and mutant Ala- and Ser-tRNAPhe. PheRS addition had no effect on the deacylation of either Ser-tRNAPhe species (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). For Ala-tRNAPhe, PheRS addition led to deacylation of Ala-tRNAPheU4G but not wild type Ala-tRNAPhe (Fig. 5, D and C, respectively). This suggests that the U4:C69 mismatch in wild type pneumococcal tRNAPhe is an anti-determinant for PheRS-mediated editing of Ala-tRNAPhe. The sequence of pneumococcal EF-Tu is diverged from that of other bacteria at four conserved positions: P129K, M140L, T230S, and E234D. Of particular interest is the substitution of Thr-230 with Ser in the third β strand of the second domain of the protein, which comprises the aminoacyl-tRNA binding pocket (25.Ke D. Boissinot M. Huletsky A. Picard F.J. Frenette J. Ouellette M. Roy P.H. Bergeron M.G. Evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor Tu in enterococci.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6913-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The effects of pneumococcal EF-Tu addition on the generation of misaminoacylated tRNAAla and tRNAPhe by AlaRS were investigated. EF-Tu addition resulted in modest enhancement of the production of Gly-tRNAAla by pneumococcal AlaRS (Fig. 6) but had no significant effect on other AlaRS-catalyzed reactions (data not shown). Pneumococcal peptidoglycan is unusual in that it typically consists of a combination of both branched and linear muropeptides. Within the structure, branched muropeptides consist of either a serine-alanine or an alanine-alanine dipeptide bridge attached to the stem peptide lysine of Lipid II. This dipeptide bridge is synthesized by the action of the MurM and MurN proteins (26.Fiser A. Filipe S.R. Tomasz A.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The substrates for MurM include pneumococcal Ser-tRNASer and Ala-tRNAAla provided by seryl-tRNA synthetase and AlaRS, respectively. Previous work also demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of MurM is greater when Ser-tRNAAla is provided as a substrate as opposed to Ala-tRNAAla (21.Shepherd, J., (2011) Characterisation of Pneumococcal Peptidoglycan Cross-linking Enzymology. Ph.D. thesis, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom,Google Scholar). The ability of MurM to utilize Ser-tRNAAla and the absence of any genome-encoded AlaXPs proteins in S. pneumoniae prompted us to investigate the ability of MurM to trans edit mischarged tRNAs. In the case of AlaRS synthesis of Ser-tRNAAla, the addition of MurM suppressed mischarging for the first 15 min of the reaction (Fig. 7A). After this time, product formation increased, possibly due to a loss of MurM stability during incubation for prolonged time periods at 37 °C. The initial suppression of mischarging suggests that MurM may act as a trans editing factor capable of hydrolyzing Ser-tRNAAla in the absence of its second substrate, Lipid II. AlaRS generation of Ala-tRNAPhe was also reduced by the addition of MurM to the mischarging time course, providing additional support for a trans editing function (Fig. 7E). The ability of MurM to hydrolyze Ser-tRNAAla and Ala-tRNAAla was investigated in the absence of Lipid II (Fig. 8, A and B, respectively). The addition of MurM led to rapid deacylation of both Ala-tRNAAla and Ser-tRNAAla, consistent with trans editing activity. Direct deacylation assays could not be performed with MurM and Ala-tRNAPhe due to the comparative instability of this mischarged tRNA species (see above).FIGURE 8Deacylation of mischarged pneumococcal tRNAAla by MurM. A and B, deacylation time courses were carried out as described by incubation of 50 pm [3H]Ser-tRNAAla (A) or Ala-tRNAAla (B) with 0.5 μm pneumococcal AlaRS or 0.5 μm MurM.

Association of transfer RNA acceptor identity with a helical irregularity.Science. 1988; 242: 1681-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to this, it has been demonstrated that E. coli tRNAPhe can only be alanylated by E. coli AlaRS if the acceptor stem is mutated so that it contains the G3:U70 base pair (24.Hou Y.M. Schimmel P. A simple structural feature is a major determinant of the identity of a transfer RNA.Nature. 1988; 333: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 29.McClain W.H. Foss K. Changing the acceptor identity of a transfer RNA by altering nucleotides in a “variable pocket”.Science. 1988; 241: 1804-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The predicted cloverleaf structure of pneumococcal tRNAPhe indicates the presence of an unusual wobble base pair in its acceptor stem, U4:C69, which is not found in E. coli tRNAPhe (Fig. 1) (33.Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. tRNAscan-SE: a program for improved detection of transfer RNA genes in genomic sequence.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (8182) Google Scholar, 34.Schattner P.

In addition to misaminoacylating tRNAAla, pneumococcal AlaRS is also able to charge tRNAPhe with alanine, serine, and glycine. Production of high levels of hydrogen peroxide during the life cycle of pneumococcus could potentially accelerate misaminoacylation of tRNAAla and tRNAPhe by AlaRS. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that exposure of E. coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase to hydrogen peroxide results in exacerbated production of misaminoacylated Ser-tRNAThr. This is due to oxidation of an editing site cysteine residue and subsequent loss of zinc ion coordination (4.Ling J. Söll D. Severe oxidative stress induces protein mistranslation through impairment of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase editing site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4028-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the absence of free-standing homologues of the editing domain of AlaRS (AlaXPs proteins), pneumococcus may require MurM to maintain translation quality control, particularly if tRNA mischarging is elevated under oxidative stress as has been previously observed in other organisms (3.Netzer N. Goodenbour J.M. David A. Dittmar K.A. Jones R.B. Schneider J.R. Boone D. Eves E.M. Rosner M.R. Gibbs J.S. Embry A. Dolan B. Das S. Hickman H.D. Berglund P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Pan T.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 4028-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The peptidoglycan structure of pneumococcus is particularly unusual in that it contains a combination of both branched and linear muropeptides. The MurMN proteins are responsible for the synthesis of branched muropeptides and are one of the requirements for high level penicillin resistance within this bacterium (27.Filipe S.R. Tomasz A. Inhibition of the expression of penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae by inactivation of cell wall muropeptide branching genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 4891-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28.Filipe S.R. Severina E. Tomasz A. The murMN operon: a functional link between antibiotic resistance and antibiotic tolerance in Streptococcus pneumoniae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanisms used by pneumococcus to ensure sufficient division of aminoacylated tRNA species between peptidoglycan biosynthesis and protein synthesis are of great interest. In Staphylococcus aureus, pentaglycine bridge formation is essential for cell viability and is catalyzed by the Gly-tRNAGly requiring FemXAB proteins (35.Ling B. Berger-Bächi B. Increased overall antibiotic susceptibility in Staphylococcus aureus femAB null mutants.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 936-938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. aureus, four annotated tRNAGly isoacceptors have been identified in addition to a pseudogene encoding an unusual fifth tRNAGly isoacceptor. Although all five tRNAGly isoacceptors have been shown to be substrates for the S. aureus glycyl-tRNA synthetase, the pseudogene and two of the other tRNAGly isoacceptors with the same anticodon were shown to possess sequence identity elements favoring weak binding interaction with EF-Tu. This allows S. aureus to ensure proper division of Gly-tRNAGly between protein synthesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis (36.Giannouli S. Kyritsis A. Malissovas N. Becker H.D. Stathopoulos C. On the role of an unusual tRNAGly isoacceptor in Staphylococcus aureus.Biochimie. 2009; 91: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In pneumococcus, no unique tRNAAla or tRNASer isoacceptors have been identified that would enable the bacterium to achieve division of aminoacylated tRNA between protein synthesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis in the same way S. aureus does. The inability of pneumococcal PheRS to edit misaminoacylated Ala- and Ser-tRNAPhe may ensure that these species are potential cellular substrates for the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway. This is supported by the finding that the mismatch within the acceptor stem of pneumococcal tRNAPhe may allow AlaRS to compete with PheRS for this substrate by compromising the aminoacylation activity of the latter protein. Our data suggest that, once released from AlaRS, misaminoacylated tRNA species can be hydrolytically cleaved by MurM, but it remains unclear whether they are specifically diverted away from the translation machinery as is the case for some forms of Gly-tRNAGly in S. aureus. Further characterization of these and other adaptations pneumococci have made to ensure that the fidelity of protein synthesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis are maintained during antibiotic and oxidative stress may enable new drug targets to be identified in the future. This has the potential to result in subsequent restoration of the potency of penicillin in the treatment of infections by this bacterium. We thank Drs. Karin Musier-Forsyth and Beth Lazazzera for gifts of materials."
https://openalex.org/W2063077885,"Subunit a plays a key role in promoting H(+) transport-coupled rotary motion of the subunit c ring in F1Fo ATP synthase. H(+) binding and release occur at Asp-61 in the middle of the second transmembrane helix (TMH) of Fo subunit c. H(+) are thought to reach cAsp61 via aqueous half-channels formed by TMHs 2-5 of subunit a. Movements of TMH4 and TMH5 have been proposed to facilitate protonation of cAsp61 from a half channel centered in a four helix bundle at the periplasmic side of subunit a. The possible necessity of these proposed TMH movements was investigated by assaying ATP driven H(+) pumping function before and after cross-linking paired Cys substitutions at the center of TMHs within subunit a. The cross-linking of the Cys pairs aG218C/I248C in TMH4 and TMH5, and aL120C/H245C in TMH2 and TMH5, inhibited H(+) pumping by 85-90%. H(+) pumping function was largely unaffected by modification of the same Cys residues in the absence of cross-link formation. The inhibition is consistent with the proposed requirement for TMH movements during the gating of periplasmic H(+) access to cAsp61. The cytoplasmic loops of subunit a have been implicated in gating H(+) release to the cytoplasm, and previous cross-linking experiments suggest that the chemically reactive regions of the loops may pack as a single domain. Here we show that Cys substitutions in these domains can be cross-linked with retention of function and conclude that these domains need not undergo large conformational changes during enzyme function."
https://openalex.org/W2013551017,"AAA ATPases form a functionally diverse superfamily of proteins. Most members form homo-hexameric ring complexes, are catalytically active only in the fully assembled state, and show co-operativity among the six subunits. The mutual dependence among the subunits is clearly evidenced by the fact that incorporation of mutated, inactive subunits can decrease the activity of the remaining wild type subunits. For the first time, we develop here models to describe this form of allostery, evaluate them in a simulation study, and test them on experimental data. We show that it is important to consider the assembly reactions in the kinetic model, and to define a formal inhibition scheme. We simulate three inhibition scenarios explicitly, and demonstrate that they result in differing outcomes. Finally, we deduce fitting formulas, and test them on real and simulated data. A non-competitive inhibition formula fitted experimental and simulated data best. To our knowledge, our study is the first one that derives and tests formal allosteric schemes to explain the inhibitory effects of mutant subunits on oligomeric enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2085992218,"Antibiotic resistance has been reported since the introduction of synthetic antibiotics. Bacteria, such as one of the most common nosocomial pathogens P. aeruginosa, adapt quickly to changing environmental conditions, due to their short generation time. Thus microevolutional changes can be monitored in situ. In this study, the microevolutional process of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 resistance against a recently developed novel antibacterial zinc Schiff-base (ZSB) was investigated at the proteome level. After extended exposure to ZSB the passaged strain differed in tolerance against ZSB, with the adapted P. aeruginosa PAO1 exhibiting 1.6 times higher minimal inhibitory concentration. Using Two-dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis, the changes in the proteome of ZSB adapted P. aeruginosa PAO1 were examined by comparison with the non-adapted P. aeruginosa PAO1. The proteome of the adapted P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain differed significantly from the non-adapted in the abundance of two proteins when both strains were grown under stressing conditions. One protein could be identified as the outer membrane protein D that plays a role in uptake of basic amino acids as well as in carbapeneme resistance. The second protein has been identified as alkyl peroxide reductase subunit F. Our data indicated a slight increase in abundance of alkyl peroxide reductase F (AhpF) in the case of ZSB passaged P. aeruginosa PAO1. Higher abundance of Ahp has been discussed in the literature as a promoter of accelerated detoxification of benzene derivatives. The observed up-regulated AhpF thus appears to be connected to an increased tolerance against ZSB. Changes in the abundance of proteins connected to oxidative stress were also found after short-time exposure of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to the ZSB. Furthermore, adapted P. aeruginosa PAO1 showed increased tolerance against hydrogen peroxide and, in addition, showed accelerated degradation of ZSB, as determined by HPLC measurements."
