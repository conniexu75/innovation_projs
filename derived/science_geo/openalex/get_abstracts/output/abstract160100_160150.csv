https://openalex.org/W2131282078,"Large numbers of new neurons are born continuously in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ). The molecular niche of SVZ stem cells is poorly understood. Here, we show that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist Noggin is expressed by ependymal cells adjacent to the SVZ. SVZ cells were found to express BMPs as well as their cognate receptors. BMPs potently inhibited neurogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. BMP signaling cell-autonomously blocked the production of neurons by SVZ precursors by directing glial differentiation. Purified mouse Noggin protein promoted neurogenesis in vitro and inhibited glial cell differentiation. Ectopic Noggin promoted neuronal differentiation of SVZ cells grafted to the striatum. We thus propose that ependymal Noggin production creates a neurogenic environment in the adjacent SVZ by blocking endogenous BMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1991690400,"The small GTPase Ran, bound to GTP, is required for the induction of spindle formation by chromosomes in M phase. High concentrations of Ran.GTP are proposed to surround M phase chromatin. We show that the action of Ran.GTP in spindle formation requires TPX2, a microtubule-associated protein previously known to target a motor protein, Xklp2, to microtubules. TPX2 is normally inactivated by binding to the nuclear import factor, importin alpha, and is displaced from importin alpha by the action of Ran.GTP. TPX2 is required for Ran.GTP and chromatin-induced microtubule assembly in M phase extracts and mediates spontaneous microtubule assembly when present in excess over free importin alpha. Thus, components of the nuclear transport machinery serve to regulate spindle formation in M phase."
https://openalex.org/W2004864721,"XRCC1 protein is required for DNA single-strand break repair and genetic stability but its biochemical role is unknown. Here, we report that XRCC1 interacts with human polynucleotide kinase in addition to its established interactions with DNA polymerase-beta and DNA ligase III. Moreover, these four proteins are coassociated in multiprotein complexes in human cell extract and together they repair single-strand breaks typical of those induced by reactive oxygen species and ionizing radiation. Strikingly, XRCC1 stimulates the DNA kinase and DNA phosphatase activities of polynucleotide kinase at damaged DNA termini and thereby accelerates the overall repair reaction. These data identify a novel pathway for mammalian single-strand break repair and demonstrate a concerted role for XRCC1 and PNK in the initial step of processing damaged DNA ends."
https://openalex.org/W2028226828,"Analysis of presynaptic determinants of synaptic strength has been difficult at cortical synapses, mainly due to the lack of direct access to presynaptic elements. Here we report patch-clamp recordings from mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) in rat hippocampal slices. The presynaptic action potential is very short during low-frequency stimulation but is prolonged up to 3-fold during high-frequency stimulation. Voltage-gated K(+) channels in MFBs inactivate rapidly but recover from inactivation very slowly, suggesting that cumulative K(+) channel inactivation mediates activity-dependent spike broadening. Prolongation of the presynaptic voltage waveform leads to an increase in the number of Ca(2+) ions entering the terminal per action potential and to a consecutive potentiation of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents at MFB-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses. Thus, inactivation of presynaptic K(+) channels contributes to the control of efficacy of a glutamatergic synapse in the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2022613290,"Visual perception of houses, faces, and chairs evoke differential responses in ventral temporal cortex. Using fMRI, we compared activations evoked by perception and imagery of these object categories. We found content-related activation during imagery in extrastriate cortex, but this activity was restricted to small subsets of the regions that showed category-related activation during perception. Within ventral temporal cortex, activation during imagery evoked stronger responses on the left whereas perception evoked stronger responses on the right. Additionally, visual imagery evoked activity in parietal and frontal cortex, but this activity was not content related. These results suggest that content-related activation during imagery in visual extrastriate cortex may be implemented by ""top-down"" mechanisms in parietal and frontal cortex that mediate the retrieval of face and object representations from long-term memory and their maintenance through visual imagery."
https://openalex.org/W2005019117,"Photoreceptor cells utilize ribbon synapses to transmit sensory signals at high resolution. Ribbon synapses release neurotransmitters tonically, with a high release rate made possible by continuous docking of synaptic vesicles on presynaptic ribbons. We have partially purified synaptic ribbons from retina and identified a major protein component called RIBEYE. RIBEYE is composed of a unique A domain specific for ribbons, and a B domain identical with CtBP2, a transcriptional repressor that in turn is related to 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases. The A domain mediates assembly of RIBEYE into large structures, whereas the B domain binds NAD(+) with high affinity, similar to 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases. Our results define a unique component of synaptic ribbons and suggest that RIBEYE evolved in vertebrates under utilization of a preexisting protein to build a unique scaffold for a specialized synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2036623899,"Mutations in mammalian Lis1 (Pafah1b1) result in neuronal migration defects. Several lines of evidence suggest that LIS1 participates in pathways regulating microtubule function, but the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that LIS1 directly interacts with the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (CDHC) and NUDEL, a murine homolog of the Aspergillus nidulans nuclear migration mutant NudE. LIS1 and NUDEL colocalize predominantly at the centrosome in early neuroblasts but redistribute to axons in association with retrograde dynein motor proteins. NUDEL is phosphorylated by Cdk5/p35, a complex essential for neuronal migration. NUDEL and LIS1 regulate the distribution of CDHC along microtubules, and establish a direct functional link between LIS1, NUDEL, and microtubule motors. These results suggest that LIS1 and NUDEL regulate CDHC activity during neuronal migration and axonal retrograde transport in a Cdk5/p35-dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2037835429,"Disruption of one allele of the LIS1 gene causes a severe developmental brain abnormality, type I lissencephaly. In Aspergillus nidulans, the LIS1 homolog, NUDF, and cytoplasmic dynein are genetically linked and regulate nuclear movements during hyphal growth. Recently, we demonstrated that mammalian LIS1 regulates dynein functions. Here we characterize NUDEL, a novel LIS1-interacting protein with sequence homology to gene products also implicated in nuclear distribution in fungi. Like LIS1, NUDEL is robustly expressed in brain, enriched at centrosomes and neuronal growth cones, and interacts with cytoplasmic dynein. Furthermore, NUDEL is a substrate of Cdk5, a kinase known to be critical during neuronal migration. Inhibition of Cdk5 modifies NUDEL distribution in neurons and affects neuritic morphology. Our findings point to cross-talk between two prominent pathways that regulate neuronal migration."
https://openalex.org/W2070516871,"Acetylation of histones by p300/CBP and PCAF is considered to be a critical step in transcriptional regulation. In order to understand the role of cellular activities that modulate histone acetylation and transcription, we have purified and characterized a multiprotein cellular complex that potently inhibits the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP and PCAF. We have mapped a novel acetyltransferase-inhibitory domain of this INHAT (inhibitor of acetyltransferases) complex that binds to histones and masks them from being acetyltransferase substrates. Endogenous INHAT subunits, which include the Set/TAF-Ibeta oncoprotein, associate with chromatin in vivo and can block coactivatormediated transcription when transfected in cells. We propose that histone masking by INHAT plays a regulatory role in chromatin modification and serves as a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1986425636,"Postembryonic development of plants depends on the activity of apical meristems established during embryogenesis. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) and the root apical meristem (RAM) have similar but distinct cellular organization. Arabidopsis FASCIATA1 (FAS1) and FAS2 genes maintain the cellular and functional organization of both SAM and RAM, and FAS gene products are subunits of the Arabidopsis counterpart of chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1). fas mutants are defective in maintenance of the expression states of WUSCHEL (WUS) in SAM and SCARECROW (SCR) in RAM. We suggest that CAF-1 plays a critical role in the organization of SAM and RAM during postembryonic development by facilitating stable maintenance of gene expression states."
https://openalex.org/W2018626472,Tight junctions in the cochlear duct are thought to compartmentalize endolymph and provide structural support for the auditory neuroepithelium. The claudin family of genes is known to express protein components of tight junctions in other tissues. The essential function of one of these claudins in the inner ear was established by identifying mutations in CLDN14 that cause nonsyndromic recessive deafness DFNB29 in two large consanguineous Pakistani families. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated mouse claudin-14 expression in the sensory epithelium of the organ of Corti.
https://openalex.org/W2089178397,"Anatomical rearrangement of retinogeniculate connections contributes to the refinement of synaptic circuits in the developing visual system, but the underlying changes in synaptic function are unclear. Here, we study such changes in mouse brain slices. Each geniculate cell receives a surprisingly large number of retinal inputs (>20) well after eye-specific zones are formed. All but one to three of these inputs are eliminated over a 3-week period spanning eye opening. Remaining inputs are strengthened approximately 50-fold, in part through an increase in quantal size, but primarily through an increase in the number of release sites. Changes in release probability do not contribute significantly. Thus, a redistribution of release sites from many inputs to few inputs at this late developmental stage contributes to the precise receptive fields of thalamic relay neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1985768427,"Unlike cone photoreceptors, whose light responses have a uniform time course, retinal ganglion cells are tuned to respond to different temporal components in a changing visual scene. The signals in a mammalian cone flow to three to five morphologically distinct ""OFF"" bipolar cells at a sign-conserving, glutamatergic synapse. By recording simultaneously from pairs of synaptically connected cones and OFF bipolar cells, I now show that each morphological type of OFF bipolar cell receives its signal through a different AMPA or kainate receptor. The characteristic rate at which each receptor recovers from desensitization divides the cone signal into temporal components. Temporal processing begins at the first synapse in the visual system."
https://openalex.org/W1999081109,"The GTPase Ran has recently been shown to stimulate microtubule polymerization in mitotic extracts, but its mode of action is not understood. Here we show that the mitotic role of Ran is largely mediated by the nuclear transport factor importin β. Importin β inhibits spindle formation in vitro and in vivo and sequesters an aster promoting activity (APA) that consists of multiple, independent factors. One component of APA is the microtubule-associated protein NuMA. NuMA and other APA components are discharged from importin β by RanGTP and induce spindle-like structures in the absence of centrosomes, chromatin, or Ran. We propose that RanGTP functions in mitosis as in interphase by locally releasing cargoes from transport factors. In mitosis, this promotes spindle assembly by organizing microtubules in the vicinity of chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1965745028,"We combined fMRI and EEG recording to study the neurophysiological responses associated with auditory stimulation across the sleep-wake cycle. We found that presentation of auditory stimuli produces bilateral activation in auditory cortex, thalamus, and caudate during both wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. However, the left parietal and, bilaterally, the prefrontal and cingulate cortices and the thalamus were less activated during NREM sleep compared to wakefulness. These areas may play a role in the further processing of sensory information required to achieve conscious perception during wakefulness. Finally, during NREM sleep, the left amygdala and the left prefrontal cortex were more activated by stimuli having special affective significance than by neutral stimuli. These data suggests that the sleeping brain can process auditory stimuli and detect meaningful events."
https://openalex.org/W2069220164,"Fertilization and zygote development are obligate features of the malaria parasite life cycle and occur during parasite transmission to mosquitoes. The surface protein PFS48/45 is expressed by male and female gametes of Plasmodium falciparum and PFS48/45 antibodies prevent zygote development and transmission. Here, gene disruption was used to show that Pfs48/45 and the ortholog Pbs48/45 from a rodent malaria parasite P. berghei play a conserved and important role in fertilization. p48/45− parasites had a reduced capacity to produce oocysts in mosquitoes due to greatly reduced zygote formation. Unexpectedly, only male gamete fertility of p48/45− parasites was affected, failing to penetrate otherwise fertile female gametes. P48/45 is shown to be a surface protein of malaria parasites with a demonstrable role in fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2060202251,"The NMDA receptor NR1 subunit has four splice variants that differ in their C-terminal, cytoplasmic domain. We investigated the contribution of the C-terminal cassettes, C0, C1, C2, and C2', to trafficking of NR1 in heterologous cells and neurons. We identified an ER retention signal (RRR) in the C1 cassette of NR1, which is similar to the RXR motif in ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (Zerangue et al., 1999). We found that surface expression of NR1-3, which contains C1, is due to a site on the C2' cassette, which includes the terminal 4 amino acid PDZ-interacting domain. This site suppresses ER retention of the C1 cassette and leads to surface expression. These findings suggest a role for PDZ proteins in facilitating the transition of receptors from an intracellular pool to the surface of the neuron."
https://openalex.org/W2023195093,"GABAergic interneurons have major roles in hippocampal function and dysfunction. Here we provide evidence that, in mice, virtually all of these cells originate from progenitors in the basal telencephalon. Immature interneurons tangentially migrate from the basal telencephalon through the neocortex to take up their final positions in the hippocampus. Disrupting differentiation in the embryonic basal telencephalon (lateral and medial ganglionic eminences) through loss of Dlx1/2 homeobox function blocks the migration of virtually all GABAergic interneurons to the hippocampus. On the other hand, disrupting specification of the medial ganglionic eminence through loss of Nkx2.1 homeobox function depletes the hippocampus of a distinct subset of hippocampal interneurons. Loss of hippocampal interneurons does not appear to have major effects on the early development of hippocampal projection neurons nor on the pathfinding of afferrent tracts."
https://openalex.org/W2020476760,"We investigated the role of PDZ proteins (GRIP, ABP, and PICK1) interacting with the C-terminal GluR2 by infusing a ct-GluR2 peptide (“pep2-SVKI”) into CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices using whole-cell recordings. Pep2-SVKI, but not a control or PICK1 selective peptide, caused AMPAR-mediated EPSC amplitude to increase in approximately one-third of control neurons and in most neurons following the prior induction of LTD. Pep2-SVKI also blocked LTD; however, this occurred in all neurons. A PKC inhibitor prevented these effects of pep2-SVKI on synaptic transmission and LTD. We propose a model in which the maintenance of LTD involves the binding of AMPARs to PDZ proteins to prevent their reinsertion. We also present evidence that PKC regulates AMPAR reinsertion during dedepression."
https://openalex.org/W2000994765,"Type III secretion for injection of effector proteins into host cells has not been described for Gram-positive bacteria despite their importance in disease. Here, we describe an injection pathway for the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes that utilizes streptolysin O (SLO), a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin. The data support a model in which an effector is translocated through the SLO pore by a polarized process. The effector, SPN (S. pyogenes NAD-glycohydrolase), is capable of producing the potent second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose, and SLO and SPN act synergistically to trigger cytotoxicity. These data provide a novel paradigm for the function of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family and its wide distribution suggests that cytolysin-mediated translocation (CMT) may be the equivalent of type III secretion for Gram-positive pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2067890396,"LIS1, a microtubule-associated protein, is required for neuronal migration, but the precise mechanism of LIS1 function is unknown. We identified a LIS1 interacting protein encoded by a mouse homolog of NUDE, a nuclear distribution gene in A. nidulans and a multicopy suppressor of the LIS1 homolog, NUDF. mNudE is located in the centrosome or microtubule organizing center (MTOC), and interacts with six different centrosomal proteins. Overexpression of mNudE dissociates gamma-tubulin from the centrosome and disrupts microtubule organization. Missense mutations that disrupt LIS1 function block LIS1-mNudE binding. Moreover, misexpression of the LIS1 binding domain of mNudE in Xenopus embryos disrupts the architecture and lamination of the CNS. Thus, LIS1-mNudE interactions may regulate neuronal migration through dynamic reorganization of the MTOC."
https://openalex.org/W2096059852,"Neuronal process remodeling occurs widely in the construction of both invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems. During Drosophila metamorphosis, gamma neurons of the mushroom bodies (MBs), the center for olfactory learning in insects, undergo pruning of larval-specific dendrites and axons followed by outgrowth of adult-specific processes. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we conducted a genetic mosaic screen and identified one ultraspiracle (usp) allele defective in larval process pruning. Consistent with the notion that USP forms a heterodimer with the ecdysone receptor (EcR), we found that the EcR-B1 isoform is specifically expressed in the MB gamma neurons, and is required for the pruning of larval processes. Surprisingly, most identified primary EcR/USP targets are dispensable for MB neuronal remodeling. Our study demonstrates cell-autonomous roles for EcR/USP in controlling neuronal remodeling, potentially through novel downstream targets."
https://openalex.org/W1967972966,"The von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene (VHL) targets hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-α subunits for ubiquitin dependent proteolysis. To better understand the role of this and other putative pathways of gene regulation in VHL function we subjected mRNA from VHL defective renal carcinoma cells and transfectants re-expressing a wild type VHL allele to differential expression profiling, and analysed VHL target genes for oxygen regulated expression. Among a group of newly identified VHL target genes the majority but not all were regulated by oxygen, indicating that whilst dysregulation of the HIF system makes a dominant contribution to alterations in transcription, VHL has other influences on patterns of gene expression. Genes newly defined as targets of the VHL/hypoxia pathway (conditionally downregulated by VHL in normoxic cells) include aminopeptidase A, collagen type V, alpha 1, cyclin G2, DEC1/Stra13, endothelin 1, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, MIC2/CD99, and transglutaminase 2. These genes have a variety of functions relevant to tumour biology. However, not all are connected with the promotion of tumour growth, some being pro-apoptotic or growth inhibitory. We postulate that co-ordinate regulation as part of the HIF pathway may explain this paradox, and that evolution of anti-apoptotic pathways may be required for tumour growth under VHL-dysregulation. Our results indicate that it will be necessary to consider the effects of abnormal activity in integral regulatory pathways, as well as the effects of individual genes to understand the role of abnormal patterns of gene expression in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2016815862,"Previous studies showed that Roundabout (Robo) in Drosophila is a repulsive axon guidance receptor that binds to Slit, a repellent secreted by midline glia. In robo mutants, growth cones cross and recross the midline, while, in slit mutants, growth cones enter the midline but fail to leave it. This difference suggests that Slit must have more than one receptor controlling midline guidance. In the absence of Robo, some other Slit receptor ensures that growth cones do not stay at the midline, even though they cross and recross it. Here we show that the Drosophila genome encodes three Robo receptors and that Robo and Robo2 have distinct functions, which together control repulsive axon guidance at the midline. The robo,robo2 double mutant is largely identical to slit."
https://openalex.org/W2077814219,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) bind agonists in a domain that has been crystallized and shown to have a bilobed structure. Eukaryotic iGluRs also possess a second extracellular N-terminal domain related to the bacterial periplasmic binding protein LIVBP. In NMDA receptors, the high-affinity Zn inhibition is eliminated by mutations in the LIVBP-like domain of the NR2A subunit. Using LIVBP structure, we have modeled this domain as two lobes connected by a hinge and show that six residues controlling Zn inhibition form two clusters facing each other across a central cleft. Upon Zn binding the two lobes close tightly around the divalent cation. Thus, the extracellular region of NR2A consists of a tandem of Venus flytrap domains, one binding the agonist and the other a modulatory ligand. Such a functional organization may apply to other eukaryotic iGluRs."
https://openalex.org/W2024966724,"Two vesicle pools, readily releasable (RRP) and reserve (RP) pools, are present at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions. Using a temperature-sensitive mutant, shibirets, we studied pool sizes and vesicle mobilization rates. In shibirets, due to lack of endocytosis at nonpermissive temperatures, synaptic currents continuously declined during tetanic stimulation until they ceased as the result of vesicle depletion. By then, ∼84,000 quanta were released. Vesicles were mobilized from RP at a rate 1/7–1/10 of RRP. Cytochalasin D inhibited mobilization of vesicles from RP, allowing us to estimate the size of RRP as 14%–19% of all vesicles. Vesicle recycling supports synaptic transmission during prolonged tetanic stimulation and the maximum recycling rate was 1000 vesicles/s."
https://openalex.org/W2020035925,"In the Drosophila CNS, the midline repellent Slit acts at short range through its receptor Robo to control midline crossing. Longitudinal axons express high levels of Robo and avoid the midline; commissural axons that cross the midline express only low levels of Robo. Robo levels are in turn regulated by Comm. Here, we show that the Slit receptors Robo2 and Robo3 ensure the fidelity of this crossing decision: rare crossing errors occur in both robo2 and robo3 single mutants. In addition, low levels of either Robo or Robo2 are required to drive commissural axons through the midline: only in robo,robo2 double mutants do axons linger at the midline as they do in slit mutants. Robo2 and Robo3 levels are also tightly regulated, most likely by a mechanism similar to but distinct from the regulation of Robo by Comm."
https://openalex.org/W2086582835,"Axon pathfinding relies on the ability of the growth cone to detect and interpret guidance cues and to modulate cytoskeletal changes in response to these signals. We report that the murine POU domain transcription factor Brn-3.2 regulates pathfinding in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at multiple points along their pathways and the establishment of topographic order in the superior colliculus. Using representational difference analysis, we identified Brn-3.2 gene targets likely to act on axon guidance at the levels of transcription, cell-cell interaction, and signal transduction, including the actin-binding LIM domain protein abLIM. We present evidence that abLIM plays a crucial role in RGC axon pathfinding, sharing functional similarity with its C. elegans homolog, UNC-115. Our findings provide insights into a Brn-3.2-directed hierarchical program linking signaling events to cytoskeletal changes required for axon pathfinding."
https://openalex.org/W2042819884,"Fray is a serine/threonine kinase expressed by the peripheral glia of Drosophila, whose function is required for normal axonal ensheathment. Null fray mutants die early in larval development and have nerves with severe swelling and axonal defasciculation. The phenotype is associated with a failure of the ensheathing glia to correctly wrap peripheral axons. When the fray cDNA is expressed in the ensheathing glia of fray mutants, normal nerve morphology is restored. Fray belongs to a novel family of Ser/Thr kinases, the PF kinases, whose closest relatives are the PAK kinases. Rescue of the Drosophila mutant phenotype with PASK, the rat homolog of Fray, demonstrates a functional homology among these proteins and suggests that the Fray signaling pathway is widely conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2039103451,"Shc proteins possess SH2 and PTB domains and serve a scaffolding function in signaling by a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases. There are three known mammalian Shc genes, of which ShcB and ShcC are primarily expressed in the nervous system. We have generated null mutations in ShcB and ShcC and have obtained mice lacking either ShcB or ShcC or both gene products. ShcB-deficient animals exhibit a loss of peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptive sensory neurons, which is not enhanced by additional loss of ShcC. Mice lacking both ShcB and ShcC exhibit a significant loss of neurons within the superior cervical ganglia, which is not observed in either mutant alone. The results indicate that these Shc family members possess both unique and overlapping functions in regulating neural development and suggest physiological roles for ShcB/ShcC in TrkA signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2016084984,"Pheromonal activation of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) elicits genetically preprogrammed behaviors and physiological changes in mammals. We have identified a novel gene family encoding over one hundred VNO specific receptors, the V3Rs. V3R sequences are highly similar to each other and appear distantly related to the putative pheromone receptors, V1Rs, and the taste receptors, T2Rs. Within the VNO, V3R-positive neurons are distinct from neurons expressing the pheromone receptor families V1R and V2R. The V3Rs are likely to represent a new large family of pheromone receptors in mammals. Multiple V3R-related human sequences have been identified, including one clone retaining the capacity to create a complete and functional transcript. Our data uncover a striking complexity in the molecular and cellular organization of the VNO and provide an essential framework for the study of pheromone signaling in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1979057802,"We have shown that nitric oxide (NO) regulates c-fos gene expression via cGMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase), but NO's precise mechanism of action is unclear. We now demonstrate that: (1) NO targets two transcriptional elements in the fos promoter, i.e., the fos AP-1 binding site and the cAMP-response element (CRE); (2) NO activation of these two enhancer elements requires the CRE binding protein CREB because a dominant negative CREB fully inhibits NO transactivation of reporter genes whereas dominant negative Fos or CCAAT enhancer binding proteins have no effect; (3) CREB is phosphorylated by G-kinase in vitro and its phosphorylation increases in vivo when G-kinase is activated either directly by cGMP or indirectly by NO via soluble guanylate cyclase; (4) NO activation of fos promoter elements requires nuclear translocation of G-kinase but not activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2074989782,"The structure of the pore region of the alpha subunit of the bovine rod cyclic nucleotide-gated channel was probed using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and hydrophilic sulfhydryl-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents. A region homologous to the pore helix in the X-ray crystal structure of the KcsA K(+) channel showed a helical pattern of reactivity with externally applied MTS reagents. Surprisingly, three out of four of the reactive residues, all on one face of the pore helix, only reacted with MTS reagents in the closed state. A residue on the opposite face of the helix only reacted with MTS reagents in the open state. These results indicate that the pore helix (or its surroundings) undergoes a change in conformation, perhaps involving a rotation around its long axis, that opens a gate localized to the selectivity filter of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2043901673,"We have developed a variant of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) designed to be sensitive to static neuronal function. This method is based on resting instead of dynamic changes in oxygen-dependent signal and therefore allows for a spatial resolution that can detect signal from different hippocampal subregions in human subjects as well as in mice. We found that hippocampal signal was significantly diminished in elderly subjects with memory decline compared to age-matched controls, and different subjects showed dysfunction in different subregions. Among healthy elders, signal intensity from the subiculum was correlated selectively with memory performance. This method does not require an activation task; it can be used in anesthetized normal and in genetically modified and cognitively impaired mice. In mice the signal was found to be sufficiently sensitive to detect functional changes in the absence of underlying anatomical changes."
https://openalex.org/W1966987832,"Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) implement the process of axon guidance by promoting specific selection and attachment to substrates. We show that, in Drosophila, loss-of-function conditions of either the Neuroglian CAM, the FGF receptor coded by the gene heartless, or the EGF receptor coded by DER display a similar phenotype of abnormal substrate selection and axon guidance by peripheral sensory neurons. Moreover, neuroglian loss-of-function phenotype can be suppressed by the expression of gain-of-function conditions of heartless or DER. The results are consistent with a scenario where the activity of these receptor tyrosine kinases is controlled by Neuroglian at choice points where sensory axons select between alternative substrates for extension."

https://openalex.org/W2318318177,"In a previous study, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 28 chromosome 9 microsatellite markers was assessed on 139 Ta/T1 bladder tumors. LOH at one or more loci was detected in 67 tumors, 62 presenting subchromosomal deletions. One hundred and thirty-three of these patients have now been followed for up to 8 years. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential biological significance of chromosome 9 deletions in superficial bladder tumors at initial diagnosis. High grade was associated with LOH (P=0.004). Large tumors carried more frequently 9p deletions (P=0.022). Female patients had more chromosome 9q LOH than male patients did (P=0.010). Chromosome 9 LOH at all loci was associated with an elevated risk of recurrence but four regions were associated with a particularly high risk of recurrence. Multivariate analysis taking into account grade, stage, size and number of tumors showed that tumors deleted in the regions 9ptr-p22, 9q22.3, 9q33, and 9q34 recurred significantly more rapidly than those without deletions (Recurrence rate ratio=2.32, 2.53, 2.52 and 2.43 respectively). Log-rank statistics comparing Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the same chromosomal regions confirmed the correlation (P=0.0002, 0.010, 0.002 and 0.009 respectively). Only four patients progressed to muscle-invasive disease. They all had extensive deletions on 9q but none had deletions at 9ptr-p22. This study suggests a link between chromosome 9 anomalies and recurrence of superficial bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2078790300,"PKC is activated on the cell membrane by phospholipids, thereby transducing signals to intracellular pathways. We provide here another function of PKC, namely, regulating cell cycle by interaction with the cyclin E/cdk2/p21 complex. Among the 10 isoforms of PKC, PKCη is predominantly expressed in squamous cell epithelia and induces terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. PKCη that is endogenously expressed or overexpressed was found to associate with the cyclin E/cdk2/p21 complex in keratinocytes of mice and humans. Requirement of a possible adaptor protein to the binding was suggested by the reconstitution of PKCη and the cyclin E/cdk2/p21 complex which were prepared from human keratinocytes or Sf9 insect cells. Colocalization of PKCη with cdk2 and cyclin E was observed in the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear region. p21 was phosphorylated in the complex in a PKC-activator dependent manner. Association of PKCη with cdk2 resulted in marked inhibition of cdk2-kinase activity when measured by phosphorylation of Rb. Dominant negative PKCη associated with the cyclin E/cdk2/p21 complex, but caused a little inhibition of cdk2 kinase activity. Among the known regulatory mechanisms of cdk2 activity, dephosphorylation of Thr160 was demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2003595804,"Mechanisms by which chemotherapeutic agents induce apoptosis are not completely understood. Current knowledge of the actual pharmacologic effects of chemotherapy and their biochemical mechanisms are better understood than the downstream events, which initiate the apoptotic cascade. The chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin causes DNA damage and can induce apoptosis in several types of human cancers. We found the formation of previously unreported nuclear complexes between the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, in human melanoma cell lines induced into apoptosis following cisplatin exposure. These detergent resistant complexes were detected: after wild type (wt) p53 and Bax increased in the nucleus; at the same time when active cytoplasmic apoptosis related protease, caspase 3/CPP32 appeared; and prior to the detection of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Three channel fluorescence laser scanning confocal image microscopy revealed that the nuclear Bax/p53 complexes remained in the nucleus and localized proximal to DNA fragmentation sites as assayed by TUNEL after cisplatin exposure. Two human melanoma cell lines, expressing wt p53, were induced into apoptosis after cisplatin exposure, however they differed in the timing of this induction. In both cell lines the formation of nuclear Bax/p53 co-immunoprecipitable complexes correlated with the timing of the induction of apoptosis. The degree of apoptosis induced by different concentrations of cisplatin correlated with the amount of nuclear Bax/p53 complexes. The co-immunoprecipitation of Bax and p53 was found regardless of the antibodies tested and was specific since Bcl-xL/p53 complexes were not detected. Additionally, the human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, also formed nuclear Bax/p53 complexes only after apoptosis was induced by paclitaxel."

https://openalex.org/W1981780095,"Primates with long-standing therapeutic amputations of a limb at a young age were used to investigate the possibility that deefferented motor nerves sprout to new muscle targets. Injections of anatomical tracers into the muscles proximal to the amputated stump labeled a larger extent of motoneurons than matched injections on the intact side or in normal animals, including motoneurons that would normally supply only the missing limb muscles. Although the total numbers of distal limb motoneurons remained normal, some distal limb motoneurons on the amputated side were smaller in size and simpler in form. These results suggest that deprived motoneurons survive and retain function by reinnervating new muscle targets. The sprouted motor efferents may account for some of the reorganization of primary motor cortex that follows long-standing amputation."

https://openalex.org/W1999314540,"ErbB2 can be activated by its own overexpression or be transactivated by the heregulin polypeptide growth factor. Activation of ErbB2 leads to breast cancer cell proliferation, presumably by inducing the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1,2 (Erk1,2) and Akt. We have previously reported that the growth factor receptor bound protein-2 (Grb2) is required for the proliferation of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. We investigated here whether Grb2 protein plays a role in heregulin-stimulated proliferation. Grb2 protein inhibition led to growth inhibition of heregulin-stimulated breast cancer cells, but not Erk1,2 inactivation. These findings are similar to our earlier observations in ErbB2-overexpressing cells. Since Akt can also be activated by heregulin, the effects of Grb2 inhibition on Akt were examined. Akt was inactivated following Grb2 downregulation in heregulin-stimulated breast cancer cells. We then examined the effects of Grb2 downregulation on Akt in ErbB2-overexpressing cells in the absence of heregulin. Similar to heregulin-stimulated cells, Grb2 inhibition also led to Akt inactivation in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Our results indicate that the activation of ErbB2 by heregulin or by its overexpression requires Grb2 to stimulate the Akt pathway to propagate mitogenic signals."
https://openalex.org/W2020084538,"GP125/CD98 is a heterodimeric 125-kDa glycoprotein, which consists of an 85-kDa heavy chain (hc) and a 40-kDa light chain (lc), and is strongly expressed on the cell surface of various tumor cells, irrespective of their tissue of origin. We have recently demonstrated that overexpression of the CD98hc cDNA causes malignant transformation of NIH3T3 cells. To investigate the function of the extracellular domain of CD98hc in cell proliferation and malignant transformation, we established two NIH3T3-derived clones transfected with human truncated CD98hc cDNAs, and compared their characteristics with parental NIH3T3 and clones transfected with full-length CD98hc cDNA. Truncated as well as full-length CD98hc-transfected clones grew to a higher saturation density than control cells. Efficiency of colony formation in soft agar was augmented in all CD98hc-transfected clones, and the degrees of augmented colony formation of the transfectants expressing full-length CD98hc of 529 a.a. or truncated CD98hc of 418 a.a. were reduced by anti-human CD98hc antibodies, while that of the transfectant expressing truncated CD98hc of 237 a.a. lacking the epitopes recognized by anti-human CD98hc antibodies was not affected by the addition of antibodies. CD98hc-transfected clones developed tumors in athymic mice, and tumor growth of truncated CD98hc-transfected clones was faster than that of full-length CD98hc-transfected clones."
https://openalex.org/W2328205394,"Polyomavirus large T-antigen (PyLT-Ag), a nucleophosphoprotein essential for regulating viral gene expression, modulates the cell cycle by binding to the Rb tumor suppressor gene product. PyLT-Ag/Rb binding is essential for in vitro immortalization. However, the effect of PyLT-Ag on apoptosis has not been extensively studied. We have previously reported that FasR agonist antibodies (FasR(Ab)) treatment of Sertoli cells derived from transgenic mice expressing PyLT-Ag induces the growth arrest of these cells without concomitant apoptosis. Here we show that stable expression of PyLT-Ag in murine Sertoli TM4 and hybridoma NSO cell lines confers protection from FasR(Ab)-induced apoptosis. The protection was maintained up to 48 h when cells were grown continuously in the presence of FasR(Ab). Removal of the death stimulus after 24 h exposure was sufficient to allow full recovery of the PyLT-Ag expressing cells. The protective effect conferred by PyLT-Ag was associated with a delay in the sequential activation of caspase-8 and -3 after FasR(Ab) treatment. PyLT-Ag co-precipitated following immunoprecipitation of caspase-8 or FADD, both components of the DISC. Based on these results we suggest that PyLT-Ag directly impedes the recruitment or activation of caspase-8 by the FasR. PyLT-Ag expression in TM4 cells was also associated with protection from TNF-alpha- and taxol-induced apoptosis. In contrast, PyLT-Ag expression was not sufficient to confer protection from captothecin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that PyLT-Ag can be a potent inhibitor of Fas(R)(Ab)-, TNF-alpha- and taxol-induced apoptosis."
