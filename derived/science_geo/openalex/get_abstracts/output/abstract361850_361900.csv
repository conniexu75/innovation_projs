https://openalex.org/W2029609684,"Neuronal oscillations in various frequency bands have been reported in numerous studies in both humans and animals. While it is obvious that these oscillations play an important role in cognitive processing, it remains unclear how oscillations in various frequency bands interact. In this study we have investigated phase to power locking in MEG activity of healthy human subjects at rest with their eyes closed. To examine cross-frequency coupling, we have computed coherence between the time course of the power in a given frequency band and the signal itself within every channel. The time-course of the power was calculated using a sliding tapered time window followed by a Fourier transform. Our findings show that high-frequency gamma power (30–70 Hz) is phase-locked to alpha oscillations (8–13 Hz) in the ongoing MEG signals. The topography of the coupling was similar to the topography of the alpha power and was strongest over occipital areas. Interestingly, gamma activity per se was not evident in the power spectra and only became detectable when studied in relation to the alpha phase. Intracranial data from an epileptic subject confirmed these findings albeit there was slowing in both the alpha and gamma band. A tentative explanation for this phenomenon is that the visual system is inhibited during most of the alpha cycle whereas a burst of gamma activity at a specific alpha phase (e.g. at troughs) reflects a window of excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2044711113,"The key enzyme responsible for beta-carotene conversion into retinal is beta-carotene 15,15'-monoxygenase (BCMO1). Since it has been reported that the conversion of beta-carotene into vitamin A is highly variable in up to 45% of healthy individuals, we hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in the BCMO1 gene could contribute to the occurrence of the poor converter phenotype. Here we describe the screening of the total open reading frame of the BCMO1 coding region that led to the identification of two common nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (R267S: rs12934922; A379V: rs7501331) with variant allele frequencies of 42 and 24%, respectively. In vitro biochemical characterization of the recombinant 267S + 379V double mutant revealed a reduced catalytic activity of BCMO1 by 57% (P<0.001). Assessment of the responsiveness to a pharmacological dose of beta-carotene in female volunteers confirmed that carriers of both the 379V and 267S + 379V variant alleles had a reduced ability to convert beta-carotene, as indicated through reduced retinyl palmitate:beta-carotene ratios in the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein fraction [-32% (P=0.005) and -69% (P=0.001), respectively] and increased fasting beta-carotene concentrations [+160% (P=0.025) and +240% (P=0.041), respectively]. Our data show that there is genetic variability in beta-carotene metabolism and may provide an explanation for the molecular basis of the poor converter phenotype within the population."
https://openalex.org/W1970261233,"Metabolic and stress response gene regulation is crucial for the survival of an organism to a changing environment. Three key molecules that sense nutrients and broadly affect gene expression are the FoxO transcription factors, the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1alpha, and the dynamic post-translational modification, O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). Here we identify novel post-translational modifications of PGC-1alpha, including O-GlcNAc, and describe a novel mechanism for how PGC-1alpha co-activates transcription by FoxOs. In liver, in cultured cells, and in vitro with recombinant proteins, PGC-1alpha binds to O-GlcNAc transferase and targets the enzyme to FoxOs, resulting in their increased GlcNAcylation and increased transcriptional activity. Furthermore, glucose-enhanced activation of FoxO1 occurs via this PGC-1alpha-O-GlcNAc transferase-mediated GlcNAcylation. Therefore, one mechanism by which PGC-1alpha can serve as a co-activator of transcription is by targeting the O-GlcNAc transferase to increase GlcNAcylation of specific transcription factors important to nutrient/stress sensing and energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1990323783,"A light signal is converted into an electrical one in a single molecule named channelrhodopsin, one of the archaea-type rhodopsins in unicellular green algae. Although highly homologous, two molecules of this family, channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1) and -2 (ChR2), are distinct in photocurrent properties such as the wavelength sensitivity, desensitization, and turning-on and -off kinetics. However, the structures regulating these properties have not been completely identified. Photocurrents were analyzed for several chimera molecules made by replacing N-terminal segments of ChR2 with the homologous counterparts of ChR1. We found that the wavelength sensitivity of the photocurrent was red-shifted with negligible desensitization and slowed turning-on and -off kinetics when replacement was made with the segment containing the fifth transmembrane helix of ChR1. Therefore, this segment is involved in the determination of photocurrent properties, the wavelength sensitivity, and the kinetics characterizing ChR1 and ChR2. Eight amino acid residues differentiating this segment were exchanged one-by-one, and the photocurrent properties of each targeted mutant ChR2 were further analyzed. Among them, position Tyr226(ChR1)/Asn187(ChR2) is one of the molecular determinants involved in the wavelength sensitivity, desensitization, and turning-on and -off kinetics. It is suggested that these amino acid residues directly or indirectly interact with the chromophore as well as with the protein structure determining the photocurrent kinetics. Some of the chimera channelrhodopsins are suggested to have several advantages over the wild-type ChR2 in the introduction of light-induced membrane depolarization for the purpose of artificial stimulation of neurons in vivo and visual prosthesis for photoreceptor degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2010238834,"The pineal gland plays an essential role in vertebrate chronobiology by converting time into a hormonal signal, melatonin, which is always elevated at night. Here we have analyzed the rodent pineal transcriptome using Affymetrix GeneChip® technology to obtain a more complete description of pineal cell biology. The effort revealed that 604 genes (1,268 probe sets) with Entrez Gene identifiers are differentially expressed greater than 2-fold between midnight and mid-day (false discovery rate <0.20). Expression is greater at night in ∼70%. These findings were supported by the results of radiochemical in situ hybridization histology and quantitative real time-PCR studies. We also found that the regulatory mechanism controlling the night/day changes in the expression of most genes involves norepinephrine-cyclic AMP signaling. Comparison of the pineal gene expression profile with that in other tissues identified 334 genes (496 probe sets) that are expressed greater than 8-fold higher in the pineal gland relative to other tissues. Of these genes, 17% are expressed at similar levels in the retina, consistent with a common evolutionary origin of these tissues. Functional categorization of the highly expressed and/or night/day differentially expressed genes identified clusters that are markers of specialized functions, including the immune/inflammation response, melatonin synthesis, photodetection, thyroid hormone signaling, and diverse aspects of cellular signaling and cell biology. These studies produce a paradigm shift in our understanding of the 24-h dynamics of the pineal gland from one focused on melatonin synthesis to one including many cellular processes.

These studies produce a paradigm shift in our understanding of the 24-h dynamics of the pineal gland from one focused on melatonin synthesis to one including many cellular processes. A defining feature of the pineal gland is a 24-h rhythm in melatonin synthesis. Melatonin provides vertebrates with a circulating signal of time and is essential for optimal integration of physiological functions with environmental lighting on a daily and seasonal basis (1Maronde E.

The melatonin rhythm in mammals is driven by a circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), 13The abbreviations used are: SCN, suprachiasmatic nucleus; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; pCREB, phosphor-CREB; CRE, cAMP response element; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; FDR, false discovery rate; qRT-PCR, quantitative real time-PCR; PWM, position weight matrices; SCG, superior cervical ganglia; NE, norepinephrine; ZT, Zeitgeber time; LD, light-dark; T3, thyroid hormone. which is hard-wired to the pineal gland by a polysynaptic pathway that courses through central and peripheral neuronal structures. The pineal gland is innervated by projections from the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) in the form of a dense network of catecholamine-containing sympathetic fibers. Activation of the SCN → pineal pathway occurs at night and results in the release of norepinephrine (NE) from the sympathetic fibers into the pineal perivascular space (5Moller M. Baeres F.M. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 309: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). NE activates the pinealocyte through adrenergic receptors (5Moller M. Baeres F.M.

The best studied mechanism involves coincident “AND” gate activation of α1b- and β1-adrenergic receptors, which maximally stimulates adenylate cyclase, thereby elevating cAMP (7Sugden L.A. Sugden D.

Pineal Res. 1988; 5: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). cAMP is believed to mediate the effects of NE on melatonin production to a large part by activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In rodents, this induces expression of Aanat, the penultimate enzyme in melatonin synthesis (17Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4233-4237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Induction occurs through phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) bound to cAMP-response elements (CREs) in the Aanat gene. A similar NE/cAMP mechanism also controls expression of Adra1b, Atp7b, Crem, 14One transcript isoform of Crem, termed Icer, is known to be highly rhythmic in the rat pineal gland. Therefore, throughout the text, when Crem is mentioned in the context of the pineal gland, the term refers to the Icer isoform.

De Jesus M. Liu T. Wang M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16315-16319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although it is likely that some of the effects of cAMP involve CREs, it is also likely that cAMP influences pineal gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms that alter chromatin structure, e.g. histone phosphorylation (29Chik C.L. Arnason T.G. Dukewich W.G. Price D.M. Ranger A. Ho A.K. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Ho A.K. Price D.M. Dukewich W.G. Steinberg N. Arnason T.G. Chik C.L. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 4592-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), thereby having the potential of altering the expression of many genes and broadly promoting transcription by factors other than CREB. Whereas there is abundant evidence that the SCN/SCG/NE/cAMP system controls rhythmic gene expression in the pineal gland, it is also possible that other regulatory mechanisms exist, involving release of other transmitters, and additional second messengers (e.g. cGMP, Ca2+, and phospholipids). The increased abundance of some of these night/day differentially expressed genes and of other genes in the pineal gland is determined in part by members of the OTX2/CRX family of homeodomain proteins, which play a similar role in the retina (31Furukawa A. Koike C. Lippincott P. Cepko C.L. Furukawa T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1640-1647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Furukawa T. Morrow E.M. Li T. Davis F.C. Cepko C.L. Nat.

These factors bind to photoreceptor conserved elements and closely related sequences. In addition, Pax6 and Otx2 are essential for development of both tissues (35Estivill-Torrus G. Vitalis T. Fernandez-Llebrez P. Price D.J. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 36Gehring W.J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar, 37Nishida A.

This developmental similarity is consistent with the common evolutionary origin of the pineal gland and retina from a primitive photodetector (38Klein D.C. Chronobiol. Int. 2006; 23: 5-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Examples of OTX2/CRX-controlled genes expressed in both tissues include Aanat, Asmt, Sag, and Grk1 (20Li X. Chen S. Wang Q. Zack D.J.

The first two encode proteins dedicated to melatonin synthesis; the latter two encode proteins associated with phototransduction in the retina. It is not clear whether the proteins encoded by these phototransduction genes play parallel roles in NE/cAMP signal transduction in the pinealocyte or if they are functionally vestigial in the context of the pinealocyte. Although OTX2 and CRX are of central importance in these tissues, it appears that other transcription factors and regulatory cascades are involved. For example, the importance of E-boxes in determining tissue-specific expression of Aanat is evident from several studies (42Appelbaum L. Toyama R. Dawid I.B. Klein D.C. Baler R. Gothilf Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1210-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 47Gothilf Y. Coon S.L. Toyama R. Chitnis A. Namboodiri M.A. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4895-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and NeuroD1 may also play a role in determining pineal gland-specific expression patterns (48Munoz E.M. Bailey M.J. Rath M.F. Shi Q. Morin F. Coon S.L. Moller M. Klein D.C. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Whereas in both the pineal gland and retina, photoreceptor conserved elements control developmental expression of the same gene, different mechanisms can operate in each tissue to control rhythmicity. For example, in the case of Aanat, CREs mediate cAMP control of 24-h rhythms in the pineal gland (49Roseboom P.H. Klein D.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 439-449PubMed Google Scholar, 50Baler R. Covington S. Klein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6979-6985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the retina, however, E-box elements mediate circadian clock control of the 24-h rhythm in Aanat expression (51Tosini G. Chaurasia S.S. Michael Iuvone P. Chronobiol. Int. 2006; 23: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition to the accepted SCN/SCG/NE/cAMP pathway, reports in the literature have claimed that a circadian clock regulates daily changes in the expression of some genes in the mammalian pineal gland (52Fukuhara C. Liu C. Ivanova T.N. Chan G.C. Storm D.R. Iuvone P.M. Tosini G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1803-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), as in the submammalian pineal gland (53Iuvone P.M. Bernard M. Alonso-Gomez A. Greve P. Cassone V.M. Klein D.C. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 54Falcon J. Gothilf Y. Coon S.L. Boeuf G. Klein D.C. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2003; 15: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The physiological impact of this remains unknown. Here we have expanded our understanding of the transcriptional regulation and physiology of the pineal gland by employing Affymetrix GeneChip® technology, including a microarray that interrogates more than 13,663 genes that have been assigned Entrez Gene identifiers. 15Where numbers of genes in various categories are given, this refers to probe sets that have been annotated with Entrez Gene identifiers by Affymetrix as of November 5, 2007, and updated manually as of June 15, 2008. The gene symbols that are used have been taken from Entrez Gene; associated Gene titles and Entrez Gene identifiers are given in supplemental Tables S3, S4, and S5. Gene symbols beginning with LOC, RGD, or MGC are not included in the tables in the text; they are included in the supplemental tables. Previous studies of this nature in the rat have identified 39 night/day differentially expressed genes (26Humphries A. Klein D. Baler R. Carter D.A. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2002; 14: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); a more recent study identified 35 such genes with Entrez Gene identifiers (59 probe sets) (55Fukuhara C. Tosini G. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 60: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our study had three specific goals. The first goal was to produce a comprehensive listing of genes that are differentially expressed on a night/day basis. The second goal was to identify the highly enriched genes that define pineal function, independent of whether they are tonically or night/day differentially expressed; this was done by comparing gene expression in the pineal gland to median expression among other tissues. The third goal was to determine the scope of the NE/cAMP regulatory cascade; this approach utilized an in vitro organ culture system. In addition to establishing the importance of this cascade, the organ culture studies identified sets of genes that were spontaneously up- or down-regulated more than 10-fold during culture in defined medium, providing evidence of the existence of unknown regulatory mechanisms. An unexpected discovery was that the pineal transcriptome includes a large number of immune/inflammation response-associated genes. The findings of this study are of value to investigators interested in the pineal gland, chronobiology, neuroendocrinology, and immunology and to those who study specific genes that are night/day differentially and/or highly expressed in the pineal gland. Three microarray experiments were done (experiments A, B, and C). For microarray experiments A and B (Cardiff University), Sprague-Dawley rats (2–3 months old) were maintained in standard laboratory conditions in a 14:10 light-dark (LD) cycle (lights on, 05:00 h). Animals were killed at mid-day (ZT7) or midnight (ZT19) by cervical dislocation, and pineal glands were rapidly dissected, placed in tubes on solid CO2, and stored at –80 °C. For microarray experiment C (NICHD, National Institutes of Health), for the time series analysis of gene expression by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4), and for organ culture experiments, Sprague-Dawley rats (2–3 months old, female) were housed for 2 weeks in LD 14:10 lighting cycles, killed by CO2 asphyxiation, and decapitated; pineal glands were rapidly dissected and either placed in tubes on solid CO2 and stored at –80 °C or were prepared for organ culture. Other tissues were also removed, and 10-mg samples were frozen and stored in a similar manner. For the qRT-PCR experiment (Fig. 4), tissues were collected at ZT1, -7, -13.5, -15, -16, -17.5, -19, and -22, placed in tubes on solid CO2, and stored at –80 °C. Glands for organ culture experiments were obtained at ZT4–6 and placed in culture within 60 min. For radiochemical in situ hybridization histology studies (University of Copenhagen), Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats (Charles River, Germany) were housed for 2 weeks in a controlled lighting environment (LD 12:12). Animals were killed by decapitation at ZT6 and ZT18; their brains were removed, immediately placed in solid CO2, and stored at –80 °C until sectioned. Animal use and care protocols were approved by local ethical review, and they were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines, United Kingdom Home Office Regulations, and Health Sciences Animal Policy European Union Directive 86/609/EEC (approved by the Danish Council for Animal Experiments). For organ culture, rat pineal glands were cultured in BGJb medium as described previously (56Parfitt A. Weller J.L. Klein D.C. Neuropharmacology. 1976; 15: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and detailed in the supplemental material. Glands were incubated (1 gland/well) with fresh media containing NE (1 μm), dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP; 0.5 or 1 mm), or forskolin (10 μm) (Sigma). Following a 6-h treatment, glands were placed in microtubes on solid CO2. To confirm that the glands were activated by the drugs, melatonin production in the culture media was measured by tandem mass spectroscopy as described (57Yu A.M. Idle J.R. Byrd L.G. Krausz K.W. Kupfer A. Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacogenetics. 2003; 13: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), with an internal d4-melatonin standard. The amount of melatonin produced (nanomoles/gland/6 h; means ± S.E.) for the control, NE-treated, Bt2cAMP-treated, and forskolin-treated groups was (number of samples) 1.4 ± 0.1 (9Chik C.L. Ho A.K.

Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 702-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); 9.9 ± 0.9 (9Chik C.L. Ho A.K. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 702-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 15.0 ± 1.2 (9Chik C.L. Ho A.K. Klein D.C. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 702-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. For the analysis of pineal glands in experiments A and B, two sets of six pooled samples of four rat pineal glands each were prepared (three night and three day). In experiment C, four pools, each containing three glands, were prepared for each time point; as part of this experiment, single retinas and 10-mg samples of the cerebellum, neocortex, hypothalamus, liver, and heart were also obtained. Glands were also obtained from organ culture experiments in which each treatment group was comprised of three pools, each containing four glands. Total RNA was isolated, labeled and used to interrogate Affymetrix GeneChips® as detailed in the supplemental material. The microarray data presented here are derived from the experiments described below (A, B, and C) in conjunction with a published tissue profiling effort (Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF), Entrez Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), dataset GDS589 (58Walker J.R. Su A.I. Self D.W. Hogenesch J.B. Lapp H. Maier R. Hoyer D. Bilbe G. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). Microarray experiment A (Cardiff University) used the Affymetrix RG_U34A microarray (8,799 probe sets, 4,996 genes). Results from microarray experiment A were compared with data from the GNF data base, which had been generated using the same microarray. Expression data for the following 23 Sprague-Dawley tissues and isolated cells were used (number of samples per tissue is in parentheses): neocortex (39), cerebellum (17), striatum (13), hippocampus (3), hypothalamus (2), pituitary (2), amygdala (10), nucleus accumbens (6), locus ceruleus (2), dorsal raphe (2), ventral tegmental area (2), pineal gland (2), dorsal root ganglion (2), cornea (2), heart (2), intestine (4), kidney (2), spleen (2), thymus (2), bone marrow (2), muscle (2), Sertoli cells (10), and endothelial cells (2). Microarray experiment B (Cardiff University) used the RAE230A microarray (15,923 probe sets, 10,174 genes). Microarray experiment C (NICHD, National Institutes of Health) used the Rat230_2 microarray (31,099 probe sets, 13,663 genes); this experiment included pineal glands and other tissues (retina, neocortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus, heart, and liver) obtained at mid-day and midnight, and glands obtained from organ culture. Night/Day Differences in Gene Expression-Affymetrix MAS5 Signal and Present Call values were stored in the NIH-LIMS, a data base for storage and retrieval of microarray data. The microarray data are available at the Entrez Gene Expression Omnibus, National Center for Biotechnology Information (59Edgar R. Domrachev M. Lash A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 207-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE12344 (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and at sne.nichd.nih.gov. Data were statistically analyzed using the MSCL Analyst Toolbox (P. J. Munson, J. J. Barb, abs.cit.nih.gov) and the JMP statistical software package (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC). Affymetrix signal values were incremented by a value of 0.1× microarray median value, then normalized to 1.1× microarray median values, and finally decimal log-transformed. This transformation is termed “Lmed” and has the desirable effect of reducing the influence of very small expression values. One-way, two-level analysis of variance testing differences between night and day were performed on the transformed data, and significance (p values, or false discovery rate (FDR) (60Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar)) was reported (see supplemental Table S3). Night-day log fold changes were computed as the difference between the night and day Lmed values; in experiment C, NE/control and Bt2cAMP/control log fold change values were calculated similarly. Expression ratios are reported as linear values; values less than one are reported using the 1/X convention in which X = the night/day ratio, i.e. a night/day ratio of 0.01 is displayed as 1/100. Table 1 details the expression ratios (night/day, NE/control, Bt2cAMP/control) of all genes with a Entrez Gene identifier and with a night/day ratio greater than 4 or less than ¼. The supplemental Table S3 presents the expression ratios of all probe sets with a night/day ratio greater than 2 or less than ½.TABLE 1Differential expression of genes in the pineal gland* Predicted gene is indicated. Open table in a new tab * Predicted gene is indicated. Expression of Genes in the Pineal Gland Relative to Other Tissues-Gene expression in one tissue relative to expression in other tissues was defined as the relative tissue expression (rEx) value, which was calculated as the ratio of maximum expression (the highest of day or night) to the median expression of that gene in other tissues. In experiment A, median values were calculated from 23 Sprague-Dawley tissues in the GNF data base (see above) plus the day and night pineal gland values generated in experiment A. In experiment C, the median values were calculated from the average expression levels in each of seven tissues (see above). These averages were based on single mid-day and midnight values, except in the case of the pineal gland for which four mid-day and four midnight values were used. The larger of two rEx values obtained using the two experiments is presented in Table 3, which contains genes with rEx values greater than 8. The supplemental Table S4 includes rEx values from both experiments for probe sets with rEx values greater than 2.TABLE 3Genes highly expressed in the pineal gland relative to other tissuesPineal rExGene symbol>16A2m, Aanat, Abca1, Abhd14b, Adra1b, Adrb1, Aipl1, Alox15, Arhgap24, Arr3, Asl, Asmt, Atp7b, Ca3, Cabp1, Cacna1f, Camk1g, Ccl9, Cd1d1, Cd24, Cdh22, Chga, Chrna3, Chrnb4, Cnga1, Cngb1, Cntrob,aPredicted gene is indicated.

https://openalex.org/W1968199051,"Hox genes define regional identities along the anterior-posterior axis in many animals. In a number of species, Hox genes are clustered in the genome, and the relative order of genes corresponds with position of expression in the body. Previous Hox gene studies in lophotrochozoans have reported expression for only a subset of the Hox gene complement and/or lack detailed genomic organization information, limiting interpretations of spatial and temporal colinearity in this diverse animal clade. We studied expression and genomic organization of the single Hox gene complement in the segmented polychaete annelid Capitella sp. I. Total genome searches identified 11 Hox genes in Capitella, representing 11 distinct paralog groups thought to represent the ancestral lophotrochozoan complement. At least 8 of the 11 Capitella Hox genes are genomically linked in a single cluster, have the same transcriptional orientation, and lack interspersed non-Hox genes. Studying their expression by situ hybridization, we find that the 11 Capitella Hox genes generally exhibit spatial and temporal colinearity. With the exception of CapI-Post1, Capitella Hox genes are all expressed in broad ectodermal domains during larval development, consistent with providing positional information along the anterior-posterior axis. The anterior genes CapI-lab, CapI-pb, and CapI-Hox3 initiate expression prior to the appearance of segments, while more posterior genes appear at or soon after segments appear. Many of the Capitella Hox genes have either an anterior or posterior expression boundary coinciding with the thoracic-abdomen transition, a major body tagma boundary. Following metamorphosis, several expression patterns change, including appearance of distinct posterior boundaries and restriction to the central nervous system. Capitella Hox genes have maintained a clustered organization, are expressed in the canonical anterior-posterior order found in other metazoans, and exhibit spatial and temporal colinearity, reflecting Hox gene characteristics that likely existed in the protostome-deuterostome ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W2167758548,"The Kv1.3 potassium channel plays an essential role in effector memory T cells and has been implicated in several important autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and type 1 diabetes. A number of potent small molecule inhibitors of Kv1.3 channel have been reported, some of which were found to be effective in various animal models of autoimmune diseases. We report herein the identification of clofazimine, a known anti-mycobacterial drug, as a novel inhibitor of human Kv1.3. Clofazimine was initially identified as an inhibitor of intracellular T cell receptor-mediated signaling leading to the transcriptional activation of human interleukin-2 gene in T cells from a screen of the Johns Hopkins Drug Library. A systematic mechanistic deconvolution revealed that clofazimine selectively blocked the Kv1.3 channel activity, perturbing the oscillation frequency of the calcium-release activated calcium channel, which in turn led to the inhibition of the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway. These effects of clofazimine provide the first line of experimental evidence in support of a causal relationship between Kv1.3 and calcium oscillation in human T cells. Furthermore, clofazimine was found to be effective in blocking human T cell-mediated skin graft rejection in an animal model in vivo. Together, these results suggest that clofazimine is a promising immunomodulatory drug candidate for treating a variety of autoimmune disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2055591486,"Chronic hyperglycemia contributes to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction during the development of type 2 diabetes. Treatment of pancreatic β-cells with prolonged high glucose concentrations has been shown to reduce insulin promoter activity and insulin gene expression. Here, we examined the effect of high glucose on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway activation and insulin production in INS-1 832/13 pancreatic β-cells. Treatment of cells with 25 mm glucose for 24-48 h decreased insulin mRNA and protein levels and reduced the proinsulin translation rate, which was accompanied by enhanced unfolded protein response pathway activation (XBP-1 mRNA splicing and increased phospho-eIF2α, CHOP, and active ATF6 levels). Overexpressing the ER chaperone GRP78 partially rescued high glucose-induced suppression of proinsulin levels and improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with no effect on insulin 2 mRNA levels. Under these conditions, there was little effect of GRP78 overexpression on ER stress markers. Knockdown of GRP78 expression under basal glucose conditions reduced cellular insulin levels and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Thus, GRP78 is essential for insulin biosynthesis, and enhancing chaperone capacity can improve β-cell function in the presence of prolonged hyperglycemia. In contrast, overexpression of the ER chaperone and oxidoreductase protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and induced ER stress resulting from the accumulation of proinsulin in the ER. These results suggest a role for both GRP78 and PDI in insulin biosynthesis, although an excess of PDI disrupts normal proinsulin processing.

These results suggest a role for both GRP78 and PDI in insulin biosynthesis, although an excess of PDI disrupts normal proinsulin processing. Type 2 diabetes is associated with various abnormalities, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction (1Muoio D.M. Newgard C.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 9: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The disease is characterized by abnormally elevated blood glucose levels. Prolonged or chronic hyperglycemia has been implicated in causing or contributing to detrimental effects in various tissues, such as the kidney, eye, peripheral nerves, and pancreatic β-cells, that lead to diabetic complications and exacerbation of the disease. In pancreatic β-cells, an acute increase in blood glucose normally stimulates insulin secretion, increases proinsulin translation, and enhances insulin gene transcription (2Ren, J., Jin, P., Wang, E., Liu, E., Harlan, D. M., Li, X., and Stroncek, D. F. (2007) J. Transl. Med. http://www.translational-medicine.com/context/5/1/1Google Scholar). However, prolonged hyperglycemia has been shown to cause various detrimental effects on insulin secretion and insulin biosynthesis (3Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 4Poitout V. Hagman D. Stein R. Artner I. Robertson R.P. Harmon J.S. J.

Chronic high glucose reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and the function of several key transcription factors, such as Pdx-1 and MafA, resulting in reduced insulin gene transcription. In addition, prolonged hyperglycemia may have effects on proinsulin translational control, although this still requires further study (6Shalev A. Blair P.J. Hoffman S.C. Hirshberg B.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3905-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). ER stress occurs when the protein folding capacity of the ER is not sufficient to deal with protein folding demands or when an excess of misfolded or aggregated proteins accumulate. Such conditions activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) that transiently reduces the amount of new protein synthesis and increases folding capacity and degradation of terminally misfolded proteins (14Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar). ER stress is physiologically encountered by the pancreatic β-cell, which must regulate its chaperone capacity to meet normal insulin biosynthetic demands. Insulin translation is regulated in the β-cell via eIF2α phosphorylation by the PERK pathway (15Scheuner D. Vander Mierde D. Song B. Flamez D. Creemers J.W.M. Tsukamoto K. Ribick M. Schuit F.C. Kaufman R.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and this pathway is critical to β-cell function. Knock-out of PERK leads to severe β-cell dysfunction and death in rodents (16Harding H.P. Zeng H. Zhang Y. Jungries R. Chung P. Plesken H. Sabatini D.D. Ron D. Mol.

Barrett T. Golamaully M. Lathrop G.M. Julier C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The consequences of prolonged ER stress potentially due to chronic hyperglycemia or the contribution that ER stress has in causing abnormal effects on β-cell function (insulin biosynthesis) or survival are not fully established. In this study, we examined the effect of prolonged high glucose on ER stress pathway activation and insulin production and secretion in INS-1 832/13 pancreatic β-cells. Treatment of INS-1 832/13 cells with prolonged high glucose decreased insulin mRNA and protein levels. Although some markers of UPR signaling were elevated, it appears that hyperglycemia per se does not elicit a characteristic ER stress response as chaperone expression was not induced by high glucose. However, we found that GRP78 and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), two ER chaperone proteins, are required for normal insulin synthesis. Overexpressing GRP78 partially rescued prolonged high glucose-induced suppression of steady-state proinsulin levels and suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Recombinant Adenovirus Production—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing full-length human GRP78 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) were prepared as described (19Lai E. Bikopoulos G. Wheeler M.B. Rozakis-Adcock M. Volchuk A. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 294: E540-E550Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Full-length human PDI cDNA was amplified by PCR from pCMV6-SPORT, a plasmid obtained from Dr. Lloyd Ruddock (University of Oulu, Finland), and cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The resulting TOPO-PDI was cut with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences). Cloning of the full-length PDI into pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP-2 vector (Stratagene) was performed using the BglII/SalI sites. For production of PDI mutant construct (PDIm), the cysteine residues in the catalytic thioredoxin-like domains of PDI (Cys-53, Cys-56, Cys-397, and Cys-400) were mutated to serine using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To produce an adenovirus expressing GRP78, PDI, or enhanced GFP, the AdEasy XL adenoviral vector system (Stratagene) was used according to the instructions provided. After preparing the primary viral stock by freeze-thawing infected AD-293 cells, the viral particles were subjected to one round of amplification. The amplified adenovirus was then used to infect four 10-cm plates of AD-293 cells and was purified using the Vivapure AdenoPACK 100 kit (Vivascience). The purified virus was resuspended in buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 25 mm NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, pH 8.0), and aliquots were stored at -80 °C. The viral titer was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. INS-1 832/13 Cell Culture and Infection—Rat INS-1 832/13 pancreatic β-cells were obtained from Dr. Chris Newgard (Duke University) and were grown as described previously (20Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). INS-1 832/13 cells (300,000 cells/well in a 12-well plate) were infected with 9 × 108 pfu/ml of Ad-GRP78, Ad-PDI, Ad-PDIm, or Ad-GFP and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2 h with gentle shaking every 30 min. The cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with fresh RPMI 1640 medium. After culturing for 24 h the cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends. Control cells were cultured under the same conditions without the addition of adenovirus. siRNA Transfection—INS-1 832/13 cells were transfected with GRP78 siRNA (Invitrogen) or control GFP siRNA (obtained from Dr. Ouathek Ouerfelli, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, per transfection 12 pmol of siRNA was diluted in 200 μl of Opti-MEM medium without serum (Invitrogen) directly in one well of a 12-well plate and mixed gently. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, 2 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) was added to each well containing the diluted siRNAs, mixed gently, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. During the incubation period, cells were diluted in medium without antibiotics to obtain a concentration of 100,000 cells/ml. To each well containing siRNA/Lipofectamine RNAiMAX complexes, 1.0 ml of the diluted cells was added (i.e. 100,000 cells/well) to obtain a final siRNA concentration of 10 nm. The cells were mixed gently and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. The cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends and processed for either Western blot analysis or insulin radioimmunoassay. Insulin Secretion Assay—Insulin secretion assays were performed after 24 h of adenoviral infection and 24 h of treatment with 5 or 25 mm glucose in RPMI 1640 medium. INS-1 832/13 cells were washed once with 2 ml of glucose-free KRBH buffer (128.8 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and then incubated in glucose-free KRBH buffer for 1 h. The cells were then washed once with KRBH and incubated with 1 ml of KRBH (2.8 mm glucose; basal) or KRBH (15 mm glucose; stimulated) for 1 h. Following the 1-h incubation, the culture plate was placed on ice, and the medium was collected for insulin radioimmunoassay (described below). The cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then transferred to a new tube, and the protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). For insulin assays, the culture media were centrifuged at 5500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and insulin present in the supernatant was measured using a rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Linco Inc.). [35S]Methionine Labeling and Proinsulin Immunoprecipitation—For Fig. 1C, INS-1 832/13 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (700,000 cells/well) the day before the experiment. The cells were then incubated in 5 or 25 mm glucose for 24 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 5 or 25 mm glucose in the presence of 100 μCi/ml of Tran35S-label (MP Biomedicals) in l-methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium for 1, 3, and 5 h at 37 °C. At the indicated time points, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 40 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and 60 μg of the cleared lysate was used for immunoprecipitation using goat polyclonal anti-rat C-peptide antibody (Linco Research Inc.) or control rabbit IgG serum. The proteins were resolved by a 4-12% NuPage gel (Invitrogen). The dried gel was exposed overnight at -80 °C to photographic film (Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax Light). RNA Isolation and Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from INS-1 832/13 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The RNA was reverse transcribed to single-stranded cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). The resulting cDNA was used for real time PCR analysis using the TaqMan Gene Expression system (Applied Biosystems). Gene-specific primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems: rat GRP78 (Rn01435771_g1), PDI (Rn00564459_ml), ATF4 (Rn00824644_gl), CHOP (Rn00492098_gl), Sel1 (Rn00710081_ml), EDEM1 (Rn01421307_ml), and insulin 2 (Rn01774648_gl). The β-actin-specific primers (rat β-actin) and TaqMan MGB probes were also obtained from Applied Biosystems. Serial dilutions of INS-1 cDNA were used to generate a standard curve. A complete real time PCR reaction (25 μl) contained 10 μl of cDNA, 1.25 μl of double-distilled H2O, 1.25 μl of TaqMan gene expression primers (20×), and 12.5 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (2×). Samples were loaded into an ABI PRISM 96-well optical reaction plate. Reactions were run on an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system using the following protocol: 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. The standard curve and corresponding values from each sample were determined by the SDS 2.1 software of the ABI Prism 7900HT instrument. Values were normalized to expression of β-actin mRNA for each species and presented as a mean ± S.E. of a minimum of three independent experiments. XBP-1 mRNA Splicing—Total RNA was isolated from INS-1 832/13 cells as described above. Rat XBP-1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR (Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit) using primers that flank the intron excised by IRE1 exonuclease activity as described previously (21Yusta B. Baggio L.L. Estall J.L. Koehler J.A. Holland D.P. Li H. Pipeleers D. Ling Z. Drucker D.J. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 391-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Primer sequences used to amplify rat XBP-1 were 5′-AAA CAG AGT AGC AGC ACA GAC TGC-3′ and 5′-TCC TTC TGG GTA GAC CTC TGG GAG-3′. The protocol used for the RT-PCR was as follows: 50 °C (30 min); 95 °C (15 min); 30 cycles of 94 °C (1 min), 62 °C (1 min), 72 °C (1 min); 72 °C (10 min). RT-PCR products were resolved on a 3% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide. Trichloroacetic Acid Protein Precipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For the experiments in Fig. 9, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline on ice, and 9% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (200 μl/well) was added. The cells were scraped into tubes and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of cold acetone and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 2× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) without reducing agent. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Following incubation with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the bands were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were scanned and quantified using Scion Image software. For detection of insulin by immunoblotting, the samples were resolved using 4-12% NuPage gels (Invitrogen). The following commercial primary antibodies were used: anti-KDEL (SPA-827, 1:1000; StressGen), PDI (SPA-890, 1:4000; StressGen), anti-phospho-eIF2α (catalog number 9721, 1:500; Cell Signaling), γ-tubulin (T6557, 1:1000; Sigma), rabbit anti-insulin (sc-9168, 1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-α-actin (CSA-400, 1:1000; StressGen), and GM130 (G65120, 1:500; Transduction Laboratories). The rabbit anti-ATF6 antibody was generated by Covance Research Inc. to a peptide sequence in the cytosolic portion of ATF6 (SENQRLKVPSPKRR) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This sequence is conserved between rodents and human ATF6. The terminal bleeds from two rabbits were pooled, and the antibody was affinity-purified by passing the serum through a column containing human GST-ATF6 cytosolic domain (amino acids 1-374) covalently coupled to glutathione-agarose beads. The antibody was eluted in glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) and neutralized with phosphate buffer. Data Analysis—Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was analyzed by Student's two-sample t test assuming equal variance or ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Prolonged Hyperglycemia Reduces Steady-state Proinsulin Levels and Increases ER Stress—Prolonged or chronic hyperglycemia is known to cause several adverse effects in pancreatic β-cells, including blunting glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and inhibiting insulin gene transcription (8Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42351-42354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 9Robertson R.P. Harmon J. Tran P.O.T. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S119-S124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects can be observed in cultured pancreatic β-cells, which have been used as models to study the effects of prolonged high glucose in vitro (13Wang H. Kouri G. Wollheim C.B. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3905-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 22Kaniuk N.A. Kiraly M. Bates H. Vranic M. Volchuk A. Brumell J.H.

Rukstalis J.M. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28858-28864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have confirmed these results using the INS-1 832/13 β-cell line. High glucose treatment for 24-48 h markedly reduced steady-state proinsulin and insulin protein levels (Fig. 1A) and insulin 2 mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). We also observed that proinsulin translation was reduced in cells exposed to chronic high glucose by measuring the incorporation of [35S]methionine into proinsulin immunoprecipitated using an anti-C-peptide antibody (Fig. 1C). We next examined whether prolonged high glucose induces ER stress by monitoring UPR pathway signaling and the levels of downstream target genes. Prolonged high glucose exposure increased the levels of spliced XBP-1 mRNA (an indicator of IRE-1 activation) (Fig. 2A), and the levels of phosphorylated eIF2α, indicative of PERK activation (Fig. 2B). We also monitored the levels of cleaved ATF6-p50 using an antibody generated to the cytosolic portion of ATF6. This antibody recognizes overexpressed cleaved (active) ATF6p50, and endogenous levels are increased by pharmacological inducers of ER stress (see Fig. S1). The levels of ATF6-p50 detected by this antibody were higher in INS-1 832/13 cells grown in prolonged high glucose conditions compared with control cells, but the difference was modest (Fig. 2C). Some downstream genes known to be induced by the UPR were increased by chronic hyperglycemia, including mRNA levels of ATF4 and CHOP (GADD153) (Fig. 2D). However, chaperone genes that are normally induced by ER stress (GRP78 and PDI) and genes associated with ERAD (SEl1 and EDEM1) were not affected or actually decreased by prolonged hyperglycemia (Fig. 2D). Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, increased the levels of these proteins, as expected. Thus, it appears that some genes that would normally be induced by ER stress are not increased under hyperglycemic conditions. Combined, these results indicate that the UPR pathways are activated in cells that are cultured in prolonged hyperglycemic conditions, although not all downstream target genes are induced. Overexpression of GRP78 Increases Steady-state Proinsulin Levels and Improves Glucose-stimulated Insulin Secretion—Prolonged high glucose may perturb normal ER function, which could contribute to detrimental effects on insulin biosynthesis. ER stress is sensed both by the detection of unfolded proteins directly and by GRP78 interaction with ER stress sensors (14Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether manipulating cellular GRP78 levels could affect insulin biosynthesis and secretion in the presence of prolonged hyperglycemia. We overexpressed GRP78 in INS-1 832/13 cells by adenoviral transduction and monitored the effect on proinsulin and insulin levels in control cells and cells exposed to prolonged high glucose. In these experiments, we also expressed a control protein GFP and the ER chaperone and oxidoreductase PDI by adenovirus transduction. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment of cells with high glucose for 24-48 h reduced steady-state insulin levels in control cells and cells expressing the various proteins. However, in cells overexpressing GRP78 or PDI, the levels of proinsulin in both control (5 mm) and high glucose-treated cells was higher compared with GFP-expressing or uninfected cells (Fig. 3, A, B, and E). Interestingly, overexpression of PDI increased the steady-state intracellular proinsulin levels to a greater extent than overexpression of GRP78, particularly under high glucose conditions. Thus, it appears that increasing chaperone capacity can increase the amount of cellular proinsulin even in the face of prolonged hyperglycemia. The increase in steady-state proinsulin levels is likely to occur at either the translational level or enhanced protein folding, since the reduction in insulin mRNA in response to prolonged high glucose exposure was not affected by either GRP78 or PDI overexpression (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Overexpression of GRP78 or PDI does not affect hyperglycemia-induced reduction of insulin 2 mRNA levels. INS-1 832/13 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing GFP, GRP78, or PDI as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” After 24 h, the cells were treated with 5 or 25 mm glucose for 24 h. Following the treatments, total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed to single-stranded cDNA and analyzed by real time PCR using primers specific for rat insulin 2 or β-actin. Results are expressed as insulin 2 mRNA relative to actin, and shown are the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. (*, p < 0.05; 25 mm versus 5 mm glucose for each condition; Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also examined if overexpressing GRP78 affected insulin secretion in INS-1 832/13 cells. Cells were infected and kept at low (5 mm) glucose for 24 h, after which 1-h static glucose-stimulated secretion experiments were performed at basal (2.8 mm) and stimulatory (15 mm) glucose concentrations. Under these experimental conditions, we observed an ∼10-fold increase in insulin secreted into the media at stimulatory glucose, but there was no difference in insulin secretion between control cells (uninfected or GFP-infected) and GRP78 overexpressing cells (results not shown). Control and infected cells were also pretreated with hyperglycemic conditions (25 mm glucose) for 24 h prior to insulin secretion experiments. Under these conditions glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was markedly reduced (<2-fold 15 mm glucose versus 2.8 mm glucose). However, cells overexpressing GRP78 had significantly better glucose-stimulated insulin secretion compared with controls (Fig. 5). The -fold difference in insulin secretion between stimulated (15 mm) and basal (2.8 mm) glucose was 2.0 ± 0.27 in GRP78-expressing cells compared with 1.51 ± 0.14 in GFP-expressing cells. Thus, enhancing chaperone capacity by increasing GRP78 levels increases proinsulin levels and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the face of prolonged hyperglycemia. Unexpectedly, insulin secretion at basal glucose and under glucose-stimulated conditions was markedly reduced in PDI-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5). Protein folding can be enhanced by small molecule chemical chaperones, such as sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) (25Welch W.J. Brown R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The presence of PBA, but not an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, increased proinsulin expression, showing that improving chaperone capacity can enhance steady-state proinsulin levels under hyperglycemic conditions (Fig. 6). Although PBA clearly increased steady-state proinsulin levels, there was no significant effect on cellular processed B-chain insulin levels, as measured by Western blotting. In fact, B-chain insulin levels were reduced in PBA-treated cells under basal glucose levels (Fig. 6A). We also examined the effect of reducing endogenous GRP78 expression on insulin levels and secretion in cells grown under basal glucose conditions. Knocking down endogenous GRP78 expression by >50% resulted in a marked reduction in steady-state proinsulin and processed insulin levels (Fig. 7A) and reduced basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 7B). Thus, GRP78 is critical for maintaining normal insulin levels and secretion in INS-1 832/13 β-cells. Since overexpression of GRP78 reduces the effects of prolonged hyperglycemia on proinsulin levels and insulin secretion, we examined if GRP78 overexpression also reduces ER stress. However, under the experimental conditions tested (24 or 48 h of high glucose exposure) we were unable to detect any significant differences in XBP-1 splicing (i.e. XBP-1 splicing still occurred in GRP78-overexpressing cells) (results not shown). In addition, overexpressing GRP78 failed to reduce CHOP mRNA levels induced by prolonged high glucose exposure (see Fig. 10B). Thus, GRP78 overexpression is not sufficient to completely relieve ER stress in the continued presence of high glucose. Overexpression of PDI Alters Normal Proinsulin Disulfide Bond Formation and Induces Some Markers of ER Stress—Unexpectedly, despite increasing steady-state proinsulin levels (Fig. 3), overexpressing PDI markedly reduced insulin secretion (Fig. 5). We surmised that overexpression of PDI may alter the normal balance of disulfide bond formation and possibly impede proinsulin folding. We examined this hypothesis by overexpressing a mutant v"
https://openalex.org/W2012427837,"Background Cancer patients carrying mutations in the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD) have a high risk to experience severe drug-adverse effects following chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine drugs such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine. The pretreatment detection of this impairment of pyrimidine catabolism could prevent serious, potentially lethal side effects. As known deleterious mutations explain only a limited proportion of the drug-adverse events, we systematically searched for additional DPYD variations associated with enhanced drug toxicity. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a whole gene approach covering the entire coding region and compared DPYD genotype frequencies between cancer patients with good (n = 89) and with poor (n = 39) tolerance of a fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen. Applying logistic regression analysis and sliding window approaches we identified the strongest association with fluoropyrimidine-related grade III and IV toxicity for the non-synonymous polymorphism c.496A>G (p.Met166Val). We then confirmed our initial results using an independent sample of 53 individuals suffering from drug-adverse-effects. The combined odds ratio calculated for 92 toxicity cases was 4.42 [95% CI 2.12–9.23]; p (trend)<0.001; p (corrected) = 0.001; the attributable risk was 56.9%. Comparing tumor-type matched sets of samples, correlation of c.496A>G with toxicity was particularly present in patients with gastroesophageal and breast cancer, but did not reach significance in patients with colorectal malignancies. Conclusion Our results show compelling evidence that, at least in distinct tumor types, a common DPYD polymorphism strongly contributes to the occurrence of fluoropyrimidine-related drug adverse effects. Carriers of this variant could benefit from individual dose adjustment of the fluoropyrimidine drug or alternate therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1974204803,"Background Malaria and anaemia are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa. We have investigated the effect of intermittent preventive treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine or artesunate plus amodiaquine on anaemia and malaria in children in an area of intense, prolonged, seasonal malaria transmission in Ghana. Methods 2451 children aged 3–59 months from 30 villages were individually randomised to receive placebo or artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS+AQ) monthly or bimonthly, or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) bimonthly over a period of six months. The primary outcome measures were episodes of anaemia (Hb<8.0 g/dl) or malaria detected through passive surveillance. Findings Monthly artesunate plus amodiaquine reduced the incidence of malaria by 69% (95% CI: 63%, 74%) and anaemia by 45% (95% CI: 25%,60%), bimonthly sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine reduced the incidence of malaria by 24% (95% CI: 14%,33%) and anaemia by 30% (95% CI: 6%, 49%) and bimonthly artesunate plus amodiaquine reduced the incidence of malaria by 17% (95% CI: 6%, 27%) and anaemia by 32% (95% CI: 7%, 50%) compared to placebo. There were no statistically significant reductions in the episodes of all cause or malaria specific hospital admissions in any of the intervention groups compared to the placebo group. There was no significant increase in the incidence of clinical malaria in the post intervention period in children who were >1 year old when they received IPTc compared to the placebo group. However the incidence of malaria in the post intervention period was higher in children who were <1 year old when they received AS+AQ monthly compared to the placebo group. Interpretation IPTc is safe and efficacious in reducing the burden of malaria in an area of Ghana with a prolonged, intense malaria transmission season.

Abnormal expression of CXCR4 contributes to cancer and inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Although ligand-dependent CXCR4 ubiquitination is known to accelerate CXCR4 degradation, little is known about counter mechanisms for receptor deubiquitination. CXCL12, a CXCR4 agonist, induces a time-dependent association of USP14 with CXCR4, or its C terminus, that is not mimicked by USP2A, USP4, or USP7, other members of the deubiquitination catalytic family. Co-localization of CXCR4 and USP14 also is time-dependent following CXCL12 stimulation. The physical interaction of CXCR4 and USP14 is paralleled by USP14-catalyzed deubiquitination of the receptor; knockdown of endogenous USP14 by RNA interference (RNAi) blocks CXCR4 deubiquitination, whereas overexpression of USP14 promotes CXCR4 deubiquitination. We also observed that ubiquitination of CXCR4 facilitated receptor degradation, whereas overexpression of USP14 or RNAi-induced knockdown of USP14 blocked CXCL12-mediated CXCR4 degradation. Most interestingly, CXCR4-mediated chemotactic cell migration was blocked by either overexpression or RNAi-mediated knockdown of USP14, implying that a CXCR4-ubiquitin cycle on the receptor, rather than a particular ubiquitinated state of the receptor, is critical for the ligand gradient sensing and directed motility required for chemokine-mediated chemotaxis. Our observation that a mutant of CXCR4, HA-3K/R CXCR4, which cannot be ubiquitinated and does not mediate a chemotactic response to CXCL12, indicates the importance of this covalent modification not only in marking receptors for degradation but also for permitting CXCR4-mediated signaling.

Ligand stimulation of CXCR4 also induces endocytosis of these receptors, which are targeted to lysosomes for degradation through a pathway involving ubiquitination of the C-terminal lysine residues (28Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). CXCR4 ubiquitination can be catalyzed by a member of the HECT family of E3 ligases, AIP4 (atrophin-interacting protein 4) (29Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar, 30Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. StenMark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The ubiquitinated CXCR4 is delivered to the endosomal compartments via a regulated pathway involving several adaptor proteins (31Bhandari D. Trejo J. Benovic J.L. Marchese A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36971-36979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It has been noted that deubiquitination also regulates the fate and function of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Deubiquitinating enzymes, which catalyze the removal of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, represent the largest family of enzymes in the ubiquitin system, implying the possibility that substrate selectivity is even greater for these enzymes than for those that catalyze ubiquitin ligation. Little is known about the mechanisms of CXCR4 deubiquitination and their regulation by receptor ligands. A proteomics study revealed that the steady state level of USP14 was increased upon CXCL12 stimulation of target cells (32Ding Y. Zhang L. Goodwin J.S. Wang Z. Liu B. Zhang J. Fan G.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 590-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and preliminary studies revealed that ligand stimulation led to enhanced association of USP14 with the CXCR4. The present studies were undertaken to ascertain the functional consequences of this interaction, the selectivity of CXCR4 for USP14, when compared with three other deubiquitinating enzymes, USP2a, USP4, and USP7, and the impact of modifying the ubiquitinated state of the receptor on CXCR4 turnover, CXCL12-evoked chemotaxis, and CXCL12-induced activation of ERK. Plasmids and siRNAs—Plasmids encoding Myc-CXCR4 and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-conjugated CXCR4 C terminus were obtained from Dr. Gang Pei (Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences). The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-conjugated CXCR4 was constructed by amplifying the cDNAs of CXCR4 from HA-CXCR4 in pcDNA3 vector using PCR and inserting the cDNA into the XhoI and BamHI sites of the pEGFP/N1 vector (Clontech). The epitope-tagged CXCR4 has been tested by radioligand binding assay and cyclic AMP assay and was confirmed to function similarly as the nontagged receptor (data not shown). The mutant CXCR4 that cannot be recognized for ubiquitination (HA-3K/R CXCR4) was obtained from Dr. Jeffrey L. Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia) (28Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The USP14 plasmid was constructed by PCR amplification of USP14 cDNA using lymphocyte cDNAs as template and inserted into the pcDNA3 vector. Pre-designed USP14-specific siRNA and pre-designed control (scramble) siRNA were purchased from Ambion. The USP2a plasmid was obtained from Dr. Massimo Loda (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston). The USP4 plasmid was obtained from Dr. Michael Freissmuth (Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria). The pCI-USP7 plasmid was a gift from Dr. Roger Everett (Institute of Virology, University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK). The pcDNA3-USP7 was constructed by amplifying the cDNAs of USP7 in pCI vector using PCR and inserting the cDNA into the XhoI and BamHI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes. For studies involving fluorescence microscopy, 22-mm square glass coverslips were placed in the culture dishes before transfection. Transient transfection of recipient HEK293 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4 or EGFP-CXCR4 were selected with 560 μg/ml geneticin (G418). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot for Determining CXCR4 Complexes—HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4 were transiently transfected with HA-USP14 or USP14-specific siRNA, treated with CXCL12 (10 nm; Pepro-Tech, Inc.) for various time intervals, and lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer containing PBS (pH.7.0), 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.01% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40 to which additional SDS was added to bring the final concentration to ∼10%. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant was pre-cleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding. After removing the protein A/G-agarose by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 1 min), the cleared supernatant was collected, and 10 μl of mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added for an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Protein A/G (40 μl) was then added to this mixture, and the incubation was continued for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein A/G-antibody-antigen complex was collected by centrifugation and washing the pelleted resin three times with ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer. The final pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 50 °C for 10 min. Forty microliters of this preparation were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The PAGE-embedded proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by electrophoretic transfer at 60 V for 60 min at 4 °C in a buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol). Proteins were identified on the nitrocellulose filter by Western blotting, using the following antibodies. CXCR4 was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the Myc epitope in the N-terminal domain of the receptor. USP14 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abgent). USP2a and USP7 were detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) directed against the HA epitope engineered into the N terminus of the protein. USP4 was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) directed against the His epitope engineered into the N terminus of the protein. In Vitro Binding Assay for Protein Association with the C Terminus of CXCR4—For isolating proteins that interact with the CXCR4 C terminus, we exploited a GST-CXCR4 C-terminal fusion protein, using GST alone as a control. For the purification of the GST or GST-CXCR4 C-terminal fusion proteins, DH5α bacteria transformed with plasmids encoding GST or GST-CXCR4 C-terminal fusion proteins were cultured overnight at 37 °C. Isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture to induce protein expression, and incubation was continued for another 3 h. The bacteria were lysed in PBST buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and then probe-sonicated on ice for 10 s. The supernatant of the bacterial lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Pierce/Thermo Scientific, Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C to isolate GST or the GST-CXCR4 C-terminal fusion protein. After washing three times with PBST buffer, the purified GST- or GST-CXCR4 C-terminal fusion protein-bound beads were resuspended in PBST buffer and stored on ice until use that day. Cell lysates that were to be incubated with Sepharose-GST or Sepharose-GST-CXCR4 C terminus were prepared in the following way. HEK293 cells not expressing CXCR4 (and not stimulated with CXCL12) but transiently expressing HA-USP14, HA-USP2a, HIS-USP4, or HA-USP7 (with parental cells serving as controls) were lysed using PBST buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) 48 h after transfection. Cell lysates were pelleted to remove debris (13,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge), and the supernatants of this centrifugation were used for the GST pulldown assay. For the GST pulldown assay, the supernatant of the cell lysates was incubated with aliquots of the purified GST or GST-CXCR4 C-terminal fusion proteins (to bring the GST fusion protein concentration to 50 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. To terminate the incubation, Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 2 min) and washed four times with PBST buffer. Proteins bound to the C-terminal CXCR4 receptor-GST fusions protein (or control GST) were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot, as outlined above. Confocal Microscopy—Our initial studies revealed a selectively greater association of CXCR4 with USP14 compared with other family members; thus, most of our studies focused on CXCR4 and its association with USP14. To examine the localization of USP14 compared with CXCR4 in cells expressing both, HEK293 cells stably expressing EGFP-CXCR4 were transiently transfected with HA-USP14 and grown on coverslips for 1 or 2 days. Cells were treated with CXCL12 (10 nm) for various time intervals and fixed with 100% methanol at room temperature before immediate transfer to 4 °C until further processing. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated with a mouse monoclonal HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with a CY3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature and then washed twice with PBS and then briefly with deionized water to remove buffer salts. Coverslips were mounted on the microscope slide with a mounting solution. Confocal microscopy was performed on an LSM-510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, New York) with a 63 × 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion lens using dual excitation (488 nm for EGFP and 568 nm for Cy3) and emission (515-540 nm for EGFP and 590-610 nm for Cy3) filter sets. All digital images were captured at the same settings to allow direct quantitative comparison of staining patterns. Final images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Time Course of CXCR4 Ubiquitination and Deubiquitination—To assess whether ligand activation of CXCR4 altered the ubiquitination of this receptor, HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4 were incubated with 10 nm CXCL12 for the time intervals indicated in the figures and figure legends. The cells were then lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant was pre-cleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding. After removing the protein A/G-agarose by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 1 min), the cleared supernatant was collected, and 10 μl of mouse monoclonal Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Protein A/G (40 μl) was then added, and the incubation was continued for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein A/G-antibody-antigen complex was then collected by centrifugation, as above, and was washed three times with ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer. The final pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 50 °C for 10 min. Forty microliters of this preparation were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), as described in detail above for Western blotting. The state of ubiquitination of the CXCR4 receptor was detected by Western blot analysis using a rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Two complementary strategies were used to determine the effect of USP14 on CXCR4 modification, i.e. overexpression of USP14 in CXCR4-expressing HEK293 cells and RNA silencing of endogenous USP14 in cells expressing CXCR4. For USP14 overexpression, cells were transiently transfected with vector (control) or HA-USP14 (see under “Cell Culture and Transfection”) and incubated with ligand 48 h later. For knockdown of USP14, cells were transiently transfected with scrambled siRNA (control) or USP14-siRNA (Ambion, Inc.). In either case, cells were incubated with CXCL12 for 10 min to assess the impact of ligand on the ubiquitination of CXCR4. To assess the reversibility of the ubiquitination, another set of cells was incubated for 10 min with CXCL12 followed by a 60-min “recovery from stimulation” period (after removal of ligand and replacement of fresh medium after the 10 min of stimulation). Incubations were terminated by cell lysis in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer. The cells were processed as described above for assessment of CXCR4 ubiquitination. Receptor Degradation Assay—To assess the impact of USP14 and reversal of ubiquitination on CXCR4 turnover and degradation, HEK293 cells expressing CXCR4 and transiently expressing HA-USP14 (see figure legends) were pretreated with cycloheximide (5 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C to prevent new protein synthesis during the course of our experiments. Cells were incubated with CXCL12 (10 nm) for 8 h at 37 °C to maximally induce receptor ubiquitination and degradation. To terminate the incubation, cells were transferred to ice and then lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer. Lysates containing equal amounts of proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. CXCR4 was detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-CXCR4 antibody (Abcam). The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-tubulin antibody to confirm equal loading (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To assess the effect of USP14 modulation on endogenous CXCR4 turnover and degradation, HeLa cells, which endogenously express CXCR4, were transiently transfected with HA-USP14 or USP14-specific siRNA. Cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (5 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, to prevent new protein synthesis during the course of our experiments, and incubated with CXCL12 (10 nm) for varying time points at 37 °C (see figure legends). To terminate the incubation, cells were transferred to ice and then lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer. Lysates containing equal amounts of proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. CXCR4 was detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-CXCR4 antibody (Abcam). The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-tubulin antibody to confirm equal loading (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Densitometric Analysis of Western Blot Bands—The relative amount of all Western blot bands was measured using UNSCAN-IT gel version 6.1 (Silk Scientific Corp.). The relative density of the protein bands was calculated in the area encompassing the immunoreactive protein band following subtraction of the density of the background signal detected in an adjacent area without protein signal in the same lane as the protein of interest. Statistical Analysis—Student's t tests were performed to test statistical significance for the paired data comparisons. Analysis of variance tests were used to test the significant differences for the group data comparisons. Chemotaxis Assay—The migration of HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-CXCR4 and transiently expressing vector alone (control), HA-USP14, USP14-specific siRNA, or scrambled (control) siRNA was evaluated using a chemotaxis assay (36Luo C. Pan H. Mines M. Watson K. Zhang J. Fan G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30081-30093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, polycarbonate filters (10-μm pore size) coated with 20 μg/μl human collagen type IV were placed between the upper and lower compartments of the Boyden chambers (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD). The lower compartment of the chamber was loaded with 400-μl aliquots of 1 mg/ml ovalbumin/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (chemotaxis buffer) or CXCL12 (0.01-100 nm) diluted in chemotaxis buffer. Cells (5 × 105/100 μl) were loaded into the upper compartment and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells that had migrated through the filter into the bottom chamber of medium or medium containing CXCL12 were counted under the microscope (×20 objective) after being stained with a Diff-Quik kit. The migration index was calculated and was defined as number of cells crossing the filter toward CXCL12 (various concentrations)/number of cells migrating toward medium alone (control). Each experiment was performed at least three times in duplicate. To confirm that the modulation of chemotaxis was being mediated via the receptor itself, and not some other USP14-interacting protein, and to confirm the necessity of a ubiquitination/deubiquitination cycle, we assessed the effect of CXCL12 stimulation on mutant CXCR4-mediated, HA-3K/R CXCR4, cell migration. As such, the chemotactic index of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HA-WT CXCR4 or HA-3K/R CXCR4 was calculated as described above. CXCL12-induced CXCR4-mediated ERK Activation—To exploit a possible mechanism for the inhibition of CXCL12-induced CXCR4-mediated cell chemotaxis, we explored possible changes in the activation of ERK, a signaling molecule located downstream of CXCR4 activation. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HA-WT CXCR4 or HA-3K/R CXCR4 were stimulated with CXCL12 (10 nm) for varying time points (see figure legends) at 37 °C. Stimulation was terminated by transferring cells to ice and then lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer. Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and activated ERK was detected using an anti-P-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were stripped and reprobed with an antibody (anti-ERK2 antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that recognizes ERK in both its phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated states to confirm equal loading. An anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was also employed to detect the level of expression of HA-CXCR4. CXCL12 Activation Leads to a Time-dependent Association of USP14 with CXCR4—A previous series of experiments revealed the possibility that USP14 was a CXCR4-interacting protein (37Ding Y. Li M. Zhang J. Li N. Xia Z. Hu Y. Wang S. Fan G.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This study verified that CXCL12 incubation of HEK293 cells stably expressing the receptor and transiently expressing HA-USP14 leads to a time-dependent association of USP14 with CXCR4 (Fig. 1A). USP14 association with CXCR4 was not readily detected before ligand stimulation, but exposure of CXCR4-expressing cells to CXCL12 led to detection of USP14 association with the receptor at the earliest time point evaluated (2 min). Association continued for ∼5 min, after which time detectable receptor-dependent association declined (Fig. 1B), despite sustained receptor expression in the cells (Fig. 1A). It was not necessary to overexpress USP14 to detect this interaction, because a similar time course for CXCL12-induced association of USP14 with myc-CXCR4 was also detected in HEK cells expressing endogenous USP14 (data not shown). Of further interest was our finding that USP14 interaction with CXCR4 is relatively selective, compared with other members of the USP family, includ"
https://openalex.org/W2049595150,"Galectin-1 (Gal-1) regulates leukocyte turnover by inducing the cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), a ligand that targets cells for phagocytic removal, in the absence of apoptosis. Gal-1 monomer-dimer equilibrium appears to modulate Gal-1-induced PS exposure, although the mechanism underlying this regulation remains unclear. Here we show that monomer-dimer equilibrium regulates Gal-1 sensitivity to oxidation. A mutant form of Gal-1, containing C2S and V5D mutations (mGal-1), exhibits impaired dimerization and fails to induce cell surface PS exposure while retaining the ability to recognize carbohydrates and signal Ca(2+) flux in leukocytes. mGal-1 also displayed enhanced sensitivity to oxidation, whereas ligand, which partially protected Gal-1 from oxidation, enhanced Gal-1 dimerization. Continual incubation of leukocytes with Gal-1 resulted in gradual oxidative inactivation with concomitant loss of cell surface PS, whereas rapid oxidation prevented mGal-1 from inducing PS exposure. Stabilization of Gal-1 or mGal-1 with iodoacetamide fully protected Gal-1 and mGal-1 from oxidation. Alkylation-induced stabilization allowed Gal-1 to signal sustained PS exposure in leukocytes and mGal-1 to signal both Ca(2+) flux and PS exposure. Taken together, these results demonstrate that monomer-dimer equilibrium regulates Gal-1 sensitivity to oxidative inactivation and provides a mechanism whereby ligand partially protects Gal-1 from oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W2031565553,"Because of localized vascular damage and increased tissue oxygen demand, wound healing occurs in a relatively hypoxic microenvironment. These features are particularly relevant to wound healing and fibrosis in chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In these studies, we sought to identify the contribution of hypoxia to mechanisms of wound repair in a model of the intestinal submucosa. Initial studies revealed that hypoxia promotes wound healing, as modeled by an increase in intestinal fibroblast-mediated collagen gel contraction. Guided by results from transcriptional profiling, we identified the selective induction of fibroblast integrin beta1 (ITGB1) by hypoxia. Further analysis revealed that hypoxia, as well as pharmacological activators of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), induce fibroblast beta1 integrin mRNA, protein, and function by as much as 4-fold. Cloning and analysis of the beta1 integrin gene promoter revealed a 10 +/- 0.8-fold increase in promoter activity in response to hypoxia, and subsequent studies identified a functional DNA binding region for HIF in the ITGB1 gene promoter. Mutational analysis of the HIF binding site within the ITGB1 promoter resulted in a significant loss of ITGB1 hypoxia-inducibility. As proof of principle, studies in a murine model of colitis revealed a correlation between colitic disease severity and tissue ITGB1 expression (R(2)=0.80). Taken together, these results demonstrate that hypoxia induces fibroblast ITGB1 expression and function by transcriptional mechanisms dependent on HIF."
https://openalex.org/W2013800871,"MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are dual specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate and thereby inactivate MAPKs. In the present study, we provide evidence that platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) regulates MKP3 (DUSP6), which is considered to be a phosphatase highly selective for Erk. Intriguingly, we observed that Mek is positively regulated by MKP3, whereas Erk itself is negatively regulated. In addition, we found that activation of PDGF receptor α or β leads to a rapid proteasomal degradation of MKP3 in a manner that requires Mek activation; this feed-forward mechanism was found to be essential for efficient Erk phosphorylation. We could also demonstrate that PDGF-BB stimulation induces phosphorylation of MKP3 at Ser-174 and Ser-300; phosphorylation of Ser-174 is involved in PDGF-induced MKP3 degradation, since mutation of this site stabilized MKP3. Moreover, activated Erk induces mkp3 expression, leading to restoration of MKP3 levels after 1-2 h and a concomitant dephosphorylation of Erk in cells with activated PDGFRα. Reducing the MKP3 level by small interfering RNA leads to an increased Erk activation and mitogenic response to PDGF-BB. In conclusion, MKP3 is an important regulator of PDGF-induced Erk phosphorylation acting in both a rapid positive feed-forward and a later negative feed-back loop.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) 2The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, PDGF receptor; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; Mek, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 2The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, PDGF receptor; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; Mek, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. stimulates migration and proliferation of connective tissue cells and has an important role during embryonic development and wound healing (1Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). The biologically active form of PDGF is a disulfide-bonded dimer of A-, B-, C-, or D-polypeptide chains (2Fredriksson L. Li H. Eriksson U. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The PDGF isoforms (PDGF-AA, -AB, -BB, -CC, or -DD) bind two structurally related tyrosine kinase receptors, denoted PDGFRα and -β. PDGF-A, -B, and -C chains bind to PDGFRα, and PDGF-B and -D chains bind to PDGFRβ. Ligand binding induces receptor homo- or heterodimerization and autophosphorylation. The phosphorylated tyrosine residues constitute recruitment sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, including the Grb2-Sos complex that activates Ras and the Erk MAPK pathway, the tyrosine kinase Src, the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase Cγ;in addition, the PDGFRβ but not PDGFRα binds RasGAP, which inactivates Ras (1Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 3Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). These pathways mediate cell growth, survival, and migration.The MAPK family is evolutionarily conserved, and mammalian cells possess several MAPK pathways (i.e. Erk1 and -2; p38α,-β,-δ, and -γ; and JNK1, -2, and -3) (4Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar, 5Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3438) Google Scholar). The Erk pathway has been connected to cell proliferation and differentiation (6Yoon S. Seger R. Growth Factors. 2006; 24: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the p38 and JNK pathways have more established roles in apoptotic signaling but may under certain circumstances also contribute to cell proliferation and migration (7Dent P. Yacoub A. Fisher P.B. Hagan M.P. Grant S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5885-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Receptor tyrosine kinases often activate the Erk pathway by recruiting a complex between the adaptor protein Grb2 and the guanine exchange factor Sos to the plasma membrane, where it activates the small G-protein Ras, which then activates the three-tiered kinase module consisting of Raf, Mek, and Erk (6Yoon S.

A large portion of human tumors have deregulated Erk kinase activity, underscoring its importance in tumor formation (8Hoshino R. Chatani Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Oka H. Yoshida O. Shimada Y. Ari-i S. Wada H. Fujimoto J. Kohno M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Unrestrained Erk kinase activity can arise from inappropriate activation of an upstream signaling component (e.g. oncogenic Ras) or loss of an inhibitory regulator, such as MAPK phosphatases.The biological consequence of Erk activation is connected to the magnitude as well as temporal pattern of Erk phosphorylation. For example, in PC12 cells, sustained Erk activation induced by nerve growth factor leads to differentiation, whereas transient EGF-induced Erk phosphorylation results in proliferation (9Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that sustained Erk activation is necessary for cell cycle progression (10Cook S.J.

Thus, mechanisms that regulate the kinetics of Erk activation have a major biological impact, although there is significant cell type specificity regarding the outcome.MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are dual specificity phosphatases that negatively regulate the activity of MAPKs by dephosphorylating the essential threonine and tyrosine residues in the activation loop (13Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 14Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Treatment with growth factors, such as NGF, induces MKP expression (15Camps M. Chabert C. Muda M. Boschert U. Gillieron C. Arkinstall S.

The different MKPs have distinct substrate specificities (i.e. selectively dephosphorylating Erk, p38, or JNK MAPKs), enabling the cell to specifically control different MAPK pathways (14Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have explored the role of MKPs in PDGF-induced Erk activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Recombinant human PDGF-BB was generously provided by Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). The inhibitor U0126 was from Calbiochem, MG132 and cycloheximide from Sigma and STI571 from Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland). Monoclonal β-actin antibody was from Sigma (A5441), and antibodies against phosphorylated-Mek1/2 (number 9154), total Mek1/2 (number 9126), and phosphorylated Erk1/2 (number 9106) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99, sc-7029) and anti-ubiquitin (P4D1, sc-8017) antisera were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antiserum against MKP3 was raised by immunizing a rabbit with the synthetic peptide CPSNQNVYQVDSLQST conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibodies were purified by chromatography over a column of the corresponding peptide immobilized on Sepharose beads. Purified antibodies were stored in 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50% glycerol at -70 °C. A rabbit antiserum recognizing Erk was raised against a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal sequence EETARF-QPGYRS conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum against PDGFRβ was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal amino acid residues of PDGFRβ. A rabbit antiserum recognizing PDGFRα was generated using a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1066-1084 in the human PDGFRα. The MKP3 expression construct was a kind gift of Dr. Stephen Keyse (University of Dundee), and the FLAG-ubiquitin expression construct was a kind gift from Dr Maréne Landström (Uppsala University). [32P]orthophosphate (PBS43) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). In brief, two complementary oligonucleotides containing the mutation of interest were synthesized and used in the mutagenesis PCR with the wild-type MKP3 DNA as a template. The amplification mixtures were then digested with DpnI to remove template DNA. The non-digested DNA was transformed into DH5α bacteria from which the mutated DNA could be recovered. All point mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The following oligonucleotides were used: Ser-159 → Ala, CTCGTGTAGCAGCAGCGCGCCGCCGTTGCCAGTG and CACTGGCAACGGCGGAGCGCTGCTGCTACACGAG; Ser-174 → Ala, GGCCTGCGGATCAGCGCTGACTCTTCCTCGGACATC and GATGTCCGAGGAAGAGTCAGCGCTGATCCGCAGGCC; Ser-197 → Ala, CAACAGACTCGGATGGTGCTCCGCTGTCCAACAGC and GCTGTTGGACAGCGGAGCACCATCCGAGTCTGTTG; Ser-300 → Ala, CTTGGCTGGCATTAGCCGCGCAGTCACTGTGACTGTGGC and GCCACAGTCACAGTGACTGCGCGGCTAATGCCAGCCAAG; Cys-293 → Ala, CTGTGGTGTCTTGGTACATGCCTTGGCTGGCATTAGCCG and CGGCTAATGCCAGCCAAGGCATGTACCAAGACACCACAG.Cell Culture—Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) and 293T cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium with l-glutamine or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For serum starvation, cells were washed once and incubated in Ham's F-12 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% or 0.1% fetal bovine serum, respectively.Transient Transfections—Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells were used for experiments 48 h after transfection.Immunoblotting—Subconfluent cells were starved and incubated with inhibitors or vehicle at the indicated concentrations and thereafter stimulated with 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB for the indicated periods of time. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm Pefa Bloc, 1% Trasylol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). Equal amounts of lysates were boiled with SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol and separated by SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, samples were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P), which were blocked in 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween 20. Commercial primary antibodies were used at concentrations recommended by the suppliers, and antibodies produced in house were used at 2 μg/ml and incubated overnight in the cold. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (both from Amersham Biosciences), and proteins were visualized using ECL Western blotting detection systems from Roche Applied Science on a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Fuji, Minami-Ashigata, Japan). For reprobing, membranes were stripped with 0.4 m NaOH for 10 min at room temperature, blocked, and incubated with the corresponding antibodies. Where quantifications of band intensities are shown, the number corresponds to the average value ± S.E.[32P]Orthophosphate Labeling—Cells were starved for 16 h, preincubated for 3 h with 4 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free Ham's F-12 supplemented with 0.3% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and then stimulated with PDGF-BB for 15 min. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody recognizing MKP3.Phosphopeptide Mapping, Edman Degradation, and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Phosphopeptide mapping, Edman degradation, and phosphoamino acid analysis were performed essentially as described (18Blume-Jensen P. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. Ronnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14192-14200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In brief, tryptic peptides were recovered from the nitrocellulose membrane and separated on a Hunter thin layer electrophoresis system (HTLE-700) at 2000 V for 35 min in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid/acetic acid/water, 4.6/15.6/18, v/v/v), followed by chromatography in isobutyric acid buffer (isobutyric acid/n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/acetic acid/water, 1250/38/96/58/558, v/v/v/v/v) in the second dimension. Phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography, extracted with 20% acetonitrile, and coupled to Sequelon™-AA membrane (Millipore). Edman degradation was performed using an Applied Biosystems gas phase sequencer (model 477A). Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by hydrolysis of phosphoproteins using 6 m HCl at 110 °C, followed by separation in two dimensions, first at pH 1.9 and then at pH 3.5 (acetic acid/pyridine/water, 100/10/1890, v/v/v) buffer together with phosphoamino acid standards using HTLE-700.Real Time PCR—Total DNA-free cellular RNA was extracted from cells treated with PDGF for different periods of time with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed (SuperScript II RNase; Invitrogen) to create cDNA templates. The PCR was performed by the qPCR™ core kit for SYBR™ Green I (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an endogenous control for the relative quantification of the target message. Specific primers were as follows: for mkp3, GTTTTTCCCTGAGGCCATTTC (forward) and TCACAGTGACTGAGCGGCTAAT (reverse); for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, CCCTTCATTGACCTCCACTACAT (forward) and GGGATTTCCATTGATGACAAG (reverse).siRNA Knockdown—Down-regulation of MKP3 was performed by using specific siRNA purchased from Dharmacon Research. For every experiment performed, nontargeting siRNA was used as a control (target sequence 5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′). Transfection of siRNA was done for 24 h with SilentFect from Bio-Rad. Levels of knockdown were tested after 40 h by measuring protein levels by immunoblotting.DNA Synthesis Assay—The cells plated into 24-well plates were serum-starved and then incubated for 24 h with PDGF-BB in Ham's F-12 containing [3H]thymidine (0.1 μCi/ml). Thymidine incorporation into acid-insoluble material was measured by a scintillation counter.Extraction of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Fractions—293T cells were washed with PBS, collected by scraping, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed in buffer containing 10 mm MES (pH 6.2), 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm Pefa Bloc, 1% Trasylol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g and then lysed in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 10.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitors. Supernatants containing nuclei proteins were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min.Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used to determine p values, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSPDGFRα and PDGFRβ Activate Erk with Different Kinetics—PAE cells transfected with PDGFRα or PDGFRβ (denoted PAE/PDGFRα and PAE/PDGFRβ, respectively) were used to investigate Erk activation downstream of the two PDGFR isoforms expressed at a comparable level in the same cellular background. Cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB, which binds with similar affinity to both PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, and the phosphorylation of Erk was analyzed at different points by immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibodies. We found that the kinetics of PDGF-BB-induced Erk phosphorylation was different, depending on which PDGFR isoform was expressed. In PAE/PDGFRα cells, a biphasic activation was observed with an initial peak of Erk phosphorylation after 15 min, followed by a sharp decrease and a later second increase after 4 h of stimulation (Fig. 1A, upper panels). In contrast, activation of PDGFRβ resulted in Erk phosphorylation that peaked after ∼30 min of stimulation and then remained relatively constant at a lower level up to 6 h of stimulation (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Next, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of the upstream kinase Mek. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, Mek was transiently activated downstream of PDGFRα and more sustained downstream of PDGFRβ, consistent with the initial kinetics of Erk activation. For reference, the kinetics of PDGFRα and -β phosphorylation was also included in Fig. 1C.PDGF-BB Regulates the Expression Level of MAPK Phosphatase 3—In order to investigate whether the initial rapid increase of Erk phosphorylation was accompanied by a decrease in MKP expression, we analyzed by Western blotting the protein levels of the different MKPs known to be able to dephosphorylate Erk. Although the levels of MKP1, MKP2, hVH3, and MKP4 were not influenced by PDGF-BB stimulation (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B, for PDGFRα and PDGFRβ, respectively), MKP3 underwent rapid degradation in response to PDGF-BB stimulation in both PDGFRα- and PDGFRβ-expressing cells; after 1-2 h of PDGFRα stimulation, MKP3 levels returned to initial levels, followed by a second phase of degradation (Fig. 2A, upper panel). In contrast, activation of PDGFRβ induced a slower degradation of MKP3 and a minor wave of MKP3 protein expression, followed by a second phase of MKP3 decrease (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The biphasic activation of Erk downstream of PDGFRα was inversely correlated with biphasic kinetics of MKP3 protein expression (compare Figs. 1A and 2A). This suggests that PDGF-BB-induced changes in the intensity of Erk activity are related to the level of MKP3 protein. To further characterize the MKP3 degradation downstream of PDGFRα,we measured the protein stability in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide in the presence or absence of PDGF-BB; the half-life of MKP3 was estimated for both the first and second waves of degradation (Fig. 2B). We found the half-life for the first wave of degradation to be ∼20 min, compared with 25 min for the second wave. The high level of MKP3 expression after 1-2 h of PDGF-BB stimulation of PDGFRα may explain why the Erk phosphorylation is low despite significant Mek phosphorylation at these time points (compare Figs. 1, A and B, and 2A). Stimulation of PDGFRβ induced a more sustained Erk phosphorylation, which is compatible with the observation that after the initial MKP3 degradation, the protein level remained low with only a minor transient increase after 2 h of PDGF-BB stimulation (Fig. 2A, lower panel).FIGURE 2MKP3 protein levels are regulated by PDGF-BB in a Mek-dependent manner. A, kinetics of MKP3 protein levels after PDGF stimulation. B, analysis of PDGF-induced MKP3 degradation in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide.

Left panel, first wave of degradation; right panel, second wave of degradation. C, PDGF-induced MKP3 ubiquitination. D, the effect of proteasomal inhibition on PDGF-induced changes in MKP3 protein levels. E, the effect of Mek inhibition on MKP3 protein levels. Cells were serum-starved, preincubated with inhibitors before stimulation with PDGF-BB (100 ng/ml), as specified. Total cell lysates (TCL) were prepared, and the levels of MKP3 and MKP2 and activation of Erk were assayed by immunoblotting (Ib). For MKP3 ubiquitination, MKP3 was immunoprecipitated (Ip). β-Actin immunoblotting served as loading control. Quantifications shown in A and E are the averages of three independent experiments ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PDGF-BB-induced Erk Activation Requires Proteasomal Degradation of MKP3—To investigate whether the rapid degradation of MKP3 induced by PDGF-BB occurred through the proteasome, we analyzed the ability of PDGF-BB to induce ubiquitination of MKP3 and the effect of treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 on MKP3 stability. Fig. 2C shows that that MKP3 indeed becomes ubiquitinated in response to PDGF-BB stimulation. Furthermore, we found that MG132 treatment completely inhibited the degradation of MKP3 both in PDGFRα- and PDGFRβ-expressing cells (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, in the presence of proteasomal inhibitor, we observed that PDGF-BB was no longer able to induce a robust Erk activation (Fig. 2D). The blunted Erk phosphorylation may be attributed to stabilization of MKP3 and thus an increased dephosphorylation of Erk. It is possible that stabilization of other phosphatases also is involved. However, we were unable to detect any effects of MG132 on the levels of MKP1, MKP2, and hVH3 (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. 1, C and D), arguing for a relatively specific role of MKP3 in this process.In order to determine whether activation of the Erk pathway is important for the degradation of MKP3, we treated cells with the low molecular weight inhibitor U0126, which inhibits Mek and consequently Erk activation, and investigated the effect on PDGF-BB-induced MKP3 degradation. Treatment with U0126 resulted in a significant reduction in the rapid degradation of MKP3 after PDGF-BB stimulation, both in PDGFRα- and PDGFRβ-expressing cells (Fig. 2E; compare bands after 30 min of PDGF-BB stimulation in the absence or presence of U0126). Furthermore, we observed that the increased levels of MKP3 normally seen after 2 h of PDGF-BB stimulation did not occur in the presence of U0126, and in fact we found a decrease in MKP3 level (Fig. 2E). In Fig. 4B, we show that the mkp3 gene is activated by PDGF-BB in a manner requiring Erk activity. Thus, the decrease in MKP3 level after 2 h of PDGF-BB stimulation in the presence of U0126 may be caused by general protein turnover in combination with inhibited expression of the mkp3 gene. Another possibility is that U0126 has been partially metabolized, thereby allowing for weak PDGF-BB-induced MKP3 degradation in combination with partially inhibited mkp3 gene expression. Normally, MKP3 appears as multiple bands in immunoblotting. However, after U0126 treatment, the slowest migrating band disappeared, suggesting that it can represent a phosphorylated species of MKP3 (Fig. 2E). In support of this notion, PDGF-BB induced phosphorylation of MKP3 in a Mekdependent manner, as determined by metabolic [32P]orthophosphate labeling of cells treated with PDGF-BB in the absence or presence of U0126 as indicated (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 4mkp3 is induced by PDGF-BB in an Erk-dependent manner. PAE/PDGFRα and PAE/PDGFRβ cells were serum-starved and then stimulated with PDGF-BB (100 ng/ml) for the indicated time intervals (A) with or without pretreatment with U0126 inhibitor (10 μm) for 1 h (B). Total RNA isolated from the cells was subjected to reverse transcription with oligo(dT) primers and analyzed by real time PCR with primers specific to mkp3. The mkp3 expression was normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and quantified relative to time 0. Shown are mean ± S.D. for three replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Identification of Ser174 and Ser300 as PDGF-induced phosphorylation sites and their role in MKP3 stability. A, PAE/PDGFRα cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, treated with U0126 as indicated, and stimulated with PDGF-BB followed by lysis and MKP3 immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose filter, and visualization by autoradiography. The band corresponding to MKP3 was excised and digested in situ with trypsin. B, the resulting digests were separated on TLC plates at pH 1.9, followed by ascending chromatography. Radioactive peptides were detected by autoradiography. C, phosphopeptides 1 and 2 were eluted and subjected to Edman degradation using a gas phase sequencer as well as to phosphoamino acid analysis. The release of radioactivity in each cycle is indicated. The amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides derived from MKP3 containing a serine residue at position where radioactivity was released are presented. D, to analyze the effect of mutating Ser-159, Ser-174, Ser-197, and Ser-300 to alanine residues on MKP3 stability, 293T cells were transfected with these mutant forms of MKP3 together with PDGFRα. After 30 min of PDGF-BB stimulation, total cell lysates were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to MKP3 immunoblotting. All mutations were expressed in combination with C293A rendering MKP3 phosphatase inactive, thereby allowing overexpressed protein to be phosphorylated. E, the effect on the mutation of Ser-174 to alanine was investigated during extended PDGF-BB stimulation in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. Quantifications shown are the averages of three independent experiments ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the phosphorylation sites in MKP3 following PDGF-BB stimulation, we performed two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of the tryptic MKP3 digest (Fig. 3B). Two phosphopeptides (denoted peptide 1 and peptide 2) were recovered and subjected to Edman degradation and phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 3C). Matching the cycle in which radioactivity was released during Edman degradation and the result from the phosphoamino acid analysis with the sequences of all tryptic fragments of MKP3 revealed Ser-174 and Ser-300 as novel PDGF-induced phosphorylation sites in MKP3. In the case of Ser-174 (peptide 1), only one MKP3-derived tryptic peptide was consistent with the cycle where radioactivity was released, whereas both Ser-300 and Ser-328 could match the pattern obtained for peptide 2. However, through mutational analysis we could exclude Ser-328 (data not shown). To elucidate whether the PDGF-induced phosphorylation was important for MKP3 stability, we mutated Ser-174 and Ser-300 to Ala (denoted S174A and S300A) and investigated the impact on MKP3 stability. In addition, also the previously identified serum-induced MKP3 phosphorylation sites Ser-159 and Ser-197 (19Marchetti S. Gimond C. Chambard J.C. Touboul T. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were mutated to Ala, denoted S159A and S197A; these sites may represent serum-specific phosphorylation sites in MKP3, since these were not identified as phosphorylated in our model system in response to PDGF-BB stimulation. To be able to express these MKP3 mutants in transient transfection experiments using 293T cells without abolishing Erk phosphorylation, we also had to mutate the active site Cys-293 to Ala (C293A). As can be seen in Fig. 3D, mutation of Ser-174 caused a marked stabilization of MKP3, suggesting an important role of this phosphorylation site in the regulation of M"
https://openalex.org/W2053240723,"LP2086 is a family of outer membrane lipoproteins from Neisseria meningitidis, which elicits bactericidal antibodies and are currently undergoing human clinical trials in a bivalent formulation where each antigen represents one of the two known LP2086 subfamilies. Here we report the NMR structure of the recombinant LP2086 variant B01, a representative of the LP2086 subfamily B. The structure reveals a novel fold composed of two domains: a ""taco-shaped"" N-terminal beta-sheet and a C-terminal beta-barrel connected by a linker. The structure in micellar solution is consistent with a model of LP2086 anchored to the outer membrane bilayer through its lipidated N terminus. A long flexible chain connects the folded part of the protein to the lipid anchor and acts as spacer, making both domains accessible to the host immune system. Antibodies broadly reactive against members from both subfamilies have been mapped to the N terminus. A surface of subfamily-defining residues was identified on one face of the protein, offering an explanation for the induction of subfamily-specific bactericidal antibodies."

Yap1, the master transcription factor for the oxidative stress response in budding yeast, is activated by the formation of disulfide bonds in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Gpx3 (glutathione peroxidase-like protein 3) acts as a receptor for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and Ybp1 (Yap1-binding protein 1) is crucial for Gpx3-dependent disulfide bond formation in Yap1. We previously reported that Tsa1, a major peroxiredoxin in yeast cells, is required for activation of Yap1 in a widely used yeast strain, W303-1b, carrying the <i>ybp1</i>-<i>1</i> mutant allele encoding a truncated Ybp1 protein. In the present study, we show that Tsa1 can interact with Yap1 via disulfide linkages and induce the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds in Yap1 in <i>ybp1</i>-<i>1</i> cells. The results provide evidence that Prx can have intrinsic activity as an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> receptor and can relay H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as a signal to the Prx target proteins in terms of formation of disulfide linkage. Furthermore, our data reveal that there is more of the reduction-resistant active form of Yap1 (<i>i.e.</i> Yap1 (oxII)) when it is partnered with Gpx3 than with Tsa1. These data support our hypothesis that changes in the redox status of Yap1 to reduction-resistant forms by multiple disulfide bond formation are important for determining the level and duration of Yap1 activity in the dynamic equilibrium of redox reactions in cells exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>."
https://openalex.org/W2049298424,"Two thioesterases are commonly found in natural product biosynthetic clusters, a type I thioesterase that is responsible for removing the final product from the biosynthetic complex and a type II thioesterase that is believed to perform housekeeping functions such as removing aberrant units from carrier domains. We present the crystal structure and the kinetic analysis of RifR, a type II thioesterase from the hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetases/polyketide synthase rifamycin biosynthetic cluster of Amycolatopsis mediterranei. Steady-state kinetics show that RifR has a preference for the hydrolysis of acyl units from the phosphopantetheinyl arm of the acyl carrier domain over the hydrolysis of acyl units from the phosphopantetheinyl arm of acyl-CoAs as well as a modest preference for the decarboxylated substrate mimics acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA over malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA. Multiple RifR conformations and structural similarities to other thioesterases suggest that movement of a helical lid controls access of substrates to the active site of RifR."
https://openalex.org/W2042239273,"Alternative splice variants of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) IIIb, designated C1, C2, and C3, possess progressive reduction in their cytoplasmic carboxyl termini (822, 788, and 769 residues, respectively), with preferential expression of the C2 and C3 isoforms in human cancers. We determined that the progressive deletion of carboxyl-terminal sequences correlated with increasing transforming potency. The highly transforming C3 variant lacks five tyrosine residues present in C1, and we determined that the loss of Tyr-770 alone enhanced FGFR2 IIIb C1 transforming activity. Because Tyr-770 may compose a putative YXXL sorting motif, we hypothesized that loss of Tyr-770 in the 770YXXL motif may cause disruption of FGFR2 IIIb C1 internalization and enhance transforming activity. Surprisingly, we found that mutation of Leu-773 but not Tyr-770 impaired receptor internalization and increased receptor stability and activation. Interestingly, concurrent mutations of Tyr-770 and Leu-773 caused 2-fold higher transforming activity than caused by the Y770F or L773A single mutations, suggesting loss of Tyr and Leu residues of the 770YXXL773 motif enhances FGFR2 IIIb transforming activity by distinct mechanisms. We also determined that loss of Tyr-770 caused persistent activation of FRS2 by enhancing FRS2 binding to FGFR2 IIIb. Furthermore, we found that FRS2 binding to FGFR2 IIIb is required for increased FRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced transforming activity by Y770F mutation. Our data support a dual mechanism where deletion of the 770YXXL773 motif promotes FGFR2 IIIb C3 transforming activity by causing aberrant receptor recycling and stability and persistent FRS2-dependent signaling.

Furthermore, we found that FRS2 binding to FGFR2 IIIb is required for increased FRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced transforming activity by Y770F mutation. Our data support a dual mechanism where deletion of the 770YXXL773 motif promotes FGFR2 IIIb C3 transforming activity by causing aberrant receptor recycling and stability and persistent FRS2-dependent signaling. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 2The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; KGF, keratinocyte growth factor; PLCγ, phospholipase C gamma; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FRS2, FGF receptor substrate 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PI, phosphatidylinositol; WT, wild type; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase. compose a large family of structurally related growth factors (22 human members) that mediate cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and angiogenesis (1Dailey L. Ambrosetti D. Mansukhani A. Basilico C. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 2Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The activities of FGFs are mediated by their binding to a family of four receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), designated FGFR1–4 (5Itoh N. Ornitz D.M. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 563-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). FGFRs are composed of an extracellular domain that consists of two or three Ig-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular catalytic tyrosine kinase domain and flanking regulatory sequences (Fig. 1A). An important feature and mode of regulation of FGFR2 function is that structural variants of FGFR2 are generated by numerous alternative gene splicing events that generate transcripts that encode proteins altered in both the extracellular and intracellular regions of the FGFR2 (5Itoh N. Ornitz D.M. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 563-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). To date, more than 20 alternative splicing variants of FGFR2 have been identified. The first major splicing event occurs in the second half of the third Ig-like domain (designated Ig-III domain). Tissue-specific inclusion of either exon IIIb or exon IIIc that encodes for the second half of the Ig-III domain generates either the epithelial cell-specific IIIb or mesenchymal cell-specific IIIc isoforms (6Orr-Urtreger A. Bedford M.T. Burakova T. Arman E. Zimmer Y. Yayon A. Givol D. Lonai P. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). This alternative splicing determines the ligand binding specificity of FGFR2. Although FGFR2 IIIb (also called KGFR) binds FGF7 (also called KGF) and FGF10, but not FGF2, FGFR2 IIIc (also called BEK) binds FGF2, but not FGF7 and FGF10 (7Dell K.R. Williams L.T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 158: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), expression of the ligands for FGFR2 IIIb (FGF7 and FGF10) is restricted to mesenchymal cells (11Finch P.W. Rubin J.S. Miki T.

Dev. 1994; 45: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), resulting in the creation of a paracrine signaling loop in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that is likely to be critically for promoting FGFR2 IIIb activity in oncogenesis. The second major splicing occurs in sequences that encode the carboxyl terminus of FGFR2. Three splice variants of FGFR2 IIIb that differ in their carboxyl-terminal sequences have been identified (designated C1, C2, and C3) (17Itoh H. Hattori Y. Sakamoto H. Ishii H. Kishi T. Sasaki H. Yoshida T. Koono M. Sugimura T. Terada M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3237-3241PubMed Google Scholar). The C2-type carboxyl terminus is 34 amino acids shorter than the C1-type carboxyl terminus, and the C3-type carboxyl terminus is 19 amino acids shorter than C2-type carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1A). These sequence differences result in differential retention of tyrosine residues that may serve as sites of receptor autophosphorylation and docking sites for cytoplasmic signaling proteins. A previous study found that expression of the C3 isoform was increased in gastric cancer cell lines (17Itoh H. Hattori Y. Sakamoto H. Ishii H. Kishi T. Sasaki H. Yoshida T. Koono M. Sugimura T. Terada M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3237-3241PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed enhanced expression of C2 and C3 isoforms in a majority of human breast carcinoma cell lines when compared with nontransformed MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells (18Cha J.Y. Lambert Q.T. Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that aberrant expression of the C2 or C3 splicing variants may contribute to cancer development. Furthermore, the C3 variant that lacks carboxyl-terminal sequences was shown to be more transforming than the IIIb C1 variant when expressed ectopically in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and human mammary epithelial cells (17Itoh H. Hattori Y. Sakamoto H. Ishii H. Kishi T. Sasaki H. Yoshida T. Koono M. Sugimura T. Terada M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3237-3241PubMed Google Scholar, 19Moffa A.B. Tannheimer S.L. Ethier S.P. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 643-652PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether the C2 variant is more (or less) transforming than the C1 (or C3) variant has not been determined. Furthermore, the mechanistic basis for the enhanced transforming activity of the C3 variant remains to be elucidated. Like other RTKs, FGFRs are activated by ligand-induced dimerization, causing stimulation of their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, tyrosine autophosphorylation, and recruitment of signaling proteins to specific phosphorylated tyrosine residues in their cytoplasmic carboxyl termini. The two best characterized downstream signaling components of FGFRs are phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) and FGF receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) (1Dailey L. Ambrosetti D. Mansukhani A. Basilico C. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 2Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In FGFR1, Tyr-766 in the carboxyl terminus is the major autophosphorylation site on FGFR1 and serves as a binding site for the Src homology 2 domain of PLCγ, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ (20Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 21Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis and the generation of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (22Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). The Tyr-766 residue in FGFR1 is well conserved in all four FGFR family members and corresponds to Tyr-770 in FGFR2 IIIb (Fig. 1B). Recently, it was shown that a Y770F missense mutant of FGFR2 IIIb C1 cannot bind and phosphorylate PLCγ (23Ceridono M. Belleudi F. Ceccarelli S. Torrisi M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 327: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, whether this mutant fails to activate PI hydrolysis and whether altered PLCγ binding and activation contribute to FGFR2 transforming activity remain unresolved. Unlike PLCγ, FRS2 association with FGFR is constitutive and independent of ligand stimulation and receptor phosphorylation (24Ong S.H. Guy G.R. Hadari Y.R. Laks S. Gotoh N. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). FRS2 is a docking protein that binds to a conserved sequence within the juxtamembrane domain of FGFRs. Ligand-stimulated activation of FGFRs leads to phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in FRS2 (25Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). One well characterized FRS2 effector is the Grb2 adaptor protein that binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 and forms a stable complex with the Sos Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, thus stimulating activation of the Ras small GTPase and the ERK MAPK cascade (25Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). In addition, Grb2 can recruit the docking protein Gab1, which is then tyrosine-phosphorylated by FGFR2 activation. The tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 recruits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), resulting in activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase (26Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). One mechanism of negative regulation of RTK signaling involves ligand-mediated receptor internalization and lysosomal degradation (27Bache K.G. Slagsvold T. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2707-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 28Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Therefore, disruption of receptor internalization could lead to aberrant receptor activation and contribute to the development of human disease, including cancer. Interestingly, FGFR2 IIIb C1 contains a putative YXXΦ tyrosine-based sorting motif (where X is any amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) (29Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar) in carboxyl-terminal sequences deleted in the C3 variant, suggesting that the loss of the YXXΦ motif might impair receptor internalization and contribute to the enhanced transforming activity of the FGFR2 IIIb C3 variant. To date, a detailed comparative analysis of the transforming potential of FGFR2 IIIb C1, C2, and C3 using the same cell system has not been done. In this study, we compared the transforming potency of FGFR2 IIIb C1, C2, and C3 splicing variants and found that the C3 variant is considerably more transforming than the C2 variant, and the C2 variant is modestly enhanced in transforming activity when compared with the weakly transforming C1 variant. Our results support a model where the potent transforming activity of the FGFR2 IIIb C3 splice variant is mediated, in part, by a mechanism involving loss of the 770YLDL motif, resulting in impaired receptor internalization and enhanced FRS2-dependent signaling. Plasmid Expression Vectors-Human FGFR2 IIIb C1, C2, and C3 cDNA sequences were generated by PCR amplification from a T-47D breast cancer cell cDNA library and subcloned into the pBabe-puro retrovirus mammalian expression vector (5′-SalI and 3′-BamHI sites). The FGFR2 IIIb C2 (QST) cDNA sequence (deletion of FGFR2 IIIb C1 residues 789–822) was created by PCR amplification from the FGFR2 IIIb C1 cDNA sequence and subcloned into pBabe-puro (5′-SalI and 3′-BamHI sites). Additional cDNA sequences encoding missense mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Oligonucleotides designed to create the appropriate mutations to encode the indicated amino acid substitutions are as follows: 5′-CACAACCAATGAGGAATTCTTGGACCTCAGCCAACC-3′ (Y770F); 5′-GCCAACCTCTCGAACAGTTTTCACCTAGTTACCCTG-3′ (Y780F); 5′-CAGTATTCACCTAGTTTCCCTGACACAAGAAG-3′ (Y784F); 5′-CCAGACCCCATGCCTTTCGAACCATGCCTTCCT-3′ (Y806F); 5′-CATGCCTTCCTCAGTTTCCACACATAAACGGC-3′ (Y813F); 5′-GAGGAATTCTTGGACGCCAGCCAACCTCTCGAACAG-3′ (Y770F/L773A); 5′-CCAATGAGGAAGCCTTGGACGCCAGCCAACCTCTCG-3′ (Y770A/L773A); 5′-GAGGAATACTTGGACGCCAGCCAACCTCTCG-3′ (L773A); and 5′-GCACAAGCTGACCGCACGTATCGCCGCGCGGAGACAGG-3′ (K421A/P424A/L425A). Cell Culture and Transformation Assay-Rat-1 and RIE-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For secondary focus formation assays, Rat-1 and RIE-1 cells were stably infected with pBabe-puro constructs encoding wild type FGFR2 IIIb isoforms and missense mutants of FGFR2 IIIb C1. Expression of ectopically introduced FGFR2 IIIb C1 proteins was determined by immunoblot analyses with anti-FGFR2 antibody (sc-122; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After infection, cells were selected in growth medium supplemented with puromycin (2 μg/ml). Drug-resistant colonies were pooled and replated into 60-mm dishes and maintained in growth medium for 2–3 weeks. Cells were then fixed and stained with crystal violet. To determine anchorage-independent growth potential, Rat-1 cells stably expressing either the pBabe-puro empty vector or encoding various FGFR2 IIIb proteins were suspended in 0.4% bacto-agar in growth medium at 5 × 104 cells per 60-mm dish. After 2–3 weeks, colonies were stained with 2 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, and the average number of colonies on duplicate dishes was calculated. For conditioned medium assays, Rat-1 fibroblast conditioned medium was collected and passaged through a 0.45-μm filter. RIE-1 cells stably infected with the pBabe-puro empty vector, or encoding WT or Y770F mutant FGFR2 IIIb C1, were grown either in conditioned medium or regular growth medium, replenished every 2 days, for 3 weeks before cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Immunofluorescence Microscopy-Rat-1 cells that stably express either wild type or mutant FGFR2 IIIb proteins were serum-starved for 20 h and then incubated with either vehicle (bovine serum albumin (BSA)) or 50 ng/ml FGF7 (R & D Systems) for 40 min at 37 °C to allow internalization. Cells were then fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed, and permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100). Next, cells were immunostained with rabbit polyclonal FGFR2 antibody (sc-122; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to determine FGFR2 IIIb subcellular location by Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope. Cleavable Biotin Internalization Assay-Internalization of FGFR2 IIIb was quantitatively measured as described previously (30Fabbri M. Fumagalli L. Bossi G. Bianchi E. Bender J.R. Pardi R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4915-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Rat-1 cells that stably express either wild type or mutant FGFR2 IIIb proteins were serum-starved for 20 h. The cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Ca2+/Mg2+ PBS). For surface biotinylation, cells were incubated with thiolcleavable sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin (0.5 mg/ml; Pierce) for 1 h on ice. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+ PBS and stimulated with FGF7 at 37 °C for the indicated times to allow internalization. Cells were then put back on ice and washed three times with ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+ PBS. To remove the residual surface biotin, cells were washed three times, for 15 min each, with ice-cold glutathione (GSH; membrane-nonpermeable reducing agent) cleavage solution (50 mm glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% BSA, and 0.75% 10 n NaOH). Cells were further washed twice on ice with Ca2+/Mg2+ PBS and incubated for 15 min with 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide (in Ca2+/Mg2+ PBS with 1% BSA; quenching buffer) to quench free sulfo-reactive groups. Cells were then washed five times, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with Neutravidin beads (Pierce) followed by immunoblotting with FGFR2 antibody. Immunoblot band intensity was quantified by ImageJ analysis (National Institutes of Health). Receptor Down-regulation Assays-Rat-1 cells that stably express either wild type or mutant FGFR2 IIIb proteins were incubated with 50 ng/ml FGF7 for the indicated times at 37 °C to induce ligand-induced receptor degradation. Immunoblotting analyses with FGFR2 antibody were performed to determine the level of remaining FGFR2 protein. Band intensity was quantified by ImageJ analysis. Signaling Analyses-To determine FGFR2 tyrosine autophosphorylation, cells were lysed and analyzed for tyrosine-phosphorylated FGFR2 by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FGFR2 antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (05-321, clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). To determine PLCγ activation, cells were lysed and then analyzed for tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ by immunoprecipitation with anti-PLCγ antibody (sc-7290, clone E-12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. PI hydrolysis assays were performed to measure PLCγ activity as we have described previously (31Brown H.A. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Rat-1 cells stably expressing either wild type FGFR2 IIIb C1 or 770F mutant were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol in inositol-free medium. Then cells were stimulated with FGF7, vehicle (BSA, negative control), thrombin (positive control), or lysophosphatidic acid (positive control) for 20 min in medium supplemented with 10 mm LiCl. Accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates was quantitated as described previously (31Brown H.A. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar). To determine FRS2 activation, cells were lysed and then analyzed for tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 by immunoprecipitation with anti-FRS2 antibody (sc-8318; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. To determine Gab1 activation, cells were lysed and analyzed for tyrosine-phosphorylated Gab1 by immunoprecipitation with anti-Gab1 antibody (sc-9049; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. To determine MEK, ERK, or AKT activation, cells were lysed and then analyzed for active MEK, ERK, or AKT by immunoblot analyses with antibody specifically to detect phosphorylated MEK1/2 (9121; Cell Signaling Technology), ERK (9106; Cell Signaling Technology), or AKT (9271; Cell Signaling Technology). Total ERK and AKT levels were determined by anti-ERK (9102; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-AKT antibodies (9272; Cell Signaling Technology), respectively. To determine FRS2 binding to FGFR2, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FRS2 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-FGFR2 antibody. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed with the anti-FRS2 antibody to determine the protein levels of endogenous FRS2. Loss of Carboxyl-terminal Sequences Enhances FGFR2 IIIb Transforming Potency in Rat-1 Fibroblasts and RIE-1 Epithelial Cells-To determine the role of carboxyl-terminal sequences in FGFR2 IIIb transformation, we compared the transforming potency of FGFR2 IIIb C1, C2, and C3 variants by examining two aspects of growth transformation, loss of density-dependent growth inhibition, and acquisition of anchorage-independent growth potential. For these analyses, we established Rat-1 rat fibroblasts and RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells stably expressing the FGFR2 IIIb C1, C2, or C3 variants. First, we compared the ability of the three FGFR2 IIIb variants to induce loss of density-dependent growth inhibition by quantitating the appearance of foci of multilayered cells in confluent cultures. Cells stably transfected with the empty vector or expressing the C1 variant exhibited no focus forming activity. In contrast, we found that cells expressing the C2 variant exhibited weak focus forming activity, whereas the C3 variant caused significantly greater focus forming activity than the C2 variant in RIE-1 (Fig. 1C) as well as Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1E). Second, we compared the ability of three FGFR2 IIIb variants to promote anchorage-independent growth by soft agar assay. Consistent with their relative focus-forming potencies, the C3 variant induced more soft agar colonies than the C2 variant, and the C2 variant induced more soft agar colonies than the C1 variant in RIE-1 (Fig. 1D) as well as Rat-1 cells (Fig. 1F). A similar hierarchy of transforming potency, as measured by soft agar colony formation, was seen when the FGFR2 IIIb isoforms were stably expressed in MCF-10 human breast epithelial cells (data not shown). These data indicate that multiple carboxyl-terminal sequences function as negative regulators of FGFR2 IIIb transforming activity, with the loss of residues within the region spanning 769–788 causing the most significant activation of transforming activity. Mutation of Y770F Alone Activates FGFR2 IIIb C1 Transforming Activity in Rat-1 Fibroblasts-Next, we determined the critical residue losses that contribute to the enhanced transforming activity of FGFR2 IIIb variants lacking carboxyl-terminal sequences. The carboxyl-terminal domain tyrosine residues of RTKs are sites of autophosphorylation and critical for their cytoplasmic signaling and growth regulatory activities. The C3 variant lacks five tyrosine residues (Tyr-770, Tyr-780, Tyr-784, Tyr-806, and Tyr-813), whereas the C2 variant lacks two tyrosine residues (Tyr-806 and Tyr-813) present in the C1 isoform (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that the loss of specific tyrosine residue(s) might account for the enhanced transforming activity of the C2 and (or) C3 variants. To address this possibility, we introduced phenylalanine substitutions at each of the five tyrosine residues (Y770F, Y780F, Y784F, Y806F, and Y813F) of the carboxyl terminus of the weakly transforming C1 variant. Because loss of multiple tyrosine residues might be required for enhanced transforming activity, we also generated double (F2, Y806F/Y813F), triple (F3, Y784F/Y806F/Y813F), quadruple (F4, Y770F/Y784F/Y806F/Y813F), and quintuple (F5, Y770F/Y780F/Y784F/Y806F/Y813F) mutants. We then established mass populations of Rat-1 cells that stably expressed wild type and mutant FGFR2 IIIb C1 proteins and compared their transforming potency in soft agar assays. We found that the Y770F mutation alone promoted colony formation in soft agar (∼600 colonies per dish), whereas receptors with the Y780F, Y784F, Y806F, or Y813F mutations showed the same weak colony forming activity (∼200 colonies per dish) as cells expressing the WT FGFR2 IIIb C1 receptor (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, we found that the F2 double or F3 triple mutant receptors showed the same transforming potency as WT FGFR2 IIIb C1 (Fig. 2B), whereas the F4 quadruple and F5 quintuple mutants that included the Y770F mutation promoted colony formation in soft agar to the same extent as the Y770F single mutant (Fig. 2B). We found that all FGFR2 IIIb C1 mutants were expressed at a similar level as WT FGFR2 IIIb C1 (Fig. 2C), indicating that the differences in transforming activity were not because of differences in steady-state levels of protein expression. Because the anti-FGFR2 antibody recognizes a carboxyl-terminal epitope that is deleted in C2 and C3, we could not exclude the possibility that different transforming potency of the C2 and C3 mutants may be due, in part, to different levels of expression. As an indirect evaluation of receptor expression, we did find that FGF7 stimulation of the cells expressing the C1, C2, and C3 variants showed comparable levels of phosphorylated FRS2 (Fig. 7A), suggesting that the three isoforms were expressed at comparable levels. Together, these results indicate that loss of the Tyr-770 residue, but not other tyrosine residues (Tyr-780, Tyr-784, Tyr-806, and Tyr-813), contributes to the increased transforming potency of the C3 variant. However, because the C2 variant retains Tyr-770 (Fig. 1A), the loss of this residue is not the basis for the increased transforming activity of the C2 variant. It is notable that the C2 variant lacks 34 carboxyl-terminal residues found in the C1 variant, but additionally, it is also divergent from the C1 variant for three amino acids at positions 779, 783, and 787 (Fig. 1A). Although C1 contains 779Q/783S/787T, C2 contains 779P/783C/787P. Therefore, we speculated that differences in these three amino acids might contribute to the increased transforming potency of the C2 variant. To address this possibility, we generated a truncation mutant of C1 that has same length as C2 but contains the 779Q/783S/787T sequence (designated C2 (QST)) rather than the 779P/783C/787P sequence. We found that this C2 (QST) mutant exhibited a similar transforming potency as the C2 variant (Fig. 2B), indicating that the loss of the carboxyl-terminal 34 amino acids (from 789 residue to 822 residue), and not differences in 779, 783, and 787 residues, is responsible for increased transforming potency of the C2 variant.

Here, we show that caveolin-1 activates ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) after oxidative stress by sequestering the ATM inhibitor, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, into caveolar membranes. We demonstrate that cigarette smoke extracts promote stress-induced premature senescence in wild type but not caveolin-1 null lung fibroblasts and that caveolin-1 expression is required for activation of the ATM-p53-p21Waf1/Cip1 pathway following stimulation with cigarette smoke extracts in vitro. In vivo studies show that caveolin-1 expression is necessary for cigarette smoking-induced senescence of lung fibroblasts and pulmonary emphysema. These findings bring new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying free radical activation of the ATM-p53 pathway and indicate that caveolin-1 is a novel therapeutic target for the treatment and/or prevention of pulmonary emphysema."
https://openalex.org/W2007487938,"RhoA is transiently activated by specific extracellular signals such as endothelin-1 (ET-1) in vascular smooth muscle cells. RhoGAP negatively regulates RhoA activity: thus, RhoA becomes the GDP-bound inactive form afterward. Sustained activation of RhoA is induced with high doses of the extracellular signals and is implicated in certain diseases such as vasospasms. However, it remains largely unknown how prolonged activation of RhoA is induced. Here we show that Rho-kinase, an effector of RhoA, phosphorylated p190A RhoGAP at Ser1150 and attenuated p190A RhoGAP activity in COS7 cells. Binding of Rnd to p190A RhoGAP is thought to enhance its activation. Phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP by Rho-kinase impaired Rnd binding. Stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells with a high dose of ET-1 provoked sustained RhoA activation and p190A RhoGAP phosphorylation, both of which were prohibited by a Rho-kinase inhibitor. The phosphomimic mutation of p190A RhoGAP weakened Rnd binding and RhoGAP activities. Taken together, these results suggest that ET-1 induces Rho-kinase activation and subsequent phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP, leading to prolonged RhoA activation.

Taken together, these results suggest that ET-1 induces Rho-kinase activation and subsequent phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP, leading to prolonged RhoA activation. RhoA small GTPase is the molecular switch for various extracellular signals and is implicated in a variety of biological functions, including cell contraction, cell migration, cell adhesion, cell cycle progression, and gene expression (1Burridge K.

Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). We previously found that Rho-kinase phosphorylates myosin phosphatase target protein 1 (MYPT1) 3The abbreviations used are: MYPT1, myosin phosphatase target protein-1; ET-1, endothelin-1; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; FL, full length; RBD, Rho-binding domain; WT, wild-type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid(s); HA, hemagglutinin; Ab, antibody. of myosin phosphatase and thereby inactivates its phosphatase activity, resulting in an increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain followed by smooth muscle contraction (3Hartshorne D.J.

Rho-kinase increases the agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitivity and contributes to sustained contraction of smooth muscle (6Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1325-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). RhoA cycles between the GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive conformations. This cycle is under the direct control of three groups of regulatory proteins: the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP to activate RhoA; GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA to promote hydrolysis of GTP to GDP to inactivate RhoA; and the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, which sequester the GDP-bound RhoA and may also regulate its intracellular localization (1Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 2Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 247-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). The typical RhoGEFs contain a catalytic Dbl homology domain and an adjacent pleckstrin homology domain. This Dbl homology-associated pleckstrin homology domain interacts with phospholipids, which may localize GEFs to the plasma membrane and activate GEF activity (7Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 8Rossman K.L. Cheng L. Mahon G.M. Rojas R.J. Snyder J.T. Whitehead I.P. Sondek J. J. Biol.

Three RhoGEFs, which contain the regulator of G protein-signaling domains, including leukemia-associated RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and p115RhoGEF, directly link between Gα12/Gα13 and RhoA (9Kozasa T.

A. 2003; 100: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Gα12 and Gα13 specifically interact with the regulator of G protein-signaling domains of these RhoGEFs and positively regulate their GEF activity (12Sternweis P.C. Carter A.M. Chen Z. Danesh S.M. Hsiung Y.F. Singer W.D. Adv. Protein Chem. 2007; 74: 189-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The typical RhoGAPs have a catalytic domain and various domains for protein-protein interaction. Recent studies suggest that RhoGAPs are regulated by various mechanisms, including protein-protein interaction, phospholipid interaction, phosphorylation, subcellular translocation, and proteolytic degradation (13Bernards A. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Tcherkezian J. Lamarche-Vane N. Biol. Cell. 2007; 99: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms that regulate RhoGAP activity remain elusive in many cases. When the smooth muscle cells are stimulated with agonists such as ET-1, RhoA is transiently activated presumably through RhoA-specific GEFs such as leukemia-associated RhoGEF and inactivated later (11Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Mano H. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 15Sakurada S. Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. Takuwa Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. 2001; 281: C571-C578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RhoA-specific GAP appears to be responsible for RhoA inactivation under physiological conditions (16Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2711-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Sustained RhoA/Rho-kinase activation occurs with high doses of ET-1 (17Woodsome T.P. Polzin A. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1769-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Prolonged activation of RhoA/Rho-kinase is implicated in the pathogenesis of certain vascular diseases, including subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced cerebral vasospasm, coronary vasospasm, essential hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension (18Loirand G. Guerin P. Pacaud P. Circulation Res. 2006; 98: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 19Wettschureck N. Offermanns S. J. Mol. Med. (Berlin). 2002; 80: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). For example, RhoA activity is higher in aortic smooth muscle cells derived from the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat than from the wild-type rat, although the expression levels of RhoA are not different between mutant and wild-type rats (20Moriki N. Ito M. Seko T. Kureishi Y. Okamoto R. Nakakuki T. Kongo M. Isaka N. Kaibuchi K. Nakano T. Hypertens. Res. 2004; 27: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Rho-kinase activity is up-regulated, and phosphorylation levels of MYPT1 are increased in the coronary spastic lesion in a porcine swine model (21Kandabashi T. Shimokawa H. Miyata K. Kunihiro I. Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Higo T. Egashira K. Takahashi S. Kaibuchi K. Takeshita A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1319-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Subarachnoid hemorrhage induces sustained Rho-kinase activation in the canine basilar artery and subsequent cerebral vasospasm (22Sato M. Tani E. Fujikawa H. Kaibuchi K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats is associated with an increase of RhoA activity in pulmonary artery (23Guilluy C. Sauzeau V. Rolli-Derkinderen M. Guerin P. Sagan C. Pacaud P. Loirand G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 146: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, it remains largely unknown how prolonged activation of RhoA is induced. In light of these observations, we hypothesized that highly activated RhoA/Rho-kinase can inhibit Rho-specific GAP and lead to sustained RhoA activation. Here we show that Rho-kinase phosphorylated p190A RhoGAP, the best characterized RhoA-specific GAP, at Ser1150 in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP by Rho-kinase appeared to attenuate its GAP activity. Materials and Chemicals—The cDNA-encoding human p190A RhoGAP (KIAA1722, p190A) was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Polyclonal anti-GFP antibody was from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). Monoclonal anti-p190A RhoGAP antibodies were from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) was from Boehringer (Ingelheim, Germany). Polyclonal anti-MYPT1-pT853 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-total MYPT1 antibody was generated as previously described (24Kimura K. Fukata Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5542-5548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against p190A RhoGAP phosphorylated at Ser1150 was produced against the phosphopeptide Cys-Arg1145-Gly-Arg-Lys-Val-phospho-Ser1150-Ile-Val-Ser-Lys-Pro1155 by Biologica Co. (Nagoya, Japan). Y-27632, a Rho-kinase-specific inhibitor, was provided by Mitsubishi Pharma Co. (Osaka, Japan). ET-1, BQ-123, and BQ-788 were from Sigma. Other materials and chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. Plasmid Constructs and Protein Purification—p190A RhoGAP fragments were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-2T (GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) or pEGFP-C1 (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) plasmids, respectively. The cDNAs of p190A RhoGAP-4-S1150A, p190A RhoGAP-4-S1150A/T1173A/S1174A (p190A RhoGAP-4-AAA), p190A RhoGAP-4-S1150E/T1173E/S1174E (p190A RhoGAP-4-EEE), p190A RhoGAP-5-T1226A/S1236A (p190A RhoGAP-5-AA), p190A RhoGAP-5-T1226A/T1241A, p190A RhoGAP-full-length-S1150A (p190A RhoGAP-FL-S1150A), and p190A RhoGAP-FL-S1150E/T1173E/S1174E/T1226E/S1236E (p190A RhoGAP-FL-5E), in which Ala or Glu was substituted for Ser1150, Thr1173, Ser1174, Thr1226, Ser1236, and/or Thr1241 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Rnd1 was isolated by PCR from a cDNA library and subcloned into pEF-BOS-HA plasmid. All fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). GST-Rho-kinase-CAT (aa 6–553), a constitutively active form of Rho-kinase, and GST-p190A RhoGAP-4 + 5 (aa 953–1499) were produced in Sf9 cells with a baculovirus system and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Phosphorylation Assay—The phosphorylation assay was performed as previously described (25Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). In brief, the kinase reaction of Rho-kinase for p190A RhoGAP was carried out in 50 μl of the reaction mixture (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1–20 GBq/mmol), purified GST-Rho-kinase-CAT (0.001–0.1 μm), and 1 μm purified GST-p190A RhoGAP fragments. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The radiolabeled bands were visualized and estimated by an image analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). GAP Assay—The RhoA GAP assay was performed as previously described (26Ligeti E. Settleman J. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant GST-RhoA was preloaded with 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP (222 TBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 25 μl of buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 10 min at 30 °C before the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm. An aliquot of [γ-32P]GTP-loaded GST-RhoA was mixed with the GAP assay buffer, which contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm GTP, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of nonphosphorylated GST-p190A RhoGAP-4 + 5 or phosphorylated GST-p190A RhoGAP-4 + 5. The reaction was performed for 5 min at 30 °C and terminated by rapid addition of 5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. The samples were then immediately deposited onto nitrocellulose filters. The radioactivity retained on the filter was then subjected to quantitative analysis by scintillation counting. RhoGAP activity was detected as the remainder of [γ-32P]GTP bound to GST-RhoA. GTP-Rho Pulldown Assay—The activity of RhoA was determined by pulldown assay with the GST-Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-Rhotekin-RBD) as previously described (27Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 20 μg of GST-Rhotekin-RBD. The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with an excess of lysis buffer and then eluted with SDS-sample buffer. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP antibody or anti-RhoA antibody. Rnd1-binding Assay—COS7 cells were transiently transfected with pEF-BOS-HA-Rnd1. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 μm Calyculin A, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads coated with 200 or 400 pmol of GST, 100 or 200 pmol of phosphorylated GST-p190A RhoGAP-4, and 100 or 200 pmol of nonphosphorylated GST-p190A RhoGAP-4 for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and the eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-HA antibody. Cell Culture and Agonist Stimulation—Human aortic smooth muscle cells were obtained from Takara Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human aortic smooth muscle cells at the sixth passage were transfected with GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL by using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). 24 h after transfection, the cells were starved for serum of 8 h and then stimulated with 1 μm ET-1. For the experiments with inhibitors, the cells were pretreated with inhibitors 30 min before ET-1 stimulation. Measurement of Cell Size—To measure the cell size, human aortic smooth muscle cells were transfected with plasmids by using the Nucleofector system and then seeded on glass coverslips coated with fibronectin (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 3.0% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and then treated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cell area was measured with a laser scanning confocal microscope (model LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochene, Germany). Counteraction of p190A RhoGAP Function by Rho-kinase—p190A and p190B RhoGAPs are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and display GAP activity exclusively toward RhoA in vivo (28Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Settleman J. Narasimhan V. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 539-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). p190RhoGAP activity accounts for ∼60% of the total RhoGAP activity detected in whole cell extracts in fibroblasts (30Vincent S. Settleman J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p190RhoGAP activity is sufficient to promote RhoA activation in fibroblasts (30Vincent S. Settleman J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Knockdown of p190A RhoGAP activity using siRNA increases RhoA activity in spreading microvascular endothelial cells (31Mammoto A. Huang S. Ingber D.E. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, p190RhoGAP appears to account for the majority of RhoGAP activity. Hence, we first examined whether Rho-kinase affects the p190A RhoGAP function in intact cells. GFP-RhoA was transfected into COS7 cells, and the amount of the GTP-bound form of GFP-RhoA was monitored by pulldown assay (Fig. 1). The expression of GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL decreased the amount of GTP-bound GFP-RhoA in COS7 cells, suggesting that GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL acts as RhoAGAP. The amount of GTP-bound GFP-RhoA was greater in the cells expressing GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL and GFP-Rho-kinase-CAT than that in the cells expressing GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL alone. This result suggests that Rho-kinase counteracts the GAP activity of p190A RhoGAP in COS7 cells. In Vitro Phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP by Rho-kinase—We then examined whether p190A RhoGAP is phosphorylated by Rho-kinase in vitro. To make a full length of p190A RhoGAP, we transiently transfected COS7 cells with GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL, and immunoprecipitated GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL from cell lysates with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody. The immunoprecipitated GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL was effectively phosphorylated by GST-Rho-kinase-CAT in vitro (Fig. 2B). We also found that Rho-kinase phosphorylated p190B RhoGAP (data not shown). To determine the phosphorylation sites of p190A RhoGAP by Rho-kinase, p190A RhoGAP was divided into five fragments, including GST-p190A RhoGAP-1 (aa 1–333), p190A RhoGAP-2 (aa 334–637), p190A RhoGAP-3 (aa 632–952), p190A RhoGAP-4 (aa 953–1208), and p190A RhoGAP-5 (aa 1209–1499) (Fig. 2A). These fragments were produced from E. coli and then purified. GST-p190A RhoGAP-4 and p190A RhoGAP-5 were effectively phosphorylated by GST-Rho-kinase-CAT, whereas GST-p190A RhoGAP-1, GST-p190A RhoGAP-2, and GST-p190A RhoGAP-3 were not phosphorylated (Fig. 2C). To identify potential phosphorylation sites in p190A RhoGAP, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was performed and three potential phosphorylation sites in p190A RhoGAP-4 were identified, namely Ser1150, Thr1173, and Ser1174 (Fig. 2D). To determine the major phosphorylation sites, we substituted Ser1150, Thr1173, or Ser1174 with Ala to produce GST-p190A RhoGAP-4-S1150A, GST-p190A RhoGAP-4-T1173A, and GST-p190A RhoGAP-4-S1174A. However, the single Ala substitution did not affect the phosphorylation efficiency (data not shown). Then, Ser1150, Thr1173, and Ser1174 were simultaneously substituted with Ala to produce GST-p190A RhoGAP-4-S1150A/T1173A/S1174A (GST-p190A RhoGAP-4-AAA). The phosphorylation efficiency of GST-p190A RhoGAP-4-AAA was substantially reduced compared with the wild type (Fig. 2E), suggesting that at least two potential phosphorylation sites among these three sites are efficient phosphorylation sites. The phosphorylation sites in p190A RhoGAP-5 were not identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. To identify potential phosphorylation sites in p190A RhoGAP-5, we produced the additional deletion mutants, including GST-p190A RhoGAP-ΔN1 (aa 1222–1499), p190A RhoGAP-ΔN2 (aa 1229–1499), and p190A RhoGAP-ΔN3 (aa 1249–1499) (Fig. 2A). GST-p190A RhoGAP-ΔN1 was highly phosphorylated and GST-p190A RhoGAP-ΔN2 was intermediately phosphorylated by GST-Rho-kinase-CAT, whereas GST-p190A RhoGAP-ΔN3 was not phosphorylated (supplemental Fig. S1A), suggesting that phosphorylation sites exist in aa 1222–1228 and aa 1229–1248. Because (R/K)XX(S/T) or (R/K)X(S/T) (X is any amino acid) is the consensus phosphorylation sequence by Rho-kinase, the potential phosphorylation sites in p190A-5 are Thr1226 in aa 1222–1228, and Ser1236 and Thr1241 in aa 1229–1248 (Fig. 2D), suggesting that Thr1226 is the putative major phosphorylation site. To determine the major phosphorylation sites in p190A RhoGAP-5, we produced GST-p190A RhoGAP-5-T1226A/S1236A (GST-p190A RhoGAP-5-AA) and GST-p190A RhoGAP-5-T1226A/T1241A. GST-p190A RhoGAP-5-AA was minimally phosphorylated by GST-Rho-kinase-CAT (Fig. 2F). The degree of phosphorylation of GST-p190A RhoGAP-5-T1226A/T1241A by GST-Rho-kinase-CAT was approximately half (supplemental Fig. S1B). Taken together, these results suggest that Rho-kinase phosphorylates p190A RhoGAP presumably at a minimum of five sites, including Ser1150, Thr1173, Ser1174, Thr1226, and Ser1236 in vitro. In Vivo Phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP by Rho-kinase—To examine the phosphorylation state of p190A RhoGAP by Rho-kinase in vivo, we prepared rabbit polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize p190A RhoGAP phosphorylated at respective phosphorylation sites. Among them, the anti-p190A RhoGAP-pS1150 antibody specifically recognized GST-p190A RhoGAP-4 phosphorylated by GST-Rho-kinase-CAT in a dose-dependent manner, but not phosphorylated GST-p190A RhoGAP-4-S1150A (Fig. 3A), indicating that the antibody specifically recognized GST-p190A RhoGAP-4 that was phosphorylated at Ser1150. The anti-p190A RhoGAP-pT1173 and pS1174 antibodies only slightly recognized phosphorylated p190A RhoGAP, suggesting that Thr1173 and Ser1174 are not major phosphorylation sites. Alternatively, these antibodies did not work well on phosphorylated p190A RhoGAP, although they recognized the antigen phosphopeptides (data not shown). The anti-p190A RhoGAP-pT1226 and -pS1236 antibodies could recognize the phosphorylated p190A RhoGAP in vitro in a manner similar to that of anti-p190A RhoGAP-pS1150 antibody (data not shown). To examine whether Rho-kinase phosphorylates p190A RhoGAP in intact cells, GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL was exogenously co-transfected with GFP-Rho-kinase-CAT into COS7 cells. Co-transfection of Rho-kinase-CAT resulted in an increase of phosphorylated GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL at Ser1150 (Fig. 3B). Treatment of the cells with Y-27632 inhibited phosphorylation of GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL by GFP-Rho-kinase-CAT. GFP-Rho-kinase-CAT failed to phosphorylate GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL-S1150A. Under the same conditions, phosphorylation of endogenous p190A RhoGAP at Ser1150 was not detected, presumably because the expression level of p190A RhoGAP was low in COS7 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Rho-kinase can phosphorylate p190A RhoGAP at Ser1150 in COS7 cells. Similarly, the immunoblot analysis, through the use of the anti-p190A RhoGAP-pT1226 and -pS1236 antibodies, revealed that Rho-kinase can phosphorylate p190A RhoGAP at Thr1226 and Ser1236 in COS7 cells (data not shown). Effects of Phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP by Rho-kinase on Its GAP Activity—Does phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP by Rho-kinase affect p190A RhoGAP functions? To examine the effects of phosphorylation on the GAP activity of p190A RhoGAP, we tried to produce and purify the full length of p190A RhoGAP from E. coli and insect cells, but the procedure failed. We then prepared nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated GST-p190A RhoGAP-4+5, which includes the identified five phosphorylation sites and the RhoGAP catalytic domain, and performed an in vitro GAP assay. Hydrolysis of GTP-bound GST-RhoA was accelerated by using purified GST-p190A RhoGAP-4+5 in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S2). The GAP activity of GFP-p190A RhoGAP-4+5 was not dramatically affected by phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B). We here found that Rho-kinase appeared to inhibit the p190A RhoGAP activity in COS7 cells (Fig. 1). How does Rho-kinase regulate the GAP activity of p190A RhoGAP in intact cells? Small GTPase Rnd is a member of the distinct subgroup of the Rho family GTPases and regulates the organization of actin cytoskeleton (32Chardin P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Expression of Rnd inhibits the formation of the stress fibers in response to lysophosphatidic acid stimulation in fibroblasts (33Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 141: 187-197Google Scholar), suggesting that Rnd antagonizes the action of RhoA. Consistently, Rnd binds to p190A RhoGAP and increases its GAP activity toward GTP-bound RhoA, resulting in RhoA inactivation (34Harada A. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18418-18424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Wennerberg K. Forget M.A. Ellerbroek S.M. Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Settleman J. Der C.J. Hansen S.H. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1106-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to examine whether phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP affects its interaction with Rnd1. HA-Rnd1 efficiently interacted with GST-p190A RhoGAP-4 in the pulldown assay, and phosphorylation of GST-p190A RhoGAP-4 by Rho-kinase attenuated its interaction with Rnd1 (Fig. 5). Thus, it is conceivable that Rho-kinase suppresses the GAP activity of p190A RhoGAP by inhibiting the interaction with Rnd1 through phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP in Cultured Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells—To understand the physiological functions of p190A RhoGAP, we confirmed the expression profile of p190A RhoGAP in various rat tissues and found that p190A RhoGAP was highly expressed in brain, lung, and aorta (supplemental Fig. S3A). We also found that p190A RhoGAP was highly expressed in primary human aortic smooth muscle and endothelial cells (supplemental Fig. S3B). Then, we monitored phosphorylation of endogenous p190A RhoGAP in human aortic smooth muscle cells. The basal phosphorylation level of p190A RhoGAP at Ser1150 was not detected (Fig. 6A). ET-1 is known to activate the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway (17Woodsome T.P. Polzin A. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1769-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Stimulation of smooth muscle cells by ET-1 induced phosphorylation of endogenous p190A RhoGAP at Ser1150 (Fig. 6A). Treatment of the cells with Y-27632 inhibited ET-1-induced phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP. As a positive control, the MYPT1 phosphorylation level was monitored. Phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr853 decreases the activity of myosin phosphatase in vascular smooth muscle cells: this phosphorylation is used as an indicator of the activity of Rho-kinase (17Woodsome T.P. Polzin A. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1769-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ET-1 induced phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr853, whereas Y-27632 completely inhibited this phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest that ET-1 provoked phosphorylation of endogenous p190A RhoGAP at Ser1150 in a Rho-kinase dependent fashion in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Of note, the immunoblot analysis using the anti-p190A RhoGAP-pT1226 and -pS1236 antibodies revealed that p190A RhoGAP was phosphorylated upon treatment with ET-1, but these phosphorylations were not dramatically inhibited by Y-27632, suggesting that these sites are not major phosphorylation sites by Rho-kinase in aortic smooth muscle cells (data not shown). A high concentration of ET-1 has been shown to induce activation of Rho/Rho-kinase and subsequent MYPT1 phosphorylation, thereby resulting in the sustained contraction of vascular smooth muscle (17Woodsome T.P. Polzin A. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1769-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We found that a high concentration of ET-1 induced sustained RhoA activation (supplemental Fig. S4), whereas Y-27632 suppressed ET-1-induced sustained RhoA activation (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S4), suggesting that Rho-kinase is involved in prolonged RhoA activation. Because the sensitivity of the anti-p190A RhoGAP-pS1150 antibody is relatively low, we transiently transfected cultured vascular smooth muscle cells with GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL to examine whether ET-1 induces sustained phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP in a Rho/Rho-kinase-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). ET-1 induced sustained phosphorylation of GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL at Ser1150, and Y-27632 effectively inhibited ET-1-induced phosphorylation of GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL. Under the same conditions, ET-1 induced sustained phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr853, whereas Y-27632 completely inhibited this phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). Other vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II, acetylcholine, and thrombin slightly induced phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP (data not shown). These results suggest that ET-1 induces sustained phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP at Ser1150 in a Rho/Rho-kinase-dependent manner in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. There are three different types of ET receptors, ETA, ETB, and ETC. ETB receptors are classified into two subtypes, ETB1 and ETB2.ETA and ETB2 receptors are expressed in vascular smooth muscle, and both receptors mediate vascular smooth muscle contraction (36Hynynen M.M. Khalil R.A. Recent Patents Cardiovasc. Drug Discov. 2006; 1: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To examine which types of ET receptors are involved in phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP, vascular smooth muscle cells transfected with GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL were treated with a selective ETA or ETB antagonist. BQ-123, a selective ETA antagonist, inhibited ET-1-induced RhoA activation and phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP, whereas BQ-788, a selective ETB antagonist, minimally affected ET-1-induced RhoA activation and phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP (Fig. 6, D and E). These results suggest that ET-1 induces p190A RhoGAP phosphorylation via RhoA activation through ETA receptor in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Because the activity of p190A RhoGAP is thought to be regulated through the tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases and Abl family kinases, we examined whether ET-1 affects the tyrosine phosphorylation state of p190A RhoGAP. Sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatase, increased the tyrosine phosphorylation level of GFP-190A RhoGAP-FL. Under the same condition, ET-1 did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP (supplemental Fig. S5). These results suggest that ET-1 did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Effect of Phosphomimic Mutant of p190A RhoGAP on Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Size—To explore the effect of phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP in vitro, we replaced three putative phosphorylation sites in p190A RhoGAP-4 with Glu to produce GST-p190A RhoGAP-4-EEE, the phosphomimic mutants. We first examined the effect of the Glu substitution on Rnd1 binding to p190A RhoGAP. HA-Rnd1 associated with GST-p190A RhoGAP-4-WT in the pulldown assay, whereas it associated less efficiently with GST-p190A RhoGAP-4-EEE (Fig. 7A), suggesting that the Glu substitution weakens the binding of Rnd1 to p190A RhoGAP. We next replaced five putative phosphorylation sites with Glu to produce GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL-5E to examine the effect of phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP on RhoA in intact cells. We found that the amount of GTP-bound GFP-RhoA was greater in the cells expressing GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL-5E than that in the cells expressing GFP-p190A RhoGAP-WT, suggesting that GFP-p190A RhoGAP-5E shows a weaker GAP activity than wild type (Fig. 7B). It was previously demonstrated that the constitutively active form of RhoA (RhoA Val14) induces the formation of stress fibers and decreases the size of vascular smooth muscle cells through contraction, whereas the dominant negative form of RhoA (RhoA Asn19) weakens the formation of stress fibers and increases the cell size (37Worth N.F. Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Rolfe B.E. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 59: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We employed this assay to compare the effects of p190A RhoGAP and GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL-5E on cell contraction. The vascular smooth muscle cells were transiently transfected with GFP-RhoA Asn19 or GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL-WT, and the cell sizes were measured. The expression of GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL-WT increased the cell size under these conditions, with GFP-RhoA Asn19 showing increased cell size (Fig. 7C), suggesting that basal RhoA activity is necessary for maintaining cell contractility. GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL-5E showed a weaker effect than that of GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL-WT (p < 0.01), suggesting that the GFP-p190A RhoGAP-FL-5E mutant mimics the phosphorylation state and shows weaker activity to inactivate RhoA. Here we show that Rho-kinase phosphorylated p190A RhoGAP in a cell-free system and identified putative phosphorylation sites, including Ser1150. Rho-kinase phosphorylated p190A RhoGAP at Ser1150 in intact cells. Phosphorylation by Rho-kinase of the p190A RhoGAP fragment containing the GAP domain did not affect GAP activity toward RhoA in a cell-free system. However, we found that constitutively active Rho-kinase could counteract p190A RhoGAP activity in intact cells. The binding of Rnd to p190A RhoGAP is thought to enhance its GAP activity (35Wennerberg K. Forget M.A. Ellerbroek S.M. Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Settleman J. Der C.J. Hansen S.H. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1106-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP by Rho-kinase inhibited its binding to Rnd. The phosphomimic mutant of p190A RhoGAP showed the weaker Rnd binding and RhoGAP activities. Thus, it is conceivable that Rho-kinase phosphorylates p190A RhoGAP and thereby inhibits its binding to Rnd, resulting in inactivation of p190A RhoGAP and subsequent prolonged RhoA activation. The primary action of ET-1 in vivo is to increase blood pressure and vascular tone. ET-1 was shown to activate Gq/G13, and to induce Ca2+ mobilization and subsequent phosphorylation of myosin light chain in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (38Gohla A. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). High concentrations of ET-1 cause long-lasting vasoconstriction (17Woodsome T.P. Polzin A. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1769-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The transient contractile phase is mediated by Gq and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase (39Hersch E. Huang J. Grider J.R. Murthy K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1209-C1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the sustained phase is mediated by G13-dependent activation of the Rho/Rho-kinase signaling pathway (39Hersch E. Huang J. Grider J.R. Murthy K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1209-C1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Consistently, high concentrations of ET-1 transiently induce Ca2+ mobilization in smooth muscle cells, which lasts for a minute (17Woodsome T.P. Polzin A. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1769-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we show that high concentrations of ET-1 induced sustained RhoA activation and p190RhoGAP phosphorylation in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells under the conditions in which ET-1 induced sustained MYPT1 phosphorylation. Y-27632 inhibited ET-1-induced phosphorylation of MYPT-1 as well as p190A RhoGAP and partly prohibited sustained RhoA activation, suggesting that ET-1 causes prolonged activation of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway. We also found that expression of p190A RhoGAP weakens the cell contractility, whereas the phosphomimic 5E mutant showed weaker activity than that of the wild type. Thus, it is possible that ET-1 induces the Rho/Rho-kinase activation and subsequent phosphorylation of p190A RhoGAP, thereby constituting the positive feedback loop to amplify Rho activation and promote contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells. ET-1 is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases such as essential hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and coronary vasospastic angina (40Agapitov A.V. Haynes W.G. J. Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst. 2002; 3: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The next challenge will be to explore whether p190A RhoGAP phosphorylation participates in these cardiovascular diseases. We are grateful for Dr. T. Itoh (Nagoya City University), members of Kaibuchi Laboratory, especially Dr. T. Watanabe and Dr. T. Hikita for helpful discussion, and T. Ishii for secretarial assistance.

Here, using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based A-kinase activity reporter (AKAR1), we find that PKA activity gradients form with the strongest activity at the leading edge and are restricted to the basal surface in migrating cells. The existence of these gradients was confirmed using immunocytochemistry using phospho-PKA substrate antibodies. This observation holds true for carcinoma cells migrating randomly on laminin-1 or stimulated to migrate on collagen I with lysophosphatidic acid. Phosphodiesterase inhibition allows the formation of PKA activity gradients; however, these gradients are no longer polarized. PKA activity gradients are not detected when a non-phosphorylatable mutant of AKAR1 is used, if PKA activity is inhibited with H-89 or protein kinase inhibitor, or when PKA anchoring is perturbed. We further find that a specific A-kinase anchoring protein, AKAP-Lbc, is a major contributor to the formation of these gradients. In summary, our data show that PKA activity gradients are generated at the leading edge of migrating cells and provide additional insight into the mechanisms of PKA regulation of cell motility.

In summary, our data show that PKA activity gradients are generated at the leading edge of migrating cells and provide additional insight into the mechanisms of PKA regulation of cell motility. Cell motility is controlled by a complex network of signals that are initiated by binding to the extracellular matrix. Understanding the biochemical mechanisms that control cell migration is necessary for better comprehension of processes like wound healing, embryonic development, and angiogenesis as well as cancer metastasis (1Lauffenburger D.A.

Previous studies have shown that cell motility is delicately controlled by synthesis and breakdown of cAMP through its effects on PKA. PKA regulates key signaling events that are critical for actin cytoskeletal remodeling and cell polarization during migration, including control of the activation states of RhoA, Rac, cdc42, Pak, and c-Abl. For example, PKA is known to inhibit the activation of RhoA, whereas it is required for the activation of Rac1, two proteins that are spatially regulated during cell migration. Therefore, it has been suggested that PKA activity in migrating cells is spatially regulated (5O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J.

The mounting evidence for the formation of cAMP/PKA gradients and their influence over directed cell motility is compelling. To conclusively determine that PKA activity gradients exist, the visualization of these gradients in single cells is needed to determine the nature of gradients and the mechanisms governing how they are formed. The compartmental action of cAMP was suggested over three decades ago (10Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. Lincoln T.M. Keely S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3854-3861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hayes J.S. Brunton L.L. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1982; 8: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar) and has hence been shown to mediate the precise spatiotemporal control of its effectors (12Jurevicius J. Fischmeister R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 296-299Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Rich T.C. Fagan K.A. Tse T.E. Schaack J. Cooper D.M. Karpen J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Magalhaes P. Pozzan T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Tight control of cAMP levels is governed by the coordinated actions of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and adenylyl cyclases. Gradients of cAMP and, thus, PKA activity are expected to exist in a cell. This idea is based, most simplistically, on the fact that cAMP is generated by membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases and broken down by cytosolic PDEs; that is, the two arms of cAMP metabolism are spatially separated. Further compartmentalization of PKA activity also occurs as a result of the anchoring of PKA and cAMP-specific PDEs to A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which has been demonstrated in a variety of cell types (16Dodge K.L. Khouangsathiene S. Kapiloff M.S. Mouton R. Hill E.V. Houslay M.D. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 17Taskén K.A. Collas P. Kemmner W.A. Witczak O. Conti M. Taskén K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21999-22002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The anchoring of PKA occurs typically through the binding of the type II regulatory (RII) subunits to AKAPs where the relative levels of PDE activity and cAMP generated regulate the regional activity of PKA. PKA anchoring, in addition to cAMP synthesis and degradation, is believed to control spatial signaling of PKA (14Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 15Zaccolo M. Magalhaes P. Pozzan T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Until recently, we have lacked both the model systems and technology to adequately study the possibility that cAMP/PKA activity gradients exist. We and others (5O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 6O'Connor K.L. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 2004; 1692: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) have established that polarization and migration of cells are dependent on cAMP synthesis and breakdown. Here, we sought to demonstrate the existence of cAMP/PKA gradients in single migrating cells using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based PKA biosensor A-kinase activity reporter (AKAR1) and determine how signaling components that regulate PKA activity, including cAMP synthesis, PDEs, and PKA anchoring, affect the formation of these gradients. Cell Transfection and Treatments—Clone A colon carcinoma cells were grown to 70% confluence in RPMI plus 10% fetal calf serum before transfection with AKAR1, a non-phosphorylatable (S475A) mutant of AKAR1 (courtesy of Dr. Jin Zhang, Department of Pharmacology, Johns Hopkins University) (18Zhang J.

At 24 h post-transfection cells were detached by trypsinization and washed 3 times with RPMI medium containing 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were treated for 30 min with either 1 mm IBMX, 25 μm forskolin, 15 μm H-89, or 20 μm myristoylated protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) or for 5 min with 5 μm stHt31 or stHt31P (negative control for stHt31) as indicated. Cells were then plated onto coverslips coated with laminin-1 (10 μg/ml) in the presence of drug for 55 min at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed for 20 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 7% sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Coverslips were then mounted with MOWIOL mounting medium (Calbiochem). Cells with recombinant protein expression levels high enough to give good fluorescence signal in lamellae were chosen for analysis. For experiments using MDA-MB-231 cells, cells were grown to 70% confluence, suspended by trypsinization, and plated onto collagen-coated coverslips in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin for 2-3 h. Cells were then stimulated with 100 nm lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) for 15 min or left untreated before fixation. FRET Image Collection—Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-510 META confocal microscope with a 63×, 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Optical Imaging Laboratory, University of Texas Medical Branch). The images where collected using two lines of excitation (458 and 514 nm, argon ion laser) and two different channels of emission. The intensity of fluorescence of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) after CFP excitation at 458 nm (donor signal, IDD) was obtained using a 470-500-nm bandpass filter. The intensity of fluorescence of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; acceptor signal, IAA) after excitation of YFP at 514 nm and the fluorescence intensity of FRET signal (raw FRET signal, IDA) after excitation at 458 nm were measured using a 530-570-nm filter. All images were collected using 4-frame Kallman-averaging with a pixel time of 1.60 μs, a pixel size of 90 × 90 nm (scan zoom of 2 and a frame size of 792 × 792 pixels), and an optical slice of 0.8 μm. Because of the cell to cell variability of AKAR1 expression levels, the detector gains and the amplifier offsets were adjusted as needed to maximize the range of signal for each channel; however, the ratios between the gains of the three channels were kept constant. For each imagining session, the same collection conditions were used for cells expressing AKAR1 constructs, YFP, or CFP. Image Processing—Images were imported into Metamorph software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) for processing. Initially, background was subtracted from all images based on the signal of non-cellular regions, and a low-pass filter was applied using a 5 × 5 kernel to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (19van Rheenen J. Langeslag M. Jalink K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2517-2529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To obtain a corrected FRET image (Fc), we processed the raw FRET image (IDA) to compensate for nonspecific signals in the FRET channel, such as channel cross-talk due to the spectral overlap between CFP and YFP, defined by the equation Fc = IDA-aIAA-dIDD (20Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 21Youvan D.C. Coleman W.J. Silva C.M. Petersen J.

J. 1984; 45: 939-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), where a and d represent cross-talk correction coefficients. The Fc values were then divided by the acceptor emission after direct acceptor excitation (IAA) yielding the normalized FRET index (Fc/YFP), as proposed by van Rheenen et al. (19van Rheenen J. Langeslag M. Jalink K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2517-2529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which permitted the acquisition of higher resolution images under the conditions used here. These calculations correct for nonspecific signals present in specified channels, normalize for expression of the reporter construct throughout the cell, and render a FRET index independent of laser fluctuations (23Zal T. Gascoigne N.R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3923-3939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The cross-talk coefficients (a and d) were calculated using images collected from cells expressing either CFP (donor) or YFP (acceptor) alone. Coefficient a was obtained from the ratio of IDA over IAA for acceptor-only samples, whereas the coefficient d was obtained from the ratio of IDA over IDD for donor-only samples. For each imaging session, averages of coefficients a and d were calculated from at least 25 non-saturated regions using at least two different cells and three different sets of gains (note that there was no significant difference noted between the coefficients calculated at the different gains provided that the ratio between the gain intensities for the individual channels was kept constant). The constants were then used to calculate sensitized emission of the Fc for images collected on the same day. The Fc values were then normalized to the local concentration of construct using acceptor emission and reported as a ratio (Fc/YFP) as reported previously (19van Rheenen J. Langeslag M. Jalink K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2517-2529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For each cell analyzed, the average pixel intensity of Fc/YFP signal versus distance in microns was plotted such that the last distance point represents the edge of the cell, which represents the FRET gradient. For experiments involving siRNA-treated cells, the slopes of multiple line scans were calculated, averaged, and reported in a histogram plot (untreated, n = 20; non-targeting siRNA, n = 19; AKAP-Lbc siRNA number 3, n = 11, and number 5, n = 9). The slopes were taken from the last 90 pixels (equivalent to 8 μm) of each line scan, where the gradients of Fc/YFP are consistently found in untreated cells. This approach was used to standardize the distance analyzed from the leading edge to the cell body and to avoid selection bias. For all data cells shown represent cells from at least two coverslips and a minimum of three separate experiments. PKA Assays—Active PKA was assessed by pseudosubstrate affinity precipitation of cell lysates, as described (24Paulucci-Holthauzen A.A. O'Connor K.L. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 355: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on laminin-coated dishes in the presence of select inhibitors and then harvested in a hypotonic buffer and gently sonicated. A portion of cleared lysates (1 part) was set aside as a loading control, and the remaining lysate (10 parts) was incubated with beads conjugated to glutathione S-transferase-PKI fusion protein for 30 min at 4 °C and then rinsed. Glutathione S-transferase-PKI (active)-bound PKA and lysate controls (10% total) were then immunoblotted for the PKA catalytic subunit (BD Transduction Laboratories). Several exposures were analyzed and quantified by digital capture of luminescence using a Fluorochem™ 8900 luminescent imager (Alpha Innotech) to ensure that signals remain in the linear range. Small Interference RNA Treatment—Suspended cells (3 × 106) were electroporated with 16 μg of AKAR1 alone or in conjunction with 200 nm siRNA specific for AKAP-Lbc (AKAP13) or a control (non-targeting) sequence (Dharmacon, Inc.) as reported previously (25Chen M. O'Connor K.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5125-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Individual sequences for AKAP-Lbc are UCAACAGACUCACUAAAUAUU (number 3) and GGAAGAAGCUUGUACGUGAUU (number 5). Cells were then kept in normal growth medium for 48 h and then assessed for target gene expression using immunoblot analysis, PKA-FRET, or cell migration. Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 15 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma Aldrich) and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Total protein was then electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was cut, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, and then probed for either AKAP-Lbc (1:5000 dilution, rabbit polyclonal, VO-96, supplied by Dr. Ben Pedroja, Vollum Institute/OHSU) or β-tubulin (1:1000 dilution, rat monoclonal antibody 1864, Chemicon). Migration Assays—For laminin haptotaxis assays the lower compartments of Transwell chambers (6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size; Costar) were coated with 15 μg/ml laminin-1. Cells (1 × 105) suspended in RPMI/bovine serum albumin were added to the upper chamber and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were removed from the upper chamber with a cotton swab, and migrated cells on the lower membrane surface were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and quantified visually as described previously (26O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.-K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 7% sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then rinsed. Cells were incubated in block solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min and then incubated overnight with 1:100 dilution of phospho-PKA substrate (RRXS/T) monoclonal antibody (100G7, Cell Signaling Technologies) in block solution at 4 °C. After three 10-min phosphate-buffered saline washes, cells were incubated with either Alexa 594- or Alexa 488-conjugated secondary, rinsed, mounted with MOWIOL mounting medium (Calbiochem), and imaged by confocal microscopy. Statistics—Pairwise comparisons between AKAR-transfected versus each of the non-targeting (NT) and siRNA groups were carried out using the two-sample t test. Normality and equal variance assumptions were assessed, and log transformation was employed as necessary before conduct of the parametric tests. To determine the spatial distribution of PKA activity in migrating cells, we utilized the previously characterized AKAR1 single-molecule FRET sensor (18Zhang J. Ma Y. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14997-15002Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). AKAR1 contains a modified Kemptide sequence that can be phosphorylated by PKA and the phosphoamino acid binding domain of 14-3-3τ, which binds to this phosphorylated sequence. These domains are flanked by CFP and YFP that display FRET upon binding of the phosphorylated Kemptide sequence to the 14-3-3τ domain, thereby indicating where PKA is active. The FRET emitted by this construct is initiated by PKA and is likely terminated by an uncharacterized phosphatase. Thus, this signal represents the lifetime of phosphate for a single type of PKA substrate. As a cell model for assessing the nature of PKA activity gradients during migration, we utilize the cAMP-sensitive Clone A migration model. Clone A cells adhere to and migrate randomly on laminin-1 by signaling through the α2β1 and α6β4 integrins (27Rabinovitz I. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1873-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Migrating Clone A cells form a polarized morphology in which the leading edge is marked with a ruffling lamellipodium. Time-lapse videomicroscopic analysis of these cells shows that cells migrate in a forward direction toward the lamellipodial ruffle. If multiple lamellipodia are present, one will eventually become dominant, and the cell will move in the direction of the new dominant lamellae (data not shown). Therefore, we are able to identify migrating cells by the presence of a lamellipodial ruffle which signifies the leading edge and retraction fibers at the trailing edge. To determine the spatial distribution of cAMP/PKA activity, Clone A cells transfected with either AKAR1, a non-phosphorylatable mutant (S475A) of AKAR1, CFP-only, or YFP-only constructs were allowed to migrate on laminin-1 and then fixed. Lamellar area quantification of cells transfected with AKAR1 and untreated cells notably shows that cells expressing the AKAR1 construct display no differences in morphology when compared with untreated cells (n for each condition equals 20; data not shown). Cells expressing levels of construct sufficient for good resolution of fluorescent signal in the lamellar region were then imaged using a confocal microscope with a three-filter set for the determination of sensitized acceptor emission or corrected FRET (Fc) (20Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 21Youvan D.C. Coleman W.J. Silva C.M. Petersen J. Bylina E.J. Yang M.M. Biotechnology et alia. 1997; 1: 1-16Google Scholar), as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Correction coefficients for bleed-through were calculated from cells transfected with CFP or YFP alone. This method of obtaining FRET values has been proven to generate high resolution images (20Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 28Oliveria S.F. Gomez L.L. Dell'Acqua M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that are independent of the photoconversion of YFP into CFP-like species that occurs during acceptor photobleaching experiments (29Valentin G. Verheggen C. Piolot T. Neel H. Coppey-Moisan M. Bertrand E. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 801Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The Fc value was then normalized to the local concentration of construct and reported as a ratio with acceptor emissions (Fc/YFP) as previously suggested (19van Rheenen J. Langeslag M. Jalink K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2517-2529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), permitting a more accurate read-out for PKA activity. Under wide-field optics, the larger volume and, thus, higher fluorescence within the cell body caused light scattering that prevented definition of cell borders and lamellar structures. Therefore, confocal analysis was necessary to obtain proper resolution. As shown in Fig. 1A, Clone A cells induced to migrate on laminin-1 show a higher Fc/YFP signal within lamellae with a marked gradient of increasing intensity culminating at the leading edge, indicating higher PKA activity in this region and the presence of a gradient of PKA activity (representative of 14 of 15 cells imaged). Further analysis of line scans within the image show graphically that the Fc/YFP ratio increases dramatically in the lamellae area, demonstrating that PKA activity is spatially distributed within the cell during migration. To confirm that the observed gradients in Fc/YFP signal are specific to PKA activity and not a result of cell processing, image handling, or phosphorylation of AKAR1 from another kinase, several controls were performed. Initially, cells were transfected with the S475A mutant of AKAR1 that cannot be phosphorylated by PKA and, therefore, should not emit FRET as demonstrated previously (18Zhang J. Ma Y. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14997-15002Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Cells plated on laminin-1 that were chosen for analysis were morphologically similar to those expressing the AKAR1 construct and were processed in an identical manner. In Fig. 1B we show that cells expressing the S475A mutant construct displayed very low FRET and were devoid of any apparent gradient in the residual signal, as shown by the Fc/YFP panels (representative of 7 of 7 cells analyzed) and line scan graphics and region analysis. Next, we sought to confirm that the FRET signal observed was specific and a direct result of PKA activity. For these experiments we treated AKAR1-expressing cells with PKA-specific inhibitors, H-89, and the naturally occurring PKI before and during migration on laminin-1. Clone A cells are unique in the fact that they continue to form lamellae and membrane ruffles under conditions in which PKA is inhibited, as they utilize RhoA for these processes and not Rac1 (26O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.-K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which requires PKA activity to function (6O'Connor K.L. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47895-47900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 7Howe A.K. Baldor L.C. Hogan B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45838-45846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, the contributions of PKA to the FRET signal in AKAR1-expressing cells can still be monitored in lamellar structures. Here, we find that cells treated with H-89 (Fig. 1C; representative of 10-12 cells imaged) or PKI (Fig. 1D; representative of 7 of 9 cells imaged) show minimal FRET and no PKA activity gradients similar to cells expressing the S475A AKAR1 mutant. Notably, the PKA activity gradients are present predominantly in the lamellae (∼0.1 μm in thickness) where the cell volume is less than the optical sections taken within the cell body (0.8 μm thick). To confirm that our results are not a consequence of changes in the intracellular concentration of AKAR1 or the shallow depth at the periphery, we performed region analysis of cells. Regions 1 and 2 where chosen to contain similar YFP intensities where region 1 is present in the cell body and region 2 is found near the leading edge. Region 3 was chosen at the leading edge and contains the same area as regions 1 and 2. As shown in the histograms in Fig. 1A, we observe that region 2 contains an increased average Fc/YFP intensity compared with region 1 in untreated cells. Region 3 in these cells displays even higher Fc/YFP intensity, thus confirming the presence of a gradient. In contrast, the S475 construct-transfected cells or H89 or PKI-treated cells show no change or a decrease in FRET intensity between regions. Collectively, these data confirm that the FRET signal detected with AKAR1 in migrating cells is specifically due to the PKA phosphorylation of the AKAR1 construct and is in agreement with the specificity demonstrated by the original characterization of AKAR1 (18Zhang J. Ma Y. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14997-15002Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKA activity gradients exist vertically within the lamellipodium, we analyzed serial confocal sections of migrating Clone A cells expressing the AKAR1 construct at 0.2-μm intervals. As depicted in Fig. 2, the gradients are found primarily within the basal most section. These data demonstrate that the PKA activity gradients are tightly associated with the basal plasma membrane within close proximity to the regions where new integrin contacts are being made during the migratory process. These observations suggest that cAMP/activated PKA gradi"

Obesity adversely alters renal and adipose tissue function, resulting in chronic kidney disease and insulin resistance, respectively, the latter associated with dysregulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In view of the current obesity epidemic, we explored the combined effects of in utero early- to midgestational nutrient restriction and postnatal obesity on the UPR in ovine juvenile offspring. Nutrient restriction was coincident with fetal kidney development but prior to exponential adipose tissue deposition. Nutrient restricted (NR) and normal diet (control) offspring were exposed to an obesogenic environment throughout adolescence, resulting in similar degrees of juvenile obesity. NR offspring showed enhanced adipose tissue dysregulation characterized by activation of the UPR, perturbed insulin signaling, and marked inflammation, as demonstrated by increased abundance of crownlike structures and proinflammatory genes. Conversely, in renal tissue NR offspring had marked attenuation of cellular stress and inflammation evident as reduced activation of the UPR, down-regulation of proinflammatory genes, and less histological damage. In conclusion, obesity-related activation of the UPR can be determined by the in utero nutritional environment, demonstrating organ-specific effects dependent on the developmental phase targeted within the fetus."

Unlike T cells, NK cells do not require pre-activation by dendritic cells and are thus primed to kill directly upon encounter with an appropriate target (7Moretta A. Marcenaro E. Parolini S.

The granule-dependent pathway to cell death is characterized by perforin-mediated delivery of the contents of cytotoxic granules from an NK cell to the target cell cytosol. Contained within these granules are a number of destructive proteases called granzymes, which promote cell death through the proteolysis of proteins within the target cell (8Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 9Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 15: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Five human granzymes have been described, and each has a different substrate specificity, which suggests that they orchestrate cell death via distinct pathways (10Grossman W.J. Revell P.A. Lu Z.H.

After target cell entry, granzyme A moves to the nucleus where it releases inhibition of the endonuclease NM23-H1 by proteolysis of its inhibitor, SET, thereby freeing NM23-H1 to mediate the single strand DNA nicks synonymous with granzyme A-induced cell death (25Fan Z. Beresford P.J. Zhang D. Xu Z. Novina C.D. Yoshida A. Pommier Y. Lieberman J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Granzyme M (a Metase) is highly expressed in NK cells but not in primary T cells (26Smyth M.J. Sayers T.J. Wiltrout T. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6195-6205PubMed Google Scholar, 27Smyth M.J. Wiltrout T. Trapani J.A. Ottaway K.S. Sowder R. Henderson L.E. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Young H.A. Sayers T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24418-24425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests a unique role for this granzyme in innate immune system function. Indeed, studies using mice deficient for granzyme M have suggested a role for this granzyme in the clearance of mouse cytomegalovirus (28Pao L.I. Sumaria N. Kelly J.M. van Dommelen S. Cretney E. Wallace M.E. Anthony D.A. Uldrich A.P. Godfrey D.I. Papadimitriou J.M. Mullbacher A. Degli-Esposti M.A. Smyth M.J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Initial studies suggested that this protease instigated a caspase and BCL-2-independent form of cell death, distinct from that promoted by granzyme A or granzyme B, with dying cells exhibiting a necrosis-like phenotype (29Kelly J.M. Waterhouse N.J. Cretney E. Browne K.A. Ellis S. Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, a recent study has indicated that granzyme M may promote target cell death in a manner similar to granzyme B, by directly cleaving both caspases and ICAD (30Lu H. Hou Q. Zhao T. Zhang H. Zhang Q. Wu L. Fan Z. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Granzyme M has also been proposed to promote the death of target cells through the generation of reactive oxygen species, partly by proteolytic inactivation of heat shock protein 75 (31Hua G. Zhang Q. Fan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20553-20560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the authors of the latter report also found that recombinant granzyme M induced mitochondrial swelling, initiated a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and promoted the release of cytochrome c (31Hua G. Zhang Q. Fan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20553-20560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which again suggests a mode of action similar to that of granzyme B. These conflicting data, which highlight inconsistencies concerning our current understanding of the mechanism of granzyme M-mediated killing, prompted us to undertake a detailed analysis of this “orphan” granzyme, paying particular attention to proposed similarities with the mode of action of granzyme B. Here we report that, in contrast to granzyme B, granzyme M induced a predominantly necrosis-like morphology in target cells and was incapable of activating caspases. We also identified the nucleolar phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (NPM) as a direct substrate of granzyme M. We show that NPM is essential for cell survival, because siRNA-mediated ablation of NPM expression led to spontaneous cell death. Importantly, cell death could be rescued by overexpression of full-length but not truncated forms of NPM that mimicked the granzyme M-cleaved forms of this protein. This suggests that proteolysis of this essential protein by granzyme M abolishes its function and thus may limit the oncogenic potential of NPM-associated tumors.

Cell death was subsequently assessed by flow cytometry using annexin V/PI staining (12Martin S.J. Aramante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A. Fitzgerald P. Tan E.M. Bokoch G.M.

Production of Recombinant Granzymes in Pichia pastoris—Recombinant granzyme B was expressed and purified from P. pastoris, and its activity was determined as described previously (66Cullen S.P.

For comparison, we also delivered P. pastoris-derived human granzyme B into Jurkat cells in a similar manner. As shown in Fig. 1A, loading of Jurkat cells with granzyme B led to rapid cell death (within 4 h), as assessed by annexin V staining and propidium iodide (PI) uptake. Granzyme B-treated cells exhibited all of the typical features of apoptosis, with distinctive membrane blebbing, and became annexin V-positive in the absence of PI uptake (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of caspases, by inclusion of the polycaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk in the assay, transiently delayed apoptosis induced by granzyme B, as expected (Fig. 1, A and B). After 24 h however, all granzyme B-treated cells had died (Fig. 1, A and B), regardless of the inclusion of caspase inhibitor, most likely due to BID-mediated targeting of mitochondria by granzyme B (17Heibein J.A.

In marked contrast, loading of cells with granzyme M initiated rapid cell death, characterized by rapid cell swelling and extensive cell lysis typical of necrosis, and cells became simultaneously double-positive for annexin V and PI (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, preincubation of target cells with z-VAD-fmk did not afford protection from granzyme M-mediated killing (Fig. 1, A and B). These data strongly suggest that granzyme M promotes a lytic form of cell death, which does not involve caspase activation or display features of apoptosis (Fig. 1, A and B). Granzyme M Fails to Cleave Caspases or BID—To further explore whether granzyme M is capable of activating caspases, we added this granzyme to Jurkat CFE and monitored caspase activation. Granzyme B was used as a control, because this granzyme readily processes caspases. Western blot analysis demonstrated that, although 300 nm granzyme B efficiently cleaved caspase-3, -7, and -8, an identical concentration of granzyme M did not (Fig. 2A). As a more sensitive readout of caspase activation, we measured hydrolysis of the caspase-3/-7 fluorogenic peptide substrate, DEVD-AFC. Fig. 2B illustrates that, although granzyme B promoted very efficient DEVD hydrolysis in cell-free extracts, no caspase activity was detectable in response to granzyme M. Granzyme M has recently been shown to promote the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (31Hua G. Zhang Q. Fan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20553-20560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and, in light of this, we asked whether this granzyme could mediate cytochrome c release by cleaving BID, in a manner similar to granzyme B. Fig. 2C demonstrates that, although 300 nm granzyme B efficiently cleaved BID, an equal concentration of granzyme M did not. Together, these data strongly suggest that granzyme M does not activate caspases or BID and thus, promotes cell death in a fashion distinct from that mediated by granzyme B. Nucleophosmin Is a Substrate for Granzyme M—As recent studies have demonstrated a similarity between the killing mechanism of granzyme B and granzyme M, we explored whether these granzymes might share similar substrates. Therefore, we screened a panel of known granzyme B substrates for proteolysis by granzyme M, with Jurkat cell-free extract used as a source of human substrate proteins. Fig. 2C demonstrates that the abundant nucleolar phosphoprotein, NPM, is a direct granzyme M substrate, with proteolysis going to completion at 300 nm. A small difference in the molecular weight of the granzyme B and granzyme M-mediated cleavage products suggested that granzyme M cleaved NPM at a site close to that recognized by granzyme B (Fig. 2C). Although granzyme B efficiently cleaved a range of other known substrates, including α-Tubulin, granzyme M did not. Of note, granzyme M failed to process both ICAD and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is at odds with a previous report (30Lu H. Hou Q. Zhao T. Zhang H. Zhang Q. Wu L. Fan Z. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition to screening known granzyme B substrates, we also assessed proteolysis of a panel of caspase substrates by granzyme M. Fig. 2D demonstrates that PAK2 was also cleaved by granzyme M. None of the other caspase substrates tested were cleaved by granzyme M, but interestingly, fodrin, vimentin, and RhoGDI were cleaved by granzyme B, albeit at a high granzyme concentration (300 nm) (Fig. 2D). We also undertook Western blot analysis of members of the BCL-2 family; however, this failed to yield novel substrates for either granzyme (Fig. 2E). In addition, adding both granzyme B and M to cell-free extracts did not have an additive effect on caspase activation or substrate proteolysis (Fig. 2). Of note, we found granzyme M to be non-promiscuous at the concentrations used in this study as incubation of this protease with Jurkat. CFE failed to reveal any detectable changes to the Jurkat cell proteome as assessed by one-dimensional gel analysis, whereas caspase activation induced many detectable alterations to the proteome when analyzed by the same method (supplemental Fig. S1). Nucleophosmin Is an in Vivo Granzyme M Substrate—To assess the efficiency of proteolysis of NPM and PAK2 by granzyme M, we titrated granzyme M and granzyme B into Jurkat cell-free extract. Granzyme M induced efficient proteolysis of NPM, down to 19 nm, whereas in contrast, 150 nm granzyme B was required for NPM proteolysis (Fig. 3A). Thus, NPM is a better substrate for granzyme M than for granzyme B. Granzyme M also cleaved PAK-2; however, proteolysis was much less efficient than for NPM, with cleavage observed only at 300 nm (Fig. 3A). To confirm that NPM was an authentic substrate for granzyme M, we assessed the extent of proteolysis during granzyme M-mediated killing of Jurkat cells. 300 nm granzyme M was sufficient to induce 60% cell death (Fig. 3B), and efficient proteolysis of NPM was detected by Western blot under these conditions (Fig. 3C). In contrast, 300 nm granzyme B killed 90% of the cells but only weakly cleaved NPM, demonstrating that NPM is a substantially better in vivo substrate for granzyme M than for granzyme B (Fig. 3, B and C). PAK-2 was also processed by granzyme M under these conditions (Fig. 3C). In an effort to determine the contribution of granzyme M to NPM proteolysis in a NK cell context, we also explored a number of commercially available calpain and lysosomal protease inhibitors in an effort to perturb granzyme M activity. However, we were unable to inhibit granzyme M in Jurkat CFEs, while z-VAD-fmk efficiently inhibited caspases under the same conditions (supplemental Fig. S2). Granzyme M Cleaves NPM at Leu-158—To identify the granzyme M cleavage site within NPM, we cleaved recombinant NPM with granzyme M and analyzed the cleavage products by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4A). This revealed that granzyme M cleaved NPM somewhere between amino acids Lys-155 and Ser-195 (Fig. 4A). Using a peptide-based screening approach, two groups have independently determined the substrate specificity of granzyme M (32Rukamp B.J. Kam C.M. Natarajan S. Bolton B.W. Smyth M.J. Kelly J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2158728023,"Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that play key roles in metabolism, energy production, and apoptosis. Coordination of these processes is essential to maintain normal cellular functions. Here we characterized hNOA1, the human homologue of AtNOA1 (Arabidopsis thaliana nitric oxide-associated protein 1), a large mitochondrial GTPase. By immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy, and mitochondrial subfractionation, endogenous hNOA1 is localized within mitochondria where it is peripherally associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane facing the mitochondrial matrix. Overexpression and knockdown of hNOA1 led to changes in mitochondrial shape implying effects on mitochondrial dynamics. To identify the interaction partners of hNOA1 and to further understand its cellular functions, we performed immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous hNOA1 from enriched mitochondrial fractions and found that hNOA1 interacts with both Complex I of the electron transport chain and DAP3 (death-associated protein 3), a positive regulator of apoptosis. Knockdown of hNOA1 reduces mitochondrial O(2) consumption approximately 20% in a Complex I-dependent manner, supporting a functional link between hNOA1 and Complex I. Moreover, knockdown of hNOA1 renders cells more resistant to apoptotic stimuli such as gamma-interferon and staurosporine, supporting a role for hNOA1 in regulating apoptosis. Thus, based on its interactions with both Complex I and DAP3, hNOA1 may play a role in mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2162277420,"Inferring the intensity of positive selection in protein-coding genes is important since it is used to shed light on the process of adaptation. Recently, it has been reported that overlapping genes, which are ubiquitous in all domains of life, seem to exhibit inordinate degrees of positive selection. Here, we present a new method for the simultaneous estimation of selection intensities in overlapping genes. We show that the appearance of positive selection is caused by assuming that selection operates independently on each gene in an overlapping pair, thereby ignoring the unique evolutionary constraints on overlapping coding regions. Our method uses an exact evolutionary model, thereby voiding the need for approximation or intensive computation. We test the method by simulating the evolution of overlapping genes of different types as well as under diverse evolutionary scenarios. Our results indicate that the independent estimation approach leads to the false appearance of positive selection even though the gene is in reality subject to negative selection. Finally, we use our method to estimate selection in two influenza A genes for which positive selection was previously inferred. We find no evidence for positive selection in both cases."
https://openalex.org/W1973611155,"The striatum is particularly vulnerable to neurological disorders, such as Huntington disease. Previous studies, with nonsynaptic mitochondria isolated from cortical and striatal homogenates, suggest that striatal mitochondria are highly vulnerable to Ca2+ loads, possibly influencing striatal vulnerability. However, whether and how neuronal and glial mitochondria from cortex and striatum differ in Ca2+ vulnerability remains unknown. We test this hypothesis using a novel strategy allowing comparisons of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity in cortical and striatal neuron-astrocyte co-cultures. We provide original evidence that mitochondria not only in neurons but also in astrocytes from striatal origin exhibit a decreased Ca2+ buffering capacity when compared with cortical counterparts. The decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity in striatal versus cortical astrocytes does not stem from variation in mitochondrial concentration or in the rate of intracellular Ca2+ elevation, being mechanistically linked to an increased propensity to undergo cyclosporin A (CsA)-sensitive permeability transition. Indeed, 1 μm CsA selectively increased the mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity of striatal astrocytes, without modifying that of neurons or cortical astrocytes. Neither thapsigargin nor FK506 modified mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering differences between cell types, excluding a predominant contribution of endoplasmic reticulum or calcineurin. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms of striatal vulnerability, showing that the increased Ca2+ vulnerability of striatal versus cortical mitochondria resides in both intact neurons and astrocytes, thus positioning the striatum at greater risk for disturbed neuron-astrocyte interactions.

Brustovetsky T. Purl K.J. Capano M. Crompton M. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4858-4867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because isolated mitochondria are deprived from its physiological cellular context, and brain homogenates contain mitochondria from both neurons and glia, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: first, whether the differences in Ca2+ vulnerability, observed with isolated mitochondria, also occur in situ (i.e. when mitochondria are in their physiological environment inside intact cells) and, second, whether mitochondrial vulnerability to Ca2+ loads differs among neurons and glia from cortex and striatum.Striatal selectivity in HD is noteworthy, given that the disease-causing protein (mutant huntingtin) is widely expressed throughout the brain and not enriched in the striatum (3Li S.H. Schilling G. Young III, W.S. Li X.J. Margolis R.L. Stine O.C. Wagster M.V. Abbott M.H. Franz M.L. Ranen N.G. Folstein S.E. Hedreen J. Ross C.A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 985-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although HD may also affect nonstriatal regions, namely the cortex (4Rosas H.D. Salat D.H. Lee S.Y. Zaleta A.K. Pappu V. Fischl B. Greve D. Hevelone N. Hersch S.M. Brain. 2008; 131: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), typical striatal atrophy and neuronal loss greatly exceed those seen in nonstriatal regions, particularly when HD is not superimposed with Alzheimer's disease or age-related volumetric loss (5Vonsattel J.P. DiFiglia M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). This suggests that vulnerability factors inherent to striatal neurons shape the selective pattern of HD neurodegeneration. One likely factor is the enrichment in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors containing NR2B subunits, allowing prolonged Ca2+ influx following excitotoxic stimuli (6Cowan C.M. Raymond L.A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2006; 75: 25-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), but other vulnerability factors may assist. Mitochondria have an essential role in neuronal survival following excitotoxic [Ca2+]i elevations (7Nicholls D.G. Budd S.L. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar), and mitochondria-dependent Ca2+ handling is impaired in striatal neurons from HD mice (8Oliveira J.M. Chen S. Almeida S. Riley R. Goncalves J. Oliveira C.R. Hayden M.R. Nicholls D.G. Ellerby L.M. Rego A.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11174-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HD may in fact be aggravating inherent mitochondrial vulnerability in the striatum, which may reside in either neurons or glia. Indeed, glia may also contribute for non-cell-autonomous neurodegeneration in HD (9Lobsiger C.S. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) or ischemic injuries (10Bambrick L. Kristian T. Fiskum G. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Dienel G.A. Hertz L. Glia. 2005; 50: 362-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), thus stressing the importance of identifying vulnerability factors in both neurons and glia.In the present study, we test the hypothesis that mitochondrial vulnerability to Ca2+ loads differs among intact neurons and astrocytes from cortex and striatum. We prepared primary neuron-astrocyte co-cultures from rat cortex and striatum, whose cellular composition and functional differentiation were confirmed by immunolabeling and functional imaging studies, respectively. Here we report for the first time not only the development but also the application of an experimental strategy allowing comparisons of in situ mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity in the preserved physiological context of intact brain cells. To allow balanced comparisons, similarly to standard procedures with isolated mitochondria experiments, we have introduced calibrations for differences in mitochondrial concentration and rate of intracellular Ca2+ elevation in intact cells.Results in the present study provide additional insight into the mechanisms of striatal vulnerability, showing for the first time that the increased vulnerability of striatal mitochondria to Ca2+ loads is present in both intact neurons and astrocytes when compared with their cortical counterparts. Interestingly, our finding of a lower mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity in intact striatal versus cortical astrocytes, mechanistically linked to increased cyclosporin A-dependent permeability transition, positions the striatum at higher risk for disturbed interactions between two synaptic partners, neurons and astrocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Fura-4F acetoxymethyl ester, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM+), and 4-bromocalcimycin were from Invitrogen. Plasma membrane potential indicator (PMPI) (Component A from the R-8042 membrane potential assay kit) was from Molecular Devices Corp. (Sunnyvale, CA) (12Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14864-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Culture media and supplements were from Invitrogen unless otherwise stated. NMDA, (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK-801), ifenprodil, myxothiazol, oligomycin B, rotenone, carbonylcyanide-p-(trifluoromethoxyphenyl) hydrazone (FCCP), cyclosporin A, tacrolimus (FK506), thapsigargin, and other reagents were from Sigma.Cell Culture—Primary cultures were generated from the offspring of Wistar rats (CRIFFA, Barcelona, Spain). Handling and care of animals were conducted according to the European Union guidelines for animal research (86/609/EEC; in agreement with the National Institutes of Health guidelines) and Portuguese law (Portarias 1005/92 and 1131/97). Cortical and striatal cultures were prepared and maintained as previously described for striatal cultures (8Oliveira J.M. Chen S. Almeida S. Riley R. Goncalves J. Oliveira C.R. Hayden M.R.

Briefly, hemicortices (free from meninges, olfactory bulb, striatum, and hippocampus) and hemistriata were dissected from the same embryonic day 18 rats, pooled according to brain region (cortex or striatum), and processed in parallel (sister cultures). Dissociated cells (1 × 105) were plated in 12-mm round polyethyleneimine-coated glass coverslips and used in functional imaging experiments between 11 and 13 days in vitro (DIV).Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Blocking was performed with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for the neuronal marker (mouse anti-MAP-2 (microtubule-associated protein); Sigma; 1:500) and the astrocytic marker (rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); Dako; 1:250) in 3% bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to either AlexaFluor 488 or 594 (Invitrogen; 1:200) for 1 h at room temperature and shielded from light. Nuclei labeling was performed with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen; 2 μg/ml; 10 min at room temperature). To test for antibody selectivity, primary antibodies were omitted in control coverslips processed in parallel. No immunolabeling was observed in control coverslips, which were used for shading correction of epifluorescent images, acquired with the same equipment settings.Monitoring of Dynamic Changes in [Ca2+]i, Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm), and Plasma Membrane Potential (ΔΨp) in Single Cells—Functional imaging at single-cell resolution was performed with a system composed by an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Eclipse TE300, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with 20×, 40×, and 60× air objectives, a monochromator (Polychrome II; TILL Photonics, Martinsried, Germany), a CCD camera (C6790; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), and a computer with analysis software (Aquacosmos 2.5; Hamamatsu Photonics). Cells were loaded with the [Ca2+]i probe Fura-4F (5 μm) for 45 min at 37 °C. For simultaneous recordings of changes in [Ca2+]i and in TMRM+ fluorescence (indicative of changes in ΔΨm), 50 nm TMRM+ (quench mode) (14Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). was present during Fura-4F loading and throughout the experiments. Simultaneous recordings of changes in [Ca2+]i and in ΔΨp were performed in Fura-4F-loaded cells with a constant PMPI concentration present throughout the experiment. The PMPI concentration was the same as previously described (12Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14864-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), corresponding to a 1:2,000 dilution of a PMPI stock solution prepared by reconstituting one R-8042 Component A vial in 1 ml of ultrapure water. Experiments were performed at 37 °C in buffer containing 133 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2SO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, 1.3 mm CaCl2, and 15 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Where indicated, glucose was replaced by 2 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and mitochondria were energized with 10 mm pyruvate. Fura-4F was excited at 340 and 380 nm, TMRM+ at 550 nm, and PMPI at 500 nm. Dual Fura-4F and TMRM+ emission was collected with a 73100bs dichroic and a 73101 m emitter (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT), whereas dual Fura-4F and PMPI emission was collected with a 505-nm beam splitter and a 520-nm long pass filter. There was no significant bleed-through between Fura-4F and TMRM+ or between Fura-4F and PMPI with these excitation and emission settings. Individual cells were identified as regions of interest (ROIs) for the determination of fluorescence time courses.In situ calibration of Ca2+ responses for each individual cell was performed at the end of every experiment, according to previously detailed procedures (8Oliveira J.M. Chen S. Almeida S. Riley R. Goncalves J. Oliveira C.R. Hayden M.R. Nicholls D.G. Ellerby L.M. Rego A.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11174-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, maximal 340/380 ratios (Rmax) were determined with 20 μm 4-bromocalcimycin with 1.3 mm extracellular Ca2+, and minimal 340/380 ratios (Rmin) were determined in Ca2+-free buffer with 5 mm EGTA. This Ca2+-free buffer contained neither TMRM+ nor PMPI, and thus the subsequent decays in their respective fluorescence should not be interpreted as changes in ΔΨm or ΔΨp. In experiments addressing mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity, maximal mitochondrial depolarization (ΔΨm collapse) was confirmed/evoked before [Ca2+]i calibration by adding protonophore (1 μm FCCP), with ATP synthase reversal prevented by oligomycin (3 μm). Further details on the analysis of cellular responses are provided below.Image Processing and Data Analysis—Analysis of [Ca2+]i responses was performed as previously detailed (8Oliveira J.M. Chen S. Almeida S. Riley R. Goncalves J. Oliveira C.R. Hayden M.R. Nicholls D.G. Ellerby L.M. Rego A.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11174-11186Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, background-corrected 340/380 Fura-4F ratios were normalized to the Rmax (100 units) and Rmin (0 units) determined for each single cell during in situ calibration. The left yy axes of Ca2+ graphs are scaled with these normalized values, where 50 units should correspond to the Ca2+ probe Kd, regardless of its absolute value inside the different cells. The right yy axis is an approximate log [Ca2+]i scale adjusted based on the dynamic range of Fura-4F and Kd determinations (15Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR2002: 776-781Google Scholar, 16Wokosin D.L. Loughrey C.M. Smith G.L. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1726-1738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Changes in TMRM+ and PMPI fluorescence in single cells are expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units. Individual signals are corrected for epifluorescence shading, using images acquired in the same experimental xx-yy-zz plane, without TMRM+ (during Rmin determination at the end of the experiment) and in the absence of PMPI (before starting the experiment, in PMPI-free buffer). Exposure times for image acquisition were kept constant in all experiments, with signal saturation and underexposure being avoided merely by adjusting camera gain before starting the experiments. Mathematical correction for different gains was introduced so that all fluorescent signals are compared under the same circumstances.Conversions to mV of neuronal PMPI fluorescence (Figs. 1, B and D (ii), and 2, A (ii)) were performed in a manner similar to that described previously (12Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14864-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) but with in situ calibration for each individual neuron. Briefly, extracellular Na+ was replaced equimolarly by K+ in a stepwise fashion, up to 42 mm extracellular K+ in the assay buffer. ΔΨp values (in mV) were derived from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, assuming conductances for K+, Na+, and Cl- of 100:1:100. PMPI fluorescence enhancements evoked by K+ in each neuron were plotted in a function of ΔΨp and fit monoexponentially (correlation coefficients, r2 > 0.990) to generate individual calibration curves to derive approximate ΔΨp changes in mV.FIGURE 2Cultured cortical and striatal neurons are morphologically and functionally distinct. A, simultaneous monitoring of changes in [Ca2+]i (i) and ΔΨp (ii) in cortical and striatal neurons. NMDA (10 μm + 1 μm glycine), ifenprodil (IFEN; 2 μm), and MK-801 (5 μm) were added where indicated. Matched color lines in i and ii represent measurements performed in the same representative neuron (three are shown for each type). Time bar, 2 min. B, three-dimensional morphofunctional clustering of cortical (black circles) and striatal (white circles) neurons using the three parameters in xx, yy, and zz. Data are from a total of 46 (23 cortical and 23 striatal) neurons from single representative experiments with sister cultures. The solid lines converge to the respective centroid, and the vertical red dashed line divides neurons according to the blinded “two-step cluster analysis.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cell size was determined from the ROI area (μm2) using micrometer-calibrated images. Neuronal areas reflect only the soma, due to impossibility of tracing the entire neuronal processes. Area conversion into approximate somatic diameter (e.g. Fig. 2B) was performed by a circular approximation using Equation 1,d=2×SQRT(a/π)(Eq. 1) where d represents the diameter, SQRT is the square root, a is the area, and π is the circular constant.Mitochondrial concentration in single cells was estimated from the analysis of the average TMRM+ fluorescence in each ROI (for a representative measurement, see Fig. 3A (ii), solid line, γ - δ). The difference between resting TMRM+ fluorescence (start of experiment) and nonmitochondrial fluorescence (TMRM+ signal after FCCP, prior to Rmax determination; Figs. 3 and 4 (ii), solid lines) was assumed to reflect mitochondrial concentration. Our assumption is based on evidence that when the amount of TMRM+ stacked in the mitochondria surpasses the quench threshold, autoquenching occurs and fluorescence becomes invariant with matrix TMRM+ concentration (14Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); TMRM+ quenching in the present study is evidenced by the dequenching spikes in Fig. 4, A–D, ii, solid lines). Therefore, the resting cellular TMRM+ fluorescence in our experiments is primarily governed by the amount of mitochondria per cell volume (mitochondrial concentration) with superimposed nonmitochondrial fluorescence. This nonmitochondrial fluorescence reflects TMRM+ in extracellular buffer in the cytosol and non-specifically bound to cellular elements. Hence, subtracting the residual TMRM+ signal following full ΔΨm collapse (as confirmed with FCCP in the presence of oligomycin) should eliminate the vast majority of nonmitochondrial fluorescence, thus yielding an estimate of mitochondrial concentration. We further substantiate this procedure by providing both medium and high magnification images (supplemental material) of TMRM+-loaded neurons and astrocytes used in functional experiments. Collectively, the images show that the mitochondrial distribution is sparser in astrocytes that in neurons, visually showing a lower mitochondrial concentration. We also provide fluorescence intensity profiles across representative cells as well as time lapse experiments illustrating how ΔΨm collapse with oligomycin plus FCCP influences TMRM+ distribution and fluorescence intensity values in mitochondria-rich and mitochondria-free cellular regions.FIGURE 3In situ monitoring of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity in neurons and astrocytes from cortex and striatum. A–D, changes in [Ca2+]i (i) and in TMRM+ (ii; solid lines) or PMPI (ii; dashed lines) fluorescence in arbitrary units (A.F.U.). The solid or dashed line in i and ii depicts measurements performed simultaneously in the same single cell. Representative cells with identical [Ca2+]i kinetics were chosen (i) in order to allow comparison of changes in TMRM+ and PMPI fluorescence (ii). Assay buffer contained 10 mm pyruvate, and glucose was replaced by 2 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose before the addition of oligomycin (3 μm; O). FCCP addition (1 μm; F) confirms full ΔΨm collapse.

Oligomycin (O; 3 μm) and myxothiazol (M; 2 μm) were added where indicated.

This time variation results from the need to anticipate and avoid excessive Fura-4F leakage to allow accurate [Ca2+]i calibration. Assay buffer contained 10 mm pyruvate, and glucose was replaced by 2 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose before the addition of oligomycin (3 μm). A (i), Kexp, the rate of [Ca2+]i elevation. Up to 50 random single cells of each type were analyzed per experiment; only a few are shown for clarity, being representative of n = 5 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The rate of [Ca2+]i elevation was estimated by curve-fitting (with nonlinear regression) the normalized Fura-4F 340/380 ratios in experiments such as in Fig. 4, where the combination of oligomycin and a respiratory chain inhibitor (myxothiazol) collapsed ΔΨm, preventing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (17Nicholls D.G. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Best fit values, with r2 > 0.990, were obtained with Equation 2,y=IF(χlt;x0),THENy=b,ELSEy=b+(t - b)×(1 - e-Kexp×(x-x0)))(Eq. 2) where y represents normalized [Ca2+]i at time x, x0 is the first time point, b is basal [Ca2+]i, t is the top part of the curve (constrained to be below the 100 value achieved during Rmax), e is Neper's number, and Kexp is the exponential constant used to compare the rate of [Ca2+]i elevation among cells (e.g. Fig. 4A (i), Kexp arrow). It should be noted that myxothiazol, albeit at higher concentrations, was previously shown to inhibit Ca2+ influx through store-operated channels (18Makowska A. Zablocki K. Duszynski J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, 3 μm oligomycin (specifically oligomycin B, which has a 0.5 μm K50 for the inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ influx (19Cho J.H. Balasubramanyam M. Chernaya G. Gardner J.P. Aviv A.

J. 1997; 324: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) was present in our experiments either with or without myxothiazol, thus preventing differences in store-operated Ca2+ influx between these experiments.Image processing was performed with Aquacosmos 2.5 (Hamamatsu Photonics) and with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health; available on the World Wide Web). Calculations on numerical data derived from ROIs were automated in Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Values throughout are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Nonlinear regressions, curve fitting, and t tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (San Diego, CA). Other statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Type I error probability was set at 0.05 for all analyses.RESULTSCharacterization of Neurons and Astrocytes in Cortical and Striatal Cultures—Immunolabeling revealed that cortical and striatal cultures were predominantly composed of neurons and astrocytes (over 95% of all nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342 were also positive for either the neuronal marker, MAP-2, or the astrocytic marker, GFAP) (supplemental Fig. 1). At 11 DIV, cells were functionally differentiated. Neurons responded to K+ or NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation with [Ca2+]i elevation and plasma membrane depolarization in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and C, and solid lines in B and D). In contrast, astrocytes did not respond to NMDA (up to 100 μm), despite exhibiting changes in plasma membrane polarization upon K+ challenging. Also, no changes in astrocytic [Ca2+]i were detected during either K+ or NMDA challenging, despite clear responses to Ca2+-ionophore during [Ca2+]i calibration (Rmax; Fig. 1, A and C, and dashed lines in B and D). These clear functional differences ensured cellular identification, particularly in experiments with PMPI (e.g. Fig. 1, A and C (ii), bottom left; Fig. 3, A and B (ii), dashed lines).To appraise differences between cortical and striatal neurons, we integrated three parameters (somatic diameter, NMDA pEC50, and proportion of functional NMDAR-2B) in a cluster analysis with n = 23 random neurons of each type. The average somatic diameter was larger for cortical neurons (17.4 ± 0.4 versus 12.9 ± 0.2 μm; p < 0.001).

https://openalex.org/W2072635298,"Pavlovian conditioning is one of the major neurobiological mechanisms of placebo effects, potentially influencing the course of specific diseases and the response to a pharmacological therapy, such as immunosuppression. In our study with behaviorally conditioned rats, a relevant taste (0.2% saccharin) preceded the application of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA), a specific calcineurin (CaN) inhibitor. Our results demonstrate that through pavlovian conditioning the particular pharmacological properties of CsA can be transferred to a neutral taste, i.e., CaN activity was inhibited in splenocytes from conditioned rats after reexposure to the gustatory stimulus. Concomitant immune consequences were observed on ex vivo mitogenic challenge (anti-CD3). Particularly, Th1-cytokine, but not Th2-cytokine, production and cell proliferation were impeded. Appropriate pharmacological and behavioral controls certify that all these changes in T-lymphocyte reactivity are attributable to mere taste reexposure. Furthermore, the underlying sympathetic-lymphocyte interaction was revealed modeling the conditioned response in vitro. CaN activity in CD4(+) T lymphocytes is reduced by beta-adrenergic stimulation (terbutaline), with these effects antagonized by the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist nadolol. In summary, CaN was identified as the intracellular target for inducing conditioned immunosuppression by CsA, contributing to our understanding of the intracellular mechanisms behind ""learned placebo effects."""
https://openalex.org/W2071698123,"Collagen type V/XI is a minor but essential component of collagen fibrils in vertebrates. We here report on age- and tissue-related variations in isoform usage in cartilages. With maturation of articular cartilage, the alpha1(V) chain progressively replaced the alpha2(XI) chain. A mix of the molecular isoforms, alpha1(XI)alpha1(V)alpha3(XI) and alpha1(XI)alpha2(XI)alpha3(XI), best explained this finding. A prominence of alpha1(V) chains is therefore characteristic and a potential biomarker of mature mammalian articular cartilage. Analysis of cross-linked peptides showed that the alpha1(V) chains were primarily cross-linked to alpha1(XI) chains in the tissue and hence an integral component of the V/XI polymer. From nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc (in which the bulk collagen monomer is type II as in articular cartilage), type V/XI collagen consisted of a mix of five genetically distinct chains, alpha1(XI), alpha2(XI), alpha3(XI), alpha1(V), and alpha2(V). These presumably were derived from several different molecular isoforms, including alpha1(XI)alpha2(XI)alpha3(XI), (alpha1(XI))(2)alpha2(V), and others. Meniscal fibrocartilage shows yet another V/XI phenotype. The findings support and extend the concept that the clade B subfamily of COL5 and COL11 gene products should be considered members of the same collagen subfamily, from which, in combination with clade A gene products (COL2A1 or COL5A2), a range of molecular isoforms has evolved into tissue-dependent usage. We propose an evolving role for collagen V/XI isoforms as an adaptable polymeric template of fibril macro-architecture."
https://openalex.org/W1970611142,"The architecture of parallel fiber axons contacting cerebellar Purkinje neurons retains spatial information over long distances. Parallel fiber synapses can trigger local dendritic calcium spikes, but whether and how this calcium signal leads to plastic changes that decode the parallel fiber input organization is unknown. By combining voltage and calcium imaging, we show that calcium signals, elicited by parallel fiber stimulation and mediated by voltage-gated calcium channels, increase non-linearly during high-frequency bursts of electrically constant calcium spikes, because they locally and transiently saturate the endogenous buffer. We demonstrate that these non-linear calcium signals, independently of NMDA or metabotropic glutamate receptor activation, can induce parallel fiber long-term potentiation. Two-photon imaging in coronal slices revealed that calcium signals inducing long-term potentiation can be observed by stimulating either the parallel fiber or the ascending fiber pathway. We propose that local dendritic calcium spikes, evoked by synaptic potentials, provide a unique mechanism to spatially decode parallel fiber signals into cerebellar circuitry changes."
https://openalex.org/W2039692456,"Different lines of evidence indicate that both aberrant activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival pathway and down-regulation of the death mediator ceramide play a critical role in the aggressive behavior, apoptosis resistance, and adverse clinical outcome of glioblastoma multiforme. Furthermore, the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the up-regulation of ceramide have been found functional to the activity of many cytotoxic treatments against glioma cell lines and glioblastomas as well. A reciprocal control between PI3K/Akt and ceramide signaling in glioma cell survival/death is suggested by data demonstrating a protective role of PI3K/Akt on ceramide-induced cell death in glial cells. In this study we investigated the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the regulation of the ceramide metabolism in C6 glioma cells, a cell line in which the PI3K/Akt pathway is constitutively activated. Metabolic experiments performed with different radioactive metabolic precursors of sphingolipids and microscopy studies with fluorescent ceramides demonstrated that the chemical inhibition of PI3K and the transfection with a dominant negative Akt strongly inhibited ceramide utilization for the biosynthesis of complex sphingolipids by controlling the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi vesicular transport of ceramide. These findings constitute the first evidence for a PI3K/Akt-dependent regulation of vesicle-mediated movements of ceramide in the ER-Golgi district. Moreover, the findings also suggest the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway as crucial to coordinate the biosynthesis of membrane complex sphingolipids with cell proliferation and growth and/or to maintain low ceramide levels, especially as concerns those treatments that promote ceramide biosynthesis in the ER.

Metabolic experiments performed with different radioactive metabolic precursors of sphingolipids and microscopy studies with fluorescent ceramides demonstrated that the chemical inhibition of PI3K and the transfection with a dominant negative Akt strongly inhibited ceramide utilization for the biosynthesis of complex sphingolipids by controlling the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi vesicular transport of ceramide. These findings constitute the first evidence for a PI3K/Akt-dependent regulation of vesicle-mediated movements of ceramide in the ER-Golgi district. Moreover, the findings also suggest the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway as crucial to coordinate the biosynthesis of membrane complex sphingolipids with cell proliferation and growth and/or to maintain low ceramide levels, especially as concerns those treatments that promote ceramide biosynthesis in the ER. Gliomas are the most frequent brain tumors derived from the transformation of glial cells or their precursors (1Singh S.K. Hawkins C. Clarke I.D. Squire J.A. Bayani J. Hide T. Henkelman R.M.

There is a poor prognosis for patients with GBM, the median survival being 9–12 months, and this does not significantly improve even after aggressive treatment with multiple approaches, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (5Davis F.G. McCarthy B.J. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2001; 1: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This poor survival rate seems to be mainly due to the marked invasiveness and proliferation of GBM, as well as to their apoptotic resistance and aberrant angiogenesis. These malignancy features could be related to the varying mutations frequently found in GBM tumors that impact different key pathways involved in the control of cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, and DNA repair (6Rao R.D.

PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3′-hydroxyl group of phosphatidylinositol and phosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol(4,5)P2 (PIP2), which is converted to phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3). The activation of PI3Ks can occur through growth factor receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and oncogenes such as Ras. The generated polyphosphoinositides bind to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of different proteins, including PDK1 (3′-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1) and the serine/threonine kinase Akt, thus facilitating the interaction between the two proteins and the activation of Akt by PDK1. Cell levels of phosphoinositides are controlled not only by PI3K but also by the tumor suppressor PTEN. which is a PIP3 phosphatase. PTEN negatively regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway by converting PIP3 back to PIP2. The activation of Akt promotes cell growth and survival and inhibition of apoptosis and also regulates glucose and lipid metabolism at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels; furthermore, Akt activation can exert some control over cell movement and vesicle trafficking within cells (13Engelman J.A. Luo J. Cantley L.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 606-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). The overexpression or the mutation of PI3K-related genes and the deletion or mutation of PTEN have been reported in many GBMs and glioblastoma-derived cell lines (12Knobbe C.B. Merlo A.

Indeed, all the above-mentioned conditions determine high basal levels of PIPs and Akt activation, even in the absence of growth factor stimulation. In GBMs, reduced levels of PTEN and increased Akt activity have been correlated with more aggressive tumor behavior and reduced survival time in patients (19Ermoian R.P. Furniss C.S. Lamborn K.R.

The aberrant activation of PI3K-Akt-PTEN signaling has been identified as crucial to the malignant features of GBMs, such as rapid tumor growth, invasiveness, resistance to cytotoxic treatments, and massive neovascularization (12Knobbe C.B.

Indeed, in GBMs, the possibility of disregulation in Cer-dependent signaling is strongly supported by the evidence of an inverse association between Cer levels and GBM malignancy progression, and the direct correlation of such levels with patient survival (25Riboni L.

The A-SMase incubation mixture contained 200 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 μm [14C]SM (0.1 μCi), and 2–10 μg of cell protein in a final volume of 25 μl. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume) at 4 °C; the radioactivity associated with the aqueous phase represented by [14C]phosphocholine was measured.Analysis of the Intracellular Distribution of Fluorescent Ceramides—C6 glioma cells or stable transfectants for DN-AKT and vector were plated at 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2 and grown on a glass coverslip for 48 h in DMEM plus 10% FCS. The cells were then loaded with 5 μm BODIPY-C5-Cer or NBD-C6-Cer (1:1 complex with fatty acid free BSA) as described previously (43Giussani P. Colleoni T. Brioschi L. Bassi R. Hanada K. Tettamanti G. Riboni L. Viani P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 40-51PubMed Google Scholar). After loading, the cells were incubated 30 min at 37 °C in DMEM plus 10% FCS with or without 0.5 μm Wm or 20 μm LY294002 or 20 μm LY303511. The cells were then washed (three times with PBS) and fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde solution in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. The specimens were immediately observed and analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX-50), as described above.Other Methods—Total protein amount was assayed with the Coomassie Blue-based reagent (Pierce), using BSA fraction V as standard. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Statistical significance of differences was determined by the Student's t test.RESULTSEffect of PI3K/Akt on [3H]Sph Metabolism—To investigate the effect of PI3K/Akt on Cer metabolism in C6 glioma cells, we first utilized the chemical inhibition of PI3K. As the commonly used PI3K inhibitors Wm and LY294002 can also inhibit type III PI4Ks, although at higher doses (45Balla A. Balla T. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that PI4KIIIβ plays a role in CERT-mediated Cer metabolism (46Toth B.

Chem. 2006; 281: 36369-36377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we initially set up working concentrations to specifically inhibit PI3K. To do this we evaluated the effect of different concentrations of Wm and LY294002 on PI4K activity by staining cells with the EGFP-FAPP1-PH domain, which specifically interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) (47Godi A. Di Campli A. Konstantakopoulos A. Di Tullio G. Alessi D.R. Kular G.S. Daniele T. Marra P. Lucocq J.M. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the EGFP-FAPP1-PH domain in the control cells is almost exclusively present in the perinuclear region, representative of the Golgi complex, supporting the preferential localization of PI4P in this subcellular compartment (48Cockcroft S.

https://openalex.org/W2057122292,"The 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (GPCR) and plays a key role in transducing a variety of cellular signals elicited by 5-hydroxytryptamine in both peripheral and central tissues. Despite its broad physiological importance, our current understanding of 5-HT2A receptor regulation is incomplete. We recently reported the novel finding that the multifunctional ERK effector ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) physically interacts with the 5-HT2A receptor third intracellular (i3) loop and modulates receptor signaling (Sheffler, D.

We report here that RSK2 directly phosphorylates the 5-HT2A receptor i3 loop at the conserved residue Ser-314, thereby modulating 5-HT2A receptor signaling. Furthermore, these studies led to the discovery that RSK2 is required for epidermal growth factor-mediated heterologous desensitization of the 5-HT2A receptor. We arrived at these conclusions via multiple lines of evidence, including in vitro kinase experiments, tandem mass spectrometry, and site-directed mutagenesis. Our findings were further validated using phospho-specific Western blot analysis, metabolic labeling studies, and whole-cell signaling experiments. These results support a novel regulatory mechanism in which a downstream effector of the ERK/MAPK pathway directly interacts with, phosphorylates, and modulates signaling of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor. To our knowledge, these findings are the first to demonstrate that a downstream member of the ERK/MAPK cascade phosphorylates a GPCR as well as mediates cross-talk between a growth factor and a GPCR.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11934-11939Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Moreover, dysregulation of the 5-HT2A receptor has been linked to the etiology of several psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia, thus highlighting the importance of gaining a more thorough understanding of the precise regulation of 5-HT2A receptors (7Roth B.L. Ann. Clin. Psychiatry. 1994; 6: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).The 5-HT2A receptor belongs to the GPCR superfamily that encompasses molecular targets for an extreme diversity of endogenous and exogenous ligands that are essential for nearly every physiological process (8Kroeze W.K. Sheffler D.J. Roth B.L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4867-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Extensive studies focusing on the G protein-coupled receptor kinase-arrestin pathway and the second messenger-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C (PKC)) pathways suggest that direct GPCR phosphorylation remains the predominant mechanism for rapidly attenuating the signaling of many GPCRs (9Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 10Kelly E. Bailey C.P. Henderson G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Additional kinases have also been shown to phosphorylate GPCRs, and it is likely that many yet to be discovered kinases regulate GPCR signaling (11Tobin A.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 153: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Several studies have demonstrated that PKC modulates 5-HT2A receptor signaling in vivo and in vitro. Our early studies (12Roth B.L. Nakaki T. Chuang D.M. Costa E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 238: 480-485PubMed Google Scholar) showed that activation of PKC by phorbol dibutyrate inhibited 5-HT2A-mediated signaling. Many subsequent studies in a variety of cellular contexts have replicated these observations (13Rahimian R. Hrdina P.D. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 1686-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Rahman S. McLean J.H. Darby-King A. Paterno G. Reynolds J.N. Neuman R.S.

In addition to PKC, recent reports suggest that calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2/3 regulate 5-HT2A signaling (18Berg K.A. Stout B.D. Maayani S. Clarke W.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 593-602PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hanley N.R. Hensler J.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although the role of G protein-coupled receptor kinases is cell-specific (20Gray J.A. Sheffler D.J. Bhatnagar A. Woods J.A. Hufeisen S.J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). From these prior studies it is clear that selected kinases modulate 5-HT2A receptor function, although the site(s) of action and their mechanisms remain unknown.Recently we discovered that RSK2, a downstream effector of the ERK/MAPK pathway, regulates the signaling of several GPCRs, including 5-HT2A, P2Y-purinergic, PAR-1-thrombinergic, β1-adrenergic receptor, and bradykinin-B receptors (21Sheffler D.J. Kroeze W.K. Garcia B.G. Deutch A.Y. Hufeisen S.J. Leahy P. Bruning J.C. Roth B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4717-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RSK2 is a well characterized member of the RSK family of multifunctional ERK effectors (RSK1–4), and RSK2 has been shown to phosphorylate a wide variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (22Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). We (21Sheffler D.J. Kroeze W.K. Garcia B.G. Deutch A.Y. Hufeisen S.J. Leahy P. Bruning J.C. Roth B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4717-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) recently showed that RSK2 interacts with the 5-HT2A i3 loop within a conserved region containing an RSK2-like consensus phosphorylation motif (275RAKLAS280) (23Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Importantly, RSK2 modulated 5-HT2A receptor signaling independent of changes in 5-HT2A receptor subcellular distribution, global G protein function, and without altering the expression of any genes known to be involved in serotonergic signal transduction. Our findings implied that RSK2 acts proximal to receptor activation, at the level of receptor-G protein coupling, perhaps via direct phosphorylation of 5-HT2A receptors.Here we provide multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that activated RSK2 phosphorylates the 5-HT2A receptor i3 loop at the conserved residue Ser-314. We show that mutation of Ser-314 renders the 5-HT2A receptor insensitive to RSK2 regulation, thereby resulting in increased signaling mirroring observations in RSK2–/– fibroblasts (21Sheffler D.J. Kroeze W.K. Garcia B.G. Deutch A.Y. Hufeisen S.J. Leahy P. Bruning J.C. Roth B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4717-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To our knowledge this is the first report that a downstream member of the ERK/MAPK cascade phosphorylates a GPCR. Moreover, these studies uncovered a novel regulatory mechanism whereby RSK2 is required for EGF-mediated heterologous desensitization of the 5-HT2A receptor. These data support the intriguing notion that 5-HT2A receptor responsiveness in cells is influenced by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation.Because null mutations of RSK2 lead to Coffin-Lowry syndrome, which is characterized by mental retardation, cardiovascular disorders, and a schizophrenia-like psychosis (24Hanauer A. Young I.D. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 39: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), these findings may explain, in part, some of the clinical manifestations of this syndrome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture reagents were supplied by Invitrogen and Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and the RSK2+/+ and RSK2–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts were generated as described previously (25Bruning J.C.

The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and horse anti-goat secondary antibodies were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA).Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293T and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified environment in the presence of 5% CO2. FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) was used exactly as described by the manufacturer to transiently transfect subconfluent HEK 293T cells cultured in 10-cm dishes. Cells were used within 72 h of transfection.RSK2 Constructs—The native mouse RSK2 cDNA was subcloned from pMT2-HA-RSK2 (26Zhao Y. Bjorbaek C. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) introducing 5′HindIII and 3′KpnI sites using the following primers: AAAAAAGCTTTAGCCACCATGCCGCTGGCGCAGCTG (HindIII in boldface type) and ACCTCAACAGCCCTGTGAGGTACCTTTT (KpnI in boldface type). For virus production the RSK2 sequence was subsequently modified by site-directed mutagenesis to remove an internal EcoRI site and subcloned into the pBABE retroviral vector containing a puromycin resistance gene (pBABEpuro) (27Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The primers were as follows: AAAAGAATTCGCCACCAGCCGCTGGCG (EcoRI in boldface type) and AAAAGTCGACTCACAGGGCTGTTGAGGTG (SalI in boldface type). Kinase-dead RSK2 mutants in pcDNA3 and pEGFP-C1 were generated as outlined below.Affinity-tagged 5-HT2A Receptor Construction—The 5-HT2A receptor containing an N-terminal Hemophilus influenzae hemagglutinin membrane insertion signal sequence and contiguous FLAG and hexahistidine affinity tags (FLAG-His6 5-HT2A) was constructed using the rat FLAG 5-HT2A receptor (28Xia Z. Gray J.A. Compton-Toth B.A. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) as a template for overlap extension PCR. Briefly, two amplicons inserting 5′ EcoRI (amplicon 1) and 3′ SalI (amplicon 2) restriction sites as well as an overlapping hexahistidine affinity tag sequence were generated. Amplicon 1 was generated with the following primers: AAAGAATTCGCCACCATGAAGACGATCAT (EcoRI in boldface type) and GATGTGATGATGATGATGATGCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTG (hexahistidine sequence in boldface type). Amplicon 2 was generated with the following primers: CATCATCATCATCATCACATCGAGGGCCGCG (hexahistidine sequence in boldface type) and AAAGTCGACTCACACACAGCTAACCTTTTCATTC (SalI in boldface type). The amplicons were annealed and extended to produce the full-length FLAG-His6 5-HT2A product. The FLAG-His6 5-HT2A cDNA was subcloned into the pBABEpuro retroviral vector for stable line generation using the EcoRI and SalI amplicon primers. The phosphorylation-deficient mutant (S314A) in pBABEpuro was mutagenized as outlined below. The FLAG-His6 5-HT2A receptor insert in pBABEpuro was subcloned into pcDNA3 for receptor purification using the following primers: AAAAAGCTTACCACCATGAAGAC (HindIII in boldface type) and AAATCTAGATCACACACAGCTAACCTTTTCATTC (XbaI highlighted). Each FLAG-His6 5-HT2A receptor construct was confirmed by automated sequencing (Genome Analysis Facility, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) and alignment of the overlapping sequences in Vector NTi (Invitrogen).Construction and Tandem Affinity Purification of I3 Loop Peptides—The i3 loop peptide (amino acids 252–328 of the rat 5-HT2A receptor) was purified similarly to a previous report (29Gelber E.I. Kroeze W.K. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Sinar C.A. Hyde E.G. Gurevich V. Benovic J. Roth B.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This purification scheme yielded a final 79-amino acid peptide (8772 Da) containing an extra N-terminal Met and extra C-terminal Gly. Briefly, the i3 loop peptide was subcloned (introducing 5′ NdeI and 3′ NheI) into the inducible pET11a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) as a fusion protein located N-terminal to an inducible protein splicing element (intein) attached to a modified chitin binding domain containing a C-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag (IMPACT, New England Biolabs, Inc.). Phosphorylation-deficient mutants were constructed as outlined below. BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were freshly transformed with i3 loop peptide constructs in pET11a, grown to A600 nm = 0.6 in LB medium containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 25 °C. The E. coli were collected, washed, and frozen at –20 °C. The frozen pellets were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) and passed three times through a French press at 1500 p.s.i., and the supernatant was isolated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), washed with 7-bed volumes of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and the fusion protein recovered with 3 bed volumes of elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Fractions containing the 60-kDa fusion protein, as determined by Western blot analysis, were pooled and applied to a chitin column (New England Biolabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA). The chitin column was washed with 7 bed volumes of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, pH 8.0) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with intein cleavage buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0). The i3 loop peptide was recovered with 3 bed volumes of elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and each fraction was analyzed by Western blot. Fractions containing the liberated i3 loop peptide (apparent molecular mass of 6 kDa) were combined and further purified and concentrated using 30- and 3-kDa Centricon filter units (Millipore, Billerica, MA), respectively. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar), and peptides were frozen at –80 °C until further use.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate kinase-dead RSK2 mutants, i3 loop peptide mutants, and a full-length FLAG-His6 5-HT2A receptor mutant using the wild-type constructs as PCR templates. The following primers were used to generate kinase-dead RSK2 mutants (mutated codon in boldface type): 1) K100A, GCTAGACAGCTTTATGCCATGGCAGTATTAAAGAAGGCCAC and GTGGCCTTCTTTAATACTGCCATGGCATAAAGCTGTCTAGC; 2) K451A, CAAACATGGAGTTTGCCGTGGCGATTATTGATAAAAGCAAGAGAG and CTCTCTTGCTTTTATCAATAATCGCCACGGCAAACTCCATGTTTG. The S280A i3 loop peptide mutant in pET11a was generated using mutagenesis primers ACTCGAGCCAAACTAGCCGCCTTCAGCTTCCTCCCTCAG and CTGAGGGAGGAAGCTGAAGGCGGCTAGTTTGGCTCGAGT. The phosphorylation-deficient S314A i3 loop peptide and receptor mutants were both generated using the mutagenesis primers GGCCGAAGGACGATGCAGGCCATCAGCAATGAGCAAAAG and CTTTTGCTCATTGCTGATGGCCTGCATCGTCCTTCGGCC. All constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing (Genomics Core Facility, Cleveland, OH, and Genome Analysis Facility, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) and alignment of the overlapping sequences in Vector NTi (Invitrogen).Retrovirus Production and 5-HT2A Polyclonal Stable Line Generation—Amphotropic retrovirus was produced from helper virus-free HEK 293 (HEK 293TS) host cells using the pBABEpuro retroviral vector and pCL10A1 amphotropic packaging plasmid (Imgenex, San Diego). Briefly, HEK 293TS cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of RSK2 or receptor cDNA and 3 μg of pCL10A1. Viral supernatants were collected 24–36 h post-transfection, combined with Polybrene (8 μg/ml), and added to RSK2–/– and RSK2+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts previously used to identify RSK2 as a modulator of 5-HT2A receptor signaling (21Sheffler D.J. Kroeze W.K. Garcia B.G. Deutch A.Y. Hufeisen S.J. Leahy P. Bruning J.C. Roth B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4717-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Polyclonal cell populations were selected with puromycin (3–4 μg/ml) 48 h after infection. Polyclonal populations of fibroblasts expressing wild-type 5-HT2A and 5-HT2A-S314A receptors were expanded and characterized for receptor expression using radioligand binding as described previously (20Gray J.A.

Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar) was used to calculate affinity (Kd) and receptor density (Bmax) values from homologous competition curves (see “Results”). For IP time course and EGF desensitization studies, we used previously generated RSK2+/+ and RSK2–/– fibroblasts stably expressing similar amounts of 5-HT2A receptors (21Sheffler D.J. Kroeze W.K. Garcia B.G. Deutch A.Y. Hufeisen S.J. Leahy P. Bruning J.C. Roth B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cell pellets were solubilized with cold lysis buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% CHAPS, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.5) at a concentration of 10 ml/g cell pellet for 20 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was added to EZ-view M2 FLAG affinity resin and rocked for 2 h at 4 °C. The M2 FLAG resin was washed twice with 10 volumes of lysis buffer A and once with 10 volumes of lysis buffer B (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% CHAPS, EDTA-free protease inhibitors, pH 7.5). The receptors were eluted from the M2 FLAG resin with 200 μm 1× FLAG peptide, supplemented to 10 mm imidazole, and added to Ni-NTA resin. The Ni-NTA resin was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation and washed four times with 10 volumes of wash buffer (lysis buffer B + 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5). The FLAG-His6 5-HT2A receptor was eluted from the Ni-NTA resin with elution buffer (lysis buffer B + 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.5) and stored at –80 °C. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK-293 cells were transiently co-transfected with FLAG-5-HT2A and cyan fluorescent protein, FLAG-5-HT2A and RSK2-GFP, FLAG-5-HT2A and RSK2-K100A-GFP, or FLAG-5-HT2A and RSK2-K451A-GFP cDNA. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (28Xia Z. Gray J.A. Compton-Toth B.A. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of RSK2 and detection of Ser(P)-386 was performed following 18 h of serum starvation as described previously (32Cohen M.S. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Taunton J. Science. 2005; 308: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting and Antibody Generation—Purified i3 loop peptides and 5-HT2A receptors were immunoblotted using standard procedures (20Gray J.A. Sheffler D.J. Bhatnagar A. Woods J.A. Hufeisen S.J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), except for phospho-specific immunoblots that were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Specifically, i3 loop peptides were resolved on 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with the i3 loop antibody (antibody 1A, 1:3000) targeting amino acids 280–295 of the rat 5-HT2A receptor (29Gelber E.I. Kroeze W.K. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Sinar C.A. Hyde E.G. Gurevich V. Benovic J. Roth B.L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 5-HT2A receptors were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with the FLAG antibody (1:1000), an antibody directed against the rat 5-HT2A C terminus (5-HT2A-CT Ab, 1:1000), or the phospho-Ser-314-specific antibody (Ser(P)-314 Ab, 1:2000). The C-terminal Ab was generated similarly as indicated in a previous report (33Backstrom J.R. Sanders-Bush E. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 77: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, two New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with the synthetic peptide 428QKKNSQEDAEQTVDDC443 conjugated to BSA in Freund's complete adjuvant (Invitrogen). Bleeds were screened for selectivity using concentrated rat 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. Serum from the first extension bleed selectively detected the 5-HT2A receptor, which was blocked by preincubation with the antigenic peptide. The Ser(P)-314 Ab was generated against a synthetic phosphopeptide 307AGRRTMQS(PO3)ISNEQKAC322 (Biomer Technology, Hayward, CA). Two New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with the phosphopeptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in Freund's complete adjuvant, and bleeds were characterized against both the unmodified peptide and the phosphopeptide. Serum from the second bleed selectively detected <10 ng of the phosphopeptide. RSK2 (1:1000) was detected as described previously (21Sheffler D.J. Kroeze W.K. Garcia B.G. Deutch A.Y. Hufeisen S.J. Leahy P. Bruning J.C. Roth B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4717-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were quantified using Kodak Imaging software (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, CT).In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro kinase assays included the following: 1) purified, activated RSK2 (Upstate-Millipore, Billerica, MA) diluted in enzyme buffer (20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Brij-35, 5% glycerol, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.5); 2) i3 loop peptide or FLAG-His6 5-HT2A receptor substrates; and 3) [γ-32P]ATP or unlabeled ATP diluted in assay buffer (75 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2). We assayed for [32P]phosphate incorporation by incubating purified i3 loop peptide or purified FLAG-His6 5-HT2A receptor with 0.4–0.8 ng/μl RSK2 in the presence of 0.4–0.04 μCi/μl[γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by heating the samples for 5 min at 65 °C in SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 4–20% gradient (Invitrogen) or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and imaged on a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and analyzed using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Kinetic measurements were performed under initial velocity conditions determined from a pilot experiment showing linear incorporation of [32P]phosphate into the i3 loop peptide over 30 min using 0.4 ng/μl RSK2. Briefly, seven concentrations (2.3–140 μm) of i3 loop peptide were incubated with RSK2 in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled ATP and 0.04 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (7000 cpm/pmol ATP"
https://openalex.org/W1972423919,"Borrelia lusitaniae is an Old World species of the Lyme borreliosis (LB) group of tick-borne spirochetes and prevails mainly in countries around the Mediterranean Basin. Lizards of the family Lacertidae have been identified as reservoir hosts of B. lusitaniae. These reptiles are highly structured geographically, indicating limited migration. In order to examine whether host geographic structure shapes the evolution and epidemiology of B. lusitaniae, we analyzed the phylogeographic population structure of this tick-borne bacterium using a recently developed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on chromosomal housekeeping genes. A total of 2,099 questing nymphal and adult Ixodes ricinus ticks were collected in two climatically different regions of Portugal, being ∼130 km apart. All ticks were screened for spirochetes by direct PCR. Attempts to isolate strains yielded 16 cultures of B. lusitaniae in total. Uncontaminated cultures as well as infected ticks were included in this study. The results using MLST show that the regional B. lusitaniae populations constitute genetically distinct populations. In contrast, no clear phylogeographic signals were detected in sequences of the commonly used molecular markers ospA and ospC. The pronounced population structure of B. lusitaniae over a short geographic distance as captured by MLST of the housekeeping genes suggests that the migration rates of B. lusitaniae are rather low, most likely because the distribution of mediterranean lizard populations is highly parapatric. The study underlines the importance of vertebrate hosts in the geographic spread of tick-borne microparasites."
https://openalex.org/W2050918910,"Normal pH sensitivity of the SLC4A2/AE2 anion exchanger requires transmembrane domain (TMD) amino acid (aa) residues not conserved in the homologous but relatively pH-insensitive SLC4A1/AE1 polypeptide. We tested the hypothesis that the nonconserved aa cluster 1075DKPK1078 within the first putative re-entrant loop (RL1) of AE2 TMD contributes to pH sensor function by studying anion exchange function of AE2 mutants in which these and other RL1 aa were systematically substituted with corresponding RL1 aa from AE1. Regulation of Cl-/Cl- and Cl-/HCO(-)3 exchange by intracellular pH (pHi) or extracellular pH (pHo) was measured as 4,4'-di-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2' disulfonic acid-sensitive 36Cl- efflux from Xenopus oocytes. AE2 RL1 mutants 1075AAAQ1078 and 1075AAAQN1079 showed reduced pHi sensitivity and pHo sensitivity was acid-shifted by approximately 1 pH unit. Individual mutants D1075A and P1077A exhibited moderately altered pH sensitivity, whereas a range of substitutions at conserved AE2 Ile-1079 substantially altered sensitivity to pHo and/or pHi. Substitution of the complete AE1 RL1 with AE2 RL1 failed to confer AE2-like pH sensitivity onto AE1. Replacement, however, of AE1 RL1 763SGPGAAAQ770 with AE2 1071VAPGDKPK1078 restored pHi sensitivity to the chimera AE2(1-920)/AE1(613-929) without affecting its low sensitivity to pHo. The results show that acute regulation of AE2 by pH requires RL1 of the TMD. We propose that critical segments of RL1 constitute part of an AE2 pH sensor that, together with residues within the N-terminal half of the TMD, constrain the AE2 polypeptide in a conformation required for regulation of anion exchange by pHi."
https://openalex.org/W2056101321,"A novel fibronectin-binding protein from Pasteurella multocida (PM1665) that binds to the fibronectin type III9-10 modules via two helix-hairpin-helix motifs has recently been described [1]. This protein shares homology with competence-related DNA-binding and uptake proteins (ComEA and ComE) from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we show that recombinant PM1665 (now designated ComE1) also binds to DNA through the same helix-hairpin-helix motifs required for fibronectin-binding. This binding to DNA is non sequence-specific and is confined to double-stranded DNA. We have cloned and expressed ComE1 proteins from five members of the Pasteurellaceae in order to further investigate the function(s) of these proteins. When expressed as recombinant GST-fusion proteins, all of the homologues bound both to fibronectin and to double-stranded DNA. Inactivation of the gene encoding the ComE1 homologue in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae indicates major roles for these proteins in at least two processes: natural transformation, and binding of bacteria to fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W2065410692,"A variety of forensic, population, and disease studies are based on haploid DNA (e.g. mitochondrial DNA or Y-chromosome data). For any set of genetic markers databases of conventional size will normally contain only a fraction of all haplotypes. For several applications, reliable estimates of haplotype frequencies, the total number of haplotypes and coverage of the database (the probability that the next random haplotype is contained in the database) will be useful. We propose different approaches to the problem based on classical methods as well as new applications of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We also discuss previous proposals based on saturation curves. Several conclusions can be inferred from simulated and real data. First, classical estimates of the fraction of unseen haplotypes can be seriously biased. Second, there is no obvious way to decide on required sample size based on traditional approaches. Methods based on testing of hypotheses or length of confidence intervals may appear artificial since no single test or parameter stands out as particularly relevant. Rather the coverage may be more relevant since it indicates the percentage of different haplotypes that are contained in a database; if the coverage is low, there is a considerable chance that the next haplotype to be observed does not appear in the database and this indicates that the database needs to be expanded. Finally, freeware and example data sets accompany the methods discussed in this paper: http://folk.uio.no/thoree/nhap/."
https://openalex.org/W2102174700,"Interventionist conservation management of territorial large carnivores has increased in recent years, especially in South Africa. Understanding of spatial ecology is an important component of predator conservation and management. Spatial patterns are influenced by many, often interacting, factors making elucidation of key drivers difficult. We had the opportunity to study a simplified system, a single pride of lions (Panthera leo) after reintroduction onto the 85 km2 Karongwe Game Reserve, from 1999–2005, using radio-telemetry. In 2002 one male was removed from the paired coalition which had been present for the first three years. A second pride and male were in a fenced reserve adjacent of them to the east. This made it possible to separate social and resource factors in both a coalition and single male scenario, and the driving factors these seem to have on spatial ecology. Male ranging behaviour was not affected by coalition size, being driven more by resource rather than social factors. The females responded to the lions on the adjacent reserve by avoiding the area closest to them, therefore females may be more driven by social factors. Home range size and the resource response to water are important factors to consider when reintroducing lions to a small reserve, and it is hoped that these findings lead to other similar studies which will contribute to sound decisions regarding the management of lions on small reserves."
https://openalex.org/W1970099695,"Neurotransmitters are concentrated into synaptic vesicles by VGLUT (vesicular glutamate transporter) or VGAT (vesicular GABA transporter). The number of VGLUTs per vesicle determines the amount of stored neurotransmitter, thereby influencing postsynaptic response. Recently, we described a strong diurnal cycling of the amount of VGLUT1 on synaptic vesicles prepared from whole mouse brain at different times of the day (Yelamanchili, S. V., Pendyala, G., Brunk, I., Darna, M., Albrecht, U., and Ahnert-Hilger, G. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 15671–15679). To analyze whether and how much VGLUT resides in cellular versus vesicular membranes, we developed a Pronase assay. We found that VGLUT and synaptotagmin are highly accessible to proteolytic cleavage in rat and mouse synaptosomal preparations, indicating considerable amounts of these vesicular proteins at the plasma membrane, whereas only minor amounts of synaptophysin and Rab3 are digested. Sucrose stimulation increases digestion of VGLUT, synaptotagmin, and synaptophysin due to membrane fusion that exposes the lumen-facing peptides to the extracellular space. Digestion of mouse synaptosomes prepared at different times of the day revealed a diurnal cycling of VGLUT to the plasma membrane. More VGLUT is digested at noon (Zeitgeber time 6) compared with the start of the light period (Zeitgeber time 0), whereas digestion of synaptophysin and synaptotagmin is independent of diurnal cycling. In contrast to VGLUT, the amount of VGAT appears not to vary diurnally but is decreased in membrane preparations from animals kept under constant darkness. We conclude that VGLUTs are sorted diurnally to the plasma membrane to modulate glutamate transmission during a day/night cycle, whereas VGAT expression is not oscillating but is increased in the presence of a light/dark cycle.

Synaptic vesicles store neurotransmitters and release them by Ca2+-dependent exocytosis upon stimulation. Transmitter loading of synaptic vesicles is achieved by vesicular transmitter transporters that utilize the proton electrochemical gradient across the vesicle membrane as an energy source. For glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, three structurally related vesicular transporters (VGLUT1–3 (vesicular glutamate transporters 1–3)) are expressed in the brain with partial overlapping expression patterns. VGLUT1 predominates in the cortex, whereas VGLUT2 is highly expressed in the diencephalon and brainstem, and VGLUT3 functions as a co-transmitter transporter in a variety of non-glutamatergic neurons (2Edwards R.H. Neuron. 2007; 55: 835-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Studies on VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 knock-out mice revealed the amount of transporter per vesicle as being crucial for the amount of glutamate loaded and the postsynaptic response (3Wojcik S.M. Rhee S.E.

Deletion of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 exerts quite different phenotypical changes, which mainly reflect the different neurons and brain areas rather than regulation of neurotransmitter loading and release at the cellular level (2Edwards R.H. Neuron. 2007; 55: 835-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). For inhibitory neurotransmitters, only one transporter, VGAT (vesicular GABA transporter), has been identified that transports both γ-aminobutyric acid and glycine (6Wojcik S.M. Katsurabashi S. Guillemin I. Friauf E. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Rhee J.S. Neuron. 2006; 50: 575-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As all biological functions, synaptic plasticity of the various neuronal systems may change during the daily occurring light/dark cycles. Daily rhythms in different tissues including brain are orchestrated by a master clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus that synchronizes the physiological and biochemical pathways. At the molecular level, two transcription factors (CLOCK and BMAL1) induce transcription of the Period (Per1, Per2, and Per3) and Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) genes. In turn, the Per and Cry gene products inhibit the activity of CLOCK and BMAL1 and thereby constitute a negative feedback loop (7Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3334) Google Scholar, 8Albrecht U. Eichele G. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 2003; 13: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This molecular principle exists in almost every cell and orchestrates the circadian aspects of brain function. We recently showed a circadian regulation of VGLUT1 expression on synaptic vesicles in the context of the day/night cycle involving Per2 (1Yelamanchili S.V. Pendyala G. Brunk I. Darna M. Albrecht U. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15671-15679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This diurnal regulation appears to be modified by regulated intracellular sorting at the level of the presynaptic terminal. VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 were originally described as inorganic sodium-dependent phosphate transporters of the plasma membrane (2Edwards R.H. Neuron. 2007; 55: 835-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 9Moriyama Y. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2004; 135: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but the physiological aspects of this occurrence are unclear. We undertook this study to see whether VGLUT, in addition to its occurrence on synaptic vesicles, may be localized to the plasma membrane and whether a switch between these compartments may explain its time-dependent expression in synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, we asked whether VGAT is changed in the context of a day/night cycle. Using Pronase digestion, we found considerable amounts of VGLUT at the plasma membrane under in vitro conditions. This localization to the plasma membrane followed the light/dark cycle. In contrast to VGLUT, VGAT expression is independent of the time of the day but decreases under the condition of complete darkness. Animals—Wistar rats were bred in the local animal house and used at the age of 3–6 months. Per2Brdm1 mice used in this study were characterized previously (10Zheng B. Larkin D.W. Albrecht U. Sun Z.S. Sage M. Eichele G. Lee C.C. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 400: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The wild-type and Per2Brdm1 animals used represent littermates derived from intercrosses between heterozygous Per2Brdm1 mice on a 129SvEvBrd/C57/BL/6-Tyrc-Brd background. Mice were kept under either an uninterrupted 12-h light/12-h dark or dark/dark cycle for at least 7 and 3 days, respectively, before the start of the experiment (11Albrecht U. Foster R.G. Methods. 2002; 28: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The following antibodies were purchased from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany): mouse monoclonal antibodies against synaptophysin (12Jahn R. Schiebler W. Oimet C. Greengard P. Proc.

Polyclonal antibodies against the 55-kDa subunit (used for rat tissue) and the 110-kDa subunit (used for mouse tissue) of Na+/K+-ATPase were from Upstate Signaling and Affinity Bioreagents, respectively. A monoclonal antibody against the mitochondrial protein TOM20 was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Secondary antibodies for Western blot detection (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit) were purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Synaptosomes and Synaptic Vesicles—Isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) were prepared at 4 °C from adult rat or mouse whole brains in the presence of protease inhibitors. In some experiments, rat synaptosomes were further purified by centrifugation through a step (6, 9, and 13%) Ficoll gradient, and the fraction enriched between 9 and 13% was used for Pronase digestion (see below). Synaptic vesicles (SVs; second lysed pellet fraction) were prepared from brains as described (15Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 16Becher A. Drenckhahn A. Hähnlein I. Magittai M. Jahn R. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1922-1931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, synaptosomal pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization solution, hypo-osmotically shocked by the addition of 9 volumes of sterile water containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and protease inhibitors, and homogenized (2000 rpm, three strokes). The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min, resulting in the first lysed pellet and the corresponding first lysed supernatant, which was carefully removed and centrifuged at 350,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman TLA 101.4 rotor. This last centrifugation step yielded a pellet (second lysed pellet) enriched for SVs. For circadian studies, mice were killed at the given time points either in the 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (Zeitgeber time (ZT)) or the dark/dark cycle (circadian time (CT)). Under appropriate conditions, wild-type and Per2Brdm1 mutants were analyzed in parallel. Protein determination was performed by the BCA method using the individual membrane fractions, and equal amounts of protein were loaded for SDS-PAGE. For each set of experiments, membrane fractions were run in parallel, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and further processed for immunodetection using the ECL detection system. ECL-processed films were scanned by video imaging, and protein bands were densitometrically quantified using the SCAN PACK 3.0 program. It was ensured that the signals were in the linear range of the ECL detection system. Quantification was performed as described (17Hinz B. Becher A. Mitter D. Schulze K. Heinemann U. Draguhn A.

Pronase Digestion—Synaptosomes (200 μg of protein) were treated with Pronase (50 μg/ml; Calbiochem) in sodium buffer (10 mm glucose, 5 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4)) for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking (30 rpm) if not stated otherwise. Pronase was removed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 5 min. In some control experiments, rat synaptosomes were permeabilized using streptolysin O (SLO) (18Brunk I. Blex C. Rachakonda S. Höltje M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 33373-33385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or extracted with Triton X 100 prior to Pronase digestion. Stimulation of Synaptosomes—Rat or mouse synaptosomes (200 μg) were stimulated with 0.5 m sucrose in Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4)) for 15 min at 37 °C with shaking (300 rpm). Stimulation was stopped by keeping synaptosomes on ice and by adding 2 volumes of Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer. Following centrifugation, Pronase digestion was performed as described above. Confocal Imaging—Mouse hippocampal neurons (19Grosse G. Eulitz D. Thiele T. Pahner I. Schröter S. Takamori S. Grosse J. Wickmann K. Tapp R. Veh R.W. Ottersen O.P. Ahnert-Hilger G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were cultivated for 6–8 days and then fixed and double-stained with a combination of VGLUT1 or VGLUT2 and one of the antibodies against Na+/K+-ATPase (see above). Confocal analysis was performed as described (20Höltje M. Hofmann F. Lux R. Veh R.W. Just I. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 9289-9299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The membrane compartment of SVs and the presynaptic plasma membrane are strongly separated in neurons under resting conditions. Following stimulation, SVs fuse with the plasma membrane, and their membrane may completely collapse in the presynaptic membrane. Thus, following fusion, lumenal peptide chains of vesicular membrane proteins are transiently exposed to the extracellular space. Generally, these vesicular membrane patches are retrieved by endocytosis, guaranteeing the integrity of the different membrane compartments. The recently described diurnal sorting of VGLUT1 was suggested to be mediated by a circadian-dependent traffic in and out at the plasma membrane (1Yelamanchili S.V. Pendyala G. Brunk I. Darna M. Albrecht U. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15671-15679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). If VGLUT plays a role at the plasma membrane, relatively larger amounts of these transporters compared with other vesicular proteins must be observed at least transiently during periods of altered synaptic activity. To analyze changes in the association of vesicular proteins with the plasma membrane, Pronase digestion was performed. Pronase is a mixture of proteolytic enzymes that should preferentially cleave the peptide chains of membrane proteins facing the extralumenal or extracellular space while respecting the lipid bilayer and leaving lumen-orientated peptides protected. Pronase digestion has been successfully applied to demonstrate the orientation of the disulfide bond in the lumen-facing loops of the vesicle protein synaptophysin (21Johnston P.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1268-1273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to estimate the lipid surface of SVs (22Takamori S. Holt M. Stenius K. Lemke E.A. Gronberg M. Riedel D. Urlaub H. Schenck S. Brüger B. Ringler P. Müller S.A. Rammner B. Gräter F. Hub J.S. De Groot B.L. Mieskes G. Moriyama Y. Klingauf J. Grubmüller H. Heuser J. Wieland F. Jahn R. Cell. 2006; 127: 831-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). When applied to synaptosomes, Pronase should also cleave the lumen-facing peptide chains of vesicular proteins sorted to the plasma membrane. Pronase Digestion of Rat and Mouse Synaptosomes—Pronase treatment at 37 °C of rat synaptosomes resulted in partial digestion of synaptophysin and VGLUTs. The NMDA receptor was first cleaved to a peptide of lower mobility, which could be further digested (Fig. 1A; see also Fig. 1C). A complete digestion of the SV proteins Rab3, synaptophysin, VGLUT1, and VGLUT2 was observed also at 4 °C when synaptosomes were permeabilized by SLO, which allows the proteolytic enzymes to seep into the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 1A), or when isolated SVs were directly treated with Pronase (Fig. 1B). Similarly, complete digestion was obtained when using synaptosomes extracted with Triton X-100 prior to Pronase treatment (Fig. 1C). To provide additional proof that Pronase respects the lipid bilayer and does not unspecifically disturb synaptosomal membranes, we analyzed Ficoll-purified rat synaptosomes for digestion of the VGLUTs, synaptophysin, Rab3, the H+-ATPase, the plasma membrane-associated proteins syntaxin and SNAP25, the extracellular facing Na+/K+-ATPase, and the mitochondrial marker protein TOM20. As shown in Fig. 1D, there was some digestion of Rab3, syntaxin, SNAP25, and TOM20. As expected, the Na+/K+-ATPase was almost completely digested. Synaptosomal preparations may be slightly contaminated by free mitochondria and SNAP25- and/or syntaxin-containing membranes derived from disrupted somata and glial cells, explaining the observed digestion. Pronase treatment and the mechanical forces from the various resuspending steps may, in addition, increase the digestion of vesicular and mitochondrial proteins due to broken synaptosomes. However, the amount of broken synaptosomes proved to be rather low in our preparations as underscored by the small amounts of digested H+-ATPase, Rab3, and VGAT (see also below). The data therefore indicate that Pronase cannot enter intact synaptosomes, which represent the majority in our preparations, and that unspecific cleavage of SV proteins negligibly contributes to digestion. This illustrates the efficacy of Pronase digestion of synaptosomes as an ideal tool to test for vesicular proteins at the plasma membrane of mature neurons in general. Next, we quantified the amount of vesicular proteins such as the VGLUTs, VGAT, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, the 110-kDa subunit of the proton ATPase, and Rab3 as well as that of some plasma membrane proteins such as the NMDA receptor and the Na+/K+-ATPase under resting conditions following Pronase digestion. We observed a digestion of 5 and 10% of the total amount of Rab3 and the proton pump, respectively, in both rat and mouse synaptosomes (Fig. 2, A and B). Because Rab3 should not be accessible for digestion, the observed decrease may be due to contaminating SVs in our preparation or to broken synaptosomes (see above). The proton pump was identified by its 115-kDa unit that has several transmembrane domains. It is present mainly on endosomal membranes, and SVs harbor only one or two copies per vesicle (22Takamori S. Holt M. Stenius K. Lemke E.A. Gronberg M. Riedel D. Urlaub H. Schenck S. Brüger B. Ringler P. Müller S.A. Rammner B. Gräter F. Hub J.S. De Groot B.L. Mieskes G. Moriyama Y. Klingauf J. Grubmüller H. Heuser J. Wieland F. Jahn R. Cell. 2006; 127: 831-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar), which will not contribute much to the overall amount. So both Rab3 and the proton pump were used as internal references. Digestion of synaptophysin was not significantly higher compared with that of either Rab3 or the proton pump and reached values between 5 and 10% when subtracting these background references (Fig. 2). Using a synaptophysin-fused pHluorin, 8% of synaptophysin was calculated to reside at the plasma membrane of boutons of hippocampal neurons in culture (23Granseth B. Odermatt B. Royle S.J. Lagnado L. Neuron. 2006; 51: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), which is in the range of the average amount of synaptophysin estimated to reside on the plasma membrane using the Pronase assay. Accordingly, Pronase digestion revealed considerable amounts of synaptotagmin (25–28%) to reside on the plasma membrane under resting conditions while normalizing with Rab3 (Fig. 2). When analyzing synaptotagmin with an antibody against its lumenal domain, ∼15% of the total amount was found to be present at the plasma membrane under resting conditions in postnatal day 1–3 hippocampal neurons (24Fernandez-Alfonso T. Kwan R. Ryan T.A. Neuron. 2006; 51: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); it was also mentioned that the amounts of synaptotagmin and a synaptobrevin-fused pHluorin on the plasma membrane were comparable. In contrast, when comparing pHluorin fusion proteins of synaptophysin and synaptobrevin, the amount of synaptobrevin at the plasma membrane exceeded that of synaptophysin by 2.5–3-fold (23Granseth B. Odermatt B. Royle S.J. Lagnado L. Neuron. 2006; 51: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Thus, the data reported for the plasma membrane pools of synaptotagmin and synaptophysin in transfected neurons are somewhat lower but in the range of the amounts found by Pronase digestion using synaptosomes from whole brain. Considerable amounts (20–30%, corrected for the Rab3 reference) of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 were digested (Fig. 2B). The amounts of VGLUT accessible to Pronase and thus presumed to be present at the plasma membrane are higher than those reported in transfection studies using hippocampal neurons and VGLUT1-pHluorin (25Voglmaier S.M. Kam K. Ynag H. Fortin D.L. Hua Z. Nicoll R.A. Edwards R.H. Neuron. 2006; 51: 71-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This may be due to the differences in the systems used, i.e. adult neurons from whole brain versus primary hippocampal neurons from embryonic brain. More important, the studies with VGLUT1-pHluorin focused on boutons and referred to transfected VGLUT1 fusion proteins in embryonic neurons, whereas Pronase digestion estimates endogenous VGLUT present in the total plasma membrane pool of a great variety of adult neurons. To determine whether endogenous VGLUT occurs at the plasma membrane under resting conditions also in early taken neurons, we analyzed the co-localization of VGLUT and the Na+/K+-ATPase in mouse hippocampal neurons. With antibodies that recognize only the cytoplasmic domains present, we performed confocal image sectioning in the z axis (surface to bottom) of the VGLUT/Na+/K+-ATPase staining. Although the majority of the VGLUT signals reflected a vesicular localization, a few double-labeled dots indicated the presence of VGLUT also at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C, arrowheads). VGLUT1 is developmentally up-regulated, leading to a different distribution in adult neurons in brain compared with embryonic or early taken postnatal neurons developing in culture, which may explain the higher values in our Pronase digestion assay. In addition, the good correlation between the amounts of synaptophysin and synaptotagmin obtained by both experimental approaches (see above) strengthens the data obtained for VGLUT. As expected, the plasma membrane-associated NMDA receptor and the Na+/K+-ATPase were digested by >60% (Fig. 2, A and B). The lack of complete digestion could be attributed to their presence also on endomembranes. Complete digestion was observed, however, when Pronase was applied to Triton extracts (see Fig. 1C). More remarkably, VGAT was not accessible to Pronase digestion in synaptosomal membranes, providing further confirmation of our Pronase assay (Fig. 2, A and B). In summary, Pronase digestion of synaptosomes from either rat or mouse brain reflects the overall distribution of vesicular proteins at the plasma membrane. Stimulation of synaptosomes should increase the amount of vesicular proteins appearing at the plasma membrane. Indeed, stimulation of synaptosomes from either rat or mouse brain with 0.5 m sucrose (generally used to provoke dramatic exocytotic events) increased the amount of digested synaptophysin, VGLUT1, and VGLUT2 with almost no change in the reference protein Rab3 (Fig. 3). This extensive stimulation caused considerable amounts of SVs to fuse with the plasma membrane, making the lumenal domains of their transmembrane proteins accessible to Pronase digestion. Hence, an increase in the digested amounts of VGLUT1, VGLUT2, synaptophysin, and synaptotagmin was observed. When corrected for the respective Rab3 values, digestion of the VGLUTs remained significant. These experiments demonstrate that Pronase digestion enables changes in the translocation of SV proteins to the plasma membrane between resting and stimulated conditions to be tracked. Time-dependent and Selective Appearance of VGLUT at the Plasma Membrane—Next, we tested the amount of vesicular proteins at the plasma membrane with or without digestion in a time of day-dependent manner. Because the daily oscillations of VGLUT1 were restricted to SV preparations and not seen with synaptosomes, we speculated that VGLUT may be sorted to the plasma membrane in a time-dependent manner (1Yelamanchili S.V. Pendyala G. Brunk I. Darna M. Albrecht U. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15671-15679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Synaptosomes from whole brains were prepared from wild-type mice entrained under a constant 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at the indicated time points, ZT24/0 at 6:00 a.m. (lights on) and ZT12 at 6:00 p.m. (lights off), and were immediately incubated with or without Pronase. Control and Pronase-treated synaptosomes taken at ZT24/0 and ZT6 were first analyzed for the proportional amount of digested VGLUT1, VGLUT2, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, and Rab3. The pattern of digestion at both time points correlated with the initial control experiments (Fig. 4; see also Fig. 2), with the most digestion obtained for the plasma membrane NMDA receptor and larger amounts of VGLUT digested compared with Rab3. Interestingly, digestion of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 was selectively enhanced at ZT6 compared with ZT24/0, whereas digestion of the NMDA receptor and the vesicular proteins synaptophysin and Rab3 remained unchanged between the time points (Fig. 4, A and B). As demonstrated before the diurnal variation, for example, the difference between ZT0 and ZT6 in the VGLUT1/synaptophysin ratio was only seen in SVs but not in synaptosomes or homogenate, the starting material of the synaptosomal and vesicular preparations (Fig. 4C) (1Yelamanchili S.V. Pendyala G. Brunk I. Darna M. Albrecht U. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15671-15679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Relative amounts of vesicular proteins based on ratios to the amount of synaptophysin or Rab3 as abundant vesicle proteins were obtained. Quantification of more than six independent preparations revealed a significant decrease at ZT6 in the ratio of both VGLUT isoforms to synaptophysin or Rab3 following Pronase digestion (Fig. 5, A and B). No change was observed in the nondigested controls taken at the indicated time points and run in parallel (Fig. 5, A and B), confirming previous observations (1Yelamanchili S.V. Pendyala G. Brunk I. Darna M. Albrecht U. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15671-15679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In our initial experiments with SVs, expression of VGLUT1 was higher before the beginning of the light phase (ZT24/0) and the dark phase (ZT12) and lower during the middle of the day (ZT6) (1Yelamanchili S.V. Pendyala G. Brunk I. Darna M. Albrecht U. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15671-15679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A similar pattern was now observed using synaptosomes treated with Pronase. This indicates that the selectively reduced amount of VGLUT on SVs is due to its specific translocation to the plasma membrane. Such a translocation was absent for the SV proteins synaptophysin and synaptotagmin. This diurnal switch between the vesicle and the plasma membrane compartment applies to both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. Synaptic terminals of glutamatergic neuronal subpopulations may differ in their cytoplasmic matrix, resulting in changes in the amount of vesicles freed by hypo-osmotic shock used under standard fractionation conditions. So it may well be that diurnal changes in the amount of VGLUT2 escaped detection in our initial analysis. Indeed, a tendency toward a diurnal oscillation has been observed (1Yelamanchili S.V. Pendyala G. Brunk I. Darna M. Albrecht U. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15671-15679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because the amount of VGLUT per vesicle is crucial for transmitter filling, the observed switch may represent a diurnal change between high and low activity of subpopulations of glutamatergic neurons. Probably the time-dependent membrane traffic allows the presynaptic terminal to replenish during physiological rest periods. How the membrane traffic of VGLUT is regulated at the presynaptic level is not clear so far. In this respect, vesicular glutamate transporters appear to be special, i.e. for VGLUT1, a highly specific reuptake pathway that is not shared by other vesicular proteins has been described (25Voglmaier S.M. Kam K. Ynag H. Fortin D.L. Hua Z. Nicoll R.A. Edwards R.H. Neuron. 2006; 51: 71-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5Oscillation of VGLUT amounts in Pronase-digested synaptosomes under light/dark conditions. A, the synaptosomes shown in Fig. 5, including preparations at ZT12 (dusk, just before the light was switched off), were analyzed for the proteins indicated. B, quantification was performed by calculating the ratio of synaptophysin and Rab3 to VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in non-digested and Pronase-treated samples. Values were obtained from three different experimental sets and represent the means of four to five animals per individual time point. *, significance (p < 0.05, according to Student's t test) between ZT24/0 or ZT12 and ZT6. Syp, synaptophysin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Currently, we do not know whether VGLUT at the plasma membrane indeed represents a physiologically relevant transporter for NaPO4 or only a storage pool. The interpretation is further complicated by the fact that the ionic basis of VGLUT transport activity for either NaPO4 or glutamate is far from being understood. However, the occurrence of large amounts of VGLUT at the plasma membrane and the diurnal regulation of its traffic are in line with observations obtained with other transmitter transporters. Activity-dependent traffic in and out of the plasma membrane has been described for monoamine transporters such as the serotonin transporter SERT (26Steiner J.A. Carneiro A.M.D. Blakely R.D. Traffic. 2008; 9: 1392-1402Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Whereas these transporters reside on endocytotic vesicles, the choline transporter, which returns choline to the presynaptic terminal for acetylcholine synthesis, is directly localized to acetylcholine-storing SVs. This transporter is functional at the plasma membrane and appears to be inhibited when localized to SVs (27Iwamoto J.A. Blakely R.D. DeFelice L.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9851-9859Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transmitter transporters of the plasma membrane are probably functionally linked to transporters of SVs by regulating traffic between both membrane compartments. Whether in this respect VGLUT has a dual transport function remains to be determined. One may speculate at to how such diurnal modulation of glutamatergic transmission is achieved in the context of the whole brain. Probably at each switch, different dark/light or light/dark populations of neurons enhance their VGLUT equipment to be prepared for the specific task of the coming light or dark period, respectively. Neurons being more active just before the start of the light period may decrease their vesicular VGLUT content by sorting some copies to the plasma membrane during the middle of the day, probably before the ones responsible for the dark period tasks start to replenish their vesicular VGLUT. This explanation may also apply for the low amounts of VGLUT1 seen in the middle of the night (1Yelamanchili S.V. Pendyala G. Brunk I. Darna M. Albrecht U. Ahnert-Hilger G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15671-15679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression of the Vesicular GABA Transporter VGAT—The changes in the time-dependent cellular distribution of VGLUT prompted us to investigate whether VGAT may also be regulated in a time-dependent manner. There were no changes in the vesicular amount of VGAT at the indicated Zeitgeber time points, given as the VGAT/synaptophysin ratio (Fig. 6A, upper left graph). There were also no significant differences between wild-type mice and mice lacking the clock gene Per2 (Per2Brdm1 mice) (Fig. 6A, right graphs). However, when comparing the amount of VGAT in mice entrained in a constant 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (ZT condition) with that in mice kept under complete darkness (CT condition), the latter showed a reduction in VGAT expression. This reduction was also evident in synaptosomal preparations and was independent of the presence of Per2 (Fig. 6, A and B). VGAT was also expressed in the absence of light; hence, its expression is not light-dependent. However, a light/dark cycle increased VGAT expression. In conclusion, we report mechanistic evidence supporting our hypothesis that diurnal cycling in the amount of VGLUT is due to a unique sorting event that occurs between the vesicular and plasma membrane compartments. In contrast, regulation of VGAT is not mediated by a diurnal sorting mechanism in the terminal. However, light seems to be a strong signal to increase VGAT expression.

https://openalex.org/W2051619209,"Plasma membrane chloride (Cl(-)) pathways play an important role in neuronal physiology. Here, we investigated the role of NKCC1 cotransporters (a secondary active Cl(-) uptake mechanism) in Cl(-) handling in cultured rat dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGNs) and motor neurons (MNs) derived from fetal stage embryonic day 14. Gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings revealed that DRGNs accumulate intracellular Cl(-) through a bumetanide- and Na(+)-sensitive mechanism, indicative of the functional expression of NKCC1. Western blotting confirmed the expression of NKCC1 in both DRGNs and MNs, but immunocytochemistry experiments showed a restricted expression in dendrites of MNs, which contrasts with a homogeneous expression in DRGNs. Both MNs and DRGNs could be readily loaded with or depleted of Cl(-) during GABA(A) receptor activation at depolarizing or hyperpolarizing membrane potentials. After loading, the rate of recovery to the resting Cl(-) concentration (i.e., [Cl(-)](i) decrease) was similar in both cell types and was unaffected by lowering the extracellular Na(+) concentration. In contrast, the recovery on depletion (i.e., [Cl(-)](i) increase) was significantly faster in DRGNs in control conditions but not in low extracellular Na(+). The experimental observations could be reproduced by a mathematical model for intracellular Cl(-) kinetics, in which DRGNs show higher NKCC1 activity and smaller Cl(-)-handling volume than MNs. On the basis of these results, we conclude that embryonic DRGNs show a higher somatic functional expression of NKCC1 than embryonic MNs. The high NKCC1 activity in DRGNs is important for maintaining high [Cl(-)](i), whereas lower NKCC1 activity in MNs allows large [Cl(-)](i) variations during neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2016466830,"Background Most previous analyses of scrapie outbreaks have focused on flocks run by research institutes, which may not reflect the field situation. Within this study, we attempt to rectify this deficit by describing the epidemiological characteristics of 30 sheep flocks naturally-infected with classical scrapie, and by exploring possible underlying causes of variation in the characteristics between flocks, including flock-level prion protein (PrP) genotype profile. In total, the study involved PrP genotype data for nearly 8600 animals and over 400 scrapie cases. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that most scrapie cases were restricted to just two PrP genotypes (ARQ/VRQ and VRQ/VRQ), though two flocks had markedly different affected genotypes, despite having similar underlying genotype profiles to other flocks of the same breed; we identified differences amongst flocks in the age of cases of certain PrP genotypes; we found that the age-at-onset of clinical signs depended on peak incidence and flock type; we found evidence that purchasing infected animals is an important means of introducing scrapie to a flock; we found some evidence that flock-level PrP genotype profile and flock size account for variation in outbreak characteristics; identified seasonality in cases associated with lambing time in certain flocks; and we identified one case that was homozygous for phenylalanine at codon 141, a polymorphism associated with a very high risk of atypical scrapie, and 28 cases that were heterozygous at this codon. Conclusions/Significance This paper presents the largest study to date on commercially-run sheep flocks naturally-infected with classical scrapie, involving 30 study flocks, more than 400 scrapie cases and over 8500 PrP genotypes. We show that some of the observed variation in epidemiological characteristics between farms is related to differences in their PrP genotype profile; although much remains unexplained and may instead be attributed to the stochastic nature of scrapie dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1981196517,"OBF1, also known as Bob.1 or OCA-B, is a B lymphocyte-specific transcription factor which coactivates Oct1 and Oct2 on B cell specific promoters. So far, the function of OBF1 has been mainly identified in late stage B cell populations. The central defect of OBF1 deficient mice is a severely reduced immune response to T cell-dependent antigens and a lack of germinal center formation in the spleen. Relatively little is known about a potential function of OBF1 in developing B cells. Here we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing OBF1 in B cells under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter and enhancer. Surprisingly, these mice have greatly reduced numbers of follicular B cells in the periphery and have a compromised immune response. Furthermore, B cell differentiation is impaired at an early stage in the bone marrow: a first block is observed during B cell commitment and a second differentiation block is seen at the large preB2 cell stage. The cells that succeed to escape the block and to differentiate into mature B cells have post-translationally downregulated the expression of transgene, indicating that expression of OBF1 beyond the normal level early in B cell development is deleterious. Transcriptome analysis identified genes deregulated in these mice and Id2 and Id3, two known negative regulators of B cell differentiation, were found to be upregulated in the EPLM and preB cells of the transgenic mice. Furthermore, the Id2 and Id3 promoters contain octamer-like sites, to which OBF1 can bind. These results provide evidence that tight regulation of OBF1 expression in early B cells is essential to allow efficient B lymphocyte differentiation."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of one or more isoforms of the peroxiredoxins is not lethal but compromises genome stability by mechanisms that remain under scrutiny. Here, we show that cytosolic peroxiredoxin-null cells (tsa1Δtsa2Δ) are more resistant to hydrogen peroxide than wild-type (WT) cells and consume it faster under fermentative conditions. Also, tsa1Δtsa2Δ cells produced higher yields of the 1-hydroxyethyl radical from oxidation of the glucose metabolite ethanol, as proved by spin-trapping experiments. A major role for Fenton chemistry in radical formation was excluded by comparing WT and tsa1Δtsa2Δ cells with respect to their levels of total and chelatable metal ions and of radical produced in the presence of chelators. The main route for 1-hydroxyethyl radical formation was ascribed to the peroxidase activity of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1), whose expression and activity increased ∼5- and 2-fold, respectively, in tsa1Δtsa2Δ compared with WT cells. Accordingly, overexpression of human Sod1 in WT yeasts led to increased 1-hydroxyethyl radical production. Relevantly, tsa1Δtsa2Δ cells challenged with hydrogen peroxide contained higher levels of DNA-derived radicals and adducts as monitored by immuno-spin trapping and incorporation of 14C from glucose into DNA, respectively. The results indicate that part of hydrogen peroxide consumption by tsa1Δtsa2Δ cells is mediated by induced Sod1, which oxidizes ethanol to the 1-hydroxyethyl radical, which, in turn, leads to increased DNA damage.

Living organisms are constantly exposed to oxygen- and nitrogen-derived reactive species that are produced by normal metabolic activity and in response to external stimuli. To protect themselves against the toxicity of these species, aerobic organisms have evolved a range of defense mechanisms (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 4th Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2007: 79-186Google Scholar). Among these, a family of cysteine-based peroxidases, currently named peroxiredoxins, has attracted considerable attention because of its ubiquity and versatility. These enzymes have been shown to detoxify hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides and peroxynitrite through oxidation of their reactive cysteine residues, which are recycled back by reducing equivalents provided by thioredoxin and other thiol-electron donors (reviewed in Refs. 2Hofmann B.

Many organisms have multiple peroxiredoxins. Six peroxiredoxins have been identified in human cells, and five in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Peroxiredoxin isoforms are distributed to different locations within the cell, and two of the yeast peroxiredoxins, Tsa1 and Tsa2, are cytosolic (10Park S.G. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Tsa1 was the first peroxiredoxin identified in eukaryotes. It is expressed constitutively and corresponds to 0.7% of total soluble protein content in this species. In contrast, the levels of Tsa2 are very low under normal conditions, but are highly induced upon treatment of the yeast with peroxides (11Munhoz D.C. Netto L.E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35219-35227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Monje-Casas F. Michan C. Pueyo C. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Tsa1 and Tsa2 share 86% identity in their amino acid sequence, and both react with hydrogen peroxide with second order rate constants similar to those of hemoproteins, such as catalase (k ∼ 107 m–1 s–1) (13Ogusucu R. Rettori D. Munhoz D.C. Netto L.E.S. Augusto O. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Deletion of the TSA1 gene increases the expression of Tsa2 and other peroxiredoxin isoforms (10Park S.G. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 14Wong C.-M. Zhou Y. Ng R.W.M. Kung H.-F. Jin D.-Y. J. Biol.

FEBS J. 2006; 273: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that these peroxidases have both redundant and non-redundant physiological functions. The deletion of one or all of the peroxiredoxin genes in S. cerevisiae is not lethal, probably because of the resulting increase in the levels of other antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase, cytochrome c peroxidase, and Sod1, that has been demonstrated by transcriptional and proteomic analysis (10Park S.G. Cha M.K. Jeong W. Kim I.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 15Demasi A.P. Pereira G.A. Netto L.E.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 23207-23213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A problem arising from this compensatory response, however, is the mutator phenotype of the peroxiredoxin-null strains that display increased spontaneous mutation rates and accumulated gross chromosomal rearrangements (16Wong C.-M. Siu K.L. Jin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23207-23213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Huang M. Rio A. Nicolas A. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These consequences are particularly conspicuous in TSA1-null cells, suggesting a major contribution of Tsa1 to genome stability. Such protection has been attributed to the ability of Tsa1 to reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species that would otherwise oxidize DNA leading to mutations, chromosomal rearrangements and cell death. These genetic and lethality studies, however, did not provide mechanistic insights on how deletion of peroxiredoxin genes leads to DNA damage nor to its molecular nature (16Wong C.-M. Siu K.L. Jin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23207-23213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Huang M. Rio A. Nicolas A. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here, contrary to the common notion, we show that deletion of both TSA1 and TSA2 genes in S. cerevisiae increases resistance to toxic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. In parallel, hydrogen peroxide consumption and ethanol- and DNA-derived radical formation are increased mainly through higher expression of the enzyme Sod1. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, or Fisher and were analytical grade or better. Yeast nitrogen base (20Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar) was from Difco and media supplements (amino acids, adenine and uracil) were from Sigma-Aldrich or Synth. Desferrioxamine was purchased from Novartis. Bathocuproine disulfonic acid and [2-13C]ethanol were from Sigma-Aldrich. Hydrogen peroxide concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 240 nm (∊240 = 43.6 m–1 cm–1) (21Claiborne A. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 283-284Google Scholar). All solutions were prepared with water purified in a Millipore Milli-Q system. All buffers were treated with Chelex-100 to remove trace amounts of metal ion contaminants prior to use. S. Cerevisiae Strains and Growth Conditions—The wild-type strain employed was BY4741 (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0), whereas the mutant strains were: tsa1Δ (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; YML028W::KAN MX4), tsa2Δ (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; YDR453C::KAN MX4), and tsa1Δ tsa2Δ (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; met15Δ0; ura3Δ0; tsa1::KAN MX4; tsa2::LEU2). The first three strains were obtained from EUROSCARF, whereas the double mutant (generated according to Ref. 14Wong C.-M. Zhou Y. Ng R.W.M. Kung H.-F. Jin D.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5385-5394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was kindly donated by Dr. Jin (University of Hong Kong, China University). Yeasts overexpressing Sod1 were obtained by standard transformation (22Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Borchelt D.R. Gwinn R. Valentine J.S. Sisodia S. Wong P. Lee M. Hahn H. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) of the BY47411 strain with the YEp600 plasmid containing one copy of the human sod1 gene with its own promoter. This plasmid was extracted from EGy118 yeasts provided by Dr. Edith B. Gralla. The strains were grown in complete synthetic media (yeast nitrogen base) supplemented with 2% glucose, amino acids, adenine, and uracil under shaking at 300 rpm, 30 °C (11Munhoz D.C. Netto L.E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35219-35227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For all experiments, strains were grown overnight, diluted to A600 nm = 0.2, and collected as soon as they reached mid-log phase (A600 nm = 0.8). Growth curves under fermentative conditions were obtained for the four strains by diluting overnight cultures to A600 nm = 0.2 and by monitoring the optical density at 2-h intervals. Viability Assay—The viability of the cells was monitored by the number of colony forming units. Cell cultures at mid-log phase of growth were washed with 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mm DTPA, 3The abbreviations used are: DTPA, diethylenetriamine-N,N,N,N-pentaacetic; FOX, ferrous oxidation xylenol orange assay; DMPO, 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide; POBN, α-(4-pyridil-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone; Tsa1 and -2, cytosolic thioredoxin peroxidases 1 and 2; WT, wild type. pH 7.4, and resuspended in growth media to a density of 5 × 107 cells/ml. Half of the cell suspension was treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide under shaking at 350 rpm for 30 min at 30 °C; the other half was treated with the same volume of buffer and incubated as above. The cell suspensions were then serially diluted, and 100-μl aliquots of 1/104 and 1/105 dilution were plated onto complete synthetic media supplemented with 2% glucose and 2% agar. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days, and the colony forming unit was number counted. The results shown are expressed as the percentage of colony forming units of hydrogen peroxide-treated cultures in relation to the corresponding controls. Hydrogen Peroxide Consumption—Hydrogen peroxide consumption was determined by the ferrous oxidation xylenol orange assay (FOX) (23Wolff S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Cells at mid-log phase were treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide as above. At the specified times, 50-μl aliquots were diluted with 500 μl of growth media and mixed with 950 μl of FOX solution (100 μm xylenol orange, 250 μm ammonium ferrous sulfate, 100 mm sorbitol, and 25 mm sulfuric acid). After 30-min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance of the samples was read at 560 nm. Calibration was performed with a standard solution of hydrogen peroxide. Detection of Ethanol-derived Radicals—Production of the 1-hydroxyethyl radical formed from the oxidation of ethanol, a glucose metabolite, was detected by EPR spin-trapping experiments with POBN (24Nakao L.S. Augusto O. (1998) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Roe J.A. Wiedau-Pazos M. Moy V.N. Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) in growth media containing glucose were preincubated with 90 mm POBN for 5 min and 1 mm hydrogen peroxide was added under shaking at 30 °C. After 30 min, aliquots were transferred to flat cells, and the EPR spectra were scanned. In some experiments, cells were incubated with POBN as above, and 171 mm [2-13C]ethanol was added together with hydrogen peroxide. In other experiments, cells in growth media containing glucose were preincubated with 2 mm desferrioxamine, 2 mm bathocuproine disulfonic acid, or with 10 mm diethyldithiocarbamate for 30 min or 1 h before addition of the components specified above. Also, cells in media alone were heated at 90 °C for 20 min and brought to 30 °C before addition of glucose, POBN, and hydrogen peroxide. In the case of purified enzymes, 10 μm catalase, horseradish peroxidase, cytochrome c, or bovine Sod1 was incubated with 90 mm POBN, 1 mm hydrogen peroxide, 0.1 mm DTPA, and 171 mm ethanol in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 30 °C. After 30-min incubation, the samples were transferred to flat cells, and the EPR spectra were scanned. In the case of Sod1, kinetic experiments were also performed. EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) on a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with an ER4122 SHQ 9807 high sensitivity cavity. Radical adduct quantification was performed by double integration of the EPR spectra and comparison with a standard solution of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy. Computer simulation analyses of some spectra were performed by using a program written by Duling (26Duling D.R. J. Magn. Res. 1994; 104: 105-110Crossref Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Chelatable Iron Ion Measurements—Chelatable iron levels in the strains were determined by low temperature EPR after chelation with desferrioxamine (27Srinivasan C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29187-29192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Linares E. Nakao L.S. Augusto O. Kadiiska M.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). WT and tsa1Δtsa2Δ cells were collected at mid-log growth phase. Approximately 109 cells of each strain were resuspended in 10 ml of fresh growth medium without glucose, but containing 2 mm desferrioxamine. After 30-min incubation at 30 °C, cells were collected and washed with 10 ml of cold Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), pH 7.4. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of the same buffer containing 10% glycerol, transferred to a 1-ml disposable syringe, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were extruded from the syringe into a finger-tip Dewar flask containing liquid nitrogen and examined by EPR at 77 K in the region of g ∼4.0 (28Linares E. Nakao L.S. Augusto O. Kadiiska M.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The concentration of the desferrioxamine-iron complex present in the cell suspensions was obtained by double integration of the EPR signal and comparison with a standard curve constructed with known concentrations of the iron(III)-desferrioxamine complex. This was prepared by mixing different concentrations of ferrous ammonium sulfate with 2 mm desferrioxamine; the complex concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (∊430 = 2865 m–1 cm–1) (29Yegorov D.Yu. Kozlov A.V. Azizova O.A. Vladimirov Y.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Total Iron, Copper, and Zinc Ion Measurements—Levels of iron, copper, and zinc ions in each strain were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Approximately 109 cells from each strain were washed in metal-free water, resuspended in a solution of nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and water (2:1:3, v/v), and digested in a microwave oven. The metal contents of the digested samples were determined in an Analytikjena AG, AAS ZEEnit 60 instrument. Iron, copper, and zinc were detected at 324.8, 248.3, and 213.9 nm, respectively (30Naozuka J. Oliveira P.V. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 2007; 18: 1547-1553Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Total Peroxide Measurements—Levels of total peroxides in WT and tsa1Δ tsa2Δ strains were determined by the FOX assay (23Wolff S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 182-189Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) as adapted to yeasts (31Salmon J.-M. Fornairon-Bonnefond C. Mazauric J.-P. Moutounet M. Food Chem. 2000; 71: 519-528Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) of each strain were washed and resuspended in growth media and treated or not with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide. After 30-min incubation, the cells were washed twice and resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer. An equal volume of glass beads (425–600 μm) was added, and the samples were vortexed (1 min) and ice-cooled. After addition of 900 μl of cool methanol containing 4 mm butylated hydroxytoluene, the samples were submitted to two cycles of vortexing (1 min) and ice cooling. Next, the samples were centrifuged (1000 × g, 10 min). The supernatants were collected (100 μl) and mixed with 900 μl of the FOX reagent (100 μm xylenol orange, 250 μm ammonium ferrous sulfate, 25 mm sulfuric acid, and 4 mm butylated hydroxytoluene in 90% (v/v) methanol). After 30-min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance of the samples was read at 560 nm. According to previous calibrations performed with standard peroxides, a mean apparent extinction coefficient of 4.5 × 104 m–1 cm–1 was employed (31Salmon J.-M. Fornairon-Bonnefond C. Mazauric J.-P. Moutounet M. Food Chem. 2000; 71: 519-528Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Expression of Sod1—The level of Sod1 expression in WT and tsa1Δ tsa2Δ strains was determined by Western blot analysis. To this end, cell extracts of the strains were obtained as previously described (11Munhoz D.C. Netto L.E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35219-35227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells collected at mid-log growth phase were washed and resuspended in 50 mm Hepes buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml of pepstatin. Next, an equal volume of glass beads (425–600 μm) was added. After 2 cycles of vortexing (6 min) and ice-cooling (6 min), the samples were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 5 min). The supernatants were collected and centrifuged again (16,000 × g, 30 min) to remove precipitated material. The supernatants are referred to as cell extracts, and their protein contents were determined by the Bradford method with a Bio-Rad Kit. Cell extracts (40 μg of protein) were submitted to electrophoresis (12% acrylamide gel) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-D Extra, Amersham Biosciences). After washing (3 times, 10 min) with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), the membrane was blocked with TBST (TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk, at room temperature for 90 min. The primary antibody was anti-human Sod1 (Calbiochem) prepared in TBST containing 0.1% nonfat milk (1:1.500 dilution). Excess antibody was removed by washing three times with TBST. The membrane was then incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-sheep IgG, peroxidase conjugated, Calbiochem) prepared in TBST containing 0.1% nonfat milk (1:7,000 dilution). After 1-h incubation, the membrane was washed three times with TBST and treated for 5 min with the solutions from the kit SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and exposed to an x-ray film. Relative quantification of the bands was performed by densitometry (ImageQuaNT V5.2, Molecular Dynamics). Superoxide Dismutase Activity—Superoxide dismutase activity in WT and tsa1Δ tsa2Δ cell extracts was determined by native PAGE staining (32Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9524) Google Scholar) and inhibition of cytochrome c reduction (33McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 217-220Google Scholar). After electrophoresis of cell extracts (40 μg of protein) under non-reducing conditions, the gel was incubated in the dark for 20 min with a solution composed of 0.25 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium plus 0.1 mg/ml riboflavin. Then, a solution of 10 mg/ml N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine was added, and the gel was kept under shaking and light until bands became visible (32Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9524) Google Scholar). Relative quantification of the bands was performed by densitometry (ImageQuaNT V5.2). The cytochrome c reduction assay was performed as previously described (33McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Oberley L.W. Spitz D.R. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 217-220Google Scholar). The incubations contained 100 μm xanthine and xanthine oxidase in amounts that cause an absorbance change of 0.025/min, 1 unit of catalase, and cell extracts (0–50 μg protein) in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 30 °C. Bicarbonate-dependent Peroxidase Activity—This activity was evaluated in whole cells by EPR monitoring of the oxidation of the spin-trap 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) to DMPO/·OH radical adduct was monitored (35Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 36Medinas D.B. Cerchiaro G. Trindade D.F. Augusto O. IUBMB Life. 2007; 59: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) of each strain were resuspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mm DTPA, pH 7.4, and incubated with 80 mm DMPO at room temperature for 5 min. After addition of 25 mm sodium bicarbonate and 1 mm hydrogen peroxide, the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and transferred to flat cells, and their EPR spectra were scanned at room temperature as described above. Quantification of radical adduct was performed by double integration of the EPR spectra and comparison with a standard solution of 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy. Detection of DNA-derived Radicals—Formation of DNA-derived radicals was monitored by immuno-spin trapping employing DMPO and the antibody against oxidized DMPO adducts (37Ramirez D.C. Gomez-Mejiba S.E. Mason R.P. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 107 cells/ml) of each strain were washed, resuspended in fresh media, and treated with 100 mm DMPO and 1 mm hydrogen peroxide at 30 °C. After 30-min incubation, the cells were washed with distilled water (2 times) and resuspended in 800 μl of a buffer to digest cell walls (0.9 m sorbitol, 0.1 m EDTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 3.5 μg/ml zymolyase 20T) (38Philippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). After 2-h incubation at 37 °C, samples were centrifuged (1,000 × g, 10 min), and the spheroplasts obtained were resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm DTPA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). From this point on, DNA extraction and transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane followed the previously described protocol (37Ramirez D.C. Gomez-Mejiba S.E. Mason R.P. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DNA extracted from WT cells (100 ng) treated with 50 mm DMPO, 1 mm CuCl2, and 20 μm hydrogen peroxide in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 30 °C was employed as a positive control. DNA radicals/DMPO nitrone adducts blotted onto the nitrocellulose membrane were detected with the anti-DMPO nitrone adduct antibody provided by Dr. Ronald P. Mason (37Ramirez D.C. Gomez-Mejiba S.E. Mason R.P. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). First, the membrane was blocked for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline buffer (0.725 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 80 mm Na2HPO4 and 14 mm KH2PO4) containing 3% nonfat milk. After washing for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with the anti-DMPO/adduct antibody for 1 h. The antibody was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (1:10,000 dilution). Excess antibody was removed by three 10-min washes with the same buffer, and the membrane was incubated 1 h with the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-conjugated). After one phosphate-buffered saline wash, the membrane was incubated with the solutions from the kit SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology) for 5 min and exposed to an x-ray film. Relative quantification of the bands was performed by densitometry (ImageQuaNT V5.2). Detection of DNA Adducts—To probe for the addition of glucose metabolites to yeast DNA, we monitored incorporation of 14C at the DNA by the strains grown in media supplemented with [14C]glucose (Schwarz/Mann; 1 mCi/ml and 230 mCi/mm). Cells (2 × 108) harvested at the exponential growth phase were resuspended in 500 μl of fresh media containing four times less glucose than usual and supplemented with 50 μCi of [14C]glucose (39Sentandreu R. Northcote D.H. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These samples were treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 30 min at 30 °C, in the absence or presence of POBN (90 mm). DNA from the samples was extracted as above. DNA (100 ng) from each experimental condition was transferred to filter paper that was incubated with scintillation liquid. Radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation analyzer (166 TR, Packard). tsa1Δtsa2Δ Cells Are More Resistant to Hydrogen Peroxide but Metabolize It Faster Producing Ethanol-derived Radicals—As previously reported (11Munhoz D.C.

https://openalex.org/W2046187707,"Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) exerts important endocrine and paracrine functions in the cardiovascular system. We identified the common variant -1411C>T in the IGF1 upstream promoter P1, located within several overlapping transcription factor binding sites. Using transient transfection assays, we identified this site as a functional enhancer. The T allele-carrying enhancer, compared with the C allelic portion, exerts significantly reduced or even abrogated activity, respectively, in SaOs-2 and HepG2 (all P<0.0001) as well as in differentiated THP-1 macrophages. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and subsequent supershift experiments in HepG2 identified c-Jun as the binding partner exclusively to the T allele, whereas CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta and interferon consensus site-binding protein/interferon-regulating factor 8 interacted only with the C allelic promoter portion. Furthermore, genotyping in a case-control study for essential hypertension (n=745 hypertensive patients; n=769 normotensive control subjects) for this variant revealed an odds ratio for hypertension of 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.58-0.91, P=0.006) associated with the T allele, and normotensive subjects carrying the protective T allele displayed a significant decrease in diastolic (P=0.036) and systolic (P=0.024) blood pressure levels. We here report detection of a functional enhancer module in the upstream IGF1 promoter region, which might play a key role in local IGF1 bioavailability. Whether -1411C>T is also associated with other IGF1-related disease phenotypes should be evaluated further in population studies."
https://openalex.org/W2085616704,"The fish medaka is the first vertebrate capable of full spermatogenesis in vitro from self-renewing spermatogonial stem cells to motile test-tube sperm. Precise staging and molecular dissection of this process has been hampered by the lack of suitable molecular markers.We have generated a normalized medaka testis cDNA library and obtained 7040 high quality sequences representing 3641 unique gene clusters. Among these, 1197 unique clusters are homologous to known genes, and 2444 appear to be novel genes. Ontology analysis shows that the 1197 gene products are implicated in diverse molecular and cellular processes. These genes include markers for all major types of testicular somatic and germ cells. Furthermore, markers were identified for major spermatogenic stages ranging from spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal to meiosis entry, progression and completion. Intriguingly, the medaka testis expresses at least 13 homologs of the 33 mouse X-chromosomal genes that are enriched in the testis. More importantly, we show that key components of several signaling pathways known to be important for testicular function in mammals are well represented in the medaka testicular EST collection.Medaka exhibits a considerable similarity in testicular gene expression to mammals. The medaka testicular EST collection we obtained has wide range coverage and will not only consolidate our knowledge on the comparative analysis of known genes' functions in the testis but also provide a rich resource to dissect molecular events and mechanism of spermatogenesis in vivo and in vitro in medaka as an excellent vertebrate model."
https://openalex.org/W2077520892,"Alcoholism is a widespread chronic disorder of complex aetiology with a significant negative impact on the individual and the society. Mechanisms of ethanol action are not sufficiently well understood at the molecular level and the pharmacotherapy of alcoholism is still in its infancy. Our study focuses at the cellular and molecular level on ethanol-induced effects that are mediated through the micro-opioid receptor (MOP) and on the effects of naltrexone, a well-known antagonist at MOP that is used clinically to prevent relapse in alcoholism.Advanced fluorescence imaging by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) are used to study ethanol effects on MOP and plasma membrane lipid dynamics in live PC12 cells. We observed that relevant concentrations of ethanol (10-40 mM) alter MOP mobility and surface density, and affect the dynamics of plasma membrane lipids. Compared to the action of specific ligands at MOP, ethanol-induced effects show complex kinetics and point to a biphasic underlying mechanism. Pretreatment with naloxone or naltrexone considerably mitigates the effects of ethanol.We suggest that ethanol acts by affecting the sorting of MOP at the plasma membrane of PC12 cells. Naltrexone exerts opposite effects on MOP sorting at the plasma membrane, thereby countering the effects of ethanol. Our experimental findings give new insight on MOP-mediated ethanol action at the cellular and molecular level. We suggest a new hypothesis to explain the well established ethanol-induced increase in the activity of the endogenous opioid system."
https://openalex.org/W1967909294,"The Escherichia coli envelope stress response is controlled by the alternative sigma factor, sigma(E), and is induced when unfolded outer membrane proteins accumulate in the periplasm. The response is initiated by sequential cleavage of the membrane-spanning antisigma factor, RseA. RseB is an important negative regulator of envelope stress response that exerts its negative effects onsigma(E) activity through its binding to RseA. In this study, we analyze the interaction between RseA and RseB. We found that tight binding of RseB to RseA required intact RseB. Using programs that performed global and local sequence alignment of RseB and RseA, we found regions of high similarity and performed alanine substitution mutagenesis to test the hypothesis that these regions were functionally important. This protocol is based on the hypothesis that functionally dependent regions of two proteins co-evolve and therefore are likely to be sequentially conserved. This procedure allowed us to identify both an N-terminal and C-terminal region in RseB important for binding to RseA. We extensively analyzed the C-terminal region, which aligns with a region of RseA coincident with the major RseB binding determinant in RseA. Both allele-specific suppression analysis and cysteine-mediated disulfide bond formation indicated that this C-terminal region of similarity of RseA and RseB identifies a contact site between the two proteins. We suggest a similar protocol can be successfully applied to pairs of non-homologous but functionally linked proteins to find specific regions of the protein sequences that are important for establishing functional linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1990830617,"Background NORE1A and RASSF1A are growth and tumour suppressors inactivated in a variety of cancers. Methylation of NORE1A and RASSF1A promoters is the predominant mechanism for downregulation of these proteins; however, other mechanisms are likely to exist. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a proteolysis of NORE1A and RASSF1A by calpains as alternative mechanism of their downregulation. Extracts of H358 cell line, a human bronchoalveolar carcinoma, and H460, a large cell carcinoma, were capable of proteolysis of NORE1A protein in the calpain-dependent manner. Likewise, RASSF1A tumor suppressor was proteolyzed by the H358 cell extract. Addition of calpain inhibitor to H358 and H460 cells growing in tissue culture resulted in re-expression of endogenous NORE1A. A survey of 10 human lung tumours revealed that three of them contain an activity capable of inducing NORE1A degradation. Conclusions/Significance Thus, degradation by calpains is a novel mechanism for downregulation of NORE1A and RASSF1A proteins and might be the mechanism allowing cancer cells to escape growth suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2085106837,"Cell cycle regulation and biochemical responses upon nutrients and growth factors are the major regulatory mechanisms for cell sizing in mammals. Recently, we identified that the death effector domain-containing DEDD impedes mitotic progression by inhibiting Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) and thus maintains an increase of cell size during the mitotic phase. Here we found that DEDD also associates with S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and supports its activity by preventing inhibitory phosphorylation of S6K1 brought about by Cdk1 during the mitotic phase. DEDD(-/-) cells showed reduced S6K1 activity, consistently demonstrating decreased levels in activating phosphorylation at the Thr-389 site. In addition, levels of Cdk1-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation at the C terminus of S6K1 were enhanced in DEDD(-/-) cells and tissues. Consequently, as in S6K1(-/-) mice, the insulin mass within pancreatic islets was reduced in DEDD(-/-) mice, resulting in glucose intolerance. These findings suggest a novel cell sizing mechanism achieved by DEDD through the maintenance of S6K1 activity prior to cell division. Our results also suggest that DEDD may harbor important roles in glucose homeostasis and that its deficiency might be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2043519734,"It remains controversial how HCV coinfection influences the disease progression during HIV-1 infection. This study aims to define the influence of HCV infection on the replication of HIV-1 and the disease progression in HIV-infected former plasma donors (FPDs) naïve to ART.168 HIV-1-infected FPDs were enrolled into a cohort study from Anhui province in central China, and thereafter monitored at month 3, 9, 15, 21 and 33. Fresh whole blood samples were used for CD4+ T-cell counting. Their plasma samples were collected and stored for quantification of HIV-1 viral loads and for determination of HCV and Toxoplasma. Out of 168 HIV-infected FBDs, 11.9% (20 cases), 80.4% (135 cases) and 7.7% (13 cases) were infected with HIV-1 alone, HIV-1/HCV and HIV/HCV/Toxoplasma, respectively. During the 33-month follow-up, only 35% (7 out of 20 cases) HIV-1 mono-infected subjects remained their CD4+ T-cell counts above 200 cells/microl and retained on the cohort study, which was significantly lower than 56% (75 out of 135 cases) for HIV/HCV group and 69% (9 out of 13 cases) for HIV/HCV/Toxoplasma group (p<0.05). CD4+ T cells in HIV mono infection group were consistently lower than that in HIV/HCV group (p = 0.04, 0.18, 0.03 and 0.04 for baseline, month 9, month 21 and month 33 visit, respectively). In accordance with those observations, HIV viral loads in HIV mono-infection group were consistently higher than that in HIV/HCV group though statistical significances were only reached at baseline (p = 0.04).These data indicated HCV coinfection with HIV-1 is associated with the slower disease progression at the very late stage when comparing with HIV-1 mono-infection. The coinfection of Toxoplasma with HIV and HCV did not exert additional influence on the disease progression. It will be highly interesting to further explore the underlying mechanism for this observation in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2000872999,"A substantial body of evidence indicates that protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the alpha-secretory processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), an event that reduces the formation of the pathogenic amyloid-beta peptide. Recently, we have shown that trafficking and processing of APP are both impaired by knockdown of myosin II-B, one of the major neuronal motor proteins. Here, we provide evidence that the alpha-secretory processing of APP is mediated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation of myosin II-B. This signaling pathway provides an important link between APP and the neuronal cytoskeleton and might be crucial for the understanding of the biological and pathological roles of APP."
https://openalex.org/W2154075660,"Human carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (hCPS) has evolved critical features that allow it to remove excess and potentially neurotoxic ammonia via the urea cycle, including use of only free ammonia as a nitrogen donor, a K(m) for ammonia 100-fold lower than for CPSs that also use glutamine as a nitrogen donor, and required allosteric activation by N-acetylglutamate (AGA), a sensor of excess amino acids. The recent availability of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe expression system for hCPS allowed us to utilize protein engineering approaches to elucidate the distinctive hCPS properties. Although the site of AGA interaction is not defined, it is known that the binding of AGA to CPS leads to a conformational change in which a pair of cysteine side chains become proximate and can then be selectively induced to undergo disulfide bonding. We analyzed the response of hCPS cysteine mutants to thiol-specific reagents and identified Cys-1327 and Cys-1337 as the AGA-responsive proximate cysteines. Possibly two of the features unique to urea-specific CPSs, relative to other CPSs (the conserved Cys-1327/Cys-1337 pair and the occurrence at very high concentrations in the liver mitochondrial matrix) co-evolved to provide buffering against reactive oxygen species. Reciprocal mutation analysis of Escherichia coli CPS (eCPS), creating P909C and G919C and establishing the ability of these engineered cysteine residues to share a disulfide bond, indicated an eCPS conformational change at least partly similar to the hCPS conformational change induced by AGA. These findings strongly suggested an alternative eCPS conformation relative to the single crystal conformation thus far identified."
