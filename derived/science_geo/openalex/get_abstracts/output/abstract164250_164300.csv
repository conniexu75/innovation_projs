https://openalex.org/W2053073281,"Glucose homeostasis depends on insulin responsiveness in target tissues, most importantly, muscle and liver. The critical initial steps in insulin action include phosphorylation of scaffolding proteins and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These early events lead to activation of the serine-threonine protein kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B. We show that mice deficient in Akt2 are impaired in the ability of insulin to lower blood glucose because of defects in the action of the hormone on liver and skeletal muscle. These data establish Akt2 as an essential gene in the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis."

Here, we describe an isoform of KIF1B, KIF1Bbeta, that is distinct from KIF1B in its cargo binding domain. KIF1B knockout mice die at birth from apnea due to nervous system defects. Death of knockout neurons in culture can be rescued by expression of the beta isoform. The KIF1B heterozygotes have a defect in transporting synaptic vesicle precursors and suffer from progressive muscle weakness similar to human neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A was previously mapped to an interval containing KIF1B. We show that CMT2A patients contain a loss-of-function mutation in the motor domain of the KIF1B gene. This is clear indication that defects in axonal transport due to a mutated motor protein can underlie human peripheral neuropathy."

The desired geometric operations are obtained by driving the quantum system to undergo appropriate adiabatic cyclic evolutions. Our implementation of the all-geometric quantum computation is based on laser manipulation of a set of trapped ions. An all-geometric approach, apart from its fundamental interest, offers a possible method for robust quantum computation."
https://openalex.org/W1977141229,"Listeria monocytogenes is responsible for severe food-borne infections, but the mechanisms by which bacteria cross the intestinal barrier are unknown. Listeria monocytogenes expresses a surface protein, internalin, that interacts with a host receptor, E-cadherin, to promote entry into human epithelial cells. Murine E-cadherin, in contrast to guinea pig E-cadherin, does not interact with internalin, excluding the mouse as a model for addressing internalin function in vivo. In guinea pigs and transgenic mice expressing human E-cadherin, internalin was found to mediate invasion of enterocytes and crossing of the intestinal barrier. These results illustrate how relevant animal models for human infections can be generated."

https://openalex.org/W2022285707,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling from the posterior zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) is the primary determinant of anterior-posterior polarity in the vertebrate limb field. An active signal is produced by an autoprocessing reaction that covalently links cholesterol to the N-terminal signaling moiety (N-Shh(p)), tethering N-Shh(p) to the cell membrane. We have addressed the role played by this lipophilic modification in Shh-mediated patterning of mouse digits. Both the distribution and activity of N-Shh(p) indicate that N-Shh(p) acts directly over a few hundred microns. In contrast, N-Shh, a form that lacks cholesterol, retains similar biological activity to N-Shh(p), but signaling is posteriorly restricted. Thus, cholesterol modification is essential for the normal range of signaling. It also appears to be necessary for appropriate modulation of signaling by the Shh receptor, Ptc1."
https://openalex.org/W2171387330,"Photosynthetic carbon assimilation is commonly invoked as the cause of calcium carbonate precipitation in cyanobacterial biofilms that results in the formation of calcareous stromatolites. However, biofilm calcification patterns in recent lakes and simulation of photosynthetically induced rise in calcium carbonate supersaturation demonstrate that this mechanism applies only in settings low in dissolved inorganic carbon and high in calcium. Taking into account paleo-partial pressure curves for carbon dioxide, we show that Phanerozoic oceans sustaining calcified cyanobacteria must have had considerably higher calcium concentrations than oceans of today. In turn, the enigmatic lack of calcified cyanobacteria in stromatolite-bearing Precambrian sequences can now be explained as a result of high dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2043835841,"The delivery of soluble hydrolases to lysosomes is mediated by the cation-independent and cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The cytosolic tails of both receptors contain acidic-cluster-dileucine signals that direct sorting from the trans-Golgi network to the endosomal-lysosomal system. We found that these signals bind to the VHS domain of the Golgi-localized, gamma-ear-containing, ARF-binding proteins (GGAs). The receptors and the GGAs left the trans-Golgi network on the same tubulo-vesicular carriers. A dominant-negative GGA mutant blocked exit of the receptors from the trans-Golgi network. Thus, the GGAs appear to mediate sorting of the mannose 6-phosphate receptors at the trans-Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W2102230270,"We have discovered an early mitotic inhibitor, Emi1, which regulates mitosis by inhibiting the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC). Emi1 is a conserved F box protein containing a zinc binding region essential for APC inhibition. Emi1 accumulates before mitosis and is ubiquitylated and destroyed in mitosis, independent of the APC. Emi1 immunodepletion from cycling Xenopus extracts strongly delays cyclin B accumulation and mitotic entry, whereas nondestructible Emi1 stabilizes APC substrates and causes a mitotic block. Emi1 binds the APC activator Cdc20, and Cdc20 can rescue an Emi1-induced block to cyclin B destruction. Our results suggest that Emi1 regulates progression through early mitosis by preventing premature APC activation, and may help explain the well-known delay between cyclin B/Cdc2 activation and cyclin B destruction."

https://openalex.org/W2098509515,"The GGAs are a multidomain protein family implicated in protein trafficking between the Golgi and endosomes. Here, the VHS domain of GGA2 was shown to bind to the acidic cluster-dileucine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). Receptors with mutations in this motif were defective in lysosomal enzyme sorting. The hinge domain of GGA2 bound clathrin, suggesting that GGA2 could be a link between cargo molecules and clathrin-coated vesicle assembly. Thus, GGA2 binding to the CI-MPR is important for lysosomal enzyme targeting."

https://openalex.org/W2088942336,"The frizzled receptors, which mediate development and display seven hydrophobic, membrane-spanning segments, are cell membrane-localized. We constructed a chimeric receptor with the ligand-binding and transmembrane segments from the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) and the cytoplasmic domains from rat Frizzled-1 (Rfz1). Stimulation of mouse F9 clones expressing the chimera (beta2AR-Rfz1) with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol stimulated stabilization of beta-catenin, activation of a beta-catenin-sensitive promoter, and formation of primitive endoderm. The response was blocked by inactivation of pertussis toxin-sensitive, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and by depletion of Galphaq and Galphao. Thus, G proteins are elements of Wnt/Frizzled-1 signaling to the beta-catenin-lymphoid-enhancer factor (LEF)-T cell factor (Tcf) pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1979825058,"Embryos have evolved various strategies to confine the action of secreted signals. Using an HRP-Wingless fusion protein to track the fate of endocytosed Wingless, we show that degradation by targeting to lysosomes is one such strategy. Wingless protein is specifically degraded at the posterior of each stripe of wingless transcription, even under conditions of overexpression. If lysosomal degradation is compromised genetically or chemically, excess Wingless accumulates and ectopic signaling ensues. In the wild-type, Wingless degradation is slower at the anterior than at the posterior. This follows in part from the segmental activation of signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor, which accelerates Wingless degradation at the posterior, thus leading to asymmetrical Wingless signaling along the anterior-posterior axis."
https://openalex.org/W2066944772,"Plant growth and development are regulated through coordinated interactions between light and phytohormones. Here, we demonstrate that a dark-induced small G protein, pea Pra2, regulates a variant cytochrome P450 that catalyzes C-2 hydroxylation in brassinosteroid biosynthesis. The cytochrome P450 is dark-induced and predominantly expressed in the rapidly elongating zone of etiolated pea epicotyls, where Pra2 is also most abundant. Transgenic plants with reduced Pra2 exhibit a dark-specific dwarfism, which is completely rescued by exogenous brassinolide. Overexpression of the cytochrome P450 results in enhanced hypocotyl growth even in the light, which phenocopies the etiolated hypocotyls. We therefore propose that Pra2 and its orthologs are molecular mediators for the cross-talk between light and brassinosteroids in the etiolation process in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2041065459,"In many animal species, the amount of care provided by parents is determined through a complex interaction of offspring signals and responses by parents to those signals. As predicted by honest signaling theory, we show that in the burrower bug, Sehirus cinctus, maternal provisioning responds to experimental manipulations of offspring condition. Despite this predicted environmental influence, we find evidence from two cross-foster experiments that variation in maternal care also stems from two distinct genetic sources: variation among offspring in their ability to elicit care and variation among parents in their response to offspring signals. Furthermore, as predicted by maternal-offspring coadaptation theory, offspring signaling is negatively genetically correlated with maternal provisioning."
https://openalex.org/W2075759428,"Little is known about the phenotypic consequences of global climate change, despite the excellent Pleistocene fossil record of many taxa. We used morphological measurements from extant and Pleistocene populations of a marine gastropod (Acanthinucella spirata) in conjunction with mitochondrial DNA sequence variation from living populations to determine how populations responded phenotypically to Pleistocene climatic changes. Northern populations show little sequence variation as compared to southern populations, a pattern consistent with a recent northward range expansion. These recently recolonized northern populations also contain shell morphologies that are absent in extant southern populations and throughout the Pleistocene fossil record. Thus, contrary to traditional expectations that morphological evolution should occur largely within Pleistocene refugia, our data show that geographical range shifts in response to climatic change can lead to significant morphological evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2078245915,Complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21) is an important receptor that amplifies B lymphocyte activation by bridging the innate and adaptive immune systems. CR2 ligands include complement C3d and Epstein-Barr virus glycoprotein 350/220. We describe the x-ray structure of this CR2 domain in complex with C3d at 2.0 angstroms. The structure reveals extensive main chain interactions between C3d and only one short consensus repeat (SCR) of CR2 and substantial SCR side-side packing. These results provide a detailed understanding of receptor-ligand interactions in this protein family and reveal potential target sites for molecular drug design.

Paralititan stromeri is the first tetrapod reported from Bahariya since 1935. Its 1.69-meter-long humerus is longer than that of any known Cretaceous sauropod. The autochthonous scavenged skeleton was preserved in mangrove deposits, raising the possibility that titanosaurids and their predators habitually entered such environments."

https://openalex.org/W2113132658,"Selenocysteine is a rare amino acid in protein that is encoded by UGA with the requirement of a downstream mRNA stem-loop structure, the selenocysteine insertion sequence element. To detect selenoproteins in Drosophila, the entire genome was analyzed with a novel program that searches for selenocysteine insertion sequence elements, followed by selenoprotein gene signature analyses. This computational screen and subsequent metabolic labeling with 75Se and characterization of selenoprotein mRNA expression resulted in identification of three selenoproteins: selenophosphate synthetase 2 and novel G-rich and BthD selenoproteins that had no homology to known proteins. To assess a biological role for these proteins, a simple chemically defined medium that supports growth of adult Drosophila and requires selenium supplementation for optimal survival was devised. Flies survived on this medium supplemented with 10−8 to 10−6mselenium or on the commonly used yeast-based complete medium at about twice the rate as those on a medium without selenium or with >10−6m selenium. This effect correlated with changes in selenoprotein mRNA expression. The number of eggs laid by Drosophila was reduced approximately in half in the chemically defined medium compared with the same medium supplemented with selenium. The data provide evidence that dietary selenium deficiency shortens, while supplementation of the diet with selenium normalizes the Drosophila life span by a process that may involve the newly identified selenoproteins.

It has anticarcinogenic and antiviral properties, a role in reproductive function, a role in preventing heart disease, and a role in development (reviewed in Ref. 1Gladyshev V.N. Martin-Romero F.J. Xu X.-M. Kumaraswamy E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Lee B.J. Recent Res. Dev. Biochem. 1999; 1: 145-167Google Scholar). This element has been also implicated in enhancing immune function and in slowing the progression of AIDS in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients (1Gladyshev V.N. Martin-Romero F.J. Xu X.-M. Kumaraswamy E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Lee B.J. Recent Res. Dev. Biochem. 1999; 1: 145-167Google Scholar). At optimal and suboptimal levels in the diet, selenium occurs in animals primarily as selenocysteine (Sec)1 in Sec-containing proteins. A deficiency in dietary selenium results in decreased levels of selenoproteins, thus compromising biological processes that are maintained by these proteins. Sec is the 21st naturally occurring amino acid in protein (reviewed in Refs. 2Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 3Bock A. Biofactors. 2000; 11: 77-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 4Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N.

It has its own tRNA, which is first aminoacylated with serine. Serine serves as the backbone for Sec synthesis on its tRNA, and the tRNA is therefore designated tRNA[Ser]Sec. Sec also has its own code word, UGA, which serves a dual function of dictating Sec or the cessation of protein synthesis. The feature that distinguishes UGA as a Sec codon is the presence of a stem-loop structure downstream of UGA called a Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element (2Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the SECIS element is located in the 3′-untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNAs (2Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and a specific factor, the SECIS-binding protein (SBP2), recognizes the SECIS element for insertion of Sec into protein (5Copeland P.R. Fletcher J.E. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Driscoll D.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a second factor, the specific Sec elongation protein (EFsec), recognizes Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec, and the resulting complex between EFsec-Sec-tRNA-SBP2 governs the donation of Sec to the nascent selenopeptide in response to UGA (6Tujebajeva R.M. Copeland P.R. Xu X.-M. Carlson B.A. Harney J.W. Driscoll D.M. Hatfield D.L. Berry M.J. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 7Fagegaltier D. Hubert N. Yamada K. Mizutani T. Carbon P. Krol A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In eubacteria, a single factor, SELB, recognizes both the SECIS element, which is located immediately downstream of UGA, and Sec-tRNA[Ser]Secfor Sec insertion (3Bock A. Biofactors. 2000; 11: 77-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), while in archaea, the factors required for Sec insertion resemble those found in eukaryotes (8Rother M. Wilting R. Bock A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Seventeen selenoproteins are currently known in mammals (9Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The function of most of these selenoproteins is not known, and thus many of the beneficial effects of selenium remain elusive. However, the number of selenoproteins appears to be fewer in lower eukaryotes, and their identification will help elucidate functions of specific eukaryotic selenoproteins. Among lower eukaryotes, Drosophila emerges as a very useful organism to characterize roles of selenium in biology and medicine. Fruit flies have been used as a model organism for studying a variety of maladies in humans, including cancer (10Bilder D. Li M. Perrimon N. Science. 2000; 289: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), neurological disorders (11Phillips J.P. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Boulianne G.L. Kirby K. Hilliker A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8574-8578Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the aging process (12Tower J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 118: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Drosophila has also provided a powerful tool in the investigation of genetics (13Vernooy S.Y. Copeland J. Ghaboosi N. Griffin E.E. Yoo S.J. Hay B.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F69-F76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and development (14Wieschaus E. Nusslein-Volhard C. Kluding H. Dev. Biol. 1984; 104: 172-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Several studies support the idea that Drosophila may also serve as a model system for studying many parameters of selenium metabolism. For example, two groups have detected a gene encoding a homolog of selenophosphate synthetase (15Persson B.C. Bock A. Jackle H. Vorbruggen G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Alsina B. Serras F. Baguña J. Corominas M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The gene has a role in imaginal disc morphogenesis, brain development, and cell proliferation (16Alsina B. Serras F. Baguña J. Corominas M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Alsina B. Corominas M. Berry M.J. Baguña J. Serras F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2875-2884PubMed Google Scholar), although studies thus far have failed to detect selenophosphate synthetase activity (15Persson B.C. Bock A. Jackle H. Vorbruggen G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that two forms of selenophosphate synthetase, designated SPS1 and SPS2, have been described in mammals (18Low S.C. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Kim I.Y. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zlotnik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15086-15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). SPS2 is a selenoprotein (20Guimaraes M.J. Peterson D. Vicari A. Cocks B.G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Ferrick D.A. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Zlotnik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15086-15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recently, the occurrence of a SPS2 homolog was described inDrosophila (21Hirosawa-Takamori M. Jackle H. Vorbruggen G. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), marking the first identification of a selenoprotein in this organism. Thus, Drosophila also has two selenophosphate synthetase forms, a homolog of SPS1 (18Low S.C. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Kim I.Y. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec has been isolated and sequenced from Drosophila, and the tRNA[Ser]Sec population has been analyzed (22Zhou X. Park S.I. Moustafa M.E. Carlson B.A. Crain P.F.

Computer algorithms were recently developed that are capable of identifying selenoprotein genes by searching for SECIS elements in nucleotide sequence data bases (9Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M.

In this study, we employed a more highly sophisticated computer approach to scan the recently sequenced Drosophila genome for the presence of selenoprotein genes. Only three genes were found. One of these encoded a homolog of SPS2 (20Guimaraes M.J. Peterson D. Vicari A. Cocks B.G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Ferrick D.A. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Zlotnik A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and two genes encoded novel selenoproteins. To analyze the role of selenium in the expression of these selenoproteins and in fly mortality, a chemically defined diet lacking selenium was devised. The addition of 10−8 to 10−6m selenium to the medium resulted in a longer life span than that on the same medium without selenium, indicating a role of dietary selenium in normalizing the life span ofDrosophila. [75Se]Selenite (1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from the University of Missouri Research Reactor; the RNAeasy purification kit was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA); Monloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase was from Ambion (Austin, TX); RNase-free DNase was from Promega (Madison, WI); Pwo DNA polymerase and CompleteTM inhibitor mixture were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; UltraPure low melting point agarose was from Life Technologies, Inc.; and Instant Drosophila Medium (127.95 g/liter corn meal, 22.38 g/liter brewers yeast, 73.89 g/liter glucose, 36.88 g/liter sucrose, 182.69 g/liter soybean fiber, and 1.21 g/literp-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester), Grace's insect medium (G-8142), sodium selenite, andp-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester were from Sigma. The Canton S. strain of Drosophila was obtained from Dr. Florence Davidson and used throughout this study. Total poly(A) RNA from adult, larvae, and embryo Drosophila (Canton S. strain) was purchased from CLONTECH. Chemically defined medium contained Grace's insect medium (15 ml/vial) and p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester (100 µl/ml of a 200 mg/ml solution). Low melting point agarose (0.45%) was added as the support matrix. Either no selenium or selenium at a final concentration of 10−8, 10−7, 10−6, 10−5, or 10−4m was also included. Newborn flies (70–75 flies/vial, and 8–10 vials for every experimental condition) were collected from complete medium (instant Drosophilamedium) and placed on the chemically defined medium with or without selenium supplementation or on complete medium. Flies were changed to fresh chemically defined medium every 3 days. Total tRNA was isolated from adultDrosophila, 0.005 A 260 units were loaded into each lane of a 15% TBE-urea polyacrylamide gel, the tRNA was electroblotted from developed gels onto nylon membranes, and filters were hybridized with an 188-bpDraIII–NdeI fragment encoding theDrosophila tRNA[Ser]Sec gene (22Zhou X.

Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). 2G. V. Kryukov, A. V. Lobanov, and V. N. Gladyshev, unpublished data. Candidate sequences that resembled eukaryotic SECIS elements (i.e.satisfied primary sequence and secondary structure consensus) were subjected to the free energy criterion, which allowed filtering predicted unstable structures. The sequence, structure, and energy parameters of the program that were used in the searches allowed identification of ∼90% (53 out of 59) selenoproteins from our collection of known eukaryotic selenoproteins and SECIS elements. This collection of natural SECIS elements from nine eukaryotes (human, mouse, rat, bovine, zebrafish, macaque, Ovis, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Dictyostelium) was used to tune the SECISearch program. The annotated version of the Drosophila melanogaster genome was then used to determine the location of each candidate SECIS element. The sequences that fell to the 5′-untranslated region, introns, or coding regions of previously predicted proteins on either DNA strand were discarded. Finally, ORFs closest to the predicted candidate SECIS elements were manually analyzed with MSGS criteria (9Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The principal component of these criteria was BLAST-based searches for homologs in Drosophilaor other eukaryotes that contained Cys codons (TGC or TGT) in place of Sec-encoding TGA codons in Drosophila selenoproteins. Two possibilities were considered for each candidate sequence. 1) If the ORF was terminated with TGA, we tested whether this codon could encode a Sec residue. Such analysis resulted in identification of a 12-kDa selenoprotein (G-rich), in which Sec was the C-terminal penultimate residue. 2) All candidate ORFs were also analyzed for the possible extension of their N-terminal sequences that may include in-frame TGA codons. These analyses identified SPS2 and a 28-kDa selenoprotein (BthD). Total RNA was extracted from adult flies, purified with an RNAeasy kit, and treated with RNase-free DNase, and the reverse transcription (RT) reaction was carried out with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and an oligo(dT)18 primer. A portion of the RT product (typically 1 µl) was used for PCR amplification with Pwo polymerase using specific primers for each gene. Forward primers contained an EcoRI digestion site, and reverse primers contained a BamHI site for cloning PCR products in pUC19. Primers for each cDNA were: SPS2, forward (5′-CGGAATTCCGTAGAAATTCGCGCACAATG-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGGATCCTCGTTAATCATCAAAATTATC-3′); 28 kDa, forward (5′-CGGAATTCCGATTCTGATTACTTTAGGATCATGC-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGGATCCCGATATATTTTGTAATAACAATGCTC-3′); 12 kDa, forward (5′-CGGAATTCCGCCTGAGGATAGCGTGGCGCCATGG-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGGATCCCGGAAGCAGCGACCCAGGAATCAGTG-3′); SPS1, forward (5′-CGGAATTCGCAAACCTATAAAGCAAGATG-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGGATCCCTGAATGTAGCAGCCGTTACG-3′); and SBP2, forward (5′-CGGAATTCCACTAAGAATCCACAATAAATG-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGGATCCTTACTCACTTTCGCCGGGGC-3′). Quantification of mRNA expression was accomplished by RT-PCR using a competitive strategy. The exogenous standard (competitor) was constructed by creating a small deletion in the cloned cDNA. Cloned SPS2 cDNA was digested with EcoRV and BsgI and religated in the same vector, BthD cDNA was digested withBstXI and BstEII, G-rich cDNA was digested with EcoRV and XhoI, SPS1 cDNA was digested with NcoI, and SBP2 cDNA was digested withEcoRV and BsgI. All cloned cDNAs were religated in the same vector. Using 1 µl of the RT product as template, different amounts of competitors were added to the PCR mix to calculate the relative amount of each gene after amplification. PCR products were separated in agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and scanned using a Molecular Imager FX System (Bio-Rad). Signals were quantified by volumetric integration of raw data using the Quantity One Software following the instructions of the manufacturer. The amount of each PCR product was also compared with the amount of RT-amplified cDNA for the constitutive gene rp49(forward primer, 5′-ATGACCATCCGCCCAGCATAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTTGGCGCGCTCGACAATCTC-3′) in the same sample under the same experimental conditions. Total poly(A) RNA from adult Drosophila was electrophoresed on formaldehyde-agarose gels, and the RNA was transferred onto nylon membranes and hybridized with a 550-bpEcoRI-BamHI fragment encoding a portion of the G-rich gene, a 900-bp EcoRI-XhoI fragment encoding a portion of the BthD gene, or a 450-bpBamHI-EcoRV fragment encoding a portion of the SPS2 gene. Filters were stripped and reprobed with a 550-bpEcoRI-HindIII fragment encoding a portion of the ribosomal protein gene (rp49) gene as a control, since RP49 is constitutively expressed at all stages of development. Flies maintained on complete and chemically defined medium with and without selenium supplementation were transferred to defined medium without selenium and labeled with 100 µCi of 75Se for 24 h. Protein extracts were prepared from 30–35 flies using radioimmune precipitation buffer (0.3m NaCl, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4); 40 µg of total protein from each sample were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel; and the gels were run, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager screens for 48 h. The entireDrosophila genome was analyzed with an advanced version of SECISearch, a computer program that identifies SECIS elements in large nucleotide sequence data bases, including completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes (9Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This program entails searching genomic DNA for the primary SECIS element consensus sequence, followed by analyses of their secondary structure and then an evaluation of the free energy of identified candidate SECIS structures (9Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Parameters of the program were set such that the absolute majority of known eukaryotic selenoprotein genes could be recognized. These automatic analyses of the Drosophila genome were followed by manual analyses of selected sequences using MSGS criteria (9Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) 3G. V. Kryukov and V. N. Gladyshev, unpublished data. and BLAST searches to identify possible EST or non-redundant sequences as well as ORFs within these sequences. In particular, we searched for homologs that contained Cys residues in place of putative Sec residues inDrosophila ORFs. Three ORFs encoding proteins of 12, 28, and 43 kDa were detected that contained in frame TGA codons predicted to encode Sec (Table I). Genes for these proteins (Fig. 1 A) have three or four exons separated by small introns with each exon containing a coding sequence. SECIS elements in the three selenoprotein genes (Fig.1 B) contained all features characteristic of eukaryotic SECIS elements, including the quartet of non-Watson-Crick-interacting nucleotides UGAN … NGAN preceded by an unpaired A as well as an unpaired AA motif in a bulge separated from the Quartet by an 11–12 nucleotide stem (Fig. 1 B).Table IIn silico analysis of the Drosophila genome for the presence of selenoprotein genesPattern criteria applied1-aNumber of candidate sequences after the initial analysis of the entire Drosophila genome for primary sequences and secondary structures.Energy criteria applied1-bNumber of candidate sequences after application of the free energy criterion.Location criteria applied1-cNumber of candidate SECIS elements that satisfied location criteria (not present in 5′-untranslated region, introns, or coding regions of known Drosophilaproteins).MSGS criteria applied1-dNumber of selenoproteins that satisfied MSGS criteria (9).49081791431-a Number of candidate sequences after the initial analysis of the entire Drosophila genome for primary sequences and secondary structures.1-b Number of candidate sequences after application of the free energy criterion.1-c Number of candidate SECIS elements that satisfied location criteria (not present in 5′-untranslated region, introns, or coding regions of known Drosophilaproteins).1-d Number of selenoproteins that satisfied MSGS criteria (9Kryukov G.V.

Open table in a new tab The 43-kDa selenoprotein was homologous to SPS2 (see also Ref. 21Hirosawa-Takamori M. Jackle H. Vorbruggen G. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a protein that was previously discovered in mammals (20Guimaraes M.J. Peterson D. Vicari A. Cocks B.G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Ferrick D.A. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Zlotnik A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15086-15091Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Like mammalian SPS2, this Drosophila protein has a conserved Sec residue in the N-terminal portion of the protein. Two other proteins have no homology to known proteins. The 28-kDa protein, designated BthD, has a CXXU motif (i.e. Cys and Sec are separated by two residues) in the N-terminal portion, similar to that found in the mammalian selenoproteins SelT and SelW. Interestingly, the 12-kDa protein, designated G-rich, contained a C-terminal penultimate Sec residue. This was similar to mammalian thioredoxin reductases, which also contain the C-terminal penultimate Sec. Homology searches revealed additional Cys-containingDrosophila homologs of 12- and 28-kDa selenoproteins (Fig.2), consistent with MSGS criteria (9Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) for selenoprotein genes. Furthermore, Cys-containing and Sec-containing homologs of 12- and 28-kDa selenoproteins were found in other eukaryotes including higher plants (Cys) and vertebrates (Sec) (data not shown). Expression of the three selenoprotein mRNAs was initially assessed by the presence of multiple DrosophilaESTs and subsequently by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses (see below). The Drosophila genome was also screened by homology search analyses for the presence of fruit fly selenoproteins homologous to known eukaryotic selenoproteins. However, no additional selenoproteins were detected by this approach. Dietary selenium is known to regulate expression levels of selenium-containing proteins. To assess the possible significance of the newly discovered selenoproteins and, in particular, their role in the life span of Drosophila, we devised a chemically defined diet that supported the growth of adult flies. In developing the diet, the following considerations were taken into account. 1) We reasoned that the yeast-based medium may not be sufficient to obtain low selenium levels in the diet, especially if the requirement for selenium is low in Drosophila. This is because selenium can enter sulfur pathways and is present as a contaminant in a number of compounds used in the medium. It should be noted that even when selenium-deficient Torula yeast was used in studies on rats and mice, many selenoproteins, especially those expressed in the endocrine organs, were apparently expressed in sufficient levels to maintain essential processes. Thus, a simple diet for Drosophila was required that would eliminate as many selenium-containing, contaminant compounds as possible. 2) In addition to designing a medium that is chemically defined (to be able to regulate the amount of selenium intake by Drosophila), it was important to obtain a different support matrix for the medium, since the agar routinely used for this purpose contained selenium. We therefore used a highly purified agarose as matrix (see “Experimental Procedures”). 3) We considered and/or tested a number of supplement compounds and growth conditions that could be sufficient to maintain the flies for a period long enough to assess their life span characteristics. For example, we tested several concentrations of a regular agarose (0.4–2%) as a matrix for the media. However, the only kind of agarose that could be used without affecting normal life in flies was low melting point agarose. We also tested the survival of flies using a selenium-deficient Torula yeast extract. This extract failed to support life of adult flies even after supplementation with Grace's vitamin solution and a lipid mixture. As a result of numerous attempts to find a diet that was dependent on selenium, we found that Grace's medium supplemented with p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester provided a simple, chemically defined medium that supported growth of adult flies and manifested a growth response to selenium. Flies could be maintained on this medium without any other supplementation for more than 5 weeks. The life span of flies maintained on the chemically defined medium with varying levels of selenium was compared with that of flies maintained on the yeast-based complete medium routinely used for growing Drosophila (Fig.3). Selenium levels varied from none to 10−8, 10−7, 10−6, 10−5, and 10−4m. Flies maintained on defined medium without selenium or with 10−5m selenium died at more than twice the rate of flies maintained on complete medium or on defined medium with 10−8, 10−7"
https://openalex.org/W2034716886,"Many in vivo substrates of Src family tyrosine kinases possess sequences conforming to Src homology 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) domain-binding motifs. One such substrate is p130Cas, a protein that is hyperphosphorylated in v-Src transformed cells. Cas contains a substrate domain consisting of 15 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, C- and N-terminal polyproline regions fitting the consensus sequence for SH3 domain ligands, and a YDYV motif that binds the Src SH2 domain when phosphorylated. In an effort to understand the mechanisms of processive phosphorylation, we have explored the regions of Cas necessary for interaction with Src using the yeast two-hybrid system. Mutations in the SH2 domain-binding region of Cas or the Src SH2 domain have little effect in Cas-Src complex formation or phosphorylation. However, disruption of the C-terminal polyproline region of Cas completely abolishes interaction between the two proteins and results in impaired phosphorylation of Cas. Kinetic analyses using purified proteins indicated that multisite phosphorylation of Cas by Src follows a processive rather than a distributive mechanism. Furthermore, the kinetic studies show that there are two properties of the polyproline region of Cas that are important in enhancing substrate phosphorylation. First, the C-terminal polyproline serves to activate Src kinases through the process of SH3 domain displacement. Second, this region aids in anchoring the kinase to Cas to facilitate processive phosphorylation of the substrate domain.

Src homology viral polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild type optical density × 10−3 binding domain Phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues is central to a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways. The enzymes responsible for this modification, tyrosine kinases, occur as transmembrane receptors or nonreceptor cytoplasmic proteins. The uncontrolled signaling resulting from the deregulation of tyrosine kinase activity has been implicated in the onset and progression of a variety of human malignancies (1Biscardi J.S. Tice D.A. Parsons S.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1999; 76: 61-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, considerable interest exists in the study of tyrosine kinase substrate selection, regulation of activity, and biological function. In vitro studies using peptide libraries have helped to determine the substrate specificities of several tyrosine kinases (2Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Poner B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 3Till J.H.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14825-14833Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the catalytic domains of tyrosine kinases possess less rigorous substrate specificity than those of Ser/Thr kinases (2Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Poner B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). However, cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases have an array of accessory domains implicated in protein-protein interactions that can further influence substrate selection. Src family tyrosine kinases are organized into a set of modular domains: unique, SH3,1 SH2, and catalytic. The catalytic domain is responsible for transferring phosphate from ATP onto tyrosine residues of substrate proteins. The noncatalytic SH2, SH3, and unique domains each have multiple roles that are important for the regulation of cellular kinase function. The SH2 and SH3 domains regulate kinase activity by maintaining the catalytic domain in an inactive conformation. In addition, the SH2 and SH3 domains bind to protein substrates and aid in the localization of the kinase to specific subcellular compartments. The fact that many in vivo substrates of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases contain SH2 and/or SH3 domain-binding motifs supports the notion that specificity arises outside the catalytic domain (see Refs. 5Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar and 6Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar for reviews). The SH2 domain binds phosphotyrosine-containing sequences with high affinity and specificity (7Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar). One of the first indications of the ability of SH2 domains to modulate tyrosine kinase substrate specificity came from the observation that altering the domain results in impaired transformation efficiency. For example, deletion of the SH2 domain of the tyrosine kinases v-Abl and v-Src causes a loss in the transforming activity with no reduction in kinase activity (5Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 8Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,9Tian M. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in cells transfected with chimeric tyrosine kinases containing heterologous SH2 domains is dictated by the specificity of the SH2 domain, not by that of the catalytic domains used in the chimeras (8Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The involvement of the SH2 domain in directing substrate specificity is apparent in a process termed processive phosphorylation (10Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this process, the kinase phosphorylates a site in the substrate that becomes a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain. Interaction between this site and the SH2 domain of the kinase facilitates phosphorylation of subsequent tyrosines in the substrate. In support of this notion, we have shown previously that Src kinases phosphorylate peptide substrates containing SH2-binding sequences 10-fold more efficiently than controls (11Pellicena P. Stowell K.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Examples of the role of the SH2 domain in processive phosphorylation include phosphorylation of RNA polymerase by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Abl (12Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of ITAM motifs in the ζ chain of the T cell receptor by the Src family kinase Lck (13Lewis L.A. Chung C.D. Chen J. Parnes J.R. Moran M. Patel V.P. Miceli M.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2292-2300PubMed Google Scholar). By virtue of their phosphotyrosine binding abilities, SH2 domains can coordinate a sequence of phosphorylation events when multiple target sites are present in the same substrate. Processive phosphorylation can conceivably arise from polyproline-SH3 interactions as well. The SH3 domains of Src family kinases recognize proline-rich sequences that can adopt a polyproline type II helix. An example of enhanced phosphorylation involving SH3-polyproline interactions involves the actin filament-associated protein AFAP-110 and Src. The integrity of the polyproline motif in AFAP-110 is necessary for stable complex formation with Src. Impaired phosphorylation in vivo is observed in a mutant lacking this polyproline. Thus, SH3-mediated interactions facilitate the presentation of AFAP-110 for tyrosine phosphorylation by Src (14Guappone A.C. Flynn D.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 75: 243-252Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because both the SH2 and SH3 domains are involved in the intramolecular inhibition of Src, substrates possessing binding motifs for these domains could activate the kinase. The majority of Src substrates identified to date contain SH3/2 binding motifs, or both (4Wu J. Ma Q.N. Lam K.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14825-14833Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). p130Cas (Crk-associated substrate) is one such substrate. Cas belongs to a family of structurally related proteins that also includes Hef and Sin (see Ref. 15O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar for review). It was identified originally as a prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in cells transformed by the v-src or v-crkoncogenes (16Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Cas contains an N-terminal SH3 domain that is responsible for its localization into focal adhesions and interacts with the focal adhesion kinase FAK (Fig. 1A) (17Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The central “substrate domain” of Cas contains 15 potential phosphorylation sites with the consensus YXXP. Nine of these motifs are potential Crk SH2 domain-binding sites (7Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar). Cas also has N- and C-terminal proline-rich sequences that could potentially interact with the SH3 domain of Src. Finally, when phosphorylated, Tyr-668 (in the sequence pYDYV) fits the consensus sequence for high affinity Src SH2 domain binding. Both Tyr-668 and the C-terminal polyproline sequence of Cas are known to be binding sites for Src (18Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 19Burnham M.R. Harte M.T. Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Bouton A.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2467-2472PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations in this region result in impaired phosphorylation of Casin vivo (18Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The exact biological function of Cas is still unclear. Cas undergoes rapid phosphorylation after mitogenic stimulation and in response to fibronectin attachment via integrin receptors (20Petruzzelli L. Takami M. Herrera R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7796-7801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Ojaniemi M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25993-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Nakamura I. Jimi E. Duong L.T. Sasaki T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11144-11149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in processes as diverse as cell migration, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and signal transduction by a variety of transmembrane receptors (15O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The modular nature of Cas suggests its involvement in the creation of multiprotein complexes, and as such, it has been proposed to act as a docking intermediary during the formation of cytoskeleton- dependent signaling networks. In principle, phosphorylation of Cas by Src could proceed by either a processive or nonprocessive (distributive) mechanism. In the processive mechanism, Src would remain bound to Cas during multiple phosphorylation events. In the nonprocessive mechanism, Src would dissociate from its substrate after each phosphorylation event. Because Cas contains 15 potential phosphorylation sites in the substrate domain, a processive mechanism would confer speed and efficiency to the reaction. Kinetic experiments with a peptide model system indicate that Src can phosphorylate substrates by a processive mechanism (11Pellicena P. Stowell K.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15325-15328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,23Scott M.P. Miller W.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14531-14537Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Given the existence of multiple complementary domains in both kinase and substrate, the phosphorylation of Cas by Src is likely to be complex. The mechanistic details of Cas phosphorylation and the role of each domain or motif have not been examined closely. In this study, we show that the C-terminal polyproline sequence of Cas is the primary region involved in complex formation between Cas and Src. This sequence not only serves to anchor kinase and substrate, allowing processive phosphorylation, but it also serves as a kinase activator through the process of SH3 domain displacement. Cas and related Src substrates therefore play a role in directing their own phosphorylation. The antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The monoclonal anti-p130Cas antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Expression and purification of C-terminally phosphorylated (down-regulated) Hck has been described previously (24Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Briefly, human Hck comprising the SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains was coexpressed with CSK in a baculovirus expression system. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail on Tyr-527 was verified by mass spectrometry. Autophosphorylation of Y416 (c-Src numbering) was performed by incubation of the enzyme (5 mg/ml) on ice for 1 h in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5/20 mmMgCl2) in the presence of 2 mm ATP (25Moarefi I.

The autophosphorylated enzyme was then diluted in kinase assay buffer and used for activity measurements. Full-length v-Src was produced using a baculovirus vector in Sf9 cells and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, as described (26Garcia P. Shoelson S.E. George S.T. Hinds D.A. Goldberg A.R.

In this assay, the production of ADP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH and measured as a reduction in absorbance at 340 nm. Reactions were carried at 30 °C in 500 µl of buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.28 mm NADH, 89 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 124 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and the indicated amount of the peptide substrate AEEEIYGEFEAKKKKG (2Songyang Z.

Site-directed mutagenesis was accomplished using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene following manufacturer recommendations. All the mutations introduced were verified by DNA sequencing on an ABI373 automated DNA sequencer. The yeast expression vectors used in the yeast two-hybrid studies were a gift from Dr. James Bliska (State University of New York at Stony Brook). pBDMI vectors encode the binding domain of GAL4 and carry the marker TRP1. pADMI vectors encode the activation domain of GAL4 and carry the markerLEU2. pADMI-Cas encodes full-length rat Cas fused to the activation domain. pADMI-Cas/Src additionally coexpresses an active form of c-Src (G2E, Y416F, Y527F) (29Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar). The short form of rat Caswas subcloned from the vector pADMI-Cas (a generous gift of James Bliska, State University of New York at Stony Brook) as aBamHI/NotI fragment into pFastBac HTb (Life Technologies, Inc.) to produce N-terminally histidine-tagged proteins in the baculovirus expression system. Cas mutants CasY668F and CasPPX were generated by site-directed mutagenesis performed directly on pFastBac HTb-Cas or pADMI-Cas vectors. The forward and reverse primers used to generate CasY668F were GGGGGTTGGATGGAGGACTTTGACTACGTTCATCTGC and GCAGATGAACGTAGTCAAAGTCCTCCATCCAACCCCC, respectively. To obtain CasPPX, the C-terminal polyproline sequence in Cas RPLPSPPKF was mutated to RSLGSPGKF using the forward and reverse primers CCAGTCACGCTCTCTAGGCTCACCTGGAAAGTTCACCTCCC and GGGAGGTGAACTTTCCAGGTGAGCCTAGAGAGCGTGACTGG, respectively. v-src DNA from the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma virus (encoding amino acids 77–526, comprising the SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains of v-Src) was subcloned from a pGEX2T-SH3-SH2-catalytic domain plasmid (30Xu B. Miller W.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 158: 57-63PubMed Google Scholar) into pFastBacHTb (Life Technologies, Inc.) or pBDMI as aBamHI/EcoRI fragment. To make catalytically inactive v-Src (v-SrcKD) Lys-295 was mutated to arginine using the forward and reverse primers AGAGTGGCCATAAGGACTCTGAAGCCC and GGGCTTCAGAGTCCTTATGGCCACTCT, respectively. The SH2 domain-inactive v-Src (vSrcSH2D) was constructed by mutating R175K using the primers ACCTTCTTGGTCAAGGAGAGCGAGACG and CGTCTCGCTCTCCTTGACCAAGAAGGT, respectively. c-Src (G2E, Y416F, Y527F) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of plasmid pBTM116 (29Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar) using primers that introduced a BamHI site at the 5′ end and anEcoRI site at the 3′ end. The mammalian expression vector EBB-Crk encoding wild-type chicken Crk2 was a gift from Dr. Bruce Mayer (University of Connecticut Health Science Center). Crk was subcloned into pBDMI as a BamHI/NotI fragment. Because this construct generated a positive signal in the yeast two-hybrid assay in the absence of activation domain partners, we introduced a stop codon/XbaI site at codon 125 resulting in the production of the SH2 domain of Crk alone. The forward and reverse primers used were GTTTCCCGATCCATCTAGAACAGTGGCG and CGCCACTGTTCCTAGATGGATCGGGAAAC, respectively. Generation of recombinant baculovirus expressing N-terminal polyhistidine-tagged Cas and mutants was accomplished following manufacturer recommendations (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C in Excell 401 (JRH Biosciences) in the presence of 5% fetal calf serum (Cellgro) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 600 ml of cells at a density of 1.5–2 × 106 cells/ml were infected for a period of 72 h at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10 plaque-forming units/cell. The cells were centrifuged, rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −70 °C until needed. Purification of histidine-tagged Cas and mutants was carried out following the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System instruction manual (Life Technologies, Inc.) with some modifications. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell pellets corresponding to 600–1200-ml cultures of Sf9 cells were lysed twice in a French pressure cell at 650 p.s.i. in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min and dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The lysate was then applied to a column containing 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) followed by a 10-volume wash in buffer A. The column was then washed with 2 volumes of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 m KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The column was further washed with 2 volumes of buffer A prior to the elution of the protein. Elution was accomplished with buffer C (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm imidazole, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Depending on the purity of the fractions eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, in some cases Cas was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on an analytical MonoQ HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein eluted at ∼250 mm NaCl. Purified Cas was stored at −20 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The yield of Cas proteins varied from mutant to mutant. The overall yield/liter of Sf9 cells used was 2–3 mg for Cas wild type, 0.2 mg for CasY668F, and 6 mg for CasPPX. Yeast two-hybrid experiments were carried out using the yeast strain Y153 (MATa ura3-52leu2-3, 112 his3-200 ade2-101trp1-901 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL1::GAL1-lacZ). General procedures for yeast growth and maintenance are described elsewhere (31Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 32Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4796) Google Scholar). The yeast transformation was carried out using the lithium acetate method and 0.5 µg of plasmid (31Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Double transformants were selected on Leu-Trp SD-selective growth agar plates (31Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). β-galactosidase assays were performed in two ways. (i) In the filter assay colonies were transferred to a Whatman No. 1 filter, lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen, layered onto another filter presoaked with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside/Z buffer, and incubated at 30 °C until a blue color developed (31Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). (ii) For quantitation of β-galactosidase activity 3–5 independent transformants were grown in selective media until midlog phase. The cells were normalized by A 600 nm, and the same number of cells was used for each measurement. After lysis with chloroform/SDS, the activity of β-galactosidase was detected by spectrophotometrically measuring cleavage of the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-3-D-galactoside (31Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, purified recombinant Cas and v-Src were incubated in the presence of 0.1 µm [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 min on ice. This was followed by a chase containing 0.5 mmunlabeled ATP, and aliquots of the reaction were withdrawn at the specified times. The reactions were analyzed by SDS/PAGE on an 8% acrylamide/0.2% bis-acrylamide gel, and phosphorylated Cas was detected by autoradiography. To further separate intermediate products in some experiments, the reactions were analyzed by SDS/PAGE on a 9% acrylamide/0.075% bis-acrylamide gel. For experiments in which the total phosphorylation of Cas was monitored, the indicated amounts of CasWT and CasPPX were incubated in the presence of 150 nm His-v-Src and 0.25 mm[γ-32]ATP (140 cpm/pmol). The reactions were stopped at the indicated times by mixing with Laemmli Buffer and boiling and were analyzed by SDS/PAGE followed by autoradiography. To test the processive phosphorylation model, we first employed the yeast two-hybrid system. Yeast contain no true tyrosine kinases, therefore phosphotyrosine-dependent interactions can be attributed to the introduced kinase and not to endogenous yeast proteins. To test whether interactions between Cas and Src can occur in the yeast system, we constructed the following yeast expression vectors: (i) full-length Cas was fused to the activation domain of GAL4, and (ii) v-Src (or c-Src) was fused to the binding domain (BD) of GAL4. For v-Src, we used a portion of the gene encoding the SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains but lacking the unique region. Both forms of Src were fused to the C terminus of the binding domain of GAL4, and consequently the final fusion products were not myristoylated. Antiphosphotyrosine Western blots of yeast lysates showed elevated levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in yeast lysates expressing both forms of Src (data not shown), implying that our BD-Src fusion products were active. Cas and Src are capable of interacting in this system, as revealed by a filter-binding assay and by measuring the β-galactosidase activity of yeast lysates (Fig.1 B). Co-transfection of Cas with the empty binding domain vector results in undetectable β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the observed interaction between Cas and Src is specific. To test the importance of the Src SH2 domain in binding to Cas, we produced a Cas mutant (Y668F) in the site that binds the Src SH2 domain (Fig. 1 A). Mutation of this site or a mutation in the Src SH2 domain (R175K) that abrogates phosphotyrosine binding (v-SrcSH2D) had little effect on the interaction between Cas and Src (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, catalytically inactive v-Src (K295R) is still capable of interacting with Cas (data not shown), confirming that the primary interaction between the two proteins is not SH2 domain- or phosphotyrosine-dependent. Cas contains a polyproline region conforming to the type II consensus SH3 domain-binding sequence, RXLPPLPRΦ (Φ = hydrophobic amino acid) (Fig. 1 A). It has been reported previously that mutation of the C-terminal polyproline leads to impaired phosphorylation of Cas in mammalian cells (18Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We mutated the C-terminal polyproline sequence of Cas from RPLPSPP to RSLGSPG. We assayed the interaction between this mutant, designated CasPPX, and Src. The amount of β-galactosidase activity measured in these double transformants was the same as the negative control (Fig.1 C). Therefore, disrupting the C-terminal polyproline of Cas can completely abolish binding between Cas and Src. The experiments described above test the importance of certain regions of Cas in binding to Src. We developed a second yeast two-hybrid assay to probe their involvement in the phosphorylation of Cas by Src. The substrate domain of Cas contains 15 potential phosphorylation sites with the consensus YXXP. Nine of these motifs conform to the optimal Crk SH2 domain-binding site (7Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar). Therefore, we fused CrkSH2 to the binding domain of GAL4 and used it as a “reporter” for the phosphorylation status of Cas. The results are summarized in Fig.2. Binding between Cas and CrkSH2 occurs only when Src is coexpressed in the system, confirming that the interaction between Cas and CrkSH2 is phosphotyrosine-dependent (Fig. 2). This assay showed no difference in phosphorylation between CasWT and CasY668F. In contrast, CasPPX exhibits reduced phosphorylation of the substrate domain when compared with both CasWT and CasY668F (Fig. 2). However, interacti"

Magnetic beads coated with either anti-galectin-4 or anti-lactase antibodies were used for immunoisolation of vesicles followed by double immunogold labeling of the two proteins. A morphometric analysis revealed subpopulations of raft-rich and raft-poor vesicles by the following criteria: 1) the lactase/galectin-4 labeling ratio/vesicle captured by the anti-lactase beads was significantly higher (p ≤ 0.01) than that of vesicles captured by anti-galectin-4 beads, 2) subpopulations of vesicles labeled by only one of the two antibodies were preferentially captured by beads coated with the respective antibody (p ≤ 0.01), 3) the average diameter of “galectin-4 positive only” vesicles was smaller than that of vesicles labeled for lactase. Surprisingly, pretreatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which removed >70% of microvillar cholesterol, did not affect the microdomain localization of galectin-4.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), the biological relevance of glycosphingolipid/cholesterol-rich “raft” microdomains has been debated. The potential to serve as lateral platforms for selective subsets of peripheral and integral membrane proteins made rafts attractive candidates as actors in membrane trafficking, particularly in polarized cells, and in signaling events at the cell surface (recent reviews: Refs. 2Simons K.

Biochemically, lipid rafts are characterized by their resistance to detergent extraction at low temperature combined with the ability to float during density gradient centrifugation (10Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar), and studies on model membranes have indicated that cholesterol and sphingolipids are capable of forming ordered (lo phase) subdomains that resemble rafts (11Ahmed S.N.

However, raft microdomains have been difficult to visualize directly by microscopy in cell membranes without prior clustering of protein components, for instance by use of antibodies, toxins, or chemical cross-linkers (14Mayor S.

The problem concerning the size, if not the existence, of rafts has been tackled in several investigations during the past few years. Unfortunately, the use of fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique has given contradicting answers. Thus, by comparing the GPI1-anchored folate receptor with a transmembrane isoform, Varma and Mayor (20Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar) proposed the former to reside in raft domains with a size of up to 70 nm in diameter. However, studying the folate receptor as well as other GPI-anchored proteins (5′-nucleotidase and CD59) and a glycosphingolipid by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, it has also been argued that rafts are either only transient structures or, if stable, comprise only a minor fraction of the cell surface (21Hannan L.A. Lisanti M.P. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J.

Recently, a novel technique measuring the viscosity of the lipid environment around single particles was used to calculate a size of rafts that remained stable for several minutes to about 26 nm in radius (24Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.-L. Simons K. Hörber J.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Studying raft localization of aminopeptidase N/CD13 in fibroblast-like synoviocytes by immunogold labeling of fixed cells, we observed the protein in 60–160 nm flat patches at the cell surface as well as in caveolae (25Riemann D. Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.-L. Thorsen E. Immerdal L. Santos A.N. Kehlen A. Langner J. Danielsen E.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, more studies are clearly needed to visualize raft microdomains in membranes before their functional significance can be fully assessed. The small intestinal brush border is a highly organized membrane system with a high content of glycosphingolipid and cholesterol (26Christiansen K. Carlsen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Accordingly, many of its major digestive enzymes partially resist extraction at low temperature with Triton X-100 (27Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Upon tissue homogenization brush borders spontaneously form uniform, right side out spherical microvillar vesicles that can be easily isolated from other cell membranes by the divalent cation precipitation method (28Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 29Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 21: 449-463PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we made use of this property to study whether raft microdomains about the size previously suggested by others (20Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 24Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.-L. Simons K. Hörber J.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) exist in the brush border membrane, or alternatively, whether stable rafts are non-existent or too small to act as lateral sorting platforms (23Kenworthy A.K. Petranova N. Edidin M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). We took advantage of previous observations that lactase is virtually absent from the biochemically defined raft fraction (27Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), whereas galectin-4 essentially is confined to this fraction (30Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A morphometric analysis by immunogold double labeling of microvillar vesicles, isolated onto magnetic beads coated with antibodies to either of these two marker proteins, revealed the existence of subpopulations of relatively “raft-rich” and “raft-poor” microvillar vesicles, strongly arguing that stable raft microdomains do exist at the microvillar surface of small intestinal brush borders. Surprisingly, these microvillar rafts do not depend on the presence of cholesterol. DynabeadsTM M-500 Subcellular were purchased from Dynal (Oslo, Norway). The rabbit antibodies to pig small intestinal lactase and galectin-4 used in this work were described previously (30Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol.

A rabbit antibody to caveolin 1 was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled swine anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was obtained from Sigma. Pig small intestines were kindly given by the Dept. of Experimental Medicine, the Panum Institute. After a rinse of the small intestinal segments in ice-cold Hanks' buffered salt solution, mucosal explants were excised and cultured in Trowell's T-8 medium for 2 h in the presence or absence of 2% (w/v) methyl-β-cyclodextrin as described previously (32Danielsen E.M.

Antibodies were coupled to magnetic beads using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, the beads were first coated with a linker antibody (swine anti-rabbit IgG), using about 0.1 mg of antibody to 8 × 107 beads in a volume of 0.5 ml of 0.05m Na2B4O7, pH 9.5. After washing the beads four times, they were mixed with either anti-galectin-4 or anti-lactase using about 0.5 mg of antibody to 2 × 107 beads in a volume of 0.15 ml of 0.01m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. After washing the beads four times, they were resuspended in the above buffer containing 0.02% NaN3and kept at 4 °C until use. Right side out microvillar vesicles were prepared from control and cholesterol-depleted mucosal explants by the divalent cation precipitation method (28Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). For subsequent immunoisolation on magnetic beads, 0.3 ml of a microvillar suspension (about 1 mg of protein/ml) in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, was cleared by centrifugation at 10.000 × g for 5 min and mixed with 0.7 ml of antibody-coated magnetic beads (about 2 × 107 beads) in the same buffer. After incubation overnight at 4 °C with continuous mixing, the magnetic beads were washed four times in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. A lipid raft analysis of native and methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated microvillar vesicles was performed by Triton X-100 extraction (1%) on ice followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation according to Brown and Rose (10Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar) as previously described (27Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with the modification that the extracts were placed in a 60% sucrose cushion with a 50–25% sucrose gradient layered on top. Microvillar membrane vesicles from native and cholesterol-depleted mucosal explants captured onto antibody-coated magnetic beads were washed three times in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.2 and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde in PB for 1 h at 4 °C. The vesicles were then washed in PB (3 × 10 min), PBS (3 × 5 min), 37 °C PBS (1 × 5 min) and finally treated with 7.5% gelatin in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C and overnight for 4 °C. The pellet of magnetic beads now embedded in gelatin was transferred to PB and then treated with 1% osmium tetroxide in PB for 15 min at 4 °C. The magnetic beads were further treated with 1% uranyl acetate in water for 1 h at room temperature and then dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Epon as previously described (34Danielsen E.M. Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.-L. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1039-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections were cut using an LKB ultrotome 8800 III, collected on nickel grids and stained in lead citrate. The sections were examined in a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Preembedding immunogold double labeling of native and cholesterol-depleted microvillar vesicle preparations and vesicles, immunoisolated on magnetic beads from these preparations, was performed as follows: vesicles were washed three times in PB before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde in PB for 1 h at 4 °C. After a rinse in PB (3 × 10 min) the magnetic beads were treated with 3% BSA for 30 min and incubated in rabbit anti-pig galectin-4 overnight at 4 °C and for 1 h at room temperature. After a rinse in TBS containing 0.25% BSA (3 × 10 min), the vesicles/magnetic beads were next incubated in sheep anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 7 nm gold particles (35Hansen G.H. Wetterberg L.-L. Sjöström H. Norén O. Histochem. J. 1992; 24: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) for 1 h. The vesicles/magnetic beads were then washed in TBS (3 × 10 min) and PB (2 × 5 min) before fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde in PB for 1 h (this treatment destroys the antigenicity in the antibody complex). After a rinse in PB (3 × 5 min) and TBS (2 × 5 min) the vesicles/magnetic beads were treated with 3% BSA in TBS (30 min) at 4 °C before incubation in rabbit anti-pig lactase for 1 h. After a wash in TBS containing 0.25% BSA (3 × 10 min), the vesicles/magnetic beads were incubated in sheep anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 13 nm of large gold particles for 1 h. The vesicles/magnetic beads were washed in TBS (3 × 10 min) and PB (2 × 5 min) before being fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PB for 5 min at 4 °C. The vesicles/magnetic beads were then washed in PB (2 × 5 min), PBS (three times), and PBS at 37 °C (5 min) and finally treated with 7.5% gelatin in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C and overnight at 4 °C. The pellet of vesicles/magnetic beads now embedded in gelatin was processed for ultrastructural analysis as described above. For ultracryosectioning of pig intestinal enterocytes, small pieces of pig small intestinal mucosa were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PB for 2 h at 4 °C. After a rinse in PB (3 × 10 min) the tissue pieces were infused with 2.3 m sucrose in PB for 30 min, then mounted on top of a metal pin, and subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultracryosectioning and immunogold double labeling were performed as described previously (36Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.-L. Immerdal L. Hunziker W. Kenny A.J. Danielsen E.M. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 610-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The morphometric analysis was performed on a monitor using a MTI CCP 72 video camera system. The labeling density of lactase and galectin-4 on immunoisolated native and cholesterol-depleted microvillar vesicles was determined by counting the number of gold particles on 250 randomly chosen labeled vesicles from each immunoisolation (a total of 1000 vesicles). In another analysis, 250 randomly chosen labeled immunoisolated vesicles from each immunoisolation (a total of 1000 vesicles) were examined and grouped into three categories according to their labeling as follows: 1) ‘lactase- and galectin-4-positive’ (those vesicles labeled by at least one gold particle for each of the two markers), 2) ‘galectin-4-positive only’, and 3) ‘lactase-positive only’. The mean diameter of the vesicles in the above categories was determined by measuring the diameter of 50 randomly chosen vesicles from each category. Statistic analysis of the data was performed using the χ2-test. SDS/PAGE in 15% polyacrylamide gels was performed according to Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis and transfer onto ImmobilonTM, Western blotting was performed with rabbit antibodies to lactase (31Skovbjerg H. Norén O. Sjöström H. Danielsen E.M. Enevoldsen B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 707: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), galectin-4 (30Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and caveolin-1. Blots were developed by electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cholesterol concentration in native and cholesterol-depleted microvillar vesicle preparations and sucrose gradient fractions was determined spectrophotometrically by a cholesterol oxidase/peroxidase assay (38Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avignan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Chloroform/methanol extraction of total lipid in native and methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated microvillar vesicle membranes was carried out as described previously (26Christiansen K. Carlsen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 40Suzuki K. J. Neurochem. 1965; 12: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the lipid extracts (120–130 µg of lipid) were subjected to thin layer chromatography analysis together with lipid standards on 0.25 mm silica gel 60 plates (Merck). Cholesterol was separated from other neutral lipids in petroleumsether/diethylether/acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v). Glycolipids and phospholipids were separated in chloroform/methanol/water (64:24:4, v/v). After separation, cholesterol was detected with a CuSO4/H3PO4 reagent and glycolipids were detected with a α-naphtol spray reagent. From a theoretical viewpoint, rafts should be of sufficient size to accommodate several proteins at a time if they are likely to be of functional significance in complex protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions taking place during sorting and signal transduction events (4Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar, 18Hooper N.M. Curr.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 87-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In the present work, we tried to address the problem whether lipid rafts are able to exist in a cell membrane as stable domains of a size large enough to be detectable as clusters of marker proteins by immunogold electron microscopy. As a model membrane, we chose to study the enterocyte brush border membrane, which is known to contain high amounts of cholesterol and glycolipids (26Christiansen K. Carlsen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and is a rich source of lipid rafts defined by biochemical criteria (27Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition, because endocytosis/exocytosis does not take place along the microvillar surface but at the ‘microcrypts’ between adjacent microvilli, clustering of proteins by forces acting in coated pit formation (41Gheber L.A. Edidin M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3163-3175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) would not be likely to obscure the study. Galectin-4, a member of the galectin family of β-galactoside-binding proteins (42Harrison F.L. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 9-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 44Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was almost exclusively present in the Triton X-100-resistant fraction of microvillar vesicles and is thus a suitable marker for raft membrane microdomains (30, Fig.1). Members of the galectin family of β-galactoside-binding proteins generally lack a signal peptide for cotranslational membrane translocation but are instead secreted by a poorly understood ‘nonclassical’ mechanism (45Hughes R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, we have previously localized a substantial fraction of the protein on the ectoplasmic side of microvilli (30Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast to galectin-4, lactase almost exclusively resided in the “non-raft” fraction (Fig. 1) as previously reported (27Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and it is therefore a suitable marker protein for non-raft membrane domains in the microvillar membrane. Surprisingly, the major part of microvillar caveolin 1, a commonly used raft marker in other cell types (5Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar), was solubilized by Triton X-100 (Fig. 1). We have no explanation for this unusual observation but speculate that it may be related to the fact that morphologically recognizable caveolae are not normally present in the intestinal brush border membrane (46Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 939-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 47Verkade P. Harder T. Lafont F. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 148: 727-739Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fig. 2shows the distribution of galectin-4 and lactase over the intestinal microvillar brush border membrane by double immunogold labeling. Both proteins were seen along the entire length of the microvilli, but although galectin-4 labeling frequently appeared in clusters, it is not possible from this type of data alone to decide whether or not the two markers are truly restricted to separate microdomains. We therefore chose to study the two raft and non-raft markers by an analysis of their distribution on microvillar vesicles prepared from small intestinal mucosa by the divalent cation precipitation method (28Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, such a preparation predominantly consisted of dark-filled spherical vesicles of about 100 nm in diameter, characteristic of right side out-vesiculated microvilli with elements of the actin cytoskeleton entrapped inside (29Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 21: 449-463PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling for both galectin-4 and lactase was seen widespread over the microvillar vesicle population with many vesicles being positive for only one of the two markers, suggesting that raft and non-raft domains are distributed over most of the brush border membrane. The labeling for galectin-4 frequently appeared in clusters, as was also seen with intact microvilli. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin is an agent commonly used for disruption of rafts by specifically depleting membranes of cholesterol, and we have previously used this agent to reduce the cholesterol content of mucosal explants by >50%, a treatment that perturbs the Golgi complex morphology and apical membrane trafficking (33Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.-L. Thorsen E. Immerdal L. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5136-5142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the labeling pattern observed for methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated microvillar vesicles appeared similar to that of control vesicles (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Double immunogold labeling of microvillar vesicles for galectin-4 and lactase. Native and methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated microvillar vesicles were prepared and double immunogold labeled for lactase (13 nm particles) and galectin-4 (7 nm particles) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, native vesicles; B,methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated vesicles. Notice that both markers are widespread over the vesicle population and that galectin-4 is often seen in clusters in both A and B. C,control experiment, showing a labeling of native vesicles with omission of anti-lactase antibodies. Labeling with large particles is essentially absent. Bars, 0.1 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Despite the frequently observed clustering of galectin-4, the fact that a significant proportion of vesicles were positive for both markers is suggestive that raft microdomains, if they exist, are likely to be smaller than a 100-nm spherical vesicle. As indicated by Fig. 1, the biochemically defined raft fraction contained somewhat less than half the total amount of protein of intestinal microvilli. Given a total surface area of about 31,000 nm2 for a 100-nm spherical microvillar vesicle and assuming a similar density in the membrane of raft and non-raft proteins, respectively, this implies that ≤15,000–16,000 nm2/vesicle on average is occupied by raft microdomains. If a circular raft patch as reported (24Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.-L. Simons K. Hörber J.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) has a radius of 26 nm and thus occupies ∼2100 nm2, it follows that a microvillar vesicle on average should harbor ≤7–8 separate rafts. In a large population, however, such an average number would probably reflect a broad distribution of raft-rich and raft-poor vesicles as illustrated by Fig.4A. If, on the other hand, raft microdomains are very much smaller than assumed in the above calculation, then all microvillar vesicles in a large population should have roughly similar contents of raft and non-raft markers as illustrated in Fig. 4 B. To test experimentally the two rivaling raft models depicted in Fig. 4, we isolated microvillar vesicles on antibody-coated magnetic beads and analyzed them by double immunogold labeling. If vesicles thus immunoisolated showed the same relative distribution of galectin-4 and lactase on their surface regardless of which antibody was used for their capture, then raft membrane domains most likely must be of a very small size as indicated in Fig. 4 B. If, on the other hand, microvillar vesicles captured by anti-galectin-4 beads and anti-lactase beads differed in their relative contents of galectin-4 and lactase, raft membrane microdomains of a larger size (Fig. 4 A) should indeed exist. As shown in Fig. 5, spherical microvillar vesicles adhered both to beads coated with anti-galectin-4 and anti-lactase but not to control beads containing only linker antibody, indicating a specific immunoadsorption of vesicles to both the anti-galectin-4 and anti-lactase beads. Fig.6shows a panel of immunoisolated vesicles at higher magnification after a subsequent double immunogold labeling for lactase (large gold particles) and galectin-4 (small gold particles). Some vesicles captured by anti-lactase or anti-galectin-4 beads were labeled by both antibodies, but vesicles labeled for only one of the two markers were frequently observed. This labeling heterogeneity resembles the pattern seen in Fig. 3 and shows that both types of immunobeads captured vesicles representative of the whole population of microvillar vesicles. The heterogeneity with respect to labeling could potentially reflect the existence of genuine subpopulations of raft-rich and raft-poor microvillar vesicles, but it might also simply be caused by an inconsistent labeling of the vesicles. However, we have previously shown that immunogold labeling of microvillar vesicles is a quantitative method (35Hansen G.H. Wetterberg L.-L. Sjöström H. Norén O. Histochem. J. 1992; 24: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), so a true vesicle heterogeneity should be revealed by a closer comparison of anti-galectin-4- and anti-lactase-captured vesicles as the two types of antibody-beads have complementary affinities for such vesicle subpopulations. Therefore, a morphometric analysis was performed to characterize immunoisolated vesicles with regard to labeling density and size (diameter), and the data obtained are summarized in TableI. First, the average lactase/galectin-4 labeling ratio (ratio of number of large and small gold particles) was significantly higher (p ≤ 0.01) on vesicles captured by the anti-lactase beads, implying that the population of microvillar vesicles is indeed heterogeneous with respect to the two markers. To explore this difference further, the immunoisolated and double immunogold labeled vesicles were next grouped according to their labeling as either being: 1) “lactase- and galectin-4-positive” (being labeled by at least one gold particle of each type), 2) “galectin-4-positive only”, or 3) “lactase-positive only”. For both types of beads, a minor fraction of captured vesicles were both lactase- and galectin-4-positive. However, anti-galectin-4 and anti-lactase beads captured the latter two vesicle subpopulations in significantly different relative proportions (p ≤ 0.01), with vesicles positive for only one of the two markers being captured most frequently by beads coated with antibodies to the respective marker. Finally, a measurement of diameters of the three categories of vesicles indicated that galectin-4-positive only vesicles on average are somewhat smaller than those labeled by anti-lactase gold particles, irrespective of the type of beads used for the vesicle capture. The latter observation may reflect differences in the physical properties of raft-rich and raft-poor membrane microdomains (11Ahmed S.N. Brown D.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar).Figure 6Double immunogold labeling of immunoisolated microvillar vesicles. Panels of native (A and B) and methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated (C and D) microvillar vesicles captured by anti-galectin-4 (A andC) or anti-lactase (B and D) beads. After capture, the vesicles were double immunogold labeled for lactase (large gold particles, 13 nm) and galectin-4 (small gold particles, 7 nm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown, both types of beads captured vesicles being either lactase- and galectin-4-positive, galectin-4-positive only, and lactase-positive only. Because the antibody coating of the beads was also labeled, only gold particles attached to the vesicle membrane free of the surface of the underlying bead were included in the morphometric analysis presented in Table I.

Open table in a new tab Microvillar vesicles isolated from either native or methyl-β-cyclodextrin-treated mucosal explants were immunoisolated and double immunogold labeled for lactase and galectin-4 as shown in Fig. 6. Subsequent morphometric analysis of the labeling density and diameter of the vesicles was performed as described in “Experimental Procedures.” In all countings of vesicle-associated gold particles, those particles localized between the vesicle and the underlying bead were excluded. As shown in Table I, the above morphometric analysis was also performed on microvillar vesicles prepared from mucosal explants treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Surprisingly, the morphological analysis of cholesterol-depleted vesicles did not indicate a disruption of microdomains by the treatment. Thus, the difference in lactase/galectin-4 labeling ratio of vesicles captured by the two types of beads was increased rather than decreased relative to native vesicles, and the percentage of lactase- and galectin-4-positive vesicles was only marginally increased (Table I). In agreement with this, a raft analysis by sucrose gradient centrifugation showed that galectin-4 largely remained in the floating part of the gradient also after a treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which extracted >70% of the microvillar cholesterol in the experiment shown (Fig.7). This “cyclodextrin resistance” of microvillar rafts was studied further by an analysis of the lipid composition of native and cholesterol-depleted microvillar vesicles and rafts. As shown in Fig. 8, methyl-β-cyclodextrin removed the major part of the microvillar cholesterol without affecting the membrane contents of phospholipids and glycosphingolipids. Rafts prepared from native and cholesterol-depleted microvillar vesicles had comparable amounts of glycosphingolipids (and phospholipids) regardless of their differing contents of cholesterol, demonstrating that cholesterol is not essential for maintaining the raft microdomain stability.Figure 8Lipid analysis of microvillar vesicles and rafts.

Because the microvillar vesicles were prepared by a detergent-free protocol this implies that rafts most likely are also able to exist as stable microdomains in the brush border membrane. Surprisingly, cholesterol-depletion had little, if any effect on the stability of microvillar rafts. Instead they seem to rely on the presence of glycosphingolipids. The lipid composition of pig intestinal microvillar vesicles has previously been determined (26Christiansen K. Carlsen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), showing that cholesterol comprises 12% and glycosphingolipids about 30% of the total lipid. Di- and pentahexosylceramides containing fucose, galactose, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine were identified as the major glycosphingolipids. Although the latter have long been acknowledged as raft components, cholesterol has generally been considered the major lipid molecule for maintaining raft stability, probably because its removal effectively disrupts caveolae and renders caveolin 1 detergent-soluble in various types of cells. However, cholesterol is not indispensable for raft stability. Thus, in a study on model liposomal membranes, a high concentration (33 mol %) of sphingolipid was shown to allow ordered phase formation in the absence of cholesterol (12Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In vivo, stable, cholesterol-independent rafts may well be a specialty of apical membranes of epithelial cells that seem to lack caveolae. In the enterocyte, as in other epithelial cells, raft domains form during intracellular transport and are likely to play a key role in the apical sorting of newly synthesized brush border proteins as well as in transcytotic membrane trafficking of IgA (27Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 36Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.-L. Immerdal L. Hunziker W. Kenny A.J. Danielsen E.M. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 610-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment affects both the Golgi complex morphology and apical membrane trafficking, indicating the importance of cholesterol for normal functioning of the exocytic pathway in this cell type (33Hansen G.H.

However, after exocytosis at the brush border membrane, clustering in stable, cholesterol-independent microdomains may be a mechanism to increase local concentrations (creating catalytic ‘hot spots‘) of certain proteins, maybe to facilitate a more efficient assimilation of nutrients. Interestingly, prominin, a microvillar protein when expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, was recently shown to reside in rafts segregated from other raft microdomains harboring alkaline phosphatase, implying that the raft concept may cover a more heterogeneous variety of subdomains than previously acknowledged (48Röper K. Corbell D. Huttner W.B. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). We thank Prof. Jørgen Hilden for assistance with the statistical analysis and Profs.

https://openalex.org/W2123820629,"For some time now, there has been considerable experimental and theoretical effort to understand the role of the normal-state ""pseudogap"" phase in underdoped high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Recent debate has centered on the question of whether the pseudogap is independent of superconductivity. We provide evidence from zero-field muon spin relaxation measurements in YBa2Cu3O6+x for the presence of small spontaneous static magnetic fields of electronic origin intimately related to the pseudogap transition. Our most significant finding is that, for optimal doping, these weak static magnetic fields appear well below the superconducting transition temperature. The two compositions measured suggest the existence of a quantum critical point somewhat above optimal doping."

Mice with a single functional Atp2a2allele (the mouse homolog of ATP2A2) were shown previously to have reduced levels of SERCA2 in heart and mildly impaired cardiac contractility and relaxation. Here we show that aged heterozygous mutant (Atp2a2 +/−) mice develop squamous cell tumors of the forestomach, esophagus, oral mucosa, tongue, and skin. Squamous cell tumors occurred in 13/14Atp2a2 +/− mice but were not observed in age- and sex-matched wild-type controls. Hyperkeratinized squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas of the upper digestive tract were the most frequent finding among Atp2a2 +/− mice, and many animals had multiple tumors. Western blot analyses showed that SERCA2 protein levels were reduced in skin and other affected tissues of heterozygous mice. The development of squamous cell tumors in agedAtp2a2 +/− mice indicates that SERCA2 haploinsufficiency predisposes murine keratinocytes to neoplasia. These findings provide the first direct demonstration that a perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis or signaling can serve as a primary initiating event in cancer. Mutations in the human ATP2A2gene, encoding sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2 (SERCA2), cause Darier disease, an autosomal dominant skin disease characterized by multiple keratotic papules in the seborrheic regions of the body. Mice with a single functional Atp2a2allele (the mouse homolog of ATP2A2) were shown previously to have reduced levels of SERCA2 in heart and mildly impaired cardiac contractility and relaxation. Here we show that aged heterozygous mutant (Atp2a2 +/−) mice develop squamous cell tumors of the forestomach, esophagus, oral mucosa, tongue, and skin. Squamous cell tumors occurred in 13/14Atp2a2 +/− mice but were not observed in age- and sex-matched wild-type controls. Hyperkeratinized squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas of the upper digestive tract were the most frequent finding among Atp2a2 +/− mice, and many animals had multiple tumors. Western blot analyses showed that SERCA2 protein levels were reduced in skin and other affected tissues of heterozygous mice.

SERCA2 (gene locus symbol, Atp2a2for mouse and ATP2A2 for human), the most widely expressed SERCA isoform, has two C-terminal variants (1Gunteski-Hamblin A.-M. Greeb J. Shull G.E. J. Biol.

SERCA2a is expressed primarily in heart, where it mediates cardiac muscle relaxation and maintains sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores on a beat to beat basis; SERCA2b is expressed in all tissues and is thought to be the major endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump (3Shull G.E.

We changed our objective when we observed two deaths of unknown causes (autolysis precluded detailed analysis of tissues, although one mouse had a prolapsed penis) among mutant mice of an aging cohort of 16 experimental pairs. The remaining mice were monitored over time, and 12 of the 14 Atp2a2 +/− mice were examined when disease symptoms were clearly apparent, at ages ranging from 53–81 weeks. The two mutants that did not exhibit overt disease symptoms during the course of the study were euthanized and examined at 89 weeks of age. The wild-type controls, most of which showed no evidence of disease symptoms, were euthanized ∼4–5 weeks after the lastAtp2a2 +/− mice; their ages ranged from 81 to 94 weeks.As shown in Fig. 1, the viability ofAtp2a2 +/− mice was markedly decreased compared with that of wild-type mice. Indications of disease among theAtp2a2 +/− mice included growths on the face, abdominal masses, prolapsed penis, lethargy, and loss of weight. The benign skin lesions characteristic of Darier disease in humans were not apparent in Atp2a2 +/− mice but, as described below, the affected cell type, keratinocytes, was the same. Although mild fibrosis was observed in some of the hearts from diseasedAtp2a2 +/− mice, there were no major cardiac lesions or hypertrophy when compared with wild-type controls. As summarized in TableI, the major histopathological correlates of morbidity in Atp2a2 +/− mice were hyperkeratinized squamous cell tumors of the stomach, esophagus, tongue, oral mucosa, and skin (13/14 mice; 93%), with an average of more than two tumors per mouse. Two Atp2a2 +/−mice exhibited extreme hyperkeratosis of a toenail, and another heterozygote had a large cystic mass containing keratin and bordered by squamous epithelium.Table IDistribution of squamous cell tumors and hyperplasia in aged Atp2a2+/− miceSexAgeEsophagusStomachTongue/oral mucosaSkin/nailsweeksM89HyperplasiaM81PapillomaCarcinomaTongue carcinomaInguinal area-keratinized cystPenis hyperplasiaF89PapillomaCarcinomaTongue papillomaToenail hyperkeratosisM74PapillomaPapillomaNEaFacial growth carcinomaM68CarcinomaNEF65NEFacial growth carcinomaM75HyperplasiaPapillomas/hyperplasiaTongue carcinomaPenis papillomaM76HyperplasiaCarcinoma/papilloma/hyperplasiaOral mucosa carcinomaPenis carcinomaM66PapillomaHyperplasiaTongue papillomaPenis carcinomaF64PapillomaHyperplasiaNEF77Tongue papillomaM58PapillomaCarcinomaTongue carcinomaToenail hyperkeratosis, dyskeratosis, parakeratosisM53PapillomaCarcinomaOral mucosa carcinomaM77HyperplasiaTongue carcinomaNE, not examined. Open table in a new tab Among the 16 wild-type controls, two males died of unknown causes (at 58 and 86 weeks), a 94-week-old male had a hepatocellular adenoma, a 91-week-old male had an adenocarcinoma of the lung and hyperplasia of the forestomach, and an 82-week-old female had a mammary carcinoma, a leiomyosarcoma of one uterine horn, a lymphoma, and an alveolar adenoma. Squamous cell tumors or evidence of hyperkeratosis or dyskeratosis of the tissues that were affected in heterozygous mutants were not observed in the wild-type mice.Squamous cell tumors of the forestomach (non-glandular mucosa) and esophagus occurred in 10/14 (71%) Atp2a2 +/−mice. Six animals had hyperkeratinized squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach (Fig. 2, A–C). Although less common than carcinomas, squamous cell papillomas were also observed in forestomachs of Atp2a2 +/− mice (Fig. 2 D). Papillomas of the esophagus occurred in 7/14 mutant mice (Fig. 2 E). Even in the absence of overt tumors of the stomach and esophagus, hyperplastic changes in the epithelial lining of the forestomach and esophagus were frequently observed (TableI). Squamous cell tumors were observed in the tongue or oral mucosa of 9/10 of the Atp2a2 +/− mice in which the mouth was examined. Four mice had carcinomas of the tongue (Fig. 2,F and G), three had papillomas of the tongue (Fig. 2 H), and two had carcinomas of the oral mucosa (cheek) (Fig. 2 I). Squamous cell tumors of the skin were seen in 5/14 mice and included two with carcinomas of the face (Fig. 2,J and K), two with carcinomas of the penis (Fig.2 L), and one with a papilloma of the penis. We have observed additional squamous cell tumors in retiredAtp2a2 +/− breeders but not in their wild-type mates; tumors in locations that were not seen in the 14 mutants described in Table I included carcinomas of the esophagus, lip, palette, and the skin adjacent to the vagina, penis, and anus.Figure 2Squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas of keratinized epithelial tissues inAtp2a2 +/− mice.

These data demonstrate that the loss of one Atp2a2 allele causes a reduction in SERCA2 protein levels in these tissues, as observed previously in heart (4Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H. Ji Y.

Most of these tumors are rare in normal mice; among 4900 mice analyzed in the National Toxicology Program, there were only 11 cases of squamous cell tumors of the skin, 4 cases of squamous cell tumors of the oral cavity (any site), and only one squamous cell tumor of the esophagus (11Haseman J.K. Elwell M.R. Hailey J.R. Maronpot R.R. Boorman G.A. Gaul B.W. Pathology of the Mouse, Reference and Atlas. Cach River Press, Vienna, IL1999: 679-689Google Scholar). In the current study, we observed 30 squamous cell tumors among 14Atp2a2 +/− mice and none in the wild-type controls. The high predisposition of Atp2a2 +/−mice to the development of squamous cell tumors provides compelling evidence that a perturbation of intracellular Ca2+homeostasis and/or signaling can lead to cancer.Squamous cell carcinomas and papillomas are not a common feature of Darier disease, although a number of case histories have been reported (12Downs A.M.R. Ward K.A. Peachey R.D.G. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 22: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Orihuela E. Tyring S.K. Pow-Sang M. Dozier S. Cirelli R. Arany I. Rady P. Sanchez R. J.

Dermatol. 2000; 10: 470-472PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with the possibility that SERCA2 haploinsufficiency may cause a low incidence of skin cancer in humans. Similarly, although we did not observe skin lesions in the mouse model that resembled the keratotic papules seen in Darier disease, we did observe hyperkeratotic nail abnormalities and a keratinized cyst (TableI), both of which are reminiscent of findings in Darier patients (6Burge S.M. Wilkinson J.D. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1992; 27: 40-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar,15Mittag H. J. Cutan. Pathol. 1900; 17: 388-390Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to gain a clearer understanding of the similarities and dissimilarities in disease phenotypes between the two species. In both mouse and human, lesions resulting from SERCA2 haploinsufficiency arise in keratinized squamous epithelial cells, suggesting that there are similarities in the initial stages of disease in the two species. Although there are species differences in the location of the affected tissues, this is likely to be because of differences in the distribution of keratinized squamous epithelial cells. In mice, this includes the skin, oral mucosa, tongue, esophagus, and forestomach (16Schweizer J. Rentrop M. Nischt R. Kinjo M. Winter H. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 253: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas in humans, it includes the skin and oral palette, where Darier lesions have been observed (6Burge S.M. Wilkinson J.D. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1992; 27: 40-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In both humans and mice, keratinocytes have been shown to be highly sensitive to perturbations of calcium homeostasis (8Lowry D.T. Li L. Henning H. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Jones K.T. Sharpe G.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Li L. Tucker R.W.

Physiol. 1991; 261: C767-C773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to exhibit changes in differentiation and proliferation in response to treatment with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of SERCA Ca2+ pumps (8Lowry D.T. Li L. Henning H. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the Atp2a2 +/− mouse should serve as a suitable model for studying the perturbations in Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling in keratinocytes that occur as an immediate consequence of the mutation and the subsequent changes, including additional genetic mutations, that lead to cancer.Important issues to be addressed in future studies are the genetic and cell biological mechanisms of tumorogenesis. It is conceivable that the tumors arise from cells that have lost the remaining wild-type allele; however, given the critical function of SERCA2 in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores and the severe effect of SERCA2 haploinsufficiency in keratinocytes of Darier disease patients, it seems more likely that the perturbation of Ca2+homeostasis causes an increased susceptibility to the accumulation of genetic changes at other loci. Some of the immediate consequences of a reduction in SERCA2 activity with respect to intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling are reasonably well understood (20Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Partial inhibition of SERCA2 by exposure to thapsigargin, a tumor promoter in murine two-stage skin carcinogenesis (21Hakii H. Fujiki H. Suganuma M. Nakayasu M. Tahira T. Sugimura T. Scheuer P.J. Christensen S.B. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1986; 111: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), increases the frequency of intracellular Ca2+ spikes in some cells (22Petersen C.C.H. Petersen O.H. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22262-22264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that an impaired ability to buffer elevations in cytoplasmic Ca2+ by removing it from the cytosol may decrease the interspike interval by stimulating Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (22Petersen C.C.H. Petersen O.H. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22262-22264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of Ca2+ stores by Ca2+ release during signaling events or by treatment with thapsigargin has been shown to cause increased Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (23Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rodland K.D. Wersto R.P. Hobson S. Kohn E.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a Ca2+influx inhibitor, carboxyamido-triazole, which would appear to have the potential to correct some of the imbalances in Ca2+homeostasis resulting from mutations in the Atp2a2 gene (or its human homolog in Darier disease), has been shown to be effective in the treatment of some cancers (9Wu Y. Palad A.J. Wasilenko W.J. Blackmore P.F. Pincus W.A. Schechter G.L. Spoonster J.R. Kohn E.C. Somers K.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1915-1921PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cole K. Kohn E.

It is conceivable that it could be used in a topical treatment for Darier disease. Ultimately, the increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels and excitability of Ca2+ signaling mechanisms occurring as a direct result of SERCA2 haploinsufficiency may cause perturbations in gene expression (24Rodland K.D.

Open table in a new tab Among the 16 wild-type controls, two males died of unknown causes (at 58 and 86 weeks), a 94-week-old male had a hepatocellular adenoma, a 91-week-old male had an adenocarcinoma of the lung and hyperplasia of the forestomach, and an 82-week-old female had a mammary carcinoma, a leiomyosarcoma of one uterine horn, a lymphoma, and an alveolar adenoma. Squamous cell tumors or evidence of hyperkeratosis or dyskeratosis of the tissues that were affected in heterozygous mutants were not observed in the wild-type mice.Squamous cell tumors of the forestomach (non-glandular mucosa) and esophagus occurred in 10/14 (71%) Atp2a2 +/−mice. Six animals had hyperkeratinized squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach (Fig. 2, A–C). Although less common than carcinomas, squamous cell papillomas were also observed in forestomachs of Atp2a2 +/− mice (Fig. 2 D). Papillomas of the esophagus occurred in 7/14 mutant mice (Fig. 2 E). Even in the absence of overt tumors of the stomach and esophagus, hyperplastic changes in the epithelial lining of the forestomach and esophagus were frequently observed (TableI). Squamous cell tumors were observed in the tongue or oral mucosa of 9/10 of the Atp2a2 +/− mice in which the mouth was examined. Four mice had carcinomas of the tongue (Fig. 2,F and G), three had papillomas of the tongue (Fig. 2 H), and two ha"

In the familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)-Turku LDL receptor allele, a mutation of glycine 823 residue affects the signal required for basolateral targeting in MDCK cells. We show that the mutant receptor is mistargeted to the apical surface in both MDCK and hepatic epithelial cells, resulting in reduced endocytosis of LDL from the basolateral/sinusoidal surface. Consequently, virally encoded mutant receptor fails to mediate cholesterol clearance in LDL receptor-deficient mice, suggesting that a defect in polarized LDL receptor expression in hepatocytes underlies the hypercholesterolemia in patients harboring this allele. This evidence directly links the pathogenesis of a human disease to defects in basolateral targeting signals, providing a genetic confirmation of these signals in maintaining epithelial cell polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2020826295,"Satellite observations have shown the occasional occurrence of a large opening in the sea-ice cover of the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, a phenomenon known as the Weddell Polynya. The transient appearance, position, size, and shape of the polynya is explained here by a mechanism by which modest variations in the large-scale oceanic flow past the Maud Rise seamount cause a horizontal cyclonic eddy to be shed from its northeast flank. The shed eddy transmits a divergent Ekman stress into the sea ice, leading to a crescent-shaped opening in the pack. Atmospheric thermodynamical interaction further enhances the opening by inducing oceanic convection. A sea-ice-ocean computer model simulation vividly demonstrates how this mechanism fully accounts for the characteristics that mark Weddell Polynya events."

In this study, by using a tetravalent derivative of the preS1-(21–47) sequence, we have isolated by affinity chromatography from detergent-solubilized HepG2 plasma membranes a 44-kDa protein (HBV-binding protein; HBV-BP), which was found to closely correspond to the human squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1), a member of the ovalbumin family of serine protease inhibitors. Comparison of SCCA1 sequence with the sequence of the corresponding HBV-BP cDNA, cloned by polymerase chain reaction starting from RNA poly(A)+ fractions extracted from HepG2 cells, indicated the presence of only four nucleotide substitutions in the coding region, leading to three amino acid changes. Intact recombinant HBV-BP lacked inhibitory activity for serine proteases such as α-chymotrypsin and trypsin but inhibited with high potency cysteine proteases such as papain and cathepsin L. Direct binding experiments confirmed the interaction of recombinant HBV-BP with the HBV preS1 domain. HepG2 cells overexpressing HBV-BP after transfection of corresponding cDNA showed a virus binding capacity increased by 2 orders of magnitude compared with untransfected cells, while Chinese hamster ovary cells, which normally do not bind to HBV, acquired susceptibility to HBV binding after transfection. Native HBV particle entry was enhanced in transfected cells. Both recombinant HBV-BP and antibodies to recombinant HBV-BP blocked virus binding and internalization in transfected cells as well as in primary human hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that this protein plays a major role in HBV infection.

Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The mechanism of hepatocyte infection induced by this noncytolytic virus is not yet clear. The infectious unit of HBV is an enveloped virion of 42-nm diameter that contains an icosahedral nucleocapsid that encompasses a circular, partly double-stranded DNA molecule with a single strand region of variable length, a DNA-linked protein with functions critical for packaging and DNA replication, including priming, RNA- and DNA- dependent DNA polymerase, and RNAH activities. The HBV envelope that determines the targeting to the host cells and the early entry steps is composed of three proteins anchored in a lipid bilayer, occurring in mature virions in both glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms. The three proteins are called small (S), middle (M), and large (L) surface HBV antigens (HBsAg). They are the translational products of three overlapping open reading frames that start from different initiation codons localized at the 5′ end of the preS1, preS2, and S regions of the env gene (2Tiollais P. Pourcel C. Dejean A. Nature. 1985; 317: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). The role of the preS1 region of the L protein appears to be important in cell attachment and consequently in viral infectivity, since preS1 synthetic peptides and corresponding antibodies inhibit virus binding to HepG2 cells (3Neurath A.R. Kent S.B.H. Strick N. Parker K. Cell. 1986; 46: 429-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 4Qiao M. Macnaughton T.B. Gowans E.J. Virology. 1994; 201: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A cellular receptor is required for HBV binding and penetration in liver cells. Studies in rat hepatoma cells transfected with the HBV genome (5Shih C.H. Li L.S. Roychoudhrury S. Ho M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6323-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and transgenic mice with the genome integrated (6Guidotti L.G. Matzke B. Schaller H. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1995; 58: 945-950Google Scholar) indicate that HBV is able to replicate in rodent cells once it bypasses the attachment and entry steps of infection, so that the absence of specific cellular receptor(s) constitutes the barrier of HBV infection and replication in nonhuman hepatocytes. A number of putative human cellular receptors for HBV have been proposed, including the receptor for immunoglobulin A (IgA), which shows a partial sequence similarity between the Fc region of the IgA α chain and the preS1 domain of the virus (7Neurath A.R. Strick N. Virology. 1989; 178: 631-634Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Pontisso P. Ruvoletto M.G. Tiribelli C. Gerlich W.H. Ruol A. Alberti A. J. Gen.

Med. 1992; 176: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, HBV particles bind isolated asialoglycoprotein receptors through the HBV preS1 domain (11Treichel U. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Stockert R.J. Poralla T. Gerken G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 3021-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), whereas the preS2 domain seems involved in the interaction with the transferrin receptor (12Franco A. Parioli M. Testa U. Benvenuto R. Peschle C. Balsano F. Barnaba V. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is also known that the preS region of the duck HBV, another member of the hepadnaviruses family, binds to a 170-kilodalton cellular protein having significant similarities to human and animal carboxypeptidases H, M, and N (13Tong S. Li J. Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 696-8702Crossref Google Scholar). Other proteins have been identified that bind to different domains of the HBV envelope proteins with a proposed role as mediators in HBV attachment to the hepatocyte. Apolipoprotein H (14Mehdi H. Kaplan M.J. Anlar F.Y. Yang X. Bayer R. Sutherland K. Peeples M.E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2415-2424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) binds to the S domain, whereas polymerized human serum albumin (15Pontisso P. Petit M.A. Bankowski M.J. Peeples M.E. J.

Strick N. Virology. 1994; 204: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, an 80-kDa protein that binds to the preS1 domain of HBV has been isolated but not identified. In addition, this protein has been detected in rat hepatocytes, which are not susceptible to HBV infection (20Ryu C.J. Cho D-Y. Gripon P. Kim H.S. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Hong H.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results are conflicting, and no conclusive and convincing biological data have been obtained to fully demonstrate the functional role of these proteins in HBV binding and internalization. None of these proteins has been obtained in a recombinant form to show inhibition of HBV binding to and internalization on primary human hepatocytes. HBV receptor identification is hampered mainly by the virus-restricted host range and tissue tropism of the virus and the lack of a reproducible in vitro infection systems. Primary human hepatocytes are reported to be susceptible to HBV infection but are difficult to study because they are short lived and require primary explanted liver, and reproducibility of infection requires treatment of the cells with chemical agents that may induce unnatural mechanisms of viral entry (21Galle P.R. Hagelstein J. Kommerell B. Volkmann M. Schranz P. Zentgraf H. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 664-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, human hepatoma HepG2 cells, grown under conditions designed to maintain the hepatocyte-specific differentiated function, are thought to express the HBV receptor at maximum levels (22Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1979; 282: 615-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 23Knowles B.B. Howe C.C. Aden D.P.

HepG2 cells have characteristics similar to normal liver parenchymal cells (22Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B.

Cell. 1986; 10: 37-47Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (252) Google Scholar). HBV particles bind to HepG2 cells in a saturable manner but are refractive to virus replication, probably due to the inability of the incoming virus to reach the nucleus in order to gain access to the cellular transcriptional machinery (25Pontisso P. Ruvoletto M.G. Gerlich W.H. Heermann K.H. Bardini R. Alberti A. Virology. 1989; 173: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The binding of viral particles to HepG2 may be prevented by HBV preS1-(21–47) peptide or anti-preS1-(21–47) antibodies (3Neurath A.R. Kent S.B.H. Strick N. Parker K. Cell. 1986; 46: 429-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 4Qiao M. Macnaughton T.B. Gowans E.J.

Virol. 1992; 73: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that this sequence could be directly responsible for HBV attachment to the cellular surface (26Neurath A.R. Kent S.B.H. Strick N. Taylor P. Stevens C.E. Nature. 1985; 315: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To identify the protein responsible for HBV attachment to HepG2 cells, in this study we have developed a tetrameric form of the preS1-(21–47) peptide in order to increase its functional affinity. This peptide has been used to determine optimal conditions for the detergent solubilization of HepG2 plasma membranes (PM) and as a ligand to fractionate solubilized HepG2 PM extracts by affinity chromatography. By this procedure, a 44-kDa protein has been purified, which has been then cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli to characterize its functional activity. Its role as a cellular receptor for HBV has been studied in transfected CHO and HepG2 cells with the corresponding cDNA. We have analyzed the effect of overexpression of this protein in mammalian cells on virus particle binding and the inhibitory effects of the recombinant protein and corresponding polyclonal antibodies on HBV binding and internalization in transfected cells and primary human hepatocytes. Peptide synthesis was performed following the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/N-hydroxybenzotriazole methodology on a fully automated 431A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). The 4-preS1-(21–47) peptide was prepared in a tetrameric form starting from a polylysine core on a 4-(hydroxymethyl)phenoxyacetic resin. After completion of the synthesis cycles, peptide resins were dried overnight under vacuum; peptides were cleaved from resins using trifluoroacetic acid/phenol/thioanisole/H2O/triisopropylsilane (83:6:5:4:2; 5 ml/200 mg of resin), incubating at room temperature for 3.0 h. After synthesis and deblocking from the resins, peptide was purified by extensive dialysis against acetic acid using a membrane with a cut-off of 12,000 Da. The peptides were characterized by analytical HPLC, amino acid analysis, and time-of-flight matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry. Synthetic myristyl-preS1 (adw2 subtype) was prepared as previously described (27Ruvo M. De Falco S. Verdoliva A. Scarallo A. Fassina G. Peptides. 1999; 97: 537-538Google Scholar, 28De Falco S. Ruvo M. Verdoliva A. Scarallo A. Raimondo D. Raucci A. Fassina G. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 57: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HepG2 PM were prepared by the method of Hubbard (29Hubbard A.L. Wall D.A. Ma A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) with few modifications. The protein concentration of PM preparations was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, and bovine serum albumin was used as standard protein. PM were characterized by their enzymatic activity by measuring 5′-nucleotidase activity, an enzyme marker for the plasma membranes (Sigma Kit 265-UV, following the manufacturer's instructions), and glucose-6-phosphatase activity (30Burchell A. Hume R. Burchell B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 173: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), an enzyme marker of endoplasmic reticulum. 100 μl of HepG2 PM preparations (2 mg/ml) were incubated with detergents such as Tween 20, Triton X-100, or SDS at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1% (v/v) for 1 h at 4 or 25 °C. After incubation, the samples were diluted with PBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5) and centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 rpm, and the soluble fraction was recovered. To test the effect of acidic conditions, a 100-μl sample of Triton-solubilized HepG2 PM fraction (1.8 mg/ml) was incubated with 900 μl of acetic acid 0.1 m or glycine 0.1 mfor 1 h at 25 °C. Samples were then neutralized with NaOH and tested for functionality by RIAs with 125I-4-preS1-(21–47) (see below). HBV synthetic antigens preS1-(21–47) and 4-preS1-(21–47) were iodinated with Bolton and Hunter reagent,N-succinimidyl 3-(4-hydroxy, 5-[125I]iodophenyl)propionate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 5–20 μg of polypeptides were mixed with 1 mCi of reagent in 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5, and incubated under gentle agitation overnight at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine 0.2 m, and nonincorporated reagent was removed by ultrafiltration on Microcon R300 (Amicon); the125I incorporation was checked by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The specific activity of the labeled polypeptides was 8 × 106 cpm/μg for 4-preS1-(21–47) peptide and 1.5 × 106 cpm/μg for preS1-(21–47) peptide. Polystyrene microtiter plates were coated with HepG2 or control PM in PBS overnight at room temperature. The plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then blocked with a 10% solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 6 h at room temperature. Plates were washed again with PBS-T, labeled polypeptides were added, and binding reactions were performed overnight at room temperature. The unbound polypeptides were removed by washing with PBS-T, and the radioactivity associated with the wells was measured (γ-counter Isomedic 10/600 ICN). Affinity column with immobilized 4-preS1-(21–47) peptide was prepared by incubating 10 mg of peptide ligand dissolved in 10 ml of 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, with 1.0 g of CH-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) under gentle agitation for 24 h at room temperature. The extent of ligand incorporation was monitored by reverse phase HPLC and was close to 95%. HepG2 PM have been solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C, and soluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was diluted in loading buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) to reach a final concentration of 500 μg/ml before loading on the 4-preS1-(21–47)-Sepharose affinity column, equilibrated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with loading buffer. After elution of unretained material, the eluent was changed to 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.2, to elute bound proteins. The extent of purification was followed by RIAs and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The bound fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, concentrated on Microcon R300 (Amicon), and then digested with trypsin (1:500 (w/w) enzyme/protein ratio) for 1 h at room temperature. The extent of trypsin degradation was followed by reverse phase HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture using a linear acetonitrile gradient (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) ranging from 5 to 60% in 50 min on a RP-8 column (Aquapore) and monitored at 225 nm. Peaks eluted were collected, lyophilized, and submitted to automated sequencing (model 477A connected to a PTH-amino acid analyzer model 120A; Applied Biosystems). Total RNA from HepG2 was extracted by cell lysis with guanidinium isothiocyanate, and mRNA fraction was purified using the oligotex kit (Qiagen). First strand of cDNA was synthesized (Superscript II kit; Life Technologies, Inc.) and used to isolate HBV-BP cDNA by nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) (all of the oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Life Technologies). PCR-1 was performed with the first primer pair (primer-1 (sense) (5′-CACAGGAGTTCCAGATCACATCGAG) and primer-2 (antisense) (5′-CTGGAAGAAAAAGTACATTTATATGTGGGC), complementary to −31/−7 and +1355/+1384 regions of squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1) mRNA, respectively) and Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Purified PCR-1 products were used as template for a more internal pair of primers in PCR-2 (primer-3 (sense) (5′-GTTCACCATGAATTCACTCAGTGAAGCC); primer-4 (antisense) (5′-GCAATCAGTTTACCAGAACATCTGCAG) complementary to −7/+21 and +1212/+1238 regions of SCCA1 mRNA, respectively) performed withPwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to obtain blunt end amplified products that were used directly in ligation with pUC18 vector digested with SmaI restriction endonuclease. XL1-blue-MRF′ (Stratagene) CaCl2-competent cells have been transformed with ligated DNA and plated on LB plates containing ampicillin, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for selection of recombinant white colonies. The sequence of the insert of the constructed plasmid pUC18/HBV-BP was determined using the AmpliTaq FS Prism ready reaction cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) electrophoresed and assembled on a 373 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The HBV-BP cDNA was cloned in the expression vector pET21a (Novagen). The vector was digested with NdeI, which generates a 3′ protruding extremity, digested with T4 DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to obtain blunt ends, and then digested with BamHI endonucleases. To obtain the HBV-BP cDNA with compatible ends for cloning and to place the ATG start codon of HBV-BP cDNA in the right context with respect to the ribosome binding site carried by the vector, the pUC18/HBV-BP plasmid was used as template for a PCR performed with the following primer pair: primer (sense), 5′-CATGAATTCACTCAGTGAAGCCAAC-3′ (complementary to −1/+24 HBV-BP cDNA) and the universal sequencing primer M13 as antisense primer to amplify also the vector polylinker sequence that carries a recognition sequence for BamHI endonuclease located immediately at the 3′ side of the HBV-BP cDNA insert. The reaction was performed with Pwo DNA polymerase to obtain blunt end products. The amplified product was BamHI-digested and ligated with the pET21a vector. The ligation product was then used to transform the E. coli XL1-blue-MRF′ strain (Stratagene). The sequence of the insert of the constructed plasmid pET21a/HBV-BP was determined as described above. The constructed expression vector pET21a/HBV-BP was then used to transform the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) suitable for expression. A single transformed BL21 (DE3) bacterial colony was inoculated in 25 ml of LB broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and grown at 37 °C for 20 h to obtain a saturated culture. This culture was added to 1 liter of LB containing ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C. At A600 = 0.6, the expression of foreign protein was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the culture was incubated at 30 °C. The maximal level of recombinant protein production was reached after 3 h from the induction. The bacteria were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with PBS buffer. The recovered pellet was resuspended in PBS (4 ml/300 mg, wet weight) and sonicated with the Ultrasonic W-380, with the immersion probe microtip 419A, f 4.8 mm (Heat Systems Ultrasonics), with the following parameters: boost, 1′; duty cycle, 40%; output power, 4. The sonication was stopped at 95–98% of lysis of the bacteria, as checked with an optical microscope. The crude bacterial extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g, at 4 °C, for 30 min, to separate the soluble from the insoluble fraction. The soluble fraction was dialyzed against 20 mmMES, pH 6 (buffer A), and the protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit. The dialyzed soluble fraction was diluted in buffer A to reach a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. A glass column (25 × 0.5-cm inner diameter) (Omnifit) was filled with anionic exchange Source 30S resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); the prepared column was equilibrated at a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min with buffer A. The diluted soluble fraction was loaded on the column, and following the elution of unretained material, a gradient from 0 to 100% of buffer B (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.5 mNaCl) in 20 min was applied to elute bound proteins. The retained fraction was recovered and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.5. The purified fraction of rHBV-BP was stored at −80 °C. Polyclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with 350 μg of rHBV-BP in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted every 3 weeks with the same dose of protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Serum was collected, and the IgG fraction was purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. The polyclonal antibody anti-HBV-BP was then purified by affinity chromatography on rHBV-BP-Sepharose columns. Preimmune serum, after protein A purification, was used in control experiments. Polystirene microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with rHBV-BP at 10 μg/ml (100 μl/well) in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.8, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed three times with PBS buffer, and the wells were saturated with 200 μl of 3% dried milk in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to block uncoated plastic surface. Plates were then washed three times with 0.5% dried milk in PBS buffer (PBS-M); myristyl-preS1 was added at different concentrations (0.2–20 μg/ml in PBS-M, 100 μl/well) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed six times, and an anti-preS1 monoclonal antibody (T0606; Sorin Biomedica) was added at 1 μg/ml in PBS-M, 100 μl/well. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C and subsequent washing, wells were filled with 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse (Sigma) solution diluted 1000-fold with PBS-M. The plates were left to stand for 1 h at 37 °C, washed six times, and then filled with 120 μl ofo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) chromogenic substrate solution freshly prepared according to protocols from the manufacturer. The color was allowed to develop for 20 min, and theA450 was determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay plate reader. Photometric substrates,Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine andN-benzoyl-l-tyrosine, were diluted in PBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.5) and were used with the enzymes α-chymotrypsin and trypsin, respectively. The fluorogenic substrate, used with the enzymes cathepsin L and papain, was diluted in the enzyme reaction buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. The fluorogenic substrate was a bisamide derivative of rhodamine 110, bis-(CBZ-l-phenylalanyl-l-arginine amide), dihydrochloride (Rh110). The amount of the monoamide liberated was determined fluorometrically with excitation and emission wavelengths of 499 and 521 nm, respectively, using a Shimadzu spectrofluorimetric detector, model RF-551. Protease inhibition by rHBV-BP was determined by use of a continuous assay procedure. Proteases were mixed with different concentrations of rHBV-BP, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in the appropriate reaction buffer, as described. The reaction was started by the addition of protease-specific substrate. The amount of carboxylic acid liberated from the hydrolysis of the photometric substrates was continuously recorded at a fixed wavelength (253 nm forNα-benzoyl-l-arginine and 256 nm for N-benzoyl-l-tyrosine) using a Beckman spectrophotometer, model DU 640. The HBV-BP cDNA was cloned in the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector that allows the selection of G-418 stable clones for the presence of the neomycin gene. The complete insert of pUC18/HBV-BP plasmid was recovered by digestion withKpnI and XbaI endonucleases and ligated in the pcDNA3 vector restricted in the same manner. E. coliXL1-blue-MRF′ (Stratagene) CaCl2-competent cells were transformed with the product of ligation reaction, and the DNA of the resulting recombinant plasmid (pcDNA3/HBV-BP) was prepared (Qiagen Maxi-prep kit). HepG2 and CHO transfections were performed with pcDNA3/HBV-BP DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Two stable clones, HepG2/HBV-BP and CHO/HBV-BP, were selected for the maximal amount of the HBV-BP expression as established by Western blot and RIAs. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, washed with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS, and incubated with polyclonal anti-HBV-BP antibodies at 5 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with the supernatant of hybridoma producing the monoclonal antibody W6/32 (ATCC number HB-95) diluted 1:50 in PBS plus 1% BSA. After 30 min at room temperature, cells were washed again with PBS, and immunoreactivity was visualized by incubation with a mixture of secondary antibodies composed of goat anti-rabbit, conjugated with FITC and goat anti-mouse conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (Sigma), both diluted 1:100 in PBS plus 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. Images were acquired for the different fluorescent emissions and overlapped. Infectious viral particles were obtained under informed consent from serum of a chronically infected patient with HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive serology, in which HBV DNA levels ranged from 3.4 to 1.8 ng/ml (Digene Hybrid Capture HBV DNA Assay) in several occasions. Enriched viral particle preparations were obtained by discontinuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and preS1 protein content was assessed using a previously standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (7Neurath A.R. Strick N. Virology. 1989; 178: 631-634Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All viral particle preparations showed a strong preS1 r"

We investigated mechanistic aspects of this regulation in melanoma cells using a simian virus 40 (SV40)-based in vitro DNA replication assay. Heat shock (44 °C) caused a monotonic inhibition of cellular DNA replication following exposures for 5–90 min. SV40 DNA replication activity in extracts of similarly heated cells also decreased after 5–30 min of exposure, but returned to near control levels after 60–90 min of exposure. This transient inhibition of SV40 DNA replication was eliminated by recombinant replication protein A (rRPA), suggesting a regulatory process targeting this key DNA replication factor. SV40 DNA replication inhibition was associated with a transient increase in the interaction between nucleolin and RPA that peaked at 20–30 min. Because binding to nucleolin compromises the ability of RPA to support SV40 DNA replication, we suggest that the observed interaction reflects a mechanism whereby DNA replication is regulated after heat shock. The relevance of this interaction to the regulation of cellular DNA replication is indicated by the transient translocation in heated cells of nucleolin from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm with kinetics very similar to those of SV40 DNA replication inhibition and of RPA-nucleolin interaction. Because the targeting of RPA by nucleolin in heated cells occurs in an environment that preserves the activity of several essential DNA replication factors, active processes may contribute to DNA replication inhibition to a larger degree than presently thought. RPA-nucleolin interactions may reflect an early step in the regulation of DNA replication, as nucleolin relocalized into the nucleolus 1–2 h after heat exposure but cellular DNA replication remained inhibited for up to 8 h. We propose that the nucleolus functions as a heat sensor that uses nucleolin as a signaling molecule to initiate inhibitory responses equivalent to a checkpoint.

Although the mechanisms regulating DNA replication after DNA damage are studied intensively and a considerable amount of information is now available (reviewed in Ref.1Zhou B.-B.S. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar), the mechanisms that regulate DNA replication in response to other types of stress, such as heat stress, are much less studied and understood. However, heat stress severely compromises cellular function and survival, constitutes a likely event in the life cycle of an organism, and is a form of stress organisms had to deal with during evolution.It is well documented that exposure of cells to heat strongly inhibits DNA replication, and it is thought that this inhibition underlies the increased heat sensitivity of S-phase cells, as compared with cells in G1 or G2 (2Dewey W.C.

Indeed, heat inhibits several nuclear processes associated with semiconservative replication of DNA including the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into acid-insoluble material (10Henle K.J.

It is possible that the observed inhibition is a passive consequence of heat-induced inactivation of DNA replication factors, as well as of damage induced in chromatin by the precipitation of denatured protein on the nuclear matrix (14Warters R.L. Radiat. Res. 1988; 115: 258-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Warters R.L. Lyons B.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Roti Roti J.L.

Alternatively, however, some of the inhibitory effects could be the consequence of a process, equivalent to a checkpoint, which actively stalls DNA replication to prevent grave errors and facilitate repair, much the way ionizing radiation inhibits replicon initiation by activating the ataxia telangiectasia mutated pathway (1Zhou B.-B.S. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar, 19Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 20Iliakis G. Semin.

Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 25-45PubMed Google Scholar).In an effort to characterize putative regulatory components of DNA replication in cells exposed to heat, we introduced the simian virus 40 (SV40)1-based in vitro DNA replication assay. In this assay, the replication of plasmids carrying the SV40 origin of DNA replication (ori) is accomplished in vitro using either crude cytoplasmic extracts from human cells, or proteins purified from such extracts (22Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 23Wobbe C.R. Dean F. Weissbach L. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Only one protein of viral origin is required, the SV40 large tumor antigen. The assay provides a well controlled and molecularly defined system to study regulatory aspects of DNA replication, and allows the separation of regulatory effects targeting DNA replication factors from effects of heat on the substrate DNA.Using this assay we reported (27Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that cytoplasmic extracts prepared from heated cells had a reduced DNA replication activity, as compared with extracts prepared from non-heated cells, and that this reduction in DNA replication activity was specifically caused by an inactivation of replication protein A (RPA) (28Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Murakami Y. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1834-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 29Fairman M.P. Stillman B.

Addition of recombinant RPA (rRPA) in these reactions completely reversed the inhibition. Because RPA levels were similar in extracts of heated and non-heated cells and because RPA was relatively resistant to direct heat inactivation, we proposed that the observed response reflected the activation of a checkpoint that targeted and inactivated RPA. A regulatory role for RPA in DNA replication has also been suggested in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (31Wang Y. Huq M.S. Iliakis G. Radiat.

Several of these interactions and modifications are compatible with a regulatory function for RPA in DNA replication, and with a role in the cellular responses to DNA damage, although direct evidence is still lacking.Because significant phosphorylation of RPA2 was not observed after exposure to heat, it was speculated that if RPA is a target of processes regulating DNA replication, it should be modified by mechanisms other than phosphorylation (27Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been presented that interaction with nucleolin, a major nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and diverse other biological processes (for reviews, see Refs. 56Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 407-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 57Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can regulate the replication functions of RPA (58Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Here, we extend our studies on the regulation of DNA replication in cells exposed to heat shock and inquire whether the previously reported effects of heat on in vitro DNA replication and the associated inactivation of RPA (27Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) derive from an interaction with nucleolin. The results demonstrate RPA-nucleolin interactions perfectly correlating with in vitro DNA replication activity and suggest that this interaction reflects an early step of the cellular response to heat stress. DNA replication is at the center of the eukaryotic cell cycle, and its regulation under conditions of stress, or after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, is under the control of intricate pathways that are only now beginning to be characterized. Although the mechanisms regulating DNA replication after DNA damage are studied intensively and a considerable amount of information is now available (reviewed in Ref.1Zhou B.-B.S. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar), the mechanisms that regulate DNA replication in response to other types of stress, such as heat stress, are much less studied and understood. However, heat stress severely compromises cellular function and survival, constitutes a likely event in the life cycle of an organism, and is a form of stress organisms had to deal with during evolution. It is well documented that exposure of cells to heat strongly inhibits DNA replication, and it is thought that this inhibition underlies the increased heat sensitivity of S-phase cells, as compared with cells in G1 or G2 (2Dewey W.C.

Although the above studies identify heat-sensitive steps of DNA replication, they provide only limited information as to the molecular mechanism(s) involved. It is possible that the observed inhibition is a passive consequence of heat-induced inactivation of DNA replication factors, as well as of damage induced in chromatin by the precipitation of denatured protein on the nuclear matrix (14Warters R.L. Radiat. Res. 1988; 115: 258-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Warters R.L. Lyons B.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 142: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Roti Roti J.L.

Alternatively, however, some of the inhibitory effects could be the consequence of a process, equivalent to a checkpoint, which actively stalls DNA replication to prevent grave errors and facilitate repair, much the way ionizing radiation inhibits replicon initiation by activating the ataxia telangiectasia mutated pathway (1Zhou B.-B.S. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar, 19Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 20Iliakis G. Semin.

In an effort to characterize putative regulatory components of DNA replication in cells exposed to heat, we introduced the simian virus 40 (SV40)1-based in vitro DNA replication assay. In this assay, the replication of plasmids carrying the SV40 origin of DNA replication (ori) is accomplished in vitro using either crude cytoplasmic extracts from human cells, or proteins purified from such extracts (22Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 23Wobbe C.R. Dean F. Weissbach L. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Only one protein of viral origin is required, the SV40 large tumor antigen. The assay provides a well controlled and molecularly defined system to study regulatory aspects of DNA replication, and allows the separation of regulatory effects targeting DNA replication factors from effects of heat on the substrate DNA. Using this assay we reported (27Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that cytoplasmic extracts prepared from heated cells had a reduced DNA replication activity, as compared with extracts prepared from non-heated cells, and that this reduction in DNA replication activity was specifically caused by an inactivation of replication protein A (RPA) (28Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Murakami Y. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1834-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 29Fairman M.P. Stillman B.

Addition of recombinant RPA (rRPA) in these reactions completely reversed the inhibition. Because RPA levels were similar in extracts of heated and non-heated cells and because RPA was relatively resistant to direct heat inactivation, we proposed that the observed response reflected the activation of a checkpoint that targeted and inactivated RPA. A regulatory role for RPA in DNA replication has also been suggested in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (31Wang Y. Huq M.S. Iliakis G. Radiat.

RPA is an essential component of eukaryotic DNA metabolism and has activity as the primary single-stranded DNA-binding protein (for reviews, see Refs. 36Wold M.S. Annu. Rev.

RPA2 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and in response to DNA damage, but the regulatory significance of these phosphorylations has not been established (36Wold M.S. Annu. Rev.

Several of these interactions and modifications are compatible with a regulatory function for RPA in DNA replication, and with a role in the cellular responses to DNA damage, although direct evidence is still lacking. Because significant phosphorylation of RPA2 was not observed after exposure to heat, it was speculated that if RPA is a target of processes regulating DNA replication, it should be modified by mechanisms other than phosphorylation (27Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been presented that interaction with nucleolin, a major nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and diverse other biological processes (for reviews, see Refs. 56Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 407-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 57Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), can regulate the replication functions of RPA (58Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here, we extend our studies on the regulation of DNA replication in cells exposed to heat shock and inquire whether the previously reported effects of heat on in vitro DNA replication and the associated inactivation of RPA (27Wang Y. Perrault A.R. Iliakis G. Radiat. Res. 1998; 149: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) derive from an interaction with nucleolin. The results demonstrate RPA-nucleolin interactions perfectly correlating with in vitro DNA replication activity and suggest that this interaction reflects an early step of the cellular response to heat stress.

However, β1AR can internalize as G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is fused to its carboxyl terminus. Internalization of the β1AR and GRK2 fusion protein (β1AR/GRK2) is dependent on dynamin but independent of β-arrestin and phosphorylation. The β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein internalizes via clathrin-coated pits and is found to co-localize with the endosome that contains transferrin. The fusion proteins consisting of β1AR and various portions of GRK2 reveal that the residues 498–502 in the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 are critical to promote internalization of the fusion proteins. This domain contains a consensus sequence of a clathrin-binding motif defined as a clathrin box. In vitro binding assays show that the residues 498–502 of GRK2 bind the amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain to almost the same extent as β-arrestin1. The mutation of the clathrin box in the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 results in the loss of the ability to promote internalization of the fusion protein. GRK2 activity increases and then decreases as the concentration of clathrin heavy chain increases. Taken together, these results imply that GRK2 contains a functional clathrin box and directly interacts with clathrin to modulate its function. β1-Adrenergic receptor (β1AR) shows the resistance to agonist-induced internalization.

Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Within seconds to minutes after agonist stimulation, β2AR is phosphorylated by GRKs and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Subsequent binding of β-arrestins to the GRK-phosphorylated β2AR inhibits coupling of β2AR with Gs. The agonist-bound β2AR is also internalized from the plasma membrane to the intracellular endosome via clathrin-coated pits in a time period similar to that of uncoupling. Internalization is the process that contributes to functional resensitization by promoting dephosphorylation and recycling of the receptor to the plasma membrane (2Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that internalization contributes not only to uncoupling and recycling of receptors but also to down-regulation by promoting degradation of the receptors in lysosomes (4Kallal L.

Overexpression of GRK2 enhanced internalization of m2AChR, whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative GRK2 inhibited it (8Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of GRK2 rescued agonist-promoted internalization of the internalization-defective β2AR mutant (Y326A β2AR), whereas the β2AR mutant lacking putative GRK2 phosphorylation sites was not internalized (9Ferguson S.S.G. Ménard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A-M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Overexpression of β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 rescued internalization of Y326A β2AR, whereas dominant-negative β-arrestins inhibited internalization of WT-β2AR (10Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). These results show that GRK and β-arrestin play an essential role in internalization of some GPCRs. It has been reported that β-arrestins promote internalization by interacting not only with GPCRs but also with clathrin, the major component of the clathrin-based endocytic machinery (11Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). β-Arrestins bind clathrin by interaction of a consensus clathrin-binding motif in the carboxyl-terminal domain with the amino-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain (12Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The formation of vesicles for transport is mediated by coat proteins associated with integral membrane proteins (13Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The clathrin-coated vesicle is the most characterized example, which consists mainly of clathrin and protein complexes termed adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) that forms at the plasma membrane when membrane receptors internalize (14Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The regulatory proteins such as β-arrestins and amphiphysins, which have been demonstrated to interact with clathrin, have conserved sequences within the clathrin-binding regions (12Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 14Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Alignment of these sequences defines a consensus motif for clathrin binding that consists of acidic and bulky hydrophobic residues and conforms to the canonical sequence L(L/I)(D/E/N)(L/F)(D/E). This region can bind to the amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain (16Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15017-15022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In contrast with β2AR, β1AR undergoes only slight internalization upon agonist stimulation (17Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Namtel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). A lower affinity of β-arrestins for β1AR than for β2AR can explain the differential behavior of internalization between β1AR and β2AR. We determined the interaction of β-arrestins with β1AR by several methods, and we found that β1AR has a lower affinity for β-arrestins than β2AR (18Shiina T. Kawasaki A. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the course of analysis of the resistance of β1AR to agonist-induced internalization, we have found that the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein internalized upon agonist stimulation, which was independent of β-arrestins but dependent on dynamin. This unique internalization behavior of the fusion protein turned out to be due to the existence of clathrin box in GRK2. In the present study, we demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 contains a consensus motif of clathrin binding shared with β-arrestins, amphiphysins, and AP-2. GRK2 directly interacts with clathrin via this clathrin-binding motif, and the phosphorylating ability of GRK2 is regulated by clathrin binding. It suggests that GRK2 participates in agonist-promoted internalization in more direct ways.

Pharmacol. 1996; 315: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The β1- and β2AR/GRK2 fusion proteins were constructed as follows. First, various coding regions of GRK2 were amplified by two primers, which had restriction sites of SpeI or HindIII. The identity of the sequence of the PCR products was confirmed by thermal cycling sequencing kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Then the entire coding region of GRK2 was ligated with β1- or β2ARs without a stop codon into EcoRI andHindIII of pRK5 by help of two oligonucleotides GATCCAGGAGGAGGAA and CTAGTTCCTCCTCCTG. Because of these oligonucleotides, there are extra amino acids between GRK2 and each of receptors (Asp-Pro-Gly-Gly-Gly-Thr-Ser for β1AR and Gly-Pro-Gly-Gly-Gly-Thr-Ser for β2AR). The coding region of the carboxyl-terminal domain including stop codon of GRK2 (Asp457–Leu689) was amplified and ligated intoBamHI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T1. The entire coding region including stop codon of β-arrestin1 was amplified and ligated into EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T1.

(Tokyo). 2000; 127: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were purified and concentrated by Centricon-30 as described (18Shiina T. Kawasaki A. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were cultured and transfected as described (18Shiina T. Kawasaki A. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 µg/ml gentamicin. The cells were seeded at density of 2 × 105 cells for 6-well plates or 2 × 106 cells for 100-mm dishes before the day of transfection. Then appropriate amounts of plasmids (2 µg for 6-well plates or 8 µg for 100-mm dishes) were used for transfection with 5 or 20 µl of LipofectAMINE, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used for assays 2 days after transfection. The binding activities of βARs expressing in HEK293 cells were determined as described (18Shiina T. Kawasaki A. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells expressing βARs in 6-well plates that had been transiently transfected were incubated at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM with or without 10 µm isoproterenol for the indicated time. Cells were washed three times by ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 6 nm[3H]CGP-12177 in the modified KRH buffer (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mmMgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then the cell-associated radioactivities were counted. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 10 µmpropranolol. Inhibition of endocytosis was performed by maintaining cells in the medium (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5m sucrose for hypertonic shock, 10 mm acetic acid for cytosol acidification or 0.25 mg/ml concanavalin A for cross-linking of lectin). Cells were washed once with one of the above mentioned medium and incubated for 30 min in the same medium. Then cells were stimulated by 10 µm isoproterenol for 30 min. Inhibition of endocytosis was also performed by transient transfection with plasmids encoding dominant-negative dynamin (dynamin K44A) or dominant-negative β-arrestin2 (β-arrestin2-(284–409)). The expression levels of βARs in the present study were 1080 ± 103 fmol/mg (WT-β1AR), 742 ± 93 fmol/mg (β1AR/GRK2), 694 ± 51 fmol/mg (WT-β2AR), and 497 ± 83 fmol/mg (β2AR/GRK2). Phosphorylation of β2AR, β1AR, and the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein was performed with a slight modification of Kurose and Lefkowitz (21Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 69: 10093-10099Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transiently expressing βARs were labeled with 100 µCi/ml [32P]PO4 for 1 h in serum- and phosphate-free DMEM. The cells were then stimulated by 10 µm isoproterenol for 10 min, and after extensive washing cells were scraped into buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate) containing 10 µg/ml benzamidine, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The βARs were solubilized by stirring for 1 h at 4 °C and were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The solubilized βARs were incubated with 2 µg of anti-HA antibody and immunoprecipitated by incubating with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. The immunoprecipitated receptors were separated from protein A-Sepharose by incubating them at 37 °C for 30 min and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated receptors were detected with Fuji BAS 1800. Confocal microscopy was performed as described (18Shiina T. Kawasaki A. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with the epitope-tagged and GRK2-fused β1AR. Cells expressing the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein were plated onto 35-mm glass bottom dishes. On the day of experiment, the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were then incubated for 30 min with 40 µg/ml Alexa FluorTM594-conjugated transferrin. After transferrin was endocytosed, cells were stimulated by 10 µm isoproterenol for 30 min. Cells were washed, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and HA epitope at the amino terminus of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein was detected by rat anti HA-antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat antibody. Confocal images were obtained with two excitation wavelengths, 488 nm for β1AR/GRK2 and 546 nm for transferrin. Signals were collected with a Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging System from Bio-Rad using Nikon CFI PLN APOCHROMAT 60× WI lens. The β1AR/GRK2 was localized on the plasma membrane before agonist stimulation (data not shown). A cDNA fragment encoding residues 1–580 of human clathrin heavy chain was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using ThermoscriptTM and Pfx DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR product was subcloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of the pBluescript SKII (−) vector and sequenced. The resulting amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain was transcribed and translated in vitro using TNT quick-coupled transcription/translation system in the presence ofl-[35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads by incubating for 60 min at 4 °C and then incubated for 60 min with in vitro translated clathrin in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C. After washing five times with the binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The radiolabeled clathrin was detected by autoradiography and quantified by Fuji BAS 1800. GRK2 and m2AChR were expressed in Sf9 cells with the baculovirus expression method (22Haga K. Tsuga H. Haga T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GRK2 eluted from the heparin column was stored at −80 °C after the addition of a half-volume of glycerol. m2AChR was purified by affinity column chromatography and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles as described. The amino-terminal region of clathrin heavy chain used for the in vitro β-arrestin binding experiment was inserted into pGEX-4T1. The resulting fusion protein was expressed and purified by the same way as GST-GRK2CT fusion proteins. Phosphorylation of m2AChR by GRK2 was performed by the incubation in buffer (10 µm ATP, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 40 nm GRK2, 1 µl of purified m2AChR, and 2.5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP) in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of GST-clathrin heavy chain or GST alone in a total volume of 30 µl. The reaction was stopped after 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the radioactive m2AChR was detected and quantified by Fuji BAS 1800. We have determined agonist-induced internalization by measuring the numbers of WT-βARs or the βAR/GRK2 fusion proteins remaining at the cell surface. Consistent with the previous report (17Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Namtel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar,18Shiina T. Kawasaki A. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29082-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26215-26219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the number of β1ARs was not decreased although the number of β2ARs was decreased about 30% by isoproterenol stimulation for 30 min (Fig.1). In contrast with WT-β1AR, the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein that GRK2 was fused to at the carboxyl terminus of β1AR was internalized by isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 1 A). The β2AR/GRK2 fusion protein internalized to a much greater extent than WT-β2AR (Fig. 1 B). As receptor phosphorylation plays a central role in agonist-induced internalization (9Ferguson S.S.G. Ménard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A-M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we determined the phosphorylation states of β2AR, β1AR, and β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein. When β2AR was expressed in HEK293 cells, β2AR showed the increased phosphorylation by agonist stimulation (Fig.2A). Under the same conditions, β1AR was also phosphorylated by agonist stimulation, although the degree of phosphorylation was much smaller than that of β2AR. In contrast to β1AR, β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein was efficiently phosphorylated by agonist stimulation (Fig. 2 B). This result suggests that β1AR has a lower affinity for GRK2 than β2AR. It also raises the possibility that the enhanced internalization of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein is caused in part by the increased phosphorylation of β1AR.Figure 2Phosphorylation of β2AR, β1AR and β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein. HEK293 cells transiently expressing β2AR and β1AR (A) or β1AR and β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein (B) were labeled with [32P]PO4 and stimulated by 10 µm isoproterenol. The receptors were solubilized, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The experiments were repeated three times, and similar results were obtained. The expression levels of βARs were 59 ± 12 fmol/mg (none), 370 ± 120 fmol/mg (β2AR), 340 ± 100 fmol/mg (β1AR), and 340 ± 59 fmol/mg (β1AR/GRK2) of three experiments in duplicate.A, β2AR but not β1AR was strongly phosphorylated by isoproterenol (Iso) stimulation.B, the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein was also phosphorylated by isoproterenol stimulation, and no phosphorylation was observed in control HEK293 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the increased phosphorylation of the receptor recruits β-arrestins to promote internalization of the receptor, we determined whether the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein was internalized via β-arrestin- and dynamin-dependent pathways. The carboxyl-terminal domains of β-arrestins interact with clathrin and AP-2 and promote internalization of the agonist-bound and -phosphorylated receptors (24Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Therefore, the carboxyl-terminal domains of β-arrestins (for instance β-arrestin2-(284–409)) can behave as dominant-negative mutants. Dynamin is a GTPase that pinches off the vesicles at the necks of clathrin-coated pits and is therefore essential for the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (25Damke H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Therefore, dynamin mutating at Lys44 that is important for GTP binding (dynamin K44A) works as a dominant-negative mutant. As shown in Fig. 3A, overexpression of β-arrestin2-(284–409) and dynamin K44A significantly attenuated agonist-promoted internalization of β2AR. In consistent with β2AR, dynamin K44A completely prevented agonist-promoted internalization of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein (Fig. 3 B). However, β-arrestin2-(284–409) was without effect on internalization of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein. Consistent with the inability of β-arrestin2-(284–409) to inhibit internalization, stimulation of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein did not translocate β-arrestin2-enhanced green fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane (data not shown). Internalization of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein was not inhibited by a dominant negative β-arrestin2 mutant (β-arrestin2-(284–409)), and stimulation of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein did not translocate β-arrestin2-enhanced green fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane. Therefore, it is concluded that the enhanced phosphorylation of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein (shown in Fig. 2) does not result in the increased binding of β-arrestins. These results also suggested that the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein internalizes via a dynamin-dependent but β-arrestin-independent pathway. Next we examined the contribution of GRK2 fusion on the internalization behavior of β2AR that efficiently internalizes upon agonist stimulation. The effect of GRK2-induced phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding on internalization was blocked by the expression of β-arrestin2-(284–409). Therefore, we can determine the contribution of GRK2 fusion to internalization. β-Arrestin2-(284–409) almost completely blocked internalization of β2AR. However, β-arrestin2-(284–409) partially inhibited internalization of the β2AR/GRK2 fusion protein (Fig. 3 C). This result suggests that GRK2 induces internalization by itself in a phosphorylation-independent manner when GRK2 is fused to the receptors. This result also indicates that the β2AR/GRK2 fusion protein internalizes via at least two pathways. To examine whether internalization of the fusion protein is dependent on clathrin, internalization via clathrin-coated pits was blocked by various treatments (27Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 28Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation with isoproterenol for 30 min promoted internalization of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein by ∼30% (Fig. 4). However, the incubation with 0.5 m sucrose, 0.25 mg/ml concanavalin A, or acetic acid resulted in the blockade of internalization of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein. Taken together, these results indicate that β1AR can be internalized when GRK2 was fused to the carboxyl terminus of β1AR and that internalization of the fusion protein is dependent on clathrin and dynamin but independent of β-arrestin.Figure 4Inhibition of the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles blocks internalization of β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein in HEK293 cells. The formation of clathrin-coated vesicles was inhibited by hypertonic sucrose (Sucrose), concanavalin A (Con A), or cytosolic acidification (Acid) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were stimulated by 10 µm isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C and then incubated with [3H]CGP-12177. The data are represented as described in the legend of Fig. 1. The data show mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the subcellular localization of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein after agonist stimulation, we performed confocal microscopy to compare the localization of the fusion protein with that of transferrin, a well established marker of early and recycling endosomes (29Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 30Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In the resting state, the fusion protein was localized at the plasma membrane and showed the different distributions from transferrin that was internalized and accumulated in early endosomes (data not shown). After agonist stimulation, the fusion protein appeared in endocytic vesicles that were randomly distributed throughout cytosol and co-localized with transferrin (Fig.5, co-localization is shown by the appearance of the yellow color when the greencolor is coincident with the red color). This observation supports the idea that the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein is really internalized by agonist stimulation and sorted to endocytic vesicles containing transferrin. To determine which region of GRK2 is responsible for differential behavior of agonist-promoted internalization of the fusion protein, we constructed various β1AR/GRK2 mutants and determined the internalization behavior of them. The structures of β1AR/GRK2 mutants are shown in Fig. 6A. Fig.6 B shows the internalization behavior of the fusion proteins that various parts of GRK2 are fused at the carboxyl terminus of β1AR. When the amino-terminal domain or the catalytic domain of GRK2 was fused to the carboxyl terminus of β1AR, these fusion proteins did not show agonist-promoted internalization (Fig. 6 B). The β1AR/GRK2 mutants that contained the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 showed enhanced internalization, although the extent of internalization was not the same as that of β1AR/GRK2. This result suggests that the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 is necessary to promote internalization of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion protein. After searching a motif for internalization in the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2, we found a potential clathrin-binding motif LLDSD at positions 498–502. We suspected that direct interaction of the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 with clathrin promoted internalization of β1AR when the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 was fused to β1AR. Therefore, we mutated the amino acids in this region to alanine residues (Fig. 6 A). When498LLDSD502 in the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 was mutated to alanine and fused to the β1AR, this mutant did not internalize upon agonist stimulation (Fig.6 B). This result raised the possibility that498LLDSD502 in GRK2 played an essential role in agonist-promoted internalization of the β1AR/GRK2 fusion proteins by direct interaction with clathrin. The results in the previous sections indicate that GRK2 directly interacts with clathrin via its clathrin-binding motif in the carboxyl-terminal domain. It has been reported that the clathrin-binding motif binds to the amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Therefore, we determined the ability of the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 to bind clathrin. The GST fusion proteins of β-arrestin1 or the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 were individually immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 35S-labeled clathrin generated by in vitrotranslation. The bottom panel of Fig.7A shows the Coomassie gel staining of GST fusion proteins that were used for the clathrin binding experiment. Although β-arrestin1-GST, GRK2CT-GST, and GRK2CT(AAAAA)-GST fusion proteins showed some degradation or truncation products, major bands of these fusion proteins were products of full-length inserts based on molecular weights of these products. Clathrin did not bind to GST alone (upper panel of Fig.7 A). In contrast with GST alone, clathrin bound strongly to β-arrestin1, consistent with the previous report (16Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15017-15022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Clathrin also strongly bound to the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2. When the amino acids of clathrin-binding motif in the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 were mutated to alanine (GRK2CT-498LLDSD502→ GRK2CT-498AAAAA502), the clathrin binding to the carboxyl-terminal domain was greatly decreased (Fig.7 B). Considering the integrity and amounts of three fusion proteins (Fig. 7 A), it is concluded that GRK2CT binds clathrin almost same degree as β-arrestin1, and alanine-substituted GRK2CT mutant binds much less than the other two fusion proteins. These results clearly demonstrate that GRK2 has a clathrin-binding motif in its carboxyl-terminal domain and interacts with clathrin heavy chain through that motif. It has been reported very recently that class II PI3K-C2α is activated by clathrin (31Gaidarov I. Smith M.E.K. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether interaction of GRK2 with clathrin resulted in the enhanced phosphorylation activity of GRK2 toward agonist-bound receptor. As GRK2 can phosphorylate not only β2AR but also m2AChR in vitro and in vivo, m2mAChR was used for in vitro phosphorylation experiments by GRK2. The fusion protein of clathrin heavy chain residues 1–580 with GST was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified from it. The purified preparation was not a full-length product (Fig.8A). Because it has been reported that the amino-terminal portion is essential for interaction with clathrin-binding proteins (31Gaidarov I. Smith M.E.K. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we used this fusion protein for the functional experiment. GRK2 phosphorylated agonist-bound m2AChR to some extent in the absence of any activator (Fig. 8 B). The phosphorylation activity of GRK2 increased and then decreased as the concentration of the clathrin-GST fusion protein increased. This result indicates that clathrin modulates the function of GRK2. In the present study, we demonstrated that GRK2 contains a functional clathrin binding domain. Our results provide GRK2 with a new function other than phosphorylation activity toward activated GPCRs. Many GPCRs are phosphorylated by GRKs in an agonist-dependent manner as a major mechanism of receptor regulation. There are six members of the GRK family (32Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). GRKs belong to the serine/threonine kinase family and show the property to phosphorylate agonist-occupied receptors, thereby triggering desensitization. GRK2 is the primary GRK expressed in the heart and is studied most extensively to date. Phosphorylation of GPCRs by GRK2 and subsequent binding of β-arrestins is one of the mechanisms leading to uncoupling from G proteins. The binding of β-arrestins to almost all GPCRs appears to enhance internalization through interaction of β-arrestins with clathrin and AP-2 (11Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 24Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The vesicles for internalization consist of several proteins, which formed at the plasma membrane. The most extensively characterized proteins in the vesicles are clathrin and the protein complex termed AP-2 (33Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 34Brodsky F.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 175-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Clathrin is the complex of three heavy chains and three light chains that polymerizes to form the cargo for internalization. AP-2 recruits the internalizing membrane proteins to the coated pits and also mediates attachment of clathrin to the membrane. β-Arrestins (12Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J.

These clathrin-interacting proteins have conserved amino acid sequences for clathrin binding. This clathrin-binding motif is defined as a clathrin box that conforms to the canonical sequence L(L/I)(D/E/N)(L/F)(D/E) (Fig. 9). In the present study, we found that GRK2 also has the sequence 498LLDSD502 similar to the canonical sequence of clathrin box in its carboxyl-terminal domain. As AP-2 and β-arrestins bind to the amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain (17Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Namtel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar, 24Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), we determined whether GRK2 also binds to the amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. We found that the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2 bound clathrin essentially the same extent to that of β-arrestin1. These results suggest that clathrin box of GRK2 is functional not only in binding of clathrin but also in enhancement of agonist-promoted internalization. GRK2 is divided into three domains as follows: amino-terminal domain, catalytic domain, and carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain. The amino-terminal domain contains regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) domains specific for Gαq, and the carboxyl-terminal domain contains Gβγ binding domain and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (35Carman C.V.

The present study adds another functional domain to GRK2, which interacts with clathrin and helps agonist-promoted internalization. GPCRs internalize via several pathways. The most characterized and established internalization is the β-arrestin- and dynamin-dependent pathway such as β2AR internalizes. GRK-mediated phosphorylation triggers internalization by promoting the binding of β-arrestins to the phosphorylated receptors and subsequent interaction with clathrin and AP-2. On the contrary, some GPCRs such as angiotensin II receptor and m2AChR internalize via β-arrestin- and dynamin-independent pathway. In contrast to these GPCRs, m1, m3, and m4AChRs internalize via β-arrestin-independent but dynamin-dependent pathway (37Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

Direct interaction of GRK2 with clathrin may be involved in internalization of these mAChRs via dynamin-dependent pathway. Affinity of substance P receptor for GRK2 seems to be higher than that for other GPCRs (39Barak L.S. Warabi K. Feng X. Caron M.G. Kwatra M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7565-7569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), because activation of substance P receptor but not other types of GPCRs including β2AR and angiotensin II receptor induces translocation of GRK2 to the plasma membrane. A plausible explanation for this intriguing observation is that substance P receptor has higher affinity for GRK2 than other GPCRs (39Barak L.S. Warabi K. Feng X. Caron M.G. Kwatra M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7565-7569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, GRK2 translocating to the plasma membrane may directly involve internalization of substance P receptor by interacting with clathrin. Gaidarov et al. (31Gaidarov I. Smith M.E.K. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) reported very recently that clathrin activates the class II PI3K-C2α and regulates membrane trafficking via PI3K-C2α. PI3K is classified into two classes, class I and class II. The class I PI3K is involved in postendocytic trafficking of the receptors and is sensitive to wortmannin and LY294002. PI3K-C2α belongs to class II PI3K and shows the resistance to PI3K inhibitors. Because PI3K-C2α is activated by clathrin and the consequent production of PIP3 can recruit various PIP3-binding proteins, it was proposed that clathrin helps to stimulate endocytosis by the increased formation of PIP3(31Gaidarov I. Smith M.E.K. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that the amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain binds the carboxyl-terminal region of GRK2 and modulates GRK2 phosphorylation activity. GRK2 activity was regulated by clathrin in a bell-shaped manner. Low concentration of clathrin-GST fusion protein increased, and high concentration decreased GRK2 phosphorylation activity. The degree of activation by clathrin-GST fusion protein was lower than that of PI3K-C2α by clathrin complex. One of the possibilities to explain this low activation is that other parts of clathrin help to activate GRK2 upon interaction with GRK2. Another possibility is that the observed GRK2 activity reflects the combined effects of stimulatory and inhibitory regulation by clathrin even at a stimulatory phase. It is not apparent at present which phase (stimulatory or inhibitory) is physiologically important for GRK2-mediated receptor internalization. However, it has been reported that GRK2 phosphorylates a cytoskeletal protein, tubulin, and modulates its function (15Carman C.V. Som T. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20308-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that activation of GRK2 by clathrin results in the enhanced phosphorylation of tubulin and leads to cytoskeletal rearrangement for internalization. Further studies will be necessary for resolving these issues. Our findings imply that GRK2 not only phosphorylates the receptor in an active conformation but also is likely to function as a clathrin adaptor, just like β-arrestins and AP-2. GRK2 may be more directly involved in the sorting events than previously envisioned. In conclusion, we demonstrated that GRK2 directly interacts with clathrin via the clathrin box located at the carboxyl-terminal domain of GRK2. The clathrin box is a consensus motif shared with AP-2, β-arrestins, and amphiphysins to interact with the amino-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Conservation of this motif is likely to account for the ability of all these proteins to bind clathrin despite their structural diversity. Therefore, β1AR could internalize upon agonist stimulation when GRK2 was fused to the carboxyl terminus of β1AR. We thank Dr. R. J. Lefkowitz for providing cDNAs for human β1AR, human β2AR, rat β-arrestin1, rat β-arrestin2, and rat GRK2. We also thank Dr. S. L. Schmid for providing cDNAs of WT-dynamin and dominant-negative dynamin."

This enzyme is crucial in the host defense against microbial pathogens, and patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)1, who fail to assemble a functional oxidase, suffer from severe recurrent infections (3Clark R.A. Hosp. Pract. (Off. Ed.). 1990; 25 (, 59, 63–65): 51-55PubMed Google Scholar, 4Verhoeven A.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 832: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent enzyme composed of at least three cytosolic subunits, p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox, and two membrane-associated subunits, p22phox and gp91phox (1Segal A.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, the cytosolic components associate with the membrane-bound subunits, resulting in a functional oxidase complex that transfers electrons from cytosolic NADPH to extracellular oxygen (6Cross A.R. Jones O.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar,7Ellis J.A. Cross A.R. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transfer of electrons across the plasma membrane generates a massive depolarization, that, if uncompensated, would prevent further electron transfer and the associated production of superoxide (8Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar, 9Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because large amounts of acid equivalents are released in the cytosol during the hydrolysis of NADPH and its resynthesis by the hexose monophosphate shunt, the oxidase has been proposed to act as a H+ channel to preserve electroneutrality and allow the extrusion of the intracellular acid (10Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 11Henderson L.M. Chappel J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 87-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Accordingly, both the depolarization and the cytosolic acidification generated by the oxidase are potentiated by Zn2+, an inhibitor of H+channels (9Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Demaurex N. Downey G.P. Waddell T.K. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The proton channel function of gp91phox is still debated, although patch clamp studies in activated phagocytes confirmed the close coupling between H+ channels and the NADPH oxidase (9Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6885-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Activation of the NADPH oxidase induced the appearance of a new type of H+ currents in human eosinophils stimulated with GTPγS or Ca2+ (9Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The oxidase-associated H+ currents had an unusually low threshold of voltage activation, enabling the entry of H+ ions and a cytosolic acidification. In addition, the new currents activated faster, deactivated more slowly, were more sensitive to Zn2+, and were blocked by the histidine-reactive agent DEPC (9Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These unusual H+currents were not strictly coupled to electron transport, as they persisted in the presence of diphenyliodinium (DPI), an inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase, or under anoxic conditions. However, they were absent in cells from CGD patients lacking either the gp91phox or the p47 subunit (9Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), indicating that channel activation requires a functional oxidase. Similar currents were induced by PMA in neutrophils voltage-clamped using the perforated patch configuration to preserve cellular integrity. Upon PMA stimulation, the H+ current amplitude increased progressively and did not correlate with the amplitude of the electron currents but instead strongly correlated with the amplitude of resting H+ currents (13DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6885-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Block of the oxidase with DPI had no effect on the maximal H+ conductance but reversed the slowing of current deactivation, suggesting a complex interaction between oxidase activity and H+ channels. Different conclusions were drawn from these diverging, but not contradictive, observations. We concluded that phagocytes express two types of H+ channels and that gp91phox is probably the low threshold channel associated with an active oxidase (9Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast, DeCoursey et al. (13DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6885-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) concluded that PMA modulates a pre-existing H+ channel that is probably not gp91phox (13DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Zhou W. Thomas L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6885-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Consistent with gp91phox being the H+ channel itself, expression of full-length or N-truncated gp91phox generates H+ currents and pH changes in CHO cells (14Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Henderson L.M. Meech R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recently cloned NOX-1S protein, generated by alternative splicing of the NADPH oxidase homologue gene NOX-1, also catalyzes voltage-gated H+currents when expressed into HEK-293 cells (17Banfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The NOX-1S currents had a high threshold of voltage activation, unlike the H+currents observed in phagocytes with an active oxidase. Thus, gp91phox and NOX-1S are either two distinct H+ channels, or, alternatively, they both function as channel modulators. If gp91phox is indeed the H+ channel of phagocytes, its membrane expression should be sufficient to generate phagocyte-like H+ currents in non-phagocytic cells. In contrast, if gp91phox is a channel modulator, the phagocytic currents are not likely to be reproduced by the heterologous expression of gp91phox in non-phagocytic cells, which display distinct ion channels and cannot assemble a functional oxidase. In this study, we show that the stable expression of gp91phox at the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells is associated with voltage-gated H+ currents. Like all H+ currents, the gp91phox-associated currents were pH-dependent, H+-selective, and reversibly blocked by micromolar concentrations of Zn2+. However, they had faster activation kinetics than the currents observed in the same recipient cell line stably expressing the shorter oxidase homologue NOX-1S. Inhibition of heme synthesis did not affect the expression of gp91phox at the plasma membrane but dramatically modulated the H+ currents. The currents observed in heme-depleted gp91phoxcells closely resembled the H+ currents observed in phagocytes with an active oxidase. They had faster activation and slower deactivation kinetics, larger amplitude, and a much lower threshold of voltage activation that allowed H+ influx at voltages negative to H+ equilibrium potential. The currents induced by heme depletion were blocked by the histidine-reactive agent DEPC, indicating that removal of the heme moiety exposed a critical histidine residue. Replacement of the His-115 residue by leucine abolished voltage-activated currents, confirming that this residue is critical for proton conduction, as reported previously (16Henderson L.M. Meech R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33216-33223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Spectral analysis of membranes prepared from H115L cell lines revealed that the characteristic 558-nm absorbance peak of the gp91phox cytochrome was absent in the H115L mutant, indicating that His-115 is also a heme ligand. These results suggest that the gp91phoxcytochrome indeed acts as a H+ channel but that its H+ conductive properties depend on the binding of heme to the His-115 residue. Changes in heme coordination and/or spin state during the activation of the oxidase complex might thereby functionally couple electron and proton transport. The full-length human gp91phox sequence was inserted into the pSCT vector as described (18Schneider S.D. Rusconi S. Seger R.A. Hossle J.P. Gene. Ther. 1997; 4: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were transfected with the pSCT-gp91phox construct (4 µg/ml) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Stable gp91phox cell lines were generated by co-transfecting an empty pcDNA3 vector containing the neomycin resistance gene with the pSCT-gp91phox construct at 1/10 proportion. 3 days after transfection, cells were exposed to 500 µg/ml G418 for 20 days, and surviving clones were replaced in 96-well plates and cultured with 100 µg/ml G418. Individual gp91phox clones were screened for the presence of voltage-gated currents by patch clamp measurements, and clones (gp91phox–2 and gp91phox–3) that showed intermediate current densities were selected for further experiments. For site-directed mutagenesis, the gp91phox cDNA was extracted from the pSCT vector by BamHI digestion and inserted into pcDNA3. The H115L mutant was synthesized with the QuickChangeTM kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, Bâle, Switzerland), using forward primer 5′-CTT CAC TCT GCG ATT CTG ACC ATT GCA CAT C-3′ and reverse primer 5′-G ATG TGC AAT GGT CAG ATT CGC AGA GTG AAG-3′. Stable H115L cells were generated by transfecting HEK-293 cells with 1.06 µg/ml H115L-gp91phox using the TransFastTM reagent (Promega, Wadisellen, Switzerland). After selection with neomycin, individual clones were screened for the presence of the gp91phox protein by immunofluorescence and Western blot with the mAb48 antibody. A clone (B4) was selected as it showed a constant expression with both techniques. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 200 nml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2. For patch clamp measurements cells were plated on 25-mm glass coverslips 2 days before experiments. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed as described previously (9Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) in the voltage clamp mode. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass with a P-87 Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA). Pipette resistance ranged between 3 and 7 megohms, seal resistance between 2 and 20 gigaohms, and the mean access resistance varied between 10 and 30 megohms. Cell capacitance averaged 16.83 ± 0.6 picofarads (n = 111). Cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of −60 mV and depolarized to various test potentials as indicated. The currents were filtered at 1 KHz and sampled at 200 Hz using pClamp 6.0 software. Leak currents were small compared with the whole cell H+ currents and were subtracted only to allow calculation of the whole cell conductance. All recordings were performed >3 min after achieving the whole cell configuration to allow the equilibration of the cytosol with the pipette solution. Unless otherwise indicated, the bath solution contained (in mm): CsAsp 75, HEPES 100, CsOH 50, MgCl21, EGTA 0.2, pH 7.5. Pipette solutions contained, for pH 5.7, CsAsp 90, MES 100, CsOH 20; for pH 6.3, CsAsp 35, PIPES 100, CsOH 132; for pH 7.3, CsAsp 75, HEPES 100, CsOH 50; and for pH 8.0, CsAsp 77.5, Tris 100, aspartic acid 44.2. All pipettes solutions contained, in addition, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 2 mm ATP. For ion substitution experiments CsAsp was replaced by NMG-Asp or CsCl. All chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma or Fluka. DEPC was dissolved in 50% ethanol at 1.2m and used at a final concentration of 1.2 mm, such that the final ethanol concentration did not exceed 0.1%. Data analysis was performed using Origin software (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). For exponential fits, the first 5 ms of the activating or deactivating (tail) currents were not considered to avoid capacitance artifacts. Computation required ∼20–200 iterations to reach a stable condition with a level of confidence of 1%, as assessed by the nonlinear least squares regression method. The gp91phox antibodies used were as follows: a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against amino acid 562–569 of the C-terminal domain (kindly provided by Dr. F. Morel, Grenoble, France; see Figs. 1 and 4), the c-terminal mAb48 monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Dirk Roos, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; see Fig. 6), and the 7D5 monoclonal antibody directed against an external epitope of gp91phox (kindly provided by Dr. K.

Cells were then exposed to the rabbit peptide antibody (1/800), mAb48 (1/600), or mAb7D5 (1/800) for 1 h on a shaker in 0.2% Tween and 1% BSA. After three successive washes, unspecific labeling was blocked with 10% non-immune goat serum in PBS for 10 min. Cells were then immediately exposed to a Texas Red secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse (1/800), or goat anti-rabbit (1/600) for 1 h in 0.2% Tween and 1% BSA PBS. Cells were then washed two times in 0.2% Tween and 1% BSA PBS and two times in PBS and finally mounted on glass. Fluorescence images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (see Fig. 4) or with a cooled CCD camera mounted on an inverted Zeiss Axiovert S100 TV microscope (see Figs. 1 and 6). Total cellular membranes were prepared from stable gp91phox clones, control HEK-293 cells, and human neutrophils as described (19Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher B.G. Meerhof L.J. van Zwieten R. Keijer J. Weening R.S. Roos D. Blood. 1989; 73: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 108 cells/ml in PBS + 2 mm EGTA were incubated for 20 min at 0 °C under gentle agitation in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm HEPES, 3.5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, and 2 tablets of CompleteTMprotease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were then centrifuged at 12000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulted supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration measured by the Bradford method. Absorbance spectra of the membrane preparations were recorded between 400 and 600 nm on a Bio-Tek spectrometer (Kontron) before (oxidized) and after (reduced) addition of a few grains of sodium dithionite. The differential spectra were obtained by subtracting the oxidized from the reduced measurement. 20 µg of membrane proteins solubilized in sample buffer (0.187 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 7% SDS, 0.03% bromphenol blue) were loaded on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel (4% stacking gel) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in semi-dry conditions at 200 milliamperes for 45 min at room temperature using Trans-blot SD (Bio-Rad). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was reversibly stained with red ponceau and incubated for 1 h in 0.1% Tween Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with 5% milk. The membrane was then exposed overnight at 4 °C to the mAb48 (1/1000) in 0.1% Tween TBS plus 5% milk, washed three times for 5 min in 0.1% Tween TBS, and exposed to a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1/20000; Bd Transduction Laboratories, Basel, Switzerland). The blot was revealed with enhanced chemiluminescence reactifs (LumiGlo reagent and Peroxide reagent; BioConcept, Cell Signaling Switzerland, Luzern, Switzerland) and images taken with the luminescent image analyzer LAS-1000 plus (Fujifilm) using Aida 2.3 acquisition software. To investigate whether gp91phox functions as a proton channel, the membrane cytochrome was expressed in HEK-293 cells, the cell line used previously to characterize the H+ currents generated by the oxidase homologue NOX-1S (17Banfi B.

Cells were stably transfected with the cDNA coding for the full-length gp91phox cytochrome (18Schneider S.D. Rusconi S. Seger R.A. Hossle J.P. Gene. Ther. 1997; 4: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and expression of the protein was assessed by immunofluorescence using a polyclonal antibody directed against a C-terminal gp91phox epitope (20Batot G. Paclet M.H. Doussiere J. Vergnaud S. Martel C. Vignais P.V. Morel F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 188-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, a bright fluorescence staining was observed in gp91phoxtransfectants, whereas no fluorescence was observed in non-transfected cells. The staining pattern was consistent with a predominant plasma membrane localization of the epitope in the gp91phox cell line, as reported previously in CHO cells expressing full-length or truncated gp91phox (16Henderson L.M. Meech R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33216-33223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A strong fluorescence signal was also observed in non-permeabilized cells stained with the 7D5 monoclonal antibody, directed against an extracellular loop of gp91phox, demonstrating that the protein is delivered to the plasma membrane and inserted in the correct orientation (data not shown). This indicates that the gp91phox cytochrome can be expressed in non-phagocytic cells and remains properly targeted to the plasma membrane. The presence of H+ currents was then assessed with the whole cell patch clamp technique, using acidic pipette solutions to impose an outward pH gradient across the plasma membrane (100 mm MES, pHi-5.7, pHo-7.5). Cells were allowed to equilibrate for 3 min with the pipette solution to ensure a good pH clamp before recording the membrane currents. As shown in Fig. 1 A, slowly activating outward currents were observed at voltages >−40 mV in the gp91phox cell line, whereas small background currents were observed in non-transfected HEK-293 cells or in cells transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector. The background HEK-293 currents were shown previously to be unaffected by the expression of other channel proteins (17Banfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and were only observed at very acidic pipette solutions. To ensure that gp91phox did not up-regulate these endogenous HEK-293 currents, we expressed the protein in COS-7 cells, which were found to be devoid of background currents (Fig.1 A, bottom). The transient expression of gp91phox induced even larger currents in COS-7 cells, suggesting that gp91phox indeed acts as a voltage-gated channel. The current densities, however, were much more variable in the transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig.1 B, bottom panel), and the HEK-293 cell line was used to characterize the currents associated with the expression of the gp91phox protein. Voltage-gated proton channels are extremely H+-selective, strongly modulated by the pH gradient, and reversibly inhibited by polyvalent metal cations (22DeCoursey T.E. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: d477-d482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the selectivity of the gp91phox currents, we measured the reversal potential of the tail currents, Erev. Outward currents were activated by depolarizing cells to 60mV for 2 s, and deactivating tail currents were recorded during repolarization to voltages ranging from −100 to 0 mV. Fig.2 shows superimposed tail currents recorded at pHi:pHo, 5.7:7.5 in symmetric CsAsp solutions (inset). An exponential fit to the tail currents was performed to extract the instantaneous current/voltage relationship and calculate the reversal potential, which averaged −72 ± 3 mV in these conditions (n= 15). This negative reversal potential indicates that the current is unlikely to be carried by Cs or Asp, whose equilibrium potential is close to zero, but rather by H+, whose equilibrium potential is −105 mV. Accordingly, Erev was not affected by the replacement of Cs+ by NMG+ or of Asp− by Cl− but changed to −44.6 ± 2.4 (n = 9) and to −7.3 ± 5.9 mV (n= 6) when the pH value of the pipette was changed to 6.3 and 7.3, respectively (Fig. 2 A). This corresponds to a change of 42 mV per pH unit, whereas the Nernst equation predicts a shift of 58 mV. This deviation most likely reflects the imperfect intracellular pH clamp and the increased H+ depletion occurring at acidic pipette pH, as consistently reported in previous H+ channel studies (9Banfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. Demaurex N. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Biophys.

(Lond.). 1993; 466: 329-344Google Scholar). However, even assuming that the deviation is because of a finite permeability of the conductance to other ions, the relative H+ permeability pH/pCs calculated according to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation is >106 given the very low concentration of H+ compared with the other ions. Thus, the gp91phox currents are very selective for H+. Consistent with the known pH dependence of H+ channels, increasing the pH gradient by perfusing cells with more acidic pipettes increased the amplitude of the gp91phox current and shifted its threshold of voltage dependence to more negative voltages (Fig.2 B). Decreasing the pH gradient had the opposite effect, the threshold for voltage activation remaining above the H+equilibrium potential, and only outward currents were observed in all conditions (Fig. 2 B). As expected, addition of the divalent metal cation Zn2+ (3 mm free [Zn2+] calculated to be ∼20"

From the amino-terminal amino acid sequence, amino acid composition, and immunoblot analysis, we identified the active factor in platelet secretion products as sAPP, an α-secretase cleavage product of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), that contains a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain. We showed that both sAPP751 (also called Nexin II) and sAPP695, which does not contain a KPI domain, are ligands for the class A scavenger receptor (SR-A). Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected to express the SR-A bound and internalized 4-fold more human platelet-derived sAPP than control cells. The binding and internalization of sAPP were inhibited by the SR-A antagonist fucoidin. In addition, sAPP competed as effectively as fucoidin for SR-A-mediated cell association and degradation of 125I-AcLDL. To determine if the KPI domain is required for the binding of sAPP to the SR-A, APP751 and APP695 were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and sAPP751 and sAPP695 purified from the medium were tested for their binding to the SR-A. sAPP751 and sAPP695 were equally effective in competing for the cell association of 125I-AcLDL by SR-A-expressing cells, demonstrating that the KPI domain is not essential for binding. We also found that sAPP751 is present in extracts of atherosclerotic lesions and that sAPP competes for the SR-A-mediated cell association of oxidized low density lipoprotein. Deletion mutagenesis indicated that a negatively charged region of APP (residues 191–264) contributes to binding to the SR-A. These results suggest that the SR-A contributes to the clearance of sAPP and that sAPP competes for the cell association of other SR-A ligands.

These lipid-laden lesions consist primarily of macrophage foam cells containing large amounts of cholesterol ester, much of it derived from plasma lipoproteins. The accumulation of lipids in macrophages is thought to reflect uptake of modified lipoproteins by scavenger receptors. Plasma lipoproteins retained by proteoglycans in the subendothelial space of the arterial wall are thought to be modified, initially through lipid peroxidation and then by interaction of the reactive aldehydes that are formed with lysine residues of the apolipoproteins (for a review, see Ref. 1Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modified low density lipoproteins (LDL),1 which have an increased negative charge, are recognized by cell-surface receptors expressed by macrophages and are internalized, leading to foam cell formation (1Williams K.J.

They bind a wide variety of polyanions, including certain chemically modified proteins and lipoproteins such as acetyl-LDL (AcLDL) and oxidized LDL (OxLDL), polysaccharides such as fucoidin and dextran sulfate, and polyribonucleotides such as poly(I) and poly(G). All ligands for the SR-A are polyanions, but not all polyanions are ligands for the SR-A. Eliminating SR-A expression in mice significantly reduces the uptake of modified LDL by peritoneal macrophages from these animals and inhibits atherogenesis (9Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M.

We have shown that secretion products from thrombin-activated human platelets contain a factor that competes for the binding, internalization, and degradation of AcLDL by mouse peritoneal macrophages (12Phillips D.R.

At physiologic concentrations, secretion products from activated platelets inhibited the binding of AcLDL and the ability of AcLDL to induce cholesterol ester formation in these cells. We subsequently purified this protein to homogeneity and produced an antibody to it that abolished the ability of the platelet secretion products to inhibit the binding of AcLDL to macrophages. The purified secretion product bound directly to macrophages and was named platelet-derived macrophage-binding proteoglycan (PDMBP) (13Mas-Oliva J. Arnold K.S. Wagner W.D. Phillips D.R. Pitas R.E.

PDMBP inhibited the binding of AcLDL to macrophages but not to aortic endothelial cells, suggesting that PDMBP interacts with a specific receptor on macrophages. However, the sequence of PDMBP and the receptor it interacts with were not determined.

In the current study, we discovered that PDMBP is sAPP/Nexin II, that both Nexin II and sAPP695 bind to the SR-A, that sAPP competes for the binding of oxidized LDL to the SR-A, and that it is present in atherosclerotic lesions, where it might compete for the binding of atherogenic scavenger receptor ligands.

Briefly, platelets were activated with thrombin, and the secreted products were subjected to ion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sephacel) and gel-filtration chromatography (Sephacryl S-300). PDMBP/sAPP was labeled with 125I to specific activities of 250–400 cpm/ng with IODO-BEADS (Pierce, Rockford, IL), as recommended by the manufacturer. To determine if the KPI domain was important for binding to the SR-A, sAPP751 and sAPP695 were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CHO cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 containing the cDNA for human APP695 or APP751, using LipofectAMINE as recommended by the manufacturer. sAPP695 and sAPP751 were partially purified from conditioned media of the transfected cells by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography as described for the isolation of PDMBP from platelets (13Mas-Oliva J.

Several colonies for each of the deletion mutants and wild-type APP695 were analyzed for APP expression by immunoblotting with antibody 22C11 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). APP-expressing colonies were grown in 1-liter cultures, and sAPP was purified from the growth medium by Q-Sepharose and phenyl-Superose chromatography as described (29Henry A. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cappai R. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the same solution containing the primary antibody. The membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The immunoblots were visualized with the chemiluminescent reagent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. For amino-terminal sequence analysis, ∼150 pmol of PDMBP purified from platelet secretory products was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue and destained with 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid, and the band corresponding to PDMBP (∼120 kDa) was submitted to the Biomolecular Resource Center (University of California, San Francisco, CA) for amino-terminal sequence analysis. Total amino acid composition was determined at the Beckman Center (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA), on PDMBP prepared in a similar manner. Human LDL (d = 1.02–1.05 g/ml) were isolated from the plasma of normal fasting donors by sequential density ultracentrifugation at 4 °C (30Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5454-5460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL were radiolabeled by the iodine monochloride method (31Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 150–350 cpm/ng protein. LDL were acetylated with acetic anhydride (32Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). LDL were oxidized by incubation for 18 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 10 µm Cu(SO)4. Lipoproteins were dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl and 0.01% EDTA, pH 7.2, before use. Control CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 (50/50, v/v) medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. CHO cells stably transfected to express the type I SR-A were grown in the same medium containing 400 µg/ml G418. The preparation and properties of these cells have been described (33Dejager S. Mietus-Snyder M. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To examine the cell association and degradation of sAPP751, the cells were washed twice in serum-free medium and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 125I-sAPP751 (1 µg/ml). Cell-associated radioactivity (i.e. bound and internalized lipoprotein) and trichloroacetic acid-soluble lipoprotein degradation products in the medium were quantitated as described (34Arnold K.S.

Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 125I-AcLDL (2 µg/ml) alone or with the indicated concentrations of competitors. New Zealand White rabbits were fed a diet containing 0.5% cholesterol for 8 weeks. The rabbits were anesthetized and perfused with saline to clear the tissues of blood, and the aorta was removed. Raised white atherosclerotic lesions were peeled from the luminal surface of the vessel. The media under the lesion and tissue from grossly normal aorta were also collected. The samples were homogenized at 4 °C with a Polytron in buffer containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the proteins in the supernatant were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. To characterize PDMBP, we isolated it from human platelet secretion products as described (see “Experimental Procedures”) and determined that the sequence of the amino-terminal 20 amino acids of the purified PDMBP was LEVPTDGNAGLLAEPQIAMF, which exactly corresponds to the amino-terminal sequence of sAPP after removal of the signal peptide (23Oltersdorf T.

Detailed structural studies of integrins have been consistently hampered for several reasons, including the small amounts of purified protein available, the large size and conformational flexibility of integrins, and the presence of transmembrane domains andN-linked glycosylation sites in both receptor subunits. As a first step toward obtaining crystals of an integrin receptor, we have expressed a minimized dimer.

Several lines of evidence indicate that integrins also contribute to the progression of a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory, thrombotic, and neoplastic conditions (2Henderson W.R. Chi E.Y. Albert R.K. Chu S.-J. Lamm W.J.E. Rochon Y. Jonas M. Christie P.E. Harlan J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3083-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3Wang A.Z. Wang J.C.

The rational design of integrin antagonists based on ligand peptide motifs such as RGD and LDV is currently well advanced. Although the tertiary structure of the integrin heterodimer is unknown, this information would aid the process of drug development, and it represents one of the most important outstanding questions in the field.The overall shape and dimensions of the αIIbβ3 and α5β1 integrin heterodimers have been revealed by rotary shadowing electron microscopy (5Carrell N.A.

Both receptors consisted of an N-terminal globular head of 8–12 nm with two extended tails of 18–20 nm that corresponded to the C termini (7Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a soluble αIIbβ3 integrin, generated by removal of the αIIb and β3 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and the β3 cysteine-rich repeats also contained a globular head, but its tails were 4–6 nm shorter (8Wippler J.

Whereas the α- and β-subunits are unrelated in primary sequence, they share common structural features including an N-terminal globular ligand-binding domain, C-terminal stalk regions, transmembrane domains, and short cytoplasmic domains (17Loftus J.C.

The N-terminal portion of α-subunits contains seven homologous repeats, each 60–70 amino acid residues in length. These repeats are quite similar in sequence, and repeat four in some integrins and repeats five to seven in all receptors contain EF-hand-like divalent cation-binding motifs. The seven repeats have been predicted to fold cooperatively, forming an all-β structure known as a β-propeller fold (9Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). One-third of α-subunits contain a von Willebrand factor A-domain of about 200 amino acid residues in length inserted between repeats two and three. In all integrins examined to date, this domain contains the major elements involved in ligand binding. The tertiary structures of several αA-domains have been solved by x-ray crystallography and shown to adopt a Rossmann fold (16Takada Y. Kamata T. Irie A. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Zhang X.-P.

Analysis of the cell binding function of fibronectin has identified a central cell-binding domain composed of catenated modules known as type III repeats. An RGD peptide motif contained in the 10th type III repeat has been shown to be the major binding site for α5β1 (35Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar,36Yamada K.M. Kennedy D.W. J.

The fibronectin crystal structure has shown that both the RGD motif and the synergy region are on the same face of the fibronectin molecule (40Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As both integrin subunits contribute to ligand binding, the fibronectin structure imposes constraints on the tertiary structure of the integrin heterodimer; specifically the α- and β-subunits are likely to be arranged side-by-side in order to form the ligand-binding pocket (Fig. 1 (19Humphries M.J.

Therefore, the C terminus of the α5-subunit (which lies outside of the N-terminal repeats and prior to the transmembrane region; Fig. 1) does not directly contribute to ligand binding although it may contain regulatory elements (27Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15138-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Analogously, the β3- and β2-subunit C termini have been shown to be unnecessary for ligand binding, since removal of these domains by truncation followed by co-expression with the relevant full-length α-subunit generated functional integrins (8Wippler J.

Interestingly, both of these β-subunit truncations maintained conserved cysteine residues and thereby retained a disulfide knot between the N terminus and mid-section of the β-subunit, which was proposed to aid structural integrity (52Calvete J.J.

More recently soluble integrins have been produced as fusions in which the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were replaced with sequences to aid heterodimerization (60Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W.

The Fc domain was utilized to drive heterodimer formation, and the CH3 domains were modified to contain specific mutations that enhanced this process.With the exception of Ref. 8Wippler J. Kouns W.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8754-8761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, all previous soluble integrins have represented the entire ectodomains of each subunit. The apparent lack of success in generating soluble truncated α-subunits may be due to poor heterodimer formation. We therefore reasoned that expression of the α5- and β1-ectodomain as a human γ1 Fc fusion would facilitate heterodimer formation in these truncated subunits. A series of integrin-Fc truncations were generated and tested for ligand- and mAb-binding properties in comparison to native α5β1, purified from human placenta. The results identify a minimal integrin that retains full ligand binding functionality.RESULTSGeneration of Recombinant Soluble α5(Glu-951)β1(Asp-708)-FcRecombinant soluble human α5β1 integrin was produced as an Fc chimera following fusion of the cDNAs encoding the ectodomains of each subunit to genomic DNA encoding the Fc of human γ1 IgG. Separate vectors encoding the ectodomains of the α5-subunit and β1-subunit fused to specially modified human γ1 Fc domains (Fig.1) were transiently expressed in CHOL761h cells. Integrin was purified using protein A affinity chromatography and analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The major product was a protein of 300 kDa corresponding to that expected for an intact integrin heterodimer maintained by disulfide bonds in the immunoglobulin hinge (Fig. 2 A). A protein of 360 kDa, expressed at a greatly reduced level, was also observed. This protein was shown to correspond to α5(E951)α5(E951)-Fc homodimer using Western blotting with subunit-specific mAbs (data not shown). Supernatant was also examined by Western blotting under reducing conditions using an anti-human Fc antibody. The results revealed a band of 180 kDa, which corresponded to the α5(E951)-Fc protein, and a band of 140 kDa, which corresponded to the β1(D708)-Fc protein (Fig. 2 b).Figure 2Characterization of purified α5β1-Fc. A, the α5β1-Fc was purified by protein A affinity chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The α5(E951)α5 (E951)-Fc homodimer and α5(E951)β1 (D708)-Fc heterodimer are marked. B, the α5β1-Fc integrin was resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, prior to transfer to nitrocellulose and Western blotting analysis. The α5β1-Fc fusion was detected using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-human γ1 Fc antibody (0.5 μg/ml). The α5(E951)-Fc and β1(D708) proteins are marked. C, the α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc integrin was dispensed into wells of a 96-well plate pre-coated with anti-human γ1 Fc antibody. Anti-α5 (mAb16, mAb11, JBS5) and anti-β1 (12G10, TS2/16, mAb13) antibodies (1 μg/ml) were detected using appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1 μg/ml; hatched bars). Placenta-derived native human α5β1 integrin served as positive control (diluted 1:100 or ∼0.5 μg/ml; open bars). D, varying concentrations of biotinylated FnIII-(6–10) were dispensed into wells of a 96-well plate pre-coated with purified α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc, and bound ligand was detected using ExtrAvidin®-peroxidase. By non-linear regression analysis, the apparent affinity of FnIII-(6–10) binding was 2.26 ± 0.14 nm. E, varying concentrations of GRGDS or GRDGS peptide together with biotinylated FnIII-(6–10) (1 μg/ml) were dispensed into wells of a 96-well plate pre-coated with purified α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc. Bound ligand was detected using ExtrAvidin®-peroxidase. By nonlinear regression analysis the concentration of GRGDS peptide required for 50% inhibition (IC50) of FnIII-(6–10) binding was 2.22 ± 0.49 μg/ml. F, the α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc integrin was dispensed into wells of a 96-well plate pre-coated with anti-human γ1 Fc antibody (2.5 μg/ml). Varying concentrations of divalent cations or EDTA were included in the biotinylated FnIII-(6–10) (1 μg/ml) soluble phase. Bound ligand was detected using ExtrAvidin®-peroxidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of protein A-purified α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc to bind to a panel of conformation-dependent anti-α5 and anti-β1 mAbs was examined to assess whether the protein was correctly folded. A sandwich ELISA technique was employed in which the integrin-Fc fusion was captured via its Fc domain using an anti-human γ1 Fc antibody. The anti-human γ1 Fc antibody and placenta-derived human α5β1, which served as a positive control, were coated directly on to the ELISA plate. The reactivity of α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc to both anti-α5 mAbs (16, 11, JBS5) and anti-β1 mAbs (12G10, TS2/16, mAb13) was very similar to native receptor (Fig. 2 c). mAb reactivity varied depending on the mAb used; however, this was consistent with the variation seen with purified native α5β1 integrin, suggesting that α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc adopted a native fold. The anti-α5 mAb11 recognizes a linear epitope and serves as a marker for the expression of the α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc. As can be seen in Fig.2 C, the level of mAb11 binding to α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc was greater than to placenta-derived α5β1; this observation may be explained by the binding of mAb11 to the α5(E951)α5(E951)-Fc homodimer.Purified α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc was assayed for its ability to bind ligand, a recombinant fibronectin fragment containing type III repeats 6–10 (FnIII-(6–10)). Integrin-Fc fusion was directly coated onto ELISA plates, and bound FnIII-(6–10) was detected by streptavidin-HRP. The results (Fig. 2 D) showed that α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc was able to bind ligand. The apparent affinity of this interaction was calculated by non-linear regression analysis (18Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17288-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A K d value of 2.26 ± 0.14 nm was obtained, which was slightly higher than the published data for placenta-derived α5β1 (1.1 nm (18Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17288-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar)). To determine whether the integrin-fibronectin interaction was specific, competition by GRGDS peptide was tested. The results (Fig.2 e) showed that FnIII-(6–10) binding was inhibited by GRGDS, but not by GRDGS, suggesting that the interaction was indeed specific and that fibronectin binding was RGD-dependent. The IC50 value, or concentration of GRGDS required for half-maximal inhibition, was calculated as 2.22 ± 0.49 μg/ml, but GRDGS peptide had little effect, even at 100 μg/ml.The divalent cation requirement for FnIII-(6–10) binding to purified α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc was assessed using a FnIII-(6–10)-binding ELISA and varying concentrations of divalent cations. The results (Fig. 2 f) demonstrated that no ligand binding was observed in the absence of divalent cations or in the presence of EDTA or Ca2+. Conversely in the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+ ligand binding was readily detectable. The degree of ligand binding was greater with Mn2+ than with Mg2+. This indicated that Mn2+ was a more efficient activator of α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc than Mg2+. Ligand binding increased with increasing concentrations of either Mn2+ or Mg2+; however, whereas ligand binding peaked with 1 mm Mn2+, it continued to increase even at 3 mm Mg2+. These data are in good agreement with the published data for placenta-derived human α5β1 (70Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), showing that α5(E951)β1(D708)-Fc interacts with FnIII-(6–10) in a divalent cation-dependent manner.Thus, the Fc system enabled the production of soluble full-length α5β1-Fc integrin. Incorporation of the Fc domains did not compromise folding of the integrin or the relative positioning of the subunits, since the ligand-binding pocket and regulatory elements involved in the divalent cation response of the integrin were intact.Truncation of the β1-SubunitTo identify the domain(s) of the β1-Fc subunit, which when co-expressed with α5(E951)-Fc, were necessary and sufficient for ligand recognition, various truncations were generated.C-terminal TruncationThe cDNA encoding the β1(D708) subunit was C-terminally truncated to β1(P455) and fused in-frame to the human γ1Fc genomic DNA. This truncation point was chosen because it lies just C-terminal to the conserved cysteine residues that form long range structural disulfide bonds and would therefore not be expected to perturb these structural features (TableI). Expression of the β1(P455)-Fc construct would yield a C-terminally truncated β1-subunit, lacking the four cysteine-rich repeats and encompassing the ligand-binding domain from Gln1 through Pro455, reminiscent of previous studies (8Wippler J.

However, the failure of TFOs to bind target sequences at physiological pH and Mg2+ concentration has limited their biological applications. Recently, pyrimidine TFOs with 2′-O-aminoethyl (AE) substitutions were shown to have enhanced kinetics and stability of triplex formation (Cuenoud, B., Casset, F., Husken, D., Natt, F., Wolf, R. M., Altmann, K. H., Martin, P., and Moser H. E. (1998) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 37, 1288–1291). We have prepared psoralen-linked TFOs with varying amounts of the AE-modified residues, and have characterized them in biochemical assays in vitro, and in stability andHPRT gene knockout assays in vivo. The AE TFOs showed higher affinity for the target in vitro than a TFO with uniform 2′-OMe substitution, with relatively little loss of affinity when the assay was performed in reduced Mg2+. Once formed they were also more stable in “physiological” buffer, with the greatest affinity and stability displayed by the TFO with all but one residue in the AE format. However, TFOs with lesser amounts of the AE modification formed the most stable triplexes in vivo, and showed the highest HPRT gene knockout activity. We conclude that the AE modification can enhance the biological activity of pyrimidine TFOs, but that extensive substitution is deleterious.

Thus the interaction of third strands and intact DNA duplexes to form stable DNA triplexes (1Felsenfeld G. Davies D.R. Rich A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 2023-2024Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar) has been of interest for many years (2Thuong N.T. Helene C. Angew. Chem. Int.

Some of the properties of these structures make triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFOs)1 attractive candidates for development as gene targeting reagents. Triplex formation, which occurs on polypurine:polypyrimidine sequences, is an inherent property of nucleic acids and has no protein or enzyme requirement (7Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 8Radhakrishnan I. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11405-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The binding of the third strand to the duplex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the bases of the third strand and the purines in the target duplex. The specific interactions can be described as a third strand binding code (9Fossella J.A. Kim Y.J. Shih H. Richards E.G. Fresco J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4511-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and are the basis for the high stringency of TFO specificity (10Beal P.A. Dervan P.B.

Triplexes can be quite stable with half-lives of many hours or days (12Maher III, L.J. Wold B. Dervan P.B. Antisense Res.

Although current oligonucleotide chemistry limits triplex formation to polypurine:polypyrimidine stretches, these elements are over-represented in the mammalian genome (16Manor H. Rao B.S. Martin R.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1988; 27: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and most genes contain appropriate target sequences. Furthermore, data from different experimental systems indicate that both extrachromosomal and chromosomal target sites in living cells are accessible to TFOs (17Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M.

A. 2000; 97: 3084-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).However, despite 40 years of research, there remain a number of impediments to the successful employment of TFOs as gene targeting reagents. Some of these obstacles reflect the properties of the oligonucleotides. Depending on the nature of the target either purine or pyrimidine TFOs can be used, but there are problems associated with each motif. Under physiological conditions purine TFOs are often subject to self-structure formation, which is incompatible with triplex formation (20Noonberg S.B. Francois J.C. Garestier T. Helene C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Cheng A.J. Wang J.C. Van Dyke M.W. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cytosine residues in pyrimidine motif TFOs must be protonated at N-3 in order for hydrogen bond formation at this position. The pK a of cytosine is 4.5, and most pyrimidine TFOs are relatively inactive at physiological pH. Furthermore, triplex formation by TFO in both motifs is often sharply dependent on Mg2+ concentration (22Blume S.W. Lebowitz J. Zacharias W. Guarcello V. Mayfield C.A. Ebbinghaus S.W. Bates P. Jones Jr., D.E. Trent J. Vigneswaran N. Miller D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Most binding studies use 5–10 mm Mg2+, which is likely to be higher than the free intracellular concentration. Obviously, if TFOs are to become effective gene targeting reagents, they, at a minimum, must be active at physiological pH and Mg2+ concentration.Some progress has been made toward overcoming these problems, particularly in the pyrimidine motif. Replacement of cytosine by 5-methylcytosine partially alleviates the pH restriction on triplex formation (23Lee J.S. Woodsworth M.L. Latimer L.J. Morgan A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6603-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 24Povsic T.J. Dervan P.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3059-3061Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Following the observation that pyrimidine triplexes with RNA third strands are more stable than the complex with the corresponding DNA third strand (25Roberts R.W. Crothers D.M.

A. 1993; 90: 3806-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it was shown that triplex stability could be enhanced when the TFOs contained 2′-O-methyl (OMe)-modified sugars (28Escude C. Sun J.S. Rougee M. Garestier T. Helene C. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1992; 315: 521-525PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dagneaux C. Liquier J. Taillandier E.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Structural studies indicate that this modification stabilizes the C3′-endo,2′-exo configuration of the sugar. This is the optimal conformation for triplex formation by pyrimidine oligonucleotides, and provokes the least perturbation of the underlying duplex (31Asensio J.L. Carr R. Brown T. Lane A.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 11063-11070Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Recently, additional sugar modifications have been described which considerably extend the stability of pyrimidine motif triplexes (32Cuenoud B. Casset F. Husken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed. 1998; 37: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Among these the 2′-O-aminoethyl (AE) substitution produced a 3.5 °C increase in thermal stability per modification, measured at pH 7.0. NMR analysis indicated that a hydrogen bond formed between the positively charged amino residue and an oxygen of the negatively charged phosphate of the purine strand of the duplex. The sugar conformation was C3′-endo,2′-exo and the underlying duplex showed only slight distortion (33Blommers M.J. Natt F. Jahnke W. Cuenoud B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17714-17725Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This substitution also conferred high nuclease resistance on the TFO (32Cuenoud B. Casset F. Husken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed. 1998; 37: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 34Griffey R.H. Monia B.P. Cummins L.L. Freier S. Greig M.J. Guinosso C.J. Lesnik E. Manalili S.M. Mohan V. Owens S. Ross B.R. Sasmor H. Wancewicz E. Weiler K. Wheeler P.D. Cook P.D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 5100-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the AE TFOs were not tested in bioassays their properties would seem consistent with activity in cell-based assays.We are developing TFOs as gene targeting reagents, and have demonstrated specific gene knockout in mammalian cells using a TFO linked to psoralen (18Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M. Seidman M.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Consequently oligonucleotide modifications that have the potential to solve some of the problems mentioned above are of considerable interest. Here we describe the preparation and characterization of psoralen-linked TFOs with different degrees of 2′-AE substitution. We have characterized these in biochemical assaysin vitro, and in stability and gene knockout assays in mammalian cells in vivo. We find that these TFOs have enhanced affinity for their target sequences in vitro, and some, but not all, are active in bioassays in vivo.DISCUSSIONGenerally, pyrimidine motif TFOs with deoxyribose sugars have been characterized by relatively weak affinity for their duplex targets at physiological pH and Mg2+ concentration (2Thuong N.T. Helene C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1993; 32: 666-690Crossref Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The pH problem has been somewhat ameliorated by the replacement of cytosine by 5-Me-cytosine (23Lee J.S. Woodsworth M.L. Latimer L.J. Morgan A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 6603-6614Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for non-physiological levels of Mg2+ still requires a satisfactory solution. The realization that RNA-like third strands (as defined by an oxygen at the 2′ position) formed more stable triplexes than the 2′-deoxy equivalents (25Roberts R.W. Crothers D.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1463-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) led to the use of the 2′-OMe substitution in pyrimidine TFOS (28Escude C. Sun J.S. Rougee M. Garestier T. Helene C. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1992; 315: 521-525PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dagneaux C. Liquier J. Taillandier E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16618-16623Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Shimizu M. Konishi A. Shimada Y. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although TFOs with this modification clearly show improvement in conventional assays in vitro, we found that the binding of our PS-01 TFO was diminished in physiological Mg2+, and was essentially inactive in our knockout experiments despite the uniform presence of 2′-OMe modified sugars (18Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M. Seidman M.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (this report). Significant biological activity was observed, in our earlier study, only when an intercalator was introduced into the oligonucleotide (18Majumdar A. Khorlin A. Dyatkina N. Lin F.L. Powell J. Liu J. Fei Z. Khripine Y. Watanabe K.A. George J. Glazer P.M. Seidman M.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Those results underscored the need to extend the activity of pyrimidine TFOs containing 2′-OMe sugars, but also indicated that appropriate chemical modifications could confer biological activity. Consequently it was of considerable interest to ask if TFOs with 2′-AE sugars would show enhanced biological activity relative to their counterparts carrying only 2′-OMe sugars.It was crucial for these analyses that the TFOs with AE substitutions carry fully functional psoralen moieties. TFOs with inactive psoralen would compete with fully active molecules and thus reduce the overall efficacy of the reagents. We found that protocols used previously for deprotection of AE oligonucleotides gave heterogeneous products and appreciable loss of psoralen activity. We eventually determined that gas phase deprotection with anhydrous methylamine produced a largely homogeneous product with excellent psoralen activity (44Boal J.H. Wilk A. Harindranath N. Max E.E. Kempe T. Beaucage S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3115-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). While methylamine is a stronger base than the ammonia used in conventional procedures, the deprotection reactions were performed at room temperature, which reduced the probability of hydrolysis of the psoralen lactone ring.TFO DesignThe Pso TFOs described here contained 2′-AE sugars in three different formats. AE-01 was uniformly substituted save for the 3′ residue (for synthetic reasons). This TFO was analogous to the fully modified 15-mer characterized in the earlier study by Cuenoudet al. (32Cuenoud B. Casset F. Husken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed. 1998; 37: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). That TFO displayed a dramatic enhancement of target affinity and stability of the resultant triplex. AE-02 contained 6 contiguous 2′-AE residues at the 3′ end and was designed with the expectation that this organization would confer enhanced binding as well as resistance to 3′-exonuclease activity (48Teplova M. Wallace S.T. Tereshko V. Minasov G. Symons A.M. Cook P.D. Manoharan M. Egli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14240-14245Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The AE-03 TFO retained the motif of a 3′ patch of AE combined with a 5′ patch. Based on the previous work (32Cuenoud B. Casset F. Husken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed. 1998; 37: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) we anticipated that the AE TFOs would have greater affinity for their targets than the 2′-OMe equivalent and this was substantiated in the in vitro experiments (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the 2′-AE modification appeared to reduce the requirement for Mg2+ for triplex formation, which characterized the TFO with only the 2′-OMe substitution. In addition, the AE TFOs formed triplexes that were very stable in physiological buffer at 37 °C. Remarkably stable purine motif triplexes have been described (14Svinarchuk F. Monnot M. Merle A. Malvy C. Fermandjian S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3831-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Svinarchuk F. Paoletti J. Malvy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14068-14071Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the triplexes formed by the AE TFOs appear to be comparably stable. The results of these biochemical analyses suggested that, while the AE TFOs as a group were clearly superior to PS-01, there was little to distinguish one from the other, and we expected them to display similar activity in the biological assays.TFO BioactivityWe tested the TFOs in two bioassays, one that measured triplex stability, the other gene targeting activity. The plasmid based stability assay measures the persistence of a preformed triplex in the nuclear compartment that supports plasmid replication and mutagenesis of the TFO-psoralen cross-link. The triplex is exposed to the ionic environment as well as to the proteins and enzymes of this compartment. In our earlier study we found that triplex stability could be extended by lowering the temperature of the cells prior to photoactivation (36Lin F.L. Majumdar A. Klotz L.C. Reszka A.P. Neidle S. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39117-39124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and we suggested that temperature-sensitive factors could destabilize triplexes in vivo. These might include helicases (49Brosh Jr., R.M. Majumdar A. Desai S. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. Seidman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3024-3030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the enzymology of RNA and DNA synthesis, chromatin assembly and modulation factors, and the proteins and enzymes involved in DNA repair (50Wang G. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This is speculative and it is clear that we lack an understanding of the ionic and protein effectors of triplex stability in the nucleus. However, two conclusions can be drawn from our experiments. The first is that it is possible to extend triplex stability in this compartment by modification of the TFO, as demonstrated by AE-02 and AE-03. This is encouraging because it suggests that, whatever the nature of the destabilizing factors, they can be countered, at least partially, by changes in the oligonucleotide chemistry. The second, somewhat unexpected given the data in Fig. 4, was that too much of the AE modification was deleterious (see below).The results of the knockout assay showed that TFOs AE-02 and AE-03 were active, unlike PS-01. The PS-01 TFO had the weakest affinity for the target sequence in 10 mm Mg2+ concentration, and showed a marked decline in activity when the Mg2+ was reduced to 1 mm. In contrast, TFOs with 2′-AE substitutions formed triplexes at low concentrations (this report), or even in the absence, of Mg2+ (32Cuenoud B. Casset F. Husken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed. 1998; 37: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 33Blommers M.J. Natt F. Jahnke W. Cuenoud B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17714-17725Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that a TFO must be effective at low concentrations of Mg2+ if it is to be active in vivo (51Lacroix L. Arimondo P.B. Takasugi M. Helene C. Mergny J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus among the explanations for the activity differences between PS-01 and AE-02 and AE-03, it is likely that triplex formation in low Mg2+ is an key distinction. The importance of Mg2+ for triplex formation by conventional oligonucleotides is well established (22Blume S.W. Lebowitz J. Zacharias W. Guarcello V. Mayfield C.A. Ebbinghaus S.W. Bates P. Jones Jr., D.E. Trent J. Vigneswaran N. Miller D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the contribution of oligonucleotide modifications to improved TFO activity in reduced Mg2+ has been emphasized in recent publications (51Lacroix L. Arimondo P.B. Takasugi M. Helene C. Mergny J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 52Lacroix L. Lacoste J. Reddoch J.F. Mergny J.L. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Matteucci M.D. Glazer P.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1893-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). TFOs with a phosphoramidate backbone have been extensively characterized and shown to form very stable triplexes in 10 mm Mg2+. However, in contrast to the AE TFOs, triplex formation in the absence of Mg2+ was diminished (51Lacroix L. Arimondo P.B. Takasugi M. Helene C. Mergny J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and these TFOs appear to show only modest bioactivity (19Barre F.X. Ait-Si-Ali S. Giovannangeli C. Luis R. Robin P. Pritchard L.L. Helene C. Harel-Bellan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3084-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).The activity in vitro, in low levels of Mg2+, does not explain the striking biological failure of the AE-01 TFO, which was almost completely substituted with 2′-AE sugars. This TFO is an analogue of one described previously, which bound its target in the absence of Mg2+ (32Cuenoud B. Casset F. Husken D. Natt F. Wolf R.M. Altmann K.H. Martin P. Moser H.E. Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed. 1998; 37: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although AE-01 had the greatest affinity, and formed very stable triplexes in vitro, it performed poorly in both assays of activity in vivo. We suggest that there are at least two explanations. The first is based on our observations of this oligonucleotide during the preparation and purification. We had difficulty recovering material and found that it was adherent to glass, columns etc. Apparently the extensive aminoethoxy substitution altered the properties of the molecule and we think it likely that the oligonucleotide may have been bound by cellular membranes, proteins, nonspecifically to DNA, etc., greatly reducing the effective TFO concentration in the nucleus.In the case of the stability assay in vivo, the triplexes were preformed and would have been carried into the nucleus by the transfection of the plasmid. If the action of cellular proteins and enzymes underlies triplex instability then, apparently, the AE-01 triplex was a better substrate for these activities than the triplexes formed by the other TFOs. The 2′-AE modification makes two contributions to the biochemistry of a TFO. In addition to the interaction between the amine and an oxygen in the purine strand of the duplex, this modification also preorganizes the C3′-endo,2′-exo conformation of the sugar (33Blommers M.J. Natt F. Jahnke W. Cuenoud B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17714-17725Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This structure has been shown to be preferred in pyrimidine triplexes (31Asensio J.L. Carr R. Brown T. Lane A.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 11063-11070Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In studies with oligonucleotides containing sugars locked in this conformation it has been shown that the local conformation of a single locked sugar can influence the conformation of unmodified sugars in the adjacent four nucleotides (53Pradeepkumar P.I. Zamaratski E. Foldesi A. Chattopadhyaya J. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 8601-8607Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). If this is also true for the AE sugars then the combination of the conformational influence on the immediate and adjacent residues may produce a TFO that is perhaps too constrained, unable to make subtle structural adjustments that may be required for triplex stability in vivo. Whatever the actual reason(s) for the poor activity of the AE-01 TFO our data do indicate that extensive modification is not productive. It will be of interest to determine if the extent of other sugar analogues that improve TFO binding in vitro (51Lacroix L. Arimondo P.B. Takasugi M. Helene C. Mergny J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 54Torigoe H. Hari Y. Sekiguchi M. Obika S. Imanishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2354-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) must also be limited in TFOs intended for biological applications.The end point of the HPRT knockout assay is a mutation frequency. This reflects a summation of events, most with negative effect, that influence the probability of a targeted mutation inHPRT. The frequency can be no greater than the number of cells with triplexes in place at the time of photoactivation of the psoralen. This will be a function of the TFO transfection efficiency, the intrinsic accessibility of the target sequence at the time of TFO entry, and the frequency and stability of triplexes that form on accessible targets. It is likely that many binding events are unregistered because they fail to persist to the time of UVA treatment. Following photoactivation the oligonucleotide-psoralen cross-link can be a substrate for the machinery of DNA repair, whose action may have no mutational consequences. Thus the mutation frequency is an underestimate, perhaps considerable, of the binding activity of a TFOin vivo. We expect that the development of efficient and robust gene knockout protocols will involve manipulation of the cell biology to enhance target accessibility and mutagenic processing of the targeted DNA damage. In addition, we believe that further optimization of the AE format TFOs, perhaps in combination with other sugar and base modifications (54Torigoe H. Hari Y. Sekiguchi M. Obika S. Imanishi T. J.

Reagents that recognize and bind specific genomic sequences in mammalian cells would have broad application for promoter suppression, gene knockout, target validation, and as probes of chromosome structure. Thus the interaction of third strands and intact DNA duplexes to form stable DNA triplexes (1Felsenfeld G. Davies D.R. Rich A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 2023-2024Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar) has been of interest for many years (2Thuong N.T. Helene C. Angew. Chem. Int.

Anti-cancer Drug Des. 1997; 12: 433-442PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the properties of these structures make triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFOs)1 attractive candidates for development as gene targeting reagents. Triplex formation, which occurs on polypurine:polypyrimidine sequences, is an inherent property of nucleic acids and has no protein or enzyme requirement (7Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 8Radhakrishnan I. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11405-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The binding of the third strand to the duplex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the bases of the third strand and the purines in the target duplex. The specific interactions can be described as a third strand binding code (9Fossella J.A. Kim Y.J. Shih H. Richards E.G. Fresco J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4511-4515Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and are the basis for the high stringency of TFO specificity (10Beal P.A. Dervan P.B.

It is presumed that these proteins couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate transport, yet ATPase activity has been demonstrated for only a few. To provide direct evidence for such activity in Ste6p, the yeast ABC protein required for the export of a-factor mating pheromone, we established conditions for purification of Ste6p in biochemical quantities from both yeast and Sf9 insect cells. The basal ATPase activity of purified and reconstituted Ste6p (V(max) = 18 nmol/mg/min; K(m) for MgATP = 0.2 mm) compares favorably with several other ABC proteins and was inhibited by orthovanadate in a profile diagnostic of ABC transporters (apparent K(I) = 12 microm). Modest stimulation (approximately 40%) was observed upon the addition of a-factor either synthetic or in native form. We also used an 8-azido-[alpha-(32)P]ATP binding and vanadate-trapping assay to examine the behavior of wild-type Ste6p and two different double mutants (G392V/G1087V and G509D/G1193D) shown previously to be mating-deficient in vivo. Both mutants displayed a diminished ability to hydrolyze ATP, with the latter uncoupled from pheromone transport. We conclude that Ste6p catalyzes ATP hydrolysis coupled to a-factor transport, which in turn promotes mating."

Targeting of the DmsA and DmsB catalytic subunits to the membrane requires the membrane targeting and translocation (Mtt) system. The DmsAB dimer is a member of a family of extrinsic, cytoplasmic facing membrane subunits that require Mtt in order to assemble on the membrane. We show that the MttA2, MttB, and presumably MttA1 but not the MttC proteins are required for targeting DmsAB to the membrane. Unlike other Mtt substrates such as trimethylamine N-oxide reductase, the soluble cytoplasmic DmsAB dimer that accumulates in the mttdeletions is very labile. Deletion of the mttA2or mttB genes also prevents anaerobic growth on fumarate even though fumarate reductase does not require Mtt for assembly. This was due to the lethality of membrane insertion of DmsC in the absence of the DmsAB subunits. In the absence of DmsC, DmsAB accumulates in the cytoplasm. A 45-amino acid leader on DmsA is removed during assembly. Processing does not require DmsC but does require Mtt. Translocation of DmsAB to the periplasm is not required for processing. The leader may be cleaved by a novel leader peptidase, or the long DmsA leader may traverse the membrane through the Mtt system resulting in cleavage by the periplasmic leader peptidase I followed by release of DmsA into the cytoplasm.

Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation of proteins by thesec pathway requires the protein to remain in an open conformation during the process of translocation and extensive information exits for sec-mediated translocation (2Settles A.M.

The Mtt system is comprised of at least three proteins, MttA1A2B (also called TatABC) and has been shown to transport fully folded proteins to or across the membrane (8Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T.

Quentin Y. Fichant G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 179-189PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of the Mtt system explained the translocation into the periplasm of cofactor-containing proteins that were assembled in the cytoplasmic compartment. These proteins have a long N-terminal leader with a conserved twin arginine motif ((S/T)RRXF(X/L)K) (11Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). They have diversity in subunit composition, molecular weight, the nature of the redox cofactors, and cellular localization (13Wu L.F. Ize B. Chanal A. Quentin Y. Fichant G. J. Mol. Microbiol.

Bacterial proteins utilizing the Mtt pathway include some proteins without cofactors such as SufI, a member of the copper oxidase family, fusion proteins containing a reporter gene (e.g.β-lactamase), and even malfolded proteins (9Sargent F.

Components of the Mtt protein translocation machinery are found in at least half of the complete bacterial genomes available to date as well as the genomes of chloroplasts and plant mitochondria. However, Mtt is totally absent from animal genomes (8Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Turner R.J.

Chanal A. Quentin Y. Fichant G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 179-189PubMed Google Scholar). Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) reductase is encoded by thedms operon and is expressed under anaerobic growth conditions in the absence of nitrate (20Bilous P.T. Cole S.T. Anderson W.F. Weiner J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Bilous P.T. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive investigation has shown that the DmsAB subunits form a membrane extrinsic dimer facing the cytoplasm, and DmsC, an integral membrane protein, serves as a membrane anchor (22Sambasivarao D. Scraba D.G. Trieber C. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5938-5948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have confirmed that DmsA has an N-terminal twin arginine leader that functions as a membrane-targeting signal and is also essential for the stability of the holoenzyme (15Sambasivarao D. Turner R.J. Simala-Grant J.L. Shaw G. Hu J. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22526-22531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Membrane targeting via the Mtt system is not limited to Me2SO reductase. Formate dehydrogenase-O is targeted to the membrane (but not translocated across) by a twin arginine leader (23Benoit S. Abaibou H. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6625-6634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, chlorophenol reductive dehalogenase (encoded bycprAB genes) of Desulfitobacterium dehalogenase was shown to be a membrane-bound enzyme, apparently targeted to the membrane by the twin arginine leader. CprA undergoes processing resulting in cleavage of the leader, and the mature form of the enzyme was localized to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane with the CprB subunit presumably serving a membrane anchor function (24van de Pas B.A. Smidt H.

Thus certain membrane-bound enzymes whose active sites face the cytoplasm appear to be targeted to the membrane by the Mtt system (15Sambasivarao D. Turner R.J. Simala-Grant J.L. Shaw G. Hu J.

To better understand the mechanism of the membrane targeting of Me2SO reductase, we have constructed several mutant strains defective in the mtt genes. We provide experimental evidence to show that Mtt catalyzes the targeting of DmsAB to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, but not its translocation, and that a functional Mtt system is required for processing of DmsA to the mature form and for the stability of the DmsAB dimer. Molecular biology reagents and ECL Western blotting detection kit were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Oligonucleotides were obtained from the Department of Biochemistry DNA core facility, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. DNA polymerases (Taq and Elongase enzyme mix) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Pfu DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene.

Me2SO reductase activity was monitored by the oxidation of reduced benzyl viologen by the substrate TMAO. Fumarate reductase activity was monitored in an assay system similar to the Me2SO reductase, except fumarate was used as a substrate (22Sambasivarao D. Scraba D.G. Trieber C. Weiner J.H. J.

The entire mtt operon was amplified using the oligonucleotide pairs RAT20/GZ-01 (see Table II for oligonucleotide sequences) with flanking EcoRI and SalI restriction enzyme sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR product (2544 bp) was cloned into the EcoRI andSalI sites of pMS119EH or pTZ19R to yield the plasmids pMTT(AmpR) and pMTT/19R (AmpR), respectively.

The PCR DNA (3596 bp) was digested with EcoRI and PstI enzymes, respectively, to yield 3375 bp of the mtt gene sequence. ThePstI site is present within the 3′ end of the amplified DNA, outside of the mtt operon. TheEcoRI/PstI fragment was cloned intoEcoRI/PstI-cleaved pBR322 resulting in deletion of the bulk of the ampicillin coding region of the vector to yield the plasmid pMTT-322 (TetR). This plasmid also differs from pMTT or pMTT/19R in that it has an extended 5′ region (588 bp upstream of the ATG start codon of MttA1) and 3′ sequences (356 bp) downstream of the mtt operon. Plasmid pMTTB gene was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides GZ-04/RAT22. The PCR DNA (827 bp) was cut with EcoRI and SalI prior to cloning into pMS119EH to generate the plasmid pMTTB. Plasmid pDMS193 encodes the DmsAB dimer under control of thedms promoter and was constructed using PCR with primers DS-23/DS-24 and pDMS160 as template DNA to amplify a 188-bp DNA fragment that covers the 3′ end of dmsB with an engineered stop codon and flanking SstI andSalI/XhoI restriction enzyme sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The plasmid pDMS190 was digested withSstI and SalI to remove part of 3′ end ofdmsB and the entire dmsC (1073 bp). The DNA was gel-eluted, and the larger fragment (7494 bp) containing the entiredmsA and most of dmsB was mixed with the PCR DNA and ligated to yield the plasmid, pDMS193. ThemttA2 gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis. The plasmid pMTT/19R was cut with SacII at the unique site within mttA2. The recessed ends were filled in to create blunt ends. A blunt-ended chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CmR) gene cartridge, CAT, generated using PCR (see below) was inserted at the filled in SacII site of the pMTT/19R plasmid to generate pΔMTTA2/CAT. The CmR gene sequence (CAT) was amplified using pACYC184 DNA as template and the oligonucleotides CAT5/CAT3 (Table II). The CAT cartridge has BamHI-flanking ends and was also used to generate various mtt gene deletions as summarized below and in Table II. The mtt mutant plasmids pΔMTT/CAT, pΔMTTA1/CAT, pΔMTTA2/CAT, pΔMTTB/CAT, pΔMTTC/CAT were constructed as summarized in Table II. The mutant plasmids were introduced individually into the recombination deficient strains JC7623 or D308 as described earlier (25Sambasivarao D. Weiner J.H. J.

The appropriate deletions from the rec − strains were P1 transduced into the recipient strain, TG1 to generate DSS640 (Δmtt), DSS641 (ΔmttA1), DSS642 (ΔmttA2), DSS643 (ΔmttB), and DSS644 (ΔmttC), respectively. Strains deleted in the chromosomal dms (ΔdmsABC) and themtt operons (ΔmttABC) were constructed by P1 transduction of the ΔmttABC mutation (pΔMTT/CAT), ΔmttB (pΔMTTB/CAT), or ΔmttC (pΔMTTC/CAT) into DSS301 (Δdms) resulting in strains DSS740, DSS743, and DSS744, respectively. Strain K-38/pGP1-2 was P1-transduced using the phage lysates from DSS640 carrying a mtt operon deletion to generate K-38/pGP1–2/Δmtt.

The x-ray structure of the NAD binary complex at 2.1 Å reveals two sulfate ions bound in the closed form of the active site. The sulfate that occupies the substrate binding site has been translated ∼2 Å toward the opening of the active site cavity.

The reaction is part of the citric acid cycle and, in eukaryotes, the malate/aspartate shuttle. MDH is highly selective for its 4-carbon dicarboxylic acid substrate, distinguishing malate from the readily available 3-carbon (pyruvate) and 5-carbon (α-ketoglutarate) mono- and di-carboxylic substrate analogues. Insights into the substrate binding come from the crystallographic structures of eMDH·citrate·NAD complex (1Hall M.D. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), where citrate mimics the substrate, and cytoplasmic porcine MDH (cytMDH)·α-ketomalonate·tetrahydro-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (2Chapman A.D.M. Cortes A. Dafforn T.R. Clarke A.R. Brady R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in which α-ketomalonate is a substrate analogue. Both of these substrate mimics are coordinated by three arginine residues in the active site (Fig.1). Two of these arginines, Arg-81 and Arg-87, 2For consistency all residues will be identified using the E. coli MDH numbering. 2For consistency all residues will be identified using the E. coli MDH numbering. are located on a loop that bends into the active site and form hydrogen bond interactions with the 4-carboxyl and 2-hydroxyl/ketone of the substrate. A third arginine, Arg-153, completes the coordination of the substrate by hydrogen bonding to the 1-carboxyl group of the substrate. A histidine/aspartate pair, His-177 and Asp-150, present in all 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases (3Birktoft J.J. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 472-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acts as a proton relay system during catalysis and requires correct positioning with the 2-hydroxyl group. The rather large anion pocket, which comprises the active site, can accommodate the 6-carbon moiety, citrate, and small negatively charged anions such as sulfate, suggesting that the coordination of the true substrate to target residues within the active site produces the specificity of the enzyme. MDH and LDH, both 2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenases, share similar tertiary structure and conservation of the nucleotide binding domain and catalytic residues, yet select for di- versus monocarboxylic acid substrates. 1­carboxyl4­carboxylCOO−‖HO—C—H‖CH2‖COO−COO−‖HO—C—H‖CH3MalateLactatedi­carboxylic acidmonocarboxylic acid Chapman et al. (2Chapman A.D.M. Cortes A. Dafforn T.R. Clarke A.R. Brady R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) proposed that MDH is unable to bind the monocarboxylic acids with high affinity due to the charge repulsion that would occur between the two positively charged groups, Arg-81 and Arg-87, when the active site loop bends into the anion pocket. The binding of the dicarboxylic acid substrate to MDH is far more favorable for the two positive charges present as Arg-81 and Arg-87. LDH avoids this charge imbalance with a conserved glutamine at position 81. Manipulation of MDH and LDH specificity has been directed at point mutations of position 81 to Gln and Arg, respectively. In the LDH mutant, Q81R (4Wilks H.M. Hart K.W. Feeney R. Dunn C.R. Muirhead H. Chia W.N. Barstow D.A. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Science. 1988; 242: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), substrate specificity was reversed from mono- to dicarboxylic acids. The R81Q MDH mutant exhibited no corresponding reversal of substrate specificity, only a broadened recognition of substrates with a marked reduction in overall catalytic rate. (5Nicholls D. Miller J. Scawen M. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Atkinson T. Goward C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The R81Q MDH indicated that specificity for malate/oxaloacetate could not be assigned to only one residue in the active site. Structural analysis of a point mutant to manipulate substrate specificity is the basis of the current study. Wright and Viola (6Wright S.K. Viola R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31151-31155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have mutated Arg-153 to a cysteine to disrupt the interaction with the 1-carboxyl group of malate during the catalytic reaction. Unexpectedly, the K m of the enzyme for the substrate was essentially unchanged but catalysis was dramatically altered withk cat for the interconversion of malate to oxaloacetate significantly decreased. In addition, R153C was shown to display increased capacity to utilize pyruvate as a substrate (6Wright S.K. Viola R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31151-31155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here we present crystal structures of the R153C·NAD binary complex and the R153C·NAD·pyruvate ternary complex. In addition, hypothetical energy-refined models have been determined for the interaction of the substrate with the chemical modifications that have been introduced at position Sγ of Cys-153. E. coli R153C MDH was expressed and purified as described by Hall et al. (7Hall M. Levitt D. McAlister-Henn L. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method out of a solution of 0.1 m Tris-maleate, pH 6.0, 24–30% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals appeared in 7–10 days when grown at 18 °C. They were soaked in mother liquor plus 10 µm NAD for 1 h before mounting in a glass capillary. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on an R-AXIS IV2+ Rigaku imaging plate (Molecular Structure Corp. (MSC)). The diffraction data were indexed using the CrystalClear Software (MSC) into a C2 space group, with cell dimensions ofa = 148.14 Å, b = 53.08 Å,c = 164.29 Å, and β = 95.26°. The phase information was obtained by using molecular replacement methods with AMoRe-CCP4 (an Automated package for MolecularReplacement; Ref. 8Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar), and the native eMDH coordinates (1Hall M.D. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as a probe. Four subunits (A through D) were placed in the a.s.u. Rigid body refinement was done with AMoRe-CCP4 (9Castellano E. Oliva G. Navaza J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 281-284Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NCS “strict” constraints were used on one of the two dimers in the a.s.u. Model refinement was done with CNS version 0.5 (10Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grossekunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). Initial rounds of refinement included simulated annealing, positional, and B factor refinement. The program O was used for model rebuilding after each round of refinement (11Jones T. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). When the refinement reached an R cryst of 0.25, ligands were placed in the model. The coordinates for NAD and SO 42− were downloaded from Heterocompound Information Center, Uppsala, Sweden (HIC-UP) (12Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Positive electron density greater than 5 ς in an ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ map was used for initial placement of heteroatoms. Solvent molecules were placed in the model using the water pick module of CNS. The criteria for placing solvent molecules were an ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ peak ≥ 4 ς, a 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ peak ≥ 1, and good hydrogen bonding interactions with protein atoms. Placement of waters was verified by visual inspection. When the model reached an R cryst of 0.23, NCS constraints were removed. The quality of the structure was assessed with both the WHATIF (13Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3356) Google Scholar, 14Rodriguez R. Chinea G. Lopez N. Pons T. Vriend G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1998; 14: 523-528Google Scholar) and PROCHECK (15Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) programs. The R153C·NAD·pyruvate complex was formed in the presence of NAD (7 mm) and pyruvate (20 mm) and co-crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion out of a solution of 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.1 m ammonium acetate. Crystals (0.2 × 0.2 × 0.5 mm) grown at 24 °C were obtained 3 days after microseeding from a stock seed solution. The data on the ternary complex were collected at room temperature on an R-AXIS IV Rigaku image-plate detector (MSC) mounted on a RU200 rotating anode generator. The data were indexed into a C2 space group with unit cell parameters of a = 147.41 Å, b = 52.85 Å, c = 169.91 Å, and β = 101.76° and scaled using the HKL suite, DENZO, and SCALEPACK (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). Again, the structure was solved with the molecular replacement technique using the coordinates from 1emd (1Hall M.D. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as the probe and the software, AMoRe (8Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). The NCS matrices relating the four monomers were obtained from AMoRe and used as a strict restraint in the initial stages of the refinement. CNS version 0.9a (10Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grossekunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar) was used for refinement, map calculations, and placement of solvent molecules. The program O (11Jones T. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) was used for density visualization and modeling. The density for NAD was identified, and the coordinates from the1emd structure matched the density well. Minor adjustments were done using O. Similarly, the pyruvate density was identified and the coordinates were obtained from the Uppsala Software Factory data base (12Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). After further refinement (R cryst = 0.30), NCS constraints were removed and all four monomers were refined independently. The electron density for the pyruvate molecules among the four subunits in the a.s.u. was not consistent. In subunit C, the 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ density, contoured at 1 ς, could account for the entire molecule. In the remaining three subunits, electron density in the 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ map was either entirely missing or overlapped with only the 2-hydroxyl group of pyruvate. A simulated annealing omit map of each active site was employed to determine if pyruvate could be modeled into the three remaining subunits. The omit map did not indicate continuous density for pyruvate in subunits A, B, or D, so coordinates for the ligand were omitted. The loop over the active site, residues 79–91, of each subunit was at least partially disordered. A composite omit map of the asymmetric unit was created to help interpret this area. Initially the occupancies for residues 79–91 of each subunit were set to zero. Starting from the two ends of the loop, residues were modeled into the electron density according to the omit and ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ maps contoured at 1 ς. One to two residues were usually placed during each session of model rebuilding and then subjected to positional and B factor refinement. The placement of a residue was again evaluated by an ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ map after each round of refinement. Of the four loops in the a.s.u., subunit B had the most contiguous electron density; only residue 87 was partially disordered. Subunits A, C, and D have residues 81–90, 80–86 and 83–86 disordered, respectively. Subsequently, the loop region for subunits A, C and D was modeled like subunit B with occupancies for disordered residues set to zero. The difficulties in modeling this region are reflected in the B factors, which average 85 Å2for residues 76–91 of subunits A, C and D. The R153C·NAD structure was used as the basis for the cysteine modification models. Coordinates for the modified side chains that had been introduced (6Wright S.K. Viola R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31151-31155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were first built onto the cysteine using the Biopolymer module of InsightII (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The modified cysteine side chain underwent one round of positional refinement in the Discover_3 module of InsightII using the minimize mode. The remainder of the molecule was fixed during refinement. The theoretical model of eMDH·NAD·malate (1cme) was superimposed onto the modified cysteine R153C model and the malate coordinates appended to the R153C modified cysteine model. The dihedral angles of the modified side chain were adjusted in Setor version 4.14.14 (17Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) to allow the most favorable position for hydrogen bonding interactions to the malate. Figs. 1 and 5 were prepared using Setor (17Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 were prepared using the software program SPOCK (by J. A. Christopher; available at quorum.tamu.edu/spock/). Figs. 2 and 4 are the product of a positive mask around the depicted atoms and the indicated electron density map.Figure 2Stereo diagrams of the NAD and NAD·pyruvate active sites. In both structures Cys-153 is no longer able to interact with anions or substrate bound in the active site and instead the sulfhydryl forms a hydrogen bond to a nearby water. A, the active site of R153C·NAD. A stereo diagram of the active site of subunit A with a 2.1Å 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ electron density map, contoured at 1 ς, enveloping the sulfate ions. The sulfate ions form hydrogen bonds to the guanidino groups of both Arg-81 and Arg-87, the amino group of Gly-179, Nε2 of His-177, and the Nδ1 of Asn-119. The nicotinamide ring position is stabilized by hydrogen bonds from the oxygen of the nicotinamide carboxamide to a solvent molecule and the Nε2 of the catalytic histidine (177) and the nitrogen of the carboxamide forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain oxygen of Ile-117. The binding site for sulfate A corresponds to the substrate binding site and maintains the same hydrogen bonding pattern. Sulfate B occupies a newly defined anion binding site. The majority of the hydrogen bonding interactions for this site arise from Arg-87. When substrate is bound, Arg-87 coordinates the 2-ketone/hydroxyl group during catalysis, but in the binary structure the closed loop may be stabilized by the second sulfate coordinating the positively charged Arg-87. B, the active site of R153C·NAD·pyruvate. A stereo diagram of the active site of subunit C, containing a bound pyruvate, superimposed with the water structure (green spheres) present in subunit B. Simulated annealing omit map density, contoured at 1 ς, depicts the placement of the pyruvate molecule. The pyruvate forms long and weak hydrogen bonds with the amino groups of residues Gly-179, Gly-210, and Thr-211. The lack of coordination by the remaining two arginines in the active site pocket (81 and 87) suggest that these residues are not necessary for ligand binding but for substrate orientation. Instead, in the open conformation, the main chain atoms lining the active site pocket may serve as an initial docking site for potential ligands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Comparing the open and closed conformations of the loop in R153C MDH. A, Cα trace of the active site loop and adjacent loop in R153C·NAD·pyruvate subunit B shows how the side chains of Arg-81 and Arg-87 have moved out of the active site and are solvent-exposed. A 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ map, contoured at 1 ς, for the active site loop highlights the shift in its position and the extension of the α-helix to residue 86. B, Cα trace of the active site loop and adjacent loop in R153C·NAD with 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ electron density, contoured at 1 ς, encompassing the loop and the bent helix which directs Arg-87 into the active site.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The sulfate ion, labeled C, of cytMDH when compared with sulfate A of the R153C·NAD structure is translated ∼2 Å farther into the active site. The hydrogen bonds between the sulfate and Ser-225 and Arg-153 provide the impetus for this translation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A summary of data collection statistics is given in Table I. The rotation and translation function studies initially placed one dimer in the asymmetric unit. Examination of the lattice packing clearly indicated the need for a second dimer that was subsequently placed using AMoRe. The Matthew's coefficient for two dimers in the asymmetric unit is 2.48 Å3/Da. NCS “strict” averaging was used to constrain one of the two dimers in the a.s.u. during the initial rounds of refinement. With two dimers in the a.s.u., reference to individual subunits is done alphabetically for both x-ray studies. Therefore, in the coordinates and molecular images, the subunits are labeled A, B, C, and D.Table IData collection statisticsNADNAD·pyruvateX-ray wavelength1.5418 Å1.5418 ÅCrystallization conditions0.1 m Tris-maleate, pH 6.00.2 m Sodium cacodylate, pH 6.524% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m(NH4)2SO420% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1m NH4-acetateUnit cella = 148.14 Å, b = 53.08 Å, c = 164.29 Å, β = 95.26 °a = 147.41 Å, b = 52.85 Å,c = 169.91 Å, β = 101.76 °Space groupC2C2Resolution2.1 Å2.5 ÅNo. of reflections201,84495,846No. of unique reflections73,72366,535Completeness (last shell)96.9% (84.8%)87.5% (90.0%)Subunit/a.s.u.44R merge1-aRmerge = (Σ‖I hkl − 〈I hkl〉‖/ΣI hkl) × 100.7.6%11.5%I/ςI8.88.5Redundancy2.71.41-a Rmerge = (Σ‖I hkl − 〈I hkl〉‖/ΣI hkl) × 100. Open table in a new tab Overall, the R153C·NAD structure is very similar to the wild type eMDH structure (1Hall M.D. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Hall M. Levitt D. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) with a root mean square deviation between Cα atoms of 0.4 Å. The cofactor, as in the native eMDH structure, forms hydrogen bonds primarily to main chain atoms (1Hall M.D. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The nicotinamide ring, in contrast to the Hall structure in which the cofactor may have been partially occluded from the active site by the carboxymethyl branch of the substrate analogue, citrate, has rotated about the nicotinamide glycosidic bond 57° farther into the active site. This ring movement was predicted in the theoretical model of eMDH·NAD·malate (1cme). The new orientation of the nicotinamide ring is stabilized by several hydrogen-bonding interactions: between the oxygen of the nicotinamide carboxamide to both the Nε2 of the catalytic histidine (177) and a solvent molecule and the nitrogen of the carboxamide to the carbonyl oxygen of Ile-117 (Fig. 2 A). The electron density for a portion of the active site in subunit B (residues 72–93) was poor and discontinuous. The occupancy for these residues was set to 0.5 and initially modeled by superimposing active site A onto active site B. Further modeling of active site B was then performed according to simulated annealing omit maps, ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ maps and 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ maps contoured at 0.75 ς. Also absent from active site B was electron density for either the cofactor or sulfate ions; therefore, both ligands were omitted during modeling.

Open table in a new tab In the R153C·NAD structure (Fig. 2 A), the anion pocket is occupied by two sulfate ions (S-A and S-B) from the crystallization medium. Sulfate A binds in the catalytic region of the active site, which, in previous crystal structures (1Hall M.D. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol.

The negative charges on the sulfate appears to be neutralized by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with the side chains of Arg-81, Arg-87, and Asn-119 and solvent molecules (TableIII, Fig. 2). The position of sulfate A was compared with the cytMDH·NAD structure (20Birktoft J.J. Rhodes G. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6065-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in which only one sulfate is bound in the active site (Fig.3). In cytMDH the sulfate ion interacts with the side chains of Arg-153, His-177, Ser-225 (Ala in E. coli), and Asn-119 (E. coli residue numbers, TableIII). However, in R153C MDH, the loss of the guanidino group at position 153 results in sulfate A shifting 2 Å closer to the mouth of the active site and taking advantage of the charge neutralization provided by Arg-81 and Arg-87.Table IIIHydrogen bond interactions with ligandsSubunit ASubunit CSubunit DSO 42−A3-aSulfate ions in the R153C·NAD structure.O1Nδ2 Asn-119(3.05)Nδ2 Asn-119(2.71)Nδ2 Asn-119(2.81)O1NH1 Arg-87(3.16)NH1 Arg-87(3.21)O1Nɛ2 His-177(3.22)Nɛ2 His-177(2.77)O2W355(2.73)W475(3.24)W535(2.63)O2W536(2.90)O3W346(2.55)W476(2.57)W534(2.71)O3Nδ2 Asn-119(3.05)O4NH1 Arg-87(2.98)NH1 Arg-87(2.71)NH1 Arg-87(2.56)O4NH2 Arg-81(2.91)NH2 Arg-81(2.75)NH2 Arg-81(2.63)O4W536(3.18)SO 42−B3-aSulfate ions in the R153C·NAD structure.O1N Arg-87(2.86)N Arg-87(3.07)N Arg-87(2.74)O1Nɛ Arg-87(3.07)O1W470(2.88)O2Oγ Ser-88(2.87)O3N Gly-179(3.08)N Gly-179(2.90)N Gly-179(2.64)O3Nɛ Arg-87(3.14)Nɛ Arg-87(2.80)Nɛ Arg-87(2.89)O3NH2 Arg-87(3.19)Pyruvate3-bPyruvate from the R153C·NAD·pyruvate structure.O1N Gly-179(3.77)O2N Gly-210(3.74)O2N Thr-211(3.85)O3Nɛ2 His-177(4.08)O3W478(3.61)Cytosol SO 42−3-cSulfate ion from the porcine cytoplasmic MDH structure (4mdh); residue numbers correspond to E. coli.O1Nδ2 Asn-119(2.64)O1Nɛ2 His-177(2.84)O2Oγ1 Ser-225(2.92)O3O4NH1 Arg-153(3.07)O4Nɛ2 His-177(3.18)() Hydrogen bonding distance in angstroms.3-a Sulfate ions in the R153C·NAD structure.3-b Pyruvate from the R153C·NAD·pyruvate structure.3-c Sulfate ion from the porcine cytoplasmic MDH structure (4mdh); residue numbers correspond to E. coli.

Through the use of new CD45 cDNA constructs and reporter genes, the role 5′, 3′, and intron sequences play in CD45 expression was determined. The CD45 polyadenylation signal sequence was fully functional in a β-galactosidase reporter construct. Furthermore, the CD45 3′-untranslated region and downstream sequences were shown to contain no negative regulatory elements. Several new CD45 cDNA constructs were designed that contain either the cytomegalovirus promoter, the leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1; CD11a) promoter, or various CD45 5′ regions. Neither the cytomegalovirus nor the LFA-1 promoter was capable of generating detectable levels of expression in constructs with CD45 cDNA. However, when CD45 intron sequences between exons 3 and 9 were inserted in the cDNA construct to generate a CD45 minigene, the LFA-1 promoter was able to drive reproducible, significant expression of CD45. CD45 minigenes using the CD45 5′ sequences up to 19 kilobases upstream of the transcriptional start produced very little protein. The LFA-1 CD45 minigene construct produced correct cell type-specific isoforms when expressed in T and B lymphocyte lines. Therefore, we conclude that the regulation of CD45 expression and cell type-specific splicing requires elements within the intron sequences.

The protein is structurally heterogenous, consisting of isoforms ranging in size from 180 to 220 kDa. The heterogeneity of the protein results from differential RNA splicing of at least five and perhaps six exons encoding part of the extracellular domain (1Chang H.L. Lefrancois L. Zaroukian M.H.

The CD45 exon usage pattern is highly regulated by the different leukocyte populations and is cell type-specific. The predominant isoform expressed by B cells contains all variable exons (B220+) (4Shen F.W. Saga Y. Litman G. Freeman G. Tung J.S. Cantor H. Boyse E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Peripheral T cells express multiple splice variants and have a varied isoform expression pattern that is dependent upon the differentiation state, function, and prior antigenic exposure (2Virts E. Barritt D. Raschke W.C. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mast cells and monocytes also produce specific sets of CD45 isoforms, which are distinctive for each myleoid cell type (12Virts E. Barritt D. Siden E. Raschke W.C. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1191-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition to the protein structural differences, polymorphic sequence variations in the CD45 gene led to the identification of three alleles in inbred murine strains, Ly5 a (CD45.1),Ly5 b (CD45.2), and Ly5 c (13Seldin M.F. D'Hoostelaere L.A. Steinberg A.D. Saga Y. Morse H.C.D. Immunogenetics. 1987; 26: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The CD45.2 allele is expressed by most of the established strains, while the CD45.1 allele is found in only a few (13Seldin M.F. D'Hoostelaere L.A. Steinberg A.D. Saga Y. Morse H.C.D. Immunogenetics. 1987; 26: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The CD45.1 and CD45.2 alleles are distinguished antigenically by their reactivity to specific monoclonal antibodies, and the nucleotide changes that produce the antigenic differences have been identified (3Zebedee S.L. Barritt D.S. Raschke W.C. Dev. Immunol. 1991; 1: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). CD45 is encoded by a single gene, and expression appears to be regulated at the level of transcription (14Raschke W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The murine gene is characterized by 34 exons and a large 50-kilobase (kb)1 intron between exons 2 and 3. CD45 transcription can initiate at three distinct sites in exon 1a, exon 1b, and downstream of exon 1b (15DiMartino J.F. Hayes P. Saga Y. Lee J.S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the sequences responsible for the developmental and tissue-specific transcription of CD45 have yet to be identified. Extensive analyses have demonstrated that CD45 is required to generate signaling through both the T and B cell receptors (16Justement L.B. Campbell K.S. Chien N.C. Cambier J.C.

The role of CD45 in signaling in other lymphoid lineages is less well defined, although reports suggest that the CD45 phosphatase activity is important in regulating signal transduction in mast cells through the high affinity receptor for IgE, FcεRI (29Berger S.A.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Much less is known about the functional significance of the extracellular domain, although the isoform differences most likely convey ligand specificity. Studies have shown that the isoforms differentially affect activation through the T cell receptor (31Novak T.J. Farber D. Leitenberg D. Hong S.C. Johnson P. Bottomly K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Hall S.R. Heffernan B.M. Thompson N.T. Rowan W.C. Eur. J.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The expression of specific isoforms has also been implicated in T cell apopotosis (35Ong C.J. Chui D. Teh H.S. Marth J.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3793-3805PubMed Google Scholar, 36Oka S. Mori N. Matsuyama S. Takamori Y. Kubo K.

Greenbaum L. Bottomly K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or by the thymocyte-specific proximal lck promoter and the human growth hormone minigene (39Chui D. Ong C.J. Johnson P. Teh H.S. Marth J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 798-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 40Marth J.D. Ong C.J. Chui D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 365: 149-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Expression from these CD45 cDNA constructs is not obtained consistently (41Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), and in transgenic mice, the lck-controlled cDNAs only express 10–30% of endogenous CD45 protein levels (40Marth J.D. Ong C.J. Chui D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 365: 149-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ sequences used to regulate expression from these cDNA constructs differ considerably from those controlling the endogenous CD45 gene. The proximallck promoter is expressed in thymocytes but not in peripheral T cells (42Wildin R.S. Wang H.U. Forbush K.A. Perlmutter R.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1286-1295PubMed Google Scholar), a pattern of expression that is much restricted compared with endogenous CD45. In contrast, expression from the retroviral LTR promoter should be constitutive, but this construct lacks a discernible polyadenylation sequence in proximity to the CD45 cDNA. In addition, the 3′ sequences may contribute significantly to the expression of these cDNAs. Signals for controlling mRNA translation, stability, and localization have been found in the 3′-UTR of some genes, indicating that these sequences can contain key information for both positive and negative regulation of mRNA (43Decker C.J. Parker R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,44Wickens M. Anderson P. Jackson R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Therefore, the difficulty in consistently obtaining expression from these CD45 cDNA constructs may be due in part to the 5′ and 3′ regulatory elements used. To address the roles of these gene elements, we designed new CD45 cDNA vectors. Sections of the 3′-end of the CD45 gene downstream of the translational termination codon were evaluated in reporter gene constructs and in CD45 cDNA vectors. Regions of the 5′-end of the CD45 gene as large as 19 kb upstream of the initiation codon were tested for promoter activity and compared with the promoter for the human LFA-1 gene, a gene with similar expression characteristics to CD45. We also tested the effect of the introns between exons 3 and 9 in CD45 expression constructs. These introns flank the principal alternatively expressed exons 4–8. Here we report that by using these novel constructs, we are able to identify components that generate reproducible expression of CD45 in a variety of hematopoietic cell types. These results suggest that the CD45 intron sequences contain information necessary for expression from the transgenes. Furthermore, the intron sequences flanking the alternatively spliced exons provide correct leukocyte lineage-specific splicing. 70Z/3 is a methylnitrosourea-induced murine pre-B lymphoblast cell line. Transfection of 70Z/3 was performed by electroporation in cuvettes with a 3.5-mm gap. After adding 25 μg of linearized DNA to 1 × 107 cells in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the DNA-cell complex was kept on ice for 10 min and then placed in a BTX Transfector 300 (BTX, La Jolla, CA) for electroporation (settings: capacitance, 1400 microfarads; voltage, 200 V).

Twenty micrograms of linearized plasmid DNA were mixed with 1 × 107 cells in PBS, and immediately electroporation (800 microfarads and 250 V) was performed.

BW5147, a murine thymic lymphoma cell line, was transfected using 1 × 107 cells in PBS and 25 μg of linearized plasmid DNA. The mixture of cells and DNA was incubated on ice for 10 min prior to electroporation (250 V and 2200 microfarads). After electroporation, the cells were placed on ice for 10 min and then resuspended in growth medium. After 48 h, the cells were placed in medium containing 1.0 mg/ml G418. Human embryonal kidney cells (293) were transfected using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.).

For transfection, 6 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA, 40 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 300 μl of unsupplemented growth medium were mixed and kept for 15 min. at room temperature. After the 293 cells were washed two times with unsupplemented medium, the DNA/lipid mixture was added and incubated with the cells for 5 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with supplemented medium and grown in 10 ml of medium for 48 h. S49 is a murine T lymphoma cell line provided by Robert Hyman (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Transfection was performed by electroporation (250 V, 1400 microfarads). The human T cell leukemia line, Jurkat, was obtained from Javi Piedrafita (Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA). Jurkat was transfected using DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's directions. All cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) unless otherwise indicated. The growth medium for the cell lines was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin except for 70Z/3, which was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, 1.0 mmsodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.05 mm2-mercaptoetanol, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. All media components were from Irvine Scientific (Irvine, CA). To study CD45 cDNA expression in a variety of leukocyte populations, we obtained three constructs. The plasmid, pARV/CD45 (H), was kindly provided by K. Bottomly (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). This plasmid is a modification of pARV/CD45 (38Johnson P. Greenbaum L. Bottomly K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in which the neomycin gene was replaced with the hygromycin gene (31Novak T.J. Farber D. Leitenberg D. Hong S.C. Johnson P. Bottomly K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Since selection for hygromycin resistance in leukocytes is inefficient, we removed the hygromycin gene as a ClaI fragment and reinserted the neomycin gene (GKneo), creating pARV/CD45 (N). The neomycin gene from pGKneocbpA (Eva Lee, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA) was used and contains the mammalian phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and the bovine growth hormone poly(A) sequence. The CD45 cDNA plasmids, pML84 and pML171, were obtained from J. Marth (Department of Medicine and Division of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). The full-length cDNA is present in pML84 (CD45RABC), while pML171 carries the CD45 cDNA encoding the isoform missing exons 4–6 (CD45RO). In these vectors, the transgenes are inserted 3′ of the proximal lck promoter and upstream of the human growth hormone gene (40Marth J.D. Ong C.J. Chui D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 365: 149-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We added the GKneo NotI fragment into the NotI site of each plasmid to facilitate selection of stable transfectants. In all of the cDNA transgenes, the 3200-base pair (bp) XbaI fragment containing the CD45.2 allelic sequence was replaced with the corresponding XbaI fragment specifying the sequences for the CD45.1 allele. To test the 3′ CD45 sequences, the plasmids pSPORT-(−A), pSPORT-BGA, pSPORT-XR, and pSPORT-EA, were generated (Fig. 1 A). These plasmids are derivatives of pCMVSPORTβgal (Life Technologies). The SV40 small t/poly(A) site of pCMVSPORTβgal was removed creating pSPORT-(−A) (Fig. 1 A). The SV40 small t/poly(A) was replaced by a 280-bp XbaI to XhoI bovine growth hormone poly(A) insert from pGKneocbpA to produce pSPORT-BGA (Fig. 1 A). An 868-bp XbaI toEcoRI piece from CD45 exon 33 was introduced into pSPORT-(−A), generating pSPORT-X (not shown). The XbaI site lies 15 bp downstream from the CD45 stop signal, and theEcoRI site is 165 bp upstream from the 3′-end of the CD45 mRNA (3Zebedee S.L. Barritt D.S. Raschke W.C. Dev. Immunol. 1991; 1: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An adjacent 800-bp EcoRI fragment containing the remaining 3′ portion of exon 33 and all CD45 polyadenylation signals were cloned into pSPORT-X, resulting in pSPORT-XR (Fig.1 A). This EcoRI fragment also was introduced into pCMVSPORTβgal upstream from the SV40 small t/poly(A) creating pSPORT-EA (Fig. 1 A). To study the effect of 5′ sequences on CD45 cDNA expression, the constructs pLFAT200 and pCMVT200 (Fig. 1 B) were made by subcloning all components into pBluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The 5′ cDNA from T200/3/pAX (38Johnson P. Greenbaum L. Bottomly K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) containing all alternatively spliced exons (exons 4–8) was inserted as aClaI/XbaI fragment. The 3′ CD45 DNA was subcloned from pSPORT-XR as a 1800-bp XbaI/EcoRI fragment (striped box in Fig. 1 A). The remaining cDNA region obtained from a CD45.1 allele (3Zebedee S.L. Barritt D.S. Raschke W.C. Dev. Immunol. 1991; 1: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) extended from exon 9 through 33 and was inserted as a 3200-bp XbaI fragment. A 1800-bp SalI/ClaI fragment containing the human leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1, CD11a) promoter was inserted 5′ of the CD45 cDNA sequences. The LFA-1 promoter was obtained by PCR amplification from DNA isolated from the human T lymphocyte line, Jurkat. The sense primer extended from position −1694 to −1668 of the LFA-1 promoter (46Cornwell R.D. Gollahon K.A. Hickstein D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and contained uniqueSalI and SfiI sites at the 5′-end. The antisense primer extended from +77 to +96 of the LFA-1 promoter (46Cornwell R.D. Gollahon K.A. Hickstein D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and had unique ClaI and SgfI sites engineered at the 3′-end of the LFA-1 sequence. The construct, pLFAT200 (Fig.1 B), was completed by the addition of the neomycin gene (GKneo). The LFA promoter was replaced with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter to generate pCMVT200 (Fig. 1 B) by digestion of pLFAT200 with SfiI and ClaI and insertion of aNruI/HindIII fragment from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To investigate regulatory sequences within the introns, the CD45 minigene construct, pLFAiT200 (Fig. 1 C), was made by inserting all components into a modified mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 in which the CMV promoter had been replaced by the 1800-bp fragment containing the LFA-1 promoter. The 5′ CD45 cDNA/intron region in LFAiT200 starts in exon 1b at an NheI site, 27 bp from the beginning of the exon, continues through exons 2 and 3, and ends within the 3/4 intron at a BglII site, 500 bp downstream from exon 3. Two PCR products were used to generate this region. PCR amplification of cDNA extending from exon 1b to 3 produced the first fragment, and amplification of CD45 genomic DNA containing exon 3 and intron sequences 3′ to exon 3 resulted in the second. The fragment was completed by ligating the two PCR products. A λ genomic clone carrying CD45 exons 3–8 was used to obtain aBglII to BamHI fragment containing exon 4. This fragment was inserted downstream from exon 3 at the BglII (intron) and BamHI (vector) sites. The genomic sequences, extending from the BamHI site 550 bp upstream of exon 5 to an XhoI site 600 bp downstream of exon 8, were taken from a λ genomic clone, placed into the plasmid vector pGEM11Z (Promega, Madison, WI) and subsequently transferred to the minigene construct as a BamHI/NotI fragment generating plasmid pLFA1–8. The genomic region containing exons 8 and 9 was amplified by PCR from mouse genomic DNA and subcloned as a 2000-bpHindIII/EcoRI fragment into pGEM11Z, creating pG11(8–9). For this amplification, the 35-bp sense oligonucleotide primer was the complete exon 8 sequence, and the antisense primer extended from base 192 to 215 of exon 9. The PCR amplification fragment included the XhoI site downstream from exon 8 and theXbaI restriction site within exon 9. The XbaI toEcoRI 3′ CD45 DNA fragment in pSPORT-XR was inserted into pG11(8–9) as an XbaI/NotI fragment generating pG11(8–9)A. A CD45.1 cDNA region (3Zebedee S.L. Barritt D.S. Raschke W.C. Dev. Immunol. 1991; 1: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) extending from exon 9 to 33 was subcloned into pG11(8–9)A as an XbaI fragment producing pG11(8-A). The CD45 minigene construct, pLFAiT200, was completed by the introduction of the XhoI/NotI restriction fragment from pG11(8-A) into pLFA1–8. The final construct contains CD45 sequence consisting of a cDNA 5′ region (exons 1b–3), a genomic DNA region extending from exon 3 to exon 9, a cDNA segment from exon 9 to exon 33, and 3′ gene sequences from exon 33 to 750 bp downstream of the end of transcriptional termination. The potential promoter region upstream of exon 1a was isolated from a λ genomic library constructed in the LambdaGEM-12 cloning vector (Promega). The longest λ clone extended ∼19 kb upstream and 1800 bp downstream of the CD45 translational start site. The insert was flanked by NotI sites from the vector. A partial restriction map of a subsection of this DNA is shown in Fig. 1 D; theNheI site maps within exon 1b. The entire upstream region was subcloned into plasmid pGEM5Z as three smaller fragments: a 15-kbNotI/PstI fragment consisting of the most upstream 5′ sequences (pG5NP); a 1.3-kb PstI fragment (pG5P); and a 4.5 kb, PstI/NotI fragment including exons 1a, 1b, and 2 as well as 1.7 kb of intron sequence 3′ of exon 2 (pG5PN). The 5′ NotI site was changed to aSfiI site using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a NotI overhang and an internal SfiI site. Using the natural EcoRI, PstI, and NheI sites and the synthetic SfiI site, the following plasmids were generated: pCD45FiT200, pCD45EiT200, pCD45PiT200, and pCD45P2iT200 (Fig. 1 D). Total RNA was purified from cells using TRIZOL (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's directions. Fifty micrograms RNA isolated from cells transfected with plasmids pLFAT200 and pCMVT200 were treated with 1 unit of DNase I (Promega) for 1 h at 37 °C. The DNase I was removed by one extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol followed by one extraction with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol as suggested by Promega. The RNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in RNase-free water. RT-PCR was performed using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to distinguish transgene CD45.1 mRNA transcripts from the endogenous CD45.2 transcripts of the transfected cells. All RT and PCR reactions were assembled according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The antisense oligonucleotide used for cDNA synthesis, 5′-GAGACCAGAAACTCATAG-3′, contains the last 13 bp of exon 14 and the first 5 bp of exon 15. For the PCR component, the sense oligonucleotide primer was the complete exon 3 sequence, 5′-GGCAAACACCTACACCCAGTGATG-3′. The antisense oligonucleotides are specific for the CD45.1 (Ly5 a) and CD45.2 (Ly5 b) alleles (3Zebedee S.L. Barritt D.S. Raschke W.C. Dev. Immunol. 1991; 1: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 47Raschke W.C. Hendricks M. Chen C.M. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and consist of bases 86–106 of exon 12. The sequences of these antisense primers are as follows with the allele-specific bases underlined: CD45.1, 5′-CCATGGGGTTTAGATGCAGGA-3′ and CD45.2, 5′-CCATGGGGTTTAGATGCAGAC-3′. The cDNA was synthesized for 1 h at 42 °C followed by 5 min at 95 °C. The cDNA was amplified for 34 cycles. The first cycle consisted of 2 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 63 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The remaining cycles were 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 63 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The amplified products were separated on a standard TBE-agarose gel (48Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

The technique of site-specific modulation has been used to alter the substrate binding site of this enzyme. Introduction of a cysteine in place of the active site binding residue arginine 153 results in a mutant enzyme with diminished catalytic activity, but withK m values for malate and oxaloacetate that are surprisingly unaffected. Reaction of this introduced cysteine with a series of amino acid analog reagents leads to the incorporation of a range of functional groups at the active site of malate dehydrogenase. The introduction of a positively charged group such as an amine or an amidine at this position results in improved affinity for several inhibitors over that observed with the native enzyme. However, the recovery of catalytic activity is less dramatic, with less than one third of the native activity achieved with the optimal reagents. These modified enzymes do have altered substrate specificity, with α-ketoglutarate and hydroxypyruvate no longer functioning as alternative substrates.

Malate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli(eMDH)1 catalyzes the interconversion of malate and oxaloacetate, a critical step in carbohydrate metabolism. In eukaryotes the production of oxaloacetate in the mitochondria is required to accept the acetyl-coenzyme A that is generated from the catabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and certain amino acids. The cytosolic form of this enzyme is involved in the malate/aspartate shuttle that exchanges reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial membrane. As expected for the catalysis of this important metabolic reaction, malate dehydrogenase in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is highly selective for malate and oxaloacetate, with strong discrimination against other 2-keto mono- and dicarboxylic acids (1Nicholls D.J. Miller J. Scawen M.D. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Atkinson T. Goward C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Examination of the crystal structure of malate dehydrogenase from E. coli (2Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) provides an explanation for the high substrate selectivity that is observed with this enzyme. The substrate appears to be bound at both ends through electrostatic interactions of its two carboxyl groups with complementary arginyl side chains that are precisely positioned to interact with a four carbon dicarboxylic acid (Fig. 1). Additional constraints are placed by the location of the catalytic histidine and by the positioning of the nicotinamide coenzyme for hydride transfer. Several attempts at altering the specificity of this highly selective enzyme have been made, with limited success (1Nicholls D.J. Miller J. Scawen M.D. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Atkinson T. Goward C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Boernke W.E. Millard C.S. Stevens P.W. Kakar S.N. Stevens F.J. Donnelly M.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It appears that significant changes in specificity will require the additional flexibility of chemical modification to incorporate new functional groups into the active site of eMDH. In this report we have examined the effect of introducing unnatural amino acids at a single active site position on the substrate specificity of eMDH. The pEM6 plasmid containing the mdhgene that encodes for eMDH was a gift from Dr. Norb Furumo (Eastern Illinois University, Charleston, IL). Restriction endonucleases and molecular weight markers were purchased from New England Biolabs. Electrophoresis grade agarose was purchased from SeaChem. Primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Native PfuDNA polymerase and the PCR optimization kit were purchased from Stratagene. Affi-blue resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. Iodoacetamide and 2-chloroacetamidine were obtained from Lancaster and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Purification of the enzyme was performed according to the previously published scheme (4Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. McAllister-Henn L. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of malate dehydrogenase was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring either the formation or the utilization of NADH (E 3 4 0 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1). Standard assay conditions were as follows: 50 mm buffer, 2 mmEDTA, 100 mm KCl, and variable concentrations of the substrates NADH and oxaloacetic acid (OAA) or NAD and malate (5Wright S.K. Zhao F.J. Rardin J. Milbrandt J. Helton M. Furumo N.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Inhibition studies were performed in either the direction of malate oxidation or OAA reduction. Conditions for the malate oxidation direction were: 50 mm Taps, pH 9.0, saturating NAD (7 mm), 5.0 mm malate, and varying concentrations of malate analogs. For the OAA reduction direction, conditions were: 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.15 mm NADH (saturating), 0.2 mm OAA, and varying concentrations of OAA analogs. Each reaction was initiated by the addition of 7 nm active sites of native enzyme. For examination of alternative substrates with modified eMDHs, the enzyme concentrations were increased, in some cases up to 0.7 µm. The kinetic data were fitted by using an Enzyme Kinetics software package (SciTech International, Chicago, IL) to obtain the kinetic parameters. Inhibition constants were determined by a Dixon analysis (6Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar) and are corrected for the higher levels of substrates relative to their K m values. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (7Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using recombinant circle PCR. The recombinant circle-polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR) method (8Tarragona-Fiol A. Eggelte H.J. Harbron S. Sanchez E. Taylorson C.J. Ward J.M. Rabin B.R. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Jones D.H. White B.A. PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 269-276Google Scholar) utilizes four primers (two mutagenic and two non-mutagenic) that are designed to generate double-stranded, linear DNA molecules with blunt ends. Once combined, denatured, and reannealed, this linear DNA produces double-stranded DNA with discrete cohesive single-stranded ends, in addition to the previously made blunt end molecules. However, only the former PCR product will anneal to form recombinant circles of DNA that can effectively mimic the circular DNA that is necessary to be transformed into TG-1 cells. This method was successfully utilized for the production of the linear DNA that then allowed the creation of a mutagenic site within the malate dehydrogenase gene. The specific changes introduced were to alter the DNA sequence in the region of interest that codes for the amino acid at position 153 to ACatATGAT, where the mismatched bases to create the mutagenic arginine to cysteine replacement and the newly introduced NdeI restriction endonuclease site are shown in lowercase, with the restriction site underlined. For the R153E mutant, the sequence A TATgga TTC was used to substitute a glutamate at this position and destroy the introducedNdeI restriction site. Initial screening for the presence of mutagenic colonies was accomplished by restriction enzyme mapping. Chemical modulation of R153C eMDH with the amino acid analog reagents 2-chloroacetamidine, 2-bromoethylamine, 3-bromopropylamine, 2-chloroacetamide, 3-chloropropylamide, and 2-chloroacetic acid were performed in 250 mm borate buffer, pH 8.8, using an enzyme concentration of 4 mg/ml and reagent concentrations of 10–40 mm. The reactions were incubated for various times up to 12 h at 4 °C and were terminated by the removal of excess reagent by Amicon Centricon-30, followed by three successive washes with the standard assay buffer. The content of free cysteine was initially determined by the method of Ellman (10Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21373) Google Scholar) using 2,2′-dithiobis(5-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) at pH 7 and quantitating the product formed at 412 nm. The stoichiometry of cysteine modification by the amino acid analog reagents was determined by monitoring the decrease in the free cysteine content of the enzyme. When additional precision was required, the standard method of cysteine determination was supplemented (11Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) by using either fluorescent methods or by an enzyme amplification assay. The active site arginine (Arg-153) that interacts with the α-carboxyl group of the substrate (Fig. 1) has been replaced with a cysteine by using the RC-PCR method. The resulting R153C mutant was purified using the purification procedure that was developed for the native enzyme (4Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. McAllister-Henn L. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for this mutant were compared with those of native eMDH. Replacement of this arginine with a cysteine leads to an enzyme form with a k cat that is about 7% that of the native enzyme. However, the K mfor malate (1.4 mm in the native enzyme) is essentially unaffected (1.9 mm in the R153C mutant) by the removal of this binding arginine residue, and the K m for oxaloacetate increases but only by a factor of two (TableI).Table IChemical modulation of position 153 in malate dehydrogenase Native eMDH contains 3 cysteines/subunit. Treatment of the enzyme with DTNB under denaturing conditions (4 m guanidine HCl) leads to the modification of all three cysteines in the native enzyme and, in the R153C mutant, the fourth cysteine that was introduced is also modified under these conditions. However, when the titration with DTNB is conducted under non-denaturing conditions, a slow modification (>30 min) is observed of a single cysteine per subunit in the native enzyme. The introduction of a cysteine at position 153 places a reactive nucleophile within the active site of eMDH. Incubation of the R153C mutant with DTNB under non-denaturing conditions leads to the rapid (<5 min) modification of a single cysteine. If the reaction is allowed to proceed for an extended period, the slow modification of a second cysteine is observed. From the high reactivity of this first cysteine, the site of modification in the mutant eMDH appears to be at the introduced cysteine 153. To support this assignment, the rate of reaction of the slowly modified cysteine in the eMDH mutant was examined and was found to be indistinguishable from that of the single accessible cysteine that is modified in the native enzyme. Treatment of the R153C mutant with moderate levels of most of the amino acid analog reagents results in the selective modification of only the most reactive cysteine (1.0 ± 0.2 cysteines modified/subunit) that has been assigned to the cysteine introduced at position 153. For the more reactive reagents, particularly those with bromide as the leaving group, both the introduced cysteine and the non-essential exposed cysteine can be modified (2.0 ± 0.2 cysteines modified/subunit) under these conditions at extended reaction times. However, even in these cases, the introduced cysteine shows significantly higher reactivity with these reagents than does the native cysteine. Modification of the native cysteine with DTNB, or with some of the more reactive amino acid analog reagents, has a negligible effect on the kinetics of native eMDH, with bothk cat andk cat/K m for the modified enzyme remaining at 80–90% of the values for the unmodified enzyme. Based on these results, the R153C mutant can now be specifically chemically modulated by using various amino acid analog reagents to introduce a range of functional groups into the active site of eMDH. Modification of this introduced cysteine with 2-chloroacetamidine results in the incorporation of an acetamidine (AAn) group and thus the generation of a homoarginine analog. This new active site functional group does not lead to significant recovery of activity; however, there is a 5-fold decrease in theK m for oxaloacetate to a value that is nearly 3-foldlower than that of the native enzyme (Table I). Modifications at this position to incorporate either amine (lysine analogs) or amide (glutamine analogs) functional groups at this position lead to modest changes in the kinetic parameters. In each case the longer homolog results in the greater improvement, with the propylamide-modified enzyme having a k cat that is about 25% of the native enzyme and the propylamine-modified enzyme at about 30% of the native k cat value (TableI). These modifications that have been introduced were aimed at generating reasonable structural analogs of the active site arginine that was removed. It is also possible to use this approach to characterize the role of an active site group by disrupting the enzyme-substrate interactions. Mutation of arginine 153 to glutamate places a negative charge in the vicinity of the substrate α-carboxyl binding site and should result in decreased affinity for the physiological substrates. As expected, the K m for OAA increases but only by a factor of 3. The position of this carboxyl group can be extended by the modulation of cysteine 153 with a halocarboxylic acid. Introduction of an acetate group leads to a further decrease ink cat and ink cat/K m to less than 10% of the values observed for the native enzyme (Table I). The changes that have been introduced into the active site as a result of these chemical modulations were next investigated through a series of inhibition studies aimed at focusing exclusively on alterations in binding affinity. Generation of the R153C mutation results in an increase in the inhibition constant for pyruvate (a 3-carbon substrate analog) and α-ketoglutarate (a 5-carbon substrate analog) of 2–3-fold compared with that with the native enzyme (Table II). Specific modifications of this introduced cysteine with a variety of amino acid analog reagents leads to further alterations in binding specificity. Modification of R153C through the introduction of an AAn group at this position leads to enhanced binding for each inhibitor that was examined when compared with the unmodified mutant enzyme. β-Ketoglutarate interacts with the AAn-modified enzyme 4-fold tighter than with the native enzyme, and the interaction with mercaptosuccinate is 6-fold tighter (both shown in bold in Table II). The ethylamine-modified enzyme shows a similar increase in affinity for mercaptosuccinate.Table IIBinding specificity (Ki, mm) of modified R153C malate dehydrogenasesInhibitorsNativeR153CR153C-AAnR153C-EAmR153C-PAmR153C-AAdR153C-PAdR153ER153C-AcPyruvate [CH3C(=O)-COO−]25 ± 456 ± 515 ± 122 ± 134 ± 336 ± 825 ± 330 ± 522 ± 4α-Ketoglutarate [−OOC-(CH2)2C(=O)-COO−]4.5 ± 0.712 ± 23.7 ± 0.48.8 ± 1.020 ± 2 2-aSignificant improvements in binding affinities are shown in bold, whereas significant decreases in affinities are shown in bold italics.17 ± 43.4 ± 0.312 ± 120 ± 1β-Ketoglutarate [−OOC-CH2C(=O)CH2-COO−]49 ± 931 ± 513 ± 345 ± 647 ± 1193 ± 754 ± 330 ± 9127 ± 14l-Lactate [CH3CH(−OH)-COO−]9 ± 1190 ± 2020 ± 330 ± 729 ± 57.6 ± 1.425 ± 4340 ± 3516 ± 5d-Lactate [CH3CH(−OH)-COO−]27 ± 250 ± 542 ± 663 ± 19NI 2-bNo inhibition is observed at concentrations up to 175 mm.31 ± 527 ± 67.6 ± 1.78.6 ± 1.1Mercaptosuccinate [−OOC-CH2CH(−SH)-COO−]14 ± 112 ± 12.3 ± 0.51.9 ± 0.1ND2-cNot determined.ND4.6 ± 0.7NDNDEam, ethylamine; PAm, propylamine; AAd, acetamide; PAd, propylamide; AAn, acetamidine; Ac, acetate.2-a Significant improvements in binding affinities are shown in bold, whereas significant decreases in affinities are shown in bold italics.2-b No inhibition is observed at concentrations up to 175 mm.2-c Not determined.

Introduction of a carboxyl group at this position, by mutation of arginine 153 to glutamate, does not affect the binding of either pyruvate or β-ketoglutarate, but does cause a 3-fold decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for α-ketoglutarate. Extending the carboxylate further into the binding pocket by modification of R153C with an acetate group leads to a 4-fold decrease in the affinity for both α- and β-ketoglutarate, but has no effect on the binding of pyruvate when compared with the native enzyme. For the hydroxyacid substrates, the affinity of R153C forl-lactate, the 3-carbon analog of malate, decreases by over 20-fold when compared with the native enzyme (Table II). Native eMDH shows a 3-fold stereochemical discrimination for the binding ofl-lactate as an inhibitor over the d-isomer; however, this selectivity is reversed when arginine 153 is substituted by cysteine. There is a return to the stereochemical preference for binding the l-isomer of lactate over thed-isomer when this position is modified by the introduction of an acetamidine, an acetamide, or an ethylamine functional group (Table II). In the case of the propylamine-modified enzyme, absolute binding specificity for the l-isomer is observed, with no inhibition by d-lactate up to a concentration of 175 mm, while in contrast the corresponding propylamide-modified enzyme shows no discrimination in the binding of these isomers. The introduction of a carboxylate at this position in R153E leads to enhanced affinity for the binding of d-lactate, with over a 40-fold preference when compared with l-lactate. However, when the position of this carboxyl group is extended (R153C-Ac), the stereochemical selectivity for the binding of the d-isomer decreases to only a factor of 2. eMDH is highly selective for malate and oxaloacetate as substrates. However, when examined at sufficiently high concentrations, several alternative substrates have been reported (1Nicholls D.J. Miller J. Scawen M.D. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Atkinson T. Goward C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The reduction of α-ketoglutarate, the 5-carbon analog of OAA, is catalyzed at a rate that is only 2% that of the physiological substrate and has a k cat/K mthat is decreased by about 104 (TableIII). Both hydroxypyruvate and phenylpyruvate are also weak alternative substrates for eMDH, with similar k cat/K m and enhancedk cat values compared with α-ketoglutarate. However, the k cat values with these substrates are still only 15–25% that with OAA. A wide range of additional substrate structural analogs have been examined, including α-ketobutyrate, pyruvate, and acetoacetate, that show no activity with native eMDH even when examined at very high levels.Table IIIAlternative substrates for malate dehydrogenaseSubstrateNative enzymeR153CR153C-AAnk cat3-aThe standard errors onk cat are ±10% or less.k cat/K mk cat3-aThe standard errors onk cat are ±10% or less.k cat/K mk cat3-aThe standard errors onk cat are ±10% or less.k cat/K ms−1m−1s−1s−1m−1s−1s−1m−1 s−1Oxaloacetate3-bThe physiological substrate is shown in bold.7801.9 × 1071101.2 × 106653.8 × 106α-Ketoglutarate182.3 × 103—3-cNo activity observed at concentrations up to 100 mm.———Pyruvate——905.7 × 103——Hydroxypyruvate1101.0 × 103<13-dVery low activity that could not be quantitated.<1——Phenylpyruvate2008.6 × 10389.6 × 1021204.5 × 1033-a The standard errors onk cat are ±10% or less.3-b The physiological substrate is shown in bold.3-c No activity observed at concentrations up to 100 mm.3-d Very low activity that could not be quantitated. Open table in a new tab Removal of arginine 153, the enzyme functional group that interacts with the α-carboxyl group of the substrate, leads to a decrease in catalytic efficiency. Both phenylpyruvate and hydroxypyruvate remain weak substrates for the R153C mutant. The k catfor phenylpyruvate decreases by a factor of 25 and an even greater decrease is seen for hydroxypyruvate compared with the native enzyme. The substrate activity of α-ketoglutarate can no longer be detected with the R153C mutant. However, unexpectedly, pyruvate is now found to be an alternative substrate with a k cat that is comparable to that of the physiological substrate with this mutant, but with k cat/K m that is still over 200-fold lower than that of OAA. Modification of R153C by the introduction of an acetamidine functional group does not result in recovery of the capability of the enzyme to reduce either α-ketoglutarate or hydroxypyruvate. In addition, the catalysis of pyruvate that was obtained upon replacement of arginine 153 with cysteine is lost when this introduced cysteine is modified (Table III). Similar losses of activity are observed upon modification of cysteine 153 with either ethylamine or propylamine. However, the acetamidine-modified enzyme does retain the capability to reduce phenylpyruvate, with enhanced kinetic parameters to values that approach those observed with the native enzyme. Cysteines contain an inherently reactive sulfhydryl group that is the most potent nucleophile among the naturally occurring amino acids. However, in proteins, these functional groups are frequently found either in disulfide linkages or in the solvent-inaccessible interior (12Wako H. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In most cases, treatment of proteins with thiol reagents under non-denaturing conditions will result in the modification of only the accessible surface cysteines. Only one of the three cysteines per subunit that are found in native eMDH reacts with the amino acid analog reagents that have been examined, and this modification reaction is very slow despite a wide range in the inherent reactivity of these reagents with sulfhydryl groups (13Schindler J.F. Viola R.E. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). An examination of the structure of eMDH shows that two of the cysteines in the native enzyme are buried in the protein interior, and only one, the presumed site of reaction, is partially solvent exposed. Furthermore, the modification of this single cysteine has been shown to have a negligible effect on the kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by eMDH. The R153C mutant contains an additional cysteine that is modified by these reagents, and this introduced cysteine is significantly more reactive than the partially exposed native cysteine. Incubation of R153C eMDH with any of the amino acid analog reagents for short periods of time under non-denaturing conditions results in the modification of only the introduced cysteine. From these observations, it appears that the modification of the introduced cysteine at position 153 is responsible for the kinetic changes that are observed. Lactate and malate dehydrogenases are structurally and mechanistically related keto acid dehydrogenases (2Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Grau U.M. Trommer W.E. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 289-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between these related enzyme families is quite limited despite the overall structural similarities; however, many of the functional active site amino acids are conserved between these enzyme families (16Goward C.R. Nicholls D.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that these enzymes are functionally related, several of the active site amino acids in the lactate dehydrogenase framework have been altered to the corresponding malate dehydrogenase residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Replacement of the glutamine 102 of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with an arginine resulted in the reversal of specificity, with the conversion of LDH to an eMDH with high specificity for oxaloacetate (17Wilks H.M. Hart K.W. Feeney R.E. Dunn C.R. Muirhead H. Chia W.N. Barstow D.A. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Science. 1988; 242: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The corresponding replacement in eMDH resulted in an enzyme with broader specificity, but does not lead to a reversal of specificity (1Nicholls D.J. Miller J. Scawen M.D. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Atkinson T. Goward C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutagenic replacements at several additional active site functional groups have confirmed the more stringent substrate specificity of eMDH over LDH (3Boernke W.E. Millard C.S. Stevens P.W. Kakar S.N. Stevens F.J. Donnelly M.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Malate dehydrogenase is quite specific for the oxidation ofl-malate and the reduction of OAA. No activity is observed with the 3-carbon keto acid analog pyruvate, and the activity with the 5-carbon analog α-ketoglutarate is diminished by nearly 10,000-fold when compared with the physiological substrate. The introduction of a hydroxyl or a phenyl group in place of the β-carboxyl group of OAA does allow the enzyme-catalyzed reduction of these analogs, but with significantly decreasedk cat/K m values that are comparable to those observed with α-ketoglutarate. One of the goals of this chemical modulation approach is to introduce new catalytic activities into existing enzymes. Re-designing the active site of eMDH will require an examination of each of the putative substrate binding groups. Replacement of arginine 81, a group proposed to interact in a bidentate fashion with the substrate (Fig. 1), with several unnatural alkyl and aryl groups has resulted in the alteration of the specificity of eMDH (14Wright S.K. Kish M.M. Viola R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31689-31694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The introduction of a benzyl group at this position leads to a 10-fold decrease in thek cat/K m for OAA, and a corresponding 10-fold increase for phenylpyruvate as a substrate. Thek cat values for these substrates have actually been reversed for this benzyl-modified enzyme, with thek cat for phenylpyruvate now 8 times greater than that for OAA and within a factor of 2 of thek cat for OAA with native eMDH (14Wright S.K. Kish M.M. Viola R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31689-31694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The arginine at position 153 was selected as the next target for modification because there appears, from an assessment of the high resolution structure, to be fewer direct interactions to the 1-carboxylate of the bound substrate than to the 4-carboxyl group. Removal of arginine 153 from malate dehydrogenase results in a greater than 10-fold decrease in catalytic activity. This loss of activity reflects the need for the placement of a binding group to correctly orient the substrate by interacting with the 1-carboxyl group. When the interaction of this mutant enzyme was examined with a variety of substrate structural analogs, some interesting binding patterns emerged. Replacement of arginine 153 with cysteine leads to a loss in binding affinity for pyruvate and lactate, the 3-carbon analogs of the physiological substrates that are missing the 4-carboxyl group. However, the increases in K i values are surprisingly modest when considering that, for these analogs, the electrostatic interactions at both the 1-carboxyl end, by removal of arginine 153, and at the 4-carboxyl end, by elimination of the 4-carboxyl group, have been disrupted. These results clearly point to the presence of significant additional interactions between the enzyme and its keto or hydroxyacid substrate. The introduction of a positive or a polar functional group at position 153 is sufficient to restore binding of these 3-carbon analogs to near native levels. However, alterations in the identity of the functionality at this position have little effect on the binding of the 5-carbon analogs α- and β-ketoglutarate (Table II). The introduction of an amidine at this position does lead to a nearly 4-fold increase in the binding of β-ketoglutarate compared with that of the native enzyme. The decrease of one bond length in the side chain of the R153C-AAn enzyme, compared with the native enzyme, is apparently compensated for by the one carbon shift in the position of the carbonyl group in β-ketoglutarate. This shift would preserve the positioning in the active site of the carbonyl carbon that is the site of reduction. In contrast, the incorporation of a comparably positioned amide at position 153 results in decreased affinity for these substrate analogs. These results indicate the preference for a positively charged functional group at this position to form an electrostatic interaction with the substrate 1-carboxyl group. The introduction of a negatively charged functional group at position 153 would be expected to disrupt the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate. The binding of the 5-carbon ketoglutarate analogs are weaker with the R153C-Ac enzyme than with any other modified enzyme that has been examined (Table II). These are not large effects but, even if fully extended, the introduced carboxyl group in R153C-Ac would still not be within Van der Waals contact of these substrates. Modeling studies suggest that the potential charge repulsion between the substrate carboxyl group and the carboxyl group introduced at position 153 could be avoided by a rotation of the side chain into an alternative conformation (18Bell J.K. Yennawar H.P. Wright S.K. Thompson J.R. Viola R.E. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31156-31162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The introduction of a variety of arginine analogs has led to an enhancement of the R153C mutant enzyme's capability to bind its substrates and competitive inhibitors. In a number of cases (shown in bold in Table II), these introduced functional groups have resulted in improved affinity when compared with the native enzyme. Although similar variations are observed in catalytic activity among the modified enzymes, in no case does the activity exceed or even approach that of the native enzyme. The best recovery of activity was observed with the propylamine-modified enzyme, and even here k catfor malate is less than 20% and for OAA is about 30% of the native enzyme. These results clearly show that more stringent requirements must be met beyond the recovery of reasonable binding affinity in order to achieve enhanced catalysis. For almost all of these modified enzymes, there is little difference between the decreases in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme that are observed under saturating substrate conditions (k cat) and under limiting substrate conditions (k cat/K m). Binding of the substrate at the enzyme active site is a necessary requirement for catalysis. However, efficient catalysis also requires precise positioning of the substrate in close proximity to the enzyme catalytic group and to the coenzyme for effective hydride transfer. These studies suggest that the primary role of the individual arginines at the active site of eMDH is not in substrate binding, but in substrate orientation.

All nascent Rab proteins are prenylated by geranylgeranyltransferase II, which recognizes the Rab substrate only when it is bound to Rab escort protein (REP). After prenylation, REP remains associated with the modified Rab until it is delivered to the appropriate subcellular membrane. It remains unclear whether docking of the Rab with the correct membrane is solely a function of features contained within the prenylated Rab itself (with REP serving as a “passive” carrier) or whether REP actively participates in the targeting process. To address this issue, we took advantage of a mutation in the α2 helix of Rab1B (i.e. Y78D) that abolishes REP and GDI interaction without disrupting nucleotide binding or hydrolysis. These studies demonstrate that replacing the C-terminal GGCC residues of Rab1B(Y78D) with a CLLL motif permits this protein to be prenylated by geranylgeranyltransferase I but not II both in cell-free enzyme assays and in transfected cells.

Rab1A and Rab1B are two of the most extensively studied members of the Rab family. Both proteins are found in membranes of the ER,1 Golgi apparatus and intermediate vesicles between these compartments (4Plutner H. Cox A.D. Pind S. Khosravi-Far R. Bourne J. Schwaninger R. Der C.J.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), Rab proteins cycle on and off donor and acceptor membranes in a guanine nucleotide-dependent fashion. In the GDP-bound form, which is presumed to represent the inactive state, the Rab proteins are typically associated with an accessory protein, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), in the cytosol. Upon delivery to the membrane, interaction with an exchange factor promotes substitution of GTP for GDP, placing the Rab protein in the active conformation (10Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The activated Rab protein then facilitates the targeting of a budding transport vesicle to the correct acceptor membrane by mediating vesicle-N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (v-SNARE) interactions with the corresponding target-SNARE (t-SNARE) (11Lupashin V.V. Waters M.G. Science. 1997; 276: 1255-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 12Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1212-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). At the acceptor membrane, the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rab protein may be stimulated by interaction with a GTPase-activating protein, returning it to the GDP-bound conformation. In this form, the Rab protein can be removed from the membrane by GDI, completing the cycle. All Rab proteins are modified post-translationally by 1 or 2 20-carbon geranylgeranyl groups that are linked covalently to cysteine residues at their C termini. This isoprenoid modification (prenylation) is necessary for two facets of Rab function. First, it is required for association of the GTPase with the membrane (13Khosravi-Far R. Lutz R.J. Cox A.D. Conroy L. Bourne J.R. Sinensky M. Balch W.E. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6264-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Overmeyer J.H. Maltese W.A. J. Biol.

Prenylation of Rab proteins is catalyzed by geranylgeranyltransferase type II (GGTase II) (17Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

GGTase II will prenylate the target cysteine residues only if the nascent Rab substrate is first bound to a carrier protein termed Rab escort protein (REP) (19Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S.

After the prenyl groups are added to the C terminus of the Rab protein, GGTase II is released, whereas REP remains bound to the prenylated protein and delivers it to the membrane. Chavrier et al. (22Chavrier P. Gorvel J.-P. Stelzer E. Simons K. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. Nature. 1991; 353: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) used chimeric proteins to show that the hypervariable domain near the C terminus of each Rab protein contains information required for targeting to a specific subcellular membrane compartment. However, the precise role of the chaperone (i.e. REP) in this process has yet to be defined. One possibility is that REP acts cooperatively with the Rab protein to promote association with a specific docking complex at the target membrane. An alternative possibility is that REP is a passive carrier that does not interact directly with putative Rab-docking complexes at the acceptor membrane. In the present study we explore the role of REP in the membrane targeting of Rab1B, taking advantage of our previous observations that amino acid substitutions within the Rab1B α2-helix (e.g. Tyr-78 → Asp) completely prevent association with REP (23Overmeyer J.H. Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). By changing the two C-terminal cysteine residues of Rab1B(Y78D) to a CLLL motif, we were able to convert the protein to a substrate for geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase I), which can modify monomeric GTPases in the absence of REP. Despite its inability to associate with REP or GDI, the Rab1B(Y78D)CLLL construct was delivered to ER membranes. However, when a dominant-negative mutation was introduced into the same protein, it failed to suppress ER → Golgi transport. Thus, although membrane targeting of Rab1B can occur in the absence of REP, it appears that protein interactions mediated either directly by the Rab1B α2 helical domain or indirectly by formation of the REP·Rab1B complex are essential for functional association of Rab1B with the vesicular transport machinery. cDNAs encoding MycRab1B(ΔCC), which lacks the two terminal cysteine residues, MycRab1B(wt) and MycRab1B(Y78D), were generated as described previously (23Overmeyer J.H.

J. 1996; 318: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Two additional constructs involving an amino acid substitution (S22N) or replacement of the two C-terminal cysteine residues with CLLL were created by polymerase chain reaction modification of the rab1B cDNA using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and appropriate oligonucleotide primers. The cDNAs were subcloned into pCMV5 (25Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for expression in mammalian cell lines and into pET17b (Novagen, Madison, WI) for expression in Escherichia coli. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by dye-terminator cycle sequencing using an ABI 377 DNA Sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Several of the constructs were subsequently subcloned into a pCMV5 vector that had been modified by polymerase chain reaction to encode an in-frame HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) instead of the Myc tag at the N terminus of the expressed protein. Vectors encoding T7 epitope-tagged REP (pCMVREP1) and FLAG-tagged GDIα (pCMVGDIα) were generated as described previously (23Overmeyer J.H. Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10932-10940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant MycRab1B proteins was induced in E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS, and bacterial lysates were prepared as described previously (26Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10932-10940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Total protein was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211784) Google Scholar), and the relative amount of each MycRab1B protein in each bacterial lysate was determined by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody (9E10) against the Myc epitope, as described previously (24Wilson A.L. Sheridan K.M. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The abilities of different Rab1B constructs to serve as substrates for GGTase II were compared by adding aliquots of bacterial lysate containing equal amounts of Rab protein to a 50-μl reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm Nonidet P-40, 1 μCi of [3H]GGPP, 20 ng of recombinant REP, 20 ng of recombinant GGTase II. Prenylation of the bacterially expressed Rab proteins by GGTase I was determined in a 50- μl reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 20 mm KCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 25 μm ZnCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Zwittergent 3–14, 1 μCi of [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and 10 ng of purified GGTase I. The reactions were stopped after 90 min at 37 °C by the addition of 1× SDS sample buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205478) Google Scholar). Three quarters of each assay sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography to determine incorporation of [3H]geranylgeranyl moiety into the recombinant Rab protein. The remainder of each sample was subjected to immunoblot analysis to confirm equal protein loading in the assays. Cells expressing various MycRab1B constructs were harvested from 100-mm dishes 24 h after transfection. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was homogenized in 80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 5.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, and Complete Mini-EDTA-Free protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.2 rotor. The supernatant and particulate fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the Myc epitope (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was used to detect the epitope-tagged Rab proteins, with goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody. Quantification of the signal produced by Pierce SuperSignal reagents was performed on a LumiImager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HEK293 cells or NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with pCMV vectors containing the indicated Rab constructs using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One hour after transfection, the cells were changed to medium containing 10 μm lovastatin and 200 μCi of [3H]mevalonolactone (Mev) (2.95 Ci/mmol) with or without 10 μm GGTI-298, a specific inhibitor of GGTase I (provided by S. Sebti, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa FL) (29Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar). After 18 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and disrupted in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 20 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.75% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Particulate material was removed by centrifugation of the lysates at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the epitope-tagged Rab proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the Myc epitope for 2 h. Immune complexes were collected by a 1-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads coupled to goat anti-mouse IgG. The beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, then the Myc-tagged Rab proteins were eluted in immunoprecipitation sample buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.0% SDS, 30.0% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue). One-tenth of each immunoprecipitate was subjected to immunoblot analysis to compare the recoveries of different Rab constructs, whereas the remainder of the sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography to measure [3H]Mev incorporation. To determine the subcellular distribution of the prenylated Rab proteins, the metabolic labeling, as described above, was started 3 h after transfection, and cells from three 100-mm dishes were pooled. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C to obtain cytosol and membrane-enriched fractions. The Myc-tagged Rab proteins were then immunoprecipitated from each fraction and analyzed as described above. Starting 3 h after transfection, cells were switched to methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 40 μCi/mll-[methyl-3H]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated at 37 °C. After 18 h, the cells were harvested and lysed as described in the preceding section. One-tenth of the cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis to confirm MycRab1B expression. The Myc-tagged Rab proteins were immunoprecipitated from the remaining cell lysate as described above. After SDS-PAGE and fluorography, the dried gel was cut into 0.5-cm sections, and the amount of [3H]methanol released by alkaline hydrolysis of protein O-methyl esters in each gel slice was determined as described by Clarke et al.(30Clarke S. Vogel J.P. Deschenes R.J. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4643-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a vector encoding T7-tagged REP-1 (pCMVREP1) and different Myc-tagged Rab1B constructs. After transfection, cells were maintained in medium containing an inhibitor of isoprenoid synthesis (10 μm lovastatin) to prevent prenylation and promote the accumulation of nascent Rab·REP complexes. After 48 h, cells from 2 parallel 100-mm cultures were pooled, and cytosolic fractions were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose-12 column, essentially as described by Overmeyer et al. (23Overmeyer J.H. Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The elution positions of the T7-REP and MycRab1B were determined by immunoblot analysis of the column fractions using antibodies against the epitope tags. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a pCMV vector encoding FLAG-tagged GDIα and the specified Myc-tagged Rab1B. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells from a 100-mm culture were harvested, and soluble fractions were prepared as described (26Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10932-10940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One-tenth of this fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis to check for expression of FLAG-GDI and MycRab1B. The remaining sample was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG affinity beads to detect Rab proteins bound to FLAG-GDIα, as described in detail by Wilson et al. (26Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10932-10940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes containing laminin-coated coverslips and were transfected with the specified vectors. Approximately 24 h later, the coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol for 15 min or fixed with cold 3.0% paraformaldehyde then permeabilized by incubation for 2 min with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. Mouse or rabbit antibodies against the Myc epitope were used to detect the Rab1B constructs. Where indicated, the cells were co-incubated with a monoclonal antibody against GM130 (1:25 dilution) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), a polyclonal antibody against Rab6 (1:200 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or a polyclonal antibody against calreticulin (1:150 dilution) (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) were used at a 1:100 dilution as the secondary antibodies. Photomicrographs were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescent microscope equipped with a digital camera. Pseudo-coloring and merging of images were performed with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Cultured 293 cells were co-transfected with pLDLR17, which encodes the human LDL receptor (31Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and each of the indicated pCMVRab1B constructs. Twenty-four hours later, cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with 100 μCi of [35S]Easy-Tag Express™ protein-labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 1.0 ml of methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) followed by a 2-h chase in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 200 μm methionine and 200 μm cysteine. Cells from parallel cultures were harvested immediately after the pulse or after the 2-h chase, and the radiolabeled LDL receptor was immunoprecipitated as described by Castellano et al. (32Castellano F.C. Wilson A.L. Maltese W.A. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Mutations in the predicted α2 helix in the Switch-2 domain of Rab1B (e.g. Tyr- 78 → Asp) disrupt the ability of the GTPase to interact with REP, without impairing GTP binding or hydrolysis (23Overmeyer J.H. Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Consequently the same mutations prevent REP-dependent prenylation of Rab proteins by GGTase II (23Overmeyer J.H. Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Castellano F. Maltese W.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that an α2 helix mutant might be used to determine whether or not REP is required for the delivery of Rab1B to intracellular membranes, provided that the GTPase could be prenylated by an alternate REP-independent mechanism. To achieve this goal, we took advantage of our previous finding that Rab8, which ends with a C-terminal CAAL 2CAAL represents a cysteine residue followed by two aliphatic amino acids and a terminal leucine residue. prenylation motif similar to that in the Rac and Rho GTPases, can be modified either by the REP-dependent GGTase II or by the REP-independent GGTase I, which does not require the formation of a REP·Rab complex (33Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Castellano F. Maltese W.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Hence, the two C-terminal cysteine residues of Rab1B(wt) and Rab1B(Y78D) were replaced with CLLL to form a GGTase I recognition motif (34Kinsella B.T. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cell-free assays were used to compare the prenylation of the various recombinant Rab1B proteins by GGTase Iversus GGTase II. As seen in Fig.1, Rab1B(wt), which ends with a CC motif, is a substrate only for GGTase II. The addition of the CLLL motif to the C terminus of this protein permits it to be prenylated by either GGTase I or GGTase II. Separate studies in which REP was omitted from the reaction mixture showed that prenylation of Rab1B(wt) or Rab1B-CLLL by GGTase II was entirely dependent on the presence of the escort protein (data not shown). On the other hand, the addition of REP to the GGTase I reaction neither permitted prenylation of Rab1B(wt) nor enhanced prenylation of Rab1B-CLLL by GGTase I (data not shown). Most importantly, the studies in Fig. 1 show that by substituting the normal CC motif with CLLL, the REP binding-deficient Rab1B(Y78D) mutant could be prenylated in a REP-independent manner by GGTase I. To verify that the results of the cell-free assays accurately predicted the ability of the C-terminal CC → CLLL substitution to permit prenylation of the Rab1B(Y78D) mutant in intact cells, Myc-tagged Rab1B constructs were overexpressed in 3T3 cells, and the relative incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into immunoprecipitated proteins was compared (Fig.2). Mevalonate is an isoprenoid precursor that is incorporated into the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate substrate used by either GGTase I or GGTase II. Incorporation of this precursor was measured in the presence and absence of GGTI-298, a specific inhibitor of GGTase I (29Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar). Several general conclusions can be drawn from the results. First, when both GGTase I and GGTase II were active (no inhibitor), Rab1B(Y78D) with the normal CC motif was not labeled by [3H]Mev, whereas the same protein with the added CLLL motif was clearly prenylated. Second, the prenylation of Rab1B(Y78D)CLLL was completely prevented by the inhibitor, GGTI-298. Taken together, these results confirm that the modification of Rab1B(Y78D)CLLL in vivo is catalyzed by GGTase I, as indicated by the cell-free assay (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, the wild-type Rab1B-CLLL, which has only a single cysteine available for modification, showed a greater incorporation of [3H]Mev per unit protein than the wild-type Rab1B with the original CC motif. However, it is important to bear in mind that this type of study does not provide a stoichiometric analysis of prenylation, because overexpression results in the accumulation of a large pool of non-prenylated Rab1B in the transfected cells (26Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10932-10940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased incorporation of [3H]Mev into Rab1B-CLLL, compared with Rab1B, may reflect the fact that two different GGTase enzyme systems are able to prenylate the Rab1B-CLLL, whereas only the REP/GGTase II system can prenylate Rab1B with the CC ending. The absence of prenylation of Rab1B(Y78D)CLLL by REP/GGTase II in the cell-free assay (Fig. 1) suggested that the addition of CLLL motif to the Y78D mutant allowed prenylation by GGTase I but did not restore REP binding. This was confirmed in intact cells, where the CLLL versions of Myc-tagged Rab1B(wt) or Y78D were co-expressed with T7-tagged REP1. As shown in Fig. 3, size-exclusion chromatography of cytosol obtained from cells expressing MycRab1B-CLLL revealed a typical high molecular weight Rab·REP complex, similar to that previously reported for MycRab1B(wt) (23Overmeyer J.H. Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, MycRab1B(Y78D)CLLL was unable to form a stable complex with T7-REP1, consistent with our earlier observations with MycRab1B(Y78D) containing the normal double-cysteine motif (23Overmeyer J.H. Wilson A.L. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of REP and GDI reveal four major conserved regions between these two proteins (36Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), consistent with some functional similarities. Both proteins associate with prenylated Rab proteins in the GDP-bound conformation and can deliver them to membranes (10Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol.
