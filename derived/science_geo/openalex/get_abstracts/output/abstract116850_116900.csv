https://openalex.org/W2022098233,"A new mathematical model was used to analyze a detailed set of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) viral load data collected from five infected individuals after the administration of a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Productively infected cells were estimated to have, on average, a life-span of 2.2 days (half-life t 1/2 = 1.6 days), and plasma virions were estimated to have a mean life-span of 0.3 days (t 1/2 = 0.24 days). The estimated average total HIV-1 production was 10.3 x 10(9) virions per day, which is substantially greater than previous minimum estimates. The results also suggest that the minimum duration of the HIV-1 life cycle in vivo is 1.2 days on average, and that the average HIV-1 generation time--defined as the time from release of a virion until it infects another cell and causes the release of a new generation of viral particles--is 2.6 days. These findings on viral dynamics provide not only a kinetic picture of HIV-1 pathogenesis, but also theoretical principles to guide the development of treatment strategies."

https://openalex.org/W1999952815,"We report the cloning of a transcription-associated histone acetyltransferase type A (HAT A). This Tetrahymena enzyme is strikingly homologous to the yeast protein Gcn5, a putative transcriptional adaptor, and we demonstrate that recombinant Gcn5p possesses HAT activity. Both the ciliate enzyme and Gcn5p contain potential active site residues found in other acetyltransferases and a highly conserved bromodomain. The presence of this domain in nuclear A-type HATs, but not in cytoplasmic B-type HATs, suggests a mechanism whereby HAT A is directed to chromatin to facilitate transcriptional activation. These findings shed light on the biochemical function of the evolutionarily conserved Gcn5p–Ada complex, directly linking histone acetylation to gene activation, and indicate that histone acetylation is a targeted phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2024923170,"The highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed 14-3-3 family of proteins bind to a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. The nature and specificity of 14-3-3 binding is, however, not known. Here we show that 14-3-3 is a specific phosphoserine-binding protein. Using a panel of phosphorylated peptides based on Raf-1, we have defined the 14-3-3 binding motif and show that most of the known 14-3-3 binding proteins contain the motif. Peptides containing the motif could disrupt 14-3-3 complexes and inhibit maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes. These results suggest that the interactions of 14-3-3 with signaling proteins are critical for the activation of signaling proteins. Our findings also suggest novel roles for serine/threonine phosphorylation in the assembly of protein-protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1980587508,"Mathematical models, which are based on a firm understanding of biological interactions, can provide nonintuitive insights into the dynamics of host responses to infectious agents and can suggest new avenues for experimentation. Here, a simple mathematical approach is developed to explore the relation between antiviral immune responses, virus load, and virus diversity. The model results are compared to data on cytotoxic T cell responses and viral diversity in infections with the human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)."
https://openalex.org/W2060029591,"Endochondral ossification is a major mode of bone formation that occurs as chondrocytes undergo proliferation, hypertrophy, cell death, and osteoblastic replacement. We have identified a role for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) in this process by disrupting the murine Fgfr-3 gene to produce severe and progressive bone dysplasia with enhanced and prolonged endochondral bone growth. This growth is accompanied by expansion of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes within the cartilaginous growth plate. Thus, FGFR-3 appears to regulate endochondral ossification by an essentially negative mechanism, limiting rather than promoting osteogenesis. In light of these mouse results, certain human disorders, such as achondroplasia, can be interpreted as gain-of-function mutations that activate the fundamentally negative growth control exerted by the FGFR-3 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2062205148,"Signal-induced activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB requires specific phosphorylation of the inhibitor IkappaBalpha and its subsequent proteolytic degradation. Phosphorylation of serine residues 32 and 36 targets IkappaBalpha to the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway. Here we report the identification of a large, multisubunit kinase (molecular mass approximately 700 kDa) that phosphorylates IkappaBalpha at S32 and S36. Remarkably, the activity of this kinase requires the Ub-activating enzyme (E1), a specific Ub carrier protein (E2) of the Ubc4/Ubc5 family, and Ub. We also show that a ubiquitination event in the kinase complex is a prerequisite for specific phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. Thus, ubiquitination serves a novel regulatory function that does not involve proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2089938437,"The pleiotropic biological activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) are mediated by its type I receptor (IL-1RI). When the ligand binds, IL-1RI initiates a signaling cascade that results in the activation of the transcription regulator nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). A protein kinase designated IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) was purified, and its complementary DNA was molecularly cloned. When human embryonic kidney cells (cell line 293) over-expressing IL-1RI or HeLa cells were exposed to IL-1, IRAK rapidly associated with the IL-1RI complex and was phosphorylated. The primary amino acid sequence of IRAK shares similarity with that of Pelle, a protein kinase that is essential for the activation of a NF-kappa B homolog in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2001553481,"We report the first identification of a cellular receptor mediating entry of a gram-positive bacterium into nonphagocytotic cells. By an affinity chromatography approach, we identified E-cadherin as the ligand for internalin, an L. monocytogenes protein essential for entry into epithelial cells. Expression of the chicken homolog of E-cadherin (L-CAM) in transfected fibroblasts dramatically increases entry of L. monocytogenes and promotes that of a recombinant L. innocua strain expressing internalin but does not promote entry of the wild-type noninvasive L. innocua or that of an internalin-deficient mutant of L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, L-CAM-specific antibodies block internalin-mediated entry. In contrast to Salmonella, Listeria enters cells by a mechanism of induced phagocytosis occurring without membrane ruffling. This work reveals a novel type of heterophilic interactions for E-cadherin."

https://openalex.org/W1990876250,"The rotavirus nonstructural glycoprotein NSP4 is an intracellular receptor that mediates the acquisition of a transient membrane envelope as subviral particles bud into the endoplasmic reticulum. NSP4 also causes an increase in intracellular calcium in insect cells. Purified NSP4 or a peptide corresponding to NSP4 residues 114 to 135 induced diarrhea in young (6 to 10 days old) CD1 mice. This disease response was age-dependent, dose-dependent, and specific. Electrophysiologic data from intestinal mucosa showed that the NSP4 114-135 peptide potentiates chloride secretion by a calcium-dependent signaling pathway. Diarrhea is induced when NSP4, acting as a viral enterotoxin, triggers a signal transduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2005806732,"Iron must cross biological membranes to reach essential intracellular enzymes. Two proteins in the plasma membrane of yeast--a multicopper oxidase, encoded by the FET3 gene, and a permease, encoded by the FTR1 gene--were shown to mediate high-affinity iron uptake. FET3 expression was required for FTR1 protein to be transported to the plasma membrane. FTR1 expression was required for apo-FET3 protein to be loaded with copper and thus acquire oxidase activity. FTR1 protein also played a direct role in iron transport. Mutations in a conserved sequence motif of FTR1 specifically blocked iron transport."
https://openalex.org/W2078909808,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that invades a wide range of vertebrate host cells. We demonstrate that invasion is critically dependent on actin filaments in the parasite, but not the host cell. Invasion into cytochalasin D (CD)-resistant host cells was blocked by CD, while parasite mutants invaded wild-type host cells in the presence of drug. CD resistance in Toxoplasma was mediated by a point mutation in the single-copy actin gene ACT1. Transfection of the mutant act1 allele into wild-type Toxoplasma conferred motility and invasion in the presence of CD. We conclude that host cell invasion by Toxoplasma, and likely by related Apicomplexans, is actively powered by an actin-based contractile system in the parasite."

https://openalex.org/W1999383552,"Multivalent binding proteins, such as the yeast scaffold protein Sterile-5, coordinate the location of kinases by serving as platforms for the assembly of signaling units. Similarly, in mammalian cells the cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatase 2B [calcineurin (CaN)] are complexed by an A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Deletion analysis and binding studies demonstrate that a third enzyme, protein kinase C (PKC), binds AKAP79 at a site distinct from those bound by PKA or CaN. The subcellular distributions of PKC and AKAP79 were similar in neurons. Thus, AKAP79 appears to function as a scaffold protein for three multifunctional enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2148211715,"Olfactory signaling is initiated by interactions between odorants and olfactory receptors. We show that the C. elegans odr-10 gene is likely to encode a receptor for the odorant diacetyl. odr-10 mutants have a specific defect in chemotaxis to diacetyl, one of several odorants detected by the AWA olfactory neurons. odr-10 encodes a predicted seven transmembrane domain receptor; a green fluorescent protein-tagged Odr-10 protein is localized to the AWA sensory cilia. odr-10 expression is regulated by odr-7, a transcription factor implicated in AWA sensory specification. Expression of odr-10 from a heterologous promoter directs behavioral responses to diacetyl, but not to another odorant detected by the AWA neurons. These results provide functional evidence for a specific interaction between an olfactory receptor protein and its odorant ligand."

https://openalex.org/W2077707065,"Activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system is known to trigger relapse in animal models of cocaine-seeking behavior. We found that this ""priming"" effect was selectively induced by D2-like, and not by D1-like, dopamine receptor agonists in rats. Moreover, D1-like receptor agonists prevented cocaine-seeking behavior induced by cocaine itself, whereas D2-like receptor agonists enhanced this behavior. These results demonstrate an important dissociation between D1- and D2-like receptor processes in cocaine-seeking behavior and support further evaluation of D1-like receptor agonists as a possible pharmacotherapy for cocaine addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2016767717,"Rotaviruses are the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis and dehydrating diarrhea in young children and animals worldwide. A murine model and “backpack tumor” transplantation were used to determine the protective effect of antibodies against VP4 (an outer capsid viral protein) and VP6 (a major inner capsid viral protein). Only two non-neutralizing immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies to VP6 were capable of preventing primary and resolving chronic murine rotavirus infections. These antibodies were not active, however, when presented directly to the luminal side of the intestinal tract. These findings support the hypothesis that in vivo intracellular viral inactivation by secretory IgA during transcytosis is a mechanism of host defense against rotavirus infection."

https://openalex.org/W1965386059,"For the last 20 years, it has been hypothesized that well-coordinated, multijoint movements are executed without complex computation by the brain, with the use of springlike muscle properties and peripheral neural feedback loops. However, it has been technically and conceptually difficult to examine this ""equilibrium-point control"" hypothesis directly in physiological or behavioral experiments. A high-performance manipulandum was developed and used here to measure human arm stiffness, the magnitude of which during multijoint movement is important for this hypothesis. Here, the equilibrium-point trajectory was estimated from the measured stiffness, the actual trajectory, and the generated torque. Its velocity profile differed from that of the actual trajectory. These results argue against the hypothesis that the brain sends as a motor command only an equilibrium-point trajectory similar to the actual trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W1992516996,"Spiders produce a variety of silks that range from Lycra-like elastic fibers to Kevlar-like superfibers. A gene family from the spider Araneus diadematus was found to encode silk-forming proteins (fibroins) with different proportions of amorphous glycine-rich domains and crystal domains built from poly(alanine) and poly(glycine-alanine) repeat motifs. Spiders produce silks of different composition by gland-specific expression of this gene family, which allows for a range of mechanical properties according to the crystal-forming potential of the constituent fibroins. These principles of fiber property control may be important in the development of genetically engineered structural proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1987046764,"Human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) replicates actively in infected individuals, yet cells with intracellular depots of viral protein are observed only infrequently. Many cells expressing the HIV-1 Gag protein were detected at the surface of the nasopharyngeal tonsil or adenoid. This infected mucosal surface contained T cells and dendritic cells, two cell types that together support HIV-1 replication in culture. The infected cells were multinucleated syncytia and expressed the S100 and p55 dendritic cell markers. Eleven of the 13 specimens analyzed were from donors who did not have symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The interaction of dendritic cells and T cells in mucosa may support HIV-1 replication, even in subclinical stages of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2011603540,"Rapid photochemical electron injection into unfolded ferricytochrome c titrated with 2.3 to 4.6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCL) at pH 7 and 40 degrees C produced unfolded ferrocytochrome, which then converted to the folded protein. Two folding phases were observed: a fast process with a time constant of 40 microseconds (4.6 M GuHCL), and a slower phase with a rate constant of 90 +/- 20 per second (2.3 M GuHCL). The activation free energy for the slow step varied linearly with GuHCL concentration; the rate constant, extrapolated to aqueous solution, was 7600 per second. Electron-transfer methods can bridge the nanosecond to millisecond measurement time gap for protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W2057347947,"The crystal structure of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I has been determined in the autoinhibited form. The C-terminal regulatory region of the enzyme forms a helix-loop-helix segment that extends across the two domains of the catalytic core, making multiple inhibitory interactions. Elements of the first regulatory alpha helix and the loop interfere with the binding site for peptide substrates, while the loop and the second helix interact with the ATP-binding domain to induce conformational changes that obstruct the nucleotide binding pocket. One part of the calmodulin recognition element protrudes away from the catalytic domain and is potentially available for an initial interaction with calmodulin. The structure provides a view of an intact calmodulin target and suggests that substantial structural changes will accompany kinase activation by calmodulin binding to the regulatory region."
https://openalex.org/W2027121633,"In the first step of V(D)J recombination, the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins cleave DNA between a signal sequence and the adjacent coding sequence, generating a blunt signal end and a coding end with a closed hairpin structure. These hairpins are intermediates leading to the formation of assembled antigen receptor genes. It is shown here that the hairpins are formed by a chemical mechanism of direct trans-esterification, very similar to the early steps of transpositional recombination and retroviral integration. A minor variation in the reaction is sufficient to divert the process from transposition to hairpin formation."
https://openalex.org/W2062660708,"Budding of enveloped viruses from cellular membranes is believed to depend on the presence of transmembrane spike proteins interacting with cytoplasmic virus components. To address the mechanism of rhabdovirus budding, we generated rabies virus mutants deficient for the glycoprotein G or the G cytoplasmic tail. We found that spikeless rhabdovirus particles were released from cells infected with the G-deficient mutant, demonstrating that a viral surface protein is not required to drive the budding process. However, particle production is enhanced approximately 6-fold and 30-fold in the presence of tailless G or G, respectively. This reveals that G also possesses an intrinsic and independent exocytosis activity. We propose a model according to which efficient budding of rhabdoviruses is achieved by a concerted action of both core and spike proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2017766716,"Low-barrier or short, strong hydrogen bonds have been proposed to contribute 10 to 20 kilocalories per mole to transition-state stabilization in enzymatic catalysis. The proposal invokes a large increase in hydrogen bond energy when the pKa values of the donor and acceptor (where Ka is the acid constant) become matched in the transition state (delta pKa=0). This hypothesis was tested by investigating the energetics of hydrogen bonds as a function of delta pKa for homologous series of compounds under nonaqueous conditions that are conducive to the formation of low-barrier hydrogen bonds. In all cases, there was a linear correlation between the increase in hydrogen-bond energy and the decrease in delta pKa, as expected from simple electrostatic effects. However, no additional energetic contribution to the hydrogen bond was observed at delta pKa=0. These results and those of other model studies suggest alternative mechanisms by which hydrogen bonds can contribute to enzymatic catalysis, in accord with conventional electrostatic considerations."
https://openalex.org/W1991437670,"Human foamy virus (HFV) is the prototype of the Spumavirus genus of Retroviridae. In all other retroviruses, the pol gene products, including reverse transcriptase, are synthesized as Gag-Pol fusion proteins and are cleaved to functional enzymes during viral budding or release. In contrast, the Pol protein of HFV is translated from a spliced messenger RNA and lacks Gag domains. Infectious HFV particles contain double-stranded DNA similar in size to full-length provirus, suggesting that reverse transcription has taken place in viral particles before new rounds of infection, reminiscent of hepadnaviruses. These data suggest that foamy viruses possess a replication pathway containing features of both retroviruses and hepadnaviruses but distinct from both."
https://openalex.org/W2098941196,"Cyclins regulate the major cell cycle transitions in eukaryotes through association with cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs). In yeast, G1 cyclins are essential, rate-limiting activators of cell cycle initiation. G1-specific accumulation of one G1 cyclin, Cln2, results from periodic gene expression coupled with rapid protein turnover. Site-directed mutagenesis of CLN2 revealed that its phosphorylation provides a signal that promotes rapid degradation. Cln2 phosphorylation is dependent on the Cdc28 protein kinase, the CDK that it activates. These findings suggest that Cln2 is rendered self-limiting by virtue of its ability to activate its cognate CDK subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2127248667,"The 2.6 Angstrom crystal structure for human cyclin-dependent kinase 2(CDK2) in complex with CksHs1, a human homolog of essential yeast cell cycle-regulatory proteins suc1 and Cks1, reveals that CksHs1 binds via all four beta strands to the kinase C-terminal lobe. This interface is biologically critical, based upon mutational analysis, but far from the CDK2 N-terminal lobe, cyclin, and regulatory phosphorylation sites. CDK2 binds the Cks single domain conformation and interacts with conserved hydrophobic residues plus His-60 and Glu-63 in their closed beta-hinge motif conformation. The beta hinge opening to form the Cks beta-interchanged dimer sterically precludes CDK2 binding, providing a possible mechanism regulating CDK2-Cks interactions. One face of the complex exposes the sequence-conserved phosphate-binding region on Cks and the ATP-binding site on CDK2, suggesting that CKs may target CDK2 to other phosphoproteins during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1985829181,"Researchers interested in high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have long sought higher magnetic fields to enhance resolution and simplify spectra. Magnets with substantially larger fields than those available in the best commercial spectrometers are available, but the inhomogeneity is unacceptable for high-resolution spectra. A detection method (termed HOMOGENIZED) is presented that removes inhomogeneity while retaining chemical shift differences and J couplings. With existing inhomogeneous magnets, this method could nearly double the largest resonance frequency available for high-resolution NMR. The HOMOGENIZED sequence is based on observations of intermolecular zero-quantum coherences between a solute molecule and solvent molecules that are micrometers away; as long as the field is homogeneous over this short distance, sharp resonances are recovered without echoes. Experimental demonstrations and a detailed density matrix theory to explain the effect are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2027197247,"Diffusible factors of several protein families control appendage outgrowth and patterning in both insects and vertebrates. In Drosophila wing development, the gene decapentaplegic (dpp) is expressed along the anteroposterior compartment boundary. Early wingless (wg) expression is involved in setting up the dorsoventral boundary. Interaction between dpp- and wg-expressing cells promotes appendage outgrowth. Here, it is shown that optomotor-blind (omb) expression is required for distal wing development and is controlled by both dpp and wg. Ectopic omb expression can lead to the growth of additional wings. Thus, omb is essential for wing development and is controlled by two signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2046703384,"Deletion of uridylates from the 3′-most editing site of synthetic ATPase 6 pre-mRNA can be visualized directly by coincubation of a radiolabeled substrate RNA and a synthetic gRNA in 20S fractions of T. brucei mitochondrial lysates. Substrate RNA cleavage is gRNA directed and occurs 3′ to the uridylates to be deleted. U residues appear to be sequentially removed from the 3′ end of the 5′ cleavage product prior to religation of the two pre-mRNA halves. gRNA/mRNA chimeric molecules are also produced. Time course experiments indicate that chimeras appear after cleavage intermediates and edited product. Furthermore, a mutant gRNA promotes formation of edited product but not detectable chimeras. Our results suggest a model for kinetoplastid RNA editing in which chimeric molecules are nonproductive end products of editing and not intermediates that serve as a repository for deleted U's."

https://openalex.org/W2086774854,"The nuclear import factor p10 was cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found to be essential. The protein p10 can bind directly to several peptide repeat-containing nucleoporins. It also binds to the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ran in its guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound form and to karyopherin β. Assembly of the karyopherin heterodimer on immobilized nucleoporin yielded cooperative binding of p10 and Ran-GDP. Addition of GTP to this pentameric complex led to dissociation of karyopherin α, presumably via in situ formation of Ran-GTP from Ran-GDP. Thus, p10 appears to coordinate the Ran-dependent association and dissociation reactions underlying nuclear import."

https://openalex.org/W2065943770,"DNA-binding E2F complexes have been identified throughout the mammalian cell cycle, including the transcriptionally inactive complexes with pocket proteins, which occur early in the prereplicative G1 phase of the cycle, and the transactivating free E2F, which increases in late G1. Here, a regulatory B-myb promoter site was shown to bind with high affinity to free E2F and to E2F-pocket protein complexes in an indistinguishable way in vitro. In contrast, in vivo footprinting with NIH 3T3 cells demonstrated E2F site occupation specifically in early G1, when the B-myb promoter is inactive. These observations indicate that a novel mechanism governs E2F-DNA interactions during the cell cycle and emphasize the relevance of E2F site-directed transcriptional repression."

https://openalex.org/W2054981017,"Although certain replication errors occur at different frequencies on each of the complementary strands of DNA, it remains unclear whether this bias is prevalent enough during chromosome replication to affect sequence evolution. Here, nucleotide substitutions in enteric bacteria were examined, and no difference in mutation rates was detected between the leading and lagging strands, but in comparing the coding and noncoding strands, an excess of C→T changes was observed on the coding strand. This asymmetry is best explained by transcription-coupled repair on the noncoding strand. Although the vast majority of mutations are thought to arise from spontaneous errors during replication, this result implicates DNA damage as a substantial source of mutations in the wild."
