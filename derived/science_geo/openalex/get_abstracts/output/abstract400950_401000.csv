https://openalex.org/W2067841051,"Mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis has a key role in the regulation of aerobic metabolism and cell survival, but the molecular identity of the Ca(2+) channel, the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, is still unknown. Here we have identified in silico a protein (named MCU) that shares tissue distribution with MICU1 (also known as CBARA1), a recently characterized uniporter regulator, is present in organisms in which mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake was demonstrated and whose sequence includes two transmembrane domains. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of MCU in HeLa cells markedly reduced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake. MCU overexpression doubled the matrix Ca(2+) concentration increase evoked by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonists, thus significantly buffering the cytosolic elevation. The purified MCU protein showed channel activity in planar lipid bilayers, with electrophysiological properties and inhibitor sensitivity of the uniporter. A mutant MCU, in which two negatively charged residues of the putative pore-forming region were replaced, had no channel activity and reduced agonist-dependent matrix Ca(2+) concentration transients when overexpressed in HeLa cells. Overall, these data demonstrate that the 40-kDa protein identified is the channel responsible for ruthenium-red-sensitive mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, thus providing a molecular basis for this process of utmost physiological and pathological relevance."
https://openalex.org/W1986213783,"Mitochondria from diverse organisms are capable of transporting large amounts of Ca(2+) via a ruthenium-red-sensitive, membrane-potential-dependent mechanism called the uniporter. Although the uniporter's biophysical properties have been studied extensively, its molecular composition remains elusive. We recently used comparative proteomics to identify MICU1 (also known as CBARA1), an EF-hand-containing protein that serves as a putative regulator of the uniporter. Here, we use whole-genome phylogenetic profiling, genome-wide RNA co-expression analysis and organelle-wide protein coexpression analysis to predict proteins functionally related to MICU1. All three methods converge on a novel predicted transmembrane protein, CCDC109A, that we now call 'mitochondrial calcium uniporter' (MCU). MCU forms oligomers in the mitochondrial inner membrane, physically interacts with MICU1, and resides within a large molecular weight complex. Silencing MCU in cultured cells or in vivo in mouse liver severely abrogates mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, whereas mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential remain fully intact. MCU has two predicted transmembrane helices, which are separated by a highly conserved linker facing the intermembrane space. Acidic residues in this linker are required for its full activity. However, an S259A point mutation retains function but confers resistance to Ru360, the most potent inhibitor of the uniporter. Our genomic, physiological, biochemical and pharmacological data firmly establish MCU as an essential component of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter."
https://openalex.org/W2125397535,"Mammalian genomes are viewed as functional organizations that orchestrate spatial and temporal gene regulation. CTCF, the most characterized insulator-binding protein, has been implicated as a key genome organizer. However, little is known about CTCF-associated higher-order chromatin structures at a global scale. Here we applied chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag (ChIA-PET) sequencing to elucidate the CTCF-chromatin interactome in pluripotent cells. From this analysis, we identified 1,480 cis- and 336 trans-interacting loci with high reproducibility and precision. Associating these chromatin interaction loci with their underlying epigenetic states, promoter activities, enhancer binding and nuclear lamina occupancy, we uncovered five distinct chromatin domains that suggest potential new models of CTCF function in chromatin organization and transcriptional control. Specifically, CTCF interactions demarcate chromatin-nuclear membrane attachments and influence proper gene expression through extensive cross-talk between promoters and regulatory elements. This highly complex nuclear organization offers insights toward the unifying principles that govern genome plasticity and function."
https://openalex.org/W1985075809,"High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin is a widely used therapeutic preparation of highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. It is administered at high doses (1-2 grams per kilogram) for the suppression of autoantibody-triggered inflammation in a variety of clinical settings. This anti-inflammatory activity of intravenous immunoglobulin is triggered by a minor population of IgG crystallizable fragments (Fcs), with glycans terminating in α2,6 sialic acids (sFc) that target myeloid regulatory cells expressing the lectin dendritic-cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; also known as CD209). Here, to characterize this response in detail, we generated humanized DC-SIGN mice (hDC-SIGN), and demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory activity of intravenous immunoglobulin can be recapitulated by the transfer of bone-marrow-derived sFc-treated hDC-SIGN(+) macrophages or dendritic cells into naive recipients. Furthermore, sFc administration results in the production of IL-33, which, in turn, induces expansion of IL-4-producing basophils that promote increased expression of the inhibitory Fc receptor FcγRIIB on effector macrophages. Systemic administration of the T(H)2 cytokines IL-33 or IL-4 upregulates FcγRIIB on macrophages, and suppresses serum-induced arthritis. Consistent with these results, transfer of IL-33-treated basophils suppressed induced arthritic inflammation. This novel DC-SIGN-T(H)2 pathway initiated by an endogenous ligand, sFc, provides an intrinsic mechanism for maintaining immune homeostasis that could be manipulated to provide therapeutic benefit in autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2002511118,"The self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells is enhanced by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3). β-catenin is now found to be necessary for this effect through its interaction with Tcf3 to abrogate its repressive action for the expression of genes from the core pluripotency network. Self-renewal of rodent embryonic stem cells is enhanced by partial inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3; refs 1, 2). This effect has variously been attributed to stimulation of Wnt signalling by β-catenin1, stabilization of Myc protein3 and global de-inhibition of anabolic processes4. Here we demonstrate that β-catenin is not necessary for embryonic stem cell identity or expansion, but its absence eliminates the self-renewal response to Gsk3 inhibition. Responsiveness is fully restored by truncated β-catenin lacking the carboxy-terminal transactivation domain5. However, requirement for Gsk3 inhibition is dictated by expression of T-cell factor 3 (Tcf3) and mediated by direct interaction with β-catenin. Tcf3 localizes to many pluripotency genes6 in embryonic stem cells. Our findings confirm that Tcf3 acts as a transcriptional repressor and reveal that β-catenin directly abrogates Tcf3 function. We conclude that Gsk3 inhibition stabilizes the embryonic stem cell state primarily by reducing repressive influence on the core pluripotency network."

https://openalex.org/W2083935868,"The co-occupancy of Tcf3 with Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog on embryonic stem cell (ESC) chromatin indicated that Tcf3 has been suggested to play an integral role in a poorly understood mechanism underlying Wnt-dependent stimulation of mouse ESC self-renewal of mouse ESCs. Although the conventional view of Tcf proteins as the β-catenin-binding effectors of Wnt signalling suggested Tcf3-β-catenin activation of target genes would stimulate self-renewal, here we show that an antagonistic relationship between Wnt3a and Tcf3 on gene expression regulates ESC self-renewal. Genetic ablation of Tcf3 replaced the requirement for exogenous Wnt3a or GSK3 inhibition for ESC self-renewal, demonstrating that inhibition of Tcf3 repressor is the necessary downstream effect of Wnt signalling. Interestingly, both Tcf3-β-catenin and Tcf1-β-catenin interactions contributed to Wnt stimulation of self-renewal and gene expression, and the combination of Tcf3 and Tcf1 recruited Wnt-stabilized β-catenin to Oct4 binding sites on ESC chromatin. This work elucidates the molecular link between the effects of Wnt and the regulation of the Oct4/Sox2/Nanog network."
https://openalex.org/W2015316095,"Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that has a major role in the function of the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cell. Parasympathetic innervation of the endocrine pancreas, the islets of Langerhans, has been shown to provide cholinergic input to the beta cell in several species, but the role of autonomic innervation in human beta cell function is at present unclear. Here we show that, in contrast to the case in mouse islets, cholinergic innervation of human islets is sparse. Instead, we find that the alpha cells of human islets provide paracrine cholinergic input to surrounding endocrine cells. Human alpha cells express the vesicular acetylcholine transporter and release acetylcholine when stimulated with kainate or a lowering in glucose concentration. Acetylcholine secretion by alpha cells in turn sensitizes the beta cell response to increases in glucose concentration. Our results demonstrate that in human islets acetylcholine is a paracrine signal that primes the beta cell to respond optimally to subsequent increases in glucose concentration. Cholinergic signaling within islets represents a potential therapeutic target in diabetes, highlighting the relevance of this advance to future drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2041472984,"Canonical Wnt signalling has been implicated in mouse and human embryonic stem cell (ESC) maintenance; however, its requirement is controversial. β-catenin is the key component in this highly conserved Wnt pathway, acting as a transcriptional transactivator. However, β-catenin has additional roles at the plasma membrane regulating cell-cell adhesion, complicating the analyses of cells/tissues lacking β-catenin. We report here the generation of a Ctnnb1 (β-catenin)-deficient mouse ESC (mESC) line and show that self-renewal is maintained in the absence of β-catenin. Cell adhesion is partially rescued by plakoglobin upregulation, but fails to be maintained during differentiation. When differentiated as aggregates, wild-type mESCs form descendants of all three germ layers, whereas mesendodermal germ layer formation and neuronal differentiation are defective in Ctnnb1-deficient mESCs. A Tcf/Lef-signalling-defective β-catenin variant, which re-establishes cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, rescues definitive endoderm and neuroepithelial formation, indicating that the β-catenin cell-adhesion function is more important than its signalling function for these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2083857067,"Aversive olfactory memory is formed in the mushroom bodies in Drosophila melanogaster. Memory retrieval requires mushroom body output, but the manner in which a memory trace in the mushroom body drives conditioned avoidance of a learned odor remains unknown. To identify neurons that are involved in olfactory memory retrieval, we performed an anatomical and functional screen of defined sets of mushroom body output neurons. We found that MB-V2 neurons were essential for retrieval of both short- and long-lasting memory, but not for memory formation or memory consolidation. MB-V2 neurons are cholinergic efferent neurons that project from the mushroom body vertical lobes to the middle superiormedial protocerebrum and the lateral horn. Notably, the odor response of MB-V2 neurons was modified after conditioning. As the lateral horn has been implicated in innate responses to repellent odorants, we propose that MB-V2 neurons recruit the olfactory pathway involved in innate odor avoidance during memory retrieval."
https://openalex.org/W1998357223,"Stefan Somlo and colleagues show that the polycystic liver disease genes Prkcsh and Sec63 are required for the proper biogenesis of polycystin complexes. They further show that a Pkd1 transgene can rescue the cystic phenotype of Prkcsh and Sec63 mutant mice, identifying polycystin-1 as the central determinant of cyst formation. Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease results from mutations in PRKCSH or SEC63. The respective gene products, glucosidase IIβ and SEC63p, function in protein translocation and quality control pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we show that glucosidase IIβ and Sec63p are required in mice for adequate expression of a functional complex of the polycystic kidney disease gene products, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2. We find that polycystin-1 is the rate-limiting component of this complex and that there is a dose-response relationship between cystic dilation and levels of functional polycystin-1 following mutation of Prkcsh or Sec63. Reduced expression of polycystin-1 also serves to sensitize the kidney to cyst formation resulting from mutations in Pkhd1, the recessive polycystic kidney disease gene. Finally, we show that proteasome inhibition increases steady-state levels of polycystin-1 in cells lacking glucosidase IIβ and that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor reduces cystic disease in orthologous gene models of human autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W1985908128,"MicroRNAs are often associated with the pathogenesis of many cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In particular, microRNA-21 (miR-21) appears to have a critical role in tumor cell survival, chemoresistance and HNSCC progression. In this study, we investigated matrix hyaluronan (HA)-induced CD44 (a primary HA receptor) interaction with the stem cell markers, Nanog and Stat-3, in HNSCC cells (HSC-3 cells). Our results indicate that HA binding to CD44 promotes Nanog–Stat-3 (also tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3) complex formation, nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. Further analyses reveal that miR-21 is controlled by an upstream promoter containing Stat-3 binding site(s), while chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that stimulation of miR-21 expression by HA/CD44 signaling is Nanog/Stat-3-dependent in HNSCC cells. This process results in a decrease of a tumor suppressor protein (PDCD4), and an upregulation of i nhibitors of the apoptosis family of proteins (IAPs) as well as chemoresistance in HSC-3 cells. Treatment of HSC-3 cells with Nanog- and/or Stat-3-specific small interfering RNAs effectively blocks HA-mediated Nanog–Stat-3 signaling events, abrogates miR-21 production and increases PDCD4 expression. Subsequently, this Nanog–Stat-3 signaling inhibition causes downregulation of survival protein (IAP) expression and enhancement of chemosensitivity. To further evaluate the role of miR-21 in tumor cell-specific functions, HSC-3 cells were also transfected with a specific anti-miR-21 inhibitor in order to silence miR-21 expression and block its target functions. Our results demonstrate that anti-miR-21 inhibitor not only upregulates PDCD4 expression but also decreases IAP expression and enhances chemosensitivity in HA-treated HNSCC cells. Together, these findings indicate that the HA-induced CD44 interaction with Nanog and Stat-3 has a pivotal role in miR-21 production leading to PDCD4 reduction, IAP upregulation and chemoresistance in HNSCC cells. This novel Nanog/Stat-3 signaling pathway-specific mechanism involved in miR-21 production is significant for the formation of future intervention strategies in the treatment of HA/CD44-activated HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W1999769013,"The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is upregulated and has an oncogenic role in several types of human cancer. However, the abnormalities of EZH2 and its underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain unknown. In this study, we found that high expression of EZH2 in NPC was associated closely with an aggressive and/or poor prognostic phenotype (P<0.05). In NPC cell lines, knockdown of EZH2 by short hairpin RNA was sufficient to inhibit cell invasiveness/metastasis both in vitro and in vivo, whereas ectopic overexpression of EZH2 supported NPC cell invasive capacity with a decreased expression of E-cadherin. In addition, ablation of endogenous Snail in NPC cells virtually totally prevented the repressive activity of EZH2 to E-cadherin, indicating that Snail might be a predominant mediator of EZH2 to suppress E-cadherin. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (IP), chromatin IP and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that in NPC cells, (1) EZH2 interacted with HDAC1/HDAC2 and Snail to form a repressive complex; (2) these components interact in a linear fashion, not in a triangular fashion, that is, HDAC1 or HDAC2 bridge the interaction between EZH2 and Snail; and (3) the EZH2/HDAC1/2/Snail complex could closely bind to the E-cadherin promoter by Snail, but not YY1, to repress E-cadherin. The data provided in this report suggest a critical role of EZH2 in the control of cell invasion and/or metastasis by forming a co-repressor complex with HDAC1/HDAC2/Snail to repress E-cadherin, an activity that might be responsible, at least in part, for the development and/or progression of human NPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2128926964,"Changes in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i levels control critical cytosolic and nuclear events that are involved in the initiation and progression of tumor angiogenesis in endothelial cells (ECs). Therefore, the mechanism(s) involved in agonist-induced Ca2+i signaling is a potentially important molecular target for controlling angiogenesis and tumor growth. Several studies have shown that blood vessels in tumors differ from normal vessels in their morphology, blood flow and permeability. We had previously reported a key role for arachidonic acid (AA)-mediated Ca2+ entry in the initial stages of tumor angiogenesis in vitro. In this study we assessed the mechanism involved in AA-induced EC migration. We report that TRPV4, an AA-activated channel, is differentially expressed in EC derived from human breast carcinomas (BTEC) as compared with ‘normal’ EC (HMVEC). BTEC display a significant increase in TRPV4 expression, which was correlated with greater Ca2+ entry, induced by AA or 4αPDD (a selective TRPV4 agonist) in the tumor-derived ECs. Wound-healing assays revealed a key role of TRPV4 in regulating cell migration of BTEC but not HMVEC. Knockdown of TRPV4 expression completely abolished AA-induced BTEC migration, suggesting that TRPV4 mediates the pro-angiogenic effects promoted by AA. Furthermore, pre-incubation of BTEC with AA induced actin remodeling and a subsequent increase in the surface expression of TRPV4. This was consistent with the increased plasma membrane localization of TRPV4 and higher AA-stimulated Ca2+ entry in the migrating cells. Together, the data presented herein demonstrate that: (1) TRPV4 is differentially expressed in tumor-derived versus ‘normal’ EC; (2) TRPV4 has a critical role in the migration of tumor-derived but not ‘normal’ EC migration; and (3) AA induces actin remodeling in BTEC, resulting in a corresponding increase of TRPV4 expression in the plasma membrane. We suggest that the latter is critical for migration of EC and thus in promoting angiogenesis and tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2024230071,"Fascin is the main actin filament bundling protein in filopodia. Because of the important role filopodia play in cell migration, fascin is emerging as a major target for cancer drug discovery. However, an understanding of the mechanism of bundle formation by fascin is critically lacking. Fascin consists of four β-trefoil domains. Here, we show that fascin contains two major actin-binding sites, coinciding with regions of high sequence conservation in β-trefoil domains 1 and 3. The site in β-trefoil-1 is located near the binding site of the fascin inhibitor macroketone and comprises residue Ser-39, whose phosphorylation by protein kinase C down-regulates actin bundling and formation of filopodia. The site in β-trefoil-3 is related by pseudo-2-fold symmetry to that in β-trefoil-1. The two sites are ∼5 nm apart, resulting in a distance between actin filaments in the bundle of ∼8.1 nm. Residue mutations in both sites disrupt bundle formation in vitro as assessed by co-sedimentation with actin and electron microscopy and severely impair formation of filopodia in cells as determined by rescue experiments in fascin-depleted cells. Mutations of other areas of the fascin surface also affect actin bundling and formation of filopodia albeit to a lesser extent, suggesting that, in addition to the two major actin-binding sites, fascin makes secondary contacts with other filaments in the bundle. In a high resolution crystal structure of fascin, molecules of glycerol and polyethylene glycol are bound in pockets located within the two major actin-binding sites. These molecules could guide the rational design of new anticancer fascin inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2033602611,"Activation of Notch signaling by Jagged-1 (Jag-1) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) promotes a differentiated phenotype characterized by increased expression of contractile proteins. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miR)-143/145 regulates VSMC phenotype. The serum response factor (SRF)/myocardin complex binds to CArG sequences to activate miR-143/145 transcription, but no other regulators are known in VSMC. Using miR arrays, we found miR-143/145 induced following expression of a constitutively active Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD). We hypothesized that miR-143/145 is required for Jag-1/Notch-induced VSMC differentiation. Activation of Notch receptors by Jag-1 caused CBF1-dependent up-regulation of miR-143/145, increased differentiation, and decreased proliferation. Conversely, inhibiting basal Notch signaling decreased steady state levels of miR-143/145. Using SRF knockdown, we found that Jag-1/Notch induction of miR-143/145 is SRF independent, although full acquisition of contractile markers requires SRF. Using miR-143/145 promoter reporter constructs we show Jag-1/Notch increases promoter activity, and this is dependent on intact CBF1 consensus sites within the promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that N1ICD-containing complexes bind to CBF1 sites in the miR-143/145 promoter. We also identified N1ICD complex binding to CBF1 sites within the endogenous human miR-143/145 promoter. Using miR-143/145-interfering oligonucleotides, we demonstrate that Jag-1/Notch signaling requires induction of both miR-143 and miR-145 to promote the VSMC contractile phenotype. Thus, miR-143/145 is a novel transcriptional target of Jag-1/Notch signaling in VSMC. We propose miR-143/145 as activated independently by Jag-1/Notch and SRF in parallel pathways. Multiple pathways converging on miR-143/145 provides potential for fine-tuning or amplification of VSMC differentiation signals."

Glial myoglianin upregulated neuronal expression of an ecdysone nuclear receptor that triggered neurite remodeling following the late-larval ecdysone peak.

https://openalex.org/W2146854566,"Bmi1 is a key stem cell regulatory gene implicated in the pathogenesis of many aggressive cancers, including medulloblastoma. Overexpression of Bmi1 promotes cell proliferation and is required for hedgehog (Hh) pathway-driven tumorigenesis. This study aimed to determine if Sonic hedgehog (Shh) modulates the key stem cell regulatory gene Bmi1 in childhood medulloblastoma brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs). Although current literature suggests that there is a correlation between Shh pathway genes and Bmi1 expression, it is unclear whether there is indeed a direct regulatory mechanism. To address whether Shh induces expression of Bmi1, stem cell-enriched populations from medulloblastoma cell lines and primary samples were treated with Shh ligand and KAAD-cyclopamine (Shh antagonist). Our data indicate that Bmi1 expression positively correlates with increasing Shh ligand concentrations. Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that Gli1 preferentially binds to the Bmi1 promoter, and Bmi1 transcript levels are increased and decreased by Gli1 overexpression and downregulation, respectively. Knockdown experiments of Bmi1 in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that Hh signaling not only drives Bmi1 expression, but a feedback mechanism exists wherein downstream effectors of Bmi1 may, in turn, activate Hh pathway genes. These findings implicate Bmi1 and Hh as mutually indispensable pathways in medulloblastoma BTIC maintenance. Recent molecular characterization of medulloblastoma also reveals that Bmi1 is overexpressed across all subgroups of medulloblastoma, particularly in the most aggressive subtypes. Lastly, despite recent identification of BTIC markers, the molecular characterization of these cell populations remains unclear. In this work, we propose that the BTIC marker CD133 may segregate a cell population with a Hh-receptor phenotype, thus demonstrating a cell-cell interaction between the CD133+ Hh receptor cells and the CD133- Hh-secreting cells."

https://openalex.org/W2124409628,"How animals maintain proper amounts of sleep yet remain flexible to changes in environmental conditions remains unknown. We found that environmental light suppressed the wake-promoting effects of dopamine in fly brains. The ten large lateral-ventral neurons (l-LNvs), a subset of clock neurons, are wake-promoting and respond to dopamine, octopamine and light. Behavioral and imaging analyses suggested that dopamine is a stronger arousal signal than octopamine. Notably, light exposure not only suppressed l-LNv responses, but also synchronized responses of neighboring l-LNvs. This regulation occurred by distinct mechanisms: light-mediated suppression of octopamine responses was regulated by the circadian clock, whereas light regulation of dopamine responses occurred by upregulation of inhibitory dopamine receptors. Plasticity therefore alters the relative importance of diverse cues on the basis of the environmental mix of stimuli. The regulatory mechanisms described here may contribute to the control of sleep stability while still allowing behavioral flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2115955652,"Effective cancer immunotherapy requires the release of a broad spectrum of tumor antigens in the context of potent immune activation. We show here that a cDNA library of normal tissue, expressed from a highly immunogenic viral platform, cures established tumors of the same histological type from which the cDNA library was derived. Immune escape occurred with suboptimal vaccination, but tumor cells that escaped the immune pressure were readily treated by second-line virus-based immunotherapy. This approach has several major advantages. Use of the cDNA library leads to presentation of a broad repertoire of (undefined) tumor-associated antigens, which reduces emergence of treatment-resistant variants and also permits rational, combined-modality approaches in the clinic. Finally, the viral vectors can be delivered systemically, without the need for tumor targeting, and are amenable to clinical-grade production. Therefore, virus-expressed cDNA libraries represent a novel paradigm for cancer treatment addressing many of the key issues that have undermined the efficacy of immuno- and virotherapy to date."
https://openalex.org/W1982632616,"Compounds identified from a high-content screen implicate RTK activation as well as GSK-3 inhibition in regulating SMN levels and point to a therapeutic strategy for treating spinal muscular atrophy. The motor neuron disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) results from mutations that lead to low levels of the ubiquitously expressed protein survival of motor neuron (SMN). An ever-increasing collection of data suggests that therapeutics that elevate SMN may be effective in treating SMA. We executed an image-based screen of annotated chemical libraries and discovered several classes of compounds that were able to increase cellular SMN. Among the most important was the RTK–PI3K–AKT–GSK-3 signaling cascade. Chemical inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) directed against this target elevated SMN levels primarily by stabilizing the protein. It was particularly notable that GSK-3 chemical inhibitors were also effective in motor neurons, not only in elevating SMN levels, but also in blocking the death that was produced when SMN was acutely reduced by an SMN-specific shRNA. Thus, we have established a screen capable of detecting drug-like compounds that correct the main phenotypic change underlying SMA."
https://openalex.org/W2068094128,"Chuvash polycythemia is a rare congenital form of polycythemia caused by homozygous R200W and H191D mutations in the VHL (von Hippel-Lindau) gene, whose gene product is the principal negative regulator of hypoxia-inducible factor. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying some of the hallmark abnormalities of Chuvash polycythemia, such as hypersensitivity to erythropoietin, are unclear. Here we show that VHL directly binds suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) to form a heterodimeric E3 ligase that targets phosphorylated JAK2 (pJAK2) for ubiquitin-mediated destruction. In contrast, Chuvash polycythemia-associated VHL mutants have altered affinity for SOCS1 and do not engage with and degrade pJAK2. Systemic administration of a highly selective JAK2 inhibitor, TG101209, reversed the disease phenotype in Vhl(R200W/R200W) knock-in mice, an experimental model that recapitulates human Chuvash polycythemia. These results show that VHL is a SOCS1-cooperative negative regulator of JAK2 and provide biochemical and preclinical support for JAK2-targeted therapy in individuals with Chuvash polycythemia."
https://openalex.org/W2007045357,"Epigenetic fields for cancerization are involved in development of human cancers, especially those associated with inflammation and multiple occurrences. However, it is still unclear when such field defects are formed and what component of inflammation is involved in induction of aberrant DNA methylation. Here, in a mouse colitis model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), we identified three CpG islands specifically methylated in colonic epithelial cells exposed to colitis. Their methylation levels started to increase as early as 8 weeks after DSS treatment and continued to increase until colon cancers developed at 15 weeks. In contrast to the temporal profile of DNA methylation levels, infiltration of inflammatory cells spiked immediately after the DSS treatment and then gradually decreased. Exposure of cultured colonic epithelial cells to DSS did not induce DNA methylation and it was indicated that inflammation triggered by the DSS treatment was responsible for methylation induction. To clarify components of inflammation involved, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice that lack functional T- and B-cells were similarly treated. Even in SCID mice, DNA methylation, along with colon tumors, were induced at the same levels as in their background strain of mice (C.B17). Comparative analysis of inflammation-related genes showed that Ifng, Il1b and Nos2 had expression concordant with methylation induction whereas Il2, Il6, Il10, Tnf did not. These results showed that an epigenetic field defect is formed at early stages of colitis-associated carcinogenesis and that functional T and B cells are non-essential for the formation."
https://openalex.org/W2045776501,"Aberrant expression of Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC)/osteonectin has been associated with an invasive tumor cell phenotype and poor outcome in human melanomas. Although it is known that SPARC controls melanoma tumorigenesis, the precise role of SPARC in melanoma cell survival is still unclear. Here, we show that SPARC has a cell-autonomous survival activity, which requires Akt-dependent regulation of p53. Suppression of SPARC by RNA interference in several human melanoma cells and xenografted A375 tumors triggers apoptotic cell death through the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway and activation of caspase-3. Cell death induced by depletion of SPARC is dependent on p53 and induction of Bax, and results in the generation of ROS. Stabilization of p53 in SPARC-depleted cells is associated with a decrease in Akt-mediated activating phosphorylation of MDM2. Inhibition of Akt signaling pathway is important for the observed changes as overexpression of constitutively active Akt protects cells against apoptosis induced by SPARC depletion. Conversely, increased expression of SPARC stimulates Akt and MDM2 phosphorylation, thus facilitating p53 degradation. Finally, we show that overexpression of SPARC renders cells more resistant to the p53-mediated cytotoxic effects of the DNA-damaging drug actinomycin-D. Our study indicates that SPARC functions through activation of Akt and MDM2 to limit p53 levels and that acquired expression of SPARC during melanoma development would confer survival advantages through suppression of p53-dependent apoptotic pathways."

Unlike programmed cell death, axon degeneration is poorly understood. We have combined robotic liquid handling with automated microscopy and image analysis to create a robust screening platform to measure axon degeneration in mammalian primary neuronal cultures. Using this assay, we performed an unbiased screen of 480 bioactive compounds, identifying 11 that reproducibly delay fragmentation of severed axons in vitro, including two inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and two inhibitors of IκB kinase. Knockdown of each of these targets by shRNA lentivirus also delays axon degeneration in vitro, further supporting their role in the axon degeneration program."
https://openalex.org/W2075015494,"β-Arrestins 1 and 2 are multifunctional adaptor proteins originally discovered for their role in desensitizing seven-transmembrane receptor signaling via the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. Recently identified roles of β-arrestins include regulation of cancer cell chemotaxis and proliferation. Herein, we report that β-arrestin1 expression regulates breast tumor colonization in nude mice and cancer cell viability during hypoxia. β-Arrestin1 robustly interacts with nuclear hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α) that is stabilized during hypoxia and potentiates HIF-1-dependent transcription of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Increased expression of β-arrestin1 in human breast cancer (infiltrating ductal carcinoma or IDC and metastatic IDC) correlates with increased levels of VEGF-A. While the anti-angiogenic drug thalidomide inhibits HIF-1-dependent VEGF transcription in breast carcinoma cells, it does not prevent HIF-1α stabilization, but leads to aberrant localization of HIF-1α to the perinuclear compartments and surprisingly stimulates nuclear export of β-arrestin1. Additionally, imatinib mesylate that inhibits release of VEGF induces nuclear export of β-arrestin1-HIF-1α complexes. Our findings suggest that β-arrestin1 regulates nuclear signaling during hypoxia to promote survival of breast cancer cells via VEGF signaling and that drugs that induce its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm could be useful in anti-angiogenic and breast cancer therapies."

However, the manner in which NRXN1 gene variation may be related to brain morphology to confer risk for ASD or schizophrenia is unknown. Method/Principal Findings 53 healthy individuals between 18–59 years of age were genotyped at 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the NRXN1 gene. All subjects received structural MRI scans, which were processed to determine cortical gray and white matter lobar volumes, and volumes of striatal and thalamic structures. Each subject's sensorimotor function was also assessed. The general linear model was used to calculate the influence of genetic variation on neural and cognitive phenotypes. Finally, in silico analysis was conducted to assess potential functional relevance of any polymorphisms associated with brain measures. A polymorphism located in the 3′ untranslated region of NRXN1 significantly influenced white matter volumes in whole brain and frontal lobes after correcting for total brain volume, age and multiple comparisons. Follow-up in silico analysis revealed that this SNP is a putative microRNA binding site that may be of functional significance in regulating NRXN1 expression. This variant also influenced sensorimotor performance, a neurocognitive function impaired in both ASD and schizophrenia. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that the NRXN1 gene, a vulnerability gene for SCZ and ASD, influences brain structure and cognitive function susceptible in both disorders. In conjunction with our in silico results, our findings provide evidence for a neural and cognitive susceptibility mechanism by which the NRXN1 gene confers risk for both schizophrenia and ASD."

These complexes are thought to play important roles in modulating class A GPCR function. Many studies suggest that residues located on the “outer” (lipid-facing) surface of the transmembrane (TM) receptor core are critically involved in the formation of class A receptor dimers (oligomers). However, no clear consensus has emerged regarding the identity of the TM helices or TM subsegments involved in this process. To shed light on this issue, we have used the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R), a prototypic class A GPCR, as a model system. Using a comprehensive and unbiased approach, we subjected all outward-facing residues (70 amino acids total) of the TM helical bundle (TM1–7) of the M3R to systematic alanine substitution mutagenesis. We then characterized the resulting mutant receptors in radioligand binding and functional studies and determined their ability to form dimers (oligomers) in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer saturation assays. We found that M3R/M3R interactions are not dependent on the presence of one specific structural motif but involve the outer surfaces of multiple TM subsegments (TM1–5 and -7) located within the central and endofacial portions of the TM receptor core. Moreover, we demonstrated that the outward-facing surfaces of most TM helices play critical roles in proper receptor folding and/or function. Guided by the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer data, molecular modeling studies suggested the existence of multiple dimeric/oligomeric M3R arrangements, which may exist in a dynamic equilibrium.

https://openalex.org/W2073417619,"Human tumors are heterogeneous and evolve through a dynamic process of genetic mutation and selection. During this process, the effects of a specific mutation on the incipient cancer cell may dictate the nature of subsequent mutations that can be tolerated or selected for, affecting the rate at which subsequent mutations occur. Here we have used a new mouse model of prostate cancer that recapitulates several salient features of the human disease to examine the relative rates in which the remaining wild-type alleles of Pten and p53 tumor suppressor genes are lost. In this model, focal overexpression of c-MYC in a few prostate luminal epithelial cells provokes a mild proliferative response. In the context of compound Pten/p53 heterozygosity, c-MYC-initiated cells progress to prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) and adenocarcinoma lesions with marked heterogeneity within the same prostate glands. Using laser capture microdissection and gene copy number analyses, we found that the frequency of Pten loss was significantly higher than that of p53 loss in mPIN but not invasive carcinoma lesions. c-MYC overexpression, unlike Pten loss, did not activate the p53 pathway in transgenic mouse prostate cells, explaining the lack of selective pressure to lose p53 in the c-MYC-overexpressing cells. This model of heterogeneous prostate cancer based on alterations in genes relevant to the human disease may be useful for understanding pathogenesis of the disease and testing new therapeutic agents."

The ciliary protein Cep290 modulates cilia formation and is frequently mutated in syndromic and non-syndromic photoreceptor degeneration. However, the underlying mechanism of associated retinopathy is unclear. Using the Cep290 mutant mouse rd16 (retinal degeneration 16), we show that Cep290-mediated photoreceptor degeneration is associated with aberrant accumulation of its novel interacting partner Rkip (Raf-1 kinase inhibitory protein). This effect is phenocopied by morpholino-mediated depletion of cep290 in zebrafish. We further demonstrate that ectopic accumulation of Rkip leads to defective cilia formation in zebrafish and cultured cells, an effect mediated by its interaction with the ciliary GTPase Rab8A. Our data suggest that Rkip prevents cilia formation and is associated with Cep290-mediated photoreceptor degeneration. Furthermore, our results indicate that preventing accumulation of Rkip could potentially ameliorate such degeneration."

In this report we identify NotchICD as a novel target of phosphorylation by CK2. Using mapping and mutational studies, we identified serine 1901, located in the ankyrin domain of Notch, as the target amino acid. Interestingly, phosphorylation of serine 1901 by CK2 appears to generate a second phosphorylation site at threonine 1898. Furthermore, threonine 1898 phosphorylation only occurs when Notch forms a complex with Mastermind and CSL. Phosphorylation of both threonine 1898 and serine 1901 resulted in decreased binding of the Notch-Mastermind-CSL ternary complex to DNA and consequently lower transcriptional activity. These data indicate that the phosphorylation of serine 1901 and threonine 1898 negatively regulates Notch function by dissociating the complex from DNA.

J., and Servent, D. (2008) Mol.

(2010) Biol. Cell 102, 409-420). To structurally characterize the MT7-hM1 complex, we adopted a strategy combining double mutant cycle experiments and molecular modeling calculations. First, thirty-three ligand-receptor proximities were identified from the analysis of sixty-one double mutant binding affinities. Several toxin residues that are more than 25 Å apart still contact the same residues on the receptor. As a consequence, attempts to satisfy all the restraints by docking the toxin onto a single receptor failed. The toxin was then positioned onto two receptors during five independent flexible docking simulations. The different possible ligand and receptor extracellular loop conformations were described by performing simulations in explicit solvent. All the docking calculations converged to the same conformation of the MT7-hM1 dimer complex, satisfying the experimental restraints and in which (i) the toxin interacts with the extracellular side of the receptor, (ii) the tips of MT7 loops II and III contact one hM1 protomer, whereas the tip of loop I binds to the other protomer, and (iii) the hM1 dimeric interface involves the transmembrane helices TM6 and TM7. These results structurally support the high affinity and selectivity of the MT7-hM1 interaction and highlight the atypical mode of interaction of this allosteric ligand on its G protein-coupled receptor target."
https://openalex.org/W2005853241,"The formation of the bipolar spindle is responsible for accurate chromosomal segregation during mitosis. The dynamic instability of microtubules has an important role in this process, and has been shown to be an effective target for cancer chemotherapy. Several agents that target non-microtubule mitotic proteins, including the motor protein Eg5, Aurora kinases and Polo-like kinases, are currently being developed as chemotherapeutic drugs. However, because the efficacies of these drugs remain elusive, new molecular targets that have essential roles in tumor cells are desired. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that transforming acidic coiled-coil-3 (Tacc3) is a potential target for cancer chemotherapy. Using MRI, we showed that Tacc3 loss led to the regression of mouse thymic lymphoma in vivo, which was accompanied by massive apoptosis. By contrast, normal tissues, including the thymus, showed no overt abnormalities, despite high Tacc3 expression. in vitro analysis indicated that Tacc3 depletion induced multi-polar spindle formation, which led to mitotic arrest, followed by apoptosis. Similar responses have been observed in Burkitt's lymphoma and T-ALL. These results show that Tacc3 is a vulnerable component of the spindle assembly in lymphoma cells and is a promising cancer chemotherapy target."
https://openalex.org/W2002594832,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare disease characterized by congenital defects, progressive bone marrow failure and heightened cancer susceptibility. The FA proteins, BRCA1 and FANCD1/BRCA2 function cooperatively in the FA-BRCA pathway to repair damaged DNA. Activation of the FA-BRCA pathway occurs via the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 and FANCI proteins, targeting these proteins to discrete nuclear foci where they function in DNA repair. The cellular regulation of FANCD2/I monoubiquitination, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we have examined the roles of the p53 tumor suppressor protein, as well as its downstream target, the p21(Cip1/Waf1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in the regulation of the activation of the FA-BRCA pathway. We demonstrate that, in contrast to p53, p21 has a major role in the regulation of the activation of the FA-BRCA pathway: p21 promotes S-phase and DNA damage-inducible FANCD2/I monoubiquitination and nuclear foci formation. Several lines of evidence establish that this effect is not a consequence of a defective G1-S checkpoint or altered cell-cycle progression in the absence of p21. Instead, we demonstrate that p21 is required for the transcriptional repression of the USP1 deubiquitinating enzyme upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents. In the absence of p21, persistent USP1 expression precludes the DNA damage-inducible accumulation of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 and FANCI. Consequently, p21(-/-) cells exhibit increased levels of mitomycin C-inducible complex chromosomal aberrations and elevated γH2AX nuclear foci formation. Our results demonstrate that p21 has a critical role in the regulation of the activation of the FA-BRCA pathway and suggest a broader role for p21 in the orchestration of DNA repair processes following exposure to DNA crosslinking agents."

To gain insights into the consequences of the G402S mutation on structure and function of the channel, we systematically mutated the corresponding Gly-432 of the rabbit channel and applied homology modeling. All mutations of Gly-432 (G432A/M/N/V/W) diminished channel inactivation. Homology modeling revealed that Gly-432 forms part of a highly conserved structure motif (G/A/G/A) of small residues in homologous positions of all four domains (Gly-432 (IS6), Ala-780 (IIS6), Gly-1193 (IIIS6), Ala-1503 (IVS6)). Corresponding mutations in domains II, III, and IV induced, in contrast, parallel shifts of activation and inactivation curves indicating a preserved coupling between both processes. Disruption between coupling of activation and inactivation was specific for mutations of Gly-432 in domain I. Mutations of Gly-432 removed inactivation irrespective of the changes in activation. In all four domains residues G/A/G/A are in close contact with larger bulky amino acids from neighboring S6 helices. These interactions apparently provide adhesion points, thereby tightly sealing the activation gate of Ca(V)1.2 in the closed state. Such a structural hypothesis is supported by changes in activation gating induced by mutations of the G/A/G/A residues. The structural implications for Ca(V)1.2 activation and inactivation gating are discussed."

Mirande M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Artemia (19Brandsma M. Kerjan P. Dijk J. Janssen G.M. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) this extension is not present and ValRS did not copurify with EF1 subunits. This polypeptide extension is also absent from all ValRS sequences deduced from protostome genome sequences known so far, suggesting that the VEGA complex is restricted to deuterostomes. A primitive multisynthetase complex, the EMA complex containing only GluRS(E), MetRS(M), and Arc1p(A), a p43 homolog, was found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Karanasios E. Simos G. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The assembly/disassembly of this complex regulates, in space and in time, the activity of its components (21Golinelli-Cohen M.P. Mirande M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 300: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Frechin M. Kern D. Martin R.P. Becker H.D. Senger B. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).

Several studies have shown that after dissociation from their complexes, some of these components may fulfill another, unrelated function, beyond translation. After MAPK-dependent phosphorylation, LysRS dissociates from MARS, translocates into the nucleus of activated mast cells, and activates the microphthalmia transcription factor (24Yannay-Cohen N. Carmi-Levy I. Kay G. Yang C.M. Han J.M. Kemeny D.M. Kim S. Nechushtan H. Razin E. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 603-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Two kinase-mediated phosphorylations of GluProRS permit its dissociation from MARS and alternative association to the GAIT complex, leading to translational silencing of IFN-γ inducible mRNAs (25Arif A.

Caspase 7-mediated cleavage of the p43 component of MARS during apoptosis (9Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. J. Biol.

Haehnel I. Brett J. Greenberg S. Clauss M. Kayton M. Houck K. Kisiel W. Seljelid R. Burnier J. Stern D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9774-9782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ko Y.G.

Accumulation of the p38 component of MARS in dopaminergic neurons contributes to neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease (28Corti O. Hampe C. Koutnikova H. Darios F. Jacquier S. Prigent A. Robinson J.C. Pradier L. Ruberg M. Mirande M. Hirsch E. Rooney T. Fournier A. Brice A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All these examples show that regulation of the spatio-temporal organization of MARS is a key factor for the regulation of the activity of its components. It was reported that disruption of the complexes is not lethal in human cells in culture (11Kaminska M. Havrylenko S. Decottignies P. Gillet S. Le Maréchal P. Negrutskii B. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6053-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but is lethal in mice (29Kim J.Y. Kang Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim H.J. Ahn Y.H. Park H. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7912-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This suggests that the integrity of the complexes is especially required for homeostasis of multicellular organisms. The lack of in vivo experimental approaches acutely hindered our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The only experimental approach was previously reported in Drosophila (30Cerini C. Semeriva M. Gratecos D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It was shown that overexpression of the repeated motifs that link GluRS and ProRS in Drosophila leads to a sterility of the transgenic flies. To be able to assess the functional role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complexes in a living multicellular organism amenable to experimental approaches, we chose to analyze the subcellular organization of these enzymes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results reveal an unexpected new type of MARS organization in this organism. It shows for the first time that molecular evolution of supramolecular complexes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in metazoans is not a linear process consisting of step by step addition of individual components, but involves several events of gene fusion and fission, and of subtraction of components. To evaluate the role of complex assembly on the capacity of its components to be functional in vivo, we searched for transgenes that could rescue the knockdown of the endogenous copy of an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase by RNAi. Our results highlight the prominent role of eukaryotic polypeptide extensions and complex formation on the ability of the component enzymes to be functional in vivo. Worms were maintained using standard techniques (31Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C. elegans isolate N2 Bristol was used as the wild-type. VC1640 (dcap-1&Y55F3AM.13(ok2139)) was from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center stock collection (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN). For large scale C. elegans cultures, nematodes were grown in 50–100-ml aliquots of liquid culture comprised of S-medium (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 10 mm potassium citrate, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 1% trace metal solution (5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm FeSO4, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm ZnCl2, 0.1 mm CuSO4), and 5 μg/ml of cholesterol) supplemented with 50 μg/ml of streptomycin, 5 μg/ml of nystatin, and Escherichia coli HB101 bacteria, at 20 °C with constant shaking at 180 rpm. The culture was started by adding eggs issued of hypochlorite-NaOH-treated adults, resulting in a synchronized population of worms. Integrated transgenic lines used in this study (supplemental Table S1) were generated by microparticle bombardment of unc119(ed3) as described previously (32Praitis V. Casey E. Collar D. Austin J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for one bombardment, 1 μg of linearized plasmid DNA was precipitated onto 0.6 mg of 1.0-μm gold beads (Bio-Rad) with 1.5 m CaCl2 and 20 mm spermidine, washed twice with 70% ethanol, resuspended in 10 μl of ethanol, and spread on a macrocarrier. About 100,000 synchronized unc119(ed3) young adults were spotted in the center of a 100-mm NGM plate. Bombardment was carried out using Bio-Rad Biolistic PDS-1000/HE with 9-mm macrocarrier to screen distance, 28 inches of mercury vacuum, and 1350 p.s.i. rupture discs. Stopping screen to target distance was 6 cm. Worms were allowed to recover 1 to 2 h, washed from the plate, and spread on four 100-mm NGM plates seeded with a lawn of OP50 E. coli. 10–14 days later, plates with starved progeny were checked for the presence of unc119(+) worms with wild-type phenotype. Transgenic nematodes were singled out and their progeny scored for the non-Unc phenotype to determine the rate of transgene transmission. Transgenes were scored as “integrated” for strains that segregated 100% wild-type progeny for at least five generations. Several independent cell lines were obtained, and expression of transgenic proteins was checked by Western blotting. Standard feeding techniques were used (33Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Methods. 2003; 30: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Briefly, synchronized worms were placed onto isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-containing NGM plates seeded with bacteria E. coli HT115(DE3) carrying an RNAi feeding vector. Feeding was carried out at 15 °C. Two protocols were used: L4 feeding (starting RNAi feeding with synchronized L4 worms) or L1 feeding (starting with eggs issued of bleached adults). Phenotypes were scored both in P0 (sterility) and F1 (embryonic lethality, growth). Bacteria harboring the empty L4440 vector (34Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene. 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) served as a control bacteria. The RNAi clone JA:F58B3.5 (WBRNAi00008897) from the J. Ahringer library, designated here as “CAT,” was used to study mrs-1 loss-of-function phenotype. It corresponds to IV:11634533–11635723 nucleotides of genomic DNA complementary to 1–826 nucleotides of mrs-1 mRNA. To probe the complementation capacity of transgenic MetRS recombinant proteins, the following RNAi vectors were constructed (supplemental Table S1). Nucleotides encoding the C-terminal appended domain of MetRS-Ce (C, 1876–2769 nucleotide of mrs-1 mRNA), the N-terminal part of the C-terminal domain (NC, 1876–2265 nucleotides of mrs-1 mRNA), or the C-terminal part of the C-terminal domain (CC, 2278–2769 nucleotides of mrs-1 mRNA) were PCR amplified and cloned into the XhoI-NheI sites of the L4440 plasmid. The L1 feeding protocol was used for complementation assays. To create expression vectors for the construction of transgenic lines, pSB_GW::TAG destination vector was used (gift of J. Reboul). It contains unc119(+) selection marker and attR sites for Gateway cloning (35Polanowska J. Martin J.S. Fisher R. Scopa T. Rae I. Boulton S.J. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 778-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first set of expression vectors (pSB_PRS-Ce_TAP and pSB_MRSΔC-Ce) was prepared using homologous promoters (corresponding to 1716 and 1076 nucleotides upstream of prs-1 and mrs-1 coding regions, respectively) (supplemental Table S1). DNA fragments containing the genes of interest (including the promoter and the coding regions) were PCR amplified from genomic DNA using attB-tailed oligonucleotides. For MetRSΔC-Ce, sequences encoding residues 1–595 were used. The PCR products were inserted into the pDONR201 donor vector with BP clonase (Invitrogen), and nucleotide sequences were verified. In the case of pSB_PRS-Ce_TAP, the entry clone was recombined with pSB_GW::TAP by the LR reaction, resulting in a C-terminal tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged protein, containing protein A and calmodulin-binding protein domains. pSB_GW::TAP was generated by insertion in the unique NgoMIV site of pSB_GW::TAG of the TAP cassette described previously (36Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). In the case of pSB_MRSΔC-Ce, a sequence coding for the HA peptide was included in the oligonucleotide used for PCR amplification, resulting in a C-terminal HA-tagged protein. Because the expression level of MetRSΔC-Ce placed under control of its own mrs-1 promoter was poor in transgenic worms, as compared with endogenous MetRS-Ce, transgenes were placed under control of the eft-3 promoter. A second set of transgenes expressing MetRS recombinant proteins (pSB_eMRSΔC-Ce, pSB_eMRSΔCC-Ce:Cp43, pSB_eMRSΔNC-Ce:Np43, and pSB_eMRSΔNΔCHs:C-Ce) was constructed using eft-3 promoter (described in Ref. 37Hunt-Newbury R.

PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e237Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding core human MetRS (MetRSΔNΔC-Hs, from residues 215 to 823), or fragments of human p43 (Np43, from residues 1 to 144; Cp43, from residues 147 to 312) were obtained by PCR amplification. The eft-3 promoter sequence was PCR-amplified from C. elegans genomic DNA using oligonucleotides Pe003 (5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTGTAAGCCGGCCAGACGGTGA) and P102 (5′-TCCGCCAAGTCGTGACCCATGGCTGCTACGGAGTGAGCAAAGTGT). Nucleotide sequences were verified. Worms were collected by washing NGM plates with M9 buffer (22 mm KH2PO4, 42.5 mm Na2HPO4, 85.5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2), then washing again three times with the same buffer. Typically 2–3 dishes (∅ 60 mm) of a confluent culture of worms were used. Worm pellets were either frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use, or processed immediately for protein extract preparation. SDS extracts were prepared by addition of 2 volumes of SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer containing 8 m urea directly to the worm pellet, boiling for 10 min, and centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The resulting supernatant was used for analysis. Typically ∼20 μg of total protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunopurified polyclonal anti-MetRSΔC-Ce, polyclonal anti-MetRSHsΔNΔC, anti-human Np43 and Cp43 antibodies have been described previously (38Kaminska M. Shalak V. Mirande M.

Monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma. Western blot analyses were conducted with goat anti-rabbit, rabbit anti-goat, or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase (Chemicon) and the ECL detection reagents. Crude extracts were prepared from 0.5-ml worm pellets resuspended in 0.3 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 2 mm PMSF, 5 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml of pepstatin A. After homogenization on ice by 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, the postmitochondrial extract corresponding to the supernatant obtained after centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g was recovered, and 0.5 ml was loaded on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% Tween 20, 2 mm DTT, at 4 °C. Gel filtration was developed at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Elution of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases was monitored by the tRNA aminoacylation assay (41Mirande M. Cirakoğlu B. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Total brewers' yeast tRNA (Roche Applied Science) was used as tRNA substrate, except in the case of AspRS, GluRS, ArgRS, and GlnRS, which were assayed in the presence of partially purified beef liver tRNA. Alternatively, to monitor the elution of MetRS recombinant proteins, fractions (400 μl of fractions) were precipitated by addition of 100 μl of a solution containing 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 0.05% Triton X-100, washed three times with 500 μl of diethyl ether, air-dried, resuspended in the SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Polyclonal, affinity purified antibody directed to MetRSΔC-Ce (40Havrylenko S. Legouis R. Negrutskii B. Mirande M. Protein Sci. 2010; 19: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (GE Healthcare) using 25 mm dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma) in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0). An extract of the C. elegans isolate N2 Bristol was prepared from a 3-ml worm pellet resuspended in 1 volume of IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm DTT) supplemented with Roche Complete mini-tab inhibitors, 2 mm PMSF, 5 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml of pepstatine A, and homogenized using a One Shot Cell Disrupter (Constant Systems, UK) at a working pressure of 1.2 kbar. After centrifugation twice for 15 min at 16,000 × g, supernatant was recovered and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the antibody cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed 7 times with IP buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by incubating the beads for 20 min at 50 °C with 1 bead volume of 2× sample loading buffer without reducing agent. DTT was then added and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. A 50-ml pellet of nematodes, which stably expressed TAP-tagged ProRS-Ce (RD125 strain), was accumulated by growing worms in liquid culture with E. coli HB101 as a food source. For crude extract preparation, the worm pellet was resuspended in 1 volume of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 2 mm PMSF, 5 mm benzamidine) and homogenized using a Basic Z Cell Disrupter (Constant Systems, UK) at a working pressure of 1.2 kbar. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was recovered and filtered through gauze. All subsequent steps of tandem affinity purification were performed as described previously (11Kaminska M. Havrylenko S. Decottignies P. Gillet S. Le Maréchal P. Negrutskii B. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6053-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-PAGE (10 or 12%) and staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 or silver nitrate, gel bands corresponding to each individual protein were excised and digested with trypsin (Gold, Promega) using a Progest robot (Genomic Solutions). The resulting samples were analyzed with the QTOF Premier mass spectrometer coupled to the nanoAcquity liquid chromatography system (Waters). The resulting data files were analyzed using the Mascot program and searching against “all taxa” entries in the nrNCBI data base. Differential interference contrast microscopy was carried out on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus equipped with Nomarski optics (Zeiss). Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop Software. Worms were anesthetized in 10 μm azide. MARS complexes with similar compositions have been isolated from fly to human (7Kerjan P. Cerini C. Sémériva M. Mirande M. Biochim. Biophys.

The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 298-308Google Scholar). These three characteristic features are not equally conserved in C. elegans. Concerning the scaffold protein, a Psi-Blast search (45Schäffer A.A. Aravind L. Madden T.L. Shavirin S. Spouge J.L. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2994-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar) in the C. elegans data library identified the predicted coding sequence of 354 amino acid residues from the Y55F3AM.13 gene product, of unknown function, as the best homologue of human p38 (Fig. 1a). However, the statistical significance was low, with an E value of 4 × 10−4, but conserved residues are evenly distributed throughout the sequence. By comparison, the p38 homologue from Drosophila melanogaster, a species also belonging to the ecdysozoan branch of protostomes, displays an E value of 5 × 10−72. The finding that in nematodes, GluRS and ProRS are not fused, but are carried by distinct polypeptide chains (Fig. 1b) (44Berthonneau E. Mirande M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), also did not argue in favor of the existence of a bona fide MARS complex in this organism. Finally, the characterized PBD appended at the N terminus of human MetRS, a GST-like domain involved in the association of human MetRS to MARS (38Kaminska M. Shalak V. Mirande M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14309-14316Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), is not conserved in nematode MetRS, but a putative PBD is appended near its C terminus (Fig. 1c). This domain is similar to the N-terminal domain of the human p43 component of MARS, which is required for assembly of p43 within the complex (9Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P.

https://openalex.org/W2021467291,"The 3′ regulatory region (3′ RR) of the Igh locus works at long distances on variable region (VH) and switch region (I) region promoters to initiate germ line (non-coding) transcription (GT) and promote class switch recombination (CSR). The 3′ RR contains multiple elements, including enhancers (hs3a, hs1.2, hs3b, and hs4) and a proposed insulator region containing CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) binding sites, i.e. hs5/6/7 and the downstream region (“38”). Notably, deletion of each individual enhancer (hs3a-hs4) has no significant phenotypic consequence, suggesting that the 3′ RR has considerable structural flexibility in its function. To better understand how the 3′ RR functions, we identified transcription factor binding sites and used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to monitor their occupancy in splenic B cells that initiate GT and undergo CSR (LPS±IL4), are deficient in GT and CSR (p50−/−), or do not undergo CSR despite efficient GT (anti-IgM+IL4). Like 3′ RR enhancers, hs5–7 and the 38 region were observed to contain multiple Pax5 binding sites (in addition to multiple CTCF sites). We found that the Pax5 binding profile to the 3′ RR dynamically changed during CSR independent of the specific isotype to which switching was induced, and binding focused on hs1.2, hs4, and hs7.

https://openalex.org/W1968061855,"Ste4 is the β subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein that mediates mating responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we show that Ste4 undergoes ubiquitination in response to pheromone stimulation. Ubiquitination of Ste4 is dependent on the E3 ligase Rsp5. Disrupting the activity of Rsp5 abolishes ubiquitination of Ste4 in vivo, and recombinant Rsp5 is capable of ubiquitinating Ste4 in vitro. We find also that Lys-340 is a major ubiquitination site on Ste4, as pheromone-induced ubiquitination of the protein is prevented when this residue is mutated to an arginine. Functionally, ubiquitination does not appear to regulate the stability of Ste4, as blocking ubiquitination has no apparent effect on either the abundance or the half-life of the protein. However, when presented with a concentration gradient of pheromone, Ste4(K340R) mutant cells polarize significantly faster than wild-type cells, indicating that ubiquitination limits pheromone-directed polarized growth. Together, these findings reveal a novel stimulus-dependent posttranslational modification of a Gβ subunit, establish Ste4 as a new substrate of the E3 ligase Rsp5, and demonstrate a role for G protein ubiquitination in cell polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2045751586,"Housekeeping genes (HKGs) generally have fundamental functions in basic biochemical processes in organisms, and usually have relatively steady expression levels across various tissues. They play an important role in the normalization of microarray technology. Using Fourier analysis we transformed gene expression time-series from a Hela cell cycle gene expression dataset into Fourier spectra, and designed an effective computational method for discriminating between HKGs and non-HKGs using the support vector machine (SVM) supervised learning algorithm which can extract significant features of the spectra, providing a basis for identifying specific gene expression patterns. Using our method we identified 510 human HKGs, and then validated them by comparison with two independent sets of tissue expression profiles. Results showed that our predicted HKG set is more reliable than three previously identified sets of HKGs."
https://openalex.org/W1963808889,"Notch is a transmembrane receptor that controls a diverse array of cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration. The cellular outcome of Notch signaling is dependent on extracellular and intracellular signals, but the complexities of its regulation are not well understood. Canonical Notch signaling involves ligand association that triggers sequential and regulated proteolysis of Notch at several sites. Ligand-dependent proteolysis at the S2 site removes the bulk of the extracellular domain of Notch. Subsequent γ-secretase-mediated intramembrane proteolysis of the remaining membrane-tethered Notch fragment at the S3 site produces a nuclear-destined Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Here we show that following γ-secretase cleavage, Notch is proteolyzed at a novel S5 site. We have identified this S5 site to be eight amino acids downstream of the S3 site. Biochemical fractionation and purification resulted in the identification of the S5 site protease as the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIPEP). Expression of the MIPEP-cleaved NICD (ΔNICD) results in a decrease in cell viability and mitochondria membrane potential. The sequential and regulated proteolysis by γ-secretase and MIPEP suggests a new means by which Notch function can be modulated."
https://openalex.org/W2116653124,"The mammalian DP, RB-like, E2F, and MuvB-like proteins (DREAM) complex, whose key components include p130 and E2F4, plays a fundamental role in repression of cell cycle-specific genes during growth arrest. Mammalian DREAM is well conserved with Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans complexes that repress pivotal developmental genes, but the mammalian complex has been thought to exist only in quiescent cells and not to be linked with development. However, new findings here identify tissue-specific promoters repressed by DREAM in proliferating precursors, revealing a new connection between control of growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Mechanistically, tissue-specific promoter occupation by DREAM is dependent on the integrity of a repressor form of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex."
