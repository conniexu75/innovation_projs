https://openalex.org/W1586952476,Abstract Administration of a physiological dose of radioactive vitamin D3 to vitamin D-deficient chicks results in a localization of the radioactivity isolated from intestinal mucosa within the nuclear chromatin fraction. Extraction and chromatography of this chromatin-bound radioactivity in several systems indicates that 87% of it exists as a polar metabolite of vitamin D3. This polar metabolite has biological activity equivalent to the parent vitamin. The association of this metabolite with the chromatin fraction occurs only in the target intestinal mucosa and is specifically inhibited by pretreatment of the rachitic chick with nonradioactive vitamin D3 or vitamin D3 analogues such as vitamin D2 and dihydrotachysterol3. The time course of appearance of the polar metabolite in the entire intestine parallels the location of radioactivity in the chromatin fraction and is consistent with the lag in the physiological response to vitamin D.

https://openalex.org/W1590700794,"Abstract Reduction of reconstituted native type collagen fibrils with sodium borohydride produced a firmly cross-linked polymer as determined by solubility, thermal shrinkage and dissolution, and renaturation studies, and by examination of the denatured protein by ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, polyacrylamide electrophoresis, and carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography. Maximum reduction occurred within 1 min after treatment of the reconstituted fibrils; approximately 1 mole of tritium was incorporated per mole of collagen when sodium borotritide was used. About 30% of the α chains and 30% of the β subunits were consumed in the reaction, yielding a heterogeneous population of higher molecular weight components. Chemical modification of the collagen aldehydes prevented cross-linking, as did limited modification of lysine or hydroxylysine e-amino groups. Lathyritic collagen also failed to cross-link, probably as a result of diminished aldehyde content. Maximum cross-linking occurred when the collagen was polymerized into native type fibrils. Collagen in solution did not cross-link, and collagen polymerized into other than native type fibrils underwent partial or minimal cross-linking. Borohydride reduction did not produce intramolecular bonds, and no relationship could be found between the degree of intramolecular cross-linking and the ability to form intermolecular cross-links. It is proposed that the effect of borohydride is due to the reduction of Schiff bases which form between the collagen molecules when they are aligned in native type fibrils."

https://openalex.org/W1597737593,"Abstract Mitochondria were isolated from rat liver slices, which had been incubated with (14C)leucine, and fractionated into water-soluble, KCl-soluble, and KCl-insoluble proteins. After a 30-min incubation, all fractions contained radioactivity. Addition of an excess of unlabeled leucine at this time followed by another 30- to 90-min incubation caused a cessation of incorporation into the KCl-insoluble fraction; however, the specific activity of the soluble fractions increased 40 to 90% during this time. Labeling of the water-soluble proteins reached its maximum 30 min after addition of the chase, while the KCl-soluble proteins continued to increase at a linear rate for 90 min after chase addition. The addition of puromycin after a pulse label gave identical results. In time studies, (14C)lysine was incorporated into the KCl-insoluble proteins after 15 min. A lag of 30 min occurred before significant incorporation was observed in the soluble proteins. Chloramphenicol (0.6 to 1.2 mm) inhibited incorporation into the KCl-insoluble proteins but had little effect on that of the soluble proteins. The inhibition of leucine incorporation into the KCl-insoluble proteins and into isolated mitochondria in vitro was specific for the d isomer of chloramphenicol. High concentrations of either the d or l isomer of chloramphenicol inhibited labeling of all of the mitochondrial fractions and the microsomes. This inhibition appeared to result from an effect on respiration since, in isolated mitochondria, respiration of DPNH-linked substrates is inhibited equally by these concentrations of the d or l isomer of chloramphenicol. During short term experiments at low temperatures, cycloheximide inhibited incorporation into the KCl-insoluble proteins less than that into the soluble proteins or microsomes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the biogenesis of mitochondria involves the initial synthesis of certain insoluble proteins by the mitochondria and the subsequent integration of soluble protein synthesized outside the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1650495965,"Abstract Incubation of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid with homogenates of sheep vesicular gland yielded a new product, which has been identified as 9α, 15-dihydroxy-11-ketoprost-13-enoic acid. The identification was based on mass spectrometry of the methyl ester and the methoxime derivative, and on infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet spectroscopy, before and after treatment with alkali. Reduction of the isolated compound with borodeuteride yielded prostaglandin F1α containing deuterium in the ring, as established by mass spectrometry of a derivative. Further proof for the location of the keto group in the isomer was obtained through biosynthesis from [9-3H,3-14C]- and [11-3H,2-14C]8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acids. Incubation with [13D-3H,3-14C]8,11, 14-eicosatrienoic acid revealed that the 13d-hydrogen atom is retained during the formation of the isomer, which is also the case with prostaglandin E1. The mechanism of the conversion of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid into prostaglandins is discussed. The identification of 9α,15-dihydroxy-11-ketoprost-13-enoic acid and the finding that 3H at C-9 is retained during its formation further support the involvement of an endoperoxide in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins."

https://openalex.org/W1509801772,"Initial rate kinetic studies of pig heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase with substrate analogues hydroxymalonate and ketomalonate are reported. At 25° in pH 8.0, 0.05 ionic strength Tris acetate buffer, ketomalonate is reduced rapidly, with half of the turnover number observed with the physiological substrate. No appreciable oxidation of hydroxymalonate could be observed. When malate is oxidized or oxalacetate is reduced, hydroxymalonate inhibits uncompetitively with respect to malate and competitively with respect to oxalacetate, suggesting that the analogue hydroxymalonate binds the enzyme-reduced coenzyme complex but not the enzyme-oxidized coenzyme complex that could oxidize it. The manner in which hydroxymalonate inhibits ketomalonate reduction supports this model with the important addition that the replacement of oxalacetate by ketomalonate induces or potentiates a competitive interaction between hydroxymalonate and reduced coenzyme on the enzyme and appears to strengthen the binding of hydroxymalonate. Because the compulsory order catalytic mechanism developed previously in the literature and amended here shows no ketomalonate or oxalacetate bound to the enzyme form which binds hydroxymalonate, it is believed that the oxidized substrates affecting the inhibition must be bound to the enzyme subunit other than that at which hydroxymalonate is bound."
https://openalex.org/W1483092346,"Abstract Bovine prothrombin, an α2-glycoprotein clotting factor of plasma, has been isolated in high degree of purity in crystalline form as the barium glycoprotein product of interaction. Chemical determinations made on the product showed the following composition, in percentage of the dry weight: protein, 21.5%; barium, 32%; and citrate, 8.9%. That the crystals represent a true prothrombin-metal complex has been established by control studies, x-ray diffraction pattern, chemical composition, and recrystallization. The product showed constant solubility characteristics. Extensive physical and chemical studies of the barium-free protein are presented. Further purification was achieved by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The peak fractions evidenced activity of 3000 Iowa units (Seegers, W. H., Prothrombin, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1962, p. 420) per mg (corresponding to a 600-fold purification), as well as appreciable Factors VII, IX, and X coagulant activities. This product is designated prothrombin in accordance with the nomenclature used by other investigators. The preparation was homogeneous by sedimentation velocity pattern, sedimentation equilibrium analysis, and gel filtration. Despite these indications of homogeneity, physical heterogeneity was shown by immuno- and disc electrophoresis. The multiple coagulant activities and protein subcomponents were found to be homogeneous with respect to molecular weight (70,477 ± 2,789), determined by sedimentation equilibrium in a dissociating solvent consisting of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 0.5% mercaptoethanol, and also with respect to Stokes radius. Physical constants, determined in various systems, include diffusion constant, sedimentation coefficient, frictional ratio, isoelectric point, isoionic point, electrophoretic mobility, and extinction coefficient. Physical data failed to show evidence of dissociation into subunits or fragmentation by dilution to below 0.1% protein or by prolonged exposure to a dissociating solvent. The latter observation suggests that the reduction in sedimentation constant noted in high ionic strength solvents in this study, and by other observers, is probably attributable to changes in shape and hydration of the kinetic unit. The product was also shown to undergo rapid, reversible association in solvents of low ionic strength (T/2 = 0.15). DEAE-Sephadex chromatography resulted in partial activation of the complex, and several homogeneous protein species were isolated and partially characterized. The monomeric molecular weights determined by sedimentation equilibrium in a solvent of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and mercaptoethanol were as follows: (devoid of Factors VII and X), 65,530 ± 1,247; modified zymogen, 52,395 ± 3,449; Factor VII, 33,900 ± 3,390; and Factor X, 37,772 ± 1,234. The modified zymogen was inert in the two-stage assay and in 25% sodium citrate, but readily transformed to thrombin when Factor X was added. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the complex, as isolated in this study, comprises a family of glycoproteins that can undergo a proenzyme-enzyme transformation and that have similar molecular properties but separate clotting activities."

https://openalex.org/W1554560744,"The rate of formation of ribonuclease-S from ribonuclease A by the action of subtilisin was measured at pH 5.5 in the presence and absence of the strongly bound ribonuclease inhibitor, 2′-cytidylate. Presence of the inhibitor in the active center significantly reduced the rate of formation of ribonuclease-S. Since bond 20–21 (and, to a lesser extent, 21–22), the cleavage of which is responsible for the formation of this derivative, is well removed from the active center region, and thus from the binding site of the inhibitor, steric hindrance by the latter can be excluded as the cause for this reduced rate. Instead, it is concluded that the presence of the inhibitor in the active center caused a conformational change which affected a distant region of the molecule. Amino-terminal analysis confirmed cleavage at the expected major site, bond 20–21. The presence of the competitive inhibitors, 2′- and 3′-cytidylate, afforded considerable protection against inactivation of ribonuclease A by trypsin and by chymotrypsin, when digested at 60°. End group analysis confirmed that the bonds split were those expected from previous work of others. The presence of 2′-cytidylate completely prevented the temperature-induced optical rotatory change characteristic of ribonuclease, indicating a high degree of structural stabilization by the ligand. The data presented support the view that the presence of the competitive inhibitor in the active center region alters the proteolytic susceptibility of bonds at multiple sites, situated outside of this region."

https://openalex.org/W2470398077,"Abstract Recent studies have shown that the hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine found in the collagen of vertebrates are synthesized by the hydroxylation of proline and lysine, which have been incorporated into a large polypeptide precursor of collagen called protocollagen. Because the collagen isolated from the cuticle of Ascaris lumbricoides contains less hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine than any other known collagen, it was of interest to determine whether this collagen could serve as a substrate for the synthesis of hydroxyproline by protocollagen proline hydroxylase from a vertebrate source. Essentially no synthesis of hydroxyproline was observed when the hydroxylase from chick embryos was incubated with native cuticle collagen solubilized by either 0.5 m NaCl extraction or pepsin treatment. Both of these large aggregate forms of the collagen, however, served as substrates for hydroxyproline synthesis after they were denatured by heating at 100° for 10 min. A subunit form of the collagen with a lower specific optical rotation than the large aggregate preparations served as a substrate without prior heat treatment, but the rate of hydroxyproline synthesis was increased by boiling the preparation. Comparison of the relative substrate activities and specific optical rotations of various forms of the cuticle collagen indicated an inverse relationship between the rate of hydroxyproline synthesis and the apparent degree of helicity. Previous reports by others have suggested that the subunit structure of collagen from Ascaris cuticle may involve a helical conformation different from that found in other collagens, and it is possible that an unusual conformation of the polypeptide chain or chains of the native cuticle collagen may explain its inability to serve as a substrate for protocollagen proline hydroxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1501650375,"Abstract The techniques of velocity and equilibrium sedimentation have been used to determine conditions under which a well characterized protein, chymotrypsinogen A, already observed to exist as a monomer in certain media, will associate. Single, essentially symmetrical, schlieren patterns were observed in survey velocity experiments covering an extended concentration interval in the pH range 6.5 to 9.5, and at ionic strengths 0.002 to 3, in phosphate, Tris, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and glycine buffers. The salts added to control the ionic strengths were LiCl, NaCl, KCl, and tetramethylammonium chloride. The temperature interval was 5–25°. Increases in the sedimentation coefficient were observed with decreasing ionic strength, suggesting association. The behavior of these coefficients was studied in detail at ionic strengths of 0.002, 0.03, and 0.1 at pH 9.30, which is in the vicinity of the isoelectric point. A value of 2.91 S was found for s020,w. Apparent molecular weights, calculated from equilibrium experiments under the same conditions, showed a marked concentration-dependent increase with decreasing ionic strength. This association is completely reversible, and, within the limits of experimental error, is unaffected by changes in temperature. It is suggested that electrostatic forces may play a significant role in the association at low ionic strength, although hydrogen and hydrophobic bonding cannot be precluded on the basis of present evidence."

https://openalex.org/W2044389286,"RECOVERY from infections caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa is usually followed by a period of resistance to challenge with the homologous parasite1. In some cases this resistance is confined to challenge with the homologous strain, in others it is confined to the same species2 and more rarely extends to related species3,4. It has recently been reported that resistance to challenge can even transcend the generic barrier5. Cox and Milar5 demonstrated that mice which had recovered from infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi resisted challenge with the rodent piroplasm Babesia (Nuttallia) rodhaini but that this protection did not apply to the malaria parasite P. berghei. We have already shown that P. chabaudi protects against P. vinckei, but not against P. berghei3, and that B. microti protects against B. rodhaini4. Independently of Cox and Milar5 we have found that mice which have recovered from infections with Babesia (Nuttallia) microti are resistant to challenge with the virulent malaria parasite P. vinckei. This work both confirms and extends the unexpected discovery made by Cox and Milar5."

https://openalex.org/W2400313484,"Abstract The present study has shown that labeled cholic acid is a major metabolite formed when 7-dehydrocholesterol-4-14C is fed to bile fistula rats. Since biliary and hepatic cholesterol were essentially devoid of radioactivity, it has been postulated that the biogenesis of cholic acid under these conditions may proceed either through a pathway that excludes cholesterol as a metabolic intermediate or through a small pool of cholesterol which is being actively converted to bile acids. In intact rats, however, the efficient conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol was shown. The results are discussed in the light of recent observations that naturally occurring sterols containing 27 carbon atoms could be oxidized to more polar products by microsomal enzymes similar to those which catalyze hydroxylation reactions in the early stages of bile acid biogenesis."
