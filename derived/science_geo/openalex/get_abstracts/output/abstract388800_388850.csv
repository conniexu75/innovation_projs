The materials currently known to best adsorb CO 2 for this purpose tend to involve amine groups; however, the precise molecular details of adsorption often remain murky, and rational improvement of sorbent properties by structural modification has been challenging. Vaidhyanathan et al. (p. 650 ; see the Perspective by Lastoskie ) have crystallographically resolved the binding motifs of CO 2 in an amine-bearing metal-organic framework solid. Accompanying theoretical simulations matched the experimental observations."

Variants can be hard to detect when they lie in heavily duplicated and widely similar regions of sequence known as “dark matter.” Sudmant et al. (p. 641 ) have methods to tease apart the duplicated regions to reveal singly unique nucleotide identifiers. These have turned out to be among the most variable seen in different human population groups—most notably among genes for neurodevelopment and neurological diseases. Such polymorphisms can be genotyped with specificity and may help us understand how variation in copy number may affect human evolution and disease."

Instead, Chung et al. (p. 655 ) used graphene as a substrate for gallium nitride growth and found that nucleation of the gallium nitride layers was enhanced by first depositing zinc oxide, which grew as vertical nanowalls on the graphene. The gallium nitride layers displayed strong photo- and electroluminescence and, even better, the layers could be transferred to flexible substrates such as plastic."

Based on observations of 166 nearby stars with the Keck Telescope, Howard et al. (p. 653 ) report the occurrence of short-period planets around Sun-like stars as a function of planet mass. Planet formation models predicted that planet occurrence would increase with decreasing mass, such that satellites with masses similar to that of Neptune, and less, would be more common than gas-giant planets like Jupiter. Contrary to predictions, there is no dearth of planets with masses 5 to 30 times that of Earth, implying that the models may need revision. Nevertheless, observations suggest that 23% of Sun-like stars may be orbited by a close-in, terrestrial mass planet."

Here, we use nucleosomes methylated on DNA and on histone H3 in an affinity assay, in conjunction with a SILAC-based proteomic analysis, to identify “crosstalk” between these two distinct classes of modification. Our analysis reveals proteins whose binding to nucleosomes is regulated by methylation of CpGs, H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 or a combination thereof. We identify the origin recognition complex (ORC), including LRWD1 as a subunit, to be a methylation-sensitive nucleosome interactor that is recruited cooperatively by DNA and histone methylation. Other interactors, such as the lysine demethylase Fbxl11/KDM2A, recognize nucleosomes methylated on histones, but their recruitment is disrupted by DNA methylation. These data establish SILAC nucleosome affinity purifications (SNAP) as a tool for studying the dynamics between different chromatin modifications and provide a modification binding “profile” for proteins regulated by DNA and histone methylation.

The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer made up of two copies each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (Luger et al., 1997Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle at 2.8 A resolution.Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6483) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes are arranged into higher-order structures by additional proteins, including the linker histone H1, to form chromatin. Because chromatin serves as the primary substrate for all DNA-related processes in the nucleus, its structure and activity must be tightly controlled. Two key mechanisms known to regulate the functional state of chromatin in higher eukaryotes are the C5 methylation of DNA at cytosines within CpG dinucleotides and the posttranslational modification of amino acids of histone proteins. Whereas DNA methylation is usually linked to silent chromatin and is present in most regions of the genome (Bernstein et al., 2007Bernstein B.E. Meissner A. Lander E.S. The mammalian epigenome.Cell. 2007; 128: 669-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar), the repertoire and the location of histone modifications are much more diverse, with different modifications associated with different biological functions (Kouzarides, 2007Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7536) Google Scholar). Most modifications can also be removed from chromatin, thus conferring flexibility in the regulation of its activity. Due to the large number of possible modifications and the enormous diversity that can be generated through combinatorial modifications, epigenetic information can be stored in chromatin modification patterns. Several chromatin-regulating factors have recently been identified that recognize methylated DNA or modified histone proteins. Such effector molecules use a range of different recognition domains such as methyl-CpG-binding domains (MBD), zinc fingers (ZnF), chromo-domains, or plant homeodomains (PHD) in order to establish and orchestrate biological events (Sasai and Defossez, 2009Sasai N. Defossez P.A. Many paths to one goal? The proteins that recognize methylated DNA in eukaryotes.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2009; 53: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Taverna et al., 2007Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. How chromatin-binding modules interpret histone modifications: lessons from professional pocket pickers.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). However, most of these studies were conducted using isolated DNA or histone peptides and cannot recapitulate the situation found in chromatin. Considering the three-dimensional organization of chromatin in the nucleus, DNA methylation and histone modifications most likely act in a concerted manner by creating a “modification landscape” that must be interpreted by proteins that are able to recognize large molecular assemblies (Ruthenburg et al., 2007Ruthenburg A.J. Li H. Patel D.J. Allis C.D. Multivalent engagement of chromatin modifications by linked binding modules.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). In an effort to increase our understanding of how combinatorial modifications on chromatin might modulate its activity, we set out to identify factors that recognize methylated DNA and histones in the context of nucleosomes. We reasoned that using whole nucleosomes would enable us to find factors that integrate the folded nucleosomal structure with modifications on the DNA and on histones. Here, we describe a SILAC nucleosome affinity purification (SNAP) approach for the identification of proteins that are influenced by CpG methylation and histone H3 K4, K9, or K27 methylation (or a combination thereof) in the context of a nucleosome. Our results reveal many proteins and complexes that can read the chromatin modification status. These results establish SNAP as a valuable approach in defining the chromatin “interactome.” Proteins recognize modifications of chromatin in the context of a nucleosome. However, to date, modification-interacting proteins have been identified using modified DNA or modified histone peptides as affinity columns. We set out to identify proteins that can sense the presence of DNA and histone methylation within the physiological background of a nucleosome. To this end, we reconstituted recombinant nucleosomes containing combinations of CpG-methylated DNA and histone H3 trimethylated at lysine residues 4, 9, and 27 (H3K4me3, H3K9me3, or H3K27me3). These modified nucleosomes were immobilized on beads and used to affinity purify interacting proteins from SILAC-labeled HeLa nuclear extracts (Figure 1A ). Bound proteins regulated by the different modification patterns were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). The methylation of lysines in H3 was accomplished by native chemical ligation (Muir, 2003Muir T.W. Semisynthesis of proteins by expressed protein ligation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 249-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). An existing protocol (Shogren-Knaak et al., 2003Shogren-Knaak M.A. Fry C.J. Peterson C.L. A native peptide ligation strategy for deciphering nucleosomal histone modifications.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15744-15748Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was adapted to develop an improved method that allows the purification of large quantities of recombinant tail-less human H3.1 (Figure 1B). This method employs the coexpression of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease and a modified TEV cleavage site (Tolbert and Wong, 2002Tolbert T.J. Wong C.H. New methods for proteomic research: preparation of proteins with N-terminal cysteines for labeling and conjugation.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 2171-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to expose a cysteine in front of the histone core sequence in E. coli (Figure S1A available online). The tail-less H3.1 starting with a cysteine at position 32 was ligated to thioester peptides spanning the N terminus of histone H3.1 (residues 1–31) and containing the above-mentioned methylated lysines (Figure S1B). The resulting full-length modified H3.1 proteins (Figure S1C) were subsequently refolded into histone octamers together with recombinant human histones H2A, H2B, and H4 (Figure 1C). As nucleosomal DNAs, we used two biotinylated 185 bp DNA fragments containing either the 601 or the 603 nucleosome positioning sequences (Lowary and Widom, 1998Lowary P.T. Widom J. New DNA sequence rules for high affinity binding to histone octamer and sequence-directed nucleosome positioning.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Both DNAs have similar nucleosome-forming properties, albeit with different sequences (Figure S1D), which allows us to test for sequence specificities of methyl-CpG interactors. The nucleosomal DNAs were treated with recombinant prokaryotic M.SssI DNA methyltransferase, which mimics the methylation pattern found at CpG dinucleotides in eukaryotic genomic DNA (Figures S1E and S1F). Finally, nucleosomal core particles were reconstituted from the nucleosomal DNAs and octamers and were immobilized on streptavidin beads via the biotinylated DNAs. All assembly reactions were quality controlled on native PAGE gels (Figure S1G). The immobilized modified nucleosomes were incubated in HeLaS3 nuclear extracts and probed for the binding of known modification-interacting factors to make sure that the nucleosomal templates were functional. Figure 1D shows that, as expected, PHF8, HP1α, and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) subunit SUZ12 (Bannister et al., 2001Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O.

In addition, we did not detect any modification of the immobilized nucleosomal histones by modifying activities present in the nuclear extract (Figure S1H). In order to identify proteins that bind to chromatin in a modification-dependent manner, we utilized a SILAC pull-down approach that we have developed to identify interactors of histone modifications (Vermeulen et al., 2010Vermeulen M. Eberl H.C. Matarese F. Marks H. Denissov S. Butter F. Lee K.K. Olsen J.V. Hyman A.A. Stunnenberg H.G. Mann M. Quantitative interaction proteomics and genome-wide profiling of epigenetic histone marks and their readers.Cell. 2010; 142: 967-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We simply replaced immobilized peptides with complete reconstituted modified nucleosomes (Figure 2A ). All pull-downs were repeated in two experiments. In a “forward” experiment, the unmodified nucleosomes were incubated with light (R0K0) extracts, and the modified nucleosomes were incubated with heavy-labeled (R10K8) extracts, as depicted in Figure 2A. In an independent “reverse” experiment, the extracts were exchanged. Bound proteins were identified and quantified by high-resolution MS for both pull-down experiments. A logarithmic (Log2) plot of the SILAC ratios heavy/light (ratio H/L) of the forward (x axis) and reverse (y axis) experiments for each identified protein allows the unbiased identification of proteins that specifically bind to the modified or the unmodified nucleosomes. Proteins that preferentially bind to the modified nucleosomes show a high ratio H/L in the forward and a low ratio H/L in the reverse experiment and can, therefore, be identified as outliers in the bottom-right quadrant. Proteins that are excluded by the modification have a low ratio H/L in the forward experiment and a high ratio H/L in the reverse experiment and appear in the top-left quadrant. Background binders have a ratio H/L of around 1:1 and cluster around the intersection of the x and y axes. Outliers in the bottom-left quadrant are contaminating proteins. Outliers in the top-right quadrant are false positives. An enrichment/exclusion ratio of 1.5 in both directions generally identifies outliers outside of the background cluster. We consider a protein to be significantly regulated when it is enriched/excluded at least 2-fold. Higher ratios H/L in the forward and lower ratios H/L in the reverse experiments indicate stronger binding, whereas stronger exclusion is indicated by lower ratios H/L in the forward and higher ratios H/L in the reverse experiments. The SNAP approach was used to identify proteins that are recruited or excluded by DNA methylation, histone H3 methylation, or a combination of both (Figures 2B and 2C and Figure S2). In Table 1, Table 2, and Table S2, we summarize the proteins that display a regulation of at least 1.5 in both the forward and reverse experiments, thus defining the proteins that are enriched or excluded by the modified nucleosomes. The complete MS analysis defining all interacting proteins in all pull-down reactions is summarized in Table S1.Table 1Proteins Enriched or Excluded by CpG-Methylated DNA and Nucleosomes as Identified by SNAPEnrichment/Exclusion (Ratio H/L Forward)601me DNA603me DNA601me Nuc603me NucEnriched Proteinsvery strong enrichment (>10)ZBTB33ZBTB33ZHX2strong enrichment (5–10)ZHX1ZHX1MBD2bNuRD complex.HOMEZUHRF1moderate enrichment (2–5)ZBTB9ZHX2ZHX3MBD2bNuRD complex.MTA2bNuRD complex.CDK2AP1bNuRD complex.GATAD2AbNuRD complex.FOXA1CHD4bNuRD complex.ZNF295MTA3bNuRD complex.HOMEZMTA1bNuRD complex.GATAD2BbNuRD complex.MBD4ZHX2MTA2bNuRD complex.GATAD2AbNuRD complex.MTA3bNuRD complex.ZHX3CDK2AP1bNuRD complex.FOXA1CHD4bNuRD complex.GATAD2BbNuRD complex.RFXANKdRegulatory factor X.RFXAPdRegulatory factor X.MTA1bNuRD complex.PBX1RFX5dRegulatory factor X.PKNOX1FIZ1TRIM28ZBTB40MeCP2PAX6MTERFMBD2bNuRD complex.GATAD2AbNuRD complex.MTA2bNuRD complex.MBD2bNuRD complex.MBD4ZBTB12CHD4bNuRD complex.MeCP2GATAD2BbNuRD complex.ZHX3ZHX1C14orf93RBBP4bNuRD complex.RBBP7bNuRD complex.MTERFPAX6LCORweak enrichment (1.5–2)PAX9CHD3bNuRD complex.CUX1ZNF740∗RBBP7bNuRD complex.POGZKIAA1958UHRF1ZNF787MBD4CHD3bNuRD complex.ZFHX3ZBTB9∗NR2C1MAD2BMTA2bNuRD complex.MBD4CHD4bNuRD complex.GATAD2AbNuRD complex.PPIBACTR5ZBED5AURKAHOXC10JUNBExcluded Proteinsweak exclusion (0.5–0.67)ANKRD32Atherin∗SKP1∗,aBCOR complex.RBBP5NUFIP1CBFBMSH3RBBP5moderate exclusion (0.2–0.5)RB1TFEBSIX4HES7ZFP161YAF2TIGD5ARID4BCXXC5SKP1aBCOR complex.JRKUSF2USF1FBXW11RAD1ZBTB2MLXBCORL1ZNF639SP3HES7TCOF1∗TFDP1ATF1MLLSKP1aBCOR complex.RECQLONECUT2ZFP161TIGD1RB1E2F3CUX1EEDcPRC2 complex.RUNXRNF2aBCOR complex.RING1aBCOR complex.BANPPRDM11SUZ12cPRC2 complex.NAIF1MYCSUB1RMI1TOP3ARPA2eReplication factor A complex.NAIF1RPA1eReplication factor A complex.RPA3eReplication factor A complex.KIAA1553TCF7L2RNF2aBCOR complex.BCORaBCOR complex.RING1aBCOR complex.BANP∗strong exclusion (0.1–0.2)ZBTB25PURBRPA1eReplication factor A complex.RPA3∗,eReplication factor A complex.RPA2eReplication factor A complex.MNTUBF1UBF2EEDcPRC2 complex.SUZ12cPRC2 complex.VHLE2F4BCORaBCOR complex.FBXL10aBCOR complex.FBXL11SUZ12cPRC2 complex.RPA3eReplication factor A complex.SSBP1RPA2eReplication factor A complex.RPA1eReplication factor A complex.CGGBP1UBF2FBXL11PURAUBF1ZBTB2ZNF639RAD1HUS1PURBBCORL1OLA1MAXL3MBTL3BCORaBCOR complex.FBXL10aBCOR complex.PCGF1aBCOR complex.FBXL11SUB1FBXL10aBCOR complex.very strong exclusion (<0.1)E2F1PCGF1aBCOR complex.ZNF395TIMM8AKIAA1553bHLHB2CGGBP1GMEB2GTF3C2fTFIIIC complex.BCORaBCOR complex.GTF3C4fTFIIIC complex.FBXL10aBCOR complex.PCGF1aBCOR complex.GTF3C1fTFIIIC complex.E2F1DEAF1GTF3C3fTFIIIC complex.GTF3C6fTFIIIC complex.GTF3C5fTFIIIC complex.HIF1ACXXC5BCORL1∗FBXL11Syntenin1ARNTHES7USF2bHLHB2USF1PCGF1aBCOR complex.AtherinL3MBTL3FLYWCH1Syntenin1ZFP161Table 1 shows the proteins that were enriched or excluded by CpG-methylated DNA or nucleosomes compared to the respective unmodified species at least 1.5-fold in both the forward and reverse pull-down experiments.

The data set includes a number of proteins (about 20%) that are already known to bind methyl-DNA and methyl-H3, as well as many proteins whose regulation by modifications had not been previously defined. The presence of many known methyl-binding proteins validates our approach. The database provides a complex “profile” for the modulation of proteins by DNA and histone methylation that have the potential to recognize specific “chromatin landscapes.” Below, we highlight several interactions with modified nucleosomes, which exemplify the different modes of regulation that we observe (summarized in Figures 2D and 2E). Table 1 shows DNA- and nucleosome-binding proteins regulated by CpG methylation. The two different methylated DNAs were subjected to SNAP analysis either on their own (601me DNA and 603me DNA) or assembled into nucleosomes (601me Nuc and 603me Nuc). We identify several well-characterized methyl-binding proteins such as MBD2 (Sasai and Defossez, 2009Sasai N. Defossez P.A. Many paths to one goal? The proteins that recognize methylated DNA in eukaryotes.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2009; 53: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to be enriched on the 601me and 603me DNAs. MBD2 is enriched on both DNAs and exemplifies a form of methyl-CpG binding that is not sequence selective. In contrast, other proteins (e.g., ZNF295) display sequence specificity toward only one of the methylated DNAs, suggesting that they may recognize CpG methylation in a sequence-specific manner. We also identify many proteins that preferentially recognize nonmethylated DNA and are excluded by CpG methylation. The most prominent example is the general RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIC. All subunits of the TFIIIC complex show specific exclusion from the 603me DNA (e.g., GTF3C5 shown in Figure 2D), most likely because this DNA (unlike the 601me DNA) contains two putative B box elements (Figure S1D), sequences that are known TFIIIC-binding sites. This defines a form of methyl-CpG-dependent exclusion that is sequence specific. CpG methylation can have a distinct influence on protein binding when it is present within a nucleosomal background. Factors such as MeCP2 are specifically enriched on CpG-methylated DNA only in the context of a nucleosome, but not on free DNA (Figure 2D). Other factors, such as L3MBTL3, show nucleosome-dependent exclusion by CpG methylation. These two factors are influenced by DNA methylation regardless of DNA sequence. Several proteins, such as the DNA-binding factor USF2, are specifically excluded only from 601me nucleosomes. This is most likely due to an E box motif in the 601 DNA (Figure S1D), which is recognized by USF2. One final example of the effect of nucleosomes on DNA-binding proteins is demonstrated by the observation that many proteins such as TFIIIC bind free DNA but cannot recognize the DNA when it is assembled into nucleosomes. This is probably due to binding motifs (such as the B box motif) being occluded by the histone octamer (Figure 2D and Table S2). This type of interaction may identify proteins that need nucleosome-remodeling activities to bind their DNA element. Together, these examples highlight the additional constraints forced on protein-DNA interactions by the histone octamer. Table 2 shows a summary of the proteins enriched or excluded by nucleosomes trimethylated at H3K4, H3K9, or H3K27 in the presence or absence of DNA methylation. Trimethylation of H3K4 is primarily associated with active promoters, whereas trimethyl H3K9 and H3K27, as well as methyl-CpG, are hallmarks of silenced regions of the genome (Kouzarides, 2007Kouzarides T.

In addition, a number of uncharacterized factors were identified. For example, Spindlin1 binds strongly to H3K4me3. Spindlin1 is a highly conserved protein consisting of three Spin/Ssty domains that have recently been shown to fold into Tudor-like domains (Zhao et al., 2007Zhao Q. Qin L. Jiang F. Wu B. Yue W. Xu F. Rong Z. Yuan H. Xie X. Gao Y. et al.Structure of human spindlin1. Tandem tudor-like domains for cell cycle regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), motifs known to bind methyl lysines on histone proteins. Most notably, we identify the origin recognition complex (Orc2, Orc3, Orc4, Orc5, and to a lesser extent Orc1) to be enriched on both H3K9me3- and H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes. Because no binding was detected on H3K4me3 nucleosomes, the origin recognition complex (ORC) seems to specifically recognize heterochromatic modifications (Figure 2E). One protein, PHF14, and, to a lesser extent, HMG20A and HMG20B are excluded by the H3K4me3 modification. Of interest, these factors represent the only significant examples of proteins excluded from nucleosomes by methylation of histones, including methylation at H3K9 and H3K27. The SNAP approach allows us to investigate cooperative effects between DNA methylation and histone modifications on the recruitment of proteins to chromatin. Analysis of our data reveals several examples of such a regulation (Figures 2E and 2F). We observe a cooperative stronger binding of UHRF1 to H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes in the presence of CpG methylation. Similarly, the ORC (as shown for the Orc2 subunit) can recognize nucleosomes more effectively if CpG methylation coincides with the repressive histone marks H3K9me3 or H3K27me3. This might explain its preferential localization to heterochromatic regions in the nucleus (Pak et al., 1997Pak D.T. Pflumm M. Chesnokov I. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Marr J. Romanowski P. Botchan M.R.

In contrast, the H3K36 demethylase Fbxl11/KDM2A is enriched by H3K9 methylation but excluded by DNA methylation. Finally, the PRC2 complex is enriched on H3K27me3 nucleosomes (and to a lesser extent on H3K9me3 nucleosomes), but incorporation of methyl-CpG DNA counteracts this recruitment, as shown for the EED (Figure 2E) and the SUZ12 (Figure 2F) subunits. These findings demonstrate the ability of these factors to simultaneously monitor the methylation status of both histones and DNA on a single nucleosome. The proteins regulated by nucleosome modifications in the SNAP experiments were subjected to a cluster analysis in order to define common features of regulation. In this analysis, the SILAC enrichment values are represented as a heat map in which proteins with similar interaction profiles group into clusters that may be indicative of protein complexes. Figure 3 shows that members of several known complexes cluster together in this analysis, including the BCOR and the NuRD corepressor complexes (Gearhart et al., 2006Gearhart M.D. Corcoran C.M.

This can lead to inappropriate reactions to a fear-associated trigger, such as a bright light or loud noise. This type of reaction appears to underpin posttraumatic stress disorder, but there is little understanding of when training to inhibit fear may fail or succeed. Using a combination of electrophysiology and behavioral training in mice, Clem and Huganir (p. 1108 , published online 28 October) observed that fear conditioning increased synaptic transmission by calcium-permeable AMPA receptors into the part of the brain that controls emotional responses (the amygdala). This effect lasted for about a week, during which the fearful memories could be erased if the animals were trained to reduce conditioned fear responses. Postmortem brain slices showed that the fear-induced synaptic changes also reversed, except in transgenic mice with a mutant subunit of the AMPA receptor."

This protein appears to have multiple and varied functions, including the ability to form distinctive complexes in the nucleus that suppress tumorigenesis and promote apoptotic cell death. Giorgi et al. (p. 1247 , published online 28 October; see the Perspective by Culjkovic-Kraljacic and Borden ) have proposed a mechanism by which PML influences the cellular signals that promote apoptosis. The protein was localized at sites of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it associated with a calcium channel, a protein kinase, and a protein phosphatase, to regulate calcium mobilization into the mitochondrion, which then triggers the cell death program."
https://openalex.org/W1986892307,"The recent success of channelrhodopsin in optogenetics has also caused increasing interest in enzymes that are directly activated by light. We have identified in the genome of the bacterium <i>Beggiatoa</i> a DNA sequence encoding an adenylyl cyclase directly linked to a BLUF (blue light receptor using FAD) type light sensor domain. In <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes, this photoactivated adenylyl cyclase (bPAC) showed cyclase activity that is low in darkness but increased 300-fold in the light. This enzymatic activity decays thermally within 20 s in parallel with the red-shifted BLUF photointermediate. bPAC is well expressed in pyramidal neurons and, in combination with cyclic nucleotide gated channels, causes efficient light-induced depolarization. In the <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system, bPAC mediates light-dependent cAMP increase and behavioral changes in freely moving animals. bPAC seems a perfect optogenetic tool for light modulation of cAMP in neuronal cells and tissues and for studying cAMP-dependent processes in live animals."
https://openalex.org/W2031746153,"The mechanisms that promote excitatory synapse formation and maturation have been extensively studied. However, the molecular events that limit excitatory synapse development so that synapses form at the right time and place and in the correct numbers are less well understood. We have identified a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Ephexin5, which negatively regulates excitatory synapse development until EphrinB binding to the EphB receptor tyrosine kinase triggers Ephexin5 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation. The degradation of Ephexin5 promotes EphB-dependent excitatory synapse development and is mediated by Ube3A, a ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in the human cognitive disorder Angelman syndrome and duplicated in some forms of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). These findings suggest that aberrant EphB/Ephexin5 signaling during the development of synapses may contribute to the abnormal cognitive function that occurs in Angelman syndrome and, possibly, ASDs."

The superficial layers of the tectal neuropil receive input from retinal axons, while its deeper layers convey the processed information to premotor areas. Imaging with a genetically encoded calcium indicator revealed that the deep layers, as well as the dendrites of single tectal neurons, are preferentially activated by small visual stimuli. This spatial filtering relies on GABAergic interneurons (using the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid) that are located in the superficial input layer and respond only to large visual stimuli. Photo-ablation of these cells with KillerRed, or silencing of their synaptic transmission, eliminates the size tuning of deeper layers and impairs the capture of prey."

Many of these proteins bind small metabolites; a few interactions were previously known, but the vast majority are new. Importantly, many key regulatory proteins such as protein kinases bind metabolites. Ergosterol was found to bind many proteins and may function as a general regulator. It is required for the activity of Ypk1, a mammalian AKT/SGK kinase homolog. Our study defines potential key regulatory steps in lipid biosynthetic pathways and suggests that small metabolites may play a more general role as regulators of protein activity and function than previously appreciated."

We describe purification, engineering, and characterization of photoactivated nucleotidyl cyclases that can be used to manipulate cAMP and cGMP levels in vivo. We identified the blaC gene encoding a putative photoactivated adenylyl cyclase in the Beggiatoa sp. PS genome. BlaC contains a BLUF domain involved in blue-light sensing using FAD and a nucleotidyl cyclase domain. The blaC gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its product was purified. Irradiation of BlaC in vitro resulted in a small red shift in flavin absorbance, typical of BLUF photoreceptors. BlaC had adenylyl cyclase activity that was negligible in the dark and up-regulated by light by 2 orders of magnitude. To convert BlaC into a guanylyl cyclase, we constructed a model of the nucleotidyl cyclase domain and mutagenized several residues predicted to be involved in substrate binding. One triple mutant, designated BlgC, was found to have photoactivated guanylyl cyclase in vitro. Irradiation with blue light of the E. coli cya mutant expressing BlaC or BlgC resulted in the significant increases in cAMP or cGMP synthesis, respectively. BlaC, but not BlgC, restored cAMP-dependent growth of the mutant in the presence of light. Small protein sizes, negligible activities in the dark, high light-to-dark activation ratios, functionality at broad temperature range and physiological pH, as well as utilization of the naturally occurring flavins as chromophores make BlaC and BlgC attractive for optogenetic applications in various animal and microbial models."

https://openalex.org/W2016848669,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine with important effects on processes such as fibrosis, angiogenesis, and immunosupression. Using bioinformatics, we identified SMAD2, one of the mediators of TGF-β signaling, as a predicted target for a microRNA, microRNA-155 (miR-155). MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs that have emerged as an important class of gene expression regulators. miR-155 has been found to be involved in the regulation of the immune response in myeloid cells. Here, we provide direct evidence of binding of miR-155 to a predicted binding site and the ability of miR-155 to repress SMAD2 protein expression. We employed a lentivirally transduced monocyte cell line (THP1-155) containing an inducible miR-155 transgene to show that endogenous levels of SMAD2 protein were decreased after sustained overexpression of miR-155. This decrease in SMAD2 led to a reduction in both TGF-β-induced SMAD-2 phosphorylation and SMAD-2-dependent activation of the expression of the CAGA(12)LUC reporter plasmid. Overexpression of miR-155 altered the cellular responses to TGF-β by changing the expression of a set of genes that is involved in inflammation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Our study provides firm evidence of a role for miR-155 in directly repressing SMAD2 expression, and our results demonstrate the relevance of one of the two predicted target sites in SMAD2 3'-UTR. Altogether, our data uncover an important role for miR-155 in modulating the cellular response to TGF-β with possible implications in several human diseases where homeostasis of TGF-β might be altered."

Tom7, a subunit of the TOM40 complex, regulates association of Mdm10 with the TOB complex. Here, we analyzed the role of Tom7 in assembly of β-barrel proteins, including Tom40, a central channel subunit of the TOM40 complex, and porin. Depletion of Tom7 decreased transient accumulation of Tom40 at the level of the TOB complex and retarded assembly of porin in vitro. On the other hand, overexpression of Tom7 resulted in enhanced accumulation of in vitro imported Tom40 in the TOB complex, yet it did not affect the in vitro assembly of porin. Site-specific photocross-linking in vivo revealed that Tom7 directly interacts with Tom40 through its transmembrane segment and with Mdm10.

https://openalex.org/W2025772499,"HDAC3 is a member of the class I histone deacetylase family that regulates gene expression by deacetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. HDAC3 activity has been shown to be modulated by interaction with the co-repressors NCoR and SMRT. Here, we present evidence that the nuclear protein DBC1 is an endogenous inhibitor of HDAC3. DBC1 has been previously identified as a regulator of some nuclear receptors, the methyltransferase SUV39H1, and the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. Furthermore, DBC1 has been shown to influence transcription regulation and apoptosis, and it may also act as a tumor suppressor. We found that DBC1 interacts and specifically inhibits the deacetylase HDAC3. This interaction depends on the N terminus of DBC1 and the C terminus of HDAC3. Expression of DBC1 not only inhibited HDAC3 activity but also altered its subcellular distribution. In addition, knockdown of endogenous DBC1 in cells and knock-out in mouse tissues increased HDAC3 deacetylase activity. Together, these results identify DBC1 as a new regulator of HDAC3 and demonstrate that DBC1 is a negative regulator of two key distinct deacetylases, SIRT1 and HDAC3. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the biological roles of DBC1 and HDAC3 in metabolic diseases and cancer."

Here we show that this editing event is evolutionarily conserved from human to chicken. Analyzing recombinant GABAA receptor subunits expressed in HEK293 cells, our results suggest that editing at the I/M site in α3 has functional consequences on receptor expression.

The reduction in cell surface levels is independent of the subunit combination as it is observed for α3 in combination with either the β2 or the β3 subunit. Further, an amino acid substitution at the corresponding I/M site in the α1 subunit has a similar effect on cell surface presentation, indicating the importance of this site for receptor trafficking.

RNA editing is a mechanism used in the mammalian nervous system to provide alterations in the protein sequence by co-transcriptional modification of single nucleotides. This modification is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR1 and ADAR2) that can selectively modify adenosine to inosine residues within double stranded pre-mRNAs. Within mRNA transcripts, inosine is read as guanosine by the translation machinery. Therefore, this mechanism has the potential to change the amino acid sequence and thereby the function of the protein. Several gene products encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission have been shown to be A-to-I edited, including ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels as well as a G-protein-coupled receptor and thereby creating diverse isoforms of proteins essential for balanced neuronal kinetics (reviewed in Ref. 1Jepson J.E.

These unique kinetic properties have been shown to play an important role in the maturation of developing neurons (17Ortinski P.I. Lu C. Takagaki K. Fu Z. Vicini S. J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 1718-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Receptors containing the α3 subunit represent ∼10–15% of the total GABAA receptors in the adult brain (18McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar).The purpose of this study was to analyze whether editing at the I/M site influences the subcellular distribution of α3 containing GABAA receptors. We show that the developmental increase in editing at the I/M site is inversely related to the α3 protein expression. By using transiently expressed GABAA receptor subunits, we illustrate that I/M editing of α3 reduces cell surface and total numbers of this subunit. We hypothesize that A-to-I editing decreases the amount of α3 subunit containing GABAA receptors, possibly in favor of α1 containing receptors that is more abundant in the adult brain.

RNA editing is a mechanism used in the mammalian nervous system to provide alterations in the protein sequence by co-transcriptional modification of single nucleotides. This modification is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR1 and ADAR2) that can selectively modify adenosine to inosine residues within double stranded pre-mRNAs. Within mRNA transcripts, inosine is read as guanosine by the translation machinery. Therefore, this mechanism has the potential to change the amino acid sequence and thereby the function of the protein. Several gene products encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission have been shown to be A-to-I edited, including ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels as well as a G-protein-coupled receptor and thereby creating diverse isoforms of proteins essential for balanced neuronal kinetics (reviewed in Ref. 1Jepson J.E. Reenan R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1779: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).One of the most well studied substrates for editing in the brain is the transcript coding for the AMPA glutamate receptor (GluA). AMPA receptors consist of four subunits (GluA1–GluA4) in different combinations. Changing a codon for glutamine to arginine in GluA2 is essential to the organism and required for a normal brain development (2Brusa R. Zimmermann F. Koh D.S. Feldmeyer D. Gass P. Seeburg P.H. Sprengel R. Science. 1995; 270: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 3Feldmeyer D. Kask K. Brusa R. Kornau H.C. Kolhekar R. Rozov A. Burnashev N. Jensen V. Hvalby O. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).We have previously found that the mouse Gabra-3 transcript, coding for the α3 subunit of the GABAA receptor undergoes site-selective A-to-I editing causing an isoleucine to methionine (I/M) change in the third transmembrane region (TM3) (4Ohlson J. Pedersen J.S. Haussler D. Ohman M. RNA. 2007; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The chloride-permeable (GABAA) receptors are the main mediators of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system (reviewed in Ref. 5Farrant M. Kaila K. Prog. Brain Res. 2007; 160: 59-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride ion channels can be formed from at least 16 different subunits: α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ϵ, θ, and π (6Baumann S.W. Baur R. Sigel E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10100-10104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The functional diversity of GABAA receptors is based on subunit heterogeneity. Individual neurons express a range of subunits resulting in the formation of a large variety of structurally and functionally different receptor subtypes (7Farrar S.J. Whiting P.J. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10100-10104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8Benke D. Mertens S. Trzeciak A. Gillessen D. Mohler H. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4151-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the adult brain, the most common GABAA receptor is composed of two α1, two β2, and one γ2 subunit (7Farrar S.J. Whiting P.J.

However, subunit composition is different during embryogenesis and changes throughout development (9Laurie D.J. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H. J.

The major change occurs among the α subunits, where α1 expression increases with age and peaks in the adult animal, whereas the α3 subunit is the predominant subunit during early development but declines with age (11Bosman L.W.

Neurosci. 2004; 19: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Receptors containing the α3 subunit are characterized by slow activation, desensitization, and deactivation and by low GABA sensitivity (13Böhme I. Rabe H. Lüddens H. J. Biol.

We have recently shown that activation of LXR regulates cellular fuel utilization in adipocytes. In contrast, the role of LXR in human adipocyte lipolysis, the major function of human white fat cells, is not clear. In the present study, we stimulated in vitro differentiated human and murine adipocytes with the LXR agonist GW3965 and observed an increase in basal lipolysis. Microarray analysis of human adipocyte mRNA following LXR activation revealed an altered gene expression of several lipolysis-regulating proteins, which was also confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. We show that expression and intracellular localization of perilipin1 (PLIN1) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) are affected by GW3965. Although LXR activation does not influence phosphorylation status of HSL, HSL activity is required for the lipolytic effect of GW3965. This effect is abolished by PLIN1 knockdown. In addition, we demonstrate that upon activation, LXR binds to the proximal regions of the PLIN1 and HSL promoters. By selective knock-down of either LXR isoform, we show that LXRα is the major isoform mediating the lipolysis-related effects of LXR. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that activation of LXRα up-regulates basal human adipocyte lipolysis. This is at least partially mediated through LXR binding to the PLIN1 promoter and down-regulation of PLIN1 expression.

Obesity and its associated insulin resistance are important risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue is the main organ for energy storage and release. During adipocyte lipolysis triglycerides (TGs) 2The abbreviations used are: TGtriglycerideATGLadipose triglyceride lipaseBay4-isopropyl-3-methyl-2-[1-(3(S)-methyl-piperidin-1-yl)-methanoyl]- 2H-isoxazol-5-oneCIDEC and CIDEAcell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor, α subunit-like effector C and A, respectivelyFFAfree fatty acidHSLhormone-sensitive lipaseLXRliver X receptorPLIN1perilipin 1SAMsignificance analysis of microarrays. are hydrolyzed into free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol (1Arner P. Langin D. Curr. Opin. Lipidology. 2007; 18: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is well established that spontaneous (basal) lipolysis is increased in obesity and that the ensuing increment in circulating FFAs promotes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes via several mechanisms (2Arner P. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 19: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of adipocyte TGs is regulated by two lipases: adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and the tri/diglyceride lipase hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (1Arner P. Langin D. Curr. Opin. Lipidology. 2007; 18: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Activity of HSL is regulated by phosphorylation on several serine residues (3Lafontan M. Langin D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2009; 48: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Lipolytic activity of ATGL requires the presence of the cofactor Comparative Gene Identification 58 (CGI-58). Together, HSL and ATGL are responsible for more than 95% of the TG hydrolysis in murine white adipose tissue (WAT) (4Schweiger M. Schreiber R. Haemmerle G. Lass A. Fledelius C. Jacobsen P.

However, the respective role of ATGL and HSL in the regulation of basal and catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis in human adipocytes is not quite clear (5Ryden M. Jocken J. van Harmelen V. Dicker A.

Besides lipases, the lipid droplet-coating proteins are also known important regulators of lipolysis (3Lafontan M. Langin D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2009; 48: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The most essential group is the perilipin (PLIN) family. The phosphoprotein PLIN1 is the most abundant lipid droplet-coating protein in adipocytes (7Marcinkiewicz A. Gauthier D. Garcia A. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11901-11909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the basal, unphosphorylated state, PLIN1 inhibits TG breakdown by restricting the access of lipases to the lipid droplet, thereby keeping basal lipolysis at a low level (8Brasaemle D.L. J.

Metab. 2005; 19: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition to PLIN members, other lipid droplet-associated proteins may also regulate lipolysis. Down-regulation of cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor, α subunit-like effector C (CIDEC) by siRNA has been shown to increase lipolysis and decrease lipid droplet-size in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (13Puri V.

In addition to the acute hormonal lipolytic regulators such as catecholamines, many other factors contribute to the fine-tuning of FFA release from adipocytes (3Lafontan M. Langin D. Prog.

In this study we have investigated the role of LXR in human adipocyte lipolysis to further elucidate a possible link between this receptor system and insulin resistance. The role of LXR isoforms on expression, function, and localization of lipolysis-regulating proteins was examined. Human preadipocytes were differentiated as previously described (23Dicker A.

To examine the localization of PLIN1 and HSL in the same cell we performed a sequential double immunocytochemical staining, as previously described (6Bezaire V. Mairal A. Ribet C. Lefort C. Girousse A. Jocken J. Laurencikiene J. Anesia R. Rodriguez A.M. Ryden M. Stenson B.M. Dani C. Ailhaud G. Arner P. Langin D. J. Biol.

The antibodies used were AlexaFluor-488 and -568 (A11039 and A10042, Invitrogen Molecular Probes), PLIN1 (ab3526–100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-HSL (a kind gift from Prof. Cecilia Holm), and Hoechst (33258, Invitrogen Molecular Probes). Immuno-fluorescence images were obtained with an Axio Observer.Z1 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) using a 63×/1.40 Oil Plan-Apochromat objective, Axiocam MRm camera and the AxioVision software as previously described (6Bezaire V.

At least three z-stacks after deconvolution from three different lipid droplets in three different cells were analyzed per patient. In vitro-differentiated preadipocytes were treated with targeting siRNA or non-targeting control siRNA as previously described (20Stenson B.M. Rydén M. Steffensen K.R. Wåhlén K. Pettersson A.T.

Specific siRNA against LXRα (NR1H3), LXRβ (NR1H2) or PLIN1 was obtained from Dharmacon (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool Dharmacon Inc., Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). No important off-target effects of siRNA were detected in our cell system (20Stenson B.M. Rydén M. Steffensen K.R. Wåhlén K. Pettersson A.T. Jocken J.W. Arner P. Laurencikiene J. Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 4104-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In vitro differentiated adipocytes were treated with GW3965 for 6 h, and ChIP assay was performed as previously described (33Jakobsson T. Venteclef N. Toresson G. Damdimopoulos A.E. Ehrlund A. Lou X. Sanyal S. Steffensen K.R. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 510-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The LXR antibody was a kind gift from Knut Steffensen (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden), the RXR (sc-774), Pol II (H-224, sc-9001), and IgG (sc-2027) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Quantification of the precipitated DNA regions was performed by qPCR, for primers see supplemental data. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test or Mann-Whitney test. All data are presented as means ± S.D. or S.E. N relates to number of donors. All experiments were performed in duplicates or triplicates. In vitro-differentiated human adipocytes were stimulated for 48 h with different concentrations of the LXR agonist GW3965. LXR activation up-regulated basal glycerol release into the cell culture medium in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, p < 0.05–0.001). However, cell-toxic effects were observed at the highest concentration of GW3965 (data not shown). We therefore chose to use 1 μm GW3965 in all subsequent experiments. Similar results were obtained using another LXR agonist, T0901317 (data not shown). In addition, pretreatment of in vitro differentiated human adipocytes with GW3965 for 48 h caused increased glycerol release into lipolytic medium during 3-h incubation. However, this effect was lower than the acute stimulation by the known lipolytic agent isoprenalin (Fig. 1B). The pro-lipolytic effect of GW3965 was not restricted to human adipocytes, since activation of LXR in differentiated murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in higher glycerol release as compared with control (Fig. 1C). Next the influence of fatty acid re-esterification on LXR-induced lipolysis was evaluated. In vitro-differentiated adipocytes were treated with GW3965 or vehicle for 48 h and subsequently incubated with or without the acyl-CoA synthase inhibitor Triacsin C. Although Triacsin C slightly, but not significantly, increased basal glycerol release the relative effect of the LXR agonist on lipolysis was similar with or without the re-esterification inhibitor (Fig. 1D). Shorter incubations (12–24 h) with GW3965 did not significantly affect lipolysis in human adipocytes (data not shown). We therefore hypothesized that LXR mediates its effects on lipolysis via transcriptional regulation. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of LXR on lipolysis we performed microarray analysis on RNA from in vitro-differentiated adipocytes treated with GW3965 or vehicle for 24 h. Cells from five different subjects were used. Ten different chips were analyzed for the two conditions. 293 transcripts were up-regulated and 1194 down-regulated according to SAM. The cholesterol transporters ABCG1 and ABCA1, well-established LXR-responsive genes (34Ulven S.M. Dalen K.T. Gustafsson J.A. Nebb H.I. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 2052-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were strongly up-regulated (Table 1), confirming that we obtained a proper LXR activation. SAM analysis showed that several lipolytic genes (3Lafontan M. Langin D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2009; 48: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) were regulated by LXR activation. Table 1 lists the genes that have been implicated in regulation of lipolysis (even genes with low absolute call) or genes that could be of potential importance and had an absolute call above 150 in the microarray data set. LXR activation affected the mRNA expression of several cell surface receptors, G-proteins, and regulatory proteins. Further downstream, GW3965 strongly down-regulated the gene expression of HSL (LIPE) and the lipid droplet-associated proteins PLIN1, CGI-58 (ABHD5), and CIDEC. The mRNA levels of ATGL, the adipocyte-specific gene CIDEA, the lipid droplet protein adipophilin (PLIN2) or the adipocyte differentiation marker peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG) were not regulated by LXR, according to SAM (Table 1). Taken together, SAM analysis showed that LXR affected the expression of 6.1% of all genes represented on the microarray chip and 25% of the genes involved in lipolysis regulation (p = 3 × 10−6). These findings suggested that LXR regulates human adipocyte lipolysis at the gene expression level.TABLE 1Effect of the LXR agonist GW3965 on lipolysis-related gene expressionGene groupsGene symbolAbsolute call in untreated cellsFold-changeRegulated by LXR activation (SAM)Receptorsβ-adrenergic receptorsADRB11721.10ADRB2771.15ADRB3511.03α-adrenergic receptorsADRA2A2280.72YesADRA2B1960.90ADRA2C2631.01ADORA1880.95Natriuretic peptide receptorsNPR-A2780.79NPR-C430.96G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)GPR811120.59GPR109A3400.3YesGPR109B2060.27YesNPFFR2 (GPR74)461.02Other receptorsEP-3R1840.47YesNPY-R1501.17INSR1831.13IGF-1R811.01TNFAR501.11EDNRA401.72YesIL-6R1031.21G-proteinsGα inhibitoryGNAI11710.72YesGNAI28511.03GNAI34320.95Gα stimulatoryGNAT11491.01GNAT21320.89GβGNB117540.96GNB22621.05GγGNG21730.42YesGNG11901.59YesGNG54021.36GNG129601.06GNG104630.84GNG71640.97Adenylyl cyclasesADCY12851.01ADCY32491.63YesADCY64070.89PhosphodiesterasePDE3B6440.63PKAPRKAR2B12930.47YesPRKAR2A5710.83PRKAA25520.91PRKAR1A18270.97PRKAA13570.92PKGPRKG1991.12PRKG2610.61YesLipasesLIPE (HSL)16040.50YesATGL16570.76MGL6730.95Lipid-binding and lipid droplet-associated proteinsPLIN1 (PLIN)18050.40YesPLIN2 (ADRP)34321.29PLIN3 (TIP47)4031.19CIDEC14160.40YesCIDEA470.85CAV113170.54YesFABP4 (aP2)58770.83ABHD5 (CGI-58)5110.56YesAQP711730.82MiscellaneousPPARG10011.01ABCG1706.6YesABCA18452.5YesSREBP17501.57Yes Open table in a new tab To confirm the results from the microarray analysis and try to elucidate if the effect of LXR on lipolytic gene expression is direct, we performed qRT-PCR measurements on samples from adipocytes treated with GW3965 or vehicle for 6, 12, or 24 h. We chose to investigate PLIN1, HSL, CIDEC, and CGI-58 because their role in regulation of basal adipocyte lipolysis is well documented (3Lafontan M. Langin D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2009; 48: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In accordance with the microarray data, the mRNA levels of HSL, CIDEC, and CGI-58 were significantly down-regulated by GW3965 already 6 h after stimulation (Fig. 2A, p < 0.05–0.001), suggesting a direct effect of LXR on transcriptional regulation. PLIN1 mRNA levels were slightly down-regulated after 6 h and reached significance after 12 h of treatment. The levels of ABCG1 mRNA were strongly increased (data not shown) at 6 h of stimulation while expression of PPARγ was not affected (Fig. 2A). Another LXR agonist (T091317) caused similar effect on PLIN1, HSL, and CGI-58 expression (data not shown). Next we examined if the effects at mRNA level caused by LXR activation corresponded to changes in protein expression. Differentiated adipocytes were treated with GW3965 for 48 h and protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. Activation of LXR caused a significant decrease of HSL, PLIN1, and CIDEC expression, corroborating the findings at the mRNA level (Fig. 2, B and C). Expression of PLIN1 was most pronouncedly suppressed by 78% (p < 0.001). In contrast to the finding at mRNA level, the protein expression of CGI-58 was not affected by the LXR agonist (Fig. 2D). LXR activation did not affect the expression of ATGL, and the effect on CIDEC protein expression was only marginal (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Therefore, we chose to focus further on the involvement of PLIN1 and HSL in the LXR-mediated up-regulation of basal lipolysis. It is well established that adipocyte lipolysis is not only regulated by the expression of lipolytic proteins, but also by their intracellular localization (9Moore H.P. Silver R.B. Mottillo E.P. Bernlohr D.A. Granneman J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43109-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the intracellular localization of HSL and PLIN1 in GW3965-treated cells by immunocytochemistry. In control cells, PLIN1 was distributed evenly around the lipid droplets while staining representing HSL around the lipid droplets was low. After stimulation with GW3965, PLIN1 staining around the lipid droplets was decreased and appeared more fragmented (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, HSL staining showed a dotted pattern, which could represent protein aggregation. By quantifying the total number of positive pixels along the perimeter of the lipid droplets, we found that the presence of PLIN1 around the droplet was significantly lower in GW3965-treated cells (Fig. 3C, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the ratio of HSL/PLIN1 was significantly increased in cells stimulated by LXR agonist compared with control (Fig. 3D, p < 0.05). This indicated that LXR activation induced alterations at the lipid droplet surface and suggested that HSL might be activated. To investigate the effects on the activation of HSL, we treated differentiated adipocytes with GW3965 for 48 h and performed Western blot with antibodies directed against HSL phosphorylation sites known to affect lipase activity (3Lafontan M. Langin D. Prog. Lipid Res. 2009; 48: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 35Krintel C. Osmark P. Larsen M.R. Resjö S. Logan D.T. Holm C. PloS. one. 2008; 3: e3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We observed that the phosphorylated forms of HSL were down-regulated by GW3965 to the same extent as total HSL protein (Fig. 4A) and amount of phosphorylated HSL per total HSL was not changed (data not shown) by GW3965 treatment. These findings suggested that GW3965 affected HSL protein expression but not phosphorylation. To investigate the functional consequence of HSL down-regulation, glycerol release was measured in GW3965-pretreated adipocytes in the presence or absence of the specific HSL inhibitor BAY. Cells treated with GW3965 showed up-regulated lipolysis similar to the effect demonstrated in Fig. 1A. In cells treated with the HSL inhibitor, the effect of the LXR agonist on glycerol release was abolished, and the level of released glycerol was similar to that of control cells (Fig. 4A, p < 0.05). This implied that the LXR effect on basal lipolysis was dependent on HSL activity. Because our data indicated that LXR did not affect HSL phosphorylation, we hypothesized that down-regulation of PLIN1 might be the major event in the LXR-mediated lipolysis up-regulation. Therefore, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of PLIN1 in in vitro-differentiated human adipocytes. Analysis of mRNA and protein expression in cells treated with siRNA showed an effici"

The latter is down-regulated in a variety of cancers and has capacity to inhibit tumorigenesis when expressed in cell lines derived from gastric cancer (AGS and AZ-521) as well as non-small-cell lung cancer (H1299) and kidney (HEK293) (11Lai, R.

Consistent with this interaction, the ectopic expression of SOCS6 in a Ba/F3-KIT cell line caused a 40% decrease in SCF-dependent cell proliferation and a similar reduction in signaling through ERK1, ERK2, and p38 (12Bayle J.

SOCS family proteins (SOCS1–7, CISH) share a conserved domain architecture, comprising a variable N terminus, a central SH2 domain, and a C-terminal SOCS box. A number of mechanisms have been described for inhibitory SOCS actions. Interactions mediated by the N-terminal or SH2 domains can provide kinase inhibitory activity or competitively inhibit substrate binding by other SH2-containing adapter proteins leading to attenuation of signaling (13Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The SOCS box can also assemble into elongin B/C-containing E3 ligases and mediate degradation of substrate proteins (14Kile B.T. Schulman B.A. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Martin H.M. Hilton D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 235-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This has been demonstrated for SOCS6, which negatively regulates T cell activation by promoting proteasomal degradation of p56LCK in vivo (15Choi Y.B. Son M. Park M. Shin J. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7271-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this case the SH2 domain of SOCS6 was dispensable for the interaction with active LCK, which was instead mediated by a distal region in the N-terminal domain that contains no discernible phosphoprotein binding domain (15Choi Y.B. Son M. Park M. Shin J. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7271-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To further define the mechanisms underlying SOCS6 regulation of c-KIT and to confirm the interaction of the human proteins, we analyzed the contribution of different SOCS6 domains to its binding and inhibitory activity. In addition, we determined the crystal structure and affinity of the SOCS6/c-KIT substrate complex in vitro. Our analysis shows that the SOCS6 SH2 domain is essential for the interaction with c-KIT, while the SOCS box interaction with elongin B/C contributes to SOCS6 stability. Moreover, we demonstrate that SOCS6 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for c-KIT in vitro and modulates its stability in vivo. The structure of SOCS6 reveals a highly complementary and specific interface for the bound c-KIT ligand. The determined high affinity is explained by the extension of the SH2 pocket to the pY+6 position and an elongated BG loop, which encloses the peptide adding significantly to the substrate interaction. Together our findings support the proposed role for SOCS6 as a feedback inhibitor of SCF-dependent signaling. To construct the pFlag-SOCS6 plasmid, DNA fragments encoding human SOCS6 (Uniprot ID: O14544) were amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Burlington, Canada). The following primers were used; CATGAATTCTAAGAAAATTAGTCTTAAAACCTT and CAGGATCCTCAGTAGTGCTTCTCCTGTA. The restriction sites used for cloning are underlined. The PCR fragment was then inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pFlag-CMV2 vector (Sigma-Aldrich). The site-directed mutagenesis used to create the R409E and C504F mutants was carried out with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Insert and mutant sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HA-tagged ubiquitin expression vector has been described (16Lerner M. Corcoran M. Cepeda D. Nielsen M.L. Zubarev R. Pontén F. Uhlén M.

HEK293T were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin (Invitrogen). DNA plasmid transfections were carried as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions on 70–80% confluent cells using Superfect reagent (Qiagen). Cells were serum-starved overnight 24 h after transfection in 0.5% FBS medium and then stimulated for 7 min with 150 ng/ml human SCF (ProSpec, Tany, Rehovot, Israel). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-β-actin, anti-c-Myc, anti-elongin B, and IgG horseradish peroxidase antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

To immunoprecipitate c-KIT, clarified whole cell lysates (WCL) were mixed for 18 h with 1 μg of antibody and a bed volume of 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The immunoprecipitates (IPs) were washed three times with lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1× mixture inhibitor (Roche, Penzberg, Germany), 20 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μm MG132, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)) and dissolved in SDS sample buffer.

The equilibrated IPs were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of HEB buffer containing 1 μg of E1 (human recombinant His-tagged, Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.), 1.5 μg of E2 (UbcH5b, Enzo, Life Sciences, Inc.), 16 μm ubiquitin, 5 μm HA-ubiquitin, 0.8 mm ATP, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 25 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.03 ng of rabbit skeletal muscle creatine kinase (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Aliquots of the reactions were then stopped by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. In a parallel set of experiments, the in vitro ubiquitination reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA (20 mm final concentration), followed by elution in HEB buffer containing 100 μg/ml Flag peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples containing the soluble SOCS6-containing complexes were recovered after centrifugation (500g, 2 min) followed by overnight c-KIT immunoprecipitation using 1 μg of antibody per sample. HEK293T were transfected with elongin B/C and HA-ubiquitin. After overnight starvation with 0.5% FBS, cells were treated with 150 ng/ml SCF for 10 min. After SCF stimulation, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1× mixture inhibitor, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μm MG132). Aliquots of whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation of c-KIT followed by Western blot for HA-tagged ubiquitin. HEK293T cells were transfected with pFlag-SOCS6 and elongin B/C. After 24 h post-transfection, cells were split into different plates for different treatments. Cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min and then lysed at different time points. The ESS and SH2 domains of human SOCS6 (amino acids 361–499) were cloned into the vector pNIC-Bsa4 by ligation-independent cloning (LIC). DNA sequencing identified two amino acids changes (V368D, R463G) most likely introduced by PCR error; both positions were solvent exposed in the SOCS6 structure. Protein was expressed at 18 °C in BL21 (DE3) cells. Harvested cells were buffered in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm TCEP, and lysed by sonication. An initial purification was performed using nickel affinity and size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex S75 column. For a final clean up step SOCS6 protein was passed through a Source15Q anion-exchange column buffered in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5 and collected in the flow-through. The N-terminal hexahistidine tag was cleaved using TEV protease and the expected molecular weight confirmed by LC-ESI mass spectrometry. The buffer was adjusted to 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm l-arginine, 50 mm l-glutamate for crystallization. Experiments were performed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT at 20 °C, injecting 250 μm peptide solution into 20 μm protein solution. Blank titrations were subtracted from binding data, and data were processed using ORIGIN software provided with the instrument. The pY568 peptide comprised human c-KIT residues 564–574 (NGNNpYVYIDPT) and was synthesized by ThermoScientific. The pY936 peptide comprised human c-KIT residues 932–942 (TNHIpYSNLANC) and was synthesized by Genscript. The SPOT peptide array representing phosphotyrosine sites in the c-KIT and PDGFR receptor tyrosine kinases was synthesized on a functionalized cellulose membrane using an Auto-Spot ASP 222 Robot (Abimed). The SPOT membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. Purified recombinant GST-SOCS6-SH2 or GST was added directly in the blocking buffer to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml protein and incubated with the membrane at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then washed 3 × 5 min with TBST before a rabbit anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added. The membrane was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min prior to 3 × 5-min washes with TBST. A goat anti-rabbit GST-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was then added and incubated with the membrane for another 30 min. After final 3 × 5-min washes in TBST, the SPOT membrane was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by densitometry. SOCS6 protein was concentrated to 13.6 mg/ml in the presence of a molar excess of c-KIT pY568 peptide (NGNNpYVYIDPT). A further 2 mm peptide was added to the final sample. Crystals were grown from sitting drops comprising 50 nl of SOCS6-peptide complex and 100 nl of reservoir solution (0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 30% (w/v) PEG 5000 monomethylether, 0.1 m MES pH 6.5) at 4 °C. Large plates appeared within 3 days. Crystals were transferred briefly to reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol prior to vitrification in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K on beamline X10SA at the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland). Data were recorded to a nominal resolution of 1.4 Å using a MAR225 CCD detector. Data were indexed, integrated, and reduced using MOSFLM (18Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2006; 62: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) and SCALA (19Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3793) Google Scholar). The crystals were orthorhombic and based on unit cell volume and symmetry, each asymmetric unit was predicted to contain a single SOCS6-peptide complex giving rise to a Matthews coefficient of 2.04 and a solvent content of 40%. Initial phase estimates were obtained by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (20McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J.

Initial electron density maps clearly showed the presence of the c-KIT phosphopeptide. Model building was carried out manually with COOT (21Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr D. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17654) Google Scholar) interspersed with cycles of restrained refinement with REFMAC5 (5.3.0040) (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar) using TLS (translation-libration-screw) and isotropic B-factor refinement. In the final stages, full anisotropic temperature factor refinement was used. All data to 1.4 Å were used for refinement apart from the final cycle where the resolution was truncated to 1.45 Å (the quoted resolution of the structure based on data completeness according to in-house criteria).

Open table in a new tab The final model comprises residues Val-361 to Ser-363 and Ser-317 to Gln-496 of SOCS6, the Asn-566 to Thr-574 of the c-KIT pY568 phosphopeptide, a single ethylene glycol, and 129 water molecules. SOCS6 residues Ser-364—Thr-370 and three residues at the C terminus (497–499) have poorly defined electron density and have not been included in the model. The final model has excellent stereochemistry and geometry as adjudged by the MOLPROBITY server. The figures were prepared using ICM-PRO (23Abagyan R.A. Totrov M. Kuznetsov D. J Comp Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). The role of SOCS6 as a negative regulator of SCF/c-KIT signaling has been previously demonstrated (12Bayle J. Letard S. Frank R. Dubreuil P. De Sepulveda P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12249-12259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To better characterize the molecular basis for these actions, we generated Flag-tagged SOCS6 variants with point mutations disrupting protein-protein interactions in the SOCS box (C504F) and in the SH2 domain (R409E) and expressed them in HEK293T, a cell line that endogenously expresses the c-KIT tyrosine kinase receptor. The conserved SOCS6 residue Cys-504 is located within the SOCS box, and its mutation to phenylalanine disrupts elongin C interaction (24Kamura T. Burian D. Yan Q. Schmidt S.L. Lane W.S. Querido E. Branton P.E. Shilatifard A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29748-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). SOCS6 Arg-409 is a conserved residue within the phosphotyrosine binding SH2 domain and contributes significantly to phosphotyrosine binding (25Bullock A. Debreczeni J.E. Edwards A.M. Sundström M. Knapp S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7637-7642Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, co-expression of SOCS6 with elongin C and B resulted in the stable expression of SOCS6. In contrast, cells transfected with a SOCS6-C504F expression vector failed to express the SOCS6 variant at detectable levels. The expression of SOCS6-R409E was also reduced relative to wild type (WT). Given the dramatic effect of the C504F mutation, which lies in the interface between the SOCS box and elongin C (25Bullock A. Debreczeni J.E. Edwards A.M. Sundström M. Knapp S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7637-7642Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Bullock A.N. Rodriguez M.C. Debreczeni J.E. Songyang Z. Knapp S. Structure. 2007; 15: 1493-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we tested the influence of elongin C and B expression on the levels of SOCS6. Co-expression of elongin C and B with SOCS6 resulted in significantly higher expression of both SOCS6-WT and SOCS6-R409E, indicating that the interactions with elongin C/B contributed to the stability of exogenously expressed SOCS6. To further substantiate this finding, we used cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments to measure SOCS6 protein half-life (Fig. 1B) and found that co-expression with elongin C and elongin B results in significant reduction of SOCS6 turnover, confirming the elongin contribution to SOCS6 stability. We next analyzed the contribution of the SH2 domain to the interaction with c-KIT. As shown in Fig. 2A, the binding of c-KIT to SOCS6-WT was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and was significantly enhanced upon SCF stimulation concomitant with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-KIT receptor. In contrast, no association was observed between c-KIT and the SOCS6-R409E variant, despite the fact that similar amounts of SOCS6 and SOCS6-R409E were immunoprecipitated. The SOCS6-R409E protein also showed a significantly reduced expression level concomitant to a diminished association with elongin C and B (perhaps reflecting some local structural perturbation). Thereby, confirming that interactions with elongins C/B contribute to the stability of SOCS6. Interestingly, the SOCS6-R409E protein retained its ability to interact with cullin 5, which is known to bind SOCS family members through a motif located C-terminal to the elongin C-interacting motif (27Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and functions to link SOCS with the E2 ubiquitin conjugation system. Consequently, cullin5 is essential for the activity of the Elongin/Cullin/SOCS (ECS) family of ubiquitin ligases. Subsequently, we analyzed whether SOCS6 inhibitory actions on c-KIT signaling (12Bayle J. Letard S. Frank R. Dubreuil P. De Sepulveda P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12249-12259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are due to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. To explore this hypothesis we first tested SOCS6 activity using an in vitro ubiquitination assay: Flag-tagged SOCS6 as well as the SOCS6-R409E mutant were expressed in HEK293T cells, immunoprecipitated, and mixed with recombinant E1, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH7, HA-tagged ubiquitin and an ATP-regenerating system. Ubiquitin ligase activity was monitored by the appearance of high molecular weight poly-HA-ubiquitin conjugates. As shown in Fig. 2B (middle panel), the inclusion of SOCS6 dramatically increased the ubiquitin ligase activity. This activity was dependent on the presence of the E1 and E2 enzymes as well as ATP. As expected, negative controls in the absence of HA-ubiquitin showed no signal. Having demonstrated SOCS6-associated ubiquitin ligase activity, we also addressed whether c-KIT was ubiquitinated by SOCS6 (Fig. 2B, upper panel). c-KIT was immunopurified from the in vitro ubiquitination reactions, and its ubiquitination status was probed by Western blotting with antibodies against HA-ubiquitin. The results clearly demonstrated dose-dependent ubiquitination of c-KIT in the presence of SOCS6. A control, using the SOCS6-R409E mutant confirmed the reduced ability of the SH2 mutant to associate with c-KIT and consequently a marked reduction in the ubiquitination of c-KIT by this SOCS6 variant. Interestingly, reduced ubiquitination of c-KIT by the SOCS6-R409E mutant cannot be attributed to reduced intrinsic E3 ligase activity of the mutant because SOCS6-R409E showed comparable activity to SOCS6-WT, in line with its capacity to associate with cullin5. This finding is consistent with the ability of SOCS6 to mediate ubiquitination of interacting proteins independently of its SH2 domain as demonstrated for the SOCS6 degradation of tyrosine kinase LCK (15Choi Y.B. Son M. Park M. Shin J. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7271-7280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in cellular model systems, where the expression of SOCS6 increased SCF-stimulated ubiquitination (Fig. 2C), although significant ubiquitination was also observed in control cells, probably through the actions of endogenous ubiquitin ligases. Critically, cells expressing SOCS6 also showed a reduced half-life of endogenous c-KIT as measured in CHX chase experiments (Fig. 2D). Having shown the importance of the human SOCS6 SH2 domain to the interaction with c-KIT we proceeded to analyze this interface in detail. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements showed submicromolar binding of SOCS6 to a phosphopeptide derived from the c-KIT juxtamembrane region, pY568 (Kd = 0.3 μm) (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the binding was characterized by low enthalpy, but strongly favorable entropy, perhaps as a result of dehydration upon binding. No discernable interaction was observed for SOCS6 binding to a C-terminal site encompassing c-KIT pY936 (Kd > 10 μm, data not shown). To understand the structural basis for the high affinity juxtamembrane interaction, we crystallized the SOCS6 SH2 domain in complex with the c-KIT pY568 peptide. Crystals were obtained in space group P212121 with one SOCS6-peptide complex per asymmetric unit. The determined structure, refined to 1.45 Å resolution, comprised the N-terminal extended SH2 subdomain (ESS residues 371–383) as well as the SH2 domain (residues 384–496). Crystal contacts allowed five additional N-terminal residues to be defined (two remaining from the hexahistidine tag and SOCS6 361–363). At the SH2 C terminus three linker residues were located that would connect to the SOCS box in the intact protein. The bound peptide (human c-KIT residues 564–574; NGNNpYVYIDPT) was extremely well defined in the electron density maps except for the two N-terminal positions (see Table 1 for data collection and refinement statistics). Overall, SOCS6 adopts the canonical SH2 fold (Fig. 3, B and C). The accompanying N-terminal ESS helix is, however, an unique feature of the SOCS family packing below the BC and DE loops. Although annotated originally only in the SOCS1–3/CISH subfamily, secondary structure predictions suggest that this motif is present also in SOCS4–7, and this is now confirmed experimentally in the SOCS4 (26Bullock A.N. Rodriguez M.C. Debreczeni J."
https://openalex.org/W1970692951,"LIS1 and NDEL1 are known to be essential for the activity of cytoplasmic dynein in living cells. We previously reported that LIS1 and NDEL1 directly regulated the motility of cytoplasmic dynein in an in vitro motility assay. LIS1 suppressed dynein motility and inhibited the translocation of microtubules (MTs), while NDEL1 dissociated dynein from MTs and restored dynein motility following suppression by LIS1. However, the molecular mechanisms and detailed interactions of dynein, LIS1, and NDEL1 remain unknown. In this study, we dissected the regulatory effects of LIS1 and NDEL1 on dynein motility using full-length or truncated recombinant fragments of LIS1 or NDEL1. The C-terminal fragment of NDEL1 dissociated dynein from MTs, whereas its N-terminal fragment restored dynein motility following suppression by LIS1, demonstrating that the two functions of NDEL1 localize to different parts of the NDEL1 molecule, and that restoration from LIS1 suppression is caused by the binding of NDEL1 to LIS1, rather than to dynein. The truncated monomeric form of LIS1 had little effect on dynein motility, but an artificial dimer of truncated LIS1 suppressed dynein motility, which was restored by the N-terminal fragment of NDEL1. This suggests that LIS1 dimerization is essential for its regulatory function. These results shed light on the molecular interactions between dynein, LIS1, and NDEL1, and the mechanisms of cytoplasmic dynein regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2024177986,"Cross-talk between Gα(i)- and Gα(q)-linked G-protein-coupled receptors yields synergistic Ca(2+) responses in a variety of cell types. Prior studies have shown that synergistic Ca(2+) responses from macrophage G-protein-coupled receptors are primarily dependent on phospholipase Cβ3 (PLCβ3), with a possible contribution of PLCβ2, whereas signaling through PLCβ4 interferes with synergy. We here show that synergy can be induced by the combination of Gβγ and Gα(q) activation of a single PLCβ isoform. Synergy was absent in macrophages lacking both PLCβ2 and PLCβ3, but it was fully reconstituted following transduction with PLCβ3 alone. Mechanisms of PLCβ-mediated synergy were further explored in NIH-3T3 cells, which express little if any PLCβ2. RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous PLCβs demonstrated that synergy in these cells was dependent on PLCβ3, but PLCβ1 and PLCβ4 did not contribute, and overexpression of either isoform inhibited Ca(2+) synergy. When synergy was blocked by RNAi of endogenous PLCβ3, it could be reconstituted by expression of either human PLCβ3 or mouse PLCβ2. In contrast, it could not be reconstituted by human PLCβ3 with a mutation of the Y box, which disrupted activation by Gβγ, and it was only partially restored by human PLCβ3 with a mutation of the C terminus, which partly disrupted activation by Gα(q). Thus, both Gβγ and Gα(q) contribute to activation of PLCβ3 in cells for Ca(2+) synergy. We conclude that Ca(2+) synergy between Gα(i)-coupled and Gα(q)-coupled receptors requires the direct action of both Gβγ and Gα(q) on PLCβ and is mediated primarily by PLCβ3, although PLCβ2 is also competent."
https://openalex.org/W2049778688,"The acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated cation channels activated when extracellular pH declines. In rodents, the Accn2 gene encodes transcript variants ASIC1a and ASIC1b, which differ in the first third of the protein and display distinct channel properties. In humans, ACCN2 transcript variant 2 (hVariant 2) is homologous to mouse ASIC1a. In this article, we study two other human ACCN2 transcript variants. Human ACCN2 transcript variant 1 (hVariant 1) is not present in rodents and contains an additional 46 amino acids directly preceding the proposed channel gate. We report that hVariant 1 does not produce proton-gated currents under normal conditions when expressed in heterologous systems. We also describe a third human ACCN2 transcript variant (hVariant 3) that is similar to rodent ASIC1b. hVariant 3 is more abundantly expressed in dorsal root ganglion compared with brain and shows basic channel properties analogous to rodent ASIC1b. Yet, proton-gated currents from hVariant 3 are significantly more permeable to calcium than either hVariant 2 or rodent ASIC1b, which shows negligible calcium permeability. hVariant 3 also displays a small acid-dependent sustained current. Such a sustained current is particularly intriguing as ASIC1b is thought to play a role in sensory transduction in rodents. In human DRG neurons, hVariant 3 could induce sustained calcium influx in response to acidic pH and make a major contribution to acid-dependent sensations, such as pain."

https://openalex.org/W2170942278,"Mitochondria undergo continuous cycles of homotypic fusion and fission, which play an important role in controlling organelle morphology, copy number, and mitochondrial DNA maintenance. Because mitochondria cannot be generated de novo, the motility and distribution of these organelles are essential for their inheritance by daughter cells during division. Mitochondrial Rho (Miro) GTPases are outer mitochondrial membrane proteins with two GTPase domains and two EF-hand motifs, which act as receptors to regulate mitochondrial motility and inheritance. Here we report that although all of these domains are biochemically active, only the GTPase domains are required for the mitochondrial inheritance function of Gem1p (the yeast Miro ortholog). Mutations in either of the Gem1p GTPase domains completely abrogated mitochondrial inheritance, although the mutant proteins retained half the GTPase activity of the wild-type protein. Although mitochondrial inheritance was not dependent upon Ca(2+) binding by the two EF-hands of Gem1p, a functional N-terminal EF-hand I motif was critical for stable expression of Gem1p in vivo. Our results suggest that basic features of Miro protein function are conserved from yeast to humans, despite differences in the cellular machinery mediating mitochondrial distribution in these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2147237170,"The highly variable extracellular loops in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been implicated in receptor activation, the mechanism of which is poorly understood. In a random mutagenesis screen on the human adenosine A2B receptor (A2BR) using the MMY24 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain as a read-out system, we found that two residues in the first extracellular loop, a phenylalanine and an aspartic acid at positions 71 and 74, respectively, are involved in receptor activation. We subsequently performed further site-directed and site-saturation mutagenesis. These experiments revealed that the introduction of mutations at either of the identified positions results in a wide variety of receptor activation profiles, with changes in agonist potency, constitutive activity, and intrinsic activity. Radioligand binding studies showed that the changes in activation were not due to changes in receptor expression. We interpret these data in the light of the recently revealed structure of the adenosine A2AR, the closest homologue of the A2BR. The two residues are suggested to be vital in maintaining the tertiary structure of a β sheet in the extracellular domain of the A2BR. We hypothesize that deterioration of structure in the extracellular domains of GPCRs compromises overall receptor structure with profound consequences for receptor activation and constitutive activity.—Peeters, M.

The enzyme is a flavin-dependent two-component monooxygenase that consists of a reductase component and an oxygenase component (C2). C2 catalyzes the hydroxylation of HPA using oxygen and reduced FMN as co-substrates. To date, the effects of pH on the oxygenation of the two-component monooxygenases have never been reported. Here, we report the reaction kinetics of C2·FMNH− with oxygen at various pH values investigated by stopped-flow and rapid quenched-flow techniques. In the absence of HPA, the rate constant for the formation of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN (∼1.1 × 106 m−1s−1) was unaffected at pH 6.2–9.9, which indicated that the pKa of the enzyme-bound reduced FMN was less than 6.2. The rate constant for the following H2O2 elimination step increased with higher pH, which is consistent with a pKa of >9.4. In the presence of HPA, the rate constants for the formation of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN (∼4.8 × 104 m−1s−1) and the ensuing hydroxylation step (15–17 s−1) were not significantly affected by the pH. In contrast, the following steps of C4a-hydroxy-FMN dehydration to form oxidized FMN occurred through two pathways that were dependent on the pH of the reaction. One pathway, dominant at low pH, allowed the detection of a C4a-hydroxy-FMN intermediate, whereas the pathway dominant at high pH produced oxidized FMN without an apparent accumulation of the intermediate. However, both pathways efficiently catalyzed hydroxylation without generating significant amounts of wasteful H2O2 at pH 6.2–9.9. The decreased accumulation of the intermediate at higher pH was due to the greater rates of C4a-hydroxy-FMN decay caused by the abolishment of substrate inhibition in the dehydration step at high pH. p-Hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) 3-hydroxylase (HPAH) catalyzes the hydroxylation of HPA at the ortho-position to yield 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate.

In contrast, the following steps of C4a-hydroxy-FMN dehydration to form oxidized FMN occurred through two pathways that were dependent on the pH of the reaction. One pathway, dominant at low pH, allowed the detection of a C4a-hydroxy-FMN intermediate, whereas the pathway dominant at high pH produced oxidized FMN without an apparent accumulation of the intermediate. However, both pathways efficiently catalyzed hydroxylation without generating significant amounts of wasteful H2O2 at pH 6.2–9.9. The decreased accumulation of the intermediate at higher pH was due to the greater rates of C4a-hydroxy-FMN decay caused by the abolishment of substrate inhibition in the dehydration step at high pH. IntroductionFlavin-dependent monooxygenases catalyze the incorporation of a single atom of molecular oxygen into organic substrates (1van Berkel W.J. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 2Ballou D.P. Entsch B. Cole L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The enzymes have been classified into six classes according to their catalytic and structural properties. They have also been categorized into two major types according to their protein components: a single-component type, in which reduction of a flavin cofactor and oxygenation of an organic substrate occurs within the same single polypeptide chain; and a two-component type, in which each reaction occurs on separate proteins (1van Berkel W.J. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 2Ballou D.P. Entsch B. Cole L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Single-component monooxygenases have been identified since the 1960s and have been found to be involved in the aerobic metabolism of aromatic and aliphatic compounds in various organisms (2Ballou D.P.

Biotechnol. 2010; 146: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The well known prototype for single-component monooxygenases is p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (5Entsch B. Cole L.J. Ballou D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 6Palfey B.A. McDonald C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 493: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The first enzyme identified as a two-component monooxygenase was bacterial luciferase (7Gunsalus-Miguel A. Meighen E.A. Nicoli M.Z. Nealson K.H. Hastings J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 398-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, most of the two-component monooxygenases have been identified only during the past decade and have increasingly emerged as common enzymes in nature that are involved in many important reactions in various microorganisms (1van Berkel W.J.

The mechanistic challenge for these enzymes lies in their ability to control the reactivity of C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin, which is generally manifested through the active site environment. It is known that C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin can act as an electrophile or nucleophile depending on the protonation status of a terminal peroxide group (3Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Valentine J.S.

The terminal -OH of C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin is transferred as an electrophile in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, whereas the peroxide group of C4a-peroxy-flavin performs a nucleophilic attack. C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin is commonly found in monooxygenases catalyzing the hydroxylation of aromatic compounds (2Ballou D.P. Entsch B. Cole L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Studies of the PHBH reaction at various pH values have shown that the hydroxylation rate constant is greater at higher pHs because of the deprotonation of the substrate, p-hydroxybenzoate, to a phenolate form, which in turn facilitates the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction (5Entsch B. Cole L.J. Ballou D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 6Palfey B.A. McDonald C.A. Arch. Biochem.

To date, none of the two-component monooxygenases have been characterized with respect to the pH dependence of their C4a-(hydro)peroxy-flavin reactivity.p-Hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase (HPAH) from Acinetobacter baumannii catalyzes the hydroxylation of p-hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) at the ortho-position to yield 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (9Chaiyen P. Suadee C. Wilairat P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The enzyme serves as an attractive model for investigating how hydroxylation of a phenolic compound can be catalyzed by a two-component monooxygenase. It consists of a smaller reductase component (C1), which contains FMN as a cofactor, and a larger oxygenase component (C2), which has no cofactor bound and employs reduced FMN (FMNH−) as a substrate for the hydroxylation of HPA (9Chaiyen P.

Although it catalyzes a similar ortho-hydroxylation of a phenolic compound as single-component hydroxylases, the amino acid sequence (52Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Wongratana J. Suadee C. Chaiyen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1680: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the three-dimensional structure (53Alfieri A. Fersini F. Ruangchan N. Prongjit M. Chaiyen P. Mattevi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) of HPAH compared with single-component monooxygenases are significantly different (1van Berkel W.J. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The active site residues and the binding mode of HPA in C2 (Fig. 1) are completely different from those of PHBH (5Entsch B. Cole L.J. Ballou D.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The active site of C2 contains a few catalytic residues, which comprise dissociable protons. These residues are in the proper vicinity to participate in the hydroxylation reaction. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the effects of pH on C2 hydroxylation.In addition to HPAH from A. baumannii, the structures and catalytic properties of the same enzyme from Pseudomonas putida (54Arunachalam U.

Chem. 2007; 282: 33107-33117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have been reported. Interestingly, HPAHs from all of these species display a certain degree of variation. The size of C1 is about twice those of other flavin reductases, and it contains an additional C-terminal regulatory domain (52Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Wongratana J. Suadee C. Chaiyen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1680: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 58Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10434-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of C2 is different from other HPAH oxygenases, as C2 can use FMNH− and FADH− equally well (39Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17044-17053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 52Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Wongratana J. Suadee C. Chaiyen P. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 372-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 55Galán B. Díaz E. Prieto M.A. García J.L. J.

A comparison of the structures of C2 and the oxygenase from T. thermophilus HB8 (HpaB) indicates an extra β5–β6 loop in T. thermophilus HpaB, which facilitates the preferential binding for FADH− instead of FMNH− (40Chakraborty S.

Although the overall structures of C2 and HpaB from T. thermophilus share the same folding of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily, the catalytic residues at the active sites of C2, HpaB, and the oxygenase from P. aeruginosa (HpaA) are different (40Chakraborty S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 33107-33117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These differences indicate that there are different mechanistic details among these enzymes. A previous report has shown that the binding of C2 to FMNH− is rapid (>107 m−1s−1) (39Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17044-17053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), enabling efficient transfer of FMNH− from C1 to C2 via diffusion without requiring a protein-protein interaction between the two proteins (59Sucharitakul J. Phongsak T. Entsch B. Svasti J. Chaiyen P. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8611-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the kinetic mechanism of HpaA and the reduced flavin transfer from HpaC (the reductase) to HpaA are different from those of the C1-C2 system (40Chakraborty S. Ortiz-Maldonado M. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 372-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).With the available knowledge of kinetics and structures of C2, this enzyme serves as a good model for investigating the effects of pH on the reactivity of C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin. In this report, the reactions of C2·FMNH− with oxygen in the presence and absence of HPA at various pH values were investigated using stopped-flow and rapid quenched-flow techniques. These results demonstrate that the hydroxylation by C2 is unaffected by variations in pH from 6 to 10 in terms of the hydroxylation rate constant and product formation. These results also imply that the optimal interactions among HPA, C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN, and the active site residues are achieved throughout this pH range to allow for effective hydroxylation.DISCUSSIONOur report elucidates the kinetics of C2·FMNH− with oxygen at various pH values and demonstrates that the hydroxylation by C2 is highly efficient. The kinetics of C2 reactions in the absence and presence of HPA, at various pH values, provided insight into nature and catalytic properties of the C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin intermediate of this enzyme. In the absence of HPA, C2 formed C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN, which eliminated H2O2 to generate oxidized FMN (Fig. 3). The intermediate was more stable at lower pHs because a rate constant for H2O2 elimination increased when the pH was increased. The plot of the observed rate constants versus pH (Fig. 2C) was consistent with a pKa of >9.4, indicating that the H2O2 elimination process occurred faster at higher pHs. This pKa may be due to the deprotonation of the flavin N5 proton to initiate H2O2 elimination or to the residue acting as a general base to abstract the flavin N5 proton. According to NMR measurements, the pKa of the N5 proton of free reduced FMN was estimated at >20 (60Macheroux P. Ghisla S. Sanner C. Rüterjans H. Müller F. BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The pKa of the N5-H of C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin is expected to be at least 3–4 units below the pKa value of the N5-H of reduced flavin because the C4a-hydroperoxy flavin is neutral, not anionic as in the reduced flavin (61Merényi G. Lind J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 3146-3153Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Merényi and Lind (61Merényi G. Lind J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 3146-3153Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) estimated a pKa value for the N5 proton of C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin to be less than 17. When a pKa associated with the H2O2 elimination from C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin is considered, other factors must be taken into account. It can be envisaged that the change of flavin N5 hybridization upon elimination of H2O2 can favor the deprotonation of flavin N5-H. Rate constants of H2O2 elimination from 5-alkylated-C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin synthesized from pulse radiolysis were measured at various pHs and found to be consistent with a pKa of >10 (61Merényi G. Lind J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 3146-3153Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we propose that the pKa of >9.4 observed with H2O2 elimination from C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) is largely associated with a pKa of the flavin N5-H.It should be noted that, in theory, the terminal hydroperoxide group of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN may have a pKa of ∼9.4. The pKa of H2O2 is ∼11.8 (62Evans M.G. Uri N. Trans. Faraday Soc. 1949; 45: 224-230Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas the pKa of a flavin C4a-hydroperoxide can be significantly different from this value, depending on the enzyme active site environment. On the basis of the results obtained from studying flavin model compounds, a pKa of free flavin C4a-hydroperoxide was estimated to be ∼9.2 (63Eberlein G. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6685-6697Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the deprotonation of a terminal hydroperoxide group disfavors H2O2 elimination, because hydroperoxide is a better leaving group. Therefore, the higher rate constant of the H2O2 elimination step observed at higher pHs (Fig. 2) should not be due to deprotonation of the hydroperoxide group. In addition, results from the product analysis (Table 1) also indicate that the terminal hydroperoxide group of C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN remains protonated, as the hydroxylation is efficient throughout this pH range (see more below). Therefore, it is unlikely that the pKa of >9.4 in Fig. 2 belongs to the deprotonation of flavin C4a-hydroperoxide.C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin, found in the C2 reaction in the absence of HPA, was relatively stable at neutral pH, because the rate constant for this intermediate decay was 0.003 s−1, which is equivalent to a half-life of ∼231 s at pH 7.0. The slow elimination of H2O2 from the C4a-hydroperoxy-FMN intermediate in C2 provides another means of preventing wasteful H2O2 generation in the absence of HPA in addition to the regulation by HPA-stimulated activity of the C1 component (58Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10434-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 59Sucharitakul J. Phongsak T. Entsch B. Svasti J. Chaiyen P. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8611-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For the reaction of HpaA from P. aeruginosa in the absence of HPA, C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin forms with a bimolecular rate constant of 3 × 105 m−1s−1 and decays with a rate constant of 0.005 s−1. It is thought that at low concentrations of HPA, the majority of in vivo HpaA exists in the form of C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD (40Chakraborty S. Ortiz-Maldonado M. Entsch B. Ballou D.P. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 372-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The same scenario is also applicable for the C1-C2 reaction, as the H2O2 elimination step (rate constant of 0.003 s−1) is the slowest step in the overall reaction of C1 and C2 in the absence of HPA (39Sucharitakul J.

C4a-hydroperoxy-flavin is also generally stable in the other two-component monooxygenases, such as in the reaction of bacterial luciferase where the rate constant for the H2O2 elimination is 0."

The placement of the azide corroborates the observed γ-meso specificity for the heme degradation reaction, in contrast to most known HOs that have α-meso specificity.

The typical reaction mixture for the production of polyprenyl-P-d-[3H]GalNAc from UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc by M. smegmatis membranes contained 0.5 μCi of UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc (specific activity 20 Ci mmol−1; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm NADH, membrane fraction (0.5 mg of proteins), and buffer A in a final volume of 80 μl; thus, the membranes were the source of the endogenous polyprenyl-P acceptors. After incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of 1.2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH (2:1:0.05, v/v). The upper aqueous phase was discarded, and the bottom organic phase was backwashed with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:47:48). The dried organic phase was dissolved in 50 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H2O (65:25:0.5:3.6) prior to TLC analysis on aluminum-backed silica gel 60-precoated plates F254 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Purified AG (10 μg) was partially degraded by controlled acid hydrolysis (0.1 m HCl for 20 min at 110 °C), and the oligosaccharides liberated were then tagged with the fluorescent probe 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (APTS) as described earlier (25.Nigou J.

Labeled oligosaccharides were then analyzed by capillary electrophoresis monitored by laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) on a P/ACE 5000 instrument (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). Separations were performed using an uncoated fused-silica capillary column (Sigma) of 50-μm internal diameter and 40-cm effective length (47-cm total length).

Analyses were performed on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (with TOF/TOF optics, Applied Biosystems, Voyager DE-STR) in the reflectron mode. The matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 μg μl−1 in a mixture of ethanol/water (1:1, v/v)). 0.3 μl of the CE-collected oligosaccharides resuspended in 10 μl of water or TLC-extracted lipids resuspended in 10 μl CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) was mixed with 0.3 μl of the matrix solution. Mass spectra were recorded in the negative mode. The collision-induced dissociation gas type for MS/MS experiments was atmosphere, and the gas pressure was set to medium. Rv3631 (thereafter renamed ppgS) is predicted to encode a GT-A-fold glycosyltransferase (GT) (14.Berg S. Kaur D. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 35R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15.Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Annu. Rev.

Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4195) Google Scholar), to belong to the GT-2 family of inverting GTs dependent on NDP-sugars as donor substrates. Orthologs of ppgS are found in the genomes of slow growing mycobacteria including M. bovis, M. bovis BCG, M. leprae, Mycobacterium ulcerans, Mycobacterium marinum, M. avium, and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, as well as in Mycobacterium abscessus, but not in the genomes of other rapidly growing Mycobacterium species such as M. smegmatis (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, in all of the genomes analyzed, ppgS and orthologs map in close vicinity to galE1, a gene thought to encode the UDP-glucose 4-epimerase responsible for the conversion of UDP-d-Glcp to UDP-d-Galp in AG synthesis (16.Kaur D. Guerin M. Škovierová H. Brennan P.J. Jackson M. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2009; 69: 23-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). ppgS and orthologs appear to be co-transcribed with a gene potentially encoding a small membrane protein (13 kDa) of unknown function (Rv3632 in M. tuberculosis H37Rv) (supplemental Fig. S1). PpgS shares significant sequence similarities with polyprenyl-monophosphomannose synthases from various prokaryotic sources, including Ppm1 (Rv2051c) from M. tuberculosis H37Rv (24% identity, 39% similarity on a 228-amino acid overlap). To investigate the putative involvement of this GT in AG synthesis, the ppgS gene from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was disrupted by homologous recombination using the Ts/sacB method (20.Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Allelic replacement at the ppgS locus was confirmed by Southern hybridization (supplemental Fig. S2A). The mutant grew similarly to its wild-type (WT) H37Rv parent in 7H9-ADC-Tween 80 broth at 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S2B). Soluble AG was prepared from the WT and mutant strains as described previously (5.Bhamidi S. Scherman M.S. Rithner C.D. Prenni J.E. Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. McNeil M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12992-13000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the Ara/Gal ratios were determined by CE or GC upon total acid hydrolysis. No significant differences between WT and mutant strains were observed, indicating that PpgS was probably not involved in the polymerization of the arabinan or galactan domains. Because the distribution of ppgS within the Mycobacterium genus seemed to correlate with that of d-GalN on AG, we decided to probe the mutant for the presence of this substituent. To this end, a fast and sensitive CE-based methodology was first developed to facilitate the detection of this rare substituent. By analogy to the procedure that we previously developed to analyze the mannose caps of lipoarabinomannan (25.Nigou J. Vercellone A. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28.Nigou J. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B. Bounéry J.D. Herold M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23094-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we postulated that a controlled mild acid hydrolysis of AG would cleave the arabinofuranosidic bonds of the arabinan domain while preserving the pyranosidic linkage of d-GalN onto the relevant Araf unit, thereby releasing an oligosaccharide that could be detected by CE-LIF upon tagging with an APTS fluorescent probe. A typical electrophoretogram of M. tuberculosis H37Rv AG resulting from this analysis is shown in Fig. 1A. The monosaccharide region is dominated by two main peaks attributed to d-Araf-APTS (I) and d-Galp-APTS (II) arising from the hydrolysis of the arabinan and galactan domains. A third peak (III) of lower intensity was detected with a migration time matching that of a maltoheptaose-APTS, tentatively attributed to an oligosaccharide-APTS containing d-GalpN and d-Araf units. This assumption was confirmed by collecting peak III in a picopreparative CE step (26.Ludwiczak P. Brando T. Monsarrat B. Puzo G. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 2323-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and subjecting it to MALDI/MS analysis (Fig. 1B). The negative MALDI mass spectrum was dominated by a peak at m/z 882.9 attributed to deprotonated molecular ions [M−H]− that could be assigned to an APTS derivative containing two pentosyl and one hexos-aminyl units. The identity of these units as two arabinosyl and one galactosaminyl residues was revealed by CE analysis upon acid hydrolysis and labeling with APTS or fluorescein-succinimidyl ester. The exact trisaccharide sequence, d-GalN-(1→2)-α-d-Araf-(1→5)-α-d-Araf, was revealed by MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1C) showing fragment ions at m/z 721.8 (y2) and m/z 589.7 (y1) arising from the loss of anhydro-d-GalNp and anhydro-d-GalNp-Araf, and based on the described structure of AG (5.Bhamidi S.

Peak III was thus further used as a reporter peak for the presence of d-GalN on AG.FIGURE 6Proposed model for the biosynthesis of the GalN substituent of AG.

The detailed structure of a d-GalN residue modifying an arabinan chain of AG is shown. The trisaccharide moiety of compound III is in bold font. Also shown are the two predicted GT-C signature motifs of Rv3779. GT-C1 (DLD at position 86) located on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane is involved in the transfer of a mannose residue from GDP-α-d-Manp to polyprenyl phosphate (21.Scherman H. Kaur D. Pham H. Škovierová H. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6769-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); GT-C2 (DLD at position 536) is predicted to be in the last extracytoplasmic loop of the protein and to catalyze the transfer of d-GalN(Ac) onto AG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Suggestive of an involvement of PpgS in the formation of the GalN substituent of AG, peak III was noticeably absent from the electrophoretogram of H37RvΔppgS::kan but restored in the complemented mutant strain H37RvΔppgS::kan/pVVppgS. Corroborating this observation, peak III was also detected in the AG of several ppgS-expressing Mycobacterium species (M. bovis BCG, M. marinum, and M. abscessus) but, as expected, was missing from that of M. smegmatis (supplemental Fig. S3). Although PpgS shares significant sequence similarities with polyprenol-monophosphomannose synthases, no significant differences were found between the mannolipid and lipoglycan (lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan) contents of the WT and mutant strains (supplemental Fig. S4). The absence of a ppgS ortholog in M. smegmatis provided a convenient mycobacterial host for the heterologous expression and functional characterization of this gene. Transformation of mc2155 with pVVppgS, the plasmid used for complementation studies in M. tuberculosis, resulted in the production of a C-terminal His6-tagged recombinant protein of the expected size (∼26 kDa) (Fig. 2, A and B). The recombinant protein was almost exclusively found in the membrane and P60 fractions of the bacterium, suggestive of its association with membranes (supplemental Fig. S5). To optimize the chances of producing an active form of PpgS in M. smegmatis, a recombinant strain of M. smegmatis expressing ppgS in combination with Rv3632 and a control strain expressing Rv3632 alone were also constructed. In all cases, recombinant strains grew similarly to the control in liquid broth and the production of recombinant proteins of the expected sizes was confirmed (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the AG of the various recombinant strains as described above failed to reveal the presence of a d-GalNp (or N-acetyl-d-GalNp) substituent on the AG of mc2155/pVV16, mc2155/pVVppgS, mc2155/pVVRv3632, and mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632 (supplemental Fig. S6). It thus appeared that the expression of ppgS alone or in combination with Rv3632 was not sufficient for the formation of this substituent in M. smegmatis. Cell-free assays using membranes from the recombinant M. smegmatis strains were then conducted to determine whether PpgS is involved in some aspects of lipid-linked sugar biosynthesis. TLC autoradiographs clearly revealed the incorporation of d-[3H]GalNAc from UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc into two major glycolipids (A and B) by mc2155/pVVppgS membranes that were not detected in the control strain mc2155/pVV16 or in the strain expressing the only Rv3632 gene, mc2155/pVVRv3632 (Fig. 3A). Strikingly, this enzymatic activity was increased 40–50-fold in the strain co-expressing ppgS and Rv3632 (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The accumulated d-[3H]GalNAc- (or d-[3H]GalN)-containing glycolipids were mild alkali-stable and mild acid-labile (supplemental Fig. 7SA) with TLC mobility properties suggestive of lipid-linked sugars of the mycobacterial polyisoprenyl-P class (19.Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Scherman H. Kaur D. Pham H. Škovierová H. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. J.

Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Further assays aimed at testing the effects of time and protein or acceptor substrate concentration on d-[3H]GalNAc transfer by mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632 membranes showed clear enzyme and substrate concentration-dependent increases in activity (Fig. 3, B and C). Increases in activity were similar whether decaprenyl (C50)-P or the shorter heptaprenyl (C35)-P were used as acceptor substrates (Fig. 3D) but inexistent when C10-P served as the acceptor (supplemental Fig. S7B) indicative of PpgS preference for longer lipid carriers. Suggestive of PpgS specificity for the sugar transferred, assays performed under similar conditions using other sugar donors including GDP-d-[14C]Man, UDP-d-[14C]GlcNAc, ADP-d-[14C]Glc, and UDP- d-[14C]Gal failed to reveal any effect of overexpressing ppgS on the incorporation of these radiolabeled sugars into glycolipids (data not shown). To establish the nature of the products formed in the assay using mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632 membranes and UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc, a nonradioactive assay was up-scaled, and the products of the reaction, purified by preparative TLC, were submitted to MALDI/MS analyses. The negative MALDI-TOF mass spectra of purified products A and B were dominated by peaks at m/z 980.5 and 784.4, respectively, attributed to deprotonated molecular ions [M−H]− that could be assigned to C50-P-d-GalNAc and C35-P-d-GalNAc (Fig. 4, A and B). This assignment was confirmed by MS/MS analyses showing for compound A fragment ions at m/z 300.5 and 778.2, arising from the loss of the decaprenyl and N-acetylgalactosaminyl moieties, respectively (Fig. 4C). The negative MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrum of purified compound B exhibited the same reporter fragment ions at m/z 300.5 and 581.1 (Fig. 4D). Altogether, our results thus indicate that ppgS encodes a polyprenyl-phospho-N-acetylgalactosaminyl synthase required for the synthesis of the GalN substituent of AG. Because the involvement of a lipid-linked d-GalN(Ac) donor suggested that the transfer of the amino sugar onto AG occurred on the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane, we thought to search for the responsible GT among the membrane-associated GT-C enzymes of M. tuberculosis (14.Berg S. Kaur D. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 35R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Of the 17 proposed GT-Cs of strain H37Rv, only 2 are missing an ortholog in M. smegmatis mc2155 but have orthologs in M. leprae, M. abscessus, and other species harboring a d-GalNp substituent on AG, namely Rv1635c and Rv3779. Rv1635c was demonstrated earlier to catalyze the addition of the first mannose residue in the Man-capping of mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (30.Dinadayala P. Kaur D. Berg S. Amin A.G. Vissa V.D. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20027-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Rv3779 clusters on the chromosome of M. tuberculosis with genes involved in the biosynthesis of the cell wall core and was recently found to participate in the synthesis of polyprenylphosphomannose (21.Scherman H. Kaur D. Pham H. Škovierová H. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6769-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Analysis of the AG of mutants deficient in the expression of each of these genes (21.Scherman H. Kaur D. Pham H. Škovierová H. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6769-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30.Dinadayala P. Kaur D. Berg S. Amin A.G. Vissa V.D. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. Crick D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20027-20035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) revealed that although the M. tuberculosis CDC1551 Rv1635c knock-out strain still carried the d-GalNp substituent (supplemental Fig. S8A), the AG of M. tuberculosis H37RvΔRv3779 was totally devoid of it (Fig. 5). Production of galactosaminylated AG was restored in the Rv3779 mutant upon complementation with a WT copy of Rv3779 expressed from a replicative plasmid (Fig. 5). The presence of a covalently bound GalN residue typifies the AG of slow growing mycobacteria. We have identified the key components of the biosynthetic machinery required for the synthesis and transfer of this amino sugar in M. tuberculosis and provided evidence that a previously unknown mycobacterial lipid-linked sugar, polyprenyl-P-(N-acetyl)-galactosamine served as the sugar donor in this process. PpgS, a sugar nucleotide-utilizing GT, catalyzes the formation of polyprenyl (C35/C50)-P-d-GalNAc from UDP-α-d-GalNAc and polyprenyl-P on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. This sugar donor is then presumably deacylated by an as yet unknown deacetylase before or after being translocated to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane where the membrane-associated GT-C enzyme Rv3779 transfers the d-GalNp (or d-GalNAc) residue from polyprenyl-P-d-GalN(Ac) to the C2 position of a portion of the internal 3,5-branched d-Araf residues of AG (Fig. 6). The identity of the enzymes involved and deduced compartmentalization of this biosynthetic pathway are in line with what is currently known of the biogenesis of AG, whose early biosynthetic steps take place on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane whereas later stages leading to the elongation and branching of the arabinan domain occur extracytoplasmically (16.Kaur D. Guerin M. Škovierová H. Brennan P.J. Jackson M. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2009; 69: 23-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The distribution of the ppgS, Rv3632, and Rv3779 genes within the Mycobacterium genus matches the reported presence or absence of a d-GalNp substituent on the AG of the mycobacterial species analyzed to date. The identification of the PPM synthase Rv3779 (21.Scherman H. Kaur D. Pham H. Škovierová H. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6769-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as the galactosaminyltransferase (or N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) of the system indicates that this GT-C enzyme is endowed with at least two distinct enzymatic activities and highlights the complexity of the GT-C enzymes responsible for much of the biosynthesis of mycobacterial cell wall polysaccharides. Consistent with this finding, in addition to the cytoplasmic GT-C signature motif (DLD at position 86) which we proposed earlier to be involved in the transfer of a mannose residue from GDP-α-d-Manp to polyprenyl phosphate (14.Berg S. Kaur D. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 35R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 21.Scherman H. Kaur D. Pham H. Škovierová H. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6769-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a second putative GT-C motif predicted to be located in the last extracytoplasmic loop of the protein (TMHMM 2.0) and susceptible of catalyzing the transfer of d-GalN(Ac) was identified (DLD at position 536). This motif and associated downstream acidic, aromatic, and proline residues (YDYP at position 578) (14.Berg S. Kaur D. Jackson M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 35R-56RCrossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) are conserved among the Mycobacterium species reported to display a GalN-substituted AG. The predicted spatial distribution of each GT-C motif, which is in line with that of their respective donor and acceptor substrates (cytosolic GDP-Man and periplasmic arabinan chains of AG in particular), would thus govern the dual catalytic activities of Rv3779 (Fig. 6). Further experiments are under way to validate this hypothesis. Missing biosynthetic components required for producing the GalN substituent of AG include the deacetylase responsible for deacetylating polyprenyl-P-d-GalNAc to the corresponding d-GalN derivative and the translocase required for translocating polyprenyl-P-d-GalN/polyprenyl-P-d-GalNAc from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (Fig. 6). A search for the missing deacetylase of the system in the genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv led to our interest in Rv1170 (mshB) and Rv1082 (mca). MshB participates in the deacetylation of 1-d-myo-inosityl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside in the biosynthesis of mycothiols and, in vitro, displays deacetylase activity on various other acetylated substrates. The mycothiol S-conjugate amidase Mca shares with MshB sequence similarities and deacetylase activity in vitro, although its primary function in the bacterium is the cleavage of various S-conjugates of mycothiol (22.Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31.Newton G.L. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. J.

Purif. 2006; 47: 542-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Analysis of AG in the M. tuberculosis mshB and mca knock-out strains, however, revealed WT profiles in both mutants (supplemental Fig. S8B), suggesting either that these enzymes are not involved in the formation of the d-GalNp substituent or that compensatory enzymatic activities exist in the cell. With regard to the translocase of the system, studies are in progress in our laboratories to investigate whether the small integral membrane protein Rv3632 may assume this function, thereby explaining its tight functional association with PpgS. Alternatively, the role of Rv3632 may be to target PpgS to the plasma membrane as shown for GTs involved in O-polysaccharide synthesis in Gram-negative bacteria (33.Clarke B.R. Greenfield L.K. Bouwman C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30662-30672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or to stabilize PpgS in the membrane as suggested for M. smegmatis polyprenyl phosphomannose synthase Ppm1 and associated transmembrane protein Ppm2 (fused as one single polypeptide, Rv2051c, in M. tuberculosis H37Rv) (34.Baulard A.R.

The availability of a ppgS knock-out mutant of M. tuberculosis now provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the function(s) of the d-GalNp substituent of AG. Preliminary studies indicate that the mutant does not display any defects in growth or susceptibility to drugs under optimal laboratory growth conditions. Thus, it is unlikely that d-GalNp serves a critical role in stabilizing the structure of the envelope as suggested earlier (3.Draper P. Khoo K.H. Chatterjee D. Dell A. Morris H.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Instead, the relative restriction of this substituent to pathogenic slow growing mycobacterial species (and emerging nosocomial pathogen, M. abscessus) together with the reported role of the d-GalN substituent of lipid A in the pathogenicity of F. tularensis (8.Kanistanon D. Hajjar A.M. Pelletier M.R. Gallagher L.A. Kalhorn T. Shaffer S.A. Goodlett D.R. Rohmer L. Brittnacher M.J. Skerrett S.J. Ernst R.K.

https://openalex.org/W1990965894,"Cdc7-Dbf4 is a conserved, two-subunit kinase required for initiating eukaryotic DNA replication. Recent studies have shown that Cdc7-Dbf4 also regulates the mitotic exit network (MEN) and monopolar homolog orientation in meiosis I (Matos, J., Lipp, J. J., Bogdanova, A., Guillot, S., Okaz, E., Junqueira, M., Shevchenko, A., and Zachariae, W. (2008) Cell 135, 662-678 and Miller, C. T., Gabrielse, C., Chen, Y. C., and Weinreich, M. (2009) PLoS Genet. 5, e1000498). Both activities likely involve a Cdc7-Dbf4 interaction with Cdc5, the single Polo-like kinase in budding yeast. We previously showed that Dbf4 binds the Cdc5 polo-box domain (PBD) via an ∼40-residue N-terminal sequence, which lacks a PBD consensus binding site (S(pS/pT)(P/X)), and that Dbf4 inhibits Cdc5 function during mitosis. Here we identify a non-consensus PBD binding site within Dbf4 and demonstrate that the PBD-Dbf4 interaction occurs via a distinct PBD surface from that used to bind phosphoproteins. Genetic and biochemical analysis of multiple dbf4 mutants indicate that Dbf4 inhibits Cdc5 function through direct binding. Surprisingly, mutation of invariant Cdc5 residues required for binding phosphorylated substrates has little effect on yeast viability or growth rate. Instead, cdc5 mutants defective for binding phosphoproteins exhibit enhanced resistance to microtubule disruption and an increased rate of spindle elongation. This study, therefore, details the molecular nature of a new type of PBD binding and reveals that Cdc5 targeting to phosphorylated substrates likely regulates spindle dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2135719307,"We recently reported that c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is associated with adherens junctions and phosphorylates β-catenin at serine 33/37 and threonine 41. Here, we report that inhibition of JNK led to formation of adherens junctions, which was accompanied by dissociation of α-catenin from the β-catenin/E-cadherin complex and increased association of α-catenin with the cytoskeleton. Conversely, activation of JNK increased binding of α-catenin to β-catenin, which was blocked by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 or JNK siRNA. In addition, inhibition of JNK failed to lead to adherens junction formation in cells where α-catenin was absent or knocked down. Conversely, introduction of α-catenin restored the responsiveness of cells to JNK inhibition and led to cell-cell adhesion. Experiments with domain deletion mutants showed that binding of α-catenin to β-catenin was required for transport of adherens junction complexes to the cell surface, while binding to actin was required for translocation to the cell-cell contact sites. Collectively, our results suggest that JNK affects the association of α-catenin with the adherens junction complex and regulates adherens junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2143719444,"Bryostatin-1 (Bryo-1), a natural macrocyclic lactone, is clinically used as an anti-cancer agent. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that Bryo-1 acts as a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand. Interestingly, activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (in vitro with Bryo-1) led to a TLR4-dependent biphasic activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the unique induction of cytokines (IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10) and chemokines, including RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP1-α). In addition, EMSA demonstrated that Bryo-1-mediated induction of RANTES was regulated by NF-κB and the interferon regulatory factors (IRF)-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 to the RANTES independently of myeloid differentiation primary response gene-88 (MyD88). Bryo-1 was able to induce the transcriptional activation of IRF-3 through the TLR4/MD2-dependent pathway. In vivo administration of Bryo-1 triggered a TLR-4-dependent T helper cell 2 (Th2) cytokine response and expanded a subset of myeloid dendritic cells that expressed a CD11chighCD8α− CD11b+CD4+ phenotype. This study demonstrates that Bryo-1 can act as a TLR4 ligand and activate innate immunity. Moreover, the ability of Bryo-1 to trigger RANTES and MIP1-α suggests that Bryo-1 could potentially be used to prevent HIV-1 infection. Finally, induction of a Th2 response by Bryo-1 may help treat inflammatory diseases mediated by Th1 cells. Together, our studies have a major impact on the clinical use of Bryo-1 as an anti-cancer and immunopotentiating agent. Bryostatin-1 (Bryo-1), a natural macrocyclic lactone, is clinically used as an anti-cancer agent. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that Bryo-1 acts as a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand. Interestingly, activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (in vitro with Bryo-1) led to a TLR4-dependent biphasic activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the unique induction of cytokines (IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10) and chemokines, including RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP1-α). In addition, EMSA demonstrated that Bryo-1-mediated induction of RANTES was regulated by NF-κB and the interferon regulatory factors (IRF)-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 to the RANTES independently of myeloid differentiation primary response gene-88 (MyD88). Bryo-1 was able to induce the transcriptional activation of IRF-3 through the TLR4/MD2-dependent pathway. In vivo administration of Bryo-1 triggered a TLR-4-dependent T helper cell 2 (Th2) cytokine response and expanded a subset of myeloid dendritic cells that expressed a CD11chighCD8α− CD11b+CD4+ phenotype. This study demonstrates that Bryo-1 can act as a TLR4 ligand and activate innate immunity. Moreover, the ability of Bryo-1 to trigger RANTES and MIP1-α suggests that Bryo-1 could potentially be used to prevent HIV-1 infection. Finally, induction of a Th2 response by Bryo-1 may help treat inflammatory diseases mediated by Th1 cells. Together, our studies have a major impact on the clinical use of Bryo-1 as an anti-cancer and immunopotentiating agent. Activation of the innate immune response is essential to control the initial stage of pathogen invasion and for the establishment of adaptive immunity (1Montoya C.J. Jie H.B. Al-Harthi L. Mulder C.

The discrimination process leading to cell immunity or tolerance is highly regulated by pattern recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (1Montoya C.J.

Toll signaling to NF-κB occurs from the conserved Toll-IL-1 resistance (TIR) domain of TLR, which triggers the recruitment of the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein MyD88 (9Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). The recruitment of MyD88 to the activated TLR results in NF-κB activation via the MyD88 adaptor-like protein (Mal/TIRAP) (12Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A.

Although most of the TLRs seem to be exclusively dependent on the expression of MyD88 for all their functions, TLR3 and TLR4 are unique in that they are capable of activating both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent responses (9Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar, 14Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M.

Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). It has been shown that stimulation of DC maturation and the induction of type 1 interferon (IFN-β) is mediated by the MyD88-independent signaling pathway (14Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 15Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). However, whereas all TLRs activate NF-κB, not all TLRs induce IFN-β (8Wang Z.Y. Yang D. Chen Q. Leifer C.A. Segal D.M.

Therefore, TIR domain-containing adaptors such as MyD88, TRIF, and Mal/TIRAP play crucial roles in TLR-signaling pathways, because they provide specificity to the response generated by signaling through each TLR (16Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6669) Google Scholar). Bryostatin-1 (Bryo-1) is a macrocyclic lactone isolated from the marine bryozoan, Bugula neritina (17Ramsdell J.S. Pettit G.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17073-17080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The potent anti-proliferative effects and anti-neoplastic properties of Bryo-1 against various tumor cells have led to its use as a chemotherapeutic agent. Recently, Bryo-1 has received much attention because of its immunomodulatory properties, both in vitro and in vivo. Bryo-1 has been shown to be a potent activator of human macrophages (18Bosco M.C. Rottschafer S. Taylor L.S. Ortaldo J.R. Longo D.L. Espinoza-Delgado I. Blood. 1997; 89: 3402-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also to induce the production of immunomodulatory cytokines-IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α (18Bosco M.C. Rottschafer S. Taylor L.S. Ortaldo J.R. Longo D.L. Espinoza-Delgado I. Blood. 1997; 89: 3402-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also known that Bryo-1 induces the proliferation and activation of B and T cells (19Scheid C. Prendiville J. Jayson G. Crowther D. Fox B. Pettit G.R. Stern P.L. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1994; 39: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Hess A.D. Vogelsang G.B. Silanskis M. Friedman K.A. Beschorner W.E. Santos G.W. Transplant. Proc. 1988; 20: 487-492PubMed Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory have shown that Bryo-1 enhances the maturation and antigen-presenting abilities of DCs in vitro (21Do Y. Mainali E. Nagarkatti P.S. Nagarkatti M. Cell. Immunol. 2004; 231: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Bryo-1 alone or in combination with calcium ionophore could activate cord blood monocyte-derived DCs to express higher levels of MHC class II antigens, as well as the co-stimulatory molecules CD1a, CD80, CD83, and CD86. Furthermore, Bryo-1 and calcium ionophore-activated DCs were capable of inducing the proliferation of cord blood-derived alloreactive T cells and the production of IFN-γ (21Do Y. Mainali E. Nagarkatti P.S. Nagarkatti M. Cell. Immunol. 2004; 231: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which Bryo-1 exerts its biological properties on DCs is not clearly understood. In this study, we investigated the involvement of TLR4 in Bryo-1-mediated effects in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we have identified some unique properties of Bryo-1, which demonstrate that it can act as a TLR-4 ligand, thereby activating the innate immunity. Our findings are important and have major translational impact because Bryo-1 is currently being tested in humans as an anti-cancer agent. Furthermore, the ability of Bryo-1 to induce CC-chemokines, RANTES and MIP1-α, may have a major application as an inhibitor of HIV infection. Moreover, the inability of Bryo-1 to activate inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 in DCs and its property to promote a Th2 response may find its use to treat inflammatory diseases by facilitating Th1 to Th2 switch. Adult (6–8 weeks of age) female C57BL/6 (H-2b) (referred to as wild type (WT) and C57/10ScNJ (H-2b) (referred to as TLR4−/− or TLR4 KO) mice were purchased from NCI, National Institutes of Health, and The Jackson Laboratory, respectively. MyD88−/− mice were kindly provided by Dr. Wei Chao, Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston. Mice were housed in polyethylene cages and given standard animal feed and water ad libitum. Mice were housed in rooms maintaining a temperature of 23 ± 1 °C and on a 12-h light/dark cycle. HEK293 cell lines stably expressing pcDNA3, TLR3, TLR4, or both TLR4 and MD2 were gifts from D. Golenbock (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester). All cell lines were maintained in DMEM-supplemented media as described previously (11Kato H. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Matsui K. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Fujita T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Immunity. 2005; 23: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Bryostatin-1 (Biomol), LPS (Sigma), and polymyxin B sulfate (Invitrogen) were purchased and used in various in vivo and in vitro assays. The Gal4-IRF-3 and Gal4-luciferase reporter gene were a gift from T. Fujita (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan). NF-κB luciferase construct ELAM was from D. Golenbock. IFNβ-RE-luciferase reporter gene was a gift from S. Kwok (Albert Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA). LPS derived from Escherichia coli strain 011:B4 and bryostatin-1 were purchased from Sigma and Biomol, respectively. Poly(IC) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. ALL, MG132 (Calbiochem), and TAT-NBD (IKKγ NEMO binding domain) peptides were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. Murine DCs were obtained from bone marrow cells by culturing with murine recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; 5 ng/ml; Pharmingen) for 6 days, as described previously (22Do Y. Hegde V.L. Nagarkatti P.S. Nagarkatti M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6756-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours after Bryo-1 (75 μg/kg body weight, i.p.) injection, WT and TLR4−/−mice were sacrificed and spleens removed. The RBCs were lysed, and the cell numbers were adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells were labeled for various DC activation markers and analyzed for the different DC populations (myeloid, lymphoid, and plasmacytoid). Phenotypic analysis of DCs was carried out by double or triple staining with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated, allophycocyanin-conjugated, or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mAbs following incubation with Fc-block (anti-CD16/CD32 mAb; Pharmingen) to avoid nonspecific binding. The following mAbs were used: FITC-anti-CD40, PE-anti-CD80, PE-anti-CD86, allophycocyanin-anti-CD11c, FITC-anti-CD11b, FITC-anti-B220, FITC-anti-CD4, and PE-anti-CD8α (Pharmingen). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (EPICS FC500; Coulter Electronics, Miami, FL). Various cytokines and chemokines were assayed in the serum and supernatants of BMDCs from WT (TLR4+/+) and TLR4−/− mice, treated with vehicle, LPS, or Bryo-1. DCs from WT and TLR4−/− mice were treated with Byro-1 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in vitro, after which the cells were spun down and the supernatants collected. Supernatants from LPS (100 ng/ml) and vehicle-treated BMDCs were used as positive and negative controls. For serum samples, blood was drawn at 24 h after Bryo-1 (75 μg/kg body weight), and serum was separated. Vehicle treated and untreated mice were used as controls. The serum was assayed using the multiplex bead-based assays (Bio-Plex assay, Bio-Rad), designed to quantitate multiple cytokine analysis, as described previously (23Singh N.P. Hegde V.L. Hofseth L.J. Nagarkatti M. Nagarkatti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1508-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We looked at a panel of 18 cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12(p40), IL-12(p70), IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF-α, IFN-γ, KC, MIP1-α, and RANTES. The supernatants from the cultures were harvested and analyzed using ELISA kit for the production of RANTES (PeproTech Inc., NJ) and IFN-β (PBL Biomedical Laboratories, NJ). BMDCs from WT and TLR4 KO mice were obtained as described above and subsequently treated with either LPS (100 ng/ml) or Bryo-1 (10 ng/ml). At the indicated times, nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (24Fiorentino L. Stehlik C. Oliveira V. Ariza M.E. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35333-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis was performed probing for the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min at room temperature. To this mixture, 2 × 104 cpm of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (NF-κB, 5′-ATGTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; RANTES-ISRE-IRF-1-RE, 5′-ACACAAAATGGAAAACTGAAATCACCCTTGG-3′; and IFNβ-PRD III-I, 5′-GAAAACTGAAAGGGAGAAGTGAAAGTG-3′, Integrated DNA Technologies) was added (binding site is underlined) in a buffer consisting of 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12 mm Hepes-KOH, 60 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for an additional 20 min. Complexes were resolved on a nondenaturing 5% polyacylamide gel and subsequently exposed on Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). For supershifts, antibodies raised against specific subunits of NF-κB, p65, p50 (nuclear localization signal), c-Rel, and RelB, or the IRF family members, IRF-1, IRF-3 (H-246), and IRF7 (FL-425) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature before the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC). HEK293 cells (1 × 106) were seeded into 6-well plates and transiently transfected 24 h later using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen), following the recommendations of the manufacturer. For NF-κB and IFNβ reporter assays, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of either ELAM or IFN-β, respectively, and 0.1 μg of CMV-β-Gal reporter vectors. For IRF-3 reporter assay, HEK293 cells (4 × 104) were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected with 40 ng/well of the Gal4-luciferase reporter gene. At 36 h following transfection, cells were treated with Bryo-1 (50 ng/ml) and LPS (100 ng/ml) for 6 h or left untreated. Cell lysates were prepared, and reporter gene activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter system (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized for transfection efficiency and expressed as the mean relative stimulation ± S.D. To detect expression of RANTES in DCs from Myd88−/− mice, we performed intracellular staining using Cytofix/CytopermTM fixation/permeabilization kit following the recommendations of the manufacturer (BD Biosciences). Western blotting was performed using antibodies against total IRF3 and phosphorylated IRF3 (P-IRF3 Ser-396; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:1000 and β-actin at dilution of 1:5000. HRP-conjugated secondary Ab was used at 1:4000 dilution (Cell Signaling). In brief, lysates from vehicle- or Bryo-1-treated BMDCs were prepared, and protein concentration was measured using standard Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The proteins fractionated in SDS-PAGE were transferred onto PVDF membranes using a dry blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was first incubated in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation in primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was incubated for 1 h in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) in blocking buffer after washing three times (10–15 min) with washing buffer (PBS + 0.2% Tween 20). The membranes were incubated in developing solution (ECL Western blotting detection reagents, GE Healthcare), and signal was detected using ChemiDoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analyses of the Western blots were performed using ChemiDoc software (Bio-Rad). The statistical comparisons between different study groups were carried out using Student's t test and GraphPad software and differences of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Earlier studies from our laboratory have shown that Bryo-1 is capable of inducing maturation of DCs (21Do Y. Mainali E. Nagarkatti P.S. Nagarkatti M. Cell. Immunol. 2004; 231: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To determine the cytokine/chemokine profile induced by Bryo-1, immature BMDC from WT and TLR4−/− mice were treated with Bryo-1 or vehicle. Next, supernatants were evaluated for the presence of cytokines and chemokines by ELISA, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Specifically, we studied cytokines and chemokines that are induced following activation of DCs through TLRs, including IL-1α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α, IL-6, MIP1-α, KC, and RANTES. We observed that activation of BMDCs with LPS from WT mice led to significant induction of IL-12 and IL-1α as well as low levels of IFN-β (Fig. 1), and furthermore, these cytokines were dramatically reduced in LPS-activated BMDCs from TLR4 KO mice. Interestingly, Bryo-1 activated BMDCs produced little or no IL-12 and IL-1α and low levels of IFN-β. Moreover, of all the cytokines and chemokines screened, Bryo-1 activated BMDCs from wild-type mice produced only MIP1-α and RANTES (also known as CCL5) (Fig. 1). It was noted that Bryo-1-induced production of IFN-β, MIP1-α, and RANTES in DCs was significantly higher in WT BMDCs when compared with BMDCs from TLR4−/− mice, suggesting that the induction of IFN-β, MIP1-α, and RANTES by Bryo-1 was also regulated, at least in part, through TLR4 activation. Because all TLR signaling pathways culminate in the activation of NF-κB transcription factor, which in turn regulates the induction of cytokines, we investigated whether Bryo-1-induced activation of DCs involved modulation of NF-κB binding activity. To explore this possibility, nuclear extracts from Bryo-1 (10 ng/ml) or LPS (100 ng/ml)-stimulated BMDCs were prepared, and the NF-κB binding activity was examined by EMSA analysis, using a specific 32P-labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 2A, Bryo-1 induced NF-κB activation at 2 and 4 h following treatment. We used LPS-treated BMDCs as a positive control. To further evaluate the composition of the NF-κB complexes induced by Bryo-1, supershift analysis using antibodies against the NF-κB members p50, p65, c-Rel, and RelB was performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, the majority of the NF-κB complexes was composed of a p50 homodimer after a 2-h treatment with Bryo-1 and of p50/c-Rel and p50/p65 heterodimers following a longer (4 h) incubation time with Bryo-1. To determine the binding specificity of these complexes, competition analysis using a mutated NF-κB oligonucleotide was performed. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, binding of the nuclear complexes to the DNA probe was specific because Bryo-1-mediated stimulation of DNA-protein complexes was not blocked by excess of unlabeled mutated NF-κB oligonucleotide (9th lane). Competition assays using 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled DNA probe as specific competitor further demonstrated the specificity of the band corresponding to NF-κB (Fig. 2E, cold probe lane). To determine whether TLR4 was implicated in Bryo-1-mediated activation of NF-κB, we examined the ability of BMDC nuclear extracts from C57BL/6 and TLR4−/− mice to bind to the NF-κB probe in response to Bryo-1. Interestingly, we found that the NF-κB binding activity of nuclear extracts from TLR4−/− BMDCs was significantly reduced relative to that of wild-type cells suggesting that TLR4 was in fact involved in Bryo-1 signaling in BMDCs (Fig. 3). We next addressed the molecular mechanism(s) by which Bryo-1 triggers the production of RANTES by DCs. To determine whether the increased RANTES production induced by Bryo-1 is mediated by IRFs, the binding of nuclear extracts from Bryo-1 or vehicle-treated BMDCs to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the IRF-binding motif in the RANTES gene promoter was examined by EMSA analysis, as described previously (24Fiorentino L. Stehlik C. Oliveira V. Ariza M.E. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35333-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As in LPS-stimulated BMDCs, binding of nuclear extracts to the IRF motif of the RANTES promoter was observed in response to Bryo-1 treatment of BMDCs (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, supershift analysis of the IRF complexes, using antibodies against the IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-7 proteins, revealed IRF-1 as the protein bound to the RANTES promoter in both Bryo-1- and LPS-stimulated BMDCs (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, IRF-3 (Fig. 4A, 8th and 12th lanes) and IRF-7 (9th and 13th lanes) also caused a gel shift when compared with the binding activity induced by Bryo-1 in the absence of antibody (Fig. 4A, 6th and 10th lanes) at both time points (2 and 4 h) suggesting that IRF-1 and possibly IRF-3 and IRF-7 may be the modulators of Bryo-1-mediated RANTES gene expression. The promoter of the RANTES gene carries IRF and NF-κB cis-acting elements both of which may be critical for RANTES gene expression (25Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Iwabe T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 1225-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To further examine the specificity of Bryo-1-mediated increase in NF-κB binding activity, a series of proteosome inhibitors were used. Briefly, DCs were preincubated for 2 h with the NF-κB inhibitors ALL (10 μm), MG132 (1 μm), TAT-NBD peptide (200 μm), or left untreated followed by Bryo-1 treatment for 4 h. DCs were harvested for nuclear extract preparation, and the supernatant was collected for cytokine analysis by ELISA, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The nuclear extracts were examined for their ability to bind to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus sequence. In the presence of nuclear extracts from vehicle-treated BMDCs, constitutive NF-κB complex formation was observed (Fig. 5, 2nd lane). Bryo-1 treatment, however, further increased protein complex binding to the NF-κB site (Fig. 5, 4th lane). Preincubation of BMDCs with various NF-κB inhibitors resulted in a decreased DNA binding activity of nuclear extracts relative to that of Bryo-1 alone. Furthermore, the NF-κB inhibitors ALL and NBD peptide were more effective at reducing protein-DNA complex formation than MG132 under our experimental conditions. In addition, the supernatants were also collected and analyzed for the presence of RANTES by ELISA (Fig. 5B). It was noted that Bryo-1-mediated induction of the NF-κB binding activity was considerably decreased in the presence of the proteosome inhibitors, ALL, TAT-NBD peptide, and to a lesser extent MG132. In addition, preincubation of BMDCs with the NF-κB inhibitors resulted in a decrease in the amount of RANTES chemokine released into the medium (Fig. 5B), suggesting that NF-κB was involved in the production of RANTES. Altogether, these data indicated that NF-κB and IRF-1 may be involved in the induction of RANTES in BMDCs in response to Bryo-1 stimulation. TLR4 activates both the MyD88- and the TRIF-dependent pathways. To investigate further the role of MyD88, immature BMDCs from WT and MyD88-deficient mice were cultured with Bryo-1 and analyzed for intracellular RANTES induction. The data indicated that BMDCs from MyD88 KO mice produced significant levels of RANTES comparable with the WT mice thereby suggesting that Bryo-1-induced RANTES production was independent of MyD88 (Fig. 6). These data were also consistent with the above observation that RANTES induction by Bryo-1 involved IRFs whose activation is independent of MyD88. There is increasing evidence that supports a key role for DCs in the production of type I interferons and the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses (26Honda K. Yanai H. Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 27Tailor P. Tamura T. Ozato K. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We noted that activation of DCs with Bryo-1 failed to induce a majority of the cytokines characteristic of DCs except low levels of IFN-β. To further corroborate the role played by TLR-4 in the induction of IFN-β by Bryo-1, EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts from Bryo-1 (10 ng/ml) or LPS (100 ng/ml) stimulated WT or TLR4−/− BMDCs using a specific 32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide containing the positive regulatory domains (PRDI-III) of the IFN-β gene promoter was performed. The data demonstrated that although Bryo-1 induced the binding of nuclear complexes to the IFN-β promoter DNA probe in the WT cells, Bryo-1-mediated stimulation of DNA-protein complex formation was significantly reduced and delayed in TLR4−/− BMDC (Fig. 7). These data suggested that TLR-4 was involved in the induction of IFN-β by Bryo-1, consistent with the observation that TLR4-deficient BMDC"
https://openalex.org/W1970643014,"The neural crest is a transient population of cells that emerges from the neural tube during the early stages of embryonic development. Neural crest cells are unique to vertebrates and have properties similar to stem cells, including the ability to differentiate into many cell types (i.e., multipotency) and to regenerate. Neural crest cells migrate extensively throughout the embryo and then differentiate to give rise to most of the cells in the peripheral nervous system and the facial skeleton. Because of their multipotency and regenerative ability, neural crest cells recently have garnered great attention for their potential use in stem cell-based therapies. In this SnapShot, we describe key regulatory events involved in neural crest formation, differentiation, and migration during early stages of vertebrate development."
https://openalex.org/W2099494269,"To prevent photo-oxidative damage to the photosynthetic membrane in strong light, plants dissipate excess absorbed light energy as heat in a mechanism known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). NPQ is triggered by the trans-membrane proton gradient (ΔpH), which causes the protonation of the photosystem II light-harvesting antenna (LHCII) and the PsbS protein, as well as the de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll violaxanthin to zeaxanthin. The combination of these factors brings about formation of dissipative pigment interactions that quench the excess energy. The formation of NPQ is associated with certain absorption changes that have been suggested to reflect a conformational change in LHCII brought about by its protonation. The light-minus-dark recovery absorption difference spectrum is characterized by a series of positive and negative bands, the best known of which is ΔA535. Light-minus-dark recovery resonance Raman difference spectra performed at the wavelength of the absorption change of interest allows identification of the pigment responsible from its unique vibrational signature. Using this technique, the origin of ΔA535 was previously shown to be a subpopulation of red-shifted zeaxanthin molecules. In the absence of zeaxanthin (and antheraxanthin), a proportion of NPQ remains, and the ΔA535 change is blue-shifted to 525 nm (ΔA525). Using resonance Raman spectroscopy, it is shown that the ΔA525 absorption change in Arabidopsis leaves lacking zeaxanthin belongs to a red-shifted subpopulation of violaxanthin molecules formed during NPQ. The presence of the same ΔA535 and ΔA525 Raman signatures in vitro in aggregated LHCII, containing zeaxanthin and violaxanthin, respectively, leads to a new proposal for the origin of the xanthophyll red shifts associated with NPQ.

Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). However, under certain environmental conditions, the amount of light absorbed by the LHCs is in excess of that which can be used in photochemistry. Left unchecked, the excess absorbed light energy can lead to the formation of Chl triplet states in the PSII reaction center that sensitize the production of singlet oxygen (2Ledford H.K. Niyogi K.K. Plant Cell Environ. 2005; 28: 1037-1045Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Müller P. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1558-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar, 4Horton P.

Singlet oxygen damages the PSII reaction center and other components of the photosynthetic membrane, leading to a sustained decrease in photosynthetic efficiency that is known as photoinhibition (2Ledford H.K. Niyogi K.K. Plant Cell Environ. 2005; 28: 1037-1045Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To mitigate this, plants have evolved a photoprotective mechanism, known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), whereby the excess excitation energy is safely dissipated as heat (4Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 5Holt N.E. Fleming G.R. Niyogi K.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8281-8289Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The major component of NPQ is controlled by the level of the trans-membrane proton gradient (ΔpH) formed as a result of photosynthetic electron transport and is known as qE (6Briantais J.M. Vernotte C. Picaud M. Krause G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 548: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). ΔpH formation triggers the protonation of LHCII (7Walters R.G. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and of the PsbS protein (8Li X.P. Gilmore A.M. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Golan T. Kramer D. Niyogi K.K. J. Biol.

The interaction of these three factors brings about formation of dissipative pigment interactions within the PSII antenna, thus shortening the Chl excited-state lifetime (10Gilmore A.M. Hazlett T.L.

It has been shown that qE is associated with a series of absorption changes in both the Soret and the Qy regions (18Bilger W. Bjorkman O. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 19Krause G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Bilger W. Björkman O.

These absorption changes have been suggested to reflect an altered environment of bound Chl and xanthophyll molecules, brought about by a protein conformational change within LHCII as a result of ΔpH formation (22Horton P. Ruban A.V. Rees D. Pascal A.A. Noctor G. Young A.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The light-minus-dark recovery absorption difference spectrum in the Soret region contains a series of three negative bands below 500 nm and a positive band at 535 nm (25Johnson M.P. Pérez-Bueno M.L. Zia A. Horton P. Ruban A.V. Plant Physiol. 2009; 149: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The formation and relaxation kinetics of the latter change known as ΔA535 are often monitored as a collective measure of these conformational changes. ΔA535 was originally believed to arise from selective light scattering brought about by a change in the membrane thickness linked to ΔpH formation (26Heber U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 180: 302-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 27Murakami S. Packer L. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 47: 332-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Later ΔA535 was shown to depend upon the presence of zeaxanthin and was closely correlated with the formation and relaxation of qE (18Bilger W. Bjorkman O. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 19Krause G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Bilger W. Björkman O.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In the absence of zeaxanthin, qE is greatly reduced and the ΔA535 change has a much smaller amplitude and is blue-shifted to 525 nm (ΔA525) (28Noctor G. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 339-344Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The npq4 mutant of Arabidopsis that lacks the PsbS protein was found to lack rapidly reversible qE and also lacked any ΔA535 providing a further link between these two phenomena (29Li X.P. Björkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman spectroscopy has proved of use in identifying the origin of absorption bands both in isolated light-harvesting complexes and in intact chloroplasts and even leaves (30Robert B. Horton P. Pascal A.A. Ruban A.V. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 385-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman spectroscopy confirmed that ΔA535 belonged to the 0-0 component of the S2 electronic transition of zeaxanthin (31Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7785-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The size of the zeaxanthin resonance enhancement in the Raman quenched-minus-unquenched difference spectrum at 528 nm excitation was also found to depend upon PsbS (31Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7785-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, the negative absorption changes in the qE difference spectrum below 500 nm were associated with a loss of xanthophyll resonance confirming that they also arise from true electronic transitions rather than light scattering (31Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7785-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Native isolated PsbS was found able to bind zeaxanthin, producing a red shift in its absorption spectrum mimicking ΔA535 (32Aspinall-O'Dea M. Wentworth M. Pascal A. Robert B. Ruban A. Horton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16331-16335Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The putative binding simultaneously affected protein phenylalanine absorption and circular dichroism (CD), leading to the suggestion that ΔA535 may arise from zeaxanthin binding to this hydrophobic protein (32Aspinall-O'Dea M. Wentworth M. Pascal A. Robert B. Ruban A. Horton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16331-16335Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was suggested that ΔA535 may represent the formation of a zeaxanthin-PsbS quenching complex responsible for qE (8Li X.P. Gilmore A.M. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Golan T. Kramer D. Niyogi K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22866-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, several observations have brought this proposal into question. Firstly, reconstituted PsbS was consistently found unable to bind any xanthophylls (33Dominici P. Caffarri S. Armenante F. Ceoldo S. Crimi M. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22750-22758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 34Bonente G. Caffarri S. Finazzi G. Niyogi K. Bassi R. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 91: 292Google Scholar). Secondly, PsbS was still found to perform its function in the absence of zeaxanthin (35Crouchman S. Ruban A. Horton P. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and thirdly, the npq4 mutant lacking PsbS was found to possess ΔA535 and wild-type levels of NPQ, albeit both forming on a much longer timescale than the wild-type (36Johnson M.P. Ruban A.V. Plant J. 2010; 61: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, the origin of one of the main negative bands in the qE difference spectrum peaking at 495 nm (ΔA495) was shown to depend upon the presence of lutein (25Johnson M.P. Pérez-Bueno M.L. Zia A. Horton P. Ruban A.V. Plant Physiol. 2009; 149: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis leaves lacking lutein, the band was shifted to 497 nm (in lut2−, lutein replaced by violaxanthin) and 501 nm (lut2npq2−, lutein replaced by zeaxanthin) (25Johnson M.P. Pérez-Bueno M.L. Zia A. Horton P. Ruban A.V. Plant Physiol. 2009; 149: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Very similar negative absorption changes to those observed in leaves below 500 nm have been observed upon aggregation of isolated LHCII and also in quenched but non-aggregated LHCII, suggesting that both in vivo and in vitro types of quenching may have a common origin (37Ruban A.V. Rees D. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 39-44Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 38Ilioaia C. Johnson M.P. Horton P. Ruban A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29505-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the characteristic ΔA535 change was not observed upon LHCII aggregation, although this may be due to the absence of zeaxanthin in these samples (37Ruban A.V. Rees D. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 39-44Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, the question of the exact origin of all elements of the qE-related absorption changes remains. It is known that the energy of an electronic transition within a molecule is strongly dependent on the refractive index of the solvent environment (39Le Rosen A.L. Reid C.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1952; 20: 233-236Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Bayliss N.S. J. Chem. Phys. 1950; 18: 292-296Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, such a strong red shift as seen during the ΔA535 change would require a very dramatic change in the solvent environment, possibly due to the arrival of a static dipole or a point charge in the vicinity of the zeaxanthin (41Gottfried D.S. Steffen M.A. Boxer S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 76-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 42Reich R. Sewe K.U. Photochem. Photobiol. 1977; 26: 11-17Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alternatively, this shift in absorption may arise from excitonic interactions between pairs of zeaxanthin molecules (43Ruban A.V. Landrum J.T. Carotenoids: Physical, Chemical and Biological Functions and Properties. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2009Google Scholar). These zeaxanthin pairs would occur as a result of aggregation of LHCII trimers within the thylakoid membrane. Because zeaxanthin occupies a relatively peripheral position within the LHCII trimer (44Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar), aggregation could result in close associations between xanthophylls belonging to neighboring trimers. Indeed, it has been shown that the formation of excitonically coupled J-aggregates of zeaxanthin (co-linear or “top-to-tail” chains of molecules) in water-ethanol mixtures gives rise to a red shift in the 0-0 transition to 535 nm (34Bonente G. Caffarri S. Finazzi G. Niyogi K. Bassi R. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 91: 292Google Scholar, 45Ruban A.V. Horton P. Young A.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol.

A. 2005; 109: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas lutein, antheraxanthin, and violaxanthin J-type aggregates possess red-shifted bands between 500 and 530 nm (45Ruban A.V. Horton P. Young A.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1993; 21: 229-234Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the following study, we specifically address the origin of ΔA525. Firstly, using resonance Raman experiments on intact chloroplasts lacking zeaxanthin, we identify the xanthophyll responsible for ΔA525 as violaxanthin. In addition, we show that the same Raman signature associated with ΔA535 and ΔA525 in vivo is observed upon aggregation of LHCII binding, respectively, zeaxanthin or violaxanthin in the peripheral V1 site. Arabidopsis thaliana cv Col0 (wild-type) and two mutants derived from it, npq1 (lacking zeaxanthin) and L17 (PsbS overexpressor) (47Li X.P. Muller-Moule P. Gilmore A.M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15222-15227Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), were grown for 8–9 weeks in Sanyo plant growth rooms with an 8-h photoperiod at a light intensity of 100 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 and a day/night temperature of 22/18 °C. The composition of carotenoids was determined by HPLC for leaf disks rapidly frozen in liquid N2 as described previously (48Johnson M.P. Havaux M. Triantaphylidès C. Ksas B. Pascal A.A. Robert B.

Leaves were vacuum-infiltrated with 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) to inhibit violaxanthin de-epoxidation, whereas control leaves were vacuum-infiltrated with buffer only. Chl fluorescence kinetic analyses of whole leaves was carried out using a Dual-PAM-100 fluorometer (Walz) using varying actinic intensity together with light saturation pulses (4000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) as indicated in the figures. The maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) was defined as ((Fm − Fo)/Fm), the quantum yield of PSII (ΦPSII) as ((Fm′ − Fs)/Fm′), qP as ((Fm′ − Fs)/(Fm′ − Fo′)), and NPQ as ((Fm − Fm′)/Fm′). qE-related absorption changes were recorded on whole leaves using an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer as described previously (25Johnson M.P. Pérez-Bueno M.L. Zia A. Horton P. Ruban A.V. Plant Physiol. 2009; 149: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the “dark recovery” spectrum (5 min of preillumination at 1000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 actinic light followed by 5 min of dark relaxation) from the “light” spectrum recorded in the presence of the actinic light following 5 min of preillumination. Spinach trimeric LHCII binding either violaxanthin or zeaxanthin was isolated from n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside solubilized spinach BBY membranes using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (49Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Young A.J. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). De-epoxidation of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin was achieved by incubating the thylakoids (from which BBYs were derived) for 30 min in 0.33 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm HEPES, 20 mm MES, 40 mm ascorbate at pH 5.5 at 20 °C. LHCII was desalted to remove sucrose in a PD10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) and 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. Quenched LHCII was prepared by removal of detergent by SM-2 bioabsorbent beads (Bio-Rad) allowing for a 10× reduction in fluorescence yield as determined by a PAM-101 fluorometer (Heinz Walz). Chl concentration was determined according to the method of Porra et al. (50Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). Low temperature (77 K) resonance Raman spectra were measured on leaves immediately frozen following 5 min of preillumination at 1000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 (light) or alternatively preilluminated and then frozen following an additional period of 5 min of dark relaxation (dark recovery) and on isolated LHCII prepared in the trimeric and aggregated states as described above. Purified xanthophylls prepared as described previously (51Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol.

The well known light-minus-dark recovery absorption difference spectrum in Arabidopsis wild-type leaves is presented in Fig. 1, exhibiting the usual positive maximum at 535 nm consistent with the presence of zeaxanthin (Table 1). In the npq1 difference spectrum, the positions of the negative bands below 500 nm are virtually identical, whereas the 535 nm maximum is blue-shifted to 525 nm, consistent with the absence of zeaxanthin (and antheraxanthin) (Fig. 1, Table 1). The amplitude of all bands in the difference spectrum is also smaller in npq1 than in the wild type, consistent with the lower NPQ in the former sample (Fig. 1). Using resonance Raman difference spectroscopy, the origin of the 525 nm band in the npq1 absorption difference spectrum was probed. Two Raman spectra were recorded using 528.7 nm excitation, one for leaves frozen under illumination (5 min of preillumination at 1000 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) and the second one frozen after a further 5 min of dark recovery. A light-minus-dark recovery Raman difference spectrum should then reveal a selective gain of resonance for the xanthophyll species responsible for the absorption difference (30Robert B. Horton P. Pascal A.A. Ruban A.V. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 385-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, although a resonance gain was detected in the npq1 leaves, the signal-to-noise ratio was such that it was impossible to identify accurately the xanthophyll species responsible (data not shown). Thus, to identify the origin of the ΔA525 band, we used the L17 mutant that overexpresses PsbS and thus has a much higher level of NPQ when compared with the wild type (47Li X.P. Muller-Moule P. Gilmore A.M. Niyogi K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 15222-15227Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that PsbS overexpression in this mutant also enhances qE in the absence of zeaxanthin (35Crouchman S. Ruban A. Horton P. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Using the same principle, leaves were vacuum-infiltrated with DTT, an inhibitor of xanthophyll cycle activity, such that no zeaxanthin (or antheraxanthin) was formed during illumination (Table 1). In these leaves, the level of ΔA525 was enhanced by around a factor of 2 when compared with npq1, reflecting the larger NPQ, although there was no difference in the de-epoxidation state between the two samples (Fig. 1). Consistent with this enhanced ΔA525, the light-minus-dark recovery resonance Raman difference spectrum for L17 leaves treated with DTT had a significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, a meaningful comparison with individual pigment spectra was possible, allowing us to attribute the band(s) (see below).TABLE 1Pigment composition of npq1 and L17 + DTT leavesPlantNeoLutVioAntZeaDEPsChl a/b%WT dark5.2 ± 0.517 ± 14.4 ± 0.20.2 ± 0.104 ± 0.93.1WT light5.1 ± 0.916 ± 12.0 ± 0.40.8 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.446 ± 1.23.1npq15.3 ± 0.919 ± 24.4 ± 0.8NDND03.1L17 + DTT dark5.2 ± 0.616 ± 14.4 ± 0.2NDND03.1L17+ DTT light5.2 ± 0.517 ± 24.6 ± 0.4NDND03.1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 presents the total light-minus-dark recovery resonance Raman difference spectrum using 528.7 nm excitation of L17 leaves treated with DTT. The four characteristic frequency regions of carotenoids have been assigned as follows: ν1, C=C stretching mode; ν2, C–C stretches coupled with C–H in-plane bending or C–CH3 stretching; ν3, CH3 in-plane rocking vibrations; ν4, C–H out-of-plane bending modes (30Robert B. Horton P. Pascal A.A. Ruban A.V. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 385-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The light-minus-dark recovery resonance Raman difference spectrum at 528.7 nm excitation of wild-type leaves containing zeaxanthin had a ν1 position at 1522 cm−1 (Fig. 2), consistent with the position of isolated zeaxanthin in pyridine as observed previously (31Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7785-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the ν1 position in spectra of L17+DTT leaves was significantly different, peaking at 1528 cm−1. Because the ν1 position is highly dependent upon the conjugation length of the C=C chain (conjugated double bonds) of a carotenoid, lutein, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin have respectively higher ν1 positions (51Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the case of neoxanthin, the presence of a 9-cis configuration results in a further up-shift in ν1 when compared with violaxanthin, despite them both possessing nine conjugated double bonds. The ν1 position is thus a unique “molecular fingerprint” of the xanthophyll species involved in a particular resonance enhancement in the Raman difference spectrum resulting from an absorption change (30Robert B. Horton P. Pascal A.A. Ruban A.V. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 385-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, the up-shifted ν1 position in L17+DTT leaves when compared with the wild-type confirms that a xanthophyll other than zeaxanthin is involved in the ΔA525 change (Fig. 2). Several features of the Raman difference spectrum using 528.7 nm excitation in L17+DTT leaves give clues as to the identity of the xanthophyll species responsible for the ΔA525 change. Firstly, the ν1 position at 1528 cm−1 is identical to that of isolated violaxanthin dissolved in pyridine (Fig. 3), whereas ν1 for isolated lutein is at 1524 cm−1 and ν1 for neoxanthin is at 1533 cm−1 (Fig. 3). Examination of the ν3 region of the spectrum provides further evidence of the involvement of violaxanthin in the ΔA525 change (Fig. 4). The ν3 peak position is at 1006 cm−1 in the L17+DTT Raman difference spectrum (Fig. 4), again consistent with the position of isolated violaxanthin (Fig. 4, trace 2), whereas for both isolated lutein and isolated zeaxanthin, ν3 is at 1003 cm−1 (Fig. 4). It should be noted, however, that the satellite of the main ν3 band in the L17+DTT difference spectrum is at ∼1022 cm−1, deviating slightly from the corresponding band for isolated violaxanthin (1030 cm−1), whereas it is still higher than that of isolated lutein at 1020 cm−1 (Fig. 4). To account for this deviation, the L17+DTT spectrum was compared with the previo"

Here, we show that following this endocytosis the D(3) dopamine receptors fail to recycle and are instead targeted for degradation through an interaction with the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-associated sorting protein-1 (GASP-1). Furthermore, we identified a specific binding motif in the C terminus common to the D(3) and D(2) that confers GASP-1 binding. shRNA knockdown of GASP-1 delayed post-endocytic degradation of both the D(2) and D(3) dopamine receptors. In addition, mutation of the D(2) and D(3) receptor C termini to resemble the D(4), which does not interact with GASP-1, not only inhibited GASP-1 binding but slowed degradation after endocytosis. Conversely, mutation of the C terminus of the D(4) to resemble that of the D(2) and D(3) facilitated GASP-1 binding and promoted post-endocytic degradation of the mutant D(4) receptor. Thus, we have identified a motif that is both necessary and sufficient to promote GASP-1 binding and receptor degradation. In addition, these data demonstrated that GASP-1 can mediate post-endocytic degradation of dopamine receptors that have been endocytosed not only as a consequence of dopamine activation but also as a consequence of activation by phorbol esters."

Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are the dominant subset of NKT cells that express an invariant TCRα chain (Vα14-Jα18). When activated, iNKT cells rapidly produce large amounts of IL-4 and IFNγ, along with a number of other cytokines and chemokines. iNKT cells also regulate other immune cells, such as NK cells and B cells, thus playing multiple roles in immune responses. iNKT cells develop from the DP (CD4+CD8+ double-positive) thymocytes and are selected by the MHC class I-like molecule CD1d expressed on DP cells (1Gapin L. Matsuda J.L. Surh C.D. Kronenberg M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). After selection, the iNKT precursors (CD44lowNK1.1−) further develop through more mature CD44hiNK1.1− iNKT to finally mature CD44hiNK1.1+ iNKT cells. A number of signaling molecules, transcription factors and cytokine receptors have been identified to be important for iNKT cell development through different stages. For example, SLAM, SLAM-associated protein (SAP), and Src-family kinase FYN and NFκB have been suggested to form a signaling pathway that controls iNKT cell development at a very early stage (2Pasquier B.

Itk-null mice have also been shown to have reduced iNKT cell number, impaired maturation and cytokine secretion, which is exaggerated in Itk/Txk DKO mice (23Au-Yeung B.B. Fowell D.J. J.

Thus, signals through Itk and Txk nodes are important for T cell development and function. Signal transduction pathways travel via nodes along the pathway. Each node has at least 2 edges, an input edge and an output edge (25Kaiser M. Hilgetag C.C. Biol. Cybern. 2004; 90: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Multi-domain signaling proteins may contain more than 1 input or output edges (26González-Díaz H. González-Díaz Y. Santana L. Ubeira F.M. Uriarte E. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 750-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Itk has at least 2 input edges, coming from upstream Src family kinases and from PI3 kinase (27Berg L.J. Finkelstein L.D. Lucas J.A. Schwartzberg P.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 549-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). At least 1 output edge has been identified for Itk, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 and subsequent calcium influx, leading to the activation of NFκB, NFAT, and Ras (27Berg L.J. Finkelstein L.D. Lucas J.A. Schwartzberg P.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 549-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Whether the Itk node has a single edge leading to PLC-γ1 activation, or whether it has multiple edges leading to other signaling pathways is not clear. There is evidence for other edges with which Itk can connect to downstream signaling pathways independent of the edge leading to PLC-γ1 phosphorylation. Itk can interact with the adaptor protein SLP-76 via its SH2 and SH3 domains (28Jordan M.S. Sadler J. Austin J.E. Finkelstein L.D. Singer A.L. Schwartzberg P.L. Koretzky G.A. J.

This interaction is not dependent on its kinase activity and could represent additional edges that emanate from the Itk signaling node. Indeed, kinase-deleted or kinase-inactive Itk have been shown to activate the transcription factor serum response factor or induce antigen-induced actin polarization in T cell lines (29Dombroski D.

These data suggest that additional edges emanate from the Itk signaling node, independent of the edge leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. However, whether such edges are important in vivo is not clear. We and others (29Dombroski D. Houghtling R.A. Labno C.M. Precht P. Takesono A. Caplen N.J. Billadeau D.D. Wange R.L. Burkhardt J.K.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2691-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have shown that the Itk node has edges that can activate specific pathways in a kinase independent manner. We have also shown that conventional T cells require the kinase domain edge of Itk for development (22Hu J. Sahu N. Walsh E. August A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We show here that a kinase domain mutant of Itk partially rescues the maturation defect observed in Itk-null iNKT cells. This rescue correlates with increased expression of CD122 and T-bet, as well as reduction in the elevated levels of eomesodermin observed in Itk-null iNKT cells. However, cytokine secretion by iNKT cells is dependent on the ability of Itk to phosphorylate downstream substrates. These data suggest that the Itk node downstream of the TcR has edges that are both kinase-dependent and kinase independent, which function in iNKT cell development. Wild-type (WT), Itk-null, Itk/Txk DKO (kind gift of Dr. Pamela Schwartzberg, NHGRI/NIH), Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk−/−, Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk/Txk DKO, and Tg(CD2-ItkK390R)/Itk−/− mice were on C57BL/6 background and kept in specific pathogen-free conditions. Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk−/− mice were generated as described (22Hu J. Sahu N. Walsh E. August A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk/Txk DKO mice were generated by crossing Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk−/− mice and Itk/Txk DKO mice. Tg(CD2-ItkK390R)/Itk−/− mice were generated by cloning a K390R mutant of Itk into the a transgenic expression cassette driven by the CD2 promoter and CD2 enhancer (35Zhumabekov T. Corbella P. Tolaini M. Kioussis D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These mice were backcrossed to the C57Bl/6 background over five generations and crossed to Itk-null mice. All the mice used were 6–8 weeks of age. Experiments were approved by the IACUC at the Pennsylvania State University. Cells were incubated with Fc block (BD Bioscience) for 10 min on ice, and then were incubated with fluorescent antibodies for 30 min on ice. PE-PBS57/CD1d tetramer and unloaded/CD1d tetramer were provided by the National Institutes of Health tetramer core facility. anti-PECy5-TCRβ, PECy5-CD44, and PECy7-CD4 were from BD Bioscience; anti-PECy7-NK1.1, biotin-CD122, PECy5-strepavidin, APC-alexa750-TCRβ, APC-alexa-CXCR3, APC-alexa647-T-bet were from eBiosciences; anti-ECD CD8 was from Caltag. Total iNKT cells (TCRβ+PBS-57/CD1d tetramer+) were sorted from the thymi of mice using a Cytopeia Influx Cell Sorter (Cytopeia, Seattle, WA) and RNA were extracted using RNase Mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated with You Prime First-Strand beads kit (GE Health) and quantitative real-time PCR was performed using primer/probe sets for T-bet, PLZF and eomesodermin, with GAPDH as a housekeeping gene (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle ΔΔCT method, normalized to the expression of GAPDH, and the values were expressed as fold increase compared with WT iNKT cells, which was set as 1. WT, Itk-null, and Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk−/− mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 μg of BrdU and placed on drinking water containing 0.8 mg/ml BrdU for the next 6 days. BrdU-containing drinking water was changed every 2 days. 6 days after injection, mice were sacrificed, and thymocytes isolated and stained with PE-PBS57/CD1d tetramer, followed by fixation and permeabilization. BrdU was detected using APC-BrdU kit from BD Biosciences. WT, Itk-null, and Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk−/− mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2 μg of α-galactosyl ceramide. After 2 h, blood was collected and serum samples were obtained. IL-4 and IFN-γ level were analyzed using Bioplex (Millipore). For in vitro analysis of cytokine secretion, 96-well plates were preincubated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 and 10 μg/ml anti-CD28 at 4 °C overnight. Sorted hepatic iNKT cells from WT, Itk-null, and Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk−/− mice were stimulated at 2 × 104/well in duplicate for 3 days, and cytokines were analyzed using Bioplex. Statistical evaluation was conducted for all repetitions of each experiment using Student's t test with a probability value, p ≤ 0.05, considered statistically significant. To determine if the kinase domain edge of Itk is required for the development of iNKT cells, we compared the iNKT population in WT, Itk−/−, Itk/Txk double knock-out (DKO) mice and mice carrying a mutant ITK lacking its kinase domain instead of WT Itk in Itk null or Itk/Txk (DKO) mice (Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk−/− and Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk/Txk DKO (22Hu J.

The expression level of the transgene in iNKT cells is similar to endogenous Itk as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). We found that the absence of Itk results in a reduction in the percent of iNKT cells in the thymus, and expression of the kinase-deleted mutant of Itk could rescue this percentage to WT levels (Fig. 1A). By contrast, while the percentage of thymic iNKT cells in Itk/Txk DKO was similar to that seen in the Itk−/− mice (i.e. reduced compared with WT mice), this percentage was not rescued by expression of the kinase-deleted mutant (Fig. 1A). The numbers of thymic iNKT cells were also significantly reduced in Itk−/− mice compared with WT mice as previously reported (Fig. 1B and Refs. 23Au-Yeung B.B. Fowell D.J. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Felices M. Berg L.J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 3007-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Expression of the kinase domain-deleted mutant in Itk−/− mice did not rescue the numbers of thymic iNKT cells as there was no significant difference between Itk−/−/ΔKin and Itk−/− mice (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the numbers of thymic iNKT cells was significantly reduced in Itk/Txk DKO mice compared with Itk−/− mice (Fig. 1B), and these numbers were not rescued by expression of the kinase domain-deleted mutant (Fig. 1, A and B). Together, these results suggest that the generation of proper numbers of iNKT cells requires the kinase activity of Itk, and the expression of Txk. Analyzing the three stages of iNKT cell maturation in the thymus, we found that the absence of Itk results in a significant accumulation of iNKT cells at stage 2 (Fig. 2A). By contrast, the percentage of thymic iNKT cells at stage 2 was reduced and the percentage at stage 3 was significantly increased in the Itk−/−/ΔKin transgenic mice compared with Itk−/− mice (Fig. 2A). This suggests that the kinase domain independent edge of Itk is sufficient to allow maturation of iNKT cells through the immature stage 2 to the more mature stage 3. However, because the percentage of thymic stage 3 iNKT cells in the Itk−/−/ΔKin mice is still lower than in the WT mice, the kinase activity of Itk is required for the full maturation of iNKT cells through to stage 2. The percentage of stage 2 iNKT cells in Itk/Txk DKO mice was similar to that seen in the absence of Itk, and expression of the kinase domain-deleted mutant did not rescue the percentage, suggesting that Txk may be involved in the non-kinase domain edge of Itk in iNKT cell maturation (Fig. 2A). There are two defined subsets of murine iNKT cells, CD4+ or CD4−CD8− (DN). Analyzing these two populations, we found that about 50% of thymic iNKT cells in WT mice were DN, which was significantly decreased to around 20% (p < 0.05) in Itk−/− mice, demonstrating that Itk is important in iNKT subset development (Fig. 2B). However, analysis of iNKT cell subsets in Itk−/−/ΔKin mice revealed that the percentage of thymic DN iNKT cells was similar to that in Itk−/− mice, indicating that the kinase activity edge of Itk is important for the generation of these two subsets of iNKT (Fig. 2B). Because the kinase domain deletion mutant partly rescues the maturation of iNKT cells, this also suggests that the effect of Itk on the distribution of iNKT cell subsets may not be due to larger numbers of immature iNKT cells in these mice. Thymic NK1.1− iNKT cells have higher proliferative rates than NK1.1+ iNKT cells. Labeling with BrdU would therefore result in higher incorporation in the former population over the same time period. Compared with WT iNKT cells, a much higher percentage of Itk−/− iNKT cells labeled with BrdU (Fig. 2C), and as expected most of the BrdU+ iNKT cells in Itk−/− mice were NK1.1−, and the percentage of BrdU+ Itk−/−/ΔKin iNKT cells was lower than those from Itk−/− mice, consistent with the higher percentage of mature NK1.1+ iNKT cells in the Itk−/−/ΔKin mice (Fig. 2C). These data add further support for a role for Itk in iNKT development and maturation that is partly independent of its kinase activity. We also examined whether expression of CD1d and the SLAM family receptors, SLAM and Ly 108, on DP thymocytes are affected by Itk. We found that these receptors were expressed at similar levels on DP thymocytes from WT, Itk−/−, and Itk−/−/ΔKin mice, indicating that differential expression of these molecules is not responsible for the reduced iNKT cell numbers in these mice (Fig. 2D). Itk is suggested to form either intramolecular folded monomers or intermolecular dimer in the cells, which may maintain Itk in the inactive state (36Qi Q. Sahu N. August A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38529-38534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Qi Q. August A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Deletion of the kinase domain may disrupt the conformation of Itk, allowing for easier interactions between Itk and other signaling proteins, and making that edge more active. To test this possibility, we generated mice carrying an Itk mutant, K390R, which is defective in kinase activity instead of the WT Itk (Tg(CD2-ItkK390R)/Itk−/−, Itk−/−/K390R for simplicity). This mutant of Itk has all domains intact, and instead carries a single point mutation in the kinase domain. We have shown that such a mutant likely folds in a similar fashion as the WT kinase (37Qi Q. August A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29882-29892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Analysis of these mice revealed that the numbers of thymic iNKT cells were similar to that found in Itk−/− and Itk−/−/ΔKin mice, and significantly lower than WT mice (Fig. 3A). More importantly, there was a significant increase in the percentage of more mature stage 3 iNKT cells in the Itk−/−/K390R mice, but no change in the altered CD4/DN ratio of iNKT in the thymus compared with Itk−/− mice (Fig. 3, B and C). These data are very similar to the data from the Itk−/−/ΔKin mice, further supporting the conclusion that maturation of iNKT cells is partly independent of Itk kinase activity edge. Examination of the maturation status of peripheral iNKT cells reveals that expression of the Itk K390R mutant (as well as the ItkΔkinase mutant, data not shown) was not able to rescue the defect in maturation or numbers of splenic iNKT cells (Fig. 4A). By contrast, liver iNKT cell maturation is not affected by the absence of Itk (2Pasquier B. Yin L. Fondanèche M.C. Relouzat F. Bloch-Queyrat C. Lambert N. Fischer A. de Saint-Basile G. Latour S. J.

Immunol. 2007; 37: 2892-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and expression of the Itk K390R mutant does not affect this process (Fig. 4B). In the absence of Itk, iNKT cells are defective in secreting IL-4 and IFN-γ in response to α-GalCer stimulation (23Au-Yeung B.B. Fowell D.J. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Felices M. Berg L.J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 3007-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine whether the kinase activity of Itk is important in iNKT cell function, WT, Itk−/− and Tg(Lck-ItkΔKin)/Itk−/− mice were injected with α-GalCer and serum samples collected 2 h after injection. Analysis of the serum revealed that Itk−/− mice secreted significantly lower amounts of IL-4 and IFN-γ than WT mice consistent with previous reports (23Au-Yeung B.B. Fowell D.J. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Felices M. Berg L.J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 3007-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Expression of kinase domain-deleted mutant in Itk-null mice did not rescue this defect in cytokine production, indicating that the kinase activity of Itk is required for the function of iNKT cells (Fig. 4C). Because Itk-null mice (and the Itk−/−/ΔKin mice) have reduced numbers of iNKT cells, we also stimulated purified hepatic iNKT cells in vitro with anti-CD3 and CD28 for 3 days to confirm the reduction in cytokine secretion. We found that Itk−/− and Itk−/−/ΔKin iNKT cells secreted comparable amounts of IL-4 and IFN-γ, which were significantly lower than that secreted by WT iNKT cells (Fig. 4D). Altogether, these data indicate that the kinase activity edge of Itk is important for IL-4 and IFN-γ production of iNKT cells. Our analysis indicates that the population of thymic CD122+ (IL-2/IL-15 receptor β chain) iNKT cells in Itk deficient was reduced compared with WT mice (Fig. 5A). By contrast, we found that this CD122+ iNKT cell population was significantly higher in the Itk−/−/ΔKin mice than in Itk−/− mice, indicating that the increased expression of CD122 may contribute to the increased maturation of iNKT cell in the mice carrying the mutant Itk. These data also suggest that Itk may regulate CD122 expression via a kinase independent edge. The transcription factor T-bet can regulate the expression of CD122, and we found that Itk−/−/ΔKin iNKT cells had significantly increased levels of T-bet mRNA and protein compared with Itk−/− iNKT cells (Fig. 5, B and C). In addition, expression levels of CXCR3, another target of T-bet (40Matsuda J.L. Zhang Q. Ndonye R. Richardson S.K. Howell A.R. Gapin L. Blood. 2006; 107: 2797-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), was also rescued by the expression the equivalent K390R Itk mutant (Fig. 5D). More dramatically, the expression level of eomesodermin, another transcription factor of T-box family that also regulates CD122, was not detected in WT iNKT cells, but was highly expressed in the Itk−/− iNKT cells (Fig. 5B). Pointedly, the expression of the Itk kinase-deleted mutant significantly reduced eomesodermin expression in Itk−/− iNKT cells (i.e. iNKT cells that develop in the Itk−/−/ΔKin mice), suggesting that kinase domain independent edge signals may affect signaling pathways leading to T-bet and eomesodermin expression in iNKT cells. Two recent studies have shown that that the transcription factor PLZF is important for iNKT cell development at early stage (10Savage A.K. Constantinides M.G. Han J. Picard D. Martin E. Li B.

Kim H.J. Im J.S. Pandolfi P.P. Sant'Angelo D.B. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and we found that PLZF mRNA levels were significantly elevated in Itk-null iNKT cells, and this was not normalized by expression of the Itk mutant (Fig. 5B). We show here that the Itk node in T cell receptor signaling regulates the maturation of iNKT cells in part via an edge that is kinase-independent. The partial rescue of iNKT cell maturation depends on the continued expression of the related kinase node Txk, and occurs primarily by signaling the maturation of these cells through the immature stage 2 to the more mature stage 3. This correlates with increased expression of T-bet and CD122, and decreased expression of eomesodermin. Our data suggest that signals emanating from the non-catalytic domains of Itk can act as an edge in the signaling pathway that regulates the expression of these factors, thus modulating iNKT cell development. Our analysis revealed that the number of thymic iNKT cells cannot be rescued by the expression of the kinase domain mutants of Itk, indicating that the kinase activity edge is critical for transducing signals that lead to WT numbers of these cells. This could be intrinsic, or could be related to the reduced numbers of total thymocytes observed in the Itk−/− and Itk−/−/ΔKin mice, because the overall numbers of thymocytes, and in particular DP thymocytes, play critical roles in iNKT cell development and numbers (1Gapin L. Matsuda J.L. Surh C.D. Kronenberg M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Indeed, while there is a slight increase in the percentage of iNKT cells in the thymus of Itk−/−/ΔKin mice, the total number of thymocytes is not rescued in these mice, and this translates into reduced numbers (although slightly higher) of iNKT cells in these mice. We also tested whether the kinase-deleted mutant would behave differently from a full-length kinase that has little to no kinase activity. We compared these two mutants as it is possible that the folding of the kinase-deleted mutant may be different from the WT"

To gain a deeper understanding of the BAK regulation, we developed a mini-system consisting of BAK, MCL-1, and BID-BH3 peptides with detergents to mimic the membrane environment of the cell. We used NMR spectroscopy, pulldown assays, and size exclusion chromatography to assess protein-protein binding and structural transitions. We find that detergent is required for the direct interaction between BAK and MCL-1 in vitro and that heterodimerization occurs through binding of the BH3 region of BAK to the BH3-binding site of MCL-1. The protein fragments used are summarized in Fig. 2. FLAG-BAK-HMK-ΔTM-His6 (residues 2–186 from NCBI: AAA74466), calpain-proteolysed BAK (cBAK, residues 16–186 from NCBI: AAA74466), cBAK-L78A, core domain of MCL-1 (also calpain-proteolysed MCL-1, cMCL-1, residues 163–326 from NCBI: AAF64255) and BID-BH3 peptide (residues 76–106 from NCBI: NP_001187 with an N-terminal extension of GPLG) were purified as described previously (6Moldoveanu T.

Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) containing the corresponding plasmid was grown in LB media at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm and then induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at 30 °C for 4 h. For NMR samples, cells were grown in M9 media supplemented with 15N ammonium chloride. The soluble proteins were purified by batch Ni2+-NTA or glutathione S-transferase affinity chromatography (Qiagen), followed by Sephadex G-75 size exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare) and Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare). A calpain digestion step was further applied to produce cBAK, cBAK-L78A, and cMCL-1, and calpain was removed by Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography. BAK-BH3 (TMGQVGRQLAIIGDDINRRY) and BAK-BH3-L78A (TMGQVGRQAAIIGDDINRRY) peptides were synthesized chemically (Sheldon Biotechnology Centre, McGill University) and purified on a C18 reverse-phase column. All proteins and peptides were stored in 20 mm HEPES (pH 6.5) and 1 mm DTT buffer by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The mutation L78A in the BH3 region of BAK was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenesis was carried out by using FLAG-BAK-HMK-ΔTM-His6 in pET29b(+) plasmid as a template and using oligonucleotides (CAGGTGGGACGGCAGGCCGCCATCATCGGGGAC) and (GTCCCCGATGATGGCGGCCTGCCGTCCCACCTG) as PCR primers. The construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. MCL-1 ΔN151-ΔC7, cBAK, and their mixture were prepared at 2 mg/ml (for the mixture, the concentration for each protein is 2 mg/ml) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), 1 mm DTT and with or without 0.1% IGEPAL (tert-octylphenoxy poly(oxyethylene)ethanol, average molecular weight 603; Sigma-Aldrich). The size exclusion running buffer contained 25 mm HEPES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and with or without 0.1% IGEPAL. A 30-μl sample was injected for Superdex 200 PC (3.2/30) analytical runs. The chromatographs were recorded and analyzed on Waters Millenium HPLC software. The identities of the proteins in the peak fractions were confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Three buffers: buffer N, buffer W and buffer E, each containing 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 500 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mm NaN3, with the addition 10 mm or 30 mm or 250 mm imidazole, respectively, were used in pulldown assays. Detergents were added as indicated. The Ni2+-NTA resin was first equilibrated with buffer N and excess buffer removed to obtain a 50:50 (resin:buffer) slurry. To 50 μl of this slurry, 50 μl of 1 mg/ml FLAG-BAK-HMK-ΔTM-His6, cMCL-1, or a 1:1 mixture of FLAG-BAK-HMK-ΔTM-His6:cMCL-1 were applied in the presence of different concentrations of IGEPAL or CHAPS as indicated. After an incubation time of 30 min at room temperature, the slurry was spin down at 7,000 rpm for 30 s, and the supernatant was removed. The resin in the pellet was washed three times with 500 μl of buffer W and eluted with 45 μl of buffer E. The elution was then mixed with 15 μl of 4× SDS buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. For BID-BH3 peptide competition assays, all the buffers contained 0.1% IGEPAL. The FLAG-BAK-HMK-ΔTM-His6·cMCL-1 complex was first immobilized on Ni2+-NTA resin, and then the resin slurry was prepared similarly. A range of BID-BH3 peptide concentrations were applied to the resin slurry followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature, centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 30 s, and removal of the supernatant. The resin was washed three times with buffer W and eluted with buffer E. The elution and supernatant were then mixed with 4× SDS buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. ITC was carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC titration calorimeter controlled by the VPViewer software (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA). Experiments were performed in 50 mm Na·HEPES (pH 7.0) at 23 °C and consisted of 37 injections of 8 μl of 0.1 mm BAK-BH3 or BAK-BH3-L78A peptide into 1.45 ml of 0.01 mm human MCL-1 (four different constructs) to obtain a final peptide/protein ratio of 2:1. The calorimetric data were analyzed by ORIGIN software to determine thermodynamic binding constants. NMR titrations were carried on 0.1 mm 15N-labeled cMCL-1 or 15N-labeled cBAK. Aliquots of unlabeled binding partners such as cMCL-1, cBAK, cBAK-L78A, BID-BH3, BAK-BH3-L78A, IGEPAL, and CHAPS stock solutions were titrated in until the saturation was achieved. The 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX600 MHz spectrometer at 30 °C, processed by NMRPipe (35Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). The backbone assignments of cMCL-1 and BAK in free form were determined previously (6Moldoveanu T. Liu Q. Tocilj A. Watson M.

The changes were calculated as ((Δ1H ppm)2 + (0.2 × Δ15N ppm)2)0.5) as a function of the residue number, and mapped onto the three-dimensional structures. The model of unliganded human cMCL-1 was calculated by Modeler 9 (version 2) (37Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar) based on the structure of the Mus musculus MCL-1 protein 1WSX (38Day C.L. Chen L. Richardson S.J. Harrison P.J. Huang D.C.

Tocilj A. Watson M. Shore G. Gehring K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Regulation of BAK by MCL-1 and BCL-XL has been proposed to occur through the engagement of its BH3 region into the hydrophobic groove of antiapoptotic proteins (18Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 19Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). However, in the crystal structure of BAK (6Moldoveanu T. Liu Q. Tocilj A. Watson M. Shore G. Gehring K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the BH3 region is partially buried in the protein interior and unavailable for binding without a major conformational change. To investigate the interaction of BAK with the inhibitor MCL-1, purified components were mixed in aqueous solution for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Neither condition resulted in the formation of a MCL-1·BAK complex, as indicated by the failure of cMCL-1 to be retained on Ni2+-NTA resin by FLAG-BAK-HMK-ΔTM-His6 in a pulldown experiment, the absence of elution shifts in analytical size exclusion chromatography, and the absence of chemical shift changes in the NMR spectra of 15N-labeled cMCL-1 or 15N-labeled cBAK upon the addition of unlabeled partner (data not shown). Therefore, under these conditions, we conclude that MCL-1 and BAK do not interact with each other. Pioneering studies on BCL-2 proteins revealed that specific detergents can induce conformational changes and/or their oligomerization (24Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11024-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Detergents can also induce BAK-mediated apoptosis (9Sawai H. Domae N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These led us to test the behavior of BAK and MCL-1 in the presence of detergents. We used both IGEPAL (a nonionic detergent) and CHAPS (a zwitterionic detergent) in our tests. Nonionic detergents have been reported to artificially promote the interactions between BCL-2 family of proteins (41Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), whereas CHAPS has been reported to reduce the dimerization between BAX and tBID (42Lovell J.F. Billen L.P. Bindner S. Shamas-Din A. Fradin C. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Cell. 2008; 135: 1074-1084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of a range of IGEPAL concentrations from four times below its critical micelle concentration (∼0.02% v/v) to 20 times above, only slight chemical shift changes were observed in 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled cMCL-1 (Fig. 3A and data not shown). The well dispersed pattern of peaks indicates that MCL-1 maintained its three-dimensional α-helical conformation. Analysis of the titration at 0.1% IGEPAL (Fig. 3, B and C) showed that the largest shifts, in the range of 0.1 to 0.16 ppm, came from the residues located in helix α2, α4, α5, and the end of α6, which comprise the hydrophobic groove for BH3 peptide binding. The cMCL-1 detergent interaction was transient and did not involve the formation of a protein·micelle complex or the oligomerization of cMCL-1, as shown by the absence of changes in the analytical size exclusion chromatography profile (Fig. 3D, blue trace, 17.2 min). Similar titrations with cBAK resulted in a very different behavior. At low IGEPAL concentrations, there was a gradual disappearance of peaks in the spectrum of 15N-labeled cBAK, and at 0.05% IGEPAL, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum started to display a pattern typical of unfolded proteins (Fig. 3E, red, recorded in 0.1% IGEPAL). This suggests IGEPAL unfolds cBAK and the small number of signals observed (Fig. 3E, red) indicates that the majority of BAK inserts into the large detergent micelles. Additionally, the elution time of cBAK on analytical size exclusion chromatography shifts from 17.8 min (Fig. 3D, red trace) to 13.5 min (green trace). This high molecular weight peak could be either oligomers of cBAK or cBAK associated with IGEPAL micelles. Thus, we observed a strongly altered conformation of BAK in the presence of IGEPAL. In comparison, the application of 2% (w/v) CHAPS generated little effects on both cMCL-1 and cBAK. Titrations with CHAPS induced only very minor chemical shift changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of both proteins (Fig. 4, A and D). Even after overnight incubation (supplemental Fig. S1), the shifts were under 0.19 ppm for cMCL-1 (Fig. 4B) and 0.16 ppm for cBAK (Fig. 4E), which suggests that only minor conformational changes occurred. Perturbations of chemical shifts above 0.10 ppm occurred in the residues located in helices α2 to α5 and the end of α6 in cMCL-1 (Fig. 4C) and helices α3 to α5 in cBAK (Fig. 4F), indicating that the CHAPS interacts weakly with both proteins in their putative BH3-binding hydrophobic grooves. In light of the IGEPAL-mediated conformational changes in BAK, we tested whether either detergent allows the association of BAK with MCL-1. On analytical size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3D), addition of MCL-1 ΔN151-ΔC7 to cBAK in 0.1% IGEPAL gave rise to a peak that eluted at 13.2 min (black trace), which suggests the formation of a MCL-1·BAK·micelle complex larger than either cBAK or MCL-1 ΔN151-ΔC7 alone in IGEPAL. Ni2+-NTA resin pulldown experiments showed that 0.1% IGEPAL was sufficient for FLAG-BAK-HMK-ΔTM-His6 to retain cMCL-1 on the Ni2+-NTA resin at an ∼1:1 ratio (Fig. 5A). In NMR titrations, the HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled cMCL-1 were strongly disturbed in the presence of both cBAK and IGEPAL (Fig. 5B). These results confirm a direct interaction between cBAK and cMCL-1. To our surprise, 2% CHAPS also sufficed to promote the association between MCL-1 and BAK. Fig. 6A shows that a concentration of CHAPS at 2% (above its critical micelle concentration of 0.5%) was sufficient for retention of cMCL-1 by FLAG-BAK-HMK-ΔTM-His6 on the Ni2+-NTA resin. The well dispersed 1H-15N HSQC spectra of both proteins in 2% CHAPS allowed us to detect the interaction using either 15N-labeled cBAK or cMCL-1 (Fig. 6, B and C). In both cases, the formation of a large high molecular weight complex of cBAK and cMCL-1 led to a loss of the majority of signals in the spectrum. The observation of the MCL-1·BAK complex encouraged us to ask how BAK interacts with MCL-1. From experiments using cell lysates (18Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 19Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), it was proposed that BAK associates with MCL-1 through its BH3 region. To verify this, we involved a peptide derived from the BH3 region of BAK, BAK-BH3, in our test. Titration of unlabeled BAK-BH3 into 15N-labeled cMCL-1 generated many chemical shift changes in the slow exchange regime, which is indicative of tight binding (Fig. 7A). In agreement with work from Hinds and co-workers (17Day C.L. Smits C. Fan F.C. Lee E.F. Fairlie W.D. Hinds M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 958-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the BAK-BH3 peptide engages the hydrophobic groove of MCL-1 (Fig. 7, B and C). The dissociation constants for MCL-1 constructs with different N-terminal deletions (15Liu Q. Moldoveanu T. Sprules T. Matta-Camacho E. Mansur-Azzam N. Gehring K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19615-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and BAK-BH3 peptides (wild-type and L78A mutant) were further tested by ITC in the absence of detergents (supplemental Fig. S2). As observed previously, removal of the N- and C-terminal extensions increased the affinity of MCL-1 for the BH3 peptides (15Liu Q. Moldoveanu T. Sprules T. Matta-Camacho E. Mansur-Azzam N. Gehring K. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19615-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The wild-type BAK-BH3 bound MCL-1 tightly with affinities ranging from 0.11 to 0.021 μm. In contrast, the mutation of L78A in BAK-BH3 decreased the affinity 160-fold (Table 1).TABLE 1Dissociation constants tested by ITC at 23 °CPeptidesMCL-1 ConstructsMCL-1ΔC23MCL-1ΔN119-C23MCL-1ΔN151-C7cMCL-1ΔN153-C24μmμmμmμmBAK-BH30.110.0480.0230.021BAK-BH3-L78A198.03.33.3 Open table in a new tab The binding of BAK-BH3 to MCL-1 directed us to test whether the BAK interacted in a similar manner to the BH3 peptide.

We have identified key regulatory elements in the promoter region that are involved in human NT/N (hNT/N) gene expression in the novel human endocrine cell line, BON, which resembles intestinal N cells in several important aspects including NT/N precursor protein processing, ratios of different NT/N mRNA isoforms, and high levels of constitutive expression of the NT/N gene. In this study, we demonstrated multiple cis-regulatory elements including a proximal region containing a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)/AP-1-like element that binds both the AP-1 and CRE-binding protein (CREB)/ATF proteins (c-Jun, ATF-1, ATF-2, JunD, and CREB). Similar to the rat NT/N gene, this region is critical for constitutive hNT/N gene expression. Moreover, we identified a novel region that binds the orphan hormone receptor, NR2F2. We have demonstrated that the C terminus of NR2F2 strongly represses hNT/N transcription, whereas an N-terminal domain antagonizes this repressive effect. Regulation of NT/N expression by NR2F2 may have important consequences for lipid metabolism. We speculate that a complex interplay between the proximal CRE/AP-1-like motif and NR2F2 binding region exists to regulate hNT/N expression, which is critical for the high level of constitutive expression of NT/N in enteroendocrine cells. Finally, the BON cell line provides a unique model to characterize the factors regulating expression of the hNT/N gene and to better understand the mechanisms responsible for terminal differentiation of the N cell lineage in the gut."
