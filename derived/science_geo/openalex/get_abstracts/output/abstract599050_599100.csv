https://openalex.org/W2767416953,"Cancer is considered one of the primary diseases that cause morbidity and mortality in millions of people worldwide and due to its prevalence, there is undoubtedly an unmet need to discover novel anticancer drugs. However, the traditional process of drug discovery and development is lengthy and expensive, so the application of in silico techniques and optimization algorithms in drug discovery projects can provide a solution, saving time and costs. A set of 617 approved anticancer drugs, constituting the active domain, and a set of 2,892 natural products, constituting the inactive domain, were employed to build predictive models and to index natural products for their anticancer bioactivity. Using the iterative stochastic elimination optimization technique, we obtained a highly discriminative and robust model, with an area under the curve of 0.95. Twelve natural products that scored highly as potential anticancer drug candidates are disclosed. Searching the scientific literature revealed that few of those molecules (Neoechinulin, Colchicine, and Piperolactam) have already been experimentally screened for their anticancer activity and found active. The other phytochemicals await evaluation for their anticancerous activity in wet lab."
https://openalex.org/W2767353530,"Objectives Dutch health economic guidelines include a costing manual, which describes preferred research methodology for costing studies and reference prices to ensure high quality studies and comparability between study outcomes. This paper describes the most important revisions of the costing manual compared to the previous version. Methods An online survey was sent out to potential users of the costing manual to identify topics for improvement. The costing manual was aligned with contemporary health economic guidelines. All methodology sections and parameter values needed for costing studies, particularly reference prices, were updated. An expert panel of health economists was consulted several times during the review process. The revised manual was reviewed by two members of the expert panel and by reviewers of the Dutch Health Care Institute. Results The majority of survey respondents was satisfied with content and usability of the existing costing manual. Respondents recommended updating reference prices and adding some particular commonly needed reference prices. Costs categories were adjusted to the international standard: 1) costs within the health care sector; 2) patient and family costs; and 3) costs in other sectors. Reference prices were updated to reflect 2014 values. The methodology chapter was rewritten to match the requirements of the costing manual and preferences of the users. Reference prices for nursing days of specific wards, for diagnostic procedures and nurse practitioners were added. Conclusions The usability of the costing manual was increased and parameter values were updated. The costing manual became integrated in the new health economic guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2767527018,"Background So far, it has not yet been studied whether socioeconomic status is associated with distinct frailty components and for which frailty component this association is the strongest. We aimed to examine the association between socioeconomic status and frailty and frailty components. In addition we assessed the mediating effect of the number of morbidities on the association between socioeconomic status and other frailty components. Methods This is a cross-sectional study of pooled data of The Older Persons and Informal Caregivers Survey Minimum DataSet in the Netherlands among community-dwelling persons aged 55 years and older (n = 26,014). Frailty was measured with a validated Frailty Index that consisted of 45 items. The Frailty Index contained six components: morbidities, limitations in activities of daily living (ADL), limitations in instrumental ADL (IADL), health-related quality of life, psychosocial health and self-rated health. Socioeconomic indicators used were education level and neighbourhood socioeconomic status. Results Persons with primary or secondary education had higher overall frailty and frailty component scores compared to persons with tertiary education (P < .001). Lower education levels were most consistently associated with higher overall frailty, more morbidities and worse self-rated health (P < .05 in all age groups). The strongest association was found between primary education and low psychosocial health for persons aged 55–69 years and more IADL limitations for persons aged 80+ years. Associations between neighborhood socioeconomic status and frailty (components) also showed inequalities, although less strong. The number of morbidities moderately to strongly mediated the association between socioeconomic indicators and other frailty components. Conclusion There are socioeconomic inequalities in frailty and frailty components. Inequalities in frailty, number of morbidities and self-rated health are most consistent across age groups. The number of morbidities a person has play an important role in explaining socioeconomic inequalities in frailty and should be taken into account in the management of frailty."

We assessed imaging biomarkers and performed gene expression profiling in a single-arm open-label clinical trial of tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib in patients with SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).MethodsPrimary objectives were safety and pharmacokinetics. Secondary outcomes included clinical assessments, quantitative high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, serum biomarker assays and skin biopsy-based gene expression subset assignments. Clinical response was defined as decrease of g5 or g20% from baseline in the modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS). Pulmonary function was assessed at baseline and day 169.ResultsDasatinib was well-tolerated in 31 patients receiving drug for a median of nine months. No significant changes in clinical assessments or serum biomarkers were seen at six months. By quantitative HRCT, 65% of patients showed no progression of lung fibrosis, and 39% showed no progression of total ILD. Among 12 subjects with available baseline and post-treatment skin biopsies, three were improvers and nine were non-improvers. Improvers mapped to the fibroproliferative or normal-like subsets, while seven out of nine non-improvers were in the inflammatory subset (p = 0.0455). Improvers showed stability in forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), while both measures showed a decline in non-improvers (p = 0.1289 and p = 0.0195, respectively). Inflammatory gene expression subset was associated with higher baseline HRCT score (p = 0.0556). Non-improvers showed significant increase in lung fibrosis (p = 0.0313).ConclusionsIn patients with SSc-ILD dasatinib treatment was associated with acceptable safety profile but no significant clinical efficacy. Patients in the inflammatory gene expression subset showed increase in skin fibrosis, decreasing pulmonary function and worsening lung fibrosis during the study. These findings suggest that target tissue-specific gene expression analyses can help match patients and therapeutic interventions in heterogeneous diseases such as SSc, and quantitative HRCT is useful for assessing clinical outcomes.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov NCT00764309."
https://openalex.org/W2767868604,"Vitamin D has immunomodulatory properties giving it the potential to affect microbial colonization of the intestinal tract. We investigated whether maternal vitamin D supplemention, maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, or direct supplementation of the infant influences key bacterial taxa within microbiota of one month old infants. Infant and maternal vitamin D supplement use was ascertained via questionnaires. Maternal plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D was determined at approximately the 36th week of pregnancy. In 913 one month old infants in the prospective KOALA Birth Cohort Study, fecal Bifidobacterium spp., Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis group, Lactobacillus spp. and total bacteria were quantified with real-time polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 16S rRNA gene sequences. The association between vitamin D exposure and prevalence or abundance of a specific bacterial group or species was analyzed using logistic or linear regression, respectively. There was a statistically significant negative linear trend between counts of Bifidobacterium spp. and levels of maternal vitamin D supplementation and maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D quintiles, respectively. In addition, a positive linear trend between quintile groups and B. fragilis group counts was observed. Lower counts of C. difficile were associated with vitamin D supplementation of breast fed infants whose mothers were more likely to adhere to an alternative lifestyle in terms of, e.g., dietary habits. These data suggest that vitamin D influences the abundance of several key bacterial taxa within the infant microbiota. Given that intestinal microbiotic homeostasis may be an important factor in the prevention of immune mediated diseases and that vitamin D status is a modifiable factor, further investigation of the impact of postnatal vitamin D supplementation should be conducted in older infants."
https://openalex.org/W2767225464,"SOX9 has been previously shown to be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other types of cancer. However, prognostic studies so far involved rather small cohorts or lack external validation and experimental data. In this study, we firstly determined the histological expression pattern of SOX9 in human HCC by immunohistochemistry (n = 84) and evaluated its prognostic value. External cohorts of publicly available datasets were used to validate its prognostic relevance in HCC (n = 359) and other types of cancer including breast (n = 3951), ovarian (n = 1306), lung (n = 1926) and gastric cancer (n = 876). Functional SOX9 knock-down studies using siRNA and cancer stem cell models were generated in a panel of liver and breast cancer cell lines. High level of SOX9 was associated with poor survival even after adjustment for other prognostic factors in multivariate analysis (HR = 2.103, 95%CI = 1.064 to 4.156, p = 0.021). SOX9 prevailed a poor prognostic factor in all cancer validation cohorts (p<0.05). Reduced SOX9 expression by siRNA decreased the growth of liver cancer cells (p<0.05). SOX9 expression was associated with stem cell features in all tested cell lines (p<0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrated in a large number of patients from multiple cohorts that high levels of SOX9 are a consistent negative prognostic factor."
https://openalex.org/W2767451971,"Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a key purinergic signal that mediates cell-to-cell communication both within and between organ systems. We address the need for a robust and minimally invasive approach to measuring extracellular ATP by re-engineering the ATeam ATP sensor to be expressed on the cell surface. Using this approach, we image real-time changes in extracellular ATP levels with a sensor that is fully genetically-encoded and does not require an exogenous substrate. In addition, the sensor is ratiometric to allow for reliable quantitation of extracellular ATP fluxes. Using live-cell microscopy, we characterize sensor performance when expressed on cultured Neuro2A cells, and we measure both stimulated release of ATP and its clearance by ectonucleotidases. Thus, this proof-of-principle demonstrates a first-generation sensor to report extracellular ATP dynamics that may be useful for studying purinergic signaling in living specimens."
https://openalex.org/W2767343810,"Steatosis has a low tolerance against ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). To prevent IRI in the steatotic liver, we attempted to elucidate the protective effect of astaxanthin (ASTX) in the steatotic liver model by giving mice a methionine and choline-deficient high fat (MCDHF) diet. Levels of lipid peroxidation and apoptosis, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and heme oxygenase (HO)-1, in the liver were assessed. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis-related proteins and members of the signaling pathway were also examined in isolated Kupffer cells and/or hepatocytes from the steatotic liver. ASTX decreased serum ALT and AST levels, the amount of TUNEL, F4/80, or 4HNE-positive cells and the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines in MCDHF mice by IRI. Moreover, HO-1 and HIF-1α, phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR expressions were increased by ASTX. The inflammatory cytokines produced by Kupffer, which were subjected to hypoxia and reoxygenation (HR), were inhibited by ASTX. Expressions of Bcl-2, HO-1 and Nrf2 in hepatocytes by HR were increased, whereas Caspases activation, Bax and phosphorylation of ERK, MAPK, and JNK were suppressed by ASTX. Pretreatment with ASTX has a protective effect and is a safe therapeutic treatment for IRI, including for liver transplantation of the steatotic liver."
https://openalex.org/W2767672289,"Excess circulating insulin is associated with obesity in humans and in animal models. However, the physiologic causality of hyperinsulinemia in adult obesity has rightfully been questioned because of the absence of clear evidence that weight loss can be induced by acutely reversing diet-induced hyperinsulinemia. Herein, we describe the consequences of inducible, partial insulin gene deletion in a mouse model in which animals have already been made obese by consuming a high-fat diet. A modest reduction in insulin production/secretion was sufficient to cause significant weight loss within 5 wk, with a specific effect on visceral adipose tissue. This result was associated with a reduction in the protein abundance of the lipodystrophy gene polymerase I and transcript release factor (Ptrf; Cavin) in gonadal adipose tissue. RNAseq analysis showed that reduced insulin and weight loss also associated with a signature of reduced innate immunity. This study demonstrates that changes in circulating insulin that are too fine to adversely affect glucose homeostasis nonetheless exert control over adiposity.—Page, M.

https://openalex.org/W2767954825,"Objectives Despite improved glycemic control, the rate of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants remains high in pregnancies complicated by diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM). Poor glycemic control, obesity, and excessive gestational weight gain are the main risk factors. The aim of this study was to determine the relative contribution of these risk factors for LGA in women with T1DM and T2DM, after controlling for important confounders such as age, smoking, and parity. Methods In this retrospective chart review study, we analyzed the medical files of pregnant women with T1DM and T2DM who attended the antenatal care program at Skåne University Hospital during the years 2006 to 2016. HbA1c was used as a measure of glycemic control. Maternal weight in early pregnancy and at term was registered. LGA was defined as birth weight > 2 standard deviations of the mean. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (OR’s) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for LGA. Results Over the 11-year period, we identified 308 singleton pregnancies in 221 women with T1DM and in 87 women with T2DM. The rate of LGA was 50% in women with T1DM and 23% in women with T2DM. The multivariable regression model identified gestational weight gain and second-trimester HbA1c as risk factors for LGA in T1DM pregnancies (OR = 1.107, 95% CI: 1.044–1.17, and OR = 1.047, 95% CI: 1.015–1.080, respectively) and gestational weight gain as a risk factor in T2DM pregnancies (OR = 1.175, 95% CI: 1.048–1.318), independent of body mass index. Conclusions Gestational weight gain was associated with LGA in women with T1DM and T2DM, independent of maternal body mass index. The findings suggest that monitoring and regulation of gestational weight gain is important in the clinical care of these women, to minimize the risk of fetal overgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2767283346,"Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) is a powerful tool transforming DNA analysis in multiple fields ranging from medicine, to environmental science, to evolutionary biology. In forensic applications, MPS offers the ability to significantly increase the discriminatory power of human identification as well as aid in mixture deconvolution. However, before the benefits of any new technology can be employed, a thorough evaluation of its quality, consistency, sensitivity, and specificity must be rigorously evaluated in order to gain a detailed understanding of the technique including sources of error, error rates, and other restrictions/limitations. This extensive study assessed the performance of Illumina’s MiSeq FGx MPS system and ForenSeq™ kit in nine experimental runs including 314 reaction samples. In-depth data analysis evaluated the consequences of different assay conditions on test results. Variables included: sample numbers per run, targets per run, DNA input per sample, and replications. Results are presented as heat maps revealing patterns for each locus. Data analysis focused on read numbers (allele coverage), drop-outs, drop-ins, and sequence analysis. The study revealed that loci with high read numbers performed better and resulted in fewer drop-outs and well balanced heterozygous alleles. Several loci were prone to drop-outs which led to falsely typed homozygotes and therefore to genotype errors. Sequence analysis of allele drop-in typically revealed a single nucleotide change (deletion, insertion, or substitution). Analyses of sequences, no template controls, and spurious alleles suggest no contamination during library preparation, pooling, and sequencing, but indicate that sequencing or PCR errors may have occurred due to DNA polymerase infidelities. Finally, we found utilizing Illumina’s FGx System at recommended conditions does not guarantee 100% outcomes for all samples tested, including the positive control, and required manual editing due to low read numbers and/or allele drop-in. These findings are important for progressing towards implementation of MPS in forensic DNA testing."
https://openalex.org/W2767431092,"Animals foraging in the wild have to balance speed of decision making and accuracy of assessment of a food item's quality. If resource quality is important for maximizing fitness, then the duration of decision making may be in conflict with other crucial and time consuming tasks, such as anti-predator behaviours or competition monitoring. Individuals facing the risk of predation and/or competition should adjust the duration of decision making and, as a consequence, their level of choosiness for resources. When exposed to predation, the forager could either maintain its level of choosiness for food items but accept a reduction in the amount of food items consumed or it could reduce its level of choosiness and accept all prey items encountered. Under competition risk, individuals are expected to reduce their level of choosiness as slow decision making exposes individuals to a higher risk of opportunity costs. To test these predictions, the level of choosiness of a seed-eating carabid beetle, Harpalus affinis, was examined under 4 different experimental conditions of risk: i) predation risk; ii) intraspecific competition; iii) interspecific competition; and, iv) control. All the risks were simulated using chemical cues from individual conspecifics or beetles of different species that are predatory or granivorous. Our results show that when foraging under the risk of predation, H. affinis individuals significantly reduce their level of choosiness for seeds. Reductions in level of choosiness for food items might serve as a sensible strategy to reduce both the total duration of a foraging task and the cognitive load of the food quality assessment. No significant differences were observed when individuals were exposed to competition cues. Competition, (i.e opportunity cost) may not be perceived as risk high enough to induce changes in the level of choosiness. Our results suggest that considering the amount of items consumed, alone, would be a misleading metric when assessing individual response to a risk of predation. Foraging studies should therefore also take in account the decision making process."
https://openalex.org/W2768061755,"Background With rapid expansion of antiretroviral therapy for HIV, there are rising life expectancies among people living with HIV. As a result, co-morbidity from non-communicable diseases in those living and aging with HIV is increasingly being reported. Published data on this issue have been limited in Cambodia. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and associated risk factors in adults living with HIV in Cambodia. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in five provinces of Cambodia from May-June 2015. Information was obtained on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire, and anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed with fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dl, hypertension with systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg and hypercholesterolemia with fasting blood cholesterol ≥190 mg/dl. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to explore risk factors. Results The study sample included 510 adults living with HIV; 67% were female, with a mean age of 45 (standard deviation = 8) years. Of these, 8.8% had diabetes mellitus, 15.1% had hypertension and 34.7% had hypercholesterolemia. Of the total participants with non-communicable diseases (n = 244), 47.8% had one or more diseases, and 75% were not aware of their diseases prior to the study: new disease was diagnosed in 90% of diabetes mellitus, 44% of hypertension and 90% of hypercholesterolemia. Single disease occurred in 81%, dual disease in 17% and triple disease in 2%. In adjusted analyses, those consuming 1 serving of fruit compare to 2 servings as significantly with diabetes mellitus, those eating 1 serving of fruit compare to 2 servings and using lard for cooking were significantly associated with hypertension, and those being unemployed, having monthly income less than 100 USD and being underweighted were significantly associated with hypercholesterolemia. Conclusions The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in adults living with HIV in this study was considerably high, with most of these diseases newly identified through active screening in the survey. These findings strongly suggest that screening of non-communicable diseases should be integrated into routine HIV care in Cambodia."
https://openalex.org/W2767408726,"Severe blunt chest trauma in humans is associated with high mortality rates. Whereas lung tissue damage and lung inflammation after blunt chest trauma have extensively been investigated, the traumatic and posttraumatic effects on the heart remain poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to define cardiac injury patterns in an experimental blunt chest trauma model in rats.Experimental blunt chest trauma was induced by a blast wave in rats, with subsequent analysis of its effects on the heart. The animals were subjected either to a sham or trauma procedure. Systemic markers for cardiac injury were determined after 24 h and 5 days. Postmortem analysis of heart tissue addressed structural injury and inflammation 24 h and 5 days after trauma.Plasma levels of extracellular histones were elevated 24 h and 5 days after blunt chest trauma compared to sham-treated animals. In the heart, up-regulation of interleukin-1β 24 h after trauma and increased myeloperoxidase activity 24 h and 5 days after trauma were accompanied by reduced complement C5a receptor-1 expression 24 h after trauma. Histological analysis revealed extravasation of erythrocytes and immunohistochemical analysis alteration of the pattern of the gap-junction protein connexin 43. Furthermore, a slight reduction of α-actinin and desmin expression in cardiac tissue was found after trauma together with a minor increase in sarcoplasmatic/endoplasmatic reticlulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) expression.The clinically highly relevant rat model of blast wave-induced blunt chest trauma is associated with cardiac inflammation and structural alterations in cardiac tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2767669926,"The matrix proteins of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm have not been well defined. Previous efforts to identify these proteins were performed using in vitro systems. Here we use a proteomic approach to identify biofilm matrix proteins directly from infected bone implants using a rat model of orthopedic implant-associated S. aureus infection. Despite heavy presence of host proteins, a total of 28 and 105 S. aureus proteins were identified during acute infection and chronic infection, respectively. Our results show that biofilm matrix contains mostly intracellular cytoplasmic proteins and, to a much less extent, extracellular and cell surface-associated proteins. Significantly, leukocidins were identified in the biofilm matrix during chronic infection, suggesting S. aureus is actively attacking the host immune system even though they are protected within the biofilm. The presence of two surface-associated proteins, Ebh and SasF, in the infected bone tissue during acute infection was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In addition, a large number of host proteins were found differentially expressed in response to S. aureus biofilm formed on bone implants."
https://openalex.org/W2768051671,"On sedation motivated by the clinical needs for safety and reliability, recent studies have attempted to identify brain-specific signatures for tracking patient transition into and out of consciousness, but the differences in neurophysiological effects between 1) the sedative types and 2) the presence/absence of surgical stimulations still remain unclear. Here we used multimodal electroencephalography–functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG–fNIRS) measurements to observe electrical and hemodynamic responses during sedation simultaneously. Forty healthy volunteers were instructed to push the button to administer sedatives in response to auditory stimuli every 9–11 s. To generally illustrate brain activity at repetitive transition points at the loss of consciousness (LOC) and the recovery of consciousness (ROC), patient-controlled sedation was performed using two different sedatives (midazolam (MDZ) and propofol (PPF)) under two surgical conditions. Once consciousness was lost via sedatives, we observed gradually increasing EEG power at lower frequencies (<15 Hz) and decreasing power at higher frequencies (>15 Hz), as well as spatially increased EEG powers in the delta and lower alpha bands, and particularly also in the upper alpha rhythm, at the frontal and parieto-occipital areas over time. During ROC from unconsciousness, these spatio-temporal changes were reversed. Interestingly, the level of consciousness was switched on/off at significantly higher effect-site concentrations of sedatives in the brain according to the use of surgical stimuli, but the spatio-temporal EEG patterns were similar, regardless of the sedative used. We also observed sudden phase shifts in fronto-parietal connectivity at the LOC and the ROC as critical points. fNIRS measurement also revealed mild hemodynamic fluctuations. Compared with general anesthesia, our results provide insights into critical hallmarks of sedative-induced (un)consciousness, which have similar spatio-temporal EEG-fNIRS patterns regardless of the stage and the sedative used."
https://openalex.org/W2767262406,"The invasive pest Drosophila suzukii was introduced to southern Europe in 2008 and spread throughout Central Europe in the following years. Precise reliable data on the temperature-dependent behavior of D. suzukii are scarce but will help forecasting and cultivation techniques. Depending on physico-chemical properties, surface temperature of objects may differ from ambient temperatures, determining physical activity, and affect oviposition on or into substrate, determining preimaginal development later. Therefore, the preferred ambient temperatures of D. suzukii and fruit temperature for oviposition were examined on a linear temperature gradient device. Thirty adults (15 ♀; 15 ♂) were adapted to different temperatures (10, 20, 30°C) for six days and then exposed to different temperature gradients (10-25, 20-35, 25-40°C). D. suzukii adapted to 10°C remained in cooler regions and suffered from a significantly higher mortality at the 25-40°C gradient. Animals adapted to warmer temperatures had a wider temperature preference on the gradient device. Acclimation to lower temperatures and the resulting lower temperature preferences may allow the flies to disperse better in spring to search for oviposition sites. The oviposition activity decreased continuously at a fruit temperature above 28°C and below 15°C, with highest oviposition activity in fruits with temperatures between 19.7°C and 24.8°C. The preferred fruit temperature is in accordance with the temperature optimum of reproduction biology and preimaginal development of D. suzukii reported in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2767676916,"Development of multidrug resistance (MDR) is a continuous clinical challenge partially due to the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. Herein, we evaluated the inhibitory potency of emodin, a natural anthraquinone derivative isolated from Rheum palmatum L, on P-gp in P-gp positive K562/ADM cells. Competition experiments combined with molecular docking analysis were utilized to investigate the binding modes between emodin and binding sites of P-gp. Emodin reversed adriamycin resistance in K562/ADM cells accompanied with the decrease of P-gp protein expression, further increasing the uptake of rhodamine123 in both K562/ADM and Caco-2 cells, indicating the inhibition of P-gp efflux function. Moreover, when incubated with emodin under different conditions where P-gp was inhibited, K562/ADM cells displayed increasing intracellular uptake of emodin, suggesting that emodin may be the potential substrate of P-gp. Importantly, rhodamine 123 could increase the Kintrinsic (Ki) value of emodin linearly, whereas, verapamil could not, implying that emodin competitively bound to the R site of P-gp and noncompetition existed between emodin and verapamil at the M site, in a good accordance with the results of molecular docking that emodin bound to the R site of P-gp with higher affinity. Based on our results, we suggest that emodin might be used to modulate P-gp function and expression."
https://openalex.org/W2767556098,"Background Cardiac rupture is an important cause of death in the acute phase after myocardial infarction (MI). Macrophages play a pivotal role in cardiac remodeling after MI. Apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) is secreted specifically by macrophages and contributes to macrophage accumulation in inflamed tissue by maintaining survival and recruiting macrophages. In this study, we evaluated the role of AIM in macrophage accumulation in the infarcted myocardium and cardiac rupture after MI. Methods and results Wild-type (WT) and AIM‒/‒ mice underwent permanent left coronary artery ligation and were followed-up for 7 days. Macrophage accumulation and phenotypes (M1 pro-inflammatory macrophage or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophage) were evaluated by immunohistological analysis and RT-PCR. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity levels were measured by gelatin zymography. The survival rate was significantly higher (81.1% vs. 48.2%, P<0.05), and the cardiac rupture rate was significantly lower in AIM‒/‒ mice than in WT mice (10.8% vs. 31.5%, P<0.05). The number of M1 macrophages and the expression levels of M1 markers (iNOS and IL-6) in the infarcted myocardium were significantly lower in AIM‒/‒ mice than in WT mice. In contrast, there was no difference in the number of M2 macrophages and the expression of M2 markers (Arg-1, CD206 and TGF-β1) between the two groups. The ratio of apoptotic macrophages in the total macrophages was significantly higher in AIM‒/‒ mice than in WT mice, although MCP-1 expression did not differ between the two groups. MMP-2 and 9 activity levels in the infarcted myocardium were significantly lower in AIM‒/‒ mice than in WT mice. Conclusions These findings suggest that AIM depletion decreases the levels of M1 macrophages, which are a potent source of MMP-2 and 9, in the infarcted myocardium in the acute phase after MI by promoting macrophage apoptosis, and leads to a decrease in the incidence of cardiac rupture and improvements in survival rates."
https://openalex.org/W2767867248,"HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) possesses both DNA polymerase activity and RNase H activity that act in concert to convert single-stranded RNA of the viral genome to double-stranded DNA that is then integrated into the DNA of the infected cell. Reverse transcriptase–catalyzed reverse transcription critically relies on the proper generation of a polypurine tract (PPT) primer. However, the mechanism of PPT primer generation and the features of the PPT sequence that are critical for its recognition by HIV-1 RT remain unclear. Here, we used a chemical cross-linking method together with molecular dynamics simulations and single-molecule assays to study the mechanism of PPT primer generation. We found that the PPT was specifically and properly recognized within covalently tethered HIV-1 RT–nucleic acid complexes. These findings indicated that recognition of the PPT occurs within a stable catalytic complex after its formation. We found that this unique recognition is based on two complementary elements that rely on the PPT sequence: RNase H sequence preference and incompatibility of the poly(rA/dT) tract of the PPT with the nucleic acid conformation that is required for RNase H cleavage. The latter results from rigidity of the poly(rA/dT) tract and leads to base-pair slippage of this sequence upon deformation into a catalytically relevant geometry. In summary, our results reveal an unexpected mechanism of PPT primer generation based on specific dynamic properties of the poly(rA/dT) segment and help advance our understanding of the mechanisms in viral RNA reverse transcription.

In summary, our results reveal an unexpected mechanism of PPT primer generation based on specific dynamic properties of the poly(rA/dT) segment and help advance our understanding of the mechanisms in viral RNA reverse transcription. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 3The abbreviations used are: HIV-1human immunodeficiency virus type 1RTreverse transcriptasePPTpolypurine tractMDmolecular dynamicsntnucleotide(s). is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is a retrovirus that encodes its genetic information in the form of single-stranded RNA, which must be converted to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) for integration into the genome of the infected cell (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Reverse transcriptase and the generation of retroviral DNA.in: Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). This process, termed reverse transcription, is a multistep reaction that, despite its complexity, is catalyzed by a single enzyme: reverse transcriptase (RT). Reverse transcriptases possess DNA polymerase activity and RNase H nucleolytic activity (2Le Grice S.F.J. Nowotny M. Reverse transcriptases.in: Murakami K. Trakselis M.A. Nucleic Acid Polymerases. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2014: 189-214Crossref Google Scholar). Polymerase activity is used to synthesize the DNA strand on an RNA or DNA template, and RNase H degrades the RNA strand of RNA/DNA hybrid intermediates of the reaction. The two enzymatic activities are coordinated and coupled. For example, RNase H cleavage sites are located ∼18 bp away from the polymerase active site (3Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J.

Moreover, the available crystal structures of HIV-1 RT reveal conformational changes in the RNA/DNA as an important element of the mechanism of HIV-1 RT. Two nucleic acid conformations have been observed. In each of these conformations, the substrate interacts with only one active site: DNA polymerase (polymerase mode) or RNase H (RNase H mode) (4Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C.

Recently, it has been shown biochemically that another conformation exists in which the substrate interacts with both active sites (7Li A. Li J. Johnson K.A. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase polymerase and RNase H active sites work simultaneously and independently.J. Biol.

Such conformation was termed “simultaneous mode,” and it was found to involve untwisting of the double helix and narrowing of the minor groove in the region of the substrate that interacts with the RNase H domain. HIV-1 RT functions as a heterodimer that consists of two subunits. p66 is the catalytic subunit with the polymerase and RNase H active sites, and p51 (a shorter version of p66) plays a structural role. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase polypurine tract molecular dynamics nucleotide(s). Retroviral RTs, including the enzyme from HIV-1, use a tRNA of the infected cell to prime the synthesis of the first DNA strand (9Marquet R. Isel C. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. tRNAs as primer of reverse transcriptases.Biochimie. 1995; 77 (7541250): 113-12410.1016/0300-9084(96)88114-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). An 18-nt region from the 3′ terminus of tRNA hybridizes with the primer-binding site of the viral RNA, which is located close to the 5′ end of the viral genome. A relatively short DNA fragment that comprises an “R” sequence is then synthesized (termed (−)-DNA) from the primer-binding site to the 5′ end of the RNA. During and after DNA synthesis, the complementary RNA strand is degraded by RNase H activity, which liberates the DNA to hybridize with another copy of the R sequence that is located in the 3′ portion of the viral RNA in a “strand transfer” step. Subsequent DNA polymerization leads to the synthesis of the full-length (−)-DNA strand while the RNase H continues to hydrolyze the RNA. Two copies (3′ and central) of an important region of the genome, termed the polypurine tract (PPT), are refractory to RNase H cleavage. They are left intact so they can be used as primers in the synthesis of the second DNA strand, termed (+)-DNA (10Huber H.E. Richardson C.C.

After synthesis of the first fragment of (+)-DNA, the second strand transfer event occurs in which (+)-DNA hybridizes with the 3′ end of (−)-DNA. (+)-DNA is further elongated to the central PPT where polymerization displaces the DNA all the way to the terminator sequence. The resulting overhang is removed by cellular enzymes. The dsDNA is integrated into the genome by retroviral integrase (12Delelis O. Carayon K. Saïb A. Deprez E. Mouscadet J.F.

The complexity of reverse transcription is likely derived from the fact that DNA synthesis requires priming. HIV-1 RT can efficiently extend only two types of RNA primers: tRNA for (−)-DNA synthesis and a PPT primer for (+)-DNA polymerization (10Huber H.E. Richardson C.C.

Single-molecule experiments have shown that HIV-1 RT can adopt two orientations when binding a primer hybridized to a longer DNA template (16Abbondanzieri E.A. Bokinsky G. Rausch J.W. Zhang J.X. Le Grice S.F. Zhuang X. Dynamic binding orientations direct activity of HIV reverse transcriptase.Nature. 2008; 453 (18464735): 184-18910.1038/nature06941Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). RNA primers were bound with an orientation that positions the RNase H domain for cleavage of the RNA strand but does not allow its extension by the polymerase. On DNA primers, the orientation of the enzyme was flipped, thus favoring extension of the 3′ end of the primer. The PPT RNA primer was unique because the RNA/DNA hybrid it formed could be bound by the enzyme in both orientations, the one compatible with RNase H cleavage and the one conducive to polymerization. This explained why the PPT can be extended and serve to initiate the synthesis of the (+)-DNA strand, thus playing a key role in HIV-1 proliferation (11Rausch J.W. Le Grice S.F. ‘Binding, bending and bonding': polypurine tract-primed initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis in human immunodeficiency virus.Int. J. Biochem.

Generation, extension, and removal of the 3′ PPT create one of the ends of the final dsDNA that is recognized by HIV-1 integrase and essential for incorporating viral genetic information into the genome of the host (17Pullen K.A. Champoux J.J. Plus-strand origin for human immunodeficiency virus type-1—implications for integration.J. Virol. 1990; 64 (2173791): 6274-6277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the PPT plays a critical role in the HIV-1 replication cycle. Polypurine tracts comprise 15 ribonucleotides, including a stretch of eight adenines with a single intervening guanine and a stretch of six guanines. In viral RNA, the PPT is located between a tract of five uridines (U-tract) and a sequence termed U3 (10Huber H.E. Richardson C.C.

Generation of the PPT primer relies on both protection of the body of the PPT from RNase H hydrolysis and the introduction of specific cuts at its termini (within the U-tract and at the PPT-U3 junction) (10Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. Processing of the primer for plus strand DNA synthesis by human immunodeficiency virus 1 reverse transcriptase.J. Biol.

The particular features of the PPT that are used for its recognition are unknown. As demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance, PPT RNA/DNA adopts an essentially regular, primarily A-form duplex structure with no evidence of unpairing or mispairing (18Yi-Brunozzi H.Y.

Moreover, the PPT is efficiently cleaved by cellular RNase H1 (10Huber H.E. Richardson C.C.

In fact, it is unclear whether the specific properties of the PPT are detected within the RT-nucleic acid complex or at the stage of its binding, leading to a particular register of the PPT interaction with the RT. In the present study, we used a unique approach that combined enzymatic studies of chemically cross-linked RT-substrate complexes with single-molecule experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study PPT generation. We found that the PPT sequence was recognized within the stable HIV-1 RT–substrate complex and not at the stage of the complex formation. This recognition was based on two elements: RNase H cleavage sequence preference and incompatibility of the poly(rA/dT) tract of the PPT with the conformation that is required for RNase H cleavage. The latter was the dominant mechanism that resulted from higher rigidity of the poly(rA/dT) sequence and its slippage upon deformation. Our results revealed an unexpected mechanism of PPT generation that utilizes a unique indirect readout of the homopolymeric nucleic acid sequence that relies on specific dynamic properties of the poly(rA/dT) segment. To study PPT recognition by HIV-1 RT, we prepared chemically cross-linked complexes of the protein with RNA/DNA hybrid substrates. This approach allowed us to monitor cleavage events independently of the substrate binding step and at defined sites in the substrates. The cross-linking reaction involved the formation of a disulfide bond between a cysteine residue that was introduced into the protein sequence and a thiol group that was introduced into the base of the DNA strand of the substrate (Fig. S1) (20Huang H. Harrison S.C. Verdine G.L. Trapping of a catalytic HIV reverse transcriptase*template:primer complex through a disulfide bond.Chem.

DNA modification was performed by introducing 2-fluoroinosine into the DNA oligonucleotide followed by reaction with cystamine, whose amine group substituted the fluorine atom (see “Experimental procedures”). We used a well established tethering protocol with a Q258C variant of HIV-1 RT and a hybrid substrate that was modified on the sixth DNA base from the 3′ end (4Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L.

This approach is compatible with all modes: polymerase, RNase H, and simultaneous (8Figiel M. Krepl M. Poznanski J. Golab A. Šponer J. Nowotny M.

Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Structure of a covalently trapped catalytic complex of HIV-I reverse transcriptase: implications for drug resistance.Science. 1998; 282 (9831551): 1669-167510.1126/science.282.5394.1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 6Das K.

We prepared RNA/DNA hybrids with a double-stranded region of 24 bp and a 6-nt 5′ overhang in the RNA strand. The overhang was introduced to promote the binding of the 3′ end of the DNA primer at the polymerase active site, thus positioning the substrate for cross-linking. The RNA strand contained terminal fluorophores to visualize the cleavage products. Generation of the PPT involves protection of its body from RNase H cleavage and introduction of cuts at its termini. To monitor both elements, we used substrates with sequences that corresponded to the sequence of the PPT in two registers (Fig. 1, A and B). When the first substrate (PPT1) was cross-linked with HIV-1 RT, the RNase H active site was positioned at the proper cleavage site at the PPT-U3 junction. In the second sequence (PPT2), the register was shifted, positioning the RNase H active site in the middle of the PPT sequence within the G-tract where cleavage should not occur. Cross-linked complexes were purified (Fig. S2) and used in RNase H cleavage assays, an approach that we developed previously (8Figiel M. Krepl M. Poznanski J. Golab A. Šponer J. Nowotny M. Coordination between the polymerase and RNase H activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28108662): 3341-3352PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the observed cleavage events resulted only from the reaction that was catalyzed by covalently bound complexes, we used heparin as a substrate competitor (trap) or a high NaCl concentration, which prevents protein-RNA/DNA interactions (8Figiel M. Krepl M. Poznanski J. Golab A. Šponer J. Nowotny M. Coordination between the polymerase and RNase H activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28108662): 3341-3352PubMed Google Scholar). We performed time-course experiments for RNase H cleavage within cross-linked complexes for times between 30 s and 20 min for complexes alone and in the presence of 3 mg/ml heparin or 0.5 m NaCl. RNase H cleavage occurred at the expected position, 18 nt from the polymerase active site (Fig. 1C). Additional cuts 17 nt from the polymerase active site were also observed, which we interpreted to result from conformational flexibility of the HIV-1 RT–substrate complex (see “Discussion”). Upon pretreatment of the complexes with 20 mm DTT, which caused breakage of the disulfide cross-link in a fraction of the complexes, new cleavage products were observed (Fig. 1C, lanes marked “D”), resulting from the free enzyme that dissociated from the substrate and bound it with a different register. However, in the presence of high salt concentration or heparin, DTT-pretreated reactions were inhibited, and off-register cleavages were completely eliminated, confirming the validity of our experimental approach. Densitometric quantification of the reaction products in each sample (Fig. S3) demonstrated that PPT1 reactions without heparin and with low NaCl concentration proceeded to a similar extent for the cross-linked complex and for the complex in which the cross-link was broken by the addition of DTT. The reactions with PPT2 substrates were markedly less efficient than with PPT1, demonstrating that the body of the PPT sequence was refractory to cleavage within the covalently tethered protein-nucleic acid complex. This important result indicated that PPT recognition occurs within a stable/catalytic HIV-1 RT–nucleic acid complex that can form either by association between the substrate and the protein or by stopping the sliding of the enzyme on the RNA/DNA duplex (21Liu S. Abbondanzieri E.A. Rausch J.W. Le Grice S.F. Zhuang X. Slide into action: dynamic shuttling of HIV reverse transcriptase on nucleic acid substrates.Science. 2008; 322 (19008444): 1092-109710.1126/science.1163108Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To further verify that preferential binding of the PPT sequence in a particular register does not contribute to the mechanism of PPT generation, we measured the dissociation constants for the interactions between the PPT1 and PPT2 substrates and wild-type HIV-1 RT (Fig. S4). Both values were similar (2.6 nm for PPT1 and 3.7 nm for PPT2), indicating that the enzyme can bind the PPT sequence in both registers equally well. Collectively, these results showed that generation of the PPT does not rely on the binding of RNA/DNA in a particular register but rather depends on events that occur after the formation of a stable protein-nucleic acid complex. To further explore the mechanism that underlies PPT generation, we performed time-course experiments for various substrates in the presence of heparin and with additional time points within the 7.5-s to 16-min range for kinetic analysis. The products of the reaction within the cross-linked complexes were resolved on acrylamide gels and visualized by fluorescence. For each sample, the amount of the cleavage products was expressed as their fluorescence signal divided by the fluorescence of all bands in the lane. This normalized the measurement and removed the effect of any inaccuracies in the quantification of the amount of each complex and gel loading and/or differences in fluorescent properties of the various substrates we used. The extent of the reaction at each time point was fit to a pseudo-zero-order reaction model. PPT1 was cleaved too rapidly for the half-life (t½) to be reliably determined, but it was estimated to be less than 3 s. For PPT2, t½ was 20.8 ± 5.3 min, confirming that the PPT in this register was a poor substrate (Fig. 2, Figs. S5 and S6, and Table S1). The HIV-1 RNase H domain has been reported to have substrate sequence preference for cleavage (22Pullen K.A. Rattray A.J. Champoux J.J.

The following consensus in the vicinity of the cleavage site was identified: A or U for position +1; G or C for position −2; and C, G, or U for position −4. In all of our analyses, we used nucleotide numbering relative to the preferred RNase H cleavage site 18 nt from the 3′ end of the DNA primer (Fig. 1B). The RNase H consensus was perfectly matched for the PPT1 substrate, but PPT2 contained non-preferred residues in the relevant positions. Therefore, to test the contribution of RNase H sequence preference to PPT recognition, we designed three substrates with a random sequence but specific residues in consensus positions +1, −2, and −4 (Fig. 2A). CL4 had a perfect match with the consensus and was cleaved too rapidly for reliable t½ determination. CL5 had two non-matching residues and was cleaved with t½ = 6.2 ± 0.6 s. CL6 had three non-matching residues and was cleaved with t½ = 9.7 ± 1.8 s (Fig. 2). These results show that RNase H sequence preference contributed to PPT recognition, but even the poorest substrate of the three was cut ∼100-fold faster than PPT2, indicating the involvement of other factors. PPT1 and CL4 substrates were cleaved too fast for reliable half-life estimation. Therefore, for cross-linked complexes of these two hybrids, we performed quenched-flow experiments in the 10-ms to 10-s time range as described previously (8Figiel M. Krepl M. Poznanski J. Golab A. Šponer J. Nowotny M. Coordination between the polymerase and RNase H activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28108662): 3341-3352PubMed Google Scholar). Both substrates showed biexponential decay, and the determined t½ values for the major reaction were 0.20 ± 0.01 and 0.18 ± 0.03 s for PPT1 and CL4, respectively (Fig. S7 and Table S1). Therefore, these substrates are cleaved at a very similar rate. In our RNase H cleavage experiments, we observed gradual accumulation of the product until a plateau was reached when there was no more processable substrate available. This gradual reaction progress is in agreement with the fact that in the cross-linked complexes the substrate is not preorganized at the RNase H active site and for the RNA cleavage a conformational change is required. This change constitutes an energy barrier and occurs stochastically, resulting in gradual product generation. Our previous results showed that the conformational change occurs mostly in the portion of the hybrid immediately upstream of the cleavage site (8Figiel M. Krepl M. Poznanski J. Golab A. Šponer J.

Methods 1000 combined dermoscopy-RCM image sets were evaluated in blind by 10 readers with advanced training and internship in dermoscopy and RCM evaluation. We compared sensitivity and specificity of single reader evaluation versus double reader concordance evaluation as well as the effect of diagnostic confidence on lesion management in a retrospective setting. Results Single reader evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 95.2% and specificity of 76.3%, with misdiagnosis of 8 melanomas, 4 basal cell carcinomas and 2 squamous cell carcinomas. Combined double reader evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 98.3% and specificity of 65.5%, with misdiagnosis of 1 in-situ melanoma and 2 basal cell carcinomas. Conclusion Evaluation of dermoscopy-RCM image sets of cutaneous lesions by single reader evaluation in retrospective settings is limited by sensitivity levels that may result in potential mismanagement of malignant lesions. Double reader blind concordance evaluation may improve the sensitivity of diagnosis and management safety. The use of a second check can be implemented in telemedicine settings where expert consultation and second opinions may be required."
https://openalex.org/W2767846703,"Facial Width-to-Height Ratio (fWHR) has been linked with dominant and aggressive behavior in human males. We show here that on portrait photographs published online, chief executive officers (CEOs) of companies listed in the Dow Jones stock market index and the Deutscher Aktienindex have a higher-than-normal fWHR, which also correlates positively with their company’s donations to charitable causes and environmental awareness. Furthermore, we show that leaders of the world’s most influential non-governmental organizations and even the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church, the popes, have higher fWHR compared to controls on public portraits, suggesting that the relationship between displayed fWHR and leadership is not limited to profit-seeking organizations. The data speak against the simplistic view that wider-faced men achieve higher social status through antisocial tendencies and overt aggression, or the mere signaling of such dispositions. Instead they suggest that high fWHR is linked with high social rank in a more subtle fashion in both competitive as well as prosocially oriented settings."
https://openalex.org/W2768013823,"Background Elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery (HFS) are at increased risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE). To reduce this risk, combined postoperative mechanical and chemical thromboprophylaxis has been routinely performed after HFS in these patients. This retrospective case-control study was conducted to evaluate the additional effectiveness of preoperative mechanical thromboprophylaxis for the prevention of VTE following HFS in elderly patients. Methods Of 539 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older undergoing HFS, 404 (control group) did not receive preoperative mechanical thromboprophylaxis, while 135 (study group) received mechanical thromboprophylaxis using an intermittent pneumatic compression device and graduated compression stockings from the time of admission until surgery. All patients received combined postoperative mechanical and chemical thromboprophylaxis following HFS in accordance with the same protocol. The incidence of symptomatic VTE confirmed based on clinical symptoms and 3-dimensional CT angiography within one month of surgery was investigated in both groups. Results The American Society of Anesthesiologists grade was higher (p = 0.016) in the study group and more patients in this group had concomitant cardiovascular and neurologic diseases (p = 0.005 and p = 0.009, respectively). In addition, more patients in the study group had received anticoagulant medication preinjury owing to comorbidities (39% vs 28%, p = 0.025). The overall incidences of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were 7.4% and 3.7%, and 2.2% and 1.5% in the control and study groups, respectively. According to multiple logistic regression, symptomatic DVT significantly reduced in the study group (OR 0.28, p = 0.042), while there was no significant difference in the incidence of symptomatic PE between the two groups (p = 0.223). Conclusions Preoperative mechanical thromboprophylaxis may confer an additional benefit by preventing postoperative VTE without adding more risk of perioperative bleeding in elderly patients with hip fracture."
https://openalex.org/W2767444753,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) depends on and modulates multiple host cell membrane proteins during each stage of the viral life cycle. To gain a global view of the impact of HCMV-infection on membrane proteins, we analyzed HCMV-induced changes in the abundance of membrane proteins in fibroblasts using stable isotope labeling with amino acids (SILAC), membrane fractionation and protein identification by two-dimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. This systematic approach revealed that CD81, CD44, CD98, caveolin-1 and catenin delta-1 were down-regulated during infection whereas GRP-78 was up-regulated. Since CD81 downregulation was also observed during infection with UV-inactivated virus we hypothesized that this tetraspanin is part of the viral entry process. Interestingly, additional members of the tetraspanin family, CD9 and CD151, were also downregulated during HCMV-entry. Since tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEM) cluster host cell membrane proteins including known CMV receptors such as integrins, we studied whether TEMs are required for viral entry. When TEMs were disrupted with the cholesterol chelator methyl-β-cylcodextrin, viral entry was inhibited and this inhibition correlated with reduced surface levels of CD81, CD9 and CD151, whereas integrin levels remained unchanged. Furthermore, simultaneous siRNA-mediated knockdown of multiple tetraspanins inhibited viral entry whereas individual knockdown had little effect suggesting essential, but redundant roles for individual tetraspanins during entry. Taken together, our data suggest that TEM act as platforms for receptors utilized by HCMV for entry into cells."
https://openalex.org/W2767630106,"The energy available from the diet, which affects fat deposition in vivo, is a major factor in the expression of genes regulating fat deposition in the longissimus dorsi muscle. Providing high-energy diets to yaks might increase intramuscular fat deposition and fatty acid concentrations under a traditional grazing system in cold seasons. A total of fifteen adult castrated male yaks with an initial body weight 274.3 ± 3.14 kg were analyzed for intramuscular adipose deposition and fatty acid composition. The animals were divided into three groups and fed low-energy (LE: 5.5 MJ/kg), medium-energy (ME: 6.2 MJ/kg) and high-energy (HE: 6.9 MJ/kg) diets, respectively. All animals were fed ad libitum twice daily at 08:00–09:00 am and 17:00–18:00 pm and with free access to water for 74 days, including a 14-d period to adapt to the diets and the environment. Intramuscular fat (IMF) content, fatty acid profile and mRNA levels of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis were determined. The energy levels of the diets significantly (P<0.05) affected the content of IMF, total SFA, total MUFA and total PUFA. C16:0, C18:0 and C18:1n9c account for a large proportion of total fatty acids. Relative expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) was greater in HE than in LE yaks (P<0.05). Moreover, ME yaks had higher (P<0.05) mRNA expression levels of PPARγ, ACACA, FASN, SCD and FABP4 than did the LE yaks. The results demonstrate that the higher energy level of the diets increased IMF deposition and fatty acid content as well as increased intramuscular lipogenic gene expression during the experimental period."
https://openalex.org/W2768085208,"Fluctuations in environmental parameters are increasingly being recognized as essential features of any habitat. The quantification of whether environmental fluctuations are prevalently predictable or unpredictable is remarkably relevant to understanding the evolutionary responses of organisms. However, when characterizing the relevant features of natural habitats, ecologists typically face two problems: (1) gathering long-term data and (2) handling the hard-won data. This paper takes advantage of the free access to long-term recordings of remote sensing data (27 years, Landsat TM/ETM+) to assess a set of environmental models for estimating environmental predictability. The case study included 20 Mediterranean saline ponds and lakes, and the focal variable was the water-surface area. This study first aimed to produce a method for accurately estimating the water-surface area from satellite images. Saline ponds can develop salt-crusted areas that make it difficult to distinguish between soil and water. This challenge was addressed using a novel pipeline that combines band ratio water indices and the short near-infrared band as a salt filter. The study then extracted the predictable and unpredictable components of variation in the water-surface area. Two different approaches, each showing variations in the parameters, were used to obtain the stochastic variation around a regular pattern with the objective of dissecting the effect of assumptions on predictability estimations. The first approach, which is based on Colwell's predictability metrics, transforms the focal variable into a nominal one. The resulting discrete categories define the relevant variations in the water-surface area. In the second approach, we introduced General Additive Model (GAM) fitting as a new metric for quantifying predictability. Both approaches produced a wide range of predictability for the studied ponds. Some model assumptions-which are considered very different a priori-had minor effects, whereas others produced predictability estimations that showed some degree of divergence. We hypothesize that these diverging estimations of predictability reflect the effect of fluctuations on different types of organisms. The fluctuation analysis described in this manuscript is applicable to a wide variety of systems, including both aquatic and non-aquatic systems, and will be valuable for quantifying and characterizing predictability, which is essential within the expected global increase in the unpredictability of environmental fluctuations. We advocate that a priori information for organisms of interest should be used to select the most suitable metrics for estimating predictability, and we provide some guidelines for this approach."
https://openalex.org/W2767577817,"Busulphan (Bu) is an alkylating agent used in the conditioning regimen prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Bu is extensively metabolized in the liver via conjugations with glutathione to form the intermediate metabolite (sulfonium ion) which subsequently is degraded to tetrahydrothiophene (THT). THT was reported to be oxidized forming THT-1-oxide that is further oxidized to sulfolane and finally 3-hydroxysulfolane. However, the underlying mechanisms for the formation of these metabolites remain poorly understood. In the present study, we performed in vitro and in vivo investigations to elucidate the involvement of flavin-containing monooxygenase-3 (FMO3) and cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) in Bu metabolic pathway. Rapid clearance of THT was observed when incubated with human liver microsomes. Furthermore, among different recombinant microsomal enzymes, the highest intrinsic clearance for THT was obtained via FMO3 followed by several CYPs including 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2E1 and 3A4. In Bu- or THT-treated mice, inhibition of FMO3 by phenylthiourea significantly suppressed the clearance of both Bu and THT. Moreover, the simultaneous administration of a high dose of THT (200μmol/kg) to Bu-treated mice reduced the clearance of Bu. Consistently, in patients undergoing HSCT, repeated administration of Bu resulted in a significant up-regulation of FMO3 and glutathione-S-transfrase -1 (GSTA1) genes. Finally, in a Bu-treated patient, additional treatment with voriconazole (an antimycotic drug known as an FMO3-substrate) significantly altered the Bu clearance. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that FMO3 along with CYPs contribute a major part in busulphan metabolic pathway and certainly can affect its kinetics. The present results have high clinical impact. Furthermore, these findings might be important for reducing the treatment-related toxicity of Bu, through avoiding interaction with other concomitant used drugs during conditioning and hence improving the clinical outcomes of HSCT."
https://openalex.org/W2268316672,"HIV treatment has reduced morbidity and mortality. By 2012, it was estimated that 60.4% of eligible South Africans accessed antiretroviral treatment; however, treatment adherence and retention remain the greatest challenges. There is a growing belief that social capital, seen as ""the features of social organization that facilitate cooperation for mutual benefit"", is important in promoting HIV treatment retention. The aim of this study was to establish whether social capital is associated with HIV treatment outcomes.This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from a cohort study that investigated how patient outcomes were linked to clinical characteristics, and included exploratory factor and logistic regression analysis. Data from 943 patients were analyzed. Outcomes for the analysis were visit non-adherence, unsuppressed viral load, and treatment failure. Sixteen percent of patients (n = 118) had unsuppressed viral loads; 19% (n = 179) were non-adherent; and 32% (n = 302) experienced treatment failure. Social capital had two dimensions that were described by two factors. There was no association between either factor and visit non-adherence. Social capital factor 1 was marginally associated with lower risks of unsuppressed viral load and treatment failure at 12 months (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.58-1.03 and OR = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.62-0.93, respectively); but not with visit non-adherence (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.71-1.22). After controlling for confounders, the odds of both unsuppressed viral load and treatment failure decreased with an increase in social capital factor 1.This study suggests that social capital, in terms of the number of groups to which an HIV-infected person belongs, the diversity of the groups, availability of child support, and time available for community projects, is protective against poor HIV treatment outcomes. Implementers and policy makers in the areas of HIV treatment and prevention need to consider the inclusion of social capital in the design of HIV/AIDS treatment program."
https://openalex.org/W2767456518,"Health care workers (HCWs) are frequently exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The efficacy and safety of immunization with the hepatitis B (HB) vaccine are well recognized, but the durability of immunity and need for booster doses in those with secondary vaccine response failure remains controversial.This was a retrospective cohort study performed at Osaka University Hospital, Japan. We examined antibodies against HB surface antigen (anti-HBs) titers annually after immunization for previously non-immunized HCWs. Primary responders were categorized by their sero-positive durations as short responders (those whose anti-HBs titers declined to negative range within 3 years), and long responders (those who retained positive anti-HBs levels for 3 years and more). We re-immunized short responders with either single or 3-dose boosters, the long responders with a single booster when their titers dropped below protective levels, and examined their sero-protection rates over time thereafter.From 2001 to 2012, data of 264 HCWs with a median age of 25.3 were collected. The rate of anti-HBs positivity after primary vaccination were 93.0% after three doses (n = 229), 54.5% after two doses (n = 11), and 4.2% after a single dose (n = 24). Of 213 primary responders, the anti-HBs levels of 95 participants (44.6%) fell below the protective levels, including 46 short responders and 49 long responders. HCWs with higher initial anti-HBs titers after primary vaccination had significantly longer durations of sero-positivity. For short responders, 3-dose booster vaccination induced a longer duration of anti-HBs positivity compared to a single-dose booster, whereas for long responders, a single-dose booster alone could induce prolonged anti-HBs positivity.Our preliminary data suggested that it may be useful to differentiate HB vaccine responders based on their primary response durations to maintain protective levels of anti-HBs efficiently. A randomized, prospective, large-scale study is warranted to support our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2767646384,"The production and cultivation of hybrid wheat is a possible strategy to close the yield gap in wheat. Efficient hybrid wheat seed production largely depends on high rates of cross-pollination which can be ensured through high anther extrusion (AE) by male parental lines. Here, we report the AE capacity and elucidate its genetics in 514 elite European winter wheat varieties via genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We observed a wide range of variation among genotypes and a high heritability (0.80) for AE. The whole panel was genotyped with the 35k Affymetrix and 90k iSELECT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays plus Ppd-D1, Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 candidate markers. GWAS revealed 51 marker-trait associations (MTAs) on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 4D and 5B, with Rht-D1 (4D) being the most significant marker. Division of whole panel according to the Rht-D1 genotype resulted in 212 and 294 varieties harboring Rht-D1a and Rht-D1b allele, respectively. The presence of Rht-D1a compared to Rht-D1b (mutant) allele had a large phenotypic influence on AE resulting in its ~17% increase. GWAS performed on the sub-panels detected novel MTAs on chromosomes 2D, 3B and 6A with increased phenotypic variance imparted by individual markers. Our study shows that AE is a highly quantitative trait and wild type Rht-D1a allele greatly improves AE. Moreover, demarcating the quantitative trait loci regions based on intra-chromosomal linkage disequilibrium revealed AE’s candidate genes/genomic regions. Understanding the genetics of AE in elite European wheat and utilizing the linked markers in breeding programs can help to enhance cross-pollination for better exploitation of heterosis."
https://openalex.org/W2767749496,"Volume loss in some limbic region structures has been observed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, in vivo evaluation of existing tissue cellular microstructure integrity has received less attention. The goal of studies reported here was to quantitatively assess loss of limbic system volumes and tissue integrity, and to evaluate associations of these measures with cognitive and physical dysfunction in MS patients. Thirty-one healthy controls (HC) and 80 MS patients, including 32 relapsing remitting (RRMS), 32 secondary progressive (SPMS) and 16 primary progressive (PPMS), participated in this study. Tissue cellular integrity was evaluated by means of recently introduced tissue-specific parameter R2t* that was calculated from multi-gradient-echo MRI signals using a recently developed method that separates R2t* from BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) contributions to GRE signal decay rate constant (R2*), and accounting for physiological fluctuations and artifacts from background gradients. Volumes in limbic system regions, normalized to skull size (NV), were measured from standard MPRAGE images. MS patients had lower R2t* and smaller normalized volumes in the hippocampus, amygdala, and several other limbic system regions, compared to HC. Alterations in R2t* of several limbic system regions correlated with clinical and neurocognitive test scores in MS patients. In contrast, smaller normalized volumes in MS were only correlated with neurocognitive test scores in the hippocampus and amygdala. This study reports the novel finding that R2t*, a measure that estimates tissue integrity, is more sensitive to tissue damage in limbic system structures than is atrophy. R2t* measurements can serve as a biomarker that is distinct from and complementary to volume measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2767653851,"Most theories of social exchange distinguish between two different types of cooperation, depending on whether or not cooperation occurs conditional upon the partner’s previous behaviors. Here, we used a multinomial processing tree model to distinguish between positive and negative reciprocity and cooperation bias in a sequential Prisoner’s Dilemma game. In Experiments 1 and 2, the facial expressions of the partners were varied to manipulate cooperation bias. In Experiment 3, an extinction instruction was used to manipulate reciprocity. The results confirm that people show a stronger cooperation bias when interacting with smiling compared to angry-looking partners, supporting the notion that a smiling facial expression in comparison to an angry facial expression helps to construe a situation as cooperative rather than competitive. Reciprocity was enhanced for appearance-incongruent behaviors, but only when participants were encouraged to form expectations about the partners’ future behaviors. Negative reciprocity was not stronger than positive reciprocity, regardless of whether expectations were manipulated or not. Experiment 3 suggests that people are able to ignore previous episodes of cheating as well as previous episodes of cooperation if these turn out to be irrelevant for predicting a partner’s future behavior. The results provide important insights into the mechanisms of social cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W2768056892,"Background Despite the reduction in reported incidence of tuberculosis globally, the burden of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) remains high in low- and middle- income countries, including China. The current study aims to evaluate the distribution and trend of PTB incidence in Xinjiang, the region with the highest PTB burden in China. Methods We identified all confirmed PTB case records reported to the Chinese TB Information Management System (TBIMS) between 2011 and 2015. We analyzed these records to measure the annual incidence of reported smear-positive PTB cases in Xinjiang and its trend over time. We also analyzed incidence by gender, residential area, and region. Spatial analysis was used to describe the inter-regional disparity of the disease burden during the study period. Results We identified 212,216 smear-positive PTB cases between 2011 and 2015. The reported incidence increased from 180.8 cases in 2011 to 195.8 cases in 2015 per 100,000 population. The southern region of Xinjiang had the highest disease burden (257.8/100,000 in 2011 and 312.7/100,000 in 2015). More than 60% cases occurred in persons >45 years, and 76% of cases lived in rural areas. Conclusion To reach the goal of elimination and control of TB, more comprehensive STOP TB strategies should be implemented in Xinjiang. Residents in the southern region and rural areas of Xinjiang require particular attention."
https://openalex.org/W2767390402,"The small GTPases of the Rho family comprising RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 function as molecular switches controlling several essential biochemical pathways in eukaryotic cells. Their activity is cycling between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound conformation. The exchange of GDP to GTP is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Here we report a novel regulatory mechanism of Rac1 activity, which is controlled by a phosphomimetic (Ser179Glu) mutant of syndecan-4 (SDC4). SDC4 is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane, heparan sulfate proteoglycan. In this study we show that the Ser179Glu mutant binds strongly Tiam1, a Rac1-GEF reducing Rac1-GTP by 3-fold in MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. Mutational analysis unravels the PDZ interaction between SDC4 and Tiam1 is indispensable for the suppression of the Rac1 activity. Neither of the SDC4 interactions is effective alone to block the Rac1 activity, on the contrary, lack of either of interactions can increase the activity of Rac1, therefore the Rac1 activity is the resultant of the inhibitory and stimulatory effects. In addition, SDC4 can bind and tether RhoGDI1 (GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1) to the membrane. Expression of the phosphomimetic SDC4 results in the accumulation of the Rac1-RhoGDI1 complex. Co-immunoprecipitation assays (co-IP-s) reveal that SDC4 can form complexes with RhoGDI1. Together, the regulation of the basal activity of Rac1 is fine tuned and SDC4 is implicated in multiple ways."
https://openalex.org/W2767421114,"Background DSC is used to determine thermally-induced conformational changes of biomolecules within a blood plasma sample. Recent research has indicated that DSC curves (or thermograms) may have different characteristics based on disease status and, thus, may be useful as a monitoring and diagnostic tool for some diseases. Since thermograms are curves measured over a range of temperature values, they are considered functional data. In this paper we apply functional data analysis techniques to analyze differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data from individuals from the Lupus Family Registry and Repository (LFRR). The aim was to assess the effect of lupus disease status as well as additional covariates on the thermogram profiles, and use FD analysis methods to create models for classifying lupus vs. control patients on the basis of the thermogram curves. Methods Thermograms were collected for 300 lupus patients and 300 controls without lupus who were matched with diseased individuals based on sex, race, and age. First, functional regression with a functional response (DSC) and categorical predictor (disease status) was used to determine how thermogram curve structure varied according to disease status and other covariates including sex, race, and year of birth. Next, functional logistic regression with disease status as the response and functional principal component analysis (FPCA) scores as the predictors was used to model the effect of thermogram structure on disease status prediction. The prediction accuracy for patients with Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis but without Lupus was also calculated to determine the ability of the classifier to differentiate between Lupus and other diseases. Data were divided 1000 times into separate 2/3 training and 1/3 test data for evaluation of predictions. Finally, derivatives of thermogram curves were included in the models to determine whether they aided in prediction of disease status. Results Functional regression with thermogram as a functional response and disease status as predictor showed a clear separation in thermogram curve structure between cases and controls. The logistic regression model with FPCA scores as the predictors gave the most accurate results with a mean 79.22% correct classification rate with a mean sensitivity = 79.70%, and specificity = 81.48%. The model correctly classified OA and RA patients without Lupus as controls at a rate of 75.92% on average with a mean sensitivity = 79.70% and specificity = 77.6%. Regression models including FPCA scores for derivative curves did not perform as well, nor did regression models including covariates. Conclusion Changes in thermograms observed in the disease state likely reflect covalent modifications of plasma proteins or changes in large protein-protein interacting networks resulting in the stabilization of plasma proteins towards thermal denaturation. By relating functional principal components from thermograms to disease status, our Functional Principal Component Analysis model provides results that are more easily interpretable compared to prior studies. Further, the model could also potentially be coupled with other biomarkers to improve diagnostic classification for lupus."
https://openalex.org/W2767730337,"Cowpox virus infections in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) with high morbidity and mortality have already been reported in the UK and Russia in the 1970s. However, most of the reported cases have been singular events. Here, we report a total of five cowpox virus outbreaks in cheetahs in the same safari park in Denmark between 2010 and 2014. Nine cheetahs showed varying severity of clinical disease; two of them died (22%). All episodes occurred between August and October of the respective year. No other carnivores kept at the same institution nor the keepers taking care of the animals were clinically affected. The clinical picture of cowpox was confirmed by extensive laboratory investigations including histopathological and molecular analyses as well as cell culture isolation of a cowpox virus. High anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers were detected in all 9 diseased cheetahs compared to seven contact cheetahs without clinical signs and 13 cheetahs not in direct contact. Additionally, whole genome sequencing from one sample of each cluster with subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from different outbreaks have individual sequences but clearly form a clade distinct from other cowpox viruses. However, the intra-clade distances are still larger than those usually observed within clades of one event. These findings indicate multiple and separate introductions of cowpox virus, probably from wild rodent populations, where the virus keeps circulating naturally and is only sporadically introduced into the cheetahs. Sero-positivity of voles (Arvicola amphibious) caught in zoo grounds strengthens this hypothesis. As a consequence, recommendations are given for medical and physical management of diseased cheetahs, for hygienic measures as well as for pre-shipment isolation before cheetah export from zoo grounds."
https://openalex.org/W2767821940,"Background Insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and overt diabetes are known metabolic complications associated with chronic use of HIV-Protease Inhibitors. Naringin is a grapefruit-derived flavonoid with anti-diabetic, anti-dyslipidemia, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Objectives The study investigated the protective effects of naringin on glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion and signaling in vivo. Methods Male Wistar rats were divided into six groups (n = 6) and were daily orally treated with distilled water {3.0 ml/kg body weight (BW)}, atazanavir (133 mg/kg BW), saquinavir (333 mg/kg BW) with or without naringin (50 mg/kg BW), respectively for 56 days. Body weights and water consumption were recorded daily. Glucose tolerance tests were carried out on day 55 of the treatment and thereafter, the rats were sacrificed by halothane overdose. Results Atazanavir (ATV)- or saquinavir (SQV)-treated rats exhibited significant weight loss, polydipsia, elevated Fasting blood glucose (FBG), reduced Fasting Plasma Insulin (FPI) and expression of phosphorylated, Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Akt proteins, hepatic and pancreatic glucokinase levels, and also increasing pancreatic caspase-3 and -9 as well as UCP2 protein expressions compared to controls, respectively. These effects were completely reversed by naringin treatment. Conclusion Naringin prevents PI-induced glucose intolerance and impairment of insulin signaling and as nutritional supplement it could therefore alleviate metabolic complications associated with antiretroviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2767366342,"Binding of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) to its receptor RANK on osteoclast (OC) precursors up-regulates c-Fos and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα), two critical OC transcription factors. However, the effects of c-Fos and C/EBPα on osteoclastogenesis have not been compared. Herein, we demonstrate that overexpression of c-Fos or C/EBPα in OC precursors up-regulates OC genes and initiates osteoclastogenesis independently of RANKL. However, although C/EBPα up-regulated c-Fos, c-Fos failed to up-regulate C/EBPα in OC precursors. Consistently, C/EBPα overexpression more strongly promoted OC differentiation than did c-Fos overexpression. RANK has a cytoplasmic 535IVVY538 (IVVY) motif that is essential for osteoclastogenesis, and we found that mutation of the IVVY motif blocked OC differentiation by partly inhibiting expression of C/EBPα but not expression of c-Fos. We therefore hypothesized that C/EBPα overexpression might rescue osteoclastogenesis in cells expressing the mutated IVVY motif. However, overexpression of C/EBPα or c-Fos failed to stimulate osteoclastogenesis in the mutant cells. Notably, the IVVY motif mutation abrogated OC gene expression compared with a vector control, suggesting that the IVVY motif might counteract OC inhibitors during osteoclastogenesis. Consistently, the IVVY motif mutant triggered up-regulation of recombinant recognition sequence-binding protein at the Jκ site (RBP-J) protein, a potent OC inhibitor. Mechanistically, C/EBPα or c-Fos overexpression in the mutant cells failed to control the up-regulated RBP-J expression, leading to suppression of OC genes. Accordingly, RBP-J silencing in the mutant cells rescued osteoclastogenesis with C/EBPα or c-Fos overexpression with C/EBPα exhibiting a stronger osteoclastogenic effect. Collectively, our findings indicate that C/EBPα is a stronger inducer of OC differentiation than c-Fos, partly via C/EBPα regulation by the RANK 535IVVY538 motif."
https://openalex.org/W2767883430,"HIV-infected migrants were shown to have poorer treatment outcomes than Dutch HIV-infected patients, often due to worse treatment adherence. Self-reported adherence would be an easy way to monitor adherence, but its validity relative to pharmacy refill adherence has not been extensively evaluated in migrants. All HIV-infected migrants older than 18 years and in care at the two Rotterdam HIV-treatment centers were eligible. Refill data with leftover medication (PRL) (residual pill count) were obtained from their pharmacies up to 15 months prior to inclusion. Self-reported adherence to combination Antiretroviral Therapy was assessed by four questions about adherence at inclusion. Additionally, risk factors for pharmacy refill non-adherence were examined. In total, 299 HIV-infected migrants were included. Viral load (VL) was detectable in 11% of the patients. Specificity of PRL was 53% for patients with an adherence of 100% and decreased with lower cut-off values. Sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were 68% and 15% and increased with lower cut-off values. Positive predictive value (PPV) was around 93% for all cut-off values. Using the self-reported questions, 139 patients (47%) reported to be adherent. Sensitivity was 49% and specificity was 72%. PPV and NPV were 95% and 13%. No risk factors for pharmacy refill non-adherence were found in multivariable analyses. Both PRL and self-reported adherence, can predict undetectable VL in HIV-infected migrants. PPV and NPV are similar for both methods. This study shows that using four self-reported items is sufficient to predict adherence which is crucial for optimal clinical outcome in HIV-infected migrants."
https://openalex.org/W2767917988,"Postoperative deep infection after bone tumor surgery remains a serious complication. Although there are numerous reports about risk factors for postoperative deep infection in general surgery, there is only a small number of reports about those for bone tumor surgery. This retrospective study aimed to identify risk factors for postoperative deep infection after bone tumor resection.We reviewed data of 681 patients (844 bone tumors) who underwent surgery. Associations between variables, including age, recurrent tumor, pathological fracture, surgical site (pelvis/other), chemotherapy, biological reconstruction, augmentation of artificial bone or bone cement, the use of an implant, intraoperative blood loss, operative time, additional surgery for complications, and postoperative deep infection were evaluated.The rate of postoperative deep infection was 3.2% (27/844 tumors). A pelvic tumor (odds ratio [OR]: 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-11.3) and use of an implant (OR: 9.3, 95% CI: 1.9-45.5) were associated with an increased risk of deep infection.This retrospective study showed that pelvic tumor and use of an implant were independent risk factors for deep infection. This information will help surgeons prepare an adequate surgical plan for patients with bone tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2767684519,"Linkage studies have revealed a linkage of mild malaria to chromosome 6p21 that contains the NCR3 gene encoding a natural killer cell receptor, whereas NCR3-412G>C (rs2736191) located in its promoter region was found to be associated with malaria in Burkina Faso. Here we confirmed the association of rs2736191 with mild malaria in a Congolese cohort and investigated its potential cis-regulatory effect. Luciferase assay results indicated that rs2736191-G allele had a significantly increased promoter activity compared to rs2736191-C allele. Furthermore, EMSAs demonstrated an altered binding of two nuclear protein complexes to the rs2736191-C allele in comparison to rs2736191-G allele. Finally, after in silico identification of transcription factor candidates, pull-down western blot experiments confirmed that both STAT4 and RUNX3 bind the region encompassing rs2736191 with a higher affinity for the G allele. To our knowledge, this is the first report that explored the functional role of rs2736191. These results support the hypothesis that genetic variation within natural killer cell receptors alters malaria resistance in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2767804936,"Difficulty turning over in bed is a common night-time symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to quantitatively evaluate overnight turnover movements using a three-axis accelerometer and to investigate whether inability to turn in bed is related to daytime sleepiness, sleep quality, and depressive mood in PD patients.We examined 64 patients with PD (mean age, 73.3±8.21 years; modified Hoehn-Yahr [mH-Y] stage, 3.0±1.0; disease duration, 7.2±6.3 years; unified Parkinson's disease rating scale [UPDRS], 36.9±18.3). Overnight monitoring of turnover movements using a wearable three-axis accelerometer was performed in all patients. Nocturnal kinetic parameters including total time recumbent, total time supine, number of turnover movements, and mean interval between turnover movements were obtained. Daytime immobility was assessed using the Barthel index (B-I), UPDRS, and mH-Y stage. Patients were also assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).Number of turnover movements in bed correlated negatively with disease duration (r = -0.305; p<0.05), L-dopa-equivalent dose (r = -0.281; p<0.05), mH-Y staging (r = -0.336; p<0.01), total score of UPDRS (r = -0.386; p<0.01) and positively with B-I score (r = 0.365; p<0.01). Number of turnover movements in bed was generally inconsistent with awareness of turnover movement impairment as evaluated by PDSS-2 Item 9 scores, but patients who were never aware of impaired turnover movements showed ≥5 turnover movements overnight. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed no correlations between number of nocturnal turnover movements in bed and BDI, ESS, or PDSS-2. Use of anti-psychotic drugs was associated with ESS (p = 0.045). UPDRS was associated with PDSS-2 (p = 0.016).Decreased number of turnover movements may not be a direct determinant of daytime sleepiness, sleep disorders, or depressive mood in PD patients. Use of anti-psychotic drugs and higher UPDRS score are factors significantly associated with daytime sleepiness and uncomfortable sleep, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2767638988,"Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) is a Gram-negative nasopharyngeal commensal that can cause septicaemia and meningitis. The neisserial DNA damage-inducible protein DinG is a helicase related to the mammalian helicases XPD and FANCJ. These helicases belong to superfamily 2, are ATP dependent and exert 5′ → 3′ directionality. To better understand the role of DinG in neisserial genome maintenance, the Nm DinG (DinGNm) enzymatic activities were assessed in vitro and phenotypical characterization of a dinG null mutant (NmΔdinG) was performed. Like its homologues, DinGNm possesses 5′ → 3′ directionality and prefers DNA substrates containing a 5′-overhang. ATPase activity of DinGNm is strictly DNA-dependent and DNA unwinding activity requires nucleoside triphosphate and divalent metal cations. DinGNm directly binds SSBNm with a Kd of 313 nM. Genotoxic stress analysis demonstrated that NmΔdinG was more sensitive to double-strand DNA breaks (DSB) induced by mitomycin C (MMC) than the Nm wildtype, defining the role of neisserial DinG in DSB repair. Notably, when NmΔdinG cells grown under MMC stress assessed by quantitative mass spectrometry, 134 proteins were shown to be differentially abundant (DA) compared to unstressed NmΔdinG cells. Among the DNA replication, repair and recombination proteins affected, polymerase III subunits and recombinational repair proteins RuvA, RuvB, RecB and RecD were significantly down regulated while TopA and SSB were upregulated under stress condition. Most of the other DA proteins detected are involved in metabolic functions. The present study shows that the helicase DinG is probably involved in regulating metabolic pathways as well as in genome maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2767951363,"Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is one of the severe forms of Plasmodium falciparum infection. The main antigen VAR2CSA is the target of vaccine development. However, the large size of VAR2CSA protein and its high degree of variability limit to the efficiency of the vaccination. Using quantitative mass spectrometry method, we detected and quantified proteotypic peptides from 5 predicted PAM associated proteins. Our results confirmed that PFI1785w is over-expressed in PAM samples. Then, we investigated PFI1785w variability among a set of parasite samples from various endemic areas. PFI1785w appear to be more conserved than VAR2CSA. PFB0115w, another PAM associated protein, seems also associated with the pathology. Further vaccination strategies could integrate other proteins in addition to the major VAR2CSA antigen to improve immune response to vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2767867505,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the deposition of excessive extracellular matrix and the destruction of lung parenchyma, resulting from an aberrant wound-healing response. Although IPF is often associated with an imbalance in protease activity, the mechanisms underlying the sustained repair mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we addressed the role of the recently identified, membrane-anchored serine protease human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT). In the present study, we show that both HAT expression and activity were up-regulated in human IPF specimens. Next, adenoviral overexpression of HAT before bleomycin challenge attenuated lung injury as well as extracellular matrix deposition in the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model. In vitro, HAT prevented specific fibrosis-associated responses in primary human pulmonary fibroblasts and induced the expression of mediators associated with the prostaglandin E2 pathway. Altogether, our findings suggested that HAT could have a protective role in IPF and other fibrotic lung disorders.—Menou, A., Flajolet, P., Duitmen, J., Justet, A., Moog, S., Jaillet, M., Tabèze, L., Solhonne, B., Garnier, M., Mal, H., Mordant, P., Castier, Y., Cazes, A., Sallenave, J.-M., Mailleux, A.

https://openalex.org/W2767789868,"Vernalization is classically defined as the induction of flowering process by exposure of the plants to a prolonged cold condition. Normally, it is considered as a precondition of flowering. Vicia faba, commonly known as faba bean, belongs to family Fabaceae. It is one of the plant species that has been cultivated in the earliest human settlements. In this study, an iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS-based quantitative proteomic analysis has been conducted to compare the vernalized faba bean seedlings and its corresponding control. In total, 91 proteins from various functional categories were observed to be differentially accumulated in vernalized faba bean seedlings. Subsequent gene ontology analysis indicated that several biological processes or metabolic pathways including photosynthesis and phytic acid metabolism were differentially respond to vernalization in comparison to the control sample. Further investigation revealed that a family of proteins nominated as glycine-rich RNA-binding factor was accumulated in vernalized seedlings, indicating an extra layer of regulation by alternative splicing on transcript abundance in response to vernalization. These findings raise a possibility that these candidate proteins could be important to represent the responsive network under vernalization process. Therefore, we propose that the regulation of vernalization in faba bean not only occurs at the transcriptional level as previously reported, but also at the post-transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2768026790,This note looks into the reasons why earlier reports may have arrived at differing conclusions about pigeons’ capacity to categorize bilaterally symmetric and asymmetric visual patterns. Attention is drawn to pigeons’ comparatively superior visual flicker resolution and superior visual linear acuity by reporting results of two ad-hoc experiments. This circumstance turns out to constrain conclusions drawn by earlier symmetry–asymmetry studies that used computer-generated patterns displayed on cathode ray tube monitors as these suffered from pictorial distortions. Additionally one of the studies involved patterns of inconsistent symmetry at global and local levels. A smaller-scale experiment using slide-projected unequivocal symmetric and asymmetric patterns yielded results compatible with the supposition that pigeons are capable of a symmetry–asymmetry categorization. The possibility that an artfactual cue may have inadvertently accentuated this capability in an earlier own experiment is considered.
https://openalex.org/W2768077307,"Metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndromes (MetS) have been recognized as the important risk factors for asymptomatic intracranial vertebrobasilar stenosis (IVBS). Although fatty liver index (FLI) is significantly related with these diseases, the association between FLI and IVBS remains unclear. In the present study, 2368 participants (30-75 years) were recruited from a Chinese prospective cohort study of PMMJS. Amongst them, 2281 individuals who did not have IVBS at baseline were enrolled in the 6-year following-up study. In cross-sectional analysis based on the baseline characteristics, the results showed that FLI was positively related with IVBS prevalence. Compared to the participants with FLI < 30, the adjusted OR (95% CI) of IVBS was 2.07 (1.18, 3.62) and 2.85 (1.39, 5.18) in the groups of 30 ≤ FLI < 60 and FLI ≥ 60, respectively. In longitudinal analysis, the results showed that the participants with FLI ≥ 60 had an increased risk of asymptomatic IVBS compared to those with FLI < 30 [adjusted HR (95%CI): 1.65 (1.05, 2.60)]. Moreover, exclusion of persons with hypertension, T2DM and MetS did not alter the associations between FLI and asymptomatic IVBS. Therefore, our results suggest that elevated FLI is an independent risk factor for asymptomatic IVBS in Chinese adults."
https://openalex.org/W2767508417,"Rapidly increasing number of therapeutic antibodies are being repurposed to imaging probes for noninvasive diagnosis, as well as monitoring during treatment or disease recurrence. Though antibody-based imaging involves tracer doses (~3 log lower than therapeutic doses), and immune responses are severely reduced in patients with impaired immunity, formation of anti-tracer antibodies (ATA) has been observed hampering further diagnostic monitoring. Here, we explored the potential to develop humoral responses to intravenously administered tracer dose of a monoclonal antibody F(ab΄)2 fragment, and associated with host related immune measures in 49 rhesus macaques categorized into healthy (uninfected controls), SIV-progressors, SIV non-progressors, or total body irradiated (TBI). Antibody fragment administered in tracer amount (~100μg) induced immune responses with significantly lower odds in SIV-progressors or TBI macaques (P<0.005) as compared to healthy animals. Peripheral blood (PB) CD4+ cell counts, but not CD20+ cell levels, were associated with significantly higher risk of developing a humoral response (P<0.001). Doubling the PB CD4+ counts is associated with an odds ratio of developing an immune response of 1.73. Among SIV-infected animals, CD4+ cell count was a stronger predictor of immune response than plasma SIV-RNA levels. Both SIV-progressors and TBI macaques showed higher odds of responses with increasing CD4+ counts, however when compared to healthy or SIV non-progressors with similar CD4+ count, they were still functionally incompetent in generating a response (P<0.01). Moreover, presence of ATA in systemic circulation altered the in vivo biodistribution by increasing hepatic uptake and decreasing plasma radiotracer clearance, with minimal to no binding detected in targeted tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2768091907,"Reciprocal translocations are the most frequently occurring constitutional structural rearrangements in mammalian genomes. In phenotypically normal pigs, an incidence of 1/200 is estimated for such rearrangements. Even if constitutional translocations do not necessarily induce defects and diseases, they are responsible for significant economic losses in domestic animals due to reproduction failures. Over the last 30 years, advances in molecular and cytogenetic technologies have led to major improvements in the resolution of the characterization of translocation events. Characterization of translocation breakpoints helps to decipher the mechanisms that lead to such rearrangements and the functions of the genes that are involved in the translocation. Here, we describe the fine characterization of a reciprocal translocation t(3;4) (p1.3;q1.5) detected in a pig line. The breakpoint was identified at the base-pair level using a positional cloning and chromosome walking strategy in somatic cell hybrids that were generated from an animal that carries this translocation. We show that this translocation occurs within the ADAMTSL4 gene and results in a loss of expression in homozygous carriers. In addition, by taking this translocation as a model, we used a whole-genome next-generation mate-pair sequencing approach on pooled individuals to evaluate this strategy for high-throughput screening of structural rearrangements."
