https://openalex.org/W2148067809,"The incidence of autoimmune diabetes in NOD (non-obese diabetic) mice, a lab model for type 1 diabetes, varies depending on the conditions in which they are kept. In particular, NOD mice exposed to killed mycobacteria and other microbial products are protected against the development of diabetes, suggesting the involvement of the rapid innate immune response. Experiments in NOD mice deficient in innate immunity — through the absence of the Toll-like receptor signal adaptor protein MyD88 — now show that both innate immunity and intestinal microbiota influence predisposition to diabetes. Germ-free MyD88-negative mice developed robust diabetes, yet in mice with a complement of gut microbes similar to the normal human gut, diabetes was reduced. This raises the prospect that live 'friendly' microbes, or microbial products might be therapeutic options for type 1 diabetes. The effect of deficiency of MyD88 on the generation of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been investigated through the generation of congenic strains in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. It is found that in specific pathogen-free conditions, MyD88-deficiency attenuates T1D, indicating that the interaction of intestinal microbes with the innate immune system is a critical factor in modifying susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a debilitating autoimmune disease that results from T-cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β-cells. Its incidence has increased during the past several decades in developed countries1,2, suggesting that changes in the environment (including the human microbial environment) may influence disease pathogenesis. The incidence of spontaneous T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice can be affected by the microbial environment in the animal housing facility3 or by exposure to microbial stimuli, such as injection with mycobacteria or various microbial products4,5. Here we show that specific pathogen-free NOD mice lacking MyD88 protein (an adaptor for multiple innate immune receptors that recognize microbial stimuli) do not develop T1D. The effect is dependent on commensal microbes because germ-free MyD88-negative NOD mice develop robust diabetes, whereas colonization of these germ-free MyD88-negative NOD mice with a defined microbial consortium (representing bacterial phyla normally present in human gut) attenuates T1D. We also find that MyD88 deficiency changes the composition of the distal gut microbiota, and that exposure to the microbiota of specific pathogen-free MyD88-negative NOD donors attenuates T1D in germ-free NOD recipients. Together, these findings indicate that interaction of the intestinal microbes with the innate immune system is a critical epigenetic factor modifying T1D predisposition."

https://openalex.org/W1993026474,"DNA ends exposed after introduction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) undergo 5'-3' nucleolytic degradation to generate single-stranded DNA, the substrate for binding by the Rad51 protein to initiate homologous recombination. This process is poorly understood in eukaryotes, but several factors have been implicated, including the Mre11 complex (Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2/NBS1), Sae2/CtIP/Ctp1 and Exo1. Here we demonstrate that yeast Exo1 nuclease and Sgs1 helicase function in alternative pathways for DSB processing. Novel, partially resected intermediates accumulate in a double mutant lacking Exo1 and Sgs1, which are poor substrates for homologous recombination. The early processing step that generates partly resected intermediates is dependent on Sae2. When Sae2 is absent, in addition to Exo1 and Sgs1, unprocessed DSBs accumulate and homology-dependent repair fails. These results suggest a two-step mechanism for DSB processing during homologous recombination. First, the Mre11 complex and Sae2 remove a small oligonucleotide(s) from the DNA ends to form an early intermediate. Second, Exo1 and/or Sgs1 rapidly process this intermediate to generate extensive tracts of single-stranded DNA that serve as substrate for Rad51."
https://openalex.org/W1968257316,"Cyclophilin D (CypD, encoded by Ppif) is an integral part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, whose opening leads to cell death. Here we show that interaction of CypD with mitochondrial amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) potentiates mitochondrial, neuronal and synaptic stress. The CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Abeta- and Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling and permeability transition. Additionally, they have an increased calcium buffering capacity and generate fewer mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the absence of CypD protects neurons from Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Notably, CypD deficiency substantially improves learning and memory and synaptic function in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and alleviates Abeta-mediated reduction of long-term potentiation. Thus, the CypD-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore is directly linked to the cellular and synaptic perturbations observed in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Blockade of CypD may be a therapeutic strategy in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2031495223,"Adult muscle satellite cells have a principal role in postnatal skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. Satellite cells reside as quiescent cells underneath the basal lamina that surrounds muscle fibres and respond to damage by giving rise to transient amplifying cells (progenitors) and myoblasts that fuse with myofibres. Recent experiments showed that, in contrast to cultured myoblasts, satellite cells freshly isolated or satellite cells derived from the transplantation of one intact myofibre contribute robustly to muscle repair. However, because satellite cells are known to be heterogeneous, clonal analysis is required to demonstrate stem cell function. Here we show that when a single luciferase-expressing muscle stem cell is transplanted into the muscle of mice it is capable of extensive proliferation, contributes to muscle fibres, and Pax7(+)luciferase(+) mononucleated cells can be readily re-isolated, providing evidence of muscle stem cell self-renewal. In addition, we show using in vivo bioluminescence imaging that the dynamics of muscle stem cell behaviour during muscle repair can be followed in a manner not possible using traditional retrospective histological analyses. By imaging luciferase activity, real-time quantitative and kinetic analyses show that donor-derived muscle stem cells proliferate and engraft rapidly after injection until homeostasis is reached. On injury, donor-derived mononucleated cells generate massive waves of cell proliferation. Together, these results show that the progeny of a single luciferase-expressing muscle stem cell can both self-renew and differentiate after transplantation in mice, providing new evidence at the clonal level that self-renewal is an autonomous property of a single adult muscle stem cell."
https://openalex.org/W1977090021,"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a critical component of the polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is involved in gene silencing and histone H3 lysine 27 methylation. EZH2 has a master regulatory function in controlling such processes as stem cell differentiation, cell proliferation, early embryogenesis and X chromosome inactivation. Although benign epithelial cells express very low levels of EZH2, increased levels of EZH2 have been observed in aggressive solid tumors such as those of the prostate, breast and bladder. The mechanism by which EZH2 mediates tumor aggressiveness is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that EZH2 mediates transcriptional silencing of the tumor suppressor gene E-cadherin by trimethylation of H3 lysine 27. Histone deacetylase inhibitors can prevent EZH2-mediated repression of E-cadherin and attenuate cell invasion, suggesting a possible mechanism that may be useful for the development of therapeutic treatments. Taken together, these observations provide a novel mechanism of E-cadherin regulation and establish a functional link between dysregulation of EZH2 and repression of E-cadherin during cancer progression."

https://openalex.org/W2099917925,"Although increased levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) have been associated with cardiac disease, whether this enzyme has a causal role in the development of atherosclerosis has not been clear. Wilensky et al. now show in a pig model of atherosclerosis that a selective Lp-PLA2 inhibitor reduces progression to complex atherosclerotic lesion formation, an effect that is associated with decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lesions. These results support the use of Lp-PLA2 inhibitors for the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Increased lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity is associated with increased risk of cardiac events, but it is not known whether Lp-PLA2 is a causative agent. Here we show that selective inhibition of Lp-PLA2 with darapladib reduced development of advanced coronary atherosclerosis in diabetic and hypercholesterolemic swine. Darapladib markedly inhibited plasma and lesion Lp-PLA2 activity and reduced lesion lysophosphatidylcholine content. Analysis of coronary gene expression showed that darapladib exerted a general anti-inflammatory action, substantially reducing the expression of 24 genes associated with macrophage and T lymphocyte functioning. Darapladib treatment resulted in a considerable decrease in plaque area and, notably, a markedly reduced necrotic core area and reduced medial destruction, resulting in fewer lesions with an unstable phenotype. These data show that selective inhibition of Lp-PLA2 inhibits progression to advanced coronary atherosclerotic lesions and confirms a crucial role of vascular inflammation independent from hypercholesterolemia in the development of lesions implicated in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction and stroke."

https://openalex.org/W2097105997,"The hypothesis of cerebellar learning proposes that complex spikes in Purkinje cells engage mechanisms of plasticity in the cerebellar cortex; in turn, changes in the cerebellum depress the simple-spike response of Purkinje cells to a given stimulus and cause the adaptive modification of a motor behavior. Many elements of this hypothesis have been supported by prior experiments, and correlations have been found [corrected] between complex spikes, simple-spike plasticity and behavior [corrected] during the learning process. We carried out a trial-by-trial analysis of Purkinje cell responses in awake-behaving monkeys and found evidence for a causal role for complex spikes in the induction of cerebellar plasticity during a simple motor learning task. We found that the presence of a complex spike on one learning trial was linked to a substantial depression of simple-spike responses on the subsequent trial, at a time when behavioral learning was expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1964632863,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase that participates in numerous signalling pathways involved in diverse physiological processes. Several of these pathways are implicated in disease pathogenesis, which has prompted efforts to develop GSK3-specific inhibitors for therapeutic applications. However, before now, there has been no strong rationale for targeting GSK3 in malignancies. Here we report pharmacological, physiological and genetic studies that demonstrate an oncogenic requirement for GSK3 in the maintenance of a specific subtype of poor prognosis human leukaemia, genetically defined by mutations of the MLL proto-oncogene. In contrast to its previously characterized roles in suppression of neoplasia-associated signalling pathways, GSK3 paradoxically supports MLL leukaemia cell proliferation and transformation by a mechanism that ultimately involves destabilization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). Inhibition of GSK3 in a preclinical murine model of MLL leukaemia provides promising evidence of efficacy and earmarks GSK3 as a candidate cancer drug target."

https://openalex.org/W2089797553,"The HIV-1 protein Vif, essential for in vivo viral replication, targets the human DNA-editing enzyme, APOBEC3G (A3G), which inhibits replication of retroviruses and hepatitis B virus. As Vif has no known cellular homologs, it is an attractive, yet unrealized, target for antiviral intervention. Although zinc chelation inhibits Vif and enhances viral sensitivity to A3G, this effect is unrelated to the interaction of Vif with A3G. We identify a small molecule, RN-18, that antagonizes Vif function and inhibits HIV-1 replication only in the presence of A3G. RN-18 increases cellular A3G levels in a Vif-dependent manner and increases A3G incorporation into virions without inhibiting general proteasome-mediated protein degradation. RN-18 enhances Vif degradation only in the presence of A3G, reduces viral infectivity by increasing A3G incorporation into virions and enhances cytidine deamination of the viral genome. These results demonstrate that the HIV-1 Vif-A3G axis is a valid target for developing small molecule-based new therapies for HIV infection or for enhancing innate immunity against viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1983606581,"Endometrioid adenocarcinoma is the most frequent form of endometrial cancer, usually developing in pre- and peri-menopausal women. beta-catenin abnormalities are common in endometrioid type endometrial carcinomas with squamous differentiation. To investigate the role of beta-catenin (Ctnnb1) in uterine development and tumorigenesis, mice were generated which expressed a dominant stabilized beta-catenin or had beta-catenin conditionally ablated in the uterus by crossing the PR(Cre) mouse with the Ctnnb1(f(ex3)/+) mouse or Ctnnb1(f/f) mouse, respectively. Both of the beta-catenin mutant mice have fertility defects and the ability of the uterus to undergo a hormonally induced decidual reaction was lost. Expression of the dominant stabilized beta-catenin, PR(cre/+)Ctnnb1(f(ex3)/+), resulted in endometrial glandular hyperplasia, whereas ablation of beta-catenin, PR(cre/+)Ctnnb1(f/f), induced squamous cell metaplasia in the murine uterus. Therefore, we have demonstrated that correct regulation of beta-catenin is important for uterine function as well as in the regulation of endometrial epithelial differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1979521719,"The von Hippel-Lindau protein pVHL suppresses renal tumorigenesis in part by promoting the degradation of hypoxia-inducible HIF-alpha transcription factors; additional mechanisms have been proposed. pVHL also stabilizes the plant homeodomain protein Jade-1, which is a candidate renal tumour suppressor that may correlate with renal cancer risk. Here we show that Jade-1 binds the oncoprotein beta-catenin in Wnt-responsive fashion. Moreover, Jade-1 destabilizes wild-type beta-catenin but not a cancer-causing form of beta-catenin. Whereas the well-established beta-catenin E3 ubiquitin ligase component beta-TrCP ubiquitylates only phosphorylated beta-catenin, Jade-1 ubiquitylates both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated beta-catenin and therefore regulates canonical Wnt signalling in both Wnt-off and Wnt-on phases. Thus, the different characteristics of beta-TrCP and Jade-1 may ensure optimal Wnt pathway regulation. Furthermore, pVHL downregulates beta-catenin in a Jade-1-dependent manner and inhibits Wnt signalling, supporting a role for Jade-1 and Wnt signalling in renal tumorigenesis. The pVHL tumour suppressor and the Wnt tumorigenesis pathway are therefore directly linked through Jade-1."

https://openalex.org/W2047902321,"Early hypotheses suggested that the digits of tetrapods (land vertebrates) were homologues of the fin radials of fish, but this idea fell out of favour based on developmental studies and also on the fin of Panderichthys, an extinct fish closely related to land vertebrates, which appeared to lack distal digit-like fin radials. Evidence that fish had homologues of digits early in their evolutionary history has mounted, but Panderichthys stood in the way of full acceptance. Now a new computerized tomography study of a classic Panderichthys specimen shows that the old interpretation was in error. It did indeed have digit-like radials: the way is open to the era of fish fingers. Early hypotheses suggested that the digits of tetrapods (land vertebrates) were homologues of fin radials, but this idea fell out of favour on the basis of developmental studies and also on the fin of Panderichthys, a fish closely related to land vertebrates, which appeared to lack distal digit-like fin radials. A new CT study of a classic specimen of Panderichthys shows that the old interpretation was in error. Panderichthys did indeed have digit-like radials: nothing stands in the way of the era of fish fingers. One of the identifying characteristics of tetrapods (limbed vertebrates) is the presence of fingers and toes. Whereas the proximal part of the tetrapod limb skeleton can easily be homologized with the paired fin skeletons of sarcopterygian (lobe-finned) fish, there has been much debate about the origin of digits. Early hypotheses1 interpreted digits as derivatives of fin radials, but during the 1990s the idea gained acceptance that digits are evolutionary novelties without direct equivalents in fish fin skeletons. This was partly based on developmental genetic data2, but also substantially on the pectoral fin skeleton of the elpistostegid (transitional fish/tetrapod) Panderichthys, which appeared to lack distal digit-like radials3. Here we present a CT scan study of an undisturbed pectoral fin of Panderichthys demonstrating that the plate-like ‘ulnare’ of previous reconstructions is an artefact and that distal radials are in fact present. This distal portion is more tetrapod-like than that found in Tiktaalik4 and, in combination with new data about fin development in basal actinopterygians5, sharks6 and lungfish7, makes a strong case for fingers not being a novelty of tetrapods but derived from pre-existing distal radials present in all sarcopterygian fish."
https://openalex.org/W2119529730,"Egg-laying behavior of the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite is regulated by G protein signaling pathways. Here we show that the egg laying-defective mutant egl-6(n592) carries an activating mutation in a G protein-coupled receptor that inhibits C. elegans egg-laying motor neurons in a G(o)-dependent manner. Ligands for EGL-6 are Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH(2) (FMRFamide)-related peptides encoded by the genes flp-10 and flp-17. flp-10 is expressed in both neurons and non-neuronal cells. The major source of flp-17 peptides is a pair of presumptive sensory neurons, the BAG neurons. Genetic analysis of the egl-6 pathway revealed that the EGL-6 neuropeptide signaling pathway functions redundantly with acetylcholine to inhibit egg-laying. The retention of embryos in the uterus of the C. elegans hermaphrodite is therefore under the control of a presumptive sensory system and is inhibited by the convergence of signals from neuropeptides and the small-molecule neurotransmitter acetylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W2028975474,"Mast cell activation involves cross-linking of IgE receptors followed by phosphorylation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk. This results in activation of the plasma membrane-bound enzyme phospholipase Cgamma1, which hydrolyzes the minor membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate. Inositol trisphosphate raises cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration by releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This Ca2+ release phase is accompanied by sustained Ca2+ influx through store-operated Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. Here, we find that engagement of IgE receptors activates Syk, and this leads to Ca2+ release from stores followed by Ca2+ influx. The Ca2+ influx phase then sustains Syk activity. The Ca2+ influx pathway activated by these receptors was identified as the CRAC channel, because pharmacological block of the channels with either a low concentration of Gd3+ or exposure to the novel CRAC channel blocker 3-fluoropyridine-4-carboxylic acid (2',5'-dimethoxybiphenyl-4-yl)amide or RNA interference knockdown of Orai1, which encodes the CRAC channel pore, all prevented the increase in Syk activity triggered by Ca2+ entry. CRAC channels and Syk are spatially close together, because increasing cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering with the fast Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis failed to prevent activation of Syk by Ca2+ entry. Our results reveal a positive feedback step in mast cell activation where receptor-triggered Syk activation and subsequent Ca2+ release opens CRAC channels, and the ensuing local Ca2+ entry then maintains Syk activity. Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels therefore provides a means whereby the Ca2+ and tyrosine kinase signaling pathways can interact with one another."

Using single cell force spectroscopy, the contribution of galectin-3 to the adhesion of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to different extracellular matrix proteins was investigated. When adhering to collagen-I or –IV, some cells rapidly entered an enhanced adhesion state, marked by a significant increase in the force required for cell detachment. Galectin-3-depleted cells had an increased probability of entering the enhanced adhesion state. Adhesion enhancement was specific to integrin α2β1, as it was not observed when cells adhered to extracellular matrix substrates by other integrins. The adhesion phenotype of galectin-3-depleted cells was mimicked in a galactoside-deficient MDCK cell line and could be complemented by the addition of recombinant galectin-3.

Cell-ECM interactions are mediated by numerous adhesion receptors, of which integrins are the most prominent. Following initial adhesion to the ECM, integrins cluster and proteins are recruited to the newly formed contact sites, forming focal complexes, focal adhesions, and fibrillar adhesions. The formation of cytoplasmic protein assemblies anchors the adhesion complexes to the actin cytoskeleton and activates intracellular signaling cascades that control cellular responses (1Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 2Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Curr. Opin.

Trans. 2004; 32: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Although this regulation is complex, two main types: protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions mediate specific adhesion. Galectins have been implicated in the latter category. Galectins are a family of lectins, characterized by a common carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and affinity for β-galactosides. They are widely distributed in vertebrates and invertebrates; including nematodes, insects, sponges, and fungi (4Elola M.T. Wolfenstein-Todel C. Troncoso M.F. Vasta G.R. Rabinovich G.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1679-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In mammals, galectins occur at high concentrations only in a few cell types. Galectins lack signal sequences and, thus, are synthesized in the cytoplasm. They are not only found in the cytoplasm, in the nucleus and along the cell cortex, but also extracellularly, as they can be secreted via a non-classical pathway (5Hughes R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Given their diverse distribution, it is not surprising that galectins have been implicated in a variety of biological processes; including development, differentiation, morphogenesis, tumor metastasis, apoptosis, and RNA splicing (6Hughes R.C. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which galectins influence these processes. The fourteen human galectins are classified into three categories: prototype, tandem repeat, and chimeric. Prototype galectins contain one CRD and exist either as monomers or non-covalent homodimers. Tandem repeat galectins consist of two distinct CRDs joined by a linker peptide. Galectin-3 is the only chimeric galectin (7Leffler H. Carlsson S. Hedlund M. Qian Y. Poirier F. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 is expressed in macrophages, activated T-cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and often in tumor cells. On the cell surface, galectin-3 associates with a large number of different glycoconjugates including integrins and ECM proteins (8Dumic J. Dabelic S. Flogel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 616-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 consists of a C-terminal CRD and an N-terminal collagen-like domain. Through intermolecular interactions via the collagen-like domain, galectin-3 self-associates into multimers (9Nieminen J. Kuno A. Hirabayashi J. Sato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1374-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, galectin-3 is able to cross-link cell surface glycoproteins, thereby activating cells or mediating cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion (10Ahmad N. Gabius H.J. Andre S. Kaltner H. Sabesan S. Roy R.

Nature. 2001; 409: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type studied and the experimental conditions used, galectin-3 has been shown to both promote and inhibit cell adhesion (12Hughes R.C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Because many of these studies reported the effects of high concentrations of exogenous, recombinant galectin-3, the physiological functions of this lectin remain unclear. In this study, we applied single cell force spectroscopy (SCFS) to determine the role of galectin-3 in early adhesion of MDCK cells to various ECM constituents. Reducing galectin-3 expression did not alter early adhesion to fibronectin or laminin-332. However, on collagen-I and -IV galectin-3 knockdown cells had an elevated probability of entering an enhanced adhesion state. This was dependent on integrin α2β1 and characterized by a significant increase in the force required for cell detachment. We deduced that galectin-3 influences α2β1-mediated adhesion to regulate cooperative receptor binding. Cell Culture—MDCK strain II cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin (growth medium; all Invitrogen). The retrovirus-mediated knockdown of galectin-3 and -9 has been described previously (13Friedrichs J. Torkko J.M. Helenius J. Teravainen T.P. Fullekrug J. Muller D.J. Simons K. Manninen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29375-29383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, target sequences corresponding to the canine galectin-3 (528–548) and galectin-9 (867–887) coding sequences were selected. Annealed oligonucleotides were cloned into an RVH-1-puro retroviral vector and recombinant knockdown viruses were generated. MDCK strain II cultures were infected and incubated for 8–12 h. Infection was repeated 1–2 times before trypsinizing and re-seeding cells in MEM containing puromycin (4 μg/ml; BD Biosciences). Knockdown cells were used for up to 2 weeks without a significant drop in knockdown efficiency (14Schuck S. Manninen A. Honsho M. Fullekrug J. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4912-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). MDCK cells infected with retroviruses lacking a target sequence were used as controls. Twelve hours prior to SCFS experiments, the medium was replaced with CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% fetal calf serum. For SCFS experiments, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended into serum-free CO2-independent medium (measurement medium). Cells recovered for 15 min at 37 °C under constant rotation. Antibodies AIIB2 (1:10 dilution of hybridoma supernatant; kind gift of K. Matlin, Department of Surgery, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL), GoH3 (5 μg/ml; BD Pharmingen) and IgG from rat serum (10 μg/ml; Invitrogen) as well as RGD peptides (100 μg/ml; Sigma), RGE peptides (100 μg/ml; Coring System Diagnostix GmbH), full-length galectin-3 (4 μg/ml), and galectin-3-CRD (4 μg/ml; corresponding to residues 114–250 of human galectin-3) were incubated together with cells on ice for 30 min prior to SCFS experiments. Epifluorescent Detection of Endogenous Galectin-3—For detection of extra- and intracellular galectin-3, MDCK cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips and adhered for 20 min. Cells were fixed for 20 min in ice-cold paraformaldehyde (4%/PBS). After a PBS wash, residual aldehyde was quenched for 20 min in PBS containing 200 mm glycine (Sigma). Depending on the type of experiment, cells were either permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min (detection of total galectin-3) or left untreated (detection of extracellular galectin-3). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the cells in 0.5% BSA/PBS (blocking solution) for 30 min. Rat monoclonal galectin-3 antibody (Mac-2, Cedarlane Laboratories LTD) was applied (1:1000 in blocking solution) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washing steps, a FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc.) was added (1:2000 in blocking solution) and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Images were acquired with a LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, ×60 PlanApo oil objective, NA 1.1). SCFS Instrumentation—An atomic force microscope (AFM; NanoWizard, JPK Instruments) mounted on an Axiovert 200M (Zeiss) was used to perform SCFS experiments. To extend the vertical movement range to 100 μm, the AFM was equipped with the CellHesion module (JPK Instruments) (15Puech P.H. Poole K. Knebel D. Muller D.J. Ultramicroscopy. 2006; 106: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A BioCell (JPK Instruments) allowed measurements to be conducted at 37 °C. Cantilevers used were 200-μm long V-shaped silicon nitride tipless cantilevers with nominal spring constants of 0.06 N/m (NP-0, Veeco). Spring constants were calibrated using routines based on the equipartition theorem (16Hutter J.L. Bechhoefer J. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1993; 64: 1868-1873Crossref Scopus (3321) Google Scholar). Surface Coating of AFM Cantilever and Coverslips—AFM cantilevers were soaked in 10% Hellmanex (Hellma GmbH) and residual air plasma cleaned for 1 min. Then, cantilevers were incubated at 4 °C in 2 mg/ml concanavalin A (ConA; from Canavalia ensiformis, Sigma) overnight. Glass coverslips (24 mm) were coated as follows. After sequential washes in 1 n HCl, water, and EtOH, coverslips were air-dried and then, incubated in 0.8 μg/ml rat laminin-332 (Chemicon) for 2 h at 37 °C, 50 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin (Roche) for 2 h at 25 °C or 20 μg/ml collagen-IV (Sigma) for 12 h at 4 °C. For collagen-I coating, mica discs (6.5 mm) were glued (OP-29, Dymax Europe GmbH) to glass coverslips (24 mm). Then, bovine dermal collagen (30 μg/ml, Cohesion) in coating buffer (200 mm KCl, 50 mm glycine, pH 9.2) was added to freshly cleaved mica and incubated overnight at room temperature (17Cisneros D.A. Hung C. Franz C.M. Muller D.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 154: 232-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Unbound protein was removed with PBS and fresh measurement medium. Cell Capture, Force Measurement, and Data Processing—For SCFS experiments, cell suspensions were pipetted into the BioCell containing a coated coverslip. The apex of a ConA-coated cantilever was lowered onto a cell until a force of 0.75 nN was applied to the cell. After a contact time of 5 s, the cantilever was moved 50 μm from the surface where the cantilever-bound cell recovered for >5 min. For force-distance curve measurements, the approach and retract rates were 5 μm/s and the contact force 0.75 nN. The pulling range was 50 μm. At a contact time of 20 s, 10–15 force-distance curves were recorded with >20 s resting periods between approach/retract cycles. Cells were allowed to recover for ∼5 min, before a new set of force-distance curves was recorded. At 90 s contact time, force-distance curves were recorded at 3-min intervals, never exceeding 5 force-distance curves per cell. Loss of adhesion strength with force-distance curve cycles could not be observed (data not shown). Detachment forces and force step sizes were extracted using in-house algorithms in Igor Pro 5.05A (Wavemetrics). InStat (GraphPad Software) was used for running the Student's t test. All error bars show S.D. unless stated otherwise. TIRF Experiments—To analyze the contact area of MDCK cells with collagen-IV supports, a combined AFM-total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy setup was used. The AFM-bearing light microscope was additionally outfitted with a Laser TIRF Slider (Zeiss) coupled over a multi-mode optical fiber (AMS Technologies) to a Sapphire 488–50cdrh laser (Coherent). Images were acquired with a Coolsnap cf camera (Roper Scientific) and a ×100/1.45 alpha Plan-FLUAR oil objective (Zeiss). A FITC filter set (Chroma Technology Corp.) was used. Cells were trypsinized, washed once with growth medium without fetal calf serum, pelleted, and incubated with 20 μg/ml of a cell-labeling reagent (PKH67, Sigma) for 4 min at 25 °C. Then, cells were extensively washed with growth medium before they were resuspended in measurement medium. Protein Expression and Purification—Full-length, human galectin-3 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells, using the pET15b expression vector (kind gift of K. Simons, MPI-CBG, Dresden). Galectin-3 was purified from bacterial cell lysates using unmodified Sepharose (Sigma). In detail, after transforming electro-competent BL21 cells with the expression vector, a positive clone was grown at 37 °C until A600 had reached 0.8. The culture was diluted with ice-cold LB medium and expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Carl Roth) to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Then, the cultures were incubated at 18 °C for 12–16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (20 min, 2000 × g), resuspended in 1:20 volume of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (Roche, Complete Mini)), and lysed by sonication (100 watts) at 4 °C over six 10-s pulses separated by 30-s intervals. The lysate was clarified at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein was purified from the lysate by affinity chromatography in a column containing 7 ml of Sepharose (Sigma) and washed with several column volumes of Buffer A. Elution was performed using Buffer B (Buffer A + 200 mm lactose), collecting fractions of 1 ml volume. Based on SDS-Page profiles, the peak fractions (usually 2–4 fractions) were pooled. The pools were concentrated by passage through a Centricon™ microconcentrator (Millipore), followed by extensive dialysis against PBS. Although mammalian galectin-3 has a weak affinity for Sepharose, sufficient amounts of protein were purified. Purified proteins were stored at 4 °C and used for up to 1 week. Galectin-3-CRD was prepared as described by Massa et al. (18Massa S.M. Cooper D.N. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified galectin-3 was digested with collagenases VII (Sigma) with a lectin:collagenase ratio of 20:1 by weight in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 4 h. Adding EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm stopped the digestion. Then, galectin-3-CRD was purified by asialofetuin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The use of asialofetuin-Sepharose, instead of unmodified Sepharose, significantly improved the protein yield. Collagenase cleavage was verified by an observed shift in the mobility of galectin-3 in a SDS-PAGE gel. In a preceding study we applied SCFS to quantify early adhesion of MDCK cells to laminin-111 and collagen-I matrices (13Friedrichs J. Torkko J.M. Helenius J. Teravainen T.P. Fullekrug J. Muller D.J. Simons K. Manninen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29375-29383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that initial adhesion to laminin-111 is integrin-independent, and mediated by carbohydrate interactions. Galactose-binding galectins-3 and -9 facilitate these interactions. In contrast, adhesion to collagen-I was dependent on integrins and the depletion of neither galectin-3 nor -9 had an effect on the early adhesion (20 s contact time). Prolonged Contact of MDCK Cells to Collagen Substrates, Results in Highly Variable Detachment Forces—Here, we examined the adhesion of control, galectin-3 knockdown (Gal3-KD), and galectin-9 knockdown (Gal9-KD) MDCK cells to collagen-I matrices at contact times of 90 s. The measured detachment forces were highly variable (Fig. 1A) and showed cell-to-cell variations. The forces were not normally distributed, but tailed toward high values (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the tailing was especially evident in Gal3-KD cells. We previously reported a similar phenomenon for the adhesion of chinese hamster ovary cells to collagen-I matrices (19Taubenberger A. Cisneros D.A. Friedrichs J. Puech P.H. Muller D.J. Franz C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1634-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Upon prolonged contact times a fraction of cells entered an enhanced adhesion state. Along with significantly higher detachment forces, a rise in the smallest rupture forces (see Fig. 2B) to values above those required to break single integrin-collagen bonds (47 ± 13 pN at a loading rate of ∼500 pN/s) characterized this enhanced adhesion state (19Taubenberger A. Cisneros D.A. Friedrichs J. Puech P.H. Muller D.J. Franz C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1634-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Adhesion-enhancement was attributed to cooperative integrin receptors. TIRF Analysis of the Cell-Substrate Contact Area—The similar distribution of detachment forces on collagen-I supports (Fig. 1A) indicated that the processes leading to adhesion enhancement also occurred in MDCK cells. Inspired by these findings, we characterized adhesive properties of control, Gal3-KD, and Gal9-KD MDCK cells to collagen-I matrices at extended contact times. Differences in the spreading of cells on the substrate that lead to differences in the contact area could result in deviation in forces needed to detach cells. To determine if adhesion-enhanced cells spread quicker on the substrate, SCFS was combined with TIRF microscopy. Gal3-KD cells were labeled using a fluorescent membrane-intercalating dye. The adhesion to collagen was probed while imaging the contact area. Time-lapse TIRF images were quantified to measure the size of the contact areas (Fig. 1B). The resulting diagrams (Fig. 1C) demonstrated that, although the size of the contact area generally fluctuated more for adhesion-enhanced cells, the enhanced adhesion state was not associated with an increase in the contact area. SCFS Analysis of Adhesion to Collagen-I—Fig. 2A represents the stacked histogram of average detachment forces calculated for individual control, Gal3-KD and Gal9-KD cells. Detachment forces of the three cell lines were combined to increase the number of data points. A cell population distributed around the most probable value (MPV) of 1.3 nN, can be differentiated from a more varied population with a significantly higher MPV of 20 nN (Fig. 2A). Based on the detachment force histogram, a cut-off force of 4 nN was chosen to classify adhesion-enhanced and non-enhanced cells. Representative force-distance curves are depicted in Fig. 2B. Classifying cells according to this criterion allowed the comparison of the detachment forces between the three cell types. The average detachment forces of control and knockdown cells within the two classes revealed no significant difference (Fig. 2C). However, compared with control and Gal9-KD cells, Gal3-KD cells entered the enhanced adhesion state with increased probability (Fig. 2D). This result is in agreement with the distribution of detachment forces (Fig. 1A), where the majority of high detachment forces measured stemmed from Gal3-KD cells. To analyze by which integrin MDCK cells bind collagen-I, an integrin β1-function-blocking antibody (AIIB2) (20Zuk A. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1875-1889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and RGD peptides (21Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1986; 231: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) (competitive inhibitor for RGD-dependent integrins) were used (Fig. 2E). Antibody addition significantly reduced cell adhesion to collagen-I, whereas RGD peptides had no effect, demonstrating that adhesion of MDCK cells to collagen-I is mediated by a β1-subunit containing integrin. An isotype-matched rat IgG control antibody did not influence detachment forces, excluding nonspecific effects of AIIB2. Analyzing the smallest detectable unbinding force units (hereon called force steps; see also Fig. 2B, inset) extracted from force-distance curves, a difference was observed (Fig. 2F; force steps from Gal3-KD cells). Force step sizes from non-enhanced cells were distributed around 94 pN, coinciding with reported interaction forces of individual integrins with their ligands (22Weisel J.W. Shuman H. Litvinov R.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, most of the rupture events from these cells were attributed to the rupture of single integrin-collagen bonds. Similarly, the distribution of force step sizes from adhesion-enhanced cells was centered around an ill-defined peak at 110 pN. However, a broad tail at higher force values marked the distribution, showing that a considerable percentage of rupture events rose above the single molecule force level. This suggests that adhesive units containing cooperating integrin receptors had formed. Integrin Clustering, not Integrin Affinity Modulation Causes Adhesion Enhancement—In a separate experiment control cells were incubated with an antibody, TS2/16, known to increase the affinity of the integrin β1-subunit for their ligands (23van de Wiel-van Kemenade E. van Kooyk Y. de Boer A.J. Huijbens R.J. Weder P. van de Kasteele W. Melief C.J. Figdor C.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Compared with untreated cells, treated cells exhibited significantly higher detachment forces. The percentage of cells that classified as adhesion enhanced (>4 nN detachment force) almost doubled (data not shown). The force step MPV for untreated cells was 93 pN, whereas antibody addition increased the value to 133 pN (Fig. 2G). Both data sets were centered around the MPV but no pronounced tail toward high forces was observed. This shows that there are two distinct mechanisms to increase adhesion; increased integrin affinity, as observed for TS2/16 addition, and increased integrin cooperativity, as postulated in the previous paragraph. Both mechanisms can be distinguished by the size distribution of force steps. SCFS Analysis of Adhesion to Collagen-IV—To test if the increased probability of Gal3-KD cells to enter the enhanced adhesion state is specific to collagen-I, adhesion to collagen-IV was examined. Similar to collagen-I, collagen-IV is recognized by β1-subunit containing integrins, evidenced by the significant reduction of MDCK cell adhesion upon AIIB2 addition (Fig. 3A) (24White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). When probing adhesion of control, Gal3-KD and Gal9-KD cells to collagen-IV, measured detachment forces where highly variable (data not shown). Compared with control and Gal9-KD cells, the probability of adhesion enhancement was again higher for Gal3-KD cells (Fig. 3B). It is concluded that MDCK adhesion to collagen-I and -IV is similar. MDCK Cells Do Not Switch to the Enhanced Adhesion State When Adhesion Is Probed to Laminin-332—MDCK cells express at least four integrins, α2β1, α3β1, α6β4, and αVβ3 (25Schoenenberger C.A. Zuk A. Zinkl G.M. Kendall D. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 527-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion to collagen-I and -IV was likely mediated by integrin α2β1, as it is the only collagen-binding integrin identified in MDCK cells (26Jokinen J. Dadu E. Nykvist P. Kapyla J. White D.J. Ivaska J. Vehvilainen P. Reunanen H. Larjava H. Hakkinen L. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31956-31963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It remained to be determined whether galectin-3 only interfered with integrin α2β1-dependent adhesion, or also influenced adhesion by the other β1-containing integrin, α3β1. Integrin α3β1 has been identified as a receptor for laminins (27Nishiuchi R. Murayama O. Fujiwara H. Gu J. Kawakami T. Aimoto S. Wada Y. Sekiguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and thrombospondin (28Humphries J.D. Byron A. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3901-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Problematic in the analysis of integrin α3β1-mediated cell adhesion is the lack of ECM proteins, exclusively binding this receptor. For this reason, laminin-332 a ligand to which both, integrin α3β1 and α6β4, are known to bind was used (29Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 30Mak G.Z. Kavanaugh G.M. Buschmann M.M. Stickley S.M. Koch M. Goss K.H. Waechter H. Zuk A. Matlin K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3664-3677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To separate the contributions of the two integrins to cell adhesion, integrin-blocking antibodies AIIB2 (β1-subunit) and GoH3 (α6-subunit) (31Aumailley M. Timpl R. Sonnenberg A. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) were used. Between the three cell types no significant differences in the average detachment force could be detected (Fig. 4A). In accordance with literature, addition of the antibodies AIIB2 or GoH3 reduced, but did not completely blocked adhesion of MDCK cells to laminin-332 (Fig. 4A) (30Mak G.Z. Kavanaugh G.M. Buschmann M.M. Stickley S.M. Koch M. Goss K.H. Waechter H. Zuk A. Matlin K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3664-3677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Separating force-distance curves into adhesion-enhanced and non-enhanced classes was not possible for the reason illustrated in Fig. 4B. Adhesion to laminin-332 is stronger, with a MPV of 4600 pN, than to collagen-I (960 pN). As the MPV for the adhesion to laminin-332 is higher than the 4 nN cut-off force, used to separate adhesion-enhanced and non-enhanced cells, this criterion could not be applied. Unlike for adhesion to collagen, a high-force tail was not detectable in the force histogram recorded for laminin-332 (Fig. 4B), suggesting the lack of adhesion enhancement. Another characteristic of the enhanced adhesion state was the increased magnitude of force steps (19Taubenberger A. Cisneros D.A. Friedrichs J. Puech P.H. Muller D.J. Franz C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1634-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Force steps extracted from force-distance curves recorded on laminin-332 and collagen-I were compared (Fig. 4C). Whereas the force step histogram for collagen-I adhesion contains the described high-force tail, the distribution for laminin-332 adhesion lacked this feature. We concluded that adhesion enhancement does not occur when cells were in contact with laminin-332 although a β1-subunit-containing integrin was evidently involved. SCFS Analysis of Adhesion to Fibronectin—To analyze if integrin αvβ3 can induce the adhesion-enhanced phenotype in Gal3-KD cells, fibronectin was used as substrate. Fibronectin, a high molecular weight glycoprotein interacts with several integrins, of which at least the RGD-binding integrin αVβ3 (28Humphries J.D. Byron A. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3901-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) is expressed in MDCK cells (25Sc"

In this study, the effect of asymmetry in the lipid affinity of amphipathic helices in a bihelical apoA-I mimetic peptide, 37pA, on lipid efflux by the ABCA1 transporter was examined. Seven peptide variants of 37pA were produced by substituting a varying number of hydrophobic amino acids for alanine on either one or both helices. The 5A peptide with five alanine substitutions in the second helix had decreased helical content compared with 37pA (5A, 12 ± 1% helicity; 37pA, 28 ± 2% helicity) and showed less self-association but, similar to the parent peptide, was able to readily solubilize phospholipid vesicles. Furthermore, 5A, unlike the parent peptide 37pA, was not hemolytic (37pA, 27 ± 2% RBC lysis, 2 h, 18 μm). Finally, the 5A peptide stimulated cholesterol and phospholipid efflux by the ABCA1 transporter with higher specificity (ABCA1-transfected versus untransfected cells) than 37pA (5A, 9.7 ± 0.77%, 18 h, 18 μm versus 1.5 ± 0.27%, 18 h, 18 μm (p < 0.0001); 37pA, 7.4 ± 0.85%, 18 h, 18μm versus 5.8 ± 0.20%, 18 h, 18μm (p = 0.03)).

ApoA-I mimetic peptides, containing amphipathic helices, are currently being investigated as an alternative to apoA-I for acute HDL therapy of patients with acute coronary syndromes (21Nicholls S.J.

Remaley A.T. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2007; 8: 201-212PubMed Google Scholar). One of these peptides, 37pA, is a dimer of the original 18A (Ac-18A-NH2) peptide, sometimes referred to as 2F due to two phenylalanine residues at positions 6 and 18 (15Anantharamaiah G.M. Jones J.L.

We have previously shown that the 37pA peptide containing amphipathic helices with relatively high hydrophobic moment and high lipid affinity (15Anantharamaiah G.M. Jones J.L. Brouillette C.G.

A significant fraction of lipid efflux by 37pA was, however, nonspecific, since cholesterol and phospholipid efflux was also observed from untransfected HeLa cells not expressing the transporter. The 37pA peptide was also found to be partially cytotoxic (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L.

In contrast, lipid-free apoA-I is almost completely dependent on ABCA1 for lipid efflux and showed no evidence of cytotoxicity (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer H.B. J.

The relative unique ability of apoA-I to readily associate and dissociate with lipid, crucial for its role in HDL metabolism, has also been shown to be due to the presence of a mixture of low and high lipid affinity amphipathic helices (9Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23227-23232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24Pownall H.J. Ehnholm C.

Synthetic peptides based on apoA-I that contain one of the terminal high lipid affinity helices of apoA-I linked with one of the central helices, have been shown to stimulate lipid efflux by the ABCA1 transporter (17Natarajan P.

A cluster of negative charged amino acids on the polar surface of these peptides spanning the two helices was found to be necessary for these peptides to be active in cholesterol efflux, but no consistent relationship was found between the lipid affinity of these peptides (17Natarajan P.

The lipid affinity of the helices of these peptides was reduced by substituting amino acids on the hydrophobic face of the parent 37pA peptide with alanine. We found that peptides, with one high lipid affinity helix paired with a low lipid affinity helix, showed not only the greatest specificity for cholesterol and phospholipid efflux by the ABCA1 transporter but also the lowest cytoxicity. In contrast, cholesterol efflux by peptides containing two high lipid affinity helices was independent of the ABCA1 transporter and cytotoxic. Peptides containing two low lipid affinity helices were not cytotoxic but were inactive in cholesterol efflux. These results are relevant in understanding the mechanism for the interaction of native exchangeable apolipoproteins with the ABCA1 transporter and in the design of therapeutic amphipathic helical peptides for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (22Sethi A.A. Amar M. Shamburek R.D. Remaley A.T. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2007; 8: 201-212PubMed Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Synthesis and Calculations—All peptides were synthesized by a solid-phase procedure, using an Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/N,N′-diisopropylocarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole protocol on a Biosearch 9600 peptide synthesizer and were purified to greater than 99% purity by reverse-phase HPLC on an Aquapore RP-300 column, as assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Bruker UltraFlex). Retention time of peptides was determined after injection of 1 mg of purified peptide at 24 °C on a C-18 reverse-phase HPLC column and elution with a 25–85% gradient of acetonitrile, containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The hydrophobic moment of the peptides was calculated, using the combined consensus hydrophobicity scale (available on the World Wide Web). The mean hydrophobic moment was calculated as the vectorial sum of all the hydrophobicity indices, divided by the number of residues.Solubilization of Phospholipid Vesicles by Peptides—Multilamellar vesicles of DMPC were produced by sonication (5Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Datta G. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. Adeyeye S.O. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10313-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Peptides were incubated and continuously mixed at 24 °C with vesicles (1 mg/ml) in PBS, containing 8% NaBr, with the peptides at a final peptide concentration of ∼71 μm for 50 min, and absorbance was monitored at 430 nm every 5 s in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences plate reader with temperature control. Change in turbidity of samples, expressed as change in the initial rate constant (k) over time, was calculated for all peptides by a nonlinear curve fit for two-phase exponential decay and expressed as -fold change relative to H2O.The ability of the peptides to solubilize phospholipid vesicles produced from a mixture of lipids commonly found in cell membranes (bovine liver phosphatidylcholine (55%, w/v), porcine brain spingomyelin (12%), egg lysophosphatidylcholine (5%), bovine liver phosphatidylethanolamine (10%), porcine brain phosphatidylserine (8%), bovine liver phosphatidylinositol (10%)) was tested as previously described at 37 °C with a final peptide concentration of 71 μm (12Vedhachalam, C., Duong, P. T., Nickel, M., Nguyen, D., Dhanasekaran, P., Saito, H., Rothblat, G. H., Lund-Katz, S., and Phillips, M. C. (2007) J. Biol. Chem.Google Scholar).Fluorescence Assays—Tryptophan fluorescence from peptides (18 μm) in 20 mm NaHCO3, 0.15 m NaCl and from peptides complexed with DMPC (5A·DMPC; 1:15 molar ratio) was monitored in the presence and absence of guanidinium at 24 °C (26Vivian J.T. Callis P.R. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2093-2109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured in a Shimatzu RF150 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 291 nm and emission wavelength ranging from 300 to 400 nm. Peptides and DMPC were complexed by co-lyophilization after first being dissolved in glacial acetic acid. The resultant lyophilized cakes were reconstituted with 20 mm NaHCO3, 0.15 m NaCl and heated to 50 °C in a water bath for 3 min and then allowed to cool at room temperature for 3 min for a total of three cycles.Emission spectra of 5A and 37pA peptides before and after reconstitution with DMPC (1:15 molar ratio) were recorded following quenching with increasing acrylamide concentration (0–1 m) at 24 °C. The results are shown according to the Stern-Volmer equation (9Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23227-23232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).The fluorescence spectra (400–600 nm) of peptides (20 μm) dissolved in PBS in the presence of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) at 250 μm at 24 °C was also monitored at an excitation wavelength of 395 nm (9Saito H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 23227-23232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Circular Dichroism—Free peptides or peptides (100 μg/ml) associated with DMPC (1:15 molar ratio) were dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer and analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy at 24 °C. The far UV circular dichroism spectra were obtained on a Jasco 7-715 spectropolarimeter at room temperature between 250 and 185 nm. The instrument response time was 0.5 s, with a bandwidth of 1 nm and a scanning speed of 50 nm/min. Three separate dilutions of a single preparation of each peptide or complex were analyzed and subjected to four accumulations each. The raw data in millidegrees was converted to mean residual ellipticity, using a mean residual weight of 121.1 Helical estimates were determined from the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm (27Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). None of the tested solutions were turbid; therefore, no adjustment for light scattering was made.Size Analysis of Peptide Complexes—Analysis of the number of peptide monomers present per peptide complex was performed by mixing a 20-fold molar excess of the cross-linker dimethylsuberimidate (Pierce) to the peptides at 24 °C in PBS, followed by analysis on a 10–20% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (28Calabresi L. Vecchio G. Longhi R. Gianazza E. Palm G. Wadensten H. Hammarstrom A. Olsson A. Karlstrom A. Sejlitz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32168-32174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were also analyzed by gel filtration on a Superose G75 column. Low molecular weight gel filtration standards were used as calibrators (GE Healthcare).Red Cell Hemolysis Assay—Washed red blood cells were obtained from EDTA-anticoagulated blood and suspended in PBS at approximately a 4% hematocrit. Cell toxicity of peptides was tested by incubating red blood cells for 2 h at 37 °C with the indicated concentration of the peptides, followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min and measurement of the absorbance of the supernatant at 540 nm. Complete lysis was determined after the addition of 1% Triton X-100.Lipid Efflux Assay—HDL (d = 1.063–1.021 g/ml) was isolated from human serum by density gradient ultracentrifugation (29Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Cholesterol and phospholipid efflux was performed as described previously (30Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), using a stably transfected HeLa cell line expressing the human ABCA1 transporter (18Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. Duverger N.J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). HeLa cells transfected with a hygromycin-resistant control plasmid were used as the control cell line. Cholesterol efflux was examined at 37 °C in cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol for 48 h, washed, and challenged with either apoA-I or the free peptides at the concentrations indicated for 18 h. Percentage efflux was calculated by subtracting the radioactive counts in the blank medium (α-minimal essential medium with 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) from the radioactive counts in the presence of an acceptor and then dividing the result by the sum of the radioactive counts in the medium plus the cell fraction. Cholesterol efflux after 4 h at 37 °C to the indicated acceptors at 80 μg/ml was also examined in THP-1 cells before and after stimulation with 4 μm TO901317 and before and after a 10-min fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde (13Remaley A.T. Thomas F. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Bark S.E. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 828-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).For phospholipid efflux, cells were labeled with [methyl-3H]choline chloride for 24 h, washed, and challenged for 18 h with the indicated acceptors in α-minimal essential medium with 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. The percentage efflux was calculated in the same way as for cholesterol efflux, except that the radioactive counts in the medium were obtained following extraction with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2).Statistical Analyses—Phospholipid vesicle solubilization by peptides was examined as change in turbidity and expressed as -fold change in rate constant relative to H2O calculated by a nonlinear curve fit for two-phase exponential decay. Student's t test was used to compare means, and a two-sided p value <0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSThe peptides synthesized for this study and their physical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The peptides are all variants of the 37pA peptide, which is a bihelical peptide containing two 18A amphipathic helices with relatively high lipid affinity linked with a proline (15Anantharamaiah G.M. Jones J.L. Brouillette C.G. Schmidt C.F. Chung B.H. Hughes T.A. Bhown A.S. Segrest J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10248-10255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 37pA peptide was altered by reducing its lipid affinity by substituting hydrophobic amino acids on its hydrophobic face with alanine, which is only partially hydrophobic (4Phoenix D.A. Harris F. Daman O.A. Wallace J. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 201-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In peptides designated 1A–5A, 1–5 alanine substitutions were made in the second COOH-terminal helix. For the 5A-2 peptide, three alanine substitutions were made in the first NH2-terminal helix and two alanine substitutions in the second COOH-terminal helix to produce a peptide predicted to contain two moderate lipid affinity helices. For the 10A peptide, five alanine substitutions were made in both helices to produce a peptide predicted to contain two amphipathic helices with relatively low lipid affinity.TABLE 1Characteristics and sequences of peptidesFig. 1A shows that after each successive alanine substitution, the modified 37pA peptides when dissolved in acetonitrile had reduced lipid affinity, as assessed by their reduced retention time on a reverse-phase HPLC. A nearly linear relationship was observed between the calculated mean hydrophobic moment of the peptides and their retention time. The parent peptide, 37pA, and the 5A and 5A-2 peptides were also tested for their ability to bind ANS (Fig. 1B), a fluorescent lipophilic dye, which shows enhanced fluorescence when in a hydrophobic environment (31Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). In this experiment, the peptides were dissolved in an aqueous buffer, and the 37pA peptide showed much higher ability to bind and shield ANS compared with the 5A peptide. The emission spectra for the 5A-2 peptide overlapped the spectra for free ANS, indicating that the 5A-2 peptide was ineffective in binding ANS.FIGURE 1Peptide retention time and ANS fluorescence. A, retention time on reverse-phase HPLC is shown versus average hydrophobic moment for each peptide. Retention time was calculated by injecting 1 mg of purified peptide at 24 °C on a C-18 reverse-phase HPLC column and elution with a 25–85% gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The hydrophobic moment was calculated as the average of the mean hydrophobic moment for the two helices.

The 5A peptide was most effective in solubilizing DMPC vesicles, as determined by the rate constant for the solubilization (Table 1). Consistent with its shorter retention time on HPLC and reduced ANS binding, the 5A-2 peptide was less effective than 5A. As expected, the 10A peptide containing two relatively low lipid affinity helices was the least effective (Fig. 2A). Peptides 1A–4A with 1–4 alanine substitutions in the second helix were intermediate in their ability to solubilize DMPC vesicles compared with 37pA and the 5A peptide (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when examining the solubilization of phospholipid vesicles made with a mixture of natural lipids commonly found in cell membranes (Fig. 2B) (9Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23227-23232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this case, however, the 37pA peptide was the most effective, but the 5A peptide still showed considerable activity, whereas the 5A-2 peptide, as before, was ineffective (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Peptide solubilization of phospholipid vesicles.

These mice develop and breed normally and have no overt phenotype. In vitro studies using a range of substrates for different P450 enzymes showed that in hepatic microsomal cytochrome b5 null NADH-mediated metabolism was essentially abolished for most substrates, and the NADPH-dependent metabolism of many substrates was reduced by 50–90%. This reduction in metabolism was also reflected in the in vivo elimination profiles of several drugs, including midazolam, metoprolol, and tolbutamide. In the case of chlorzoxazone, elimination was essentially unchanged. For some drugs, the pharmacokinetics were also markedly altered; for example, when administered orally, the maximum plasma concentration for midazolam was increased by 2.5-fold, and the clearance decreased by 3.6-fold in hepatic microsomal cytochrome b5 null mice.

Chem. 2007; 282: 29766-29776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b5 has been shown to affect the in vitro activities of a wide range of human P450s, such as CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4, as well as the metabolism of an extensive number of commonly used drugs (9Aoyama T.

Although the mechanism(s) of the stimulatory effect of cytochrome b5 on P450 metabolism appear complex, it is widely accepted that the P450 catalytic cycle involves the sequential transfer of two electrons from NADPH via P450 oxidoreductase (POR). 2The abbreviations used are: POR, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase; AUC, area under the curve; BFC, 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; BR, benzyloxyresorufin; Cmax, maximum concentration of drug achieved in the blood after dosing; EFC, 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; ER, ethoxyresorufin; HBN, hepatic microsomal cytochrome b5 null; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MFC, 7-methoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 2The abbreviations used are: POR, cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase; AUC, area under the curve; BFC, 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; BR, benzyloxyresorufin; Cmax, maximum concentration of drug achieved in the blood after dosing; EFC, 7-ethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; ER, ethoxyresorufin; HBN, hepatic microsomal cytochrome b5 null; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MFC, 7-methoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Hildebrandt and Estabrook (5Hildebrandt A. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 143: 66-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) concluded that cytochrome b5/cytochrome b5 reductase was able to supply the second (rate-limiting) electron from NADH and possibly in a more rapid manner. However, recent data from Waskell et al. (8Zhang H. Im S.C. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29766-29776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) suggest that cytochrome b5 and POR are capable of reducing P450s at much the same rate, albeit that overall catalysis occurs more slowly with POR, leading to speculation that the oxyferrous form of P450 may exist in different conformations with POR or cytochrome b5 (11Zhang H. Gruenke L. Arscott D. Shen A. Kasper C. Harris D.L. Glavanovich M. Johnson R. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11594-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A noncatalytic (i.e. allosteric) role has also been proposed for the interaction of cytochrome b5 with cytochrome P450, based on reports that apocytochrome b5 (i.e. without the heme prosthetic group) can stimulate P450 catalysis (1Loughran P.A. Roman L.J. Miller R.T. Masters B.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Hlavica P. Lewis D.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4817-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Yamazaki H.

It does seem clear however, that cytochrome b5 binding can cause conformational changes to the substrate access channel and binding pocket in the P450 enzyme (1Loughran P.A. Roman L.J. Miller R.T. Masters B.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Yamazaki H. Gillam E.M. Dong M.S. Johnson W.W. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In many cases, allosteric stimulation increases P450 activity by a relatively small amount, and the physiological relevance of this effect, if any, is unclear (6Porter T.D. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All studies on cytochrome b5 to date have been carried out in vitro; the in vivo relevance of these findings has remained unknown (9Aoyama T. Nagata K. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. Matsunaga E. Gelboin H.V.

Although the prediction of in vivo drug pharmacokinetic data obtained from in vitro experiments rarely takes the potential contribution of cytochrome b5 into account, a recent study using recombinant human P450s did find that using cytochrome b5 yielded a more accurate estimate of intrinsic clearance (21Emoto C. Iwasaki K. Xenobiotica. 2007; 37: 986-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In order to establish the relevance of the in vitro observations to those in vivo and to evaluate whether variability in cytochrome b5 levels may affect rates of drug metabolism, we have conditionally deleted microsomal cytochrome b5 in the liver. Using hepatic microsomal cytochrome b5 null (HBN) mice, we demonstrate that the in vitro rate of NADPH- and NADH-dependent metabolism of a range of both model substrates and probe drugs is markedly changed. Furthermore, we show that when probe drugs are administered to mice, significant changes in drug pharmacokinetics occur. Chemicals—All reagents unless stated were purchased from Sigma. NADPH was obtained from Melford Laboratories (Ipswich, UK). Bufuralol, 1′-hydroxybufuralol, 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (BFC), 7-methoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (MFC), 7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin, and hydroxytolbutamide were purchased from BD Gentest (Cowley, UK). Midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam, and 4-hydroxymidazolam were kind gifts from Roche Applied Science, and 1-hydroxymetoprolol and O-demethylmetoprolol were generous gifts from Astra Häsle (Mölndal, Sweden). Generation of Hepatic Microsomal Cytochrome b5 Null Mice—A targeting vector was constructed from an 18-kb DNA fragment, produced by fusing overlapping PCR fragments generated from mouse 129/Ola genomic DNA (supplemental Fig. 1A), containing exons 2–5 of the mouse cytochrome b5 gene. A cassette, flanked by same orientation loxP sites and containing a selectable marker (neomycin), driven by the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, was cloned into a BclI site in intron 1, and a third loxP site was cloned into a KpnI site in intron 5. The construct was checked by PCR and sequencing and transfected into GK129/1 embryonic stem cells by electroporation; the embryonic stem cells were subsequently cultured in 96-well plates under G418 selection. G418-resistant clones were screened for specific homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis, using BglII and an 800-bp PCR fragment generated using 5′-GGCACAACACCAATTATTTGTC-3′ and 5′-GACAGTCCTTAACACAAGCTC-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Two correctly targeted embryonic stem cell clones (Cytb+/lox5) were expanded, injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and transferred into pseudopregnant mice. Male chimeric mice were bred to C57BL/6 mice, and heterozygous offspring were screened by Southern blot and multiplex PCR to confirm germ line transmission of the Cytb+/lox5 genotype (supplemental Fig. 1B) using the following primer set: 1) forward primer, 5′-CCAATGGTCTCTCCTTGGTC-3′;2) lox/neomycin reverse primer, 5′-CAATAGCAGCCAGTCCCTTC-3′; 3) wild-type reverse primer, 5′-GATGGAGTTCCCCGATGAT-3′. Mouse Breeding and Maintenance—Cytb5lox/+ mice were crossed to produce homozygous Cytb5lox/lox mice and maintained by random breeding on a 129P2 × C57BL/6 genetic background. Cytb5lox/lox mice were crossed with a transgenic mouse line expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the hepatocyte-specific rat albumin promoter (CreALB) (22Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) on a C57BL/6 background, and Cytb5lox/+::CreALB offspring were backcrossed with Cytb5lox/lox mice to generate liver-specific microsomal cytochrome b5 conditional knock-out mice (HBN; Cytb5lox/lox::CreALB) and control (wild-type, Cytb5lox/lox) mice. The HBN line was thereafter maintained by random intercrossing of these two lines. The presence of the CreALB transgene was determined as previously described (23Henderson C.J. Otto D.M. Carrie D. Magnuson M.A. McLaren A.W. Rosewell I. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13480-13486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). All mice were maintained under standard animal house conditions, with free access to food and water, and a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. All animal work was carried out on male 10-week-old mice in accordance with the Animal Scientific Procedures Act (1986) and after local ethical review. In Vivo Drug Treatments—HBN and wild-type mice were administered the following drugs either concomitantly as a mixture or individually: chlorzoxazone (5 mg/kg), metoprolol (2 mg/kg), midazolam (5 mg/kg), phenacetin (5 mg/kg), and tolbutamide (5 mg/kg), dissolved in mixture buffer (5% ethanol, 5% DMSO, 35% polyethylene glycol 200, 40% phosphate buffered saline, and 15% water), by intravenous injection or orally by gavage. Preparation of Microsomes—Microsomes were prepared from wild-type and HBN mouse tissues, using 0.3–0.5 g of tissue, by a modified method of Meehan et al. (24Meehan R.R. Forrester L.M. Stevenson K. Hastie N.D. Buchmann A. Kunz H.W. Wolf C.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), using sonication instead of mechanical homogenization (25Pritchard M.P. Glancey M.J. Blake J.A. Gilham D.E. Burchell B. Wolf C.R. Friedberg T. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Microsomal protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. POR activity was estimated by NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reduction (26Strobel H.W. Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Microsomes were stored at –70 °C until required. Immunoblotting—Western blot analysis was carried out as previously described using polyclonal antisera raised against human POR (27Smith G.C. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); rat cytochrome b5; rat CYP2A1, CYP2B1, CYP2C6, CYP3A1, and CYP4A1 (28Forrester L.M. Henderson C.J. Glancey M.J. Back D.J. Park B.K.

Biophys. 1997; 345: 342-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum to rat cytochrome b5 reductase and a monoclonal antibody raised against rat CYP1A1 were also used. 3C. R. Wolf, unpublished results. The polyclonal antiserum to cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase was a kind gift from Dr. Hao Zhu (Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas City, KS). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using polyclonal goat anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-sheep horseradish peroxidase immunoglobulins as secondary antibodies (Dako, Ely, UK) and visualized using Immobilon™ chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore, Watford, UK) and a FUJIFILM LAS-3000 mini-imaging system (Fujifilm UK Ltd.). Densitometric analysis was performed using Multi Gauge version 2.2 software (Fujifilm UK Ltd.). Generic Microsomal Incubations—Microsomal incubations were carried out in triplicate in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2 containing mouse liver microsomes and substrate prewarmed to 37 °C before initiation of the reaction by the addition of either NADPH or NADH to a final concentration of 0.5 or 1 mm, respectively. Fluorogenic Assay Incubations—Assays were performed in a final volume of 150 μl using white 96-well plates and the following substrate and microsome concentrations: BFC, 50 μm substrate, 20 μg of mouse liver microsomes; EFC, 40 μm substrate, 15 μg of mouse liver microsomes; MFC, 180 μm of substrate, 15 μg of mouse liver microsomes; ethoxyresorufin (ER) and benzoxyresorufin (BR), 1 μm substrate, 11.25 μg of mouse liver microsomes. Reactions were measured in real time for 3 min, using the recommended excitation and emission wavelengths for each probe using a Fluroskan Ascent FL plate reading fluorimeter (Labsystems, UK). Turnover rates were calculated using authentic metabolite standards (7-hydroxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin for BFC, EFC, and MFC assays and resorufin for ER and BR assays). NADH-mediated Incubations for HPLC or Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) Analysis—NADH-mediated reactions were performed in triplicate using the following conditions: bufuralol, 300 μm (final concentration), 20 μg of mouse liver microsomes in a final volume of 150 μl for 6 min; chlorzoxazone, 1 mm (final concentration) and 20 μg of mouse liver microsomes in a final volume of 150 μl for 15 min; midazolam, 50 μm (final concentration) and 25 μgof mouse liver microsomes in a final volume of 150 μl for 9 min; metoprolol, 800 μm (final concentration) and 30 μg of mouse liver microsomes in a final volume of 150 μl for 60 min; phenacetin, 200 μm (final concentration) and 20 μg of mouse liver microsomes in a final volume of 100 μl for 9 min; tolbutamide, 800 μm (final concentration) and 30 μg of mouse liver microsomes in a final volume of 150 μl for 60 min. Assays were stopped by the addition of either 0.5 assay volumes (for bufuralol, chlorzoxazone, and tolbutamide assays) or 1 assay volume (for midazolam and phenacetin assays) of ice-cold methanol and incubated on ice for 10 min. Kinetic Determinations—Assays to determine the apparent kinetic parameters were performed in triplicate with wild-type and HBN liver microsomes under conditions of linearity for time and protein (data not shown) using the same buffer/NADPH conditions as described above, with the following concentrations of substrates: chlorzoxazone, 10–1000 μm; phenacetin, 1.7–150 μm; midazolam, 0.9–75 μm; metoprolol, 10–1000 μm; tolbutamide, 10–1000 μm (12 concentration points/determination). Metabolites were detected by LC-MS/MS as described in the supplemental materials. The data generated were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Michaelis-Menten equation (chlorzoxazone, phenacetin, midazolam, and metoprolol), whereas the Hill equation (tolbutamide) (Equation 1) was used to determine the kinetic parameters Vmax,S50, and the Hill coefficient (n). V=Vmax×SnS50n+Sn(Eq. 1) In Vivo Pharmacokinetics—Whole blood (10 μl) was taken from the tail vein at intervals after drug administration and transferred into a tube containing heparin (10 μl, 15 IU/ml). Internal standard solution (10 μl; 500 ng of caffeine and 500 ng of resorpine) was added to each tube. Protein precipitation was carried out by adding methanol (75 μl), followed by 8% sulfosalicylic acid (55 μl). Samples were mixed for 1 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC. The range of concentrations for the standard curves was constructed for quantifying blood levels by spiking blank blood samples with known amounts of chlorzoxazone, metoprolol, midazolam, phenacetin, and tolbutamide. Extraction and protein precipitation were carried out as outlined above for the test samples. Analysis of in Vitro and in Vivo Data—Average rates of metabolism were calculated for each triplicate incubation of mouse liver microsomes from each genotype (n = 6), and these data were then used to calculate p values using an unpaired t test (available on the World Wide Web). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using WinNonLin software, version 3.1. A simple noncompartmental model was used to calculate area under the curve (AUC), terminal half-life, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and clearance. Details of assays and separation conditions for HPLC and LC-MS/MS are given in the supplemental materials. Hepatic Microsomal Cytochrome b5 Null Mice—Mice nulled for hepatic microsomal cytochrome b5 (Cytb5lox/lox::CreALB) were born at the expected Mendelian ratio, developed normally, and displayed no overt phenotype when compared with their wild-type littermates (Cytb5lox/lox). Livers from adult HBN mice looked similar to those of wild-type animals, with no gross changes in general morphology or pathology noted. To establish whether hepatic microsomal cytochrome b5 protein had been deleted specifically, microsomes from liver, lung, kidney, and small and large intestine were immunoblotted for cytochrome b5 expression (Fig. 1A). Cytochrome b5 protein was virtually undetectable in microsomes from the livers of HBN mice; however, occasionally, a very faint band was observed in some samples, possibly originating from liver cells other than hepatocytes. There were no discernible differences in cytochrome b5 expression between the HBN and wild-type mice in the other organs examined. No cytochrome b5 protein could be detected in microsomes from the large intestine of either genotype (data not shown). In order to investigate whether concomitant changes in P450 expression had occurred, three representative liver microsomal samples of each genotype were analyzed for P450 enzyme profiles, POR, and cytochrome b5 reductase levels (Fig. 1B). Although the expression of some P450s was slightly elevated in the HBN mice, these changes were not statistically significant. Cytochrome b5 reductase level was slightly increased when the immunoreactive bands were quantified by densitometry (Fig. 1C). A slight reduction in Cyp2d expression was also observed. As can be seen from supplemental Fig. 2A, there was no difference observed in the amount of spectrally active P450 in the HBN as compared with wild-type liver microsomes, with both samples containing ∼0.15 nmol of P450/mg of microsomal protein. POR protein levels were also essentially unchanged in HBN compared with wild-type mice, and although a slight increase in POR activity in HBN mice was measured using cytochrome c as substrate (228 ± 65 versus 180 ± 26 nmol cytochrome c reduced/min/mg), this change was not significant. In Vitro Cytochrome P450 Activities—Six commonly used P450 model substrates were used to establish if there were any in vitro differences in metabolism between liver microsomes from HBN and wild-type mice: BFC (CYP3A), MFC (CYP2C), EFC (CYP1A/2B), ER (CYP1A1/2, CYP1B1), BR (CYP2B/3A), and bufuralol (CYP2D) (30Burke M.D. Thompson S.

Assays were performed at substrate concentrations of ∼5 times Km (mouse), as defined by the literature, or data were generated with recombinant mouse P450s (data not shown). With NADPH as electron donor, significantly lower turnover rates were measured in HBN mice relative to wild-type samples for all substrates tested. The NADPH-mediated rates in HBN liver microsomes, expressed relative to wild-type samples, were as follows: ER (73%), bufuralol (44%), BR (34%), BFC (19%), MFC (11%), and EFC (10%) (Fig. 2, supplemental Table 3). The addition of recombinant cytochrome b5 to HBN microsomes led to a concentration-dependent increase in BFC or chlorzoxazone metabolism, restoring activities to wild-type levels, demonstrating that the change in metabolism was due to the absence of cytochrome b5. Cytochrome b5 alone had no activity toward BFC or chlorzoxazone (supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). NADH could support monooxygenase activity for all model substrates in the wild-type samples, although the activity relative to NADPH was highly substrate-dependent, ranging from 4% (BR) to 74% (ER) (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 3). All NADH-catalyzed reaction rates with the exception of BR were significantly lower in the HBN samples compared with wild type, with barely detectable activities using BFC (0.66%), EFC (0.79%), and MFC (0.28%) as substrates (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 3). The metabolism of ER and bufuralol was also reduced, to 52 and 28% of wild-type values, respectively. The NADH-mediated in vitro turnovers of the probe drugs chlorzoxazone (Cyp2e1), metoprolol (Cyp2d), midazolam (Cyp2c, Cyp3a), tolbutamide (Cyp2c), and phenacetin (Cyp1a) (37Court M.H. Von Moltke L.L.

NADH supported the metabolism of all substrates examined in wild-type liver microsomes, with the exception of tolbutamide. Rates observed were 601 ± 152 (chlorzoxazone 6′-hydroxylation), 128 ± 60 (metoprolol O-demethylation), 17.6 ± 0.2 (metoprolol α-hydroxylation), 17.1 ± 8.0 (midazolam 1′-hydroxylation), 9.1 ± 3.8 (midazolam 4-hydroxylation), and 244 ± 63 pmol/min/mg (phenacetin hydroxylation). These rates observed in wild-type liver microsomes were significantly lower than those observed using NADPH as co-factor, ranging from 7 to 29% (O-demethylmetoprolol and acetaminophen production, respectively) of the NADPH rate. Furthermore, the NADH-dependent turnover rates observed in HBN liver microsomes (177 ± 64 (chlorzoxazone 6′-hydroxylation), 90 ± 21 (metoprolol O-demethylation), 7.6 ± 2.2 (metoprolol α-hydroxylation), 4.3 ± 2.0 (midazolam 1′-hydroxylation), 2.1 ± 2.7 (midazolam 4-hydroxylation), and 67 ± 18 pmol/min/mg (phenacetin hydroxylation)) were significantly lower than the NADH-dependent wild-type rates (chlorzoxazone (29% reduction), metoprolol (O-demethyl 71%, α-hydroxy 44%, acid 83% reduction), midazolam (1′- and 4-hydroxy 25% reduction), and phenacetin (29% reduction)).

A striking example is the opposing effects of HMW- and LMW-HA on the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells; the binding of HMW-HA to CD44 inhibits cell cycle progression, whereas the binding of LMW-HA to CD44 stimulates cell cycle progression. We now report that cyclin D1 is the primary target of LMW-HA in human vascular smooth muscle cells, as it is for HMW-HA, and that the opposing cell cycle effects of these CD44 ligands result from differential regulation of signaling pathways to cyclin D1. HMW-HA binding to CD44 selectively inhibits the GTP loading of Rac and Rac-dependent signaling to the cyclin D1 gene, whereas LMW-HA binding to CD44 selectively stimulates ERK activation and ERK-dependent cyclin D1 gene expression. These data describe a novel mechanism of growth control in which a ligand-receptor system generates opposing effects on mitogenesis by differentially regulating signaling pathways to a common cell cycle target. They also emphasize how a seemingly subtle change in matrix composition can have a profound effect on cell proliferation.

Hyaluronan (HA) is a widely distributed component of the ECM (1Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 2Noble P.W. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Unlike ECM proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin, HA is a glycosaminoglycan with a molecular mass ranging from several million daltons (called native or high molecular weight HA (HMW-HA)) to 20–500 kDa (called lower molecular weight HA (LMW-HA)). HMW-HA is produced and secreted from several cell types where it is incorporated into the ECM and interacts in an autocrine and paracrine fashion with its receptors. LMW-HA can be synthesized de novo or generated from the enzymatic degradation or oxidative hydrolysis of HMW-HA, typically at sites of inflammation (2Noble P.W. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 3Hawkins C.L. Davies M.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1396-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Very small HA oligomers also have biological activities (4Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 1863-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), but their biological significance is less well understood. HA can bind to several cell surface receptors (6Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P. Hook M. Moore D. Cripps V. Austen L. Nance D.M. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 7Bono P. Rubin K. Higgins J.M. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), but the most extensively studied receptor for HA is CD44 (8Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 9Culty M. Miyake K. Kincade P.W. Sikorski E. Butcher E.C. Underhill C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). CD44 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a 72-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (10Puré E. Cuff C.A. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 213-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). CD44 is an endocytic receptor for HA (11Harada H. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5597-5607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and can also regulate classical signaling pathways, including Src family kinases and Rho family GTPases (12Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Sequential activation of the metalloproteinase, MMP-1, and presenilin-dependent γ-secretase releases a biologically active extracellular domain and intracellular domain from CD44, which appears to explain some of the effects of CD44 on gene transcription (13Nagano O. Saya H. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). CD44 plays an important role in regulation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton through an interaction with merlin and ERM proteins and also transmits signals that control differentiation, migration, and proliferation (14Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 15Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). In addition to HA, CD44 binds to other ligands, including osteopontin and MMPs (16Weber J.D. Raben D.M. Philips P.J. Baldassare J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 17Johnson C. Galis Z.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In fact, the binding of MMPs to CD44 promotes the MMP-dependent activation of TGF-β (18Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the signaling effects of CD44 can be direct, a consequence of cortical actin organization, or indirect through TGF-β. Both HMW-HA and LMW-HA bind to CD44 with similar affinities, but the biological outcome of the binding is distinct (10Puré E. Cuff C.A. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 213-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). For example, the binding of HMW-HA to CD44 antagonizes mitogen-induced cell cycle progression, whereas the binding of LMW-HA to CD44 stimulates cell cycle progression in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and fibroblasts (19Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S. Zhang Y. Belkin R. Yeh C. Secreto A. Assoian R.K. Rader D.J. Puré E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for these opposing proliferative effects of HMW-HA and LMW-HA remains unresolved. We recently reported that the anti-proliferative effect of HMW-HA reflects its ability to inhibit the mitogen-dependent induction of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein (20Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated by CD44 and likely independent of TGF-β activation because the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β are most closely linked to up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors, p15INK4b and p21cip1 (21Datto M.B. Hu P.P. Kowalik T.F. Yingling J. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2030-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signal transduction mechanism(s) by which HMW-HA binding to CD44 inhibits cyclin D1 gene expression remains unexplored. The cyclin D1 gene is the target of many mitogenic signaling pathways, but the best studied pathway to cyclin D1 is arguably the ERK-MAPK pathway. In several cell types, a sustained ERK activity between 3 and 6 h after mitogen stimulation results in the induction of cyclin D1 mRNA in mid-G1 phase, at least when cells are re-entering G1 phase from quiescence (22Balmanno K. Cook S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3085-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 23Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). A second common way to induce cyclin D1 mRNA is through Rac (24Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 25Klein E.A. Yang C. Kazanietz M.G. Assoian R.K. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1115-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Rac signaling to cyclin D1 requires NF-κB and results in a somewhat earlier induction of cyclin D1 within the G1 phase (23Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 26Fournier A.K. Campbell L.E. Castagnino P. Liu W.F. Chung B.M. Weaver V.M. Chen C.S. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Once expressed, cyclin D1 binds to cdk4 or cdk6 and initiates the inactivating phosphorylation of Rb that, in turn, controls the transcription of E2F-dependent genes and progression into S phase (27Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5108) Google Scholar, 28Dimova D.K. Dyson N.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2810-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In this study we show that the opposing effects of HMW-HA and LMW-HA on S phase entry do not reflect regulation of distinct cell cycle targets but rather opposing effects on the expression of cyclin D1 mRNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that HMW-HA inhibits cyclin D1 gene expression by selectively inhibiting Rac signaling to cyclin D1, whereas LMW-HA stimulates cyclin D1 gene expression by selectively stimulating ERK signaling to cyclin D1. Both effects require CD44. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a ligand-receptor system having opposing effects on mitogenesis by differentially regulating signaling pathways to a common cell cycle target. Cell Culture—Early passage human vascular SMCs were maintained and serum-starved at near confluence for 48 h as described (20Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Early passage vascular SMCs were isolated from wild-type and CD44-null C57Bl/6 mice and cultured as described (20Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from E14.5 background-matched wild-type or Skp2-null embryos (29Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The explanted MEFs were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and used at passage 2–4. Near confluent MEFs were serum-starved in DMEM, 1 mg/ml heat-inactivated fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 48 h. A concentrated solution of endotoxin-free LMW-HA solution (10 mg/ml; MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) or HMW-HA (10 mg/ml; Healon, Advanced Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA) was diluted to 200 μg/ml with DMEM. Unless noted otherwise, the solutions were supplemented with FBS (to 10 or 0.1% final concentrations for experiments with HMW-HA or LMW-HA, respectively) and directly added to the serum-starved cells. S phase entry was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy as described (20Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Klein E.A. Yung Y. Castagnino P. Kothapalli D. Assoian R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in cells incubated with BrdU from the time of FBS stimulation. Polymyxin B was typically added to the cells as described (20Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), although similar results were obtained in the absence or presence of polymyxin B. In some experiments, a species-specific blocking antibody to human CD44 (5F12; 50 μg/ml), or an irrelevant isotype-matched antibody, was added to the cultures ∼30 min before the addition of LMW-HA. The figures show representative results, typically from 3 to 4 independent experiments. Adenoviral Infections and siRNA Transfections—Adenoviral infections were performed as described (20Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using 106 human vascular SMCs in 100-mm dishes. The adenoviruses encoded LacZ, dominant negative Rac (RacN17), or a Rac-GAP (β2-chimerin). The infected, starved cells were washed once with serum-free DMEM before being incubated with 0.1% FBS in the presence or absence of LMW-HA (200 μg/ml). For siRNA-mediated knockdown, human vascular SMCs were trypsinized and reseeded (106 cells per 100-mm dish) in DMEM, 10% FBS without antibiotic overnight. The next day, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; 1 μl per 25,000 cells) and siRNAs (Ambion; 150 nm final concentration) were diluted in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and added to the confluent cells for 4 h before serum-starving the cells for an additional 24 h in fresh Opti-MEM (30Klein E.A. Yung Y. Castagnino P. Kothapalli D. Assoian R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with 0.1% FBS in the presence or absence of LMW-HA for 24 h. The siRNA sequences used to knockdown cyclin D1 and Rac1 have been described (30Klein E.A. Yung Y. Castagnino P. Kothapalli D. Assoian R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An additional Rac siRNA sequence used here was GAUUAUGACAGAUUACGCCtt. A nonspecific siRNA was used as control (AUUCUAUCACUAGCGUGAC; D-001206-10; Dharmacon Inc., Lafayette, CO). Rac Activation Assay—Near-confluent SMCs (∼105 cells per 35-mm dish) were serum-starved for 48 h. The cells were preincubated with 200 μg/ml HMW-HA or LMW-HA for 30 min at 37 °C before being stimulated for 3 or 5 min with 10% FBS or 0.1% FBS, respectively. Rac activity was determined using a G-LISA Rac Activation Assay Biochem Kit (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO). Cells were collected and lysed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Error bars indicate S.D. of triplicate measurements. Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (QPCR)—Cells washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline were extracted in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated. The levels of cyclin D1 mRNA, Skp2 mRNA, cdk4 mRNA, and 18 S rRNA were determined by QPCR as described (20Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Klein E.A. Yung Y. Castagnino P. Kothapalli D. Assoian R.K. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 155-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). QPCR results for cyclin D1 and Skp2 mRNAs were plotted relative to 18 S rRNA or cdk4 mRNA, neither of which varied reproducibly in response to the treatments used here. Error bars indicate S.D. of duplicate PCR reactions. Immunoblotting—SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions, and the fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters before immunoblotting with antibodies to cyclin D1, p27, cdk2, cdk4, Rac, Rb, and actin as described (23Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 31Villanueva J. Yung Y. Walker J.L. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 29109-29113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Autoradiograms were digitized by scanning, and figures were assembled using Adobe Photoshop. LMW-HA Synergizes with a Suboptimal Mitogenic Stimulus to Promote S Phase Entry—We previously reported that LMW-HA stimulates S phase entry in quiescent mouse vascular SMCs incubated in suboptimal (<1%) FBS, and that the effect requires CD44 (23Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, limitations in the numbers of murine vascular SMCs significantly hindered a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanism. We therefore confirmed the pro-mitogenic effect of LMW-HA, and the dependence on CD44, in human vascular SMCs (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). These initial experiments also showed that the potency of LMW-HA was similar to 10% FBS (supplemental Fig. 1A). Interestingly, LMW-HA could not stimulate S phase in the complete absence of FBS (supplemental Fig. 1C), indicating that LMW-HA binding to CD44 promotes mitogenesis by synergizing with a sub-optimal mitogenic stimulus. There was no apparent difference in cellular viability or morphology of vascular SMCs incubated in the absence or presence of 0.1% FBS or LMW-HA (supplemental Fig. 1D). Cyclin D1 Is the Primary Target of LMW-HA—We then determined the effect of LMW-HA on G1 phase cell cycle progression in human vascular SMCs. The inactivation of Rb is a mid-late G1 phase event that is mediated by cdk4/6- and cdk2-dependent phosphorylation, allows for the release of activator E2Fs, and is essential for S phase entry (28Dimova D.K. Dyson N.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2810-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 33Giacinti C. Giordano A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5220-5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). LMW-HA stimulated Rb hyperphosphorylation as determined by gel shift (Fig. 1A); it also activated the cyclin A promoter, an E2F target (34DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 35Knudsen K.E. Fribourg A.F. Strobeck M.W. Blanchard J.M. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27632-27641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and induced cyclin A mRNA (Fig. 1B). We mapped the effect of LMW-HA within the G1 phase cdks and found that LMW-HA stimulated the expression of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, C and D, respectively). LMW-HA also down-regulated the protein levels of the cdk inhibitor, p27 (Fig. 1E), but did not affect the expression of p27 mRNA (Fig. 1F). Levels of the two major G1 phase cdks, cdk4 and cdk2, were unaffected by LMW-HA (Fig. 1E). p21 levels were difficult to detect in these cells (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that the increased inactivation of Rb and S phase entry seen in response to LMW-HA results from up-regulation of cyclin D1, down-regulation of p27, and the consequent activation of constitutively expressed cdk4 and cdk2. The levels of p27 are typically controlled by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis through the ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, SCFSkp2 (36Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 37Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Skp2 is the substrate specificity component of the SCF complex, and its mRNA and protein levels are induced by mitogens as cells progress toward S phase from quiescence (38Yung Y. Walker J.L. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, we found that LMW-HA stimulated the expression of Skp2 mRNA and protein (Fig. 2A). A CD44-neutalizing antibody strongly inhibited the stimulatory effects of LMW-HA on cyclin D1 and Skp2 mRNAs (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). Furthermore, LMW-HA failed to stimulate the expression of cyclin D1 and Skp2 mRNAs in CD44-null SMCs (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, the effects of LMW-HA on both cyclin D1 and p27 require CD44. We recently reported that the down-regulation of p27 commonly seen in response to mitogenic stimulation can be a secondary consequence of cyclin D1 induction and cdk4/6 activation; cdk4/6-dependent inactivation of Rb promotes E2F release, which then induces Skp2 and decreases steady-state p27 levels (31Villanueva J. Yung Y. Walker J.L. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1457-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Yung Y. Walker J.L. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that the effects of LMW-HA on Skp2 and p27 levels were secondary to the induction of cyclin D1 because cyclin D1 knockdown with siRNA (Fig. 3A) eliminated the effect of LMW-HA on Skp2 gene induction (Fig. 3B) and p27 down-regulation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, knock-out of Skp2 did not prevent LMW-HA from inducing cyclin D1 mRNA (Fig. 3C), as would be expected if Skp2 up-regulation was a secondary (rather than primary) effect of LMW-HA. Collectively, these data indicate that cyclin D1 is the primary target of LMW-HA. Since our recent report showed that HMW-HA inhibits S phase entry by blocking the mitogen-dependent induction of cyclin D1 (20Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we conclude that the opposing effect of HMW-HA and LMW-HA are both exerted through a common cell cycle target, cyclin D1. Consistent with this conclusion, knockdown of cyclin D1 strongly inhibited S phase entry in response to LMW-HA (Fig. 3D). This result also indicates that cyclin D1 is the major D-type cyclin regulating S phase entry in this system. Opposing Effects of HMW- and LMW-HA on ERK- and Rac-dependent Cyclin D1 Gene Expression—The ERK-MAPK and Rac pathways have frequently been linked to the induction of cyclin D1 mRNA (see Introduction). We examined the effect of these pathways on FBS-stimulated cyclin D1 gene expression in human vascular SMCs and asked if these pathways might be differentially regulated by HMW-HA and LMW-HA. We found that FBS-stimulated induction of cyclin D1 mRNA (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4D) were not strongly affected by blocking ERK activation with the MEK inhibitor U0126. In contrast, ectopic expression of dominant negative Rac (RacN17), a Rac-GAP (β2-chimerin), or two distinct Rac1 siRNAs strongly inhibited cyclin D1 gene expression in FBS-stimulated human vascular SMCs (Fig. 4, B and C). Rac1 siRNA also blocked the FBS-stimulated induction of cyclin D1 protein (Fig. 4D). We then asked if HMW-HA and LMW-HA differentially affected ERK or Rac signaling to cyclin D1 mRNA. We examined sustained ERK activity (3–9 h after mitogenic stimulation) because that signaling period has been linked to the induction of cyclin D1 mRNA (see Introduction). We focused on much earlier times for Rac activation because the mitogen-stimulated GTP loading of Rac is known to decay rapidly. We found that the inhibitory effect of HMW-HA on FBS-stimulated cyclin D1 gene expression (Fig. 5A) was not associated with a decrease in ERK activation (Fig. 5B). However, HMW-HA strongly inhibited GTP loading of Rac in human vascular SMCs (Fig. 5C). Conversely, the stimulatory effect of LMW-HA on cyclin D1 gene expression (refer to Fig. 1) was not associated with a stimulation of Rac-GTP loading (Fig. 5C) nor did Rac siRNA inhibit the induction of cyclin D1 mRNA or S phase entry in LMW-HA-treated cells (Fig. 6, A–C). LMW-HA did result in the efficient activation of ERKs (assessed by immunoblotting for dually phosphorylated ERK1/2) in vascular SMCs incubated with 0.1% FBS (Fig. 6D). Importantly, the stimulatory effects of LMW-HA on ERK activity and cyclin D1 induction are causally linked because MEK/ERK inhibition with U0126 blocked the induction of cyclin D1 mRNA in response to LMW-HA (Fig. 6E). Collectively, these data show that HMW- and LMW-HA exert their opposing effects on cyclin D1 gene expression by differentially regulating the activation of Rac and ERK. By extension, we conclude that HA binding to CD44 can have opposing effects on mitogenesis because the high and lower molecular weight forms of HA differentially regulate the ERK- and Rac-signaling pathways to cyclin D1 mRNA.FIGURE 6Effect of LMW-HA on ERK and Rac signaling to cyclin D1 mRNA.A–C, quiescent human vascular SMCs were transfected with a nonspecific siRNA (control) or two distinct Rac1 siRNAs before being stimulated with either 0.1% FBS and 200 μg/ml LMW-HA, or 10% FBS, in the presence of BrdU. A, collected cells were lysed and immunoblotted for Rac and GAPDH (loading). B, total RNA was extracted and used to determine levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and 18 S rRNA. C, BrdU incorporation was determined at 24 h after stimulation. D, quiescent human vascular SMCs were incubated with 0.1% FBS for selected times in the absence or presence of LMW-HA. Collected cells were lysed and immunoblotted for dually phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and ERK1/2 (loading control). E, quiescent human vascular SMCs were incubated with 0.1% FBS and LMW-HA in the presence of DMSO (vehicle) or 25 μm U0126. Total RNA was extracted from some cells and used to determine levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and 18 S rRNA by QPCR. The expression of cyclin D1 mRNA was normalized to 18 S rRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results described here document the mechanism underlying the pro-mitogenic effect of LMW-HA, and begin to explain how HMW-HA and LMW-HA can have opposing effects on cell cycle progression despite binding to the same receptor, CD44. We show that LMW-HA stimulates the induction of cyclin D1 in cells exposed to a suboptimal mitogenic stimulus. LMW-HA also stimulates the expression of Skp2 and the down-regulation of p27kip1, but epistasis experiments (in which we depleted either cyclin D1 or Skp2) showed that the effects on Skp2 and p27 likely result from cyclin D1-dependent Rb inactivation. Thus, the effect of LMW-HA on cyclin D1 levels is primary and its effects on Skp2 and p27 levels are secondary. It is noteworthy that HMW-HA exerts its anti-mitogenic effect by inhibiting mitogen-dependent cyclin D1 induction in the same cells (20Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, HMW-HA and LMW-HA have opposing effects on the expression of cyclin D1, and in both cases, the HA effects require CD44 (this study and Refs. 19Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S.

These results emphasize how a seemingly subtle change in matrix composition, viz. the size of HA, can result in qualitatively distinct effects on cell proliferation. Recent studies indicate that CD44 can cooperate with TLR4 in mediating its signals (39Jiang D. Liang J. Noble P.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 435-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), but consistent with other reports (40Otsui K. Inoue N. Kobayashi S. Shiraki R. Honjo T. Takahashi M. Hirata K. Kawashima S. Yokoyama M. Heart Vessels. 2007; 22: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 41Heo S.-K. Yun H.-J. Noh E.-K. Park W.-H. Park S.-D. Immunol. Lett. 2008; 120: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect TLR4 surface expression by flow cytometry in unstimulated human vascular smooth muscle cells or following treatment with either HMW-HA or LMW-HA, nor did exposure to HMW-HA or LMW-HA have any pronounced effect on the surface levels of CD44 (data not shown). The ERK-MAPK pathway and the Rac pathway stimulate cyclin D1 gene expression in several cell types, and we show here that both pathways contribute to the mitogen-dependent induction of cyclin D1 mRNA in human vascular SMCs. ERK and Rac activities are stimulated in response to several receptor types, including receptor tyrosine kinases, integrins, and cadherins. Although signaling by CD44 is not well understood, the mechanisms by which CD44 is thought to signal (e.g. regulation of ERM proteins and release of its intracellular domain) are different from the canonical mechanisms associated with activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, integrins, and cadherins. Thus, it appears that a very divergent set of receptor-proximal signaling mechanisms converge to regulate the activation of ERKs and Rac. One of the salient findings in this study is that the opposing effects of HMW-HA and LMW-HA on cyclin D1 gene expression result from differential regulation of the ERK and Rac pathways to cyclin D1 mRNA (Fig. 7). Specifically, the inhibitory effect of HMW-HA results from inhibition of mitogen-dependent Rac-GTP loading (hence Rac signaling to cyclin D1), whereas the stimulatory effect of LMW-HA results from a strong enhancement of ERK activation in response to weak mitogenic stimulation. We do not yet understand how the binding of HMW-HA versus LMW-HA to CD44 differentially regulate the ERK and Rac pathways, but we speculate that it might involve differential association of ERM proteins or merlin (which have been linked to ERK and Rac) as well as differential binding of CD44 to a receptor tyrosine kinase or integrin (42Shaw R.J. Paez J.G. Curto M. Yaktine A. Pruitt W.M. Saotome I. O'Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Consistent with the latter notion, we note that others have attributed the effect of CD44 on platelet-derived growth factor responsiveness to an association between CD44 and the platelet-derived growth factor-BB receptor (44Li L. Heldin C.H. Heldin P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26512-26519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 45Li L. Asteriou T. Bernert B. Heldin C.H. Heldin P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In vivo, HA exists in a dynamic balance between its native, high molecular weight form and lower molecular weights forms that arise from the action of specific hyaluronidases or from oxidative degradation (see Introduction). The degradation of HMW-HA to LMW-HA occurs at sites of inflammation (as seen in atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and tumorigenesis), and we have previously proposed (20Kothapalli D. Zhao L. Hawthorne E.A. Cheng Y. Lee E. Puré E. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that this dynamic balance allows HA and CD44 to act as a proliferation rheostat. First, decreases in the levels of HMW-HA would reduce the anti-mitogenic effect of CD44. Second, the consequent increase in the levels of LMW-HA would enhance the pro-mitogenic effect of CD44. This study explains that the rheostat works by differentially regulating the ERK and Rac signaling pathways to a common cell cycle target, cyclin D1 (Fig. 7). Although our work has focused on cell cycle progression, it is noteworthy that ERK and Rac regulate cell migration and apoptosis as well as proliferation (46Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 47Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Differential coupling of CD44 to ERK and Rac by HMW- and LMW-HA may therefore have widespread implications for the physiological and pathological effects of CD44.

https://openalex.org/W2064717782,"Contrary to malignant melanoma, nevi are a benign form of melanocytic hyperproliferation. They are frequently observed as precursor lesions of melanoma, but they also feature biochemical markers of senescence. In particular, evidence for oncogene-induced melanocyte senescence as natural means to prevent tumorigenesis has been obtained in nevi with mutated B-Raf(V600E). Here, we demonstrate that strong oncogenic growth factor receptor signalling drives melanocytes into senescence, whereas weaker signals keep them in the proliferative state. Activation of oncogene-induced senescence also produces multinucleated giant cells, a long known histological feature of nevus cells. The protein levels of the senescence mediators, p53 and pRB, and their upstream activators do not correlate with senescence. However, strong oncogene signalling leads to pronounced reactive oxygen stress, and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) efficiently prevents the formation of multinucleated cells and senescence. Similarly, expression of oncogenic N-RAS results in ROS generation, DNA damage and the same multinuclear senescent phenotype. Hence, we identified oncogenic signalling-dependent ROS production as critical mediator of the melanocytic multinuclear phenotype and senescence, both of them being hallmarks of human nevus cells."
https://openalex.org/W2046849136,"Visual sensitivity is degraded while the eyes are moving. This study now finds that sensitivity for some kinds of visual stimuli is actually improved during smooth pursuit eye movements. These sensitivity increases are likely to originate from the parvocellular retino-thalamic system. When we view the world around us, we constantly move our eyes. This brings objects of interest into the fovea and keeps them there, but visual sensitivity has been shown to deteriorate while the eyes are moving. Here we show that human sensitivity for some visual stimuli is improved during smooth pursuit eye movements. Detection thresholds for briefly flashed, colored stimuli were 16% lower during pursuit than during fixation. Similarly, detection thresholds for luminance-defined stimuli of high spatial frequency were lowered. These findings suggest that the pursuit-induced sensitivity increase may have its neuronal origin in the parvocellular retino-thalamic system. This implies that the visual system not only uses feedback connections to improve processing for locations and objects being attended to, but that a whole processing subsystem can be boosted. During pursuit, facilitation of the parvocellular system may reduce motion blur for stationary objects and increase sensitivity to speed changes of the tracked object."

In a process termed transformation, ligand binding converts the AhR into its high affinity DNA binding form that represents a dimer of the AhR and Arnt, a closely related nuclear protein. During transformation, protein chaperone Hsp90 is thought to be replaced by Arnt in overlapping binding sites in the basic helix loop helix and PASB domains of the AhR. Here, analysis of AhR variants containing a modified PASB domain and AhR PASA-PASB fragments of various lengths revealed (i) an inhibitory effect on transformation concomitant with Hsp90 binding in the PASB domain, (ii) an ability of the PASA-PASB fragment of the AhR to reproduce key steps in the transformation process, and (iii) a ligand-dependent conformational change in the PASA domain consistent with increased PASA exposure during AhR transformation. Based on these results, we propose a new mechanism of AhR transformation through initiation of Arnt dimerization and Hsp90 displacement in AhR PASA/B domains.

Toxicol. 2003; 43: 309-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The AhR belongs to the family of basic helix loop helix (bHLH) and Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain proteins that also includes mouse HIF1α, SimI, and CLOCK proteins (3Kewley R.J. Whitelaw M.L. Chapman-Smith A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In its native unliganded state, the AhR is cytosolic and exists in a complex with two molecules of Hsp90 and the proteins XAP2 and p23 (4Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2002; 141: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, Hsp90 binding is thought to maintain the AhR in an inactive state, possibly, through association in the regions that overlap AhR Arnt binding sites (bHLH and PASA/B domains) (5Pongratz I.

Hsp90 appears to bind to the ligand-binding PASB and N-terminal DNA-binding bHLH domains and following ligand binding, remains associated with the AhR during nuclear translocation (6Fukunaga B.N.

Once in the nucleus, Hsp90 dissociates or is more likely displaced by Arnt from their overlapping binding sites in the AhR leading to formation of an active transcriptional dimer of AhR/Arnt (9Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Agbunag R.V. Ong M.S. Hankinson O. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 511-518PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of the AhR into its high affinity DNA binding form is termed transformation and is presumably driven by a ligand binding-mediated conformational change in the AhR. Although the occurrence of conformational change(s) in the AhR has been suggested by limited proteolysis (10Henry E.C. Gasiewicz T.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Kronenberg S. Esser C. Carlberg C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2286-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), mechanism and functional significance of the presumed conformational change(s) during AhR transformation remain mostly unknown. It has been previously suggested that ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of the AhR complex results from exposure of its nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in the bHLH domain, with the exposed bHLH domain providing a binding surface that allows initiation of Arnt dimerization (12Ikuta T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5811-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism still remains to be proven experimentally, and certain evidence such as the disparate effects of the Hsp90 stabilizing agent sodium molybdate on AhR transformation and nuclear translocation do not suggest a mechanistic connection between these steps of AhR activation (8Heid S.E. Pollenz R.S. Swanson H.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 82-92PubMed Google Scholar). The AhR contains two repeats of the PAS motif, the PASA and PASB domains. Although the PASA domain is essential for formation of the stable AhR:Arnt dimer, the PASB domain contains a ligand binding site and one of the Hsp90 binding sites (6Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25291-25300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The PASB domain has been suggested to exert an inhibitory effect on AhR transformation and its deletion results in an AhR that is constitutively active with respect to its transformation/DNA binding and transcriptional activation functions (16Dolwick K.M. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8566-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17McGuire J. Okamoto K. Whitelaw M.L. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although the ability of Hsp90 to bind to the PASB deleted AhR was not determined, the constitutive activity of this AhR suggests deficient Hsp90 binding and/or exposure of the Arnt dimerization interface(s) on the AhR. Either of these events (loss of Hsp90 binding or exposure of the Arnt dimerization interface) could be initiating AhR transformation, and the PASB domain appears to play central role in ligand dependence of such initiation. Nonetheless, the overall mechanism of the AhR transformation and the role of various AhR domains remain to be elucidated. Accordingly, here we describe a series of studies examining the molecular events involved in the initiation of AhR transformation (loss of Hsp90 and Arnt dimerization). Our results are consistent with a mechanism by which AhR transformation is mediated through ligand-dependent initiation of Arnt dimerization within the AhR PAS domains and further our understanding of the molecular events in AhR signal transduction.

In Vitro Protein Expression and Ligand-dependent Transformation—Wild type mAhR, mArnt, mAhR variants, GST fusion constructs, and GST were synthesized in vitro in the presence of l-[35S]methionine (MP Biomedicals) or unlabeled l-methionine using the TnT Quick-coupled transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega). The resulting AhR and Arnt translation mixtures were mixed in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio for DNA binding and dimerization experiments and in a 1:3 ratio for Hsp90 dissociation studies, and incubated with 20 nm TCDD or 2% (v/v) DMSO (the solvent control) for 1-2 h at room temperature. For FLAG co-immunoprecipitations, the in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled AhR variants were transformed in the presence of Arnt-FLAG protein instead of Arnt.

The primary anti-AhR antibody SE-6 was added at 0.2 mg/ml and detection performed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting analysis system (GE Healthcare). Hsp90 Binding to the bHLH and PASB Sites of the AhR—It has been previously suggested that Hsp90 maintains the AhR in an inactive state through its binding to at least two separate regions, the bHLH and PASB domains, although the exact sequences involved remain to be determined (6Fukunaga B.N.

Deletion of the ligand binding PASB domain (amino acids 287-422) generates an active (ligand-independent) AhR that constitutively dimerizes with Arnt, binds to DNA, is capable of nuclear translocation, and activates gene transcription (17McGuire J. Okamoto K. Whitelaw M.L. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41841-41849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) despite the fact that it retains one Hsp90 binding site (in the bHLH domain). These observations raise the question whether the Hsp90-mediated inhibitory effect on AhR transformation is binding site dependent (e.g. is mediated by Hsp90 bound to the PASB domain). However, Hsp90 binding to this PASB-deleted AhR (AhRΔPASB) was not previously determined. To analyze Hsp90 binding to this deletion variant, an identical AhRΔPASB expression construct (Fig. 1a) was generated and the AhRΔPASB protein synthesized in vitro. Although the level of protein expression of the AhRΔPASB protein was comparable with that of the wild type AhR (wtAhR, compare input lanes in Fig. 1b), we detected little Hsp90 binding to AhRΔPASB (5.6% of input compared with 54% of input for the wtAhR (Fig. 1b)). The observed deficient Hsp90 binding to the AhRΔPASB likely explains the previously observed constitutive activity of this construct in AhR transformation and nuclear translocation (17McGuire J. Okamoto K. Whitelaw M.L. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41841-41849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Deletion of the PASB domain was sufficient to destabilize Hsp90 binding to the bHLH domain of the AhRΔPASB protein, although it has been previously reported that C-terminal deletion of the AhR containing the bHLH but not the PASB domains could bind Hsp90 (6Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29270-29278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 7Perdew G.H. Bradfield C.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 589-593PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggested that a change in the overall structure of the AhR resulting from the internal deletion may destabilize Hsp90 binding in the bHLH domain of AhRΔPASB. To minimize destabilizing structural effects of internal deletion, we generated a chimeric AhR, in which the AhR PASB domain (amino acids 263-409) was substituted with the comparable PASB domain of Arnt (amino acids 326-470) (Fig. 1a). The exchanged region in this AhR/PASB-Arnt chimera was slightly different from that of the original deletion in the AhRΔPASB to allow swapping of structurally homologous regions between the two proteins. Interestingly, whereas Arnt does not bind Hsp90 (7Perdew G.H. Bradfield C.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 589-593PubMed Google Scholar) and the AhRΔPASB is deficient in this binding, insertion of the Arnt PASB domain partially restored Hsp90 binding to the chimeric AhR as compared with the AhRΔPASB (compare 29% of input for AhR/PASB-Arnt to 5.6% of input for AhRΔPASB and 54% of input for wtAhR, Fig. 1b). These results suggest that some loss in Hsp90 binding in AhRΔPASB is likely due to a change in the overall structure of the AhR and the remainder due to loss of the Hsp90 binding within PASB. We assume that the restored Hsp90 binding occurs within the AhR bHLH domain binding site of AhR/PASB-Arnt because Arnt (and presumably the Arnt PASB) does not bind Hsp90 (7Perdew G.H. Bradfield C.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 39: 589-593PubMed Google Scholar). Although removal/reduction of Hsp90 inhibitory association may explain previously reported ligand-independent transformation and nuclear translocation by the AhRΔPASB (17McGuire J. Okamoto K. Whitelaw M.L. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41841-41849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it was of interest to analyze these activation steps for AhR/PASB-Arnt because this AhR variant retained some Hsp90 binding. AhR transformation of the wtAhR, AhRΔPASB, and the AhR/PASB-Arnt chimeras was examined indirectly by measuring AhR DNA binding using gel retardation analysis (22Denison M.S. Rogers J.M. Rushing S.R. Jones C.L. Tetangco S.C. Heath-Pagliuso S. Morgan K.S. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley, New York2002: 4.8.1-4.8.45Google Scholar). As expected, a ligand-dependent increase in complex formation was only observed with the wtAhR, whereas AhRΔPASB exhibited constitutive DNA binding activity (Fig. 2a). The significantly higher amount of DNA binding by the AhRΔPASB (Fig. 2, a and b) is consistent with decreased association with Hsp90 in this AhR variant. Despite retaining some Hsp90 binding, the AhR/PASB-Arnt construct also demonstrated ligand-independent dimerization and DNA binding (Fig. 2a) suggesting that the presumed lack of Hsp90 binding to the PASB domain of this chimera is sufficient to allow constitutive Arnt dimerization, AhR transformation, and DNA binding. Interestingly, the levels of constitutive DNA binding by AhR/PASB-Arnt were similar to that of wtAhR in the presence of TCDD (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the similarity in kinetics of the time course of transformation/DNA binding of these two proteins (Fig. 2b) suggests similarities in the mechanism of dimerization/DNA binding between the ligand-bound wtAhR and AhR/PASB-Arnt. These findings are consistent with the previously suggested inhibitory role of the AhR PASB domain in AhR transformation (16Dolwick K.M. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8566-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 18Lindebro M.C. Poellinger L. Whitelaw M.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3528-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and suggest that although the AhR PASB is important in ligand-dependent control of transformation, it contributes little to maximum levels and kinetics of AhR:Arnt dimerization and DNA binding. To analyze cellular localization of the constructs of interest, wtAhR, AhRΔPASB, and AhR/PASB-Arnt were tagged at the C-terminal end with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The resulting constructs demonstrated unchanged levels of protein expression, Hsp90 binding, and DNA binding compared with their untagged counterparts (). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with YPF-tagged AhR constructs, incubated in the presence of TCDD (or solvent control DMSO) for 1-2 h, and AhR localization determined by fluorescence microscopy. Cells transfected with the control vector pcDNA3 did not produce a fluorescent signal (data not shown). Although incubation of the transiently transfected COS-1 cells with TCDD resulted in a shift of fluorescent signal of the wtAhR-YFP from cytosolic and cytosolic/nuclear localization to predominantly nuclear localization (indicating nuclear import of the AhR complex), AhRΔPASB-YFP fluorescence was primarily localized within the nuclei independent of ligand, as expected (Fig. 3a). In contrast, (AhR/PASB-Arnt)-YFP exhibited predominantly cytosolic and cytosolic/nuclear localization (Fig. 3a) and it was expressed at levels comparable with that of AhRΔPASB as determined by Western blotting assay (Fig. 3b). It is unclear why AhR/PASB-Arnt was less efficient in nuclear translocation than AhRΔPASB or wtAhR in the presence of TCDD, although presumed Hsp90 binding to the bHLH domain of this AhR chimera may mask the NLS. Nonetheless, it is significant that the same AhR protein was fully active in transformation in vitro (as evidenced by DNA binding, Fig. 2) and yet inactive in nuclear translocation. Although the previously proposed mechanism of initiation of AhR transformation through the bHLH domain relied on presumed ligand-dependent exposure of this domain (which contains the NLS), the example of the AhR/PASB-Arnt demonstrates that the AhR protein may not need to be able to translocate into the nucleus to be active in AhR transformation (conversion into its DNA binding form). Role of the PASA and PASB Domains in the AhR Transformation—Constitutive transformation of the AhR/PASB-Arnt in vitro suggests that this process may be initiated through AhR PAS domains because exposure of the bHLH domain of this chimeric AhR (where the NLS is located) appears to be restricted due to its lack of constitutive nuclear localization in transfected cells (Fig. 3a). Because in the inactive state, Hsp90 is associated with the Arnt dimerization interface in the AhR, the hypothetical mechanism of initiation of AhR transformation through the PASB may involve ligand-dependent dissociation of Hsp90 from the binding site in this domain. To test this possibility, we examined various steps of AhR transformation (ligand binding, Hsp90 displacement and dimerization with Arnt) using AhR-GST fusions containing various lengths of AhR PASA and PASB domains as well as GST full-length AhR. A GST tag was added to stabilize and rapidly isolate the expressed protein fragments for analysis. GST-AhR 1, 2, and 3 span amino acids 230-421, 167-421, and 83-421 of the wtAhR, respectively (Fig. 4a), and were each expressed in vitro at levels comparable with that of wtAhR and free GST (Fig. 4b and Table 1), although protein expression levels of GST-AhR-FL were significantly lower. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that all constructs exhibited high levels of Hsp90 binding (37-45% of input), comparable with that of wtAhR (46% of input, Fig. 4b), whereas the GST negative control protein alone did not bind Hsp90 (Fig. 4b). Thus, whereas GST-AhR-FL was expressed at much lower levels, it had similar Hsp90 binding suggesting that its protein stability was not due to deficient association with Hsp90. However, we chose to not perform functional studies on this construct due to the low levels of expression and functional activity in transformation studies (data not shown). In contrast, we observed that the GST-AhR 1-3 constructs were fully active in AhR transformation (as detected by dimerization with Arnt and Hsp90 displacement, Fig. 5). Thus, whereas these protein fragments differ from the full-length AhR and have an added tag, their ability to undergo transformation suggested that activities of the PASA and PASB domains in the AhR transformation are retained in isolation from the other AhR domains.TABLE 1Protein expression and ligand binding activity of GST fusions relative to that of wtAhRGST fusionNumber of methioninesProtein expressionaValues presented are relative to the amount of [3H]TCDD specific binding to wtAhR and are exp"
https://openalex.org/W2163198888,"Cholesterol-rich clusters of SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) proteins have been implicated as being important for exocytosis. Here we demonstrate the significance of cholesterol for normal biphasic insulin secretion in mouse beta cells by removal of cholesterol from the plasma membrane using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD). Maximal inhibition of insulin secretion in static incubations was achieved using 0.1 mM MBCD. In in situ pancreatic perfusion measurements, both first and second phase insulin secretions were reduced by approximately 50% (P<0.05). This was accompanied by a reduced number of docked large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) (approximately 40%; P<0.01) and a reduced exocytotic response (>50%; P<0.01). Further, subcellular fractionations demonstrated movement of the synaptosomal protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) from the plasma membrane to the cytosol after MBCD treatment. The inhibitory actions of MBCD were counteracted by subsequent addition of cholesterol. We hypothesize that desorption of cholesterol leads to the disturbance of a basic exocytotic mechanism partly due to migration of SNAP-25, and we conclude that insulin secretion is highly sensitive to changes in plasma membrane cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W2026403135,"Type III collagen is a critical collagen that comprises extensible connective tissue such as skin, lung, and the vascular system. Mutations in the type III collagen gene, COL3A1, are associated with the most severe forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. A characteristic feature of type III collagen is the presence of a stabilizing C-terminal cystine knot. Crystal structures of collagen triple helices reported so far contain artificial sequences like (Gly-Pro-Pro)n or (Gly-Pro-Hyp)n. To gain insight into the structural properties exhibited by the natural type III collagen triple helix, we synthesized, crystallized, and determined the structure of a 12-triplet repeating peptide containing the natural type III collagen sequence from residues 991 to 1032 including the C-terminal cystine knot region, to 2.3Å resolution. This represents the longest collagen triple helical structure determined to date with a native sequence. Strikingly, the Gly991–Gly1032 structure reveals that the central non-imino acid-containing region adopts 10/3 superhelical properties, whereas the imino acid rich N- and C-terminal regions adhere to a 7/2 superhelical conformation. The structure is consistent with two models for the cystine knot; however, the poor density for the majority of this region suggests that multiple conformations may be adopted. The structure shows that the multiple non-imino acids make several types of direct intrahelical as well as interhelical contacts. The looser superhelical structure of the non-imino acid region of collagen triple helices combined with the extra contacts afforded by ionic and polar residues likely play a role in fibrillar assembly and interactions with other extracellular components.

Collagens are the most abundant proteins in animals, comprising an estimated one-third of the total protein by weight (1Myllyharju J.

Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 2Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). In addition, more than 20 additional proteins adopt collagen-like structures such as collectins, ficolins, and scavenger receptors (2Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Collagen is an essential molecule in vertebrates, because it plays the dominant role in maintaining the structure of tissues. However, collagen and collagen-like proteins have many other important roles, such as cell adhesion, chemotaxis, cell migration, and the regulation of tissue remodeling during cell growth, differentiation, morphogenesis, and wound healing (2Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). All collagen molecules consist of three polypeptide chains, called α chains, which contain at least one region of repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa sequences (1Myllyharju J. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 2Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). In the collagen molecule, the three α chains each fold into a polyproline II-like left-handed structure, and the three polyproline II-like chains twist around each other to form a right-handed superhelix, called the collagen triple helix (4Rich A. Crick F.H. Nature. 1955; 176: 915-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 5Brodsky B. Persikov A.V. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 301-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 6Okuyama K. Wu G. Jiravanichanun N. Hongo C. Noguchi K.

Critical to the formation of the triple helix is the presence of a glycine residue at each third position in the chain because this residue is the only one that can exist in the small space at the center of the triple helix (8Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Tuderman L. Guzman N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 301: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Each of the three chains therefore has the repeating structure Gly-Xaa-Yaa, in which Xaa and Yaa can be any amino acid but are frequently the imino acids proline in the Xaa position and hydroxyproline (Hyp) in the Yaa position. Because both proline and Hyp are rigid, cyclic imino acids, they limit rotation of the polypeptide backbone and thus contribute to the stability of the triple helix. Collagen polypeptides that lack Hyp can fold into a triple helical conformation at low temperatures, but the triple helix formed is not stable at mammalian body temperature (8Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Tuderman L. Guzman N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1979; 301: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The number of Gly-Pro-Hyp repeats is the main, but not exclusive, factor in determining collagen thermostability (9Burjanadze T.V. Biopolymers. 2000; 53: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Approximately 90% of collagen tripeptide units contain at least one non-imino acid residue in the Xaa and/or Yaa position, and these residues likely play a role in collagen structure, stability, and function (5Brodsky B. Persikov A.V. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 301-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 6Okuyama K. Wu G. Jiravanichanun N. Hongo C. Noguchi K.

Indeed, a notable feature of the collagen triple helix is that the amino acids occupying Xaa and Yaa positions are solvent-accessible. Because of this, these residues would be predicted to play important roles in interactions with other molecules, such as extracellular matrix proteins. In addition, these residues are predicted to be important in collagen triple helix self-association leading to fibril formation. The best characterized and most common collagen fibril form is the 67-nm (D) periodic fibril, which is observed in most connective tissues (10Bruns R.R. Gross J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Doyle B.B. Hulmes D.J.S. Miller A. Parry D.A.D. Piez K.A. Woodhead-Galloway J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1974; 187: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Collagen types I, II, III, V, and XI self-associate to form these characteristic fibrils. Studies suggest that the axial staggering of collagen molecules that give rise to these fibrils is due to electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between neighboring molecules (12Hulmes D.J.S.

Specifically, oppositely charged residues in the Xaa and Yaa position of the collagen triple helix are predicted to play a role in determining the axial stagger of the fibril (11Doyle B.B.

Such charged residues have also been implicated in the interactions between macrophage scavenger receptor and other molecules and the hexamer formation of the serum complement protein C1q (15Acton S.

Kontusaari S. Baldwin C.T. Kuivaniemi H. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Type III collagen is the second most abundant collagen in human tissues after type I and is primarily found in tissues exhibiting elastic properties, such as skin, blood vessels, and internal organs. Type III collagen is common in fast growing tissue, particularly at the early stages of wound repair (19Haukipuro K. Risteli L. Kairaluoma M.I. Risteli J. Ann. Surg. 1987; 206: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M. Krane S. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1852-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Mutant mice have been generated by gene targeting in which the type III collagen gene (COL3A1) has been knocked out (20Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M. Krane S. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1852-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). These knock-out mice exhibit irregularly sized collagen fibers in the skin dermis as well as the aortic adventitia, which indicates the importance of type III collagen in regulating collagen fiber size. Notably, type III collagen null mice die perinatally, usually because of blood vessel or intestinal rupture. Thus, these data demonstrate that type III collagen is necessary for proper organ and tissue function, especially in distensible organs. These findings are consistent with the fact that mutations of type III collagen cause the most severe form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, EDS IV, 3The abbreviations used are: EDS, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous diffraction; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; ASU, asymmetric unit. which affect internal organs, arteries, joints, and skin. Indeed, EDS IV can result in sudden death when the large arteries rupture (20Liu X. Wu H. Byrne M. Krane S. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1852-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The most severe forms of EDS IV are correlated with point mutations that substitute a residue for a glycine near the C-terminal end of the triple helix, including G1012R, G1018V, and G1021E (21Smith L.T. Schwarze U. Goldstein J. Byers P.H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Structurally, type III collagen is a homotrimer composed of three α1(III) chains and resembles other fibrillar collagens. A key feature in the formation of type III collagen is a so-called disulfide or cystine knot, which is located between the triple helical region and the C-terminal telopeptide (22Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Allmann H. Fietzek P.P. Glanville R.W. Kühn K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 861-868PubMed Google Scholar). The knot is formed by three interchain disulfide bonds, and it significantly stabilizes the triple helical structure. The stability imparted by the disulfide knot has been successfully used to produce collagenous peptides that otherwise would be too unstable to study (24Mechling D.E. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14532-14536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Boulègue C. Musiol H.J. Götz M.G. Renner C. Moroder L. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Production of these peptides involves the C-terminal extension by the bis-cysteinyl-sequence GPCCG, followed by air or glutathione oxidation at lower temperature under slightly basic conditions. In the 1950s two structural models for collagen with different fiber periods and helical symmetries were proposed based on the fiber diffraction pattern of native collagen. These were the 7/2 helical model with a 20-Å axial repeat (26Cohen H. Br. J. Phys. Med. 1953; 16: 169-170PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cowan P.M. McGavin S. North A.C. Nature. 1955; 176: 1062-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and the 10/3 helical model with a 30-Å axial repeat (27Cowan P.M. McGavin S. North A.C. Nature. 1955; 176: 1062-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These single-helical models were discarded after the proposal of a triple helical structure with 10/3 helical symmetry and a 28.6-Å axial repeat by Ramachandran and Kartha (28Ramachandran G.N. Kartha G. Nature. 1955; 174: 269-270Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 showed a triple helix with 7/2 helical symmetry with a 20-Å axial repeat (29Okuyama K. Tanaka N. Ashida T. Kakudo M. Sakakibara S. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, the fiber diffraction analysis of native collagen was performed based on the advanced diffraction data acquisition techniques and revealed that the x-ray diffraction data can be explained not only by the prevailing 10/3 helical model but also by the 7/2 helical model (7Okuyama K. Xu X. Iguchi M. Noguchi K. Biopolymers. 2006; 84: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Almost all of the high resolution structures of model peptides adopt a 7/2 helical symmetry, and the conformation close to the 10/3 helix appears only in the guest region of host-guest peptides, like the T3-785 peptide and the integrin-binding protein complexed with integrin (7Okuyama K. Xu X. Iguchi M. Noguchi K. Biopolymers. 2006; 84: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Crystallization and structure determination of collagen peptides is a challenging task. All of the available crystal structures are of either artificial mimics (like (GPP)n or (GPO)n, where O = 4(R)-hydroxyproline) or host-guest peptides where a short stretch of one to three native tripeptide units are flanked by three to five GPO repeats. Unfortunately, these structures give only limited insight into how side chains other than imino acid residues in the Xaa and Yaa positions contribute to collagen structure and stability (30Berisio R.

The length of a collagen peptide is an important determinant in crystallization. Longer fragments impart higher flexibility, which may impede crystallization, whereas the production of a thermally stable triple helix actually requires longer sequences and the addition of artificial stabilizing tripeptide units, like GPO. These factors have limited the length of collagen fragments that have crystallized to only nine to eleven tripeptide units. Furthermore, this has restricted the number of integrated native tripeptide units to only one to three. One strategy used to obtain structural information on a longer triple helix was to fuse a stable trimeric molecule, foldon, which is a trimerization domain of fibritin, to a (GPP)10 collagen mimic (44Frank S. Jenny M. Schulthess T. Kammerer R.A. Boudko S. Landwehr R. Okuyama K. Engel J. Structure. 2003; 11: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The resulting crystal structure revealed that there was a dramatic kink between the (GPP)10 triple helix and the foldon domain, which permitted adaptation to the mismatch between the 3-fold rotation symmetry of the foldon domain and the one residue stagger of the collagenous structure (45Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bächinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Here we describe another approach to stabilize a long collagen triple helix structure by the use of a native type III collagen C-terminal disulfide knot (46Frank S. Boudko S. Mizuno K. Schulthess T. Engel J. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7747-7750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 47Barth D. Kyrieleis O. Frank S. Renner C. Moroder L.

Specifically, we crystallized a 42-residue collagen peptide containing the C-terminal type III collagen sequence from residues 991 to 1032, which contains the residues most commonly mutated in very severe forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome IV. This peptide also contains the native C-terminal cystine knot region. Thus, we demonstrate that utilization of the cystine knot opens doors to crystallization of lengthy and native collagen fragments. Peptide Sequences—The sequence of the type III collagen peptide used in this study is as follows: (GPI GPO GPR GNR GER GSE GSO GHO GsMO GPO GPO GAO GPCCGG)3.(Ois 4(R)-hydroxyproline, and sM is l-selenomethionine). These residues correspond to residues 991–1032 of the human collagen III a chain, with exception of the l-selenomethionine, which was substituted in place of the wild type glutamine for use in multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—The peptide was synthesized on an ABI433A peptide synthesizer with 0.25 mm Fmoc-Gly-PEG-PS resin, a 4-fold excess of Fmoc amino acids and O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate as activating agent. The Fmoc amino acids carried the protection groups Cys-Trt, Hyp-t-Bu, Gln-Trt, His-Trt, Ser-t-Bu, Glu-O-t-Bu, Arg-Pbf, Asn-Trt, and Tyr-t-Bu. The peptide was cleaved off the resin and deprotected for 4 h at room temperature with 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, 3% 1,2-ethanedithiol, 2% anisole. Subsequently, the peptide was precipitated in cold ether, redissolved in H2O, and lyophilized. The reduced peptide was then purified by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA; 50 × 250 mm, 10–15-μm particle size, 300-Å pores) with an acetonitrile/water gradient and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as ion-pairing agent. Finally, the peptide was characterized by electrospray/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-tof micro; Waters Associates) and amino acid analysis. Peptide Folding, Oxidation, and Purification of Disulfide-linked Trimer—The lyophilized, reduced peptide was dissolved in degassed and N2 saturated 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, under N2 atmosphere and was kept at 4 °C for 24 h to allow triple helix formation prior to oxidation. Two strategies of oxidation were used: exposure to atmospheric O2 or addition of reduced (10 mm) and oxidized (1 mm) glutathione and exposure to atmospheric O2. In both cases, the pH was raised to 8.3 with a saturated solution of Tris. Oxidation was carried out for 5–7 days, and the peptide mass was periodically analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The maximum yield of covalently linked trimeric peptide was ∼60–70% and was slightly higher when glutathione was used for oxidation. To separate covalently linked trimeric peptide from other oligomers, the oxidized crude material was dissolved in deionized 8 m urea solution with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to prevent disulfide exchange and applied to a sieve column. Trimer-containing fractions were pooled out and further purified by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column. Peptide Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—The purified and lyophilized covalently linked trimeric collagen III peptide, Gly991–Gly1032, was dissolved at a concentration of 15 mg/ml in 5 mm acetic acid. The peptide was crystallized at 22 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For crystallization, 2 μl of the peptide solution was mixed with 2 μl of the reservoir solution of 20% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550. The crystals appeared as very thin plates in a period of 1–5 days and are monoclinic, space group P21 with a = 31.98 Å, b = 21.52 Å, c = 68.97 Å, and β = 92.58°. Although the crystals diffracted beyond 2.5-Å resolution, they displayed extremely high mosaic spread (>3.0°) even when x-ray intensity data were collected at room temperature. Thus, several strategies for cryoprotection were tried in an attempt to improve the quality of the diffraction. The data were collected at ALS Beamline 8.2.1. Good quality data were obtained for only one crystal. For this data collection, glycerol was first added to the drop containing the crystal to a final concentration of 10%. The drop sat for 8 h, and the crystal was placed directly in the cryostream. However, at this point the mosaic spread was still unacceptably high. Thus, the crystal was annealed several times by removing the crystal from the cryostream and placing back in the drop solution. After two annealing cycles the diffraction, although still highly mosaic (1.7°), was of sufficient quality to collect data. A complete three wavelength MAD data set was collected on this crystal and was used for structure determination. The positions of the three selenomethionines in the triple helix were obtained using SOLVE. The phases obtained from these positions were improved by density modification in CNS, and the resulting density modified map was used for model building in O (50Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J.

Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). After two-thirds of the structure was built, phase combination using phases from the partial model was used to improve the map. This permitted the current structure, which consists of one complete triple helix in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (ASU) to be built. Multiple cycles of simulated annealing, xyzb refinement, and rebuilding in O resulted in an Rwork/Rfree of 24.3%/27/4% to 2.30 Å resolution. The current model has excellent stereochemistry (Table 1) (53Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Multiple omit maps were calculated throughout the process to confirm the correctness of the model. Nonetheless, the electron density of the cystine knot residues remained poor, and the C-terminal residues that precede the cysteine residues display high B-factors consistent with this region being disordered or consisting of multiple conformations.TABLE 1Selected crystallographic data for Gly991–Gly1032 structureWavelength (λ)0.97971.02000.9796Resolution (Å)68.84-2.3068.78-2.3068.84-2.30Overall Rsym(%)aRsym = ΣΣ|Ihkl – Ihkl(j)|/ΣIhkl, where Ihkl(j) is the observed intensity and Ihkl is the final average value of intensity7.5 (24.6)bThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell6.2 (24.5)7.6 (24.5)Overall I/σ(I)20.5 (2.5)20.4 (2.3)20.4 (2.5)No. of total reflections19,65719,64019,658No. of unique reflections396439623960Multiplicity5.05.05.0Overall figure of meritcFigure of merit = <|ΣP(α)eiα/ΣP(α)| >, where α is the phase and P(α) is the phase probability distribution0.490Crystal parametersSpace groupP21Cell parameters (Å)a = 31.98, b = 21.52, c = 68.97, β = 92.58°Resolution (Å)68.8-2.30Overall Rsym(%)aRsym = ΣΣ|Ihkl – Ihkl(j)|/ΣIhkl, where Ihkl(j) is the observed intensity and Ihkl is the final average value of intensity6.2(24.5)Overall I/σ(I)20.4 (2.3)No. of total reflections19640No. of unique reflections3962Refinement statisticsResolution (Å)68.8-2.30Rwork/Rfree(%)dRwork = Σ||Fobs| – |Fcalc||/Σ|Fobs| and Rfree = Σ||Fobs| – |Fcalc||/Σ|Fobs|, where all of the reflections belong to a test set of 5% randomly selected data24.3/27.4Root mean square deviationBond angles (°)1.92Bond lengths (Å)0.008B values (Å2)1.5Ramachandran analysisMost favored (%/no.)92.9/52Additionally allowed (%/no.)7.1/4Generously allowed (%/no.)0.0/0Disallowed (%/no.)0.0/0a Rsym = ΣΣ|Ihkl – Ihkl(j)|/ΣIhkl, where Ihkl(j) is the observed intensity and Ihkl is the final average value of intensityb The values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shellc Figure of merit = <|ΣP(α)eiα/ΣP(α)| >, where α is the phase and P(α) is the phase probability distributiond Rwork = Σ||Fobs| – |Fcalc||/Σ|Fobs| and Rfree = Σ||Fobs| – |Fcalc||/Σ|Fobs|, where all of the reflections belong to a test set of 5% randomly selected data Open table in a new tab Analysis of Triple Helix Geometry—Helical parameters were calculated based on the method of Sugeta and Miyazawa (54Sugeta H.

https://openalex.org/W2043243100,"The RAF–mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2–extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (RAF–MEK1/2–ERK1/2) pathway is activated in many human tumours and can protect cells against growth factor deprivation; however, most such studies have relied upon overexpression of RAF or MEK constructs that are not found in tumours. Here we show that expression of the endogenous BRAFV600E allele in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from conditional knock-in transgenic mice activates ERK1/2, represses the BH3-only protein BIM and protects cells from growth factor withdrawal. Human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines harbouring BRAFV600E are growth factor independent for the activation of ERK1/2 and survival. However, treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126, PD184352 or the novel clinical candidate AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) overcomes growth factor independence, causing CRC cell death. BIM is de-phosphorylated and upregulated following MEK1/2 inhibition in all CRC cell lines studied and knockdown of BIM reduces cell death, indicating that repression of BIM is a major part of the ability of BRAFV600E to confer growth factor-independent survival. We conclude that a single endogenous BRAFV600E allele is sufficient to repress BIM and prevent death arising from growth factor withdrawal, and CRC cells with BRAFV600E mutations are addicted to the ERK1/2 pathway for repression of BIM and growth factor-independent survival."

Understanding the biophysical properties of antigen-antibody interactions is essential to comprehend the evolution of the adaptive immune response. Like other protein-protein associations, antigen-antibody complexes arise from noncovalent interactions, including electrostatic and van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic effects (1Janin J. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 2Mariuzza R.A. Poljak R.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A critical condition for Ab-Ag binding is the formation of a specific complex between the Ab and the Ag. Understanding the interaction of these two biological macromolecules requires detailed knowledge of the structure and functional characteristics of the complex. The structure of the Ab-Ag complex can be described using x-ray crystallography and computer-generated structural models. The functional activity can be described by the kinetic rate constants, equilibrium constants, and thermodynamic binding parameters of the complex. Historically, it was widely assumed that the antibody heavy constant (CH) domain determines Ab isotype without directly affecting Ag binding affinity and/or specificity. This concept dates to the discovery that when B cells switch from one CH region to another they maintain the same variable (V) regions, leading to the inference that the avidity and effector functions of an Ab change without altering the specificity for the antigen (3Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3177) Google Scholar). Hence, the classical view of Ab function was that of a bifunctional molecule with the V domains being solely responsible for Ab affinity and specificity, whereas the C region was responsible for the biological properties such as complement activation, Fc receptor binding, avidity, and serum half-life (4Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). However, in recent years this dogma has unraveled with the accumulation of new data, which suggest that the CH region can affect V region structure, thereby affecting Ab affinity and specificity (5Greenspan N.S.

Perhaps the strongest evidence for this effect comes from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies showing that V region-identical antibodies differing in C region manifest large differences in binding to univalent antigens (10Torres M. Fernandez-Fuentes N. Fiser A. Casadevall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13917-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Torres M. Fernandez-Fuentes N. Fiser A. Casadevall A. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Those results indicated kinetic and thermodynamic variations that implied diverse Ab-Ag interactions within IgG molecules expressing different CH regions but identical V regions. Although SPR is a very powerful and useful technique for studying protein-ligand interactions, this method is vulnerable to possible artifacts. For example, SPR measurements can be affected by mass transport effects, excluded volume effects, surface concentration, and the possibility that protein immobilization affects its affinity for antigen. Furthermore, interpretation of the SPR data required data analysis by fitting to binding models, which introduces additional uncertainty. Consequently, it is important to validate conclusions derived from SPR data by other techniques. In this work, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and a univalent peptide (P1) (Table 1) to investigate the thermodynamic binding properties of the GXM-binding mAb 3E5 (IgG3) and its IgG switch variants. These Abs have identical V regions but differ in their CH domains (10Torres M. Fernandez-Fuentes N. Fiser A. Casadevall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13917-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ITC simultaneously and directly determines the enthalpic and entropic contributions, as well as the binding constant and stoichiometry in solution. ITC revealed differences in the binding energetics of V region-identical mAbs differing in isotype for a peptide mimetic thus establishing the influence of the CH region in Ag-Ab binding interactions. The results have important implications for Ab engineering and for the use of therapeutic Abs of different isotype.TABLE 1Amino acid sequence of P1 and PA1PeptideSequenceP1SPNQHTPPWMLKPA1GLQYTPSWMLVG Open table in a new tab Monoclonal Antibodies and Peptides—GXM-binding mAb 3E5 (IgG3) was produced by a hybridoma isolated from a mouse immunized with a GXM-Tetanus Toxoid conjugate vaccine (14Casadevall A.

The IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b switch variants were generated in vitro by sib selection (15Spira G. Scharff M.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mAb 3E5 family shares identical VH and VL sequences (12Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All mAbs were purified by protein A or G affinity chromatography (Pierce) from hybridoma culture supernatants and were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. mAb concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Bradford protein measurements. All Abs were tested by PAGE to verify their integrity and correct molecular weight. The mAbs of the 3E5 family were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry at the Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to confirm the absence of mAb aggregates (12Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Peptide mimetic of GXM P1 (SPNQHTPPWMLK) (Table 1) (12Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was synthesized and biotinylated by the Rockefeller University Proteomics Resource Center. Isothermal Titration Microcalorimetry—ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC instrument from Microcal (Northampton, MA). Injections of 6 μl of peptide solution were added from a computer-controlled microsyringe at an interval of 4 min into the sample solution of antibody (cell volume = 1.43 ml) with stirring at 350 rpm. An example of an ITC experiment is shown in Fig. 1 for IgG2a binding to peptide P1 at 27 °C. The concentration range of the antibodies was 7–25 μm, and the peptide was 1–2 mm. Titrations were done at pH 7.2 using 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal, with ΔH (binding enthalpy kcal mol–1), Ka (association constant), and n (number of binding sites per monomer), as adjustable parameters. The quantity c = Ka Mt(0), where Mt(0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, is of importance in titration microcalorimetry (16Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandt J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with c values 1 < c < 200. The instrument was calibrated using the calibration kit containing RNase A and 2′-CMP supplied by the manufacturer. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the Gibbs free energy equation, ΔG =ΔH – TΔS =–RT lnKa, where ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding, respectively. T is the absolute temperature, and R = 1.98 cal mol–1 K–1. Our previous serological studies (8McLean G.R. Torres M. Elguezabal N. Nakouzi A. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1379-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) revealed that 3E5 IgG3 and its switch variants IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b possessed different fine specificities for GXM. Specificity differences among these variants with identical V domains reinforce the notion that the C region of an antibody plays important roles in determining its specificity. We studied the kinetics and thermodynamics of binding of a 12-mer peptide mimetic (P1) to these variants by employing SPR to examine whether quantitative data support this view (10Torres M. Fernandez-Fuentes N. Fiser A. Casadevall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13917-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This study shows that Ab switch variants with identical V domains bound to P1 with different kinetics and thermodynamics. Molecular modeling suggests that amino acid sequence polymorphisms in the CH region influence the secondary structure of the antigen-binding site leading to specificity differences (10Torres M. Fernandez-Fuentes N. Fiser A. Casadevall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13917-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the thermodynamic data determined by SPR are indirect and may be affected by certain experimental conditions and intrinsic limitations of the technique. Therefore, in this study, we used ITC to determine the thermodynamic binding parameters of 3E3 IgG3 and its switch variants IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2bfor P1. ITC can directly determine the association constant, stoichiometry, enthalpy, and entropy of binding in a single experiment. This method measures binding parameters in solution and is free of the limitations associated with solid phase binding techniques such as SPR. Peptide mimetics of GXM bind to the antigen-binding site of an antibody and are useful tools for determining the fine specificities of mAbs with identical V regions (Valadon et al. (24Valadon P. Nussbaum G. Boyd L.F. Margulies D.H. Scharff M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The present study was done with P1 (Table 1), a peptide mimetic of GXM representing a sequence isolated from the screening of peptide-expressing phage library with 3E5 IgG3. The phage expressing P1 showed differences in its binding reactivity with the 3E5 switch variants (12Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Binding Stoichiometry of the Antibodies for the Peptide P1—ITC can directly and unambiguously determine the number of binding site (n) of a macromolecule. The n values of mAb 3E5 and its switch variants range from 1.9 to 2.2 (Table 2). These values indicate that the antibodies possess two binding sites for the peptides, and each intact antibody molecule can bind to two molecules of P1, as would be expected for an IgG. The excellent correlation between the predicted and experimentally determined binding stoichiometries for the mAb 3E5 variants provides an important internal control for the high quality of the immunoglobulin preparations. Furthermore, the near-2.0 ratio of peptide to immunoglobulin molecule indicates that each V region is interacting with a single ligand, ruling out avidity effects. Anti-p24 (HIV-1) monoclonal antibody CB4-1 shows similar stoichiometry for four epitope-related and three library-derived peptides (17Welfle K. Misselwitz R. Hohne W. Welfle H. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Thermodynamic binding parameters of mAb 3E5 and its switch variants obtained with P1 at pH 7.4 and 27 °CAntibodyKa-ΔG-ΔH-TΔSnm-1 × 10-4kcal/molkcal/molkcal/molPeptide with biotin 3E5 IgG2a1908.68.1-0.51.93 3E5 IgG32808.88.5-0.32.04 3E5 IgG14409.17.5-1.61.98Biotin-free peptide 3E5 IgG2a1568.57.2-1.32.2 3E5 IgG13008.85.7-3.11.92 3E5 IgG33608.96.5-2.42.08 3E5 IgG2b2708.85.2-3.61.97 Open table in a new tab Peptide Binding Affinities of 3E5 and Its Switch Variants—ITC data show that the association constants Ka (affinity) of 3E5 IgG3 and its variants for P1 peptide are different (Table 2). The Ka (m–1) values of mAb 353 IgG3 and its switch variants IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b for nonbiotinylated P1 peptide were 360 × 104, 300 × 104, 156 × 104, and 270 × 104, respectively, at 27 °C. The Ka (m–1) values obtained with biotinylated P1 in similar conditions were 280 × 104 (3E5 IgG3), 440 × 104 (IgG1), and 190 × 104 (IgG2a). The affinities of the mAbs determined by ITC are greater than those previously determined by SPR, whereas the differences in the affinities of the individual isotypes are smaller in magnitude. Certain intrinsic limitations associated with SPR might have contributed to the underestimation of the affinities of the antibodies. Different antibodies show a range of Ka values for different peptides. For example, the affinities of the anti-p24 (HIV-1) mAb CB4-1 for a series of peptides vary from 5100 × 104m–1 to 14 × 104m–1 (17Welfle K. Misselwitz R. Hohne W. Welfle H. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Shigella flexneri Y O-antigen-specific antibody SYA/J6 binds to an octapeptide, a functional mimic of the O-antigen, with a Ka value of 25 × 104m–1. A constituent pentasaccharide of the O-antigen binds with comparable affinity to the same binding site of the antibody (18Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Chervenak M.C. Bundle D.R. Pinto B.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15023-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The functional oligosaccharide analog of P1 is unknown; therefore, we are unable to compare the affinity of the oligosaccharide epitope to that of its mimetic peptide P1. Furthermore, in contrasting the similarities and differences between SPR and ITC, it is noteworthy that the former method employed immobilized antibody binding to soluble peptide, whereas the latter measures the interaction of both entities in solution. Despite differences in the magnitude of effects measured by SPR and ITC, both techniques show that V region-identical antibodies manifest differences in the energetics of binding to a 12-mer peptide that must reflect subtle changes in Ag-Ab interactions imposed by isotype-related differences in CH1 domain sequences. Relative Contributions of Enthalpy and Entropy to the Binding Free Energy—Binding of P1 to all antibodies is associated with favorable entropy (TΔS = 1.3–3.6) and favorable enthalpy (ΔH =–5.2 to –7.2) (Table 2). The absolute values of ΔH and TΔS varied among the antibodies; however, the overall trends are comparable. The favorable entropic values indicate that the binding may be dominated by hydrophobic interactions and are consistent with the displacement of water molecules from the antibody-binding site and/or peptide hydration shell. The ΔH values in Table 2 suggest the formation of a modest number of hydrogen bonds in the P1-antibody complexes. As discussed below, insights from the crystal structure of the comparable mAb 2H1-peptide PA1 complex (19Young A.C.M. Valadon P. Casadevall A. Scharff M.D. Sacchettini J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) support these notions. The favorable entropic contribution in P1 binding is somewhat unique compared with some other antibody-peptide interactions. For example, in another system, binding of peptides to mAbs CB4-1 and SYA/J6 is mostly enthalpy-driven and is significantly compensated by unfavorable entropic effects (17Welfle K. Misselwitz R. Hohne W. Welfle H. J. Mol. Recognit. 2003; 16: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Chervenak M.C. Bundle D.R. Pinto B.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15023-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it is interesting to note that binding of a pentasaccharide and other oligosaccharides corresponding to O-polysaccharide to SYA/J6 is associated with favorable entropy (TΔS = 2.3–5.9), and hydrophobic interactions make significant contributions to binding (20Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Chervenak M.C. Johnson M.A. Pinto B.M. Bundle D.R. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13575-13586Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made in the binding of a trisaccharide epitope of a Salmonella O-antigen to mAb Se155-4 (21Sigurskjold B.W. Bundle D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8371-8376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insight from the Crystal Structure of mAb 2H1-PA1 Complex—We have previously solved the crystal structures of mAb 2H1 (another mAb to Cryptococcus neoformans polysaccharide) complexed with a 12-amino acid residue peptide PA1 (GLQYTPSWMLVG) (Table 1) (19Young A.C.M. Valadon P. Casadevall A. Scharff M.D. Sacchettini J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). mAb 2H1 is highly homologous (>90% sequence identity) with mAb 3E5, and the binding site residues of these two antibodies are highly conserved (10Torres M. Fernandez-Fuentes N. Fiser A. Casadevall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13917-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PA1 and P1 (SPNQHTPPWMLK) (Table 1) belong to a group of peptides that possess a common motif TPXW(M/L)(M/L). The presence of a common motif indicates that these residues are essential for binding the peptides to the antibody. Indeed, x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that PA1 interacts with mAb 2H1 through Thr, Pro, Trp, Met, and Leu (19Young A.C.M. Valadon P. Casadevall A. Scharff M.D. Sacchettini J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These residues are also present in the motif region of P1. Because mAbs 2H1 and 3E5 are highly homologous antibodies and PA1 and P1 possess a common motif, structural insights gained from 2H1-PA1 complex may help explain some of the thermodynamic binding data obtained with mAb 3E5 and P1. As observed in other linear peptides, PA1 contains some secondary structure. Because of the presence of a β-turn between SerP7 and LeuP10 of the peptide, the entire motif consisting of residues between ThrP5 and LeuP10 is compressed into a tight cluster that, in turn, places the motif residues deeply buried into the combining site of mAb 2H1. Because of its structural resemblance with PA1, P1 may show similar features that can facilitate its binding to mAb 3E5. The combining site of mAb 2H1 is essentially uncharged and is composed of residues from both the light (ValL94 and TrpL96) and heavy (PheH33, LeuH47, ThrH50, IleH51, AsnH52, LysH56, ThrH57, ArgH95, and LeuH100a) chains. In general, a β-turn maximizes the total buried surface area of a peptide bound to an antibody and results in a better fitting in the combining site (22Rini J.M. Schulze-Gahmen U. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 255: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The combining site of mAb 2H1 is predominantly hydrophobic in nature; therefore, peptides with bulky hydrophobic residues such as Trp and Met would most complementarily interact with the binding site. The β-turn containing TrpP8 and MetP9 is a crucial structure for the peptide to bind most efficiently to the antibody. Indeed, the residues of the peptide located within the β-turn that point into the binding site are highly conserved. In addition, two highly hydrophobic cavities are formed between MetP9 of the PA1 and PheH33, SerH35, Thr H50, ArgH95, ValL94, LeuH47, and TyrH58 of 2H1. P1 may potentially be involved in hydrophobic interactions with mAb 3E5 through the Trp and Met residues of the peptide. The favorable TΔS (entropy) values associated with P1 binding to mAb 3E5, and its switch variants strongly support this possibility. Hydrophobic interaction through Met and Trp residues of the peptide has also been reported for an octapeptide binding to mAb SYA/J6 (18Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Chervenak M.C. Bundle D.R. Pinto B.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15023-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Four residues of PA1 form six hydrogen bonds with mAb 2H1 of which four H-bonds are made by two motif residues namely ThrP5 and MetP9. H-bonding interactions of ThrP5 are comparable with those found in antibody-polysaccharide complexes (23Cygler M. Wu S. Zdanov A. Bundle D.R. Rose D.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All the higher affinity peptides possess Thr at position 5 (24Valadon P. Nussbaum G. Boyd L.F. Margulies D.H. Scharff M.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The Thr and Met of P1 can potentially form similar H-bonds with mAb 3E5. The modest ΔH values obtained with P1 (ΔH =–5.2 to –7.2) (Table 2) are consistent with the formation of a limited number of H-bonds between P1 and mAb 3E5. In contrast, the octapeptide is connected through 20 (6 direct and 14 water-mediated) H-bonds to SYA/J6 Fab resulting in a higher negative binding enthalpy (ΔH = –16.9 kcal·mol–1) (18Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Chervenak M.C. Bundle D.R. Pinto B.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15023-15028Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Effect of Peptide Biotinylation on Binding Thermodynamics—Experimental techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that assay antibody-binding properties often use biotinylated ligands to immobilize antigens on solid surfaces. For example, we have previously used biotinylated peptides to assay their antibody binding activities (12Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We wanted to examine how the biotin molecules attached to peptides (in this particular case P1) influenced the affinity and other binding properties. Interestingly, all biotinylated P1 peptides tested in this study showed higher ΔH values compared with corresponding biotin-free P1 (ΔΔH =–0.9 to –2.0) (Table 2). The higher ΔH values probably resulted from additional hydrogen bonding through the biotin molecules. However, this enthalpic gain was compensated by unfavorable entropic effect. As a result, the biotinylated P1 did not show any significant changes in affinity compared with biotin-free P1. Enthalpy-Entropy Compensation—Enthalpy-entropy compensation plots have been observed previously during carbohydrate binding to lectins (25Schwarz F.P. Puri K.D. Bhat R.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7668-7677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lemieux R.U. Delbaere L.T.J. Beierbeck H. Spohr U. CIBA Found. Symp. 1991; 158: 231-248PubMed Google Scholar) and antibodies (21Sigurskjold B.W. Bundle D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8371-8376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Herrons J.N.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and are attributed to the unique properties of water (26Lemieux R.U. Delbaere L.T.J. Beierbeck H. Spohr U. CIBA Found. Symp. 1991; 158: 231-248PubMed Google Scholar). A change in binding enthalpy is always compensated by the change of binding entropy. When an enthalpic interaction such as a hydrogen bond or a salt bridge is lost, motional freedom increases. As a result, a certain amount of entropy is gained. On the other hand, when new bonds are formed (enthalpic gain) motional freedom is restricted (loss of entropy). When binding interactions occur in aqueous solution, solvent displacement plays a major role in enthalpy-entropy compensation. Water molecules bind to the surface, especially the hydrophobic surface of the solutes (such as the binding sites of a protein and its ligands) through hydrogen bonds resulting in enthalpic gain. When ligand binds to the combining site of a protein, these surface-bound water molecules are stripped off, and a certain amount of enthalpy is lost. This loss is compensated by favorable entropy. When a group of ligands interact with their receptors through the same mechanism, the enthalpy and entropy show a linear relationship (28Brummell D.A. Sharma V.P. Anand N.N. Bilous D. Dubuc G. Michniewicz J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Sigurskjold B.W. Sinnott B. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A plot of the –ΔH versus –TΔS values at 300 K for P1 binding to the mAbs in Table 2 shows that it is also compensatory (Fig. 2). The plot shows a linear relationship with a slope of 0.87 and the correlation coefficient of 0.98 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the enthalpy-entropy plot in Fig. 2 is similar to those reported earlier for other antibody-carbohydrate interactions in that their slopes are less than unity (21Sigurskjold B.W. Bundle D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8371-8376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Brummell D.A. Sharma V.P. Anand N.N. Bilous D. Dubuc G. Michniewicz J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Sigurskjold B.W. Sinnott B. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), in contrast to lectin-carbohydrate interactions where the slope is often greater than unity (29Munske G.R. Krakauer H. Magnuson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Lemieux R.U. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1989; 18: 347-374Crossref Google Scholar). A slope greater than unity means that the free energy of binding is predominantly driven by enthalpy, whereas a slope less than unity indicates dominant entropy contributions. The slope value of the enthalpy-entropy compensation plot indicates that the binding of P1 to mAb 3E5 and its switch variants is dominated by entropy. When the data obtained with biotinylated P1 were included (Fig. 2B), the slope value increased from 0.87 to 0.95 because of the relatively higher –ΔH values of the biotinylated peptide P1. However, the value is still less than unity. mAb 3E5 and Its Switch Variants Possess Different Binding Thermodynamics for P1—ITC data in Table 2 reveal that the C region of the antibodies significantly contributes to their binding thermodynamics. Despite having identical V domains, the enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (TΔS) of binding of 3E3 IgG3, and its variants IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b are very different for P1. The range of ΔH was –5.2 to –7.2, whereas TΔS ranged from 1.3 to 3.6 (Table 2). Thermodynamics of lectin-carbohydrate interactions have been reported to be influenced by the alteration of amino acids that are located far away from the binding site (31Gupta D. Cho M. Cummings R.D. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15236-15243Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling revealed that there are three regions of minor structural differences within the CH1 domain of 3E5 IgG isotypes (10Torres M. Fernandez-Fuentes N. Fiser A. Casadevall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13917-13927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues in these regions of different isotypes may be engaged in differential electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with other interchain residues and solvent molecules that, in turn, could influence the structure and the microenvironment of the combining site of the antibody. The minor structural differences shown by homology modeling may not be detectable by x-ray crystallography. However, our findings establish that these minor differences can alter the binding thermodynamics of the isotypes, which are in turn detectable by ITC. Hence, ITC provides unambiguous thermodynamic evidence for differences in Ag-Ab interactions caused by constant region contributions."

Oncol. 2001; 28: 67-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The classical pathway of activation of the EGFR occurs through binding of a ligand to its extracellular domain and subsequent autophosphorylation of two receptor molecules (4Schlesinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3455) Google Scholar). Ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) are synthesized as membrane-spanning molecules that are proteolytically cleaved to become active. Ligand binding initiates the formation of activated dimers/oligomers that undergo autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail. This serves as the trigger for the recruitment of adaptor proteins and the initiation of signaling cascades within the cell. Mutations of EGFR, such as deletion of 801 bp encoded by exons 2–7 (5Sugawa N. Ekstrand A.J. James C.D. Collins V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The paradigm for transactivation of EGFR has been the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated pathway (8Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). GPCR-dependent activation of matrix metalloproteases leads to cleavage of pro-HB-EGF and release of the mature growth factor, which then goes on to activate the EGFR (9Fischer O.M. Hart S.

Helicobacter pylori is the causative agent of superficial gastritis, and infection with H. pylori increases the risk of adenocarcinoma of the stomach (12Parsonnet J. Friedman G.D. Vandersteen D.P.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key factor regulating host angiogenesis in H. pylori-linked gastric malignancy (13Caputo R. Tuccillo C. Manzo B.A. Zarrilli R. Tortora G. Blanco Cdel V.

However, the underlying mechanisms regulating the induction of VEGF by H. pylori are incompletely understood. Soluble, secreted factors of H. pylori, such as CagA, VacA, and BabA, have been reported to elicit a variety of host molecules involved in remodeling of the gastric epithelium (15Romano M. Ricci V. Zarrilli R. Nat. Clin. Practice Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2006; 3: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Signaling through the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases regulates production of VEGF (16Eriksson U. Alitalo K. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 237: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Reports have documented the role of H. pylori in transactivation of the EGFR (17Keates S. Sougioultzis S. Keates A.C. Zhao D.

Here we demonstrate an unexpected role of a secreted Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-interacting protein HP0175 of H. pylori in effecting TLR4-dependent transactivation of the EGFR, leading to production of VEGF. The activation of EGFR does not involve the classical metalloprotease-dependent transactivation involving the shedding of HB-EGF or autocrine/paracrine EGF-mediated activation of EGFR. Our results brings to light a novel element of the cellular receptor cross-talk network. Reagents—Anti-EGFR, anti-phosphotyrosine, and EGF were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against Lyn, TLR4, and protein A/G (plus)-agarose, Lyn siRNA, EGFR siRNA, and control siRNA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-flotillin was from BD Biosciences; neutralizing TLR4 antibody was from Imgenex (Bhubaneswar, India); the tyrosine kinase peptide substrate Raytide, LFM-A13, AG1478, GM6001, NS398, PP2, piceatannol, and protease inhibitors were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA); and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD), luciferin, anti-FLAG antibody, and M2-FLAG-agarose were from Sigma. Fugene 6 and anti-Myc antibodies were from Roche Applied Science, and neutralizing EGF and HB-EGF antibody were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Plasmids—TLR4 and its dominant-negative mutant (encoding amino acids 1–643) lacking the TIR domain have been described (18Basak C. Pathak S.K. Bhattacharyya A. Mandal D. Pathak S. Kundu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4279-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutants of hTLR4 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis based on the principle of overlap extension PCR using pEF-BOS-TLR4 as template. The first round of PCR was performed with primer pairs a and b for one reaction and primer pairs c and d for the second reaction. The second round of PCR was performed using the products of the first round as templates, and primers a and d. Primers b and c are depicted in supplemental Table S1. Primers a and d were 5′-GATCTCGAGAAAACCAGTGAGGATGATGC-3′ and 5′-GATGGATCCGATAGATGTTGCTTCCTGCC-3′, respectively. The final products were cloned between the XhoI and BamHI sites of pEF-BOS. Cell Culture and Infections—The human gastric epithelial cell line AGS was obtained from the National Centre of Cell Science (Pune, India) and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transfections were routinely carried out using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HP0175 was purified as described earlier (19Basak C. Pathak S.K. Bhattacharyya A. Pathak S. Basu J. Kundu M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5672-5680Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). H. pylori strains were grown as described (19Basak C. Pathak S.K. Bhattacharyya A. Pathak S. Basu J. Kundu M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5672-5680Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and incubated with AGS or HEK293 cells at a multiplicity of infection 50–100 on culture plates. Strains 80A and 18A were cag– and cag+ clinical isolates, respectively, obtained from the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata. These strains have been described previously (20Bhattacharyya A. Pathak S. Datta S. Chattopadhyay S. Basu J. Kundu M. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). VEGF Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Cells (0.3 × 105/assay) were seeded into 96-well plates. After treatments, culture supernatants were collected and assayed for VEGF using the VEGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from AGS cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 100 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using the Titanium One-Step reverse transcription-PCR kit (BD Biosciences). The primers 5′-CTGCTGTCTTGGGTGCATTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCACATTTGTTGTGCTGTAG-3′ (antisense) were used to amplify 378 bp of vegf mRNA. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified using the primers 5′-CCA TCA ATG ACC CCT TCA TTG ACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAA GGC CAT GCC AGT GAG CTT CC-3′ (antisense) to generate a 604-bp product. The PCR conditions for vegf mRNA were denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. Luciferase Reporter Assay—The vegf promoter (−2018 to +50) was amplified by PCR using the primer pair 5′-ATAGGTACCTCTACAGCTTGTGCTCCT-3′ (sense), and 5′-ATAAAGCTTCCCCCAGCGCCACGACCT-3′ (antisense). The product was cloned into the vector pGL2 Basic (Promega) harboring the promoterless luciferase gene, using asymmetric KpnI and HindIII sites (underlined). AGS cells (2 × 105/assay) were transfected with the luciferase reporter construct along with β-galactosidase construct using Fugene 6. Transfected cells after treatment were lysed in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and centrifuged, and the supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity using luciferin as substrate. EGFR and Lyn Kinase Assays—Cells after treatment were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 40 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation. For EGFR kinase assays, EGFR was immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer A and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 3 mm NaCl, 2 mm MnCl2, 24 μm EDTA, 50 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.15 μm β-mercaptoethanol). Beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 ng of the synthetic peptide RLIEDNEYTARG (sc-3049; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (20 Ci/mmol). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the incorporation of phosphates in the peptide was determined by spotting on p81 phosphocellulose paper. Lyn kinase assays were similarly performed using the peptide substrate Raytide. Study of the Interaction of TLR4 with EGFR—Cells were transfected with FLAG-TLR4 (or its mutants). After treatments, cells were lysed in buffer A, followed by clarification of the supernatant by centrifugation and incubation with anti-FLAG antibody (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was subsequently added and kept for another 3 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled in Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-EGFR antibody to detect coimmunoprecipitated EGFR. Analysis of Tyrosine Phosphorylation of TLR4—AGS cells were transfected with FLAG-TLR4 constructs as described above. After treatments, cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and immunoblotted using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Transfection of Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—Cells were transfected with EGFR or Lyn or control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Silencing of either EGFR or Lyn kinase was confirmed by Western blotting of cell lysates with anti-EGFR or anti-Lyn antibody. Isolation of Lipid Rafts and Western Analysis—AGS cells (2 × 106/assay) after treatment were lysed at 4 °C in 1.5 ml of TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm EDTA and subjected to a sucrose flotation gradient. After 30 min at 4 °C, the extract was mixed with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose, overlaid with 30% (w/v) sucrose and 5% sucrose, and subjected to ultracentrifugation in an AH-629 rotor (Sorvall) at 27,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C. Fractions were collected as described (21Mandal D. Mazumder A. Das P. Kundu M. Basu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39460-39467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-EGFR or anti-TLR4 or anti-flotillin antibody, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and subjected to analysis by Western blotting using the same antibodies. HP0175 Induces VEGF Production in Gastric Epithelial Cells—In our effort to define in detail the repertoire of molecules responsible for VEGF expression, we tested the effect of HP0175, a soluble TLR4-interacting protein previously characterized by us (19Basak C. Pathak S.K. Bhattacharyya A. Pathak S. Basu J. Kundu M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5672-5680Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, recombinant HP0175 purified from Escherichia coli was used for all studies. Here we show that exogenous HP0175 stimulates VEGF release from AGS cells. The HP0175-induced release of VEGF was time- and concentration-dependent (Fig. 1, A and B). Recombinant HP0175 purified from HEK293 cells also induced VEGF production (Fig. 1B, last bar), ruling out the possibility that endotoxin contamination was responsible for the observed effect of the recombinant protein. VacA has been identified as one of the soluble factors of H. pylori responsible for VEGF release from epithelial cells (13Caputo R. Tuccillo C. Manzo B.A. Zarrilli R. Tortora G. Blanco Cdel V. Ricc V. Ciardiello F. Romano M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2015-2021PubMed Google Scholar). HP0175-mediated release of VEGF was comparable with that elicited by VacA (data not shown). The role of HP0175 was supported by the observation that an isogenic strain inactivated in hp0175 showed significantly reduced VEGF-inducing ability, which was restored upon complementation with the hp0175 gene (Fig. 1C). HP0175 induced vegf transcription and activated VEGF promoter-driven luciferase expression in a time-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B, respectively). VEGF promoter-driven luciferase expression was diminished in a mutant inactivated in hp0175 (Fig. 1D) and restored upon complementation with hp0175, supporting the notion that HP0175 is an important bacterial factor that elicits vegf production in H. pylori-challenged gastric epithelial cells. HP0175-mediated VEGF Production Is Dependent on TLR4 and EGFR—We next attempted to delineate the signaling events associated with exogenous HP0175-mediated production of VEGF. Taking into account the fact that HP0175 interacts with TLR4, we tested the role of TLR4 in HP0175-dependent VEGF production. Treatment of AGS cells with neutralizing antibodies against TLR4 inhibited HP0175-induced VEGF release (Fig. 1E). However, VacA-mediated VEGF release from AGS cells occurred in a TLR4-independent manner (data not shown). Cells transfected with dominant negative TLR4 also showed attenuation of HP0175-induced vegf promoter-driven luciferase expression (Fig. 1F). This suggested a role of TLR4 in VEGF production in this instance. In view of the fact that VEGF production is associated with activation of EGFR (13Caputo R. Tuccillo C. Manzo B.A. Zarrilli R. Tortora G. Blanco Cdel V. Ricc V. Ciardiello F. Romano M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2015-2021PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the possible involvement of EGFR in HP0175-induced VEGF production. Knockdown of EGFR by RNA interference (supplemental Fig. S1C) attenuated HP0175-driven VEGF production (Fig. 1G) and VEGF promoter-driven luciferase activation (Fig. 1H). HP0175 Activates EGFR in a Metalloproteinase-independent Manner—The observation that both TLR4 and EGFR were involved in HP0175-driven VEGF production, provided the motivation to test the possibility that cross-talk between TLR4 and EGFR leads to activation of EGFR. This is the focus of the present report. Considering that HP0175-mediated VEGF production was dependent on EGFR, we tested whether exogenous HP0175 activates EGFR in AGS cells. HP0175 activated EGFR in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Activation of EGFR was inhibited by the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (Fig. 2B). HP0175 purified from HEK293 cells also activated EGFR (Fig. 2A). A previous report (17Keates S. Sougioultzis S. Keates A.C. Zhao D. Peek Jr., R.M. Shaw L.M. Kelly C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48127-48134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) has suggested that shedding of HB-EGF by the action of matrix metalloproteinases is linked to H. pylori-mediated activation of EGFR. We therefore tested whether HP0175 was activating such a pathway. Neither neutralizing HB-EGF antibody (Fig. 2A) nor GM6001 (batimastat, a metalloproteinase inhibitor) (Fig. 2B) inhibited HP0175-driven activation of EGFR. As a control, neutralizing HB-EGF antibody was capable of inhibiting HB-EGF-elicited EGFR kinase activity (supplemental Fig. S1D). As expected, HP0175-induced VEGF production was also not inhibited (data not shown). Neutralizing EGF antibody did not inhibit HP0175-induced VEGF release, whereas EGF-induced VEGF release was inhibited by this antibody (supplemental Fig. S1E). This suggested the likelihood of HP0175 inducing a novel transactivation mechanism. The ability of the intact bacterium to activate EGFR was diminished in a mutant inactivated in hp0175 (supplemental Fig. S1F) and restored upon complementation with hp0175. EGFR kinase activation by H. pylori was abrogated when AGS cells were pretreated with neutralizing TLR4 antibody but not when cells were pretreated with neutralizing HB-EGF antibody or with GM6001 (supplemental Fig. S1F). These results provided support to the view that TLR4-dependent transactivation of EGFR plays an important role in H. pylori-induced signaling in gastric epithelial cells. HP0175 Drives the Interaction between TLR4 and EGFR and Activation of EGFR—Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed to determine whether HP0175 treatment of AGS cells triggered interaction of EGFR with TLR4. EGFR was detected in lysates of HP0175-stimulated FLAG-TLR4-transfected AGS cells captured with FLAG antibody but not in control lysates (Fig. 2C) or in cells stimulated with an irrelevant His-tagged protein (data not shown). HP0175 expressed in HEK293 cells was also found to stimulate the interaction of TLR4 with EGFR (data not shown). HEK293 cells are naturally TLR4- and TLR2-negative. Expression of TLR4 led to activation of EGFR kinase in a time-dependent manner in response to challenge with HP1075 (Fig. 2D). TLR2-transfected HEK293 cells did not show EGFR kinase activation in response to HP0175 (Fig. 2D), indicating the specificity of the observed effects. Lipopolysaccharide, a TLR4 ligand, was unable to induce EGFR kinase activity or VEGF release from AGS cells (Fig. 2A, last bar), indicating that the effect was specific for HP0175. HP0175 Signaling Triggers Activation of Lyn Kinase—Activation of EGFR involves Src-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR (4Schlesinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3455) Google Scholar). Among the members of the Src family, AGS cells express c-Src and Lyn (22Stein M. Bagnoli F. Halenbeck R. Rappuoli R. Fantl W.J. Covacci A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We evaluated the role of Src family kinases in HP0175-driven signaling events by measuring HP0175-mediated VEGF release and EGFR kinase activation. Both VEGF promoter-driven luciferase activation (supplemental Fig. S1B) and EGFR kinase activation (Fig. 3A) were inhibited by pretreatment with the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2. Knockdown of Lyn kinase by RNA interference (supplemental Fig. S1G), inhibited HP0175-induced VEGF promoter-driven luciferase (Fig. 3B) as well as EGFR activation (Fig. 3C). HP0175-driven phosphorylation of Lyn on tyrosine residues occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). However, Lyn kinase was not affected by knockdown of EGFR (supplemental Fig. S2A). HP0175-induced Lyn kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn were inhibited in AGS cells transfected with dominant negative TLR4 (Fig. 3, E and F, respectively) and Lyn kinase activity was inhibited in cells pretreated with neutralizing antibodies against TLR4 (supplemental Fig. S2B), arguing in favor of an essential role of TLR4 in Lyn activation. It therefore appeared that the binding of HP0175 to TLR4 facilitates binding of Lyn to its intracellular domain and subsequent activation of Lyn. In monocytic cells, the tyrosine kinase Syk has been reported to associate with TLR4 (23Chaudhary A. Fresquez T.M. Naranjo M.J. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We did not observe association of Syk with TLR4 after treatment of AGS cells with HP0175 (data not shown). The ability of the intact bacterium to activate Lyn kinase was diminished in a mutant inactivated in hp0175 and restored upon complementation with hp0175 (supplemental Fig. S3A). Lyn Kinase Phosphorylates TLR4—TLR4 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues has been reported to be involved in TLR4-dependent signaling events (24Medvedev A.E. Piao W. Shoenfelt J. Rhee S.H. Chen H. Basu S. Wahl L.M. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16042-16053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). HP0175 induced TLR4 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). The Src kinase inhibitor PP2 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR4 in HP0175-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Knocking down of Lyn using Lyn-specific siRNA abrogated the tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR4 (Fig. 4B) and its interaction with EGFR (supplemental Fig. S3B). Pretreatment of cells with piceatannol, an inhibitor of Syk kinase or with LFM-A13, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR4 (data not shown). Neither LFM-A13 nor piceatannol affected HP0175-induced EGFR kinase activation (Fig. 2B). Tyr674 and Tyr680 have been identified as phosphorylatable tyrosine residues of TLR4 (24Medvedev A.E. Piao W. Shoenfelt J. Rhee S.H. Chen H. Basu S. Wahl L.M. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16042-16053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), whereas Pro714 is crucial for signaling downstream of TLR4. Mutation of either Tyr674 or Tyr680 or both led to partial inhibition of HP0175-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR4, whereas the P714A mutation showed complete inhibition of TLR4 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that as in the case of lipopolysaccharide signaling, these residues were probably important in HP0175-mediated signaling events. The role of HP0175 in mediating H. pylori-induced TLR4 tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed by challenging AGS cells with bacteria inactivated in hp0175. Tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR4 and its interaction with EGFR were abrogated in the knock-out strain but restored upon complementation with hp0175 (supplemental Fig. S4, A and C). Although HP0175 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR4 in AGS cells, VacA, which like HP0175, elicits VEGF release, did not do so (supplemental Fig. S4B). We tested interaction of TLR4 with Lyn in response to treatment of AGS cells transfected with different FLAG-tagged constructs of TLR4. Lyn could be coimmunoprecipitated with TLR4 (Fig. 4D). This interaction was not affected in cells transfected with tyrosine phosphorylation-defective mutants of TLR4 (Fig. 4D), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR4 is not necessary for its interaction with Lyn. Phosphorylation of TLR4 Is Required for EGFR Transactivation—In order to explore the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR4 in its interaction with EGFR, AGS cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged TLR4 (P714A) (which is defective in tyrosine phosphorylation), challenged with HP0175, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG and probing of the immunoprecipitates with anti-EGFR antibody. Interaction of TLR4 with EGFR was compromised in the Tyr674 or Tyr680 or the Tyr674/Tyr680 mutants. On the other hand, it was negligible for the P714A mutant (Fig. 2C). Tyrosine phosphorylation of TLR4 therefore appeared to be a prerequisite for its interaction with EGFR. Consistent with these observations, EGFR kinase activity was attenuated in cells transfected with the aforesaid mutant of TLR4 (Fig. 4E) as well as after knockdown of Lyn kinase by RNA interference (supplemental Fig. S1H). HP0175 Induces Translocation of TLR4 into Rafts—Translocation of signaling receptors to lipid rafts is a well documented event governing spatiotemporal control of signaling events (25Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 131-139Crossref Scopus (5058) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of AGS cells with MBCD, which specifically depletes cholesterol and disrupts lipid raft organization, led to an abrogation of HP0175-induced VEGF promoter-driven luciferase production (supplemental Fig. S1B), suggesting a role of lipid rafts in the signaling events triggered by HP0175. We observed that a fraction of EGFR is constitutively present in lipid rafts of AGS cells (Fig. 5A), an observation made in Chinese hamster ovary cells as well (26Pike L.J. Han X. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26796-26804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TLR4 translocated into rafts in a time-dependent manner after challenge with HP0175 (Fig. 5A"
https://openalex.org/W2133651949,"Growth factor independent-1 (Gfi1) is a zinc finger protein with a SNAG-transcriptional repressor domain. Ajuba is a LIM domain protein that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Ajuba functions as a co-repressor for synthetic Gfi1 SNAG-repressor domain-containing constructs, but a role for Ajuba co-repression of the cognate DNA bound Gfi1 protein has not been defined. Co-immunoprecipitation of synthetic and endogenous proteins and co-elution with gel filtration suggest that an endogenous Ajuba·Gfi1·HDAC multiprotein complex is possible. Active histone deacetylase activity co-immunoprecipitates with Ajuba or Gfi1, and both proteins depend upon histone deacetylases for full transcriptional repression activity. Ajuba LIM domains directly bind to Gfi1, but the association is not SNAG domain-dependent. ChIP analysis and reciprocal knockdown experiments suggest that Ajuba selectively functions as a co-repressor for Gfi1 autoregulation. The data suggest that Ajuba is utilized as a corepressor selectively on Gfi1 target genes. Growth factor independent-1 (Gfi1) is a zinc finger protein with a SNAG-transcriptional repressor domain. Ajuba is a LIM domain protein that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Ajuba functions as a co-repressor for synthetic Gfi1 SNAG-repressor domain-containing constructs, but a role for Ajuba co-repression of the cognate DNA bound Gfi1 protein has not been defined. Co-immunoprecipitation of synthetic and endogenous proteins and co-elution with gel filtration suggest that an endogenous Ajuba·Gfi1·HDAC multiprotein complex is possible. Active histone deacetylase activity co-immunoprecipitates with Ajuba or Gfi1, and both proteins depend upon histone deacetylases for full transcriptional repression activity. Ajuba LIM domains directly bind to Gfi1, but the association is not SNAG domain-dependent. ChIP analysis and reciprocal knockdown experiments suggest that Ajuba selectively functions as a co-repressor for Gfi1 autoregulation. The data suggest that Ajuba is utilized as a corepressor selectively on Gfi1 target genes. Group III LIM domain proteins, which have three to four tandem LIM domains at the C terminus, are involved in intracellular shuttling of interacting proteins. This suggests that these proteins may be involved in assembling multiple protein complexes with a wide range of functions such as cell development, differentiation, and signaling in different cellular compartments (for review see Refs. 1Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 2Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R.

The group III LIM protein family includes two subfamilies of proteins, which shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus: Ajuba (Jub), LIMD1, WTIP, and Zyxin, LPP, and Trip6 (4Goyal R.K. Lin P.

In the cytoplasm and at sites of cell adhesion, group-III LIM proteins function as adapter proteins in signal transduction (1Bach I. Mech.

Kanungo J. Payne A.S. Muslin A.J. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the nucleus, group III LIM proteins are suggested to regulate transcription. Specifically, the Trip6 protein functions as a transcriptional co-activator for the REL oncoprotein (10Wang Y. Gilmore T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, whereas nuclear Ajuba was shown to interact with the TTF1 transcription factor, the Ajuba and TTF1 interaction did not influence TTF1 transcriptional activity (11Missero C. Pirro M.T.

Gfi1 regulates genes involved in hemato-poietic stem cell maintenance, and myelopoiesis (reviewed in Ref. 13Kazanjian A. Gross E.A. Grimes H.L. Crit. Rev.

Gfi1 target genes include GFI1, GFI1B (15Doan L.L. Porter S.D. Duan Z. Flubacher M.M. Montoya D. Tsichlis P.N. Horwitz M. Gilks C.B. Grimes H.L.

Gfi1 contains six C2-H2 zinc fingers that bind to the core DNA sequence 5′-TAAATCAC(A/T)GCA-3′ (18Zweidler-Mckay P. Grimes H. Flubacher M. Tsichlis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4024-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 20 amino acids of GFI1 encode a transferable repressor domain termed “SNAG,” because it is conserved between SNAIL and GFI1-related proteins (19Grimes H. Chan T. Zweidler-McKay P. Tong B. Tsichlis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A yeast two-hybrid assay with the GFI1 SNAG domain identified Ajuba as an interacting protein (20Ayyanathan K. Peng H. Hou Z. Fredericks W.J. Goyal R.K. Langer E.M. Longmore G.D. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9097-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Synthetic constructs in which the Gfi1 SNAG domain was fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain suggested that Ajuba functions as a co-repressor for Gfi1 (20Ayyanathan K. Peng H. Hou Z. Fredericks W.J. Goyal R.K. Langer E.M. Longmore G.D. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9097-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); however, analysis of the cognate DNA-bound Gfi1 protein was not performed, leaving open the question of Ajuba as a co-repressor for Gfi1. Here we show that Ajuba functions as an HDAC-dependent co-repressor for a subset of Gfi1 target genes. Specifically, Ajuba functionally mediates GFI1 autoregulation. Cell Culture—EL4.IL-2 T cells (ATCC TIB-181) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% horse serum, 1% l-Gln, 1% Pen/Strep (Invitrogen). Jurkat T cells (clone E6-1, ATCC TIB-152) and human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL60, ATCC CCL-240) were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-Gln, 1% Pen/Strep (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, and Phoenix cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-Gln, 1% Pen/Strep (Invitrogen). All cell lines were kept at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Plasmids and Subcloning—Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter constructs and Gfi1 expression plasmids used in transient transcription assays were described previously (15Doan L.L. Porter S.D. Duan Z. Flubacher M.M. Montoya D. Tsichlis P.N. Horwitz M. Gilks C.B. Grimes H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2508-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Grimes H. Chan T. Zweidler-McKay P. Tong B. Tsichlis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Luciferase versions were generated by cloning the B30 × 2TK promoter and TK promoter fragments into the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). MIEV-Gfi1-FLAG retroviral construct was generated by digesting CMV14-Gfi1-FLAG with XhoI to release the Gfi1-FLAG fragment. The Gfi1-FLAG insert was subcloned into SalI/XhoI-digested pMIEV. Plasmids were sequenced and screened by restriction endonucleases to corroborate the proper sequence and orientation of the insert. To generate the LexA-Ajuba expression vector and their mutants LexA-LIM and LexA-PreLIM we first PCR-amplified LexA with primers (5′-AGAATTCAACAGCCAGTCGCCGTTGCG-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCTTACCATGAAAGCGTTAACGGCC-3′) and subcloned it into the TOPO vector by blunt-end ligation generating the vector LexA-TOPO. Next, EcoRI/HindIII digestion released a LexA insert, which was agarose-purified and subcloned into EcoRI/HindIII-linearized pCS2 (4Goyal R.K. Lin P. Kanungo J. Payne A.S. Muslin A.J. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate the plasmid pCS2-LexA. Finally, pCS2-Ajuba (4Goyal R.K. Lin P. Kanungo J. Payne A.S. Muslin A.J. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI to release the cDNA for Ajuba, which was ligated into the EcoRI-linearized pCS2-LexA. The mutant pCS2-LexA-LIM was generated by the same strategy. To generate LexA-PreLIM, the vector pCS2-LexA-Ajuba was digested with StuI, and the agarose-purified vector band was self-ligated. Plasmids were sequenced and digested with restriction endonucleases to corroborate the correct orientation of the products. Transient Transcription Assays—For transient transfections, 1.5 × 105 HEK 293T cells were plated on 24-well plates and transfected for 36 h with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Electroporation of EL4 cells was carried out with 20 μg of DNA, in 0.45-μm cuvettes (Bio-Rad), and 106 cells in 250 μl of media. Settings for pulses were 960 microfarads and 270 mV. Cells were cultured for 36 h before harvest. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay was performed as previously described, utilizing a Gfi1-insensitive mutant of a cytomegalovirus-immediate-early promoter-driven β-galactosidase vector as a transfection efficiency control (19Grimes H. Chan T. Zweidler-McKay P. Tong B. Tsichlis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Cellular extracts were adjusted for equivalent β-galactosidase activity, then analyzed by the scintillation method for CAT activity (19Grimes H. Chan T. Zweidler-McKay P. Tong B. Tsichlis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Luciferase assay transfections were controlled by co-transfection of a Gfi1-insensitive Renilla luciferase vector (Promega). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured consecutively with Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay reagents (Promega) using Lumat LB 9507 (Berthold Technologies). A t statistic was calculated on the difference between the values of each measurement of CAT or Firefly luciferase activity to determine statistical significance for -fold repression. All assays shown were repeated at least three times with similar results unless other-wise stated. Retroviral Transduction—Phoenix-Ampho cells were transiently transfected with retroviral constructs using the CaPO4 method, then co-cultured with Jurkat cells at 33 °C for 16 h. GFP+ cells were sorted 1 week after transduction, and single cell clones were obtained by limiting dilution. Clonal populations were analyzed for the presence of the FLAG-tagged proteins. Commercially available vectors were purchased for Gfi1 or Ajuba knockdown (Sigma). Lentiviral stocks were generated by three plasmid packaging in HEK 293 cells, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and tittered on MEL cells. HL60 cells were transduced with non-targeting and Gfi1- or Ajuba-targeting shRNA viruses at an multiplicity of infection of 5. The transduced cells were cultured in RPMI media with 10% fetal bovine serum and puromycin (5 μg/ml). Immunoblots and Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modified procedure of Dignam (21Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen), trypsinized, and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm Complete inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubating 10 min on ice, cells were transferred into a glass Dounce homogenizer and processed for 30-40 strokes with pestle A. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Cytoplasmic extract was transferred to a clean tube and snap-frozen. The nuclei were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Complete inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), transferred into a glass Dounce homogenizer. Nuclear extract was prepared by processing with pestle B until the pellet was totally dispersed, then centrifuged for 10-min centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C to pellet nuclear debris. For knockdown experiments, HL60 cell lysate was prepared using CompleteM lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce), and 20 μg of protein extract was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% Carnation instant milk in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 16 h. The blocked membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in 5% milk in TTBS (0.05% Tween 20 in TBS) between 1 and 4 h at room temperature. Gfi1 was detected using goat polyclonal N-20 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse monoclonal (2.5D17) (22Kazanjian A. Wallis D. Au N. Nigam R. Venken K.J. Cagle P.T. Dickey B.F. Bellen H.J. Gilks C.B. Grimes H.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6874-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) antibody. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against the histone deacetylases HDAC1 (Upstate Biotechnologies), HDAC2 (H-54, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HDAC3 (Upstate Biotechnologies), Ajuba (Cell Signaling), and a FLAG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (Sigma) were utilized according to the manufacturer's directions. The secondary antibodies were donkey anti-goat HRP-conjugated IgG (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Sheep anti-mouse Ig-HRP (1:2500) and donkey anti-rabbit Ig-HRP (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences). Secondary antibodies were prepared in 5% milk TTBS and incubated with blots for 1 h at room temperature. The detection was performed with ECL-plus detection reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For each immunoprecipitation, 200 μg of nuclear extracts was diluted to 150 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol. Extracts were precleared with a mix of protein A/G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h under gentle rocking, then 15 μl of antisera was added, and the immunocomplexes were allowed to form for 1 h at 4 °C. To capture the immunocomplexes, 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads were added for 16 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted at 2000 rpm for 5 min and washed five times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Samples were resuspended in 20 μl of 1× loading buffer, boiled for 10 min, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Isotype-matched-control immunoglobulin was used as a control for the immunoprecipitations. FLAG and Myc-specific immunoprecipitations were carried out with M2 affinity resin (Sigma) and Myc-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, following the manufacturer's directions. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Nuclear extracts from 3 to 5 billion Jurkat cells were applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column on an AKTA10 purifier (Amersham Biosciences). The column was run using Dignam buffer C with 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (1.0 ml) were collected, and 80 μl of every fifth fraction was used for immunoblot analysis. HDAC Assays—Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells transduced with Gfi1-FLAG or FLAG-Ajuba expressing or empty MSCV retroviral vectors were used for immunoprecipitation with the M2 affinity resin (Sigma) as described above. The beads were mixed with 200 μl of 50 μm HDAC assay substrate (Fluor-de-Lys HDAC assay, BioMol) and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. For each data point triplicate immunoprecipitations without and with TSA were analyzed. Aliquots were taken at 0.5 and 1.5 h, and the change in HDAC activity was determined according to the manufacturer's directions. TSA-sensitive relative-fluorescent units were generated by subtracting values for triplicate immunoprecipitations treated with TSA from values for triplicate immunoprecipitations treated with vehicle control. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The ChIP assay was performed as previously described (14Zarebski A. Velu C.S. Baktula A.M. Bourdeau T. Horman S.R. Basu S. Bertolone S.J. Horwitz M. Hildeman D.A.

Briefly, logarithmically growing HL60 cells (1 × 108 cells) were cross-linked using formaldehyde (final concentration, 1% v/v) in RPMI 1640 medium for 10 min on ice. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 0.125 m to stop cross-linking. Fixed cells were pelleted by centrifugation and sequentially washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1× Complete inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1× Complete inhibitor) and were sonicated to make soluble chromatin using Sonicator 3000 cup horn (Misonix). An aliquot of total chromatin was taken at this point to use as a positive control in the PCRs (input chromatin). The cell lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with Gfi1 monoclonal antibody (2.5D17) (22Kazanjian A. Wallis D. Au N. Nigam R. Venken K.J. Cagle P.T. Dickey B.F. Bellen H.J. Gilks C.B. Grimes H.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6874-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), Ajuba polyclonal antibody (4897) (Cell Signaling), and control mouse (GE Healthcare) or rabbit (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) IgG overnight at 4 °C. DNA·protein complexes were collected with protein A/G-Sepharose beads followed by several rounds of washing. Bound DNA·protein complexes were eluted from the antibodies with two incubations in elution buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) at room temperature for 15 min. Cross-links were reversed by addition of sodium chloride followed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. RNase A and proteinase K were sequentially added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA fragments were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and used for PCR amplifications. The PCR products were fractionated on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide. PCR primer pairs for the ChIP were: GFI1 (5′-CACACCTTCATCCACACAGG-3′ and 5′-GATGAGCTTTGCACACTGGA-3′); GFI1B (5′-GGGCGATGCATTCATTTCC-3′ and 5′-CACCTCGATTTTGGATTTCTAG-3′); CSF1 (5′-GGGCCTCTGGGGTGTAGTAT-3′ and 5′-CCGAGGCAAACTTTCACTTT-3′). β-ACTIN (5′-AGCGCGGCTACAGCTTCA-3′ and 5′-CGTAGCACAGCTTCTCCTTAATGTC-3′) was used as the negative control. Each experiment was performed at least twice with similar results, and representative data are shown. Quantitative PCR—TRIzol (Invitrogen) extracted RNA from shRNA vector-transduced cells was quantified, and equal amounts of RNA were utilized in first strand cDNA synthesis reaction and then applied to TaqMan probe sets for GFI1B (Hs00180261_m1), GFI1 (Hs00382207_m1), and CSF1 (Hs00174164_m1) according to the method of the manufacturer (ABI). Gfi1 Mediates Transcriptional Repression through Titratable-associated Factors—Gfi1 transcriptional repression may require limiting and titratable-associated factors (14Zarebski A. Velu C.S. Baktula A.M. Bourdeau T. Horman S.R. Basu S. Bertolone S.J. Horwitz M. Hildeman D.A. Trent J.O. Grimes H.L. Immunity. 2008; 28: 370-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Grimes H. Chan T. Zweidler-McKay P. Tong B. Tsichlis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). 293T cells are human epithelial kidney cells that express a low level of Gfi1 (15Doan L.L. Porter S.D. Duan Z. Flubacher M.M. Montoya D. Tsichlis P.N. Horwitz M. Gilks C.B. Grimes H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2508-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 293T cells were co-transfected with reporter constructs with or without “B30” (18Zweidler-Mckay P. Grimes H. Flubacher M. Tsichlis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4024-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) high affinity Gfi1 binding sites (Fig. 1A), and increasing amounts of expression vectors encoding Gfi1 or a Gfi1·SNAG repressor domain mutant in which all 20 amino acids of the SNAG domain have been replaced with the SV40 nuclear localization motif (SV40SWAP) (19Grimes H. Chan T. Zweidler-McKay P. Tong B. Tsichlis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Whereas low levels of the Gfi1 expression construct induced a significant increase in repression, expression construct levels in excess of 5 ng decreased repression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Immunoblot analysis confirmed increased protein levels (Fig. 1C). Notably, a titration of the Gfi1 SV40SWAP expression vector resulted in increased protein levels (Fig. 1C) but did not lead to significant repression at any level (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Thus, excess Gfi1 may disrupt functional Gfi1 transcription complexes, perhaps by sequestering limiting proteins required for an active Gfi1·SNAG repressor complex. The LIM Domain Protein Ajuba Increases Gfi1 Transcriptional Repression—Ajuba is a LIM domain protein that shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (6Kanungo J. Pratt S.J. Marie H. Longmore G.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3299-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, Ajuba interacted with a synthetic Gfi1·SNAG domain-containing construct to function as a corepressor (20Ayyanathan K. Peng H. Hou Z. Fredericks W.J. Goyal R.K. Langer E.M. Longmore G.D. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9097-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine if Ajuba affects cognate DNA-bound Gfi1 transcriptional repression functions, we performed transient transcription assays with Gfi1-responsive reporter constructs (Fig. 1A) and expression constructs encoding Gfi1 and Ajuba. Co-expression of Ajuba and Gfi1 significantly increased Gfi1-mediated repression when compared with the repression induced by GFI1 alone (Fig. 1D). Notably, the activity of the TK-CAT reporter, which lacks Gfi1 binding sites, was not altered by the presence of either Gfi1, or co-expression of Gfi1 and Ajuba (Fig. 1D). Thus, Ajuba effects on transcription repression in this assay are dependent upon the presence of Gfi1 DNA binding sites. Moreover, the level of Gfi1 protein was not affected by the overexpression of Ajuba (Fig. 1F). In agreement with the low level of Gfi1 in 293T cells (15Doan L.L. Porter S.D. Duan Z. Flubacher M.M. Montoya D. Tsichlis P.N. Horwitz M. Gilks C.B. Grimes H.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2508-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), transfected B30 × 2 TK reporters demonstrate modest endogenous Gfi1 repression activity (Fig. 1, B, C, and G). When Ajuba levels were decreased by shRNA knockdown, the activity of the Gfi1-responsive vector was equivalent to that of the non-responsive control (Fig. 1G). Thus, repression mediated by endogenous Gfi1 upon the B30 × 2 TK reporter is completely abrogated by shRNA against Ajuba, and endogenous Gfi1 requires endogenous Ajuba to mediate repression of the B30 × 2 TK reporter in 293T cells. These results strongly suggest that Ajuba acts as a co-repressor for cognate Gfi1 and validate the 293T system to determine the mechanism. Gfi1 Associates with Ajuba—To further study the in vivo association of endogenous proteins, we performed immunoprecipitation from Jurkat cell line nuclear extracts. We employed two different antisera against Ajuba, an antisera against LPP (a related LIM domain protein), and isotype-matched IgG as controls. Immunoprecipitants were analyzed by immunoblot for the presence of Gfi1 (Fig. 2A). Notably, endogenous Gfi1 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with antiserum against Ajuba, but not LPP or the isotype IgG (Fig. 2A). The amount of Gfi1 that co-immunoprecipitated with Ajuba was <10% of the input. Thus, endogenous Ajuba and Gfi1 form a complex in Jurkat nuclear extracts. Next, we broadly defined the protein domains (Fig. 2B) of interaction between Ajuba and Gfi1 by immunoprecipitating FLAG-epitope-tagged Gfi1 (or the SV40SWAP mutant), then analyzing by immunoblot for the presence of Myc-epitope-tagged Ajuba (or Ajuba mutants). Both Gfi1 and the SV40SWAP mutant co-immunoprecipitated with Ajuba (Fig. 2C). Unlike full-length Ajuba, the N-terminal Ajuba-PreLIM region did not co-immunoprecipitate with Gfi1 (Fig. 2D). However, the C-terminal Ajuba-LIM region co-immunoprecipitated with Gfi1 (Fig. 2E). Therefore, Ajuba associates with Gfi1 through the Ajuba LIM region, but this interaction is not dependent upon the Gfi1 SNAG domain. The LIM Domain of Ajuba Functions as a Corepressor—To confirm a co-repressor function for Ajuba, we performed transient transcription assays with chimeric proteins in which the N terminus of the bacterial DNA-binding protein LexA is fused to Ajuba, Ajuba mutants (Fig. 3A), or the N terminus of Gfi1 (Fig. 3B). Immunoblot analysis revealed that all the LexA fusion proteins were synthesized in 293T cells at the expected molecular weight (Fig. 3C). We previously demonstrated that the N terminus of Gfi1 transfers active transcriptional repression to LexA (19Grimes H. Chan T. Zweidler-McKay P. Tong B. Tsichlis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Indeed, co-transfection of a TK-CAT reporter containing two Lex operons (Fig. 3B) and an expression vector encoding Gfi1-LexA resulted in transcriptional repression (Fig. 3D). In contrast, co-transfection of LexA-Ajuba with the reporter did not yield significant repression (Fig. 3D). However, co-transfection of LexA-Ajuba with Gfi1-LexA induced significant, additive, and dose-dependent repression of the reporter (Fig. 3D). These data could either indicate that Ajuba is not a co-repressor, or that the co-repressor function of Ajuba may only be revealed upon binding to a nuclear target. To explore these possibilities we tested the function of LexA fusion to the Ajuba preLIM or LIM domains. Like LexA-Ajuba, LexA-PreLIM did not repress the activity of the reporter (Fig. 3E). In contrast, LexA-LIM induced significant and dose-dependent repression of the reporter (Fig. 3E). We reasoned that if the transcriptional activity of full-length Ajuba is hindered by intramolecular interactions, then LexA-LIM (which is only a portion of the protein) might be unhindered and potently synergize with Gfi1-LexA. In fact, LexA-LIM and Gfi1-LexA demonstrated significant dose-dependent and synergistic transcriptional repression (Fig. 3F). In contrast, LexA-PreLIM and Gfi1-LexA together resulted in reporter activity similar to Gfi1-LexA alone (Fig. 3F). Utilizing B30-TK-CAT reporter vectors and Gfi1 and Ajuba protein expression vectors (without LexA fusion), we find that the Pre-LIM domain does not increase Gfi1 repression. However, expression constructs encoding full-length Ajuba or isolated LIM domains increased Gfi1 repression (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, the Ajuba LIM domains function as a Gfi1 co-repressor. Gfi1 and Ajuba Interact Directly with HDACs—We next determined whether Gfi1 and Ajuba are in a multiprotein complex using gel-filtration chromatography. Gel filtration separates larger and smaller proteins in a complex mixture. Immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts fractionated on a Sephacryl S-300 column revealed elution profiles. HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 are part of protein complexes that elute at large molecular size fractions (24Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E.

To assess the role of p38 MAPK pathway in nucleotide excision repair (NER), the most versatile DNA repair pathway, we determined the efficiency of NER in cells treated with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and found that p38 MAPK is required for the prompt repair of UV-induced DNA damage CPD. We further investigated the possible mechanism through which p38 MAPK regulates NER and found that p38 MAPK mediates UV-induced histone H3 acetylation and chromatin relaxation.

Living organisms are incessantly exposed to a variety of DNA-damaging agents with potentially devastating consequences. To overcome the deleterious effects of such exposures, cells respond with a variety of defensive strategies to eliminate damage and maintain the integrity of their genome. Among them, nucleotide excision repair (NER) 3The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; 6-4PP, pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct; DDB, damaged DNA-binding protein; GG-NER, global genomic NER; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; ISB, immuno-slot blot. is the most important repair system that removes UV-induced photolesions, including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PP), as well as other bulky DNA adducts caused by different chemical carcinogens (1De Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). There are two subpathways of NER: global genome NER (GG-NER), which removes lesions from the entire genome, and transcription-coupled NER, which eliminates DNA damage from the transcribed strand of the actively transcribed genes (1De Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 2Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The two pathways differ mainly at the initial damage recognition steps. For transcription-coupled NER, the lesion is detected by stalled RNA polymerase during transcription (3Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 4Hanawalt P. Mellon I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 3: 67-69Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas for GG-NER, recognition of DNA lesions depends on specific DNA-binding proteins that have high affinity for damaged DNA, e.g. XPC. Evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies indicates that XPC comes to the damage site at a very early stage and is a critical GG-NER initiator (5Sugasawa K. Ng J.M.Y. Masutani C. Iwai S.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5293-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Although XPC has remarkable binding capacity to damaged DNA, XPC alone is not sufficient to recognize DNA lesions like CPD occurring deep within the chromatin (7Sugasawa K. Okamoto T. Shimizu Y.

Res. 2001; 485: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Another equally important factor, UV-damaged DNA binding (UV-DDB) complex, has emerged as a crucial player in recognizing and processing of CPD in the chromatin context (9Hwang B.J. Toering S.

Accumulating evidence has suggested that DDB helps recruit XPC to both CPD and 6-4PP and accelerates the repair of these lesions (17Fitch M.E. Nakajima S. Yasui A. Ford J.M. J. Biol.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, DDB can be considered as the initial damage recognition factor for UV-induced photolesions. DDB2, which is a subunit of the UV-DDB complex, is shown to undergo ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis following UV irradiation (19Chen X. Zhang Y. Douglas L. Zhou P. J. Biol.

Interestingly, despite its critical role in detection and repair of UV-induced DNA lesion in cells, DDB2 is not essential for reconstituted in vitro NER, suggesting that DDB2 is specifically required for the repair of lesions within chromatin (23Aboussekhra A.

The highly condensed nature of the chromatin fiber makes the access to DNA damage difficult for the repair factors and thus inhibitory to damage processing. Therefore, chromatin accessibility is an important feature in the detection and efficient removal of DNA lesions by GG-NER (28Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 269: 19034-19040Google Scholar, 29Ura K. Araki M. Saeki H. Masutani C. Ito T. Iwai S. Mizukoshi T. Kaneda Y. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2004-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Repair of both CPD and 6-4PP is affected by their location and accessibility because their repair is faster in the nucleosome-free and linker regions than in the nucleosome core (30Smerdon M.J. Thoma F. Cell. 1990; 61: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 31Wellinger R.E. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5046-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have also revealed a relationship of NER to UV-induced chromatin accessibility occurring through histone acetylation (32Ramanathan B. Smerdon M.J. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33Ramanathan B. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13441-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is reported that histone acetylation increases the chromatin accessibility and facilitates NER in mammalian cells. Furthermore, DNA repair synthesis is enhanced in hyperacetylated nucleosome (33Ramanathan B. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11026-11034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Smerdon M.J. Lan S.Y. Calza R.E. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13441-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the tumor suppressor protein p53, which enhances GG-NER, is also involved in UV-induced histone H3 and H4 acetylation and chromatin relaxation (35Rubbi C.P. Milner J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Another family of tumor suppressors, ING1 and ING2, are reported to enhance NER through histone acetylation and increased chromatin accessibility in a p53-dependent manner (36Cheung Jr., K.J. Mitchell D. Lin P. Li G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4974-4977PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wang J. Chin M.Y. Li G. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1906-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 38Kuo W.H. Wang Y. Wong R.P. Campos E.I. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1628-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All of these studies suggest that chromatin structure modification is an important parameter in DNA lesion accessibility and consequently efficient NER. The p38 MAPK, a serine/threonine kinase, is known to play important roles in cellular responses to various external stress signals. It has been shown that p38 MAPK is an important mediator of phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in response to UV (39Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is involved in the alteration of chromatin condensation during transcription activation and cell division (40Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p38 MAPK has been found to mediate H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 induced by cisplatin, which binds to DNA to form a covalent platinum-DNA adduct that is removed by NER (41Wang D. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20622-20625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus far, no report has attributed the UV-induced acetylation and global chromatin relaxation to the action of p38 MAPK, and it is still not known whether p38 MAPK plays any role in facilitating NER in response to UV. In the present report, we have studied the function of p38 MAPK in NER in cells exposed to UV irradiation. Our studies indicate that p38 MAPK is involved in UV-induced histone H3 acetylation at lysine 14 and chromatin relaxation. Our results also show that p38 MAPK, by regulating DDB2 degradation and consequently the recruitment of XPC and TFIIH, plays a pivotal role in the removal of UV lesion CPD through NER. Cell Lines and Treatments—Normal human fibroblasts (OSU-2) were established in our laboratory as described previously (42Venkatachalam S. Denissenko M. Wani A.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably transfected with NH2-terminal FLAG-hemagglutinin-tagged DDB2 (HeLa-DDB2) were a gift from Dr. Yoshihiro Nakatani (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). These cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. To study the function of p38 MAPK, the cells were pretreated with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or DMSO for 30 min before UV irradiation. To measure ubiquitylation of DDB2, HeLa-DDB2 cells were cultured in medium supplemented with MG132 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) 30 min before UV treatment. For UV irradiation, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, irradiated at varying UV doses, and incubated in appropriate medium for the desired time period. The irradiation was done with a germicidal lamp at a dose rate of 0.8 J/m2/s as measured by a Kettering model 65 radiometer (Cole Palmer Instrument, Co., Vernon Hill, IL). In Vivo Ubiquitylation and Phosphorylation Detection—DDB2 ubiquitylation and phosphorylation were detected as described before (43Li J. Wang Q.E. Zhu Q. El-Mahdy M.A. Wani G. Praetorius-Ibba M. Wani A.A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8590-8597Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa-DDB2 cells were treated with MG132 (10 μm) 30 min before UV irradiation at 40 J/m2 and kept in the same medium for indicated time periods. Whole cell lysates were prepared by boiling in SDS lysis buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blotting and detected with anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-serine, anti-phospho-tyrosine (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and anti-DDB2 antibodies. Western Blot Analysis of Proteins—The proteins were quantified and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the immunoblot analysis was done by using chemiluminescent detection. Phosphorylated MK2, phospho-Akt (Ser473), and phospho-H3 (Ser10) were detected by using rabbit polyclonal antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Phospho-ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and phospho-JNK (Promega) antibodies were used to detect the activated ERK and JNK, respectively. Acetyl-H3 (K14), acetyl-H3 (K9, 14), acetyl-H3 (K18), and acetyl-H4 were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Billerica, MA). Rabbit anti-DDB2 antibody was generated in our lab as described before (44Wang Q.E. Zhu Q. Wani G. El-Mahdy M.A. Li J. Wani A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 4023-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To serve as a loading control, total lamin B or actin levels in the cell lysates were detected using anti-lamin B or anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) Digestion Assay—The cells were trypsinized and resuspended in hypotonic cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 μm spermidine, 0.15 μm spermine, and protease inhibitor mixture). The cells were incubated on ice for 10 min followed by pipetting 10 times to release nuclei and low speed centrifugation. The nuclei were resuspended in 200 μl of MNase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2) and digested with a concentration range of MNase (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 5× stop solution (0.1 m EDTA, 0.01 m EGTA, pH 8.0). DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and 2 μg of DNA was separated on a 2% agarose gel. Quantification of CPD and 6-4PP by Immuno-Slot Blot (ISB) Analysis—A noncompetitive ISB assay, described earlier (45Wani A.A. D'Ambrosio S.M. Alvi N.K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 46: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was used to quantify the initial formation of UV-induced CPD or 6-4PP and those remaining in cells after desired time of repair. Briefly, after different treatments, the cells were lysed immediately for DNA isolation. The same amount of DNA was loaded on nitrocellulose membranes, and the amounts of CPD or 6-4PP were detected with monoclonal anti-CPD TDM-2 or anti-6-4PP 64 M-2 antibody (MBL International Corporation, Woburn, MA). Fractionation of Cellular Proteins—OSU-2 cells were pretreated with either SB203580 or DMSO for 30 min before UV irradiation at 20 J/m2. After further incubation for 30 min, the cells were harvested and subjected to cellular protein fractionation procedure as described earlier (46Wang Q.E. Zhu Q. Wani G. Chen J. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytoplasm and nuclei were first separated by suspending cells in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture) and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation, the supernatant was saved as S, and the nuclear pellet was then treated with a higher concentration of Triton X-100 (1%) in LS buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture) to remove the nuclear envelope and recover the fraction of nucleoplasmic soluble proteins, designated as TW. The nuclear pellet was further extracted consecutively with increasing concentrations (0.3, 0.5, and 2.0 m) of NaCl in LS buffer to result in supernatant fractions, designated as 0.3, 0.5, and 2.0, respectively. Each protein fraction, corresponding to an equivalent cell number, was loaded on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-DDB2 antibody. Localized Micropore UV Irradiation and Immunofluorescent Staining—OSU-2 cells growing on glass coverslips were pretreated with either SB203580 or DMSO for 30 min, and the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and UV-irradiated through a 5-μm isopore polycarbonate filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described previously (47Wang Q.E. Zhu Q. Wani M.A. Wani G. Chen J. Wani A.A. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 483-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cells were then double stained with rabbit anti-XPC and mouse anti-CPD (TDM-2, MBL International Corporation), or rabbit anti-XPB and mouse anti-CPD, or rabbit-anti-phospho-p38 and mouse anti-CPD antibodies. Fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red conjugates of anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were simultaneously used for the detection of primary antibody binding. Fluorescence images were obtained with a Nikon fluorescence microscope E80i (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with appropriate filters for fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red. The digital images were then captured with a cooled CCD camera and processed with the help of its SPOT software (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). p38 MAPK Is Required for Optimal Repair of UV-induced CPD—To study the role of p38 MAPK in NER, we inhibited p38 MAPK activity with its specific pharmacological inhibitor, SB203580. This pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor (structure shown in Fig. 1A) is now extensively used to understand the role of p38 MAPK. It has been shown to selectively inhibit p38 MAPK activity without significantly affecting the activity of other MAP kinases, e.g. JNK and ERK (48Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). To determine the inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by SB203580, OSU-2 cells or HeLa-DDB2 cells were pretreated with SB203580 at different concentrations followed by UV irradiation at 20 J/m2. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using phospho-MK2-specific antibody. MK2, often referred to as MAPK-activated protein kinase-2, is a physiological target of p38 MAPK (49Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. onso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation of MK2 indicates the activation of p38 MAPK. We found that the phospho-MK2 level was markedly elevated after UV irradiation in control DMSO-treated cells. In contrast, cells treated with 10 μm SB203580 exhibited a dramatic reduction of UV-induced MK2 activation in both OSU-2 (Fig. 1B) and HeLa-DDB2 (Fig. 1C) cell lines. Importantly, however, drug concentrations below 5 μm exhibited a markedly reduced inhibitory effect on p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, in this study we used 10 μm SB203580 to effectively suppress UV-induced p38 MAPK activity in both OSU and HeLa-DDB2 cells. At this concentration, we did not observe an evident inhibition of ERK and JNK activities in either OSU-2 (Fig. 1E) or HeLa-DDB2 cells (Fig. 1F). It should be noted that higher concentrations (>1 μm) of SB203580 are reported to also inhibit the interleukin-2-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in T cells independent of p38 MAPK (50Lali F.V.

We tested for this in our system and found that in OSU-2 cells UV irradiation at 20 J/m2 failed to exhibit any elevation of phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) within 24 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 1D). Moreover, within a short period of time (30 min) after UV treatment, an even higher dose of UV (100 or 200 J/m2) did not induce any activation of Akt (Fig. 1E). Similarly, in HeLa-DDB2 cells, we did not observe the activation of Akt after UV irradiation at 20 or 40 J/m2 (Fig. 1F). More importantly, 10 μm concentration of SB203580 did not have any inhibitory effect on the basal level of phospho-Akt in both OSU-2 and HeLa-DDB2 cells (Fig. 1, D–F). Therefore, Akt activity is not likely a candidate for the effects observed upon 10 μm SB203580 treatment of cell lines in this study. Next, we tested the effect of modulating p38 MAPK activity on the efficiency of NER. OSU-2 cells were treated with SB203580 or DMSO for 30 min and then UV-irradiated at a dose of 10 J/m2. The cells were allowed to repair for indicated time periods and analyzed for the activity of p38 MAPK and the removal of UV-induced CPD using ISB analysis with anti-CPD antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, p38 MAPK activity was successfully inhibited by SB203580 at each time point. When p38 MAPK was inhibited by SB203580, efficiency of NER was severely compromised as reflected by a decreased removal rate of UV-induced CPD (Fig. 2B). In fact, 8 h after UV treatment, only 55% of CPD remained in control cells in comparison with 87% CPD remaining in cells with suppressed p38 MAPK activity. Similarly, 41% CPD was left in control cells after 24 h of repair in contrast to 70% CPD in cells with curtailed p38 MAPK activity. Notably, however, the repair of another UV-induced DNA lesion, 6-4PP, was not affected by inactivation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that p38 MAPK is required for prompt repair of UV-induced CPD. p38 MAPK Affects UV-induced Chromatin Relaxation and Histone Acetylation—Upon UV irradiation of cells, p38 MAPK has been reported to phosphorylate histone H3 at serine 10 (39Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), indicating its potential role in modulating chromatin remodeling in response to UV treatment. Because repair of DNA damage occurs within highly condensed chromatin fibers, the relaxation of chromatin structure is necessary for the accessibility of damaged DNA to repair proteins (29Ura K. Araki M. Saeki H. Masutani C. Ito T. Iwai S. Mizukoshi T. Kaneda Y. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2004-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 51Wang Z.G. Wu X.H. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24064-24071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that increased efficiency of NER caused by p38 MAPK function results from enhanced chromatin relaxation. To ascertain this possibility, OSU-2 cells were grown in serum-free medium for 48 h before UV treatment to arrest cells in the G0/G1 phase. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that following serum starvation 89.4% of the cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase (Fig. 3A, upper panel) compared with 47.6% of cells grown in complete medium (Fig. 3A, lower panel). The serum-starved growth-arrested cells were pretreated with SB203580 to inhibit p38 MAPK activity or treated with DMSO as control and then UV-irradiated at 200 J/m2. After a further 30 min of incubation, the cell nuclei were gently isolated and subjected to digestion with appropriately titrated concentrations of MNase. Among the three different concentrations tested, lower and higher MNase concentrations were unable to clearly distinguish the effect of the inhibitor on nuclease digestibility (Fig. 3B). In contrast, intermediate MNase concentration (0.5 units/ml) provided easily discernable digestion patterns between unirradiated versus irradiated as well as in absence and presence of the inhibitor. Chromatin relaxation at 30 min after UV irradiation, observed in control cells, was reflected by dramatically increased DNA sensitivity to MNase. However, when p38 MAPK activity was suppressed, UV-mediated increased DNA sensitivity to MNase was dramatically reversed. (Fig. 3B). This result suggests that UV-induced chromatin relaxation is intimately modulated by the activation of p38 MAPK. Histone acetylation is believed to play an important role in chromatin remodeling during the NER process (32Ramanathan B. Smerdon M.J. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33Ramanathan B. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13441-13447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether the effect of p38 MAPK on chromatin relaxation is invoked through histone acetylation, growth-arrested OSU-2 cells were pretreated with SB203580 and then analyzed for the status of histone H3 acetylation immediately after UV irradiation. Fig. 3C shows the H3 acetylation at lysines 9, 14, and 18 by the use of specific anti-AcH3 antibodies. Histone H3 acetylation between p38 MAPK-active and p38 MAPK-inactive cells was essentially unaltered for lysines 9 and 18. On the other hand, acetylation at H3 lysine 14 showed a prompt increase within 10 min of UV treatment and subsequent return to basal levels within 30 min. However, upon p38 MAPK inhibition, histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation levels were negligible under both physiological conditions and after UV treatment. It is clear that specific histone acetylation occurring at specific lysine residues after UV irradiation is impaired in the absence of p38 MAPK, which could be instrumental in decreased chromatin relaxation and NER. We further tested the effect of SB203580 on UV-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 in growth-arrested OSU-2 cells. UV induced a dramatic increase of phospho-H3 (Ser10) in DMSO-treated cells, whereas in cells deprived of p38 MAPK activity, phospho-H3 (Ser10) level remained the same as nonirradiated cells (Fig. 3D). p38 MAPK Participates in UV-induced DDB2 Degradation—p38 MAPK is known to regulate degradation of many cellular proteins through their phosphorylation (52Poizat C.

It was discovered in the vitreous of the bovine eye, but is now known to be ubiquitously distributed and is recognized as the major glycosaminoglycan type present in the extracellular matrix (1McDonald J.

HA serves as a scaffold for other molecules and participates in diverse physiological and cellular functions by interacting with specific binding domains in proteins. Moreover, alterations in HA metabolism, distribution, and function have been documented in diseases such as arthritis, immune and inflammatory disorders, pulmonary and vascular disease, and cancer. HA is well recognized as an important determinant of cancer cell behavior, and increased production of HA is associated with tumors (2Toole B.P. Wight T.N. Tammi M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4593-4596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In addition, soluble HA-binding proteins have been shown to have antitumorigenic properties (3Xu X.M.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) belongs to the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily of proteins, which are related through a highly conserved folded protein conformation (4Becerra S.P. Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 82: 739-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Unlike most serpins, PEDF does not inhibit serine proteases, but like most of them it is secreted and found extracellularly in a variety of matrixes, body fluids, and tissues (e.g. the vitreous, interphotoreceptor matrix, aqueous humor, serum, cerebral spinal fluid, bone, and cartilage) (5Becerra S.P.

Although PEDF was discovered as a retinal pigment epithelium-derived differentiation factor for human retinoblastoma cells (10Tombran-Tink J. Chader G.G. Johnson L.V. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 53: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), it exhibits several other activities in and outside of the eye. Numerous reports have demonstrated the involvement of PEDF in neuronal differentiation and survival, as well as inhibition of angiogenesis (11Bouck N. Trends Mol.

The antitumor effects of PEDF are believed to involve the induction of differentiation or apoptosis of tumor cells (20Fernandez-Garcia N.I. Volpert O.V. Jimenez B. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of PEDF as a neurotrophic and antiangiogenic factor are known to be mediated by binding to receptors on the surface of cells (4Becerra S.P. Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 82: 739-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but little is known about the mechanisms that govern the cellular events for the PEDF antitumor activity. Previous studies have described the association of PEDF with extracellular matrix components, such as collagens and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (heparin, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates) (21Alberdi E.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mapping of collagen- and heparin-binding sites on mouse PEDF revealed that the acidic amino acid residues Asp255, Asp257, and Asp299 are critical to collagen I binding, and that three clustered basic amino acid residues Arg145, Lys146, and Arg148 are necessary for heparin binding (25Yasui N. Mori T. Morito D. Matsushita O. Kourai H. Nagata K. Koide T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is also apparent that the biological activities of PEDF require the participation of its extracellular matrix-binding properties. Mutational analysis supports the involvement of the collagen I binding site in the anti-angiogenic activity of PEDF (26Hosomichi J. Yasui N. Koide T. Soma K. Morita I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Experiments with heparin- and heparan sulfate-depleted cells support the importance of heparin/heparan sulfate in efficient cell surface receptor binding of PEDF (27Alberdi E.M. Weldon J.E. Becerra S.P. BMC Biochem. 2003; 4: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recent studies provide evidence that heparin induces a conformational change in PEDF that could facilitate its interactions with a receptor on the cell surface (28Valnickova Z. Petersen S.V. Nielsen S.B. Otzen D.E. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6661-6667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Given that PEDF colocalizes with HA in extracellular matrixes, and both are highly concentrated in the interphotoreceptor matrix (5Becerra S.P. Fariss R.N. Wu Y.Q. Montuenga L.M. Wong P. Pfeffer B.A. Exp. Eye Res. 2004; 78: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Hollyfield J.G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 2767-2769PubMed Google Scholar) we compared and aligned the amino acid sequences of PEDF to known HA-binding proteins for structure-function studies. We found that PEDF from several species contains regions with strong homology to the HA-binding motifs of known HA-binding proteins CD44, RHAMM, hyaluronidase, and BH-P (see Table 1). Linear basic residue clusters span between residues Lys134–Lys151 and Lys189–Lys197 of the human PEDF sequence. They contain motifs that conform to the sequence pattern BX7B, in particular BX3AB2XB and BXBX2BX2B, where B represents lysine or arginine residues separated by amino acids, excluding aspartic or glutamic acid in the latter, but having only one glutamic acid residue (A) in the former homologous motif. However, it is not known yet whether PEDF binds to HA. In this study, we used retinoblastoma-derived or highly purified HA and recombinant human or bovine PEDF, as well as chemically modified and genetically engineered PEDF, to investigate the possible interactions between PEDF and HA. We found that PEDF binds to HA, provide evidence for an HA-binding site, and discuss implications in PEDF biology.TABLE 1Comparison and alignment of PEDF amino acid sequences and HA-binding proteins at HA-binding regions Materials—Hyaluronate lyase (EC 4.2.2.1) purified from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Determination of the concentration and the degree of labeling was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Conditioned Media—Human retinoblastoma Y-79 cells (0.45–5 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in defined media (minimal essential medium containing 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen)) at 37 °C for 16–24 h. The conditioned media was separated from the cells by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and concentrated by ultrafiltration using membrane filters with a molecular weight cut off of 10,000 (Amicon YM10 filters). Analysis of HA and Chondroitin Glycosaminoglycans—The glycosaminoglycans in the media conditioned by Y-79 cells were analyzed by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, a procedure for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of glycosaminoglycans. The details of methods used for sample preparation, carbohydrate analysis, and quantitation have been previously described (31Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 32Calabro A. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 199-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Culture medium was treated with proteinase K to free glycosaminoglycans from their core protein and boiled to inactivate proteinase K. The digests were concentrated and ethanol-precipitated to pellet any macromolecular material, including the HA and chondroitin chains. The supernatant solution containing the low molecular weight molecules, such as glucose and salts, was aspirated. The precipitate was re-suspended in 100 μl of 0.0005% phenol red, 100 nm ammonium acetate, pH 7. The ammonium acetate extracts were digested at 37 °C with 100 milliunits/ml of Streptococcus dysgalactiae hyaluronidase for 1 h, followed by 3 h with the addition of 100 milliunits/ml of Proteus vulgaris chondroitinase ABC. The enzyme digests were dried on a vacuum concentrator and derivatized by addition of 20 μl of 12.5 mm 2-aminoacrodone HCl (AMAC) in 85% DMSO/15% acetic acid followed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature. Then, 20 μl of 1.25 m sodium cyanoborohydride in ultrapure water were added followed by incubation for 16 h at 37 °C. After derivatization, 10 μl of glycerol (20% final concentration) was added to each sample prior to electrophoresis. All derivatized samples were stored in the dark at -70 °C. The derivatized unknown samples to be run in separate lanes were spiked with one AMAC-derivatized chondroitin ΔDi2S as an internal standard. Media did not contain ΔDi2S standard, thus suitable as spiked standard. Samples were applied on MONO™ composition gels with MONO™ gel running buffer. Electrophoresis was at 4 °C for 80 min with a constant 500 V, with a starting current of 25 mA/gel and a final current of 10 mA/gel. The gels in their glass supports were illuminated with UV light (365 nm) from an Ultra Lum Transilluminator, and imaged with a Quantix cooled charge-coupled device camera (Roper Scientific/Photometrics). The images were analyzed using the Gel-Pro Analyzer™ program version 3.0 (Media Cybernetics). The digital images shown under “Results” depict oversaturated pixel intensity for the major derivatized structures to allow visualization of less abundant derivatized carbohydrates. Quantitation was performed on gel images having all pixels within a linear 12-bit intensity depth range. Cetylpyridinium Chloride Precipitation—To demonstrate HA binding, we used a protocol previously described (34Goodstone N.J. Hascall V.C. Calabro A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 35Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Solutions of PEDF and HA were mixed as indicated and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. The glycosaminoglycans were precipitated in the presence of 1.25% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The precipitate was separated by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. at 4 °C, washed with 200 μl of 1% CPC in phosphate-buffered saline, and finally mixed with 30 μl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Protein detection in gels was performed with Coomassie Blue staining or immunostaining after Western blotting. Conditioned media from several batches of retinoblastoma cell cultures (total ∼50 ml; 1.25 × 105 cells/ml) were tested for PEDF binding to glycosaminoglycans by coprecipitation of PEDF by CPC. Media were concentrated to a final protein concentration in the range of 1–20 μg/ml. Half of each sample was treated with hyaluronidase. BSA was added to each so that the final protein concentration in each medium batch was 100 μg/ml. Purified recombinant human PEDF (10–12 μg) was added to each concentrated medium (500 μl) and the mixture incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. CPC precipitation was followed as described above. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Single point mutations to convert each Lys189, Lys191, Lys197, Arg194, Asp256, Asp258, and Asp300, and three cumulative alterations Lys146/Lys147/Arg149, Lys189/Lys191/Lys197/Arg194, and Asp256/Asp258/Asp300 into alanine residues were performed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis by Lofstrand Labs. The human PEDF cDNA in plasmid πFS17 (18Steele F.R. Chader G.J. Johnson L.V. Tombran-Tink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1526-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) was transferred to pBK-CMV (Stratagene) to be used as template for mutagenesis. Four primers were designed for the preparation of each construct: Nhe/EcoR primer (S) (5′-ACG GCT AGC GAA TTC AAG CGG ACG CTG GAT TAG-3′), HinDIII primer (A) (5′-GGG AAG CTT TTT TTT TTT TTA GGG ATA AAG CTC-3′), and the sense (S) and antisense (A) primers for each desired mutation. The Nhe/EcoR primer is in the upstream of the PEDF starting codon and the HinDIII primer is in the downstream of PEDF stop codon. The sequences of the primer sets for each desired mutation are annotated below with the base changes underlined: K146/147/149A (S), TTT GAG GCG GCG CTG GCC ATA AAA TCC AGC TTT GTG GC; K146/147/149A (A), TTT TAT GGC CAG CGC CGC CTC AAA GAC GAT CCG GGA GGC; K189A (S), GCG CAG ATG GCA GGG AAG CTC GCC AGG TCC; K189A (A), GAG CTT CCC TGC CAT CTG CGC CTG CAC CC; K191A (S), ATG AAA GGG GCG CTC GCC AGG TCC ACA AAG; K191A (A), CCT GGC GAG CGC CCC TTT CAT CTG CGC CTG; R194A (S), AAG CTC GCC GCG TCC ACA AAG GAA ATT CCC; R194A (A), CTT TGT GGA CGC GGC GAG CTT CCC TTT CAT C; K197A (S), AGG TCC ACA GCG GAA ATT CCC GAT GAG ATC; K197A (A), GGG AAT TTC CGC TGT GGA CCT GGC GAG CTT C; K189/191/194/197A (S), GCA GGG GCG CTC GCC GCG TCC ACA GCG GAA ATT CCC GAT GAG ATC AGC ATT C; K189/191/194/197A (A), CGC TGT GGA CGC GGC GAG CGC CCC TGC CAT CTG CGC CTG CAC CCA GTT GTT G; D256/258A (S), GGC TTG GCT TCA GCT CTC AGC TGC AAG ATT G; D256/258A (A), GCT GAG AGC TGA AGC CAA GCC ATA GCG TAA AAC; D300A (S), TTC ATT CAT GCC ATA GAC CGA GAA CTG AAG; and D300A (A), TCG GTC TAT GGC ATG AAT GAA CTC GGA GG. Two primary PCRs were performed using pBKCMV/PEDF as the DNA template with Nhe/EcoR primer and antisense primer (A) for desire mutation or HinDIII primer and sense primer (S) for desire mutation. The products from two primary PCR reactions were annealed and used as the template for secondary PCR with the Nhe/EcoR primer/HinDIII primer set. The full length of PEDF with the appropriate mutation from secondary PCR and pBKCMV/PEDF were digested with NheI/HinDIII and ligated together. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All constructs were prepared following this strategy using the respective primer sets. Site-directed mutagenesis to convert the Lys134, Lys137, Lys189, and Lys191 into Ala was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following instructions by the manufacturer. The template was plasmid phbPEDF (36Perez-Mediavilla L.A. Chew C. Campochiaro P.A. Nickells R.W. Notario V. Zack D.J. Becerra S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which contains the first 43 codons of the human PEDF cDNA (codons 1–20 correspond to a secretion signal peptide) followed by the 42–416 codons of the bovine PEDF cDNA. Amino acid numbers for this set of mutants refer to alignment with the human sequence. Cumulative mutations were obtained sequentially starting from the template to prepare pPEDF(K134A), which served as template to prepare pPEDF(K134/137A), which served as template for pPEDF(K134A/K137A/K189A), which served as template to prepare pPEDF(K134A/K137A/K189A, K191A). Sequences of primers used to generate desired mutations are annotated with the base changes underlined: 5′-CGTCACCGCCCCCCAGGCGAACCTTAAGAGTGC-3′ and 5′-GCACTCTTAAGGTTCGCCTGGGGGGCGGTGACG-3′ for pPEDF(K134A); 5′-GCCCCCCAGGCGAACCTTGCGAGTGCTTCCCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGGAAGCACTCGCAAGGTTCGCCTGGGGGGC-3′ for pPEDF(K134/137A); 5′-GTGCAGGCCCAGATGGCAGGGAAAGTCGCTAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTAGCGACTTTCCCTGCCATCTGGGCCTGCAC-3′ for pPEDF(K134A/K137A/K189A); and 5′-GCCCAGATGGCAGGGGCAGTGCCTAGGTCCACG-3′ and 5′-CGTGGACCTAGCGACTGCCCCTGCCATCTGGGC-3′ for pPEDF(K134A/K137A/K189A and K191A). Original codons for lysines (AAG or AAA), in the sense strand, were substituted by the GCG or GCA alanine codons. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PEDF coding sequences with the desired mutations in all expression vectors were under the control of the CMV transcriptional promoter within the pBK-CMV (Stratagene) containing a neomycin-resistant gene sequence. Recombinant Expression of PEDF in BHK Cells—DNA expression vectors were introduced into BHK cells. PEDF protein is undetectable in media of BHK cells and in their corresponding cell extracts (36Perez-Mediavilla L.A. Chew C. Campochiaro P.A. Nickells R.W. Notario V. Zack D.J. Becerra S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Selection of transfected cells was performed by culturing them in the presence of 400 μg/ml neomycin as described before (36Perez-Mediavilla L.A. Chew C. Campochiaro P.A. Nickells R.W. Notario V.

Transfected BHK cells were incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% serum for 24 h and then without serum for 24 h in repetitive cycles as described before (24Stratikos E. Alberdi E. Gettins P.G. Becerra S.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Serum-free conditioned media from each cycle were harvested, filtered, and concentrated before using for HA binding assays. Cation-exchange Column Chromatography—Cation-exchange column chromatography of modified proteins was performed as described before (24Stratikos E. Alberdi E. Gettins P.G. Becerra S.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Media of transfected cells, as above, were dialyzed against buffer S (20 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.5) containing 50 mm NaCl, and the clear dialysates were injected into a strong cation-exchange resin (POROS HS™, 1.7-ml bed volume) in a column attached to an automated perfusion chromatography work station (BioCad 700E, Applied BioSystems) that had been equilibrated with buffer S plus 50 mm NaCl with a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The column was washed with equilibration buffer to remove unbound material (25 column volumes). Elution of bound PEDF protein was accomplished with 15 column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (50–500 mm) in buffer S, collected in 1-ml fractions. The A280 nm, column pressure, pH, and conductivity gradients were recorded automatically in a real-time chromatogram. Aliquots from peak fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Other Methods—Proteins in samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in Tricine/SDS buffer as described by the manufacturer (Novex). Protein detection was by Coomassie Blue, Ponceau Red, or immunostaining after Western blotting immunoreactions against Ab-rPEDF performed as described previously (9Wu Y.Q. Notario V. Chader G.J. Becerra S.P. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Collagen I-binding assays for PEDF were performed as described before (23Meyer C. Notari L. Becerra S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45400-45407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Heparin affinity column chromatography for PEDF was performed as described previously (21Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). HA-affinity Sepharose was prepared as described in the supplemental materials, and the chromatography was performed as for heparin affinity column chromatography (21Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The determination of uronic acid content in HA solutions was performed as described in the supplemental materials. PEDF Affinity for HA Secreted by Retinoblastoma Y-79 Cells— We examined the presence of HA in media conditioned by retinoblastoma Y-79 cells by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, a procedure for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of glycosaminoglycans. Electrophoretic patterns of AMAC-labeled carbohydrates from media from two different batches of Y-79 cells (Fig. 1A) showed the presence of ΔDiHA, specific products of HA, which were absent in media not conditioned by Y-79 cells (negative control media). The single band midway between the ΔDi4S and ΔDi6S standards consists of these two chondroitin disaccharides that do not resolve in these preparations. The lack of separation between the two chondroitin disaccharides in retinal pigment epithelial cell cultures and matrices has been previously reported (33deS Senanayake P. Calabro A. Nishiyama K. Hu J.G. Bok D. Hollyfield J.G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 199-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unsulfated chondroitin disaccharide was at or below detection levels. The disaccharide concentrations estimated from fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis for HA, and chondroitin 6S and 4S were 70 ± 3 pmol/ml media and 30.3 ± 4.4 pmol/ml media, respectively, indicating release of HA, and chondroitin 6S and 4S into the medium of Y-79"
https://openalex.org/W1993339711,"CSR1 (cellular stress response 1), a newly characterized tumor-suppressor gene, undergoes hypermethylation in over 30% of prostate cancers. Re-expression of CSR1 inhibits cell growth and induces cell death, but the mechanism by which CSR1 suppresses tumor growth is not clear. In this study, we screened a prostate cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system and found that the cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor 3 (CPSF3), an essential component for converting heteronuclear RNA to mRNA, binds with high affinity to the CSR1 C terminus. Further analyses determined that the binding motifs for CPSF3 are located between amino acids 440 and 543. The interaction between CSR1 and CPSF3 induced CPSF3 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in inhibition of polyadenylation both in vitro and in vivo. Downregulation of CPSF3 using small interfering RNA induced cell death in a manner similar to CSR1 expression. A CSR1 mutant unable to bind to CPSF3 did not alter CPSF3 subcellular distribution, did not inhibit its polyadenylation activity and did not induce cell death. In summary, CSR1 appears to induce cell death through a novel mechanism by hijacking a critical RNA processing enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2062505304,"The pathophysiological mechanisms that drive the development and progression of epithelial ovarian cancer remain obscure. Recently, we identified TCEAL7 as a transcriptional regulatory protein often downregulated in epithelial ovarian cancer. However, the biological significance of such downregulation in cancer is not currently known. Here, we show that TCEAL7 is downregulated frequently in many human cancers and that in immortalized human ovarian epithelial cells this event promotes anchorage-independent cell growth. Mechanistic investigations revealed that TCEAL7 associates with cyclin D1 promoter containing Myc E-box sequence and transcriptionally represses cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, downregulation of TCEAL7 promotes DNA-binding activity of Myc-Max, and upregulates the promoter activity of c-Myc-target gene, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), whereas enhanced expression of TCEAL7 inhibits Myc-induced promoter activity of ODC. Our findings suggest that TCEAL7 may restrict ovarian epithelial cell transformation by limiting Myc activity. These results also suggest a potential, alternative mechanism by which c-Myc activity may be deregulated in cancer by the downregulation of TCEAL7."
https://openalex.org/W1989694400,"During development inhibitor of DNA-bind-2 (Id2) regulates proliferation and differentiation. Id2 expression has been detected in cancer cells, yet its cellular function and validity as a therapeutic target remains largely unknown. Immunohistochemical analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens revealed that Id2 was undetectable in normal colonic mucosa, but occurs in 40% of primary tumors and in most CRC liver metastases (P<0.0001). Additionally, Id2 was expressed in all CRC cell lines assayed. CRC cells with reduced Id2 expression demonstrated reduced proliferation. Analysis of CRC cell cycle regulatory proteins showed that reducing Id2 levels reduces cyclin D1 levels and increased p21 levels. Reduction of Id2 expression also enhanced tumor cell apoptosis, increasing levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim/Bod, and cleavage of caspase-7 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. In vivo studies show tumors derived from cells with decreased Id2 levels formed smaller tumors with fewer metastases compared with tumors with normal levels (P<0.05). Furthermore, intraperitoneal administration of Id2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) conjugated with the neutral liposome 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine decreased tumor burden in mice compared with control treatment (P=0.006). We conclude that Id2 is upregulated in CRC, and is important in promoting cell survival. In vivo targeting of Id2 by siRNA establishes that it is a valid therapeutic target where its expression occurs."

Although most proteasomal substrates are targeted for degradation via conjugation of polyubiquitin chains, we show that ubiquitination is not required for HBZ-mediated proteasomal degradation of c-Jun. We demonstrate that HBZ directly interacts with both the 26 S proteasome and c-Jun and facilitates the delivery of c-Jun to the proteasome without ubiquitination.

These findings disclose a novel viral strategy to utilize the cellular proteolytic system for viral propagation. Protein degradation plays a variety of roles in fundamental cellular processes, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, immune response, and disposal of misfolded or oxidized proteins (1Davies K.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 2DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol.

Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3304) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome system has evolved as a key machinery in the selective degradation of intracellular short-lived regulatory or abnormal proteins. Most proteasomal substrates are tagged with polyubiquitin, which serves as a recognition signal for the 26 S proteasome. The cellular machinery that adds ubiquitin to substrates consists of three main enzyme classes. The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme transfers activated ubiquitin to the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which, in combination with E3 ubiquitin ligase, transfers ubiquitin to the substrate. The E3 ubiquitin ligase associates with the substrate and confers substrate specificity (3Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3304) Google Scholar).The proteasome is a major nonlysosomal proteolytic apparatus. The catalytic core of this multisubunit proteolytic complex is the 20 S proteasome. The addition of a 19 S regulatory complex to either or both ends of the 20 S proteasome forms the 26 S proteasome. The 19 S regulatory complex recognizes polyubiquitin chains on substrates and catalyzes deubiquitination, denaturation, and translocation of the unfolded substrate into the 20 S catalytic core for degradation (4Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). Thus, the substrates for the actual proteolysis are unfolded and nonubiquitinated. Therefore, if a protein can be delivered to the proteasome in a denatured or partially unfolded state, ubiquitination should not be required for its degradation (5Prakash S. Tian L. Ratliff K.S.

However, the mechanism by which proteasomes recognize nonubiquitinated substrates is not well understood.A variety of viruses are known to utilize the host ubiquitin-proteasome system to dysregulate cellular functions for their benefit. Notably, human papillomavirus type-16 E6 protein acts as a part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to promote ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the tumor suppressor, p53 (14Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). There are an increasing number of viral proteins that utilize cellular ubiquitination machinery (15Knight J.S. Sharma N. Robertson E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). HTLV-1-induced disruption of cellular transcription is associated with the development of adult T-cell leukemia. Tax, one of the HTLV-1-encoded proteins, is postulated to play a pivotal role in the development of adult T-cell leukemia (19Yoshida M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 475-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Although Tax promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of infected cells, it is a major target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (20Kannagi M. Harada S. Maruyama I. Inoko H. Igarashi H. Kuwashima G. Sato S. Morita M. Kidokoro M. Sugimoto M. Funahashi S. Osame M. Shida H. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), thus the overexpression of viral protein is disadvantageous for the survival of infected cells. There are significant involvements of other viral factors that control viral expression (21Inoue J. Yoshida M. Seiki M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, a novel viral protein, HTLV-1 basic leucine-zipper factor (HBZ), which is encoded in the complementary strand of the HTLV-1 genome, was identified (23Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12813-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). HBZ is a nuclear protein that contains a transactivation domain and a basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) domain in its N and C termini, respectively. HBZ interacts with cellular bZIP proteins, particularly the AP-1 family of transcription factors, and regulates their transcriptional activities, allowing the virus to control viral gene transcription from the HTLV-1 promoter (23Gaudray G.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We previously reported that HBZ interacts with c-Jun, an AP-1 family member, and suppresses its transcriptional activity by two distinct mechanisms. HBZ not only impairs the DNA-binding activity of c-Jun but also promotes its proteasomal degradation (26Matsumoto J. Ohshima T. Isono O. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).In this study, we show that ubiquitination is not required for HBZ-mediated proteasomal degradation of c-Jun. We demonstrate that HBZ directly interacts with both the 26 S proteasome and c-Jun and facilitates the delivery of c-Jun to the proteasome without ubiquitination. HBZ acts as a tethering factor between the 26 S proteasome and its substrate, thereby bypassing the targeting function of ubiquitination.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfection, and Reagents—HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 4 mm l-glutamine, and 0.1 mg/ml kanamycin sulfate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Mouse ts20 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Harvey Ozer) were cultured similarly, but maintained at 35 °C (the permissive temperature). C8166 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm l-glutamine. Transfections were performed using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Sciences) for HEK-293T cells, or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for ts20 cells following the manufacturer's protocol. However, in the experiment in Fig. 1B, HEK-293T cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 ;m, Peptide Institute) for 12 h prior to collection.Plasmids—pcDNA3-FLAG-HBZ, pcDNA3-HA-c-Jun, and pcDNA3-c-Jun-Myc-His have been described previously (26Matsumoto J. Ohshima T. Isono O. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Deletions and point mutants of HBZ and c-Jun were generated by PCR amplification of pcDNA3-FLAG-HBZ and pcDNA3-HA-c-Jun, respectively. These PCR fragments were then subcloned into expression vectors such as pcDNA3-FLAG, pcDNA3-HA, pcDNA3-His (Invitrogen), pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences), or pGBT9 (Clontech). In addition, pcDNA3-FLAG-HBZ-SI was generated by PCR using pcDNA3-FLAG-HBZ as a template. The cDNAs were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from MT-2 cells (for c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, ATF1, ATF2, ATF4, CREB, p53, and GADD34), 293T cells (for ubiquitin, Rpn5, MCM5, MCM7, and DET1), and Saos-2 cells (for COP1). They were subcloned into pcDNA3-FLAG, pcDNA3-Myc, pcDNA3-HA, pcDNA3-His, or pCAG vectors. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the dominant-negative ubiquitin mutant (Ub-K48R), which contains an Arg substitution at Lys-48. To generate pcDNA3-FLAG-c-JunLZ/p53, the fragment encoding the c-Jun leucine-zipper region (273-310 amino acids) was PCR-amplified from pcDNA3-HA-c-Jun, digested with BamHI, and subcloned in-frame into BamHI-linearized pcDNA3-FLAG-p53.Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and hybridized with the appropriate primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for subsequent detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The antibodies used in this study were specific for FLAG (M2, Sigma), Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HA (3F10, Roche Applied Science), ;-tubulin (Ab-1, Calbiochem), c-Jun (H-79, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c-Fos (sc-52, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ;3 (MCP257, Affiniti Research Products), ;7 (MCP72, Affiniti), Rpt6 (p45-110, Affiniti), and Rpn10 (S5a-18, Affiniti). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse, rabbit. or rat IgG were obtained from Amersham Biosciences.Immunoprecipitations—Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer, which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 10 ;l of agarose-immobilized anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) or anti-HA (Sigma) antibodies at 4 °C for 3 h. Resins were washed four times with 700 ;l of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 10 min in 1× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis.Pulse-Chase Analysis—HEK-293T cells were seeded on 6-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with the appropriate expression plasmids. After 24 h, cells were labeled metabolically for 1 h with 100 ;Ci of [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN) in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 4 mm l-glutamine. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were chased for the indicated intervals in complete medium. Harvested cells were then solubilized with lysis buffer that also contained 0.1% SDS and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The soluble fractions were incubated for 1 h with 2 ;g of anti-c-Myc antibody and adsorbed to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Band intensities were measured with scanning densitometry (Fluor-S MultiImager, Bio-Rad).Glutathione S-Transferase Pulldown Assay—GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). For in vitro translation, [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences)-labeled proteins were produced using the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). In vitro translated proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with GST or GST fusion protein in 700 ;l of GST-binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Beads were washed three times with GST-binding buffer, and then bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography.In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—HEK-293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3-His-c-Jun or pcDNA3-His-c-Fos, pcDNA3-HA-HBZ, and pcDNA3-FLAG-ubiquitin (Ub) in different combinations. After treatment with MG132 (20 ;m) for 12 h, cells were lysed in buffer A (8 m urea, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5)) and incubated with 20 ;l of Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed with buffer B (8 m urea, 50 mm imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl). The bound proteins were eluted with buffer C (8 m urea, 500 mm imidazole, 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5)) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis.Degradation Analysis in Temperature-sensitive ts20 Cells—ts20 cells in 10-cm plates were transfected with the appropriate expression plasmids and incubated for 12 h at 35 °C (permissive temperature). Cells were split into two dishes and incubated for an additional 12 h at 35 °C. Then, appropriate plates were moved to the restrictive temperature (39 °C). Cells were harvested after 24 h and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A human spleen cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain of pACT2 (Clontech) was screened against the bait protein, the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the HBZ N-terminal 120 amino acids (pGBT9-HBZ-N). pGBT9-HBZ-N and the cDNA library were co-introduced into the yeast cell line Y190 using the lithium acetate transformation method (27Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). The transformants were plated onto selective medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine, and containing 150 mm 3-aminotriazole to isolate clones with histidine prototrophy. Selected clones were assayed for another marker, ;-galactosidase activity, as described in the Clontech protocol. Plasmid DNA was extracted from positive clones and analyzed by partial DNA sequencing.Glycerol Density Gradient Analysis—HEK-293T cells transiently expressing HA-tagged HBZ were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to 10-40% (v/v) glycerol density gradient centrifugation in a Hitachi RPS40T rotor (22 h, 83,000 × g). The gradient was separated into 30 fractions from the bottom.Lentiviral Vector Construction and Transfection—The lentivirus-based transfection system was a generous gift from Dr. H. Miyoshi. To express short hairpin RNAs against HBZ, complementary DNA oligonucleotides were inserted into the lentiviral vector (pCS-RfA-EG) under control of the H1 promoter. The target sequence against HBZ was 5′-GCAGATTGCTGAGTATTTG-3′. We cotransfected 4.5 ;g of the above lentiviral vector (pCS-RfA-EG-shHBZ) with 3.5 ;g of pMDLg/pRRE and 1.5 ;g of pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev into packaging cells (293FT) using Lipofectamine 2000. After a 48-h incubation, the culture medium was harvested and concentrated 100- to 200-fold by ultrafiltration. The titer of concentrated virus was measured on 293T cells based on their green fluorescent protein expression. Cells were transfected at a multiplicity of infection of 30 in the presence of Polybrene (4 ;g/ml, Sigma). Cells were collected 7 days later, and green fluorescent protein expression was analyzed by FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences).RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—After 7 days of lentiviral infection, total RNA was extracted with Sepasol RNA I super reagent (Nacalai Tesque). We evaluated the relative expression of each mRNA by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR using a One-step RNA PCR kit (Takara). The following primers were used. HBZ: 5′-GAGAAGAAGGCCGCTGAC-3′ and 5′-TTATTGCAACCACATCGC-3′, c-Jun: 5′-GAACTGCACAGCCAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GGCGATTCTCTCCAGCTT-3′, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: 5′-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCGG-3′ and 5′-TGGAGGGATCTCGCTCCTGG-3′.RESULTSHBZ Promotes Proteasomal Degradation of c-Jun—We previously showed that HBZ heterodimerized with c-Jun via respective leucine-zipper domains and targeted c-Jun for proteasomal degradation (26Matsumoto J. Ohshima T. Isono O. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). When c-Jun and HBZ were ectopically coexpressed in cells, c-Jun expression was significantly reduced. The reduction in c-Jun protein levels by HBZ was prevented by treating with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, as confirmed in Fig. 1A. In addition, ectopically expressed HBZ reduced the half-life of endogenous c-Jun in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 1B). We next evaluated the effect of HBZ on c-Jun stability in HTLV-1-infected cells. We suppressed the HBZ gene in HTLV-1-infected C8166 cells by using lentivirus vector transcribing short hairpin RNAs against HBZ (Fig. 1C, upper panel). As shown in Fig. 1C (lower panel), HBZ knockdown prolonged the half-life of endogenous c-Jun in C8166 cells. These results indicate that HBZ regulates c-Jun stability by promoting its proteasomal degradation.HBZ Does Not Promote the Ubiquitination of c-Jun—Most proteasomal substrates are targeted for degradation by the conjugation of polyubiquitin chains (28Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The conjugation reaction is catalyzed by a variety of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Because c-Jun is also degraded by a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that is mediated by several E3 ubiquitin ligases (29Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhang Z. Dornan D. Arnott D. Deshaies R.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 2004; 303: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 30Nateri A.S. Riera-Sans L. Da Costa C. Behrens A. Science. 2004; 303: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), we speculated that HBZ acts as a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase. Therefore, we examined whether HBZ promotes polyubiquitination of c-Jun. Histidine-tagged c-Jun and epitope-tagged HBZ and ubiquitin were co-expressed in HEK-293T cells in different combinations. After purification with Ni-NTA beads, polyubiquitinated c-Jun species were specifically detected by immunoblotting. Interestingly, not only did we not detect an increase, but we also were unable to detect any ubiquitinated species of c-Jun in the presence of HBZ (Fig. 2A). This is not likely due to decreased c-Jun protein levels, because we also failed to detect any ubiquitinated c-Jun species in the presence of HBZ even after the treatment with MG132 (Fig. 2B). However, this abrogation of ubiquitination did not seem to be the result of a global inhibition of ubiquitination machinery, because HBZ did not alter the ubiquitination level of c-Fos (Fig. 2C), another AP-1 family member, which does not interact with HBZ (26Matsumoto J. Ohshima T. Isono O. Shimotohno K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Conceivably, HBZ promotes c-Jun degradation without promoting its ubiquitination.FIGURE 2HBZ does not promote the ubiquitination of c-Jun. A, HEK-293T cells were transfected with 2 ;g of pcDNA3-His-c-Jun, pcDNA3-FLAG-Ub, and pcDNA3-HA-HBZ as indicated. Following purification with Ni-NTA beads, bound proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis. B, HEK-293T cells were transfected as indicated in A. After 12 h, the cells were treated with MG132 for 12 h. Following Ni-NTA purification, bound proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis. C, HEK-293T cells were transfected with 2 ;g of pcDNA3-His-c-Fos, pcDNA3-FLAG-Ub, and pcDNA3-HA-HBZ as indicated. After 12 h, the cells were treated with MG132 for 12 h. Following Ni-NTA purification, bound proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ubiquitination Is Not Required for HBZ-mediated Proteasomal Degradation of c-Jun—We next determined the role of ubiquitination in HBZ-mediated c-Jun degradation. In the first approach, we constructed a c-Jun mutant (c-JunK/R) in which all lysine residues (potential sites of ubiquitin conjugation) were mutated to arginine. We confirmed that the c-JunK/R mutant was not ubiquitinated in cells (Fig. 3A, left panel). Wild-type c-Jun and the mutant were confirmed to associate with HBZ comparably (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A (right panel), the c-JunK/R mutant was degraded by HBZ as efficiently as wild-type c-Jun. This result led us to hypothesize that HBZ targets c-Jun for proteasomal degradation in a ubiquitin-independent manner.FIGURE 3HBZ promotes c-Jun degradation in a ubiquitin-independent manner. A, HBZ promotes the degradation of lysine-free c-Jun. Left panel: HEK-293T cells were transfected with 2 ;g of either pcDNA3-His-c-Jun or pcDNA3-His-c-JunK/R in the presence of pcDNA3-FLAG-Ub as indicated. After 12 h, the cells were treated with MG132 for 12 h. Following Ni-NTA purification, bound proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis. Right panel: HEK-293T cells were transfected with 0.5 ;g of either pcDNA3-HA-c-Jun or pcDNA3-HA-c-JunK/R and 3 ;g of either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-FLAG-HBZ. Cell lysates were immunoblotted using the antibodies indicated. B, HBZ-mediated degradation of c-Jun is not inhibited by a dominant-negative ubiquitin. HEK-293T cells were transfected with 0.3 ;g of pcDNA3-c-Jun-Myc together with 0.5 ;g of pcDNA3-HA-COP1 and 1.5 ;g of pcDNA3-HA-DET1, or 2 ;g of pcDNA3-HA-HBZ in the presence of 3 ;g of pcDNA3-FLAG-Ub or -Ub K48R. After 24 h, the cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 h and then chased for the indicated intervals. Labeled c-Jun was immunoprecipitated and resolved by SDS-PAGE. c-Jun levels were detected by autoradiography. The intensity of each band was quantified and listed below each panel. C, HBZ promotes c-Jun degradation in the absence of a functional ubiquitination system. ts-20 cells were transfected with 1 ;g of pcDNA3-FLAG-c-Jun in the presence of 2 ;g of pcDNA3-HA-COP1 and pcDNA3-HA-DET1 or 4 ;g of pcDNA3-HA-HBZ, as indicated. The cells were then split and incubated at 35 or 39 °C for an additional 24 h. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG or anti-;-tubulin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the second approach, we used a dominant-negative ubiquitin mutant (Ub-K48R) that bears a substitution of lysine 48 with arginine. Ub-K48R exerts a chain-terminating effect and blocks ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (31Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). In a pulse-chase analysis, the expression of Ub-K48R stabilized c-Jun (Fig. 3B, upper panel), because c-Jun is basally targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (32Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). COP1 and DET1, a ubiquitin ligase complex for c-Jun (29Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhang Z. Dornan D. Arnott D. Deshaies R.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 2004; 303: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), promoted c-Jun degradation in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Therefore, the expression of Ub-K48R blocked its degradation (Fig. 3B, middle panel). In contrast, HBZ-mediated degradation of c-Jun was not blocked by Ub-K48R expression (Fig. 3B, lower panel).Finally, we performed degradation experiments using the mouse ts20 cell line. These cells have a temperature-sensitive E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme that is inactivated at the restrictive temperature of 39 °C (33Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). As expected, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of c-Jun mediated by COP1/DET1 was blocked at 39 °C (Fig. 3C, left panel), whereas HBZ still promoted c-Jun degradation at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 3C, right panel). Taken together, these results suggest that HBZ promotes proteasomal degradation of c-Jun through a ubiquitin-independent mechanism.HBZ Promotes Degradation of Proteins That Bind Its bZIP Domain but Not Its N Terminus—We next examined the specificity of HBZ-mediated proteasomal degradation. In the first approach, we investigated whether HBZ promotes degradation of other bZIP proteins. HBZ has been shown to associate with JunB, JunD, and ATF4 via their bZIP domains (23Gaudray G. Gachon F. Basbous J. Biard-Piechaczyk M. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12813-12822Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 24Basbous J. Arpin C. Gaudray G. Piechaczyk M. Devaux C.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We found that HBZ also associates with ATF2 through its bZIP domain in vivo (Fig. 4A, lower panel). As shown in Fig. 4A (upper panel), HBZ promoted degradation of these bZIP-binding proteins, and degradation of these proteins were prevented by MG132 treatment (data not shown). On the other hand, HBZ failed to promote the degradation of CREB and ATF1. Recently, HBZ has been shown to interact with CREB and ATF1 via their bZIP domains in vivo and in vitro (34Lemasson I. Lewis M.R. Polakowski N. Hivin P. Cavanagh M.H. Thebault S. Barbeau B. Nyborg J.K. Mesnard J.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 1543-15"
https://openalex.org/W1963784088,"Bcl10 and MALT1 are essential mediators of NF-κB activation in response to the triggering of a diverse array of transmembrane receptors, including antigen receptors. Additionally, both proteins are translocation targets in MALT lymphoma. Thus, a detailed understanding of the interaction between these mediators is of considerable biological importance. Previous studies have indicated that a 13-amino acid region downstream of the Bcl10 caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is responsible for interacting with the immunoglobulin-like domains of MALT1. We now provide evidence that the death domain of MALT1 and the CARD of Bcl10 also contribute to Bcl10-MALT1 interactions. Although a direct interaction between the MALT1 death domain and Bcl10 cannot be detected via immunoprecipitation, FRET data strongly suggest that the death domain of MALT1 contributes significantly to the association between Bcl10 and MALT1 in T cells in vivo. Furthermore, analysis of point mutants of conserved residues of Bcl10 shows that the Bcl10 CARD is essential for interaction with the MALT1 N terminus. Mutations that disrupt proper folding of the Bcl10 CARD strongly impair Bcl10-MALT1 interactions. Molecular modeling and functional analyses of Bcl10 point mutants suggest that residues Asp80 and Glu84 of helix 5 of the Bcl10 CARD directly contact MALT1. Together, these data demonstrate that the association between Bcl10 and MALT1 involves a complex interaction between multiple protein domains. Moreover, the Bcl10-MALT1 interaction is the second reported example of interactions between a CARD and a non-CARD protein region, which suggests that many signaling cascades may utilize CARD interactions with non-CARD domains.

Thus, Bcl10 and MALT1 are essential for adaptive immune responses and are likely to play a significant role in the etiology and/or pathogenesis of MALT lymphoma. The antigen receptor to NF-κB signaling pathway involves a cascade of protein-protein interactions and protein modifications that ultimately result in phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitory binding partner of NF-κB, called IκB. This degradation event allows translocation of the heterodimeric NF-κB transcription factor from the cytosol to the nucleus (9Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar). Although some of the signaling intermediates utilized in this pathway, such as the trimeric IκB kinase (IKK) complex, are common to NF-κB signaling cascades that are coupled to other cellular receptors (e.g. Toll-like receptors of the innate immune system), the portion of the cascade upstream of the IKK complex is limited to specific ligand-triggered pathways, including the antigen receptor-directed NF-κB activation cascade (1Schulze-Luehrmann J.

Oligomerized MALT1, in conjunction with the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes UBC13 and MMS2, adds Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains to NEMO/IKKγ, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of IKKβ by the kinase TAK1 (15Sun L.

In lymphocytes, the N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of Bcl10 binds to the CARD of CARMA1, and this interaction is required for transduction of the NF-κB activating signal (18Egawa T.

A similar or identical CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1-mediated pathway appears to connect ITAM-coupled NK cell receptors to NF-κB activation (23Gross O. Grupp C. Steinberg C. Zimmermann S. Strasser D. Hannesschlager N. Reindl W. Jonsson H. Huo H. Littman D.R. Peschel C. Yokoyama W.M. Krug A. Ruland J. Blood,. 2008; 112: 2421-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Malarkannan S. Regunathan J. Chu H. Kutlesa S. Chen Y. Zeng H. Wen R. Wang D. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In myeloid cells, recent studies have shown that CARD9 functions as a surrogate for CARMA1 in connecting the dectin-1 receptor, CD16, TREM, and other ITAM-coupled myeloid receptors to Bcl10/MALT1 (25Gross O. Gewies A. Finger K. Schafer M. Sparwasser T. Peschel C. Forster I. Ruland J. Nature. 2006; 442: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 26Hara H. Ishihara C. Takeuchi A. Imanishi T.

Similarly, in non-immune system cells, certain G protein-coupled receptors are coupled to Bcl10/MALT1 via CARMA3 (27Klemm S. Zimmermann S. Peschel C. Mak T.W. Ruland J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28McAllister-Lucas L.M. Ruland J. Siu K. Jin X. Gu S. Kim D.S. Kuffa P. Kohrt D. Mak T.W. Nunez G. Lucas P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, many receptors are coupled to the Bcl10/MALT NF-κB activation module via an upstream activator that contacts Bcl10 via a CARD-CARD interaction. Recently, MALT1 has also been shown to mediate additional functions related to T cell activation, cleaving both the ubiquitin editing enzyme, A20, and the C terminus of Bcl10. These activities are dependent both on a functional MALT1 caspase-like domain and on TCR signals transmitted through CARMA1 and Bcl10. Evidence suggests that MALT1-mediated cleavage of A20, a negative modulator of NF-κB activation, further potentiates TCR-stimulated NF-κB activation (29Coornaert B. Baens M. Heyninck K. Bekaert T. Haegman M. Staal J. Sun L. Chen Z.J. Marynen P. Beyaert R. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In contrast, data suggest that MALT1 cleavage of the Bcl10 C terminus is not important for NF-κB activation, but rather facilitates β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin, perhaps via modification of integrin contacts with the cytoskeleton (30Rebeaud F. Hailfinger S. Posevitz-Fejfar A. Tapernoux M. Moser R. Rueda D. Gaide O. Guzzardi M. Iancu E.M. Rufer N. Fasel N. Thome M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The currently accepted model of Bcl10-MALT1 interaction is that the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains of MALT1 directly bind to Bcl10 through a 13-amino acid (aa) motif that is immediately downstream of the Bcl10 CARD. Deletion of this 13-aa domain disrupts the ability of Bcl10 both to activate NF-κB and to associate with MALT1 in immunoprecipitation assays (31Lucas P.C. Yonezumi M. Inohara N. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Abazeed M.E. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Seto M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19012-19019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Due to the critical nature of the Bcl10-MALT1 interaction in numerous pathways of NF-κB activation, we performed mutagenesis studies to further define the requirements for Bcl10 physical and functional interactions with MALT1. Deletion mutants of MALT1 analyzed by FRET strongly suggest that, in addition to the Ig-like domains, the death domain (DD) of MALT1 contributes significantly to the association between Bcl10 and MALT1 in vivo. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of the Bcl10 protein demonstrates that the region of Bcl10 that interacts with MALT1 is larger than previously reported, extending into the Bcl10 CARD. Thus, the MALT1 DD and Ig-like domains associate with the Bcl10 CARD and 13-aa MALT1 binding motif to stabilize the Bcl10-MALT1 complex. These results provide previously unknown molecular details concerning the interaction between Bcl10 and MALT1, and indicate that the physical interaction of these molecules is more complex than previously appreciated. Additionally, the Bcl10-MALT1 complex represents the second reported example of interactions between a CARD and a non-CARD protein region (32Nam Y.J. Mani K. Ashton A.W. Peng C.F. Krishnamurthy B. Hayakawa Y. Lee P. Korsmeyer S.J. Kitsis R.N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), suggesting that such CARD-non-CARD interactions may occur in many signaling pathways. Cells, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—D10 T cells and CH12 B cells were maintained as previously described (14Schaefer B.C. Kappler J.W. Kupfer A. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed by a modified calcium phosphate method (33Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). For luciferase assays, 1.2 × 105 HEK293T cells were plated per well in a 24-well plate. NF-κB activation was assessed as previously described by Lucas et al. (31Lucas P.C. Yonezumi M. Inohara N.

Luciferase assays were performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Mountain View, CA) at 48 h post-transfection, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. β-Galactosidase assays were performed using the β-Galactosidase Reporter Gene Activity Detection Kit (Sigma). Luciferase values for each sample were normalized to the corresponding β-galactosidase values, and reported as –fold induction relative to control cells transfected with reporter vectors only. Mutagenesis and Retroviral Infections—Clustal W alignments (34Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) were performed using the worldwide web server at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Deletion and point mutants of the Bcl10-GFP fusion protein were produced via PCR mutagenesis, using standard methodology. N-terminal FLAG- and C-terminal YFP-tagged deletions of the murine MALT1 cDNA were constructed as previously described (13Rossman J.S. Stoicheva N.G. Langel F.D. Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Schaefer B.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MALT1-DD-only contains MALT1 residues 2–131; MALT1–2xIg-only contains residues 132–327; the MALT1-ΔIg construct contains a deletion of residues 132–344; and the MALT1-ΔDD construct contains a deletion of residues 1–131. Other MALT1 deletions and the Bcl10-CFP construct were previously described (13Rossman J.S. Stoicheva N.G. Langel F.D. Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Schaefer B.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged CARMA1 cDNA was a gift from J. Pomerantz (Johns Hopkins University) and D. Baltimore (Caltech). The above constructs were cloned into the retroviral expression vectors, pENeo or pEhyg (35Schaefer B.C. Mitchell T.C. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 297: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Retroviral infection and selection of D10 T cells were as previously described (14Schaefer B.C. Kappler J.W. Kupfer A. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HA-Bcl10-GFP constructs were produced by cloning three repeats of the HA epitope tag immediately upstream of the Bcl10 open reading frame, and these gene fusions were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). FLAG-MALT1 deletion mutants and FLAG-CARMA1 were cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector. For each sample, 1.2 × 106 HEK293T cells were distributed between two wells of a 6-well plate. Following overnight growth, cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method, using 1.5 μg of pcDNA3–3xHA-Bcl10-GFP and 1.5 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG-construct (MALT1 deletion or CARMA1) per well. After 48 h, cells from the two wells were harvested and pooled; 1/6 of the cells were used for whole cell lysates (direct lysis and sonication in 1× Laemmli buffer). The remaining 5/6 of the cells were incubated in IP lysis buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.25 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C (14,000 × g) for 10 min. Supernatants were pre-cleared with 10 μl of Protein -G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C with rotation for 1 h, and then immunoprecipitated for 16 h with 2 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) (Sigma) at 4 °C with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were captured with 20 μl of Protein-G-Sepharose (1 h, 4 °C), and washed 3 times in 1 ml of IP lysis buffer. The samples were then boiled in 1× Laemmli buffer. The denatured immunoprecipitated proteins from ∼4 × 105 cell eq were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. HA-Bcl10-GFP was detected by Western blotting, using a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Whole cell lysates were probed with rabbit anti-HA or rabbit anti-FLAG to detect HA-Bcl10 or FLAG-MALT1/-CARMA1, respectively. Three-dimensional Modeling—The model for the CARD and minimal MALT1 binding region of murine Bcl10 (aa 13–119 of NCBI sequence AAH24379) was built using the three-dimensional structure of the CARD of RAIDD (Protein Data Bank ID 3CRD). 3CRD was selected at the template using PSI-BLAST (36Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) and PDB-BLAST on the basis of E value, which describes the likelihood that a sequence with a similar score will occur in the data base by chance. The query sequence was submitted to the 3DPSSM server (37Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar), which detects the protein folds against a data base of fold libraries from known protein structures independent of their sequence similarity with query sequence. 3DPSSM alignment results were used to align target and template sequences. The model was built using two different servers, SwissPDB Viewer (SPDBV) (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar) and Modeler 8v2 (39Sanchez R. Sali A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 143: 97-129PubMed Google Scholar). The alignment was constructed manually by loading the template and target sequences into the SPDBV alignment tool. The structurally corrected alignment was used to construct a theoretical three-dimensional model of the target in the SPDBV server and Modeler. These restraints were expressed as probability density functions, and the model with the smallest probability function was selected for further refinements. The stereochemical quality of the models was assessed by using PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Verify three-dimensional server (41Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar) was used to test the accuracy of the models using three-dimensional-one-dimensional profile score. We selected the model generated by Modeler, because most of the residues fall in the favored regions of the main Ramachandran plot (42Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar) in PROCHECK, and the three-dimensional-one-dimensional graph was found to be satisfactory. Microscopy and FRET Analysis—D10 T cells stably expressing Bcl10-GFP constructs were conjugated with conalbumin-primed CH12 B cells for 20 min at 37 °C, as previously described (14Schaefer B.C. Kappler J.W. Kupfer A. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Acquisition of images employed an Axiovert 200M microscope and ×63 plan-apochromat oil objective (Carl Zeiss Inc., Germany), connected to a TILL-Photonics epifluorescence imaging system for POLKADOTS analysis, or a Pascal confocal system (Carl Zeiss Inc., Germany) using a ×40 plan-apochromat oil objective (FRET analyses). Epifluorescence images were acquired as 15 μm z-stacks in steps of 0.3 μm, and image data were digitally deconvolved using a constrained-iterative algorithm (TILLvisION, TILL Photonics, Germany). Identification of cells with POLKADOTS and FRET calculations were performed as previously described (13Rossman J.S. Stoicheva N.G. Langel F.D. Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Schaefer B.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). FRET Analysis by FACS—D10 T cells were infected with retroviral vectors and drug selected to produce stable cell lines, as described above. All FRET constructs employed the cerulean variant of CFP (43Rizzo M.A. Springer G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) and citrine variant of YFP (44Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar) to prevent fluorescent protein dimerization. Negative controls for FRET consisted of cells expressing CFP alone, YFP alone, MALT1-ΔC-CFP alone, Bcl10-WT-YFP alone, and co-expressed CFP+YFP (unlinked). A fused CFP-YFP construct, joined by the linker GGAGSIDGSGRELGR, was used as a FRET positive control, and this construct was nucleoporated into D10 T cells to avoid reverse transcription-mediated recombination between the fluorescent proteins (46Li T. Zhang J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7646-7650Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry FRET analysis was performed as described (47Chan F.K. Siegel R.M. Zacharias D. Swofford R.

Y., and Lenardo, M. J. (2000) Science's STKE 2000, PL1Google Scholar), with the following exceptions. The 405 and 488 laser lines of a BD Biosciences LSRII were used to excite CFP and YFP, respectively. A 450/50 filter was used for CFP detection and a 585/42 filter was used for detection of the YFP and FRET signals. Compensations in the range of 1.0–1.2 and 80–90% were used for FRET-YFP and FRET-CFP, respectively. For creation of the FRET channel histograms, cells co-expressing MALT1-ΔC and Bcl10-YFP constructs were gated on the live cell population (defined by forward and side scatter parameters) and on a population defined by the upper and lower limits of YFP fluorescence for Bcl10-WT. Each control cell line was gated on live cells and the major fluorescent population. FRET Analysis by FLIM—D10 T cell lines were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, and fluorescence lifetime images were collected with a LIFA frequency domain FLIM system (Lambert Instruments, The Netherlands) attached to an Olympus IX71 epifluorescence microscope, employing a ×60 1.45 NA objective. Illumination was provided by a 443-nm modulated LED, and 12-phase step images (40 MHz frequency) were acquired with a modulated ICCD (intensified charge-coupled device) camera. Donor emission images were collected through a CFP filter. For each cell line, the fluorescent lifetimes of 20–70 cells were measured and averaged. Lifetime values were used to calculate FRET efficiencies employing the calculation tool in LI-FLIM software (version 1.2.2; Lambert Instruments, The Netherlands). For statistical analyses, p values were calculated by paired t-tests comparing FRET efficiencies from cell lines expressing each Bcl10 mutant versus the cell line expressing Bcl10-WT.

To confirm and extend these previous studies, we made several deletion mutants of MALT1 and Bcl10 (Fig. 1, A and B). Various combinations of these mutants were co-transfected into HEK293T cells, and immunoprecipitation (IP) analyses were performed, using anti-FLAG to immunoprecipitate the MALT1 constructs (Fig. 1C). Consistent with previous studies (31Lucas P.C. Yonezumi M. Inohara N. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Abazeed M.E. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Seto M. Nunez G. J. Biol.

In this study, the interaction of HA with the Link module from TSG-6 (Link_TSG6) and G1 domain of aggrecan (G1), were investigated by a biophysical analysis of translational diffusion in dilute solution using confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (confocal FRAP). Both Link_TSG6 and G1 were shown to bind to polymeric HA and these interactions could be competed with HA8 and HA10 oligosaccharides, respectively. Equilibrium experiments showed that the binding affinity of Link_TSG6 to HA was maximal at pH 6.0, and reduced dramatically above and below this pH. In contrast, G1 had maximum binding at pH 7.0–8.0 and moderate to strong binding affinity over a much broader pH range (5.5–8.0). The KD determined for Link_TSG6 binding to HA showed a 100-fold increase in binding affinity between pH 7.4 and 6.0, whereas G1 showed a 75-fold decrease in binding affinity over the same pH range. The sharp difference observed in their pH binding suggests that pH controls the physiological function of TSG-6, with a low affinity for HA at neutral pH, but with increased affinity as the pH falls below pH 7. TSG-6 and aggrecan interact with HA through structurally homologous domains and the difference in pH-dependent binding can be understood in terms of differences in the presence and topographical distribution of key regulatory amino acids in Link_TSG6 and in the related tandem Link domains in aggrecan G1.

Fawcett J.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 501: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan of articular cartilage and consists of a protein core (225 kDa), to which are attached >100 chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate chains (7Hardingham T.E.

It binds to HA via its N-terminal G1 domain, where this interaction is stabilized by cartilage link protein (11Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J.

The formation of aggregates and their immobilization within the fibrillar collagen network of the ECM is responsible for the load-bearing properties of articular cartilage (6Hardingham T.E. Muir H. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 279: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 14Han L. Dean D. Mao P. Ortiz C. Grodzinsky A.J. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: L23-L25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Both aggrecan and cartilage link protein contain tandem pairs of Link modules within their HA-binding domains and it is these that mediate their highly specific binding to HA (3Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4585-4588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar); this type of module is found in a family of hyaladherins. TSG-6, an HA-binding protein associated with inflammation (15Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 16Kohda D. Morton C.J.

Day A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1863-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar)). TSG-6 is expressed in human cartilage (and synovium) during arthritis (18Bayliss M.T. Howat S.L.T. Dudhia J.

Previously we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the TSG-6 Link module by both NMR spectroscopy (16Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagakai F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J.

Noble M.E.M. Day A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 669-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which has defined the canonical fold for this type of domain. Determination of the structure of Link_TSG6 in the presence of an HA octasaccharide (HA8) has allowed us to elucidate the bound conformation for this protein (27Blundell C.D. Mahoney D.J. Almond A. DeAngelis P.L. Kahmann J.D. Teriete P. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49261-49270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and to model the HA·TSG-6 complex and other members of the Link module superfamily (29Blundell C.D.

With cartilage link protein and aggrecan, a speculative model was generated of how these molecules may associate with HA to form a super-helical structure (29Blundell C.D. Almond A. Mahoney D.J. DeAngelis P.L. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18189-18201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that the binding of HA to the TSG-6 Link module is optimal at pH 5.5–6.0 with a major decrease in binding above or below this pH (30Parkar A.A. Kahmann J.D. Howat S.L.T. Bayliss M.T. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This unusual pH dependence appeared to be in marked contrast to that for the G1 domain of aggrecan, where the highest affinity was reported at neutral pH 7.0–8.0 (31Hardingham T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1981; 9: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that the unusual pH dependence we reported for the HA–Link_TSG6 interaction may have resulted from an artifact of the solid phase assay used in the analysis (32Wisniewski H.G. Snitkin E.S. Mindrescu C. Sweet M.H. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14476-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In recent work, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to show that the Link_TSG6 had a higher affinity at pH 6.0 compared with pH 7.5 for short oligosaccharides of HA in solution phase and a structural basis for the pH dependence was identified using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, NMR and ITC (33Blundell C.D. Mahoney D.J. Cordell M.R. Almond A. Kahmann J.D. Perczel A. Taylor J.D. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12976-12988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the differences in affinity determined by ITC for the Link_TSG6–HA interactions at pH 6.0 and 7.5 were fairly modest (∼2.5- and ∼7-fold higher for HA8 and HA20, respectively (33Blundell C.D. Mahoney D.J. Cordell M.R. Almond A. Kahmann J.D. Perczel A. Taylor J.D. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12976-12988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)) when compared with the dramatic changes apparent in the solid phase assays (30Parkar A.A. Kahmann J.D. Howat S.L.T. Bayliss M.T. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As a large change in HA binding between pH 6.0 and 7.5 could have a major effect on the physiological function of TSG-6, it was important to gain more evidence of the pH dependence of the binding of Link_TSG6 to HA in solution, in particular, for polymeric HA, which has not been investigated to date. In this study we used confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (confocal FRAP) to characterize more fully the HA binding of the TSG-6 Link module and to compare it with the binding properties of the structurally related G1 domain of aggrecan. This technique determines the translational diffusion coefficients of fluorescently tagged molecules and provides a powerful method for characterizing the binding interactions of macromolecules in free solution (34Gribbon P. Hardingham T.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1032-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is an equilibrium method and we have previously used it to characterize the interaction of aggrecan with HA (35Gribbon P. Heng B.C. Hardingham T.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 487-494PubMed Google Scholar). It thus provided an ideal experimental system to analyze the interaction of the TSG-6 Link module with polymeric HA. Materials—Unless otherwise stated, all reagents, chemicals, and consumables were obtained from Sigma. HA (800 kDa) extracted from rooster comb was a kind gift from Seikagaku Corporation Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of Hyaluronan Oligosaccharides—HA (800 kDa) was digested by bovine testicular hyaluronidase (0.01 unit/mg) in sodium acetate buffer (0.2 m, pH 5.0) for 24 h at 37 °C and purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Bio-Rad Bio-Gel P-30 column in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C. The eluate was monitored at 206 nm and the oligosaccharide peaks were pooled separately, dialyzed against water, freeze-dried, and then rerun on the same column, to yield purified fractions of HA oligosaccharides (4- to 14-mers) as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (36Cowman M.K. Cozart D. Nakanishi K. Balazs E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Preparation of Link_TSG6 and G1-Aggrecan—Recombinant TSG-6 Link module (Link_TSG6) was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified to homogeneity as described previously (37Day A.J. Aplin R.T. Willis A.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 38Kahmann J.D. Koruth R. Day A.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The G1 domain of aggrecan (G1) (65 kDa) was prepared from porcine cartilage as previously described and migrated on SDS-PAGE as a single protein band (39Bonnet F. Dunham D.G. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) Labeling of Proteins—To label the Link_TSG6 and the G1 domain of aggrecan with FITC, solutions at 0.2 mg/ml in bicarbonate buffer (0.05 m, pH9) (1 ml) were mixed with FITC (20 μl of 1 mg/ml) (40Smedsrod B. Pertoft H. Eggertsen G. Sundstrom C. Cell Tissue Res. 1985; 241: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and incubated for 2 h at 4°C, before running on a 5-ml Hi-Trap (GE Healthcare) desalting column. Fractions (250 μl) collected containing the FITC-labeled protein were quantitated by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma). For both the G1 and Link_TSG6 the labeling was ∼2–3 FITC mol/mol, based on the fluorescence of a known concentration of protein in solution and free FITC standard. This level of FITC labeling was sufficient to obtain a strong signal for confocal FRAP bleach recovery experiments at the protein concentrations used and over the pH range investigated. Preparation of Solutions for Confocal FRAP—To investigate the binding of Link_TSG6 to HA (800 kDa) under different pH conditions, solutions containing mixtures of FITC-Link_TSG6 (31 μg/ml) with HA (1600 μg/ml HA) were prepared in either acetate or phosphate buffers such that all experiments were performed at the same overall ionic strength (i.e. [100 mm Na+]; 100 mm sodium acetate buffer was used for pH 4.0–6.0, whereas 50 mm phosphate buffer was employed for pH 6.0–8.0. The dissociation constant (KD) for Link_TSG6 binding to HA at pH 6.0 was determined using FITC-Link_TSG6 (50 μg/ml) and HA (2.5–500 μg/ml) equilibrated in 44 mm NaH2PO4, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 44 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. For the determination of the KD at pH 7.4, FITC-Link_TSG6 (50 μg/ml) and HA (10–1500 μg/ml) were equilibrated in 9 mm NaH2PO4, 41 mm Na2HPO4, 9 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Competition experiments contained FITC-Link_TSG6 (40 μg/ml) and 800-kDa HA (100 μg/ml), together with varying concentrations of HA decasaccharide (HA10) (0–400 μg/ml) in the pH 6.0 buffer as above. The minimum size of HA oligomer required for binding to Link_TSG6 was determined using FITC-Link_TSG6 (40 μg/ml, 4 μm) and HA (50 μg/ml), together with HA oligosaccharides of different sizes (4- to 14-mer; all at 21 μm final concentration) in the pH 6.0 buffer (as above). Binding of G1 domain to HA was investigated at the same ionic strength (i.e. 100 mm Na+) as for Link_TSG6 above. The affinity of G1-HA binding was determined at different pH using mixtures of FITC-G1 (100 μg/ml) and HA (800 kDa, 100 μg/ml), prepared in citrate buffers (containing 100 mm Na+ ion) at pH values ranging from pH 3.5 to 8.0. To determine the KD of G1 binding to HA at pH 6.0, FITC-G1 (80 μg/ml) with varying concentrations of HA (800 kDa; 50–400 μg/ml) were equilibrated in 44 mm NaH2PO4, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 44 mm NaCl. For the determination of KD at pH 7.4, FITC-G1 (80 μg/ml) with HA (5–200 μg/ml) was equilibrated in 9 mm NaH2PO4, 41 mm Na2HPO4, 9 mm NaCl. Competition experiments were with mixtures of FITC-G1 (80 μg/ml) and HA (100 μg/ml), together with HA10 (0–400 μg/ml) in the pH 7.4 buffer. The minimum size of HA oligomer required for binding to the G1 domain was determined with FITC-G1 (80 μg/ml 1.2 μm) and HA (25 μg/ml), together with HA oligosaccharides of different sizes (HA4–HA14) (all at 21 μm) in the pH 7.4 buffer (as above). Diffusion Measurements by Confocal FRAP—The confocal FRAP instrumentation and variance recovery analysis were as described previously (34Gribbon P. Hardingham T.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1032-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35Gribbon P. Heng B.C. Hardingham T.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 487-494PubMed Google Scholar, 41Gribbon P. Heng B.C. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Solutions for equilibrium measurements were pre-mixed and left overnight at 4 °C. Samples for analysis (30 μl) were sealed in cavity slides and further equilibrated for 30 min at 37 °C on a heated microscope stage (PE-60, Linkam Instruments, Tadworth, UK). Sample bleaching of FITC and recovery fluorescence monitoring was with an argon ion laser (100 milliwatts) in a Bio-Rad MRC-1000 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Lateral self- and tracer-diffusion coefficients (D) were calculated from the time dependence of plots of the second moment of the radially averaged distribution of bleached fluorophores (42Kubitscheck U. Wedekind P. Peters R. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 948-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For all samples the fluorescence recovery showed the expected linear dependence of the second moment of the radial distribution of bleached fluorophore with time and the kinetics were consistent with first-order behavior of a single component. All experimental data are based on the results from at least 5 replicate bleaches and are reported as the mean ± S.D. Data Analysis of Binding Studies—Because of the large difference in the free diffusion of HA (800 kDa) and the FITC-Link_TSG6 (∼10 kDa) and FITC-G1 (∼65 kDa)), the binding of these proteins results in a large decrease in their apparent diffusion coefficients as their diffusion becomes the same as the HA. The translational diffusion coefficient determined by confocal FRAP is a long time-based analysis (over many seconds). Thus, if there is a fast exchange between bound and unbound forms (i.e. microseconds), then what is measured by confocal FRAP is an “average” diffusion coefficient of the bound and unbound fractions. The diffusion coefficient determined by the method thus provides a measure of the fractions of ligand that are bound and free (Equation 1). Fbound=Daverage−DfreeDbound−Dfree (Eq. 1) Where Daverage is the measured diffusion, Dfree is the free diffusion coefficient of FITC-protein, Dbound is the diffusion coefficient of HA, and Fbound is the fraction of FITC-protein bound to HA. Values of the association (KA) and dissociation (KD) constants can then be calculated by measuring the fractions of FITC-protein bound at varying HA concentrations and using a Scatchard (Equation 2) or reverse Scatchard (Equation 3) analysis (35Gribbon P. Heng B.C. Hardingham T.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 487-494PubMed Google Scholar). Fbound[HA] bs=nKD−FboundKD (Eq. 2) 1Fbound=1n+KDn[HA] bs (Eq. 3) Where [HA]bs is the molarity of potential binding sites on HA, and n is the moles of FITC-protein bound per mol of binding site. Based on experimental data from this study, a 10-mer binding site was assumed for FITC-Link_TSG6, whereas a 12-mer binding site was assumed for FITC-G1. Effect of pH on the Binding of the TSG-6 Link Module to HA—To investigate the binding of FITC-Link_TSG6 to polymeric HA in solution between pH 4.0 and 8.0 we used confocal FRAP to determine the translational diffusion coefficient. We had previously shown that the translational diffusion of HA was unchanged between pH 4.0 and 8.0 (41Gribbon P. Heng B.C. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 43Gribbon P. Heng B.C. Hardingham T.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2210-2216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The binding of FITC-Link_TSG6 to polymeric HA was thus easily detected, as the lateral translational free diffusion coefficient (Do) of HA was ∼10-fold less than that for FITC-Link_TSG6 and D0 of FITC-Link_TSG6 (∼10 kDa) (1.25 × 10–6 cm2 s–1) was similar at pH 6.0 and 7.4 and independent of concentration up to 100 μg/ml (data not shown). In the presence of HA (Fig. 1) the diffusion coefficient of FITC-Link_TSG6 was dramatically reduced and the pH profile suggested maximal binding to HA at pH 6.0. On the basis of the results at each pH, the fraction of FITC-Link_TSG6 bound to HA (Fig. 1) was calculated (Equation 1). The experiment was carried out with a large excess of HA and from the concentration of HA and FITC-Link_TSG6 the maximum binding was 1.6 Link_TSG6 molecules per HA chain (at pH 6.0). As the binding of Link_TSG6 to HA in this experiment would increase by only 2% the mass of the HA-FITC-Link_TSG6 complex, this was unlikely to have any significant effect on the diffusion coefficient of HA. With this assumption it was possible to estimate (using Equation 4) the KD for the binding of Link_TSG6 with HA at different pH values as shown in Equation 4. KD=Funbound[HA](1−Funbound) (Eq. 4) Where Funbound is the fraction of FITC-Link_TSG6 that is unbound, and [HA] is the concentration of the binding sites on HA. Estimates of the KD at different pH showed there was maximal binding of Link_TSG6 to HA at pH 6.0 with much lower affinities both above and below this pH (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Effect of pH on the affinity of binding of Link_TSG6 and G1 to HA.

At pH 6.0 and 7.4, the lateral diffusion coefficient of FITC-Link_TSG6 decreased as the concentration of HA increased and from these results the fraction bound was determined at each HA concentration (Fig. 4) and the results were analyzed by Scatchard analysis (Fig. 3, B and C). This showed a much stronger binding affinity of Link_TSG6 to HA at the pH 6.0 than at pH 7.4, with KD values of 3.0 × 10–7 and 3.0 × 10–5 m, respectively. The TSG-6 Link module thus had a 100-fold higher affinity for HA at pH 6.0 compared with pH 7.4 under the conditions tested in this solution phase analysis. In the Scatchard analysis it was assumed that Link_TSG6 binds to a HA10, because with this as the basis for representing HA concentration, the calculated stiochiometry of binding at both pH values was 1:1 (1.00 and 0.97 at pH 6.0 and 7.4, respectively). This was also guided by our previous studies on the stoichiometry of the Link_TSG6-HA interaction and the finding that HA20 is the minimum length of oligomer that binds 2 Link_TSG6 molecules (27Blundell C.D.

The results showed that an HA8 was the shortest to give strong competition, although there was a small increase with the longer oligosaccharides. This result was consistent with our previous studies using ITC (27Blundell C.D. Mahoney D.J. Almond A. DeAngelis P.L. Kahmann J.D. Teriete P. Pickford A.R. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49261-49270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because TSG-6 also binds to C4S (44Parkar A.A. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), similar competition experiments were conducted with C4S oligosaccharides and indicated that C4S10 was the minimum length that could compete strongly for HA binding (see supplemental Fig. S1). To compare the affinity of Link_TSG6 binding to high molecular mass HA (polyvalent) and an HA oligosaccharide (monovalent), the concentration dependence of competition by HA10 (∼2 kDa) for the interaction of FITC-Link_TSG6 with polymeric HA was determined at pH 6.0."
https://openalex.org/W2003406218,"Follicular dendritic cell-secreted protein (FDC-SP) is a small secretory protein having structural similarities to statherin, a protein in saliva thought to play a role in calcium retention in saliva. In contrast, FDC-SP is thought to play a role in the immune system associated with germinal centers. We report here the very specific expression of FDC-SP in junctional epithelium at the gingival crevice. This region is very important for the host defense against pathogens and for periodontal protection. To be able to better understand the function of FDC-SP, we developed a novel gene expression system that exploited gene trapping and site-specific gene integration to introduce the protein into a mammalian cell culture system. Using this system we were able to express FDC-SP as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein in an osteogenic progenitor cell line with long term stability, which we then used to find that the fusion protein specifically adsorbs onto mineral deposits and the surface of hydroxyapatite particles exogenously added to the culture. This adsorption was highly dependent on the structural integrity of FDC-SP. These results suggest that FDC-SP may play an important role, adsorbing onto the surface of cementum and alveolar bone adjacent to periodontal ligament and onto tooth surface at the gingival crevice.

FDC-SP 2The abbreviations used are: FDC-SP, follicular dendritic cell-secreted protein; 5′-RACE, 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside; FRT, FLP recombination target; GFP, a green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is a small secretory protein that was originally identified in primary follicular dendritic cells isolated from human tonsils (1Marshall A.J. Du Q. Draves K.E. Shikishima Y. HayGlass K.T. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2381-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and was implicated in modulation of B cell activity (2Al-Alwan M. Du Q. Hou S. Nashed B. Fan Y. Yang X. Marshall A.J. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7859-7867Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that FDC-SP is expressed specifically in periodontal ligament and parotid gland and has molecular properties similar to those of statherin, a protein in saliva thought to function in preventing calcium precipitation (3Nakamura S. Terashima T. Yoshida T. Iseki S. Takano Y. Ishikawa I. Shinomura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both molecules are small in size (68 and 43 residues for mature human FDC-SP and statherin, respectively) and have a proline-rich region in their C-terminal half. In addition, these regions show a high degree of hydrophobicity in contrast to their N-terminal hydrophilic regions. Such structural similarities strongly suggested that additional roles for FDC-SP exist and that additional experiments looking for functional similarities between FDC-SP and statherin would be very informative. Statherin is a multifunctional molecule secreted from parotid and submandibular gland (4Schenkels L.C. Veerman E.C. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It has a significant affinity for calcium phosphate precipitates, including hydroxyapatite, and is present as an enamel pellicle protein within the oral cavity (5Raj P.A. Johnsson M. Levine M.J. Nancollas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5968-5976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statherin also contains sites for the adhesion of bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus mutans to the tooth surface (6Amano A. Kataoka K. Raj P.A. Genco R.J. Shizukuishi S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4249-4254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dodds M.W.J. Johnson D.A. Yeh C. J. Dent. 2005; 33: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), and these sites are thought to be a feature that the microorganisms have exploited for biofilm development (8Niemi L.D. Johansson L. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be significant to determine whether FDC-SP has a similar activity to statherin. However, a major obstacle in the functional analysis of FDC-SP is that only a small amount of protein can be obtained from tissues such as periodontal ligament and parotid gland. To overcome this problem, the expression of a cDNA encoding FDC-SP in mammalian cells was undertaken. Many expression vectors for mammalian cells are now available, but they do not always work well in any cell type, especially for long term culture in vitro. The search for a good vector is time-consuming and laborious. Fortunately, we had previously developed a gene trap screening method that showed that cells expressing a reporter gene with unlimited long term stability could be easily and consistently obtained (9Shirasawa S. Yoshimi M. Kamochi H. Muneta T. Kimura J.H. Höök M. Shinomura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We show here that we can replace the reporter gene with FDC-SP, enabling us to express it in relatively large amounts and with long term stability. We also report here the results of using this system to conduct a functional analysis of FDC-SP. Tissue Preparation and in Situ Hybridization—Four-week-old mice (Crj: CD-1 (ICR), Charles River Japan, Ltd., Yokohama, Japan) were used for in situ hybridization analyses. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Committee of Animal Care and Use at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University, and were performed in conformance with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation at the institution. Mice were anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg). Mandibles were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 24 h and then decalcified, en bloc, in 10% EDTA, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 2 weeks. The tissues were then equilibrated in 25% sucrose, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Tokyo, Japan), and quick-frozen at dry ice temperature. Preparation of frozen sections and in situ hybridization were performed according to the method we described previously (3Nakamura S. Terashima T. Yoshida T. Iseki S. Takano Y. Ishikawa I. Shinomura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were treated with proteinase K, prehybridized, and then hybridized overnight at 70 °C with the specific RNA probes as follows: the purified mouse FDC-SP cDNA was cloned into pGEM-3Zf(-) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and then sense and antisense RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription of the plasmid templates using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After hybridization, signals were visualized with a DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Cell Cultures—The cell line Kusa-A1 used in this study was an established mesenchymal stem cell line derived from the C3H/He mouse strain (10Umezawa A. Maruyama T. Segawa K. Shadduck R.K. Waheed A. Hata J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in αMEM10 (α-modified minimum essential medium supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). For induction of osteogenic differentiation, the cells were cultured in αMEM10 until confluent, and then the culture medium was replaced with αMEM10 containing 0.2 mm ascorbic acid and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). To verify mineral deposition, the cultures were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin (Wako Pure Chemical) and stained with von Kossa's method or with 1% Alizarin Red S at pH 6.4 for 5 min. Von Kossa's staining was performed as follows. Formalin-fixed cultures were rinsed with distilled water, and then incubated with an aqueous solution of 5% silver nitrate for 1 h at room temperature until they took on a dark brown color. Following a rinse with distilled water, the cultures were incubated in 5% sodium thiosulfate solution for 5 min. After staining, the cultures were rinsed with distilled water, and were then photographed. In some experiments, we added sterilized Bio-Gel HT hydroxyapatite particles (Bio-Rad) into the culture of Kusa-A1 cells to serve as markers to allow the identification of the exact location of mineral deposits produced by the cultures by microscopy as the added particles were visible both before and after Alizarin Red staining. The particles were fixed onto the cell layer within hours. Construction of Vectors for Trap-In Gene Expression System—A promoter trap vector prvPtrap (Fig. 2) was constructed by replacing the sequence encoding the rat CD4 transmembrane domain and a partial sequence of β-galactosidase gene of prvSStrap vector (9Shirasawa S. Yoshimi M. Kamochi H. Muneta T. Kimura J.H. Höök M. Shinomura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with the chemically synthesized FLP recombination target sequence (FRT) and a 2.1-kb DNA fragment encoding translational start site of β-galactosidase excised with HindIII and SacI from pβgal-Basic (Clontech). After ligation, the nucleotide sequences around the junctions of each DNA fragment were confirmed by direct sequencing with the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To produce a recombination insertion vector pInSRT (Fig. 2), a 2-kb DNA fragment containing the internal ribosome entry site, the puromycin phosphotransferase gene, and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal was cleaved from expression plasmid pCAGGS-FLPe (Gene Bridges GmbH, Dresden, Germany) with EcoRI and PstI. The resultant fragment was then cloned with the synthesized FRT sequence into a cloning vector pGEM3Zf(-) (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequences of the vectors prvPtrap and pInSRT have been submitted to the DDBJ under accession numbers AB375112 and AB375113, respectively. Retrovirus Production and Infection—For the production of infectious retrovirus, prvPtrap was linearized by digestion with XmnI, and the resultant vector DNA was co-transfected into the retrovirus packaging cell line PT67 (Clontech) with the neomycin phosphotransferase expression vector pSTneoB as described previously (9Shirasawa S. Yoshimi M. Kamochi H. Muneta T. Kimura J.H. Höök M. Shinomura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After selection with G418 (Calbiochem), retroviral producer cell lines were isolated. Virus titers were assayed on Kusa-A1 cells with hygromycin selection. In prvPtrap vector, the fusion gene encoding β-galactosidase and hygromycin phosphotransferase (βgyg) does not have its own promoter; therefore, the appearance of hygromycin-resistant colonies indicated the results of the efficient trapping of endogenous promoter. In our expression system, a single insert per cell facilitated the direct comparison of gene expressions among different genes without regard to chromosome positional effects as described in the text. To achieve this, viral infections were performed at a low multiplicity of infection to restrict transfections to single integrations as reported previously (9Shirasawa S. Yoshimi M. Kamochi H. Muneta T. Kimura J.H. Höök M. Shinomura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Characterization of Stable Transformants Resulting from Retrovirus Infection—To recover and identify trapped genes, rapid amplification of the 5′ end of the cDNA (5′ RACE) was performed using the 5′ RACE system (Invitrogen) as described previously (9Shirasawa S. Yoshimi M. Kamochi H. Muneta T. Kimura J.H. Höök M. Shinomura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from hygromycin-resistant clones grown on a 100-mm tissue culture plate using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA using a β-galactosidase-specific primer lacZ (R1), 5′-CGCATCGTAACCGTGCATCTGCCAGT-3′. After cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification of target cDNA was accomplished using a nested primer SSRT-1, 5′-TCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGG-3′, and AAP primer (Invitrogen) first, and then using a Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase-specific primer ALDH (R1), 5′-GAGCAGCTCCTTGCTGGTGTCCAGAC-3′, and AUAP primer (Invitrogen). PCR products were then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and were prepared for sequencing with the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) using ALDH (R2), 5′-GCTTTAGCAGGCTCTTTCGATCC-3′, as a primer. The reaction products were then run on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). To evaluate the promoter activity of trapped genes, hygromycin-resistant clones were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal) (Wako Pure Chemical), following the procedure described previously (9Shirasawa S. Yoshimi M. Kamochi H. Muneta T. Kimura J.H. Höök M. Shinomura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed for 15 min with 1% glutaraldehyde, and rinsed again with PBS before staining with X-gal for 3 h at 37 °C. Expression Constructs—A cDNA encoding a green fluorescent protein (GFP) was prepared from plasmid vector pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) by digestion with BamHI and NotI. A human FDC-SP cDNA encoding the full coding region was isolated from the subtractive cDNA library of a human periodontal ligament as described previously (3Nakamura S. Terashima T. Yoshida T. Iseki S. Takano Y. Ishikawa I. Shinomura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The resultant fragments were then cloned into the pInSRT vector separately for generating pInSRT-GFP and pInSRT-hFDC.SP. For the expression of GFP and human FDC-SP fusion protein, GFP-hFDC.SP as a secretory protein, we generated a plasmid vector pInSRT-GFPhFDC.SP by ligating the following DNA fragments step by step in pInSRT vector: 1) a small fragment containing the signal sequence of human PG-M/versican was cleaved from plasmid pRc/RSV-hM(V3) (11Isogai Z. Shinomura T. Yamakawa N. Takeuchi J. Tsuji T. Heinegård D. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3902-3908PubMed Google Scholar) with SalI and Age I; 2) 0.7-kb DNA fragment encoding GFP from pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) was excised with AgeI and BsrGI; 3) the 0.24-kb DNA fragment encoding human FDC-SP without signal sequence was amplified from the cDNA described above by PCR using specific primers 5′-CGGGATCCCCAGTCTCTCAAGACC-3′ and 5′-ACGGATCCTTCTTGTTTACTTTTC-3′. After construction of the vector, the nucleotide sequences around the junction of each DNA fragment were confirmed by direct sequencing with a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequence of pInSRT-GFPhFDC.SP has been submitted to the DDBJ under accession number AB375115. To identify the functional domains of human FDC-SP molecule, we have generated a single amino acid substitution construct and two different cDNA constructs with deletions within the C-terminal domain (Fig. 6a). The former construct was generated using GeneTailor™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). The latter constructs were amplified from pInSRT-GFPhFDC.SP by PCR using a common forward primer, 5′-GATCACATGGTCCTGCTGGAGTTC-3′, and two different reverse primers, 5′-GCGAATTCAAGGAAGGGGAGTTGTAGGGG-3′ and 5′-GCGAATTCAAGGGGCAGATTCAGGTATTG-3′. The amplified DNA fragments were then digested with BsrGI and EcoRI, and the resultant fragments were cloned into the vector, pInSRT-GFPhFDC.SP previously digested with BsrGI and EcoRI. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analyses were performed with a monoclonal antibody against GFP protein (Wako Pure Chemical) and with a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognized human FDC-SP. The latter antibody was raised in a rabbit after immunization with a synthetic peptide (FPVSQDQEREKRSISD) derived from the hydrophilic region of human FDC-SP (3Nakamura S. Terashima T. Yoshida T. Iseki S. Takano Y. Ishikawa I. Shinomura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as described previously (12Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Kusa-A1(H2) cells were used to express either intact GFP-hFDC.SP or each of the four human FDC-SP constructs described above. The cells were cultured in αMEM containing 10% serum until confluent. After rinsing thoroughly with PBS, the cells were then cultured in serum-free αMEM for further 24 h, and the conditioned medium was collected. The medium from each construct was then concentrated by Centricon YM-30 (Millipore) filtration, and the concentrated samples were denatured in 2% SDS, 65 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.13 m dithiothreitol by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. The resultant samples were then subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE, and proteins in the gel were then blotted onto a HyBond N membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). After blotting, the membrane was stained with the specific antibody described above. Expression of FDC-SP in Oral Tissues—We previously reported that oral tissues such as periodontal ligament and parotid gland express the follicular dendritic cell-secreted protein FDC-SP (3Nakamura S. Terashima T. Yoshida T. Iseki S. Takano Y. Ishikawa I. Shinomura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our subsequent in situ hybridization analysis revealed that FDC-SP is locally and strongly expressed in the junctional epithelium adjacent to the gingival crevice (Fig. 1). This region is very important for the attachment of gingiva to the enamel surface and as a host defense against pathogens and clinically for periodontal protection (13Schroeder H.E. Listgarten M.A. Periodontol. 2000. 1997; 13: 91-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular structure of FDC-SP shows some similarity to that of statherin which has a binding affinity for hydroxyapatite (14Goobes G. Goobes R. Schueler-Furman O. Baker D. Stayton P. Drobny G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16083-16088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and for bacteria (7Dodds M.W.J. Johnson D.A. Yeh C. J. Dent. 2005; 33: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Therefore, FDC-SP may have the similar activities. In this study, we have tried to confirm the ability of FDC-SP to bind to mineralized surfaces. To this end, we first attempted to express the cDNA encoding FDC-SP in an osteogenic progenitor cell line, Kusa-A1, that shows extensive mineralization in vitro (10Umezawa A. Maruyama T. Segawa K. Shadduck R.K. Waheed A. Hata J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Kawashima N. Shindo K. Sakamoto K. Kondo H. Umezawa A. Kasugai M. Perbal B. Suda H. Takagi M. Katsube K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2005; 23: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Stable Gene Expression System—To obtain the stable and high level gene expression in Kusa-A1 cells, we first developed a new gene expression system combining promoter trapping and site-specific gene integration methods. The system, we named Trap-In, is outlined in Fig. 2. It is composed of two parts. One part is the establishment of Kusa-A1 sub-cell line expressing a reporter gene at high levels under the control of an endogenous promoter. For this purpose, we infected Kusa-A1 cells with a retrovirus-based promoter-trapping vector, rvPtrap. The other part is the site-specific integration of cDNA into the position of the reporter gene using FLP recombinase. We first constructed a plasmid vector, prvPtrap, that contains a promoter-less fusion gene of the β-galactosidase and hygromycin phosphotransferase (βgyg) as a reporter gene. This vector was then electroporated into PT67 retrovirus packaging cells with the neomycin phosphotransferase expression vector pSTneoB. After selection with G418, virus-producing cells were cloned, and the produced retrovirus rvPtrap was harvested from the culture medium. Establishment of a Kusa-A1 Sub-cell Line Expressing a High Level of βgyg—To achieve the stable and high level expression of FDC-SP in Kusa-A1 cells, we first established a sub-cell line expressing βgyg at a high level. For this, Kusa-A1 cells were infected with the rvPtrap virus. After selection with hygromycin, X-gal staining revealed the presence of various colonies that exhibited different intensities of β-galactosidase staining. We isolated a colony, Kusa-A1(H2), expressing the highest level of β-galactosidase, and we used it for further experiments (Fig. 3a). Rapid amplification of cDNA 5′ ends (5′ RACE) revealed a partial sequence of the trapped gene that was found to be identical to the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 α1 (Eef1a1) gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_010106) by BLAST search. To verify that the splice acceptor functioned properly in the isolated clone, the sequence obtained on 5′ RACE analysis was carefully compared with the exon-intron junction of the endogenous gene. The result showed that insertion of the vector DNA occurred in the 1st intron of Eef1a1 gene (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, these data indicated that promoter trapping by the rvPtrap vector had successfully occurred as we expected. Furthermore, we verified whether Kusa-A1(H2) cells had mineralization activity and whether the reporter gene was constitutively active independent of mineralization. When the cells were cultured in normal medium (noninducing conditions), they exhibited no mineralization. However, treatment with ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate (inducing conditions) induced mineral deposition detected by von Kossa's staining (Fig. 3b) and Alizarin Red staining (data not shown). In contrast, X-gal staining indicated that the reporter gene was always active independent of culture conditions (Fig. 3b). Expression of FDC-SP in Kusa-A1(H2)—Prior to the forced expression of FDC-SP, we first expressed GFP as a control. For this purpose, we cloned a cDNA encoding GFP into the plasmid vector pInSRT. The resultant plasmid, pInSRT-GFP, was then co-transfected into Kusa-A1(H2) with a plasmid vector pOG44 by electroporation. As shown in Fig. 4, bright fluorescence from intracellularly expressed GFP protein was observed for all the cells obtained by puromycin selection. In addition, it is clear that GFP expression is independent of culture conditions such as cell density and mineral deposition. Next, we expressed FDC-SP in Kusa-A1(H2) cells. For ease in the observation of FDC-SP expression, we made the fusion construct of GFP and human FDC-SP as a secretory protein, and we cloned it into the pInSRT vector. The expression of the fusion protein, GFP-hFDC.SP, in Kusa-A1(H2) was performed as described above. After selection with puromycin, many colonies appeared, but no cell was positive for GFP fluorescence in noninducing conditions. However, hydroxyapatite particles added to the culture as positional markers took on GFP fluorescence (Fig. 5a). The accumulation of fluorescent material was more clearly observed when the cells were cultured under inducing conditions (Fig. 5d). These observations clearly indicated that GFP-hFDC.SP is secreted extracellularly and has binding activity to mineral deposits. To confirm that GFP-hFDC.SP adsorption onto mineral deposits was dependent on and specific to the structure of FDC-SP, we expressed a single amino acid substitution construct and C-terminal deletion constructs as shown in Fig. 6a. Interestingly, all the mutated constructs caused the disappearance of the accumulation fluorescent material (Fig. 6b) even though the expression and secretion of the fusion proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 6, c and d). Incidentally, the intact human FDC-SP molecule was not detected in this experiment because its molecular size was too small (7,965 Da) to be retained by a Centricon YM-30 membrane during the required concentration of the culture medium. The differences in molecular size among GFP-hFDC.SP and its deletion constructs were too small to be detected in the immunoblot analysis. FDC-SP is a small secretory protein that is expressed in oral and in glandular tissues (3Nakamura S. Terashima T. Yoshida T. Iseki S. Takano Y. Ishikawa I. Shinomura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although Marshall et al. (1Marshall A.J. Du Q. Draves K.E. Shikishima Y. HayGlass K.T. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2381-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) reported that FDC-SP showed significant binding to B cells, its physiological function in oral tissues is not known. In this study, we investigated the binding capacity of FDC-SP to mineral based on its structural similarity to statherin, which is tightly adsorbed to hydroxyapatite (5Raj P.A. Johnsson M. Levine M.J. Nancollas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5968-5976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To this end, we first developed a new cDNA expression system named Trap-In. This system introduced a promoter-free construct that contained a specific recombination site for the introduction of any additional cDNA into a host cell. Therefore, all resulting cDNA expression for, in this case, FDC-SP was totally dependent on the activity of the endogenous promoter within the host cell. The introduced cDNA will also experience the same positional chromosomal effects on expression as the host gene. As a result, we can compare the expression of various cDNA constructs without regard for positional effects as long as we use the same cell line. Our expression system is quite new and will have a broad range of applications, although retroviral infection of target cells is a minimum requirement. We have already verified that this system worked at least in mouse C3H10T1/2 cells, mouse ATDC5 cells (16Shinomura T. Ito K. Kimura J.H. Höök M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and rat chondrosarcoma cells (17King K.B. Kimura J.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 992-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To obtain the final Trap-In system, we first established a cell line expressing a βgeo reporter gene in the cell being studied. Then we were able to easily replace the reporter gene with any cDNA up to at least 9 kb with the cell line (data not shown). In this study, we used a murine osteogenic progenitor cell line, Kusa-A1, for the expression of human FDC-SP. This cell line, established from femoral bone marrow stromal cells (10Umezawa A. Maruyama T. Segawa K. Shadduck R.K. Waheed A. Hata J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), shows mineralization in vitro (15Kawashima N. Shindo K. Sakamoto K. Kondo H. Umezawa A. Kasugai M. Perbal B. Suda H. Takagi M. Katsube K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2005; 23: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, Alizarin Red staining observed in the culture was not completely stable in PBS. Repetitive washing with PBS easily removed the dye from the culture even though the culture was fixed with formalin or ethanol. These observations suggested that deposits of FDC-SP on mineral observed in the culture might be not stable. This is the reason why we used a GFP fusion protein in this study. It was easy to observe the distribution of the GFP-FDC.SP fusion protein in living cultures without any staining procedures. Of course, we have tried to express the intact human FDC-SP molecule, but we could not detect it by immunofluorescent staining using a specific antibody (data not shown). This observation might suggest that FDC-SP bound calcium as Alizarin Red S could chelate it. As shown in Fig. 5, GFP-hFDC.SP can bind to mineral deposits and hydroxyapatite surfaces. These data strongly suggested that FDC-SP synthesized by periodontal ligament cells would bind to the surface of alveolar bone and cementum in vivo. In addition, FDC-SP that is expected to be present in gingival crevicular fluid from junctional epithelium would coat the enamel surfaces of teeth. These adsorptions onto mineral and hydroxyapatite surfaces seem to be dependent on the structural integrity of FDC-SP. The experiments using an amino acid substitution construct and C-terminal deletion constructs (Fig. 6) clearly indicated that the intact structure of FDC-SP was important for the adsorption described above. A similar structural requirement for adsorption onto hydroxyapatite and mineralized surfaces has been reported for statherin (4Schenkels L.C. Veerman E.C. Nieuw Amerongen A.V. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 14Goobes G. Goobes R. Schueler-Furman O. Baker D. Stayton P. Drobny G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(18Rowe P.S.N. Kumagai Y. Gutierrez G. Garrett I.R. Blacher R. Rosen D. Cundy J. Navvab S. Chen D. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Mundy G.R.

Although the motif is not present in the mature FDC-SP, it shows some structural similarity to statherin as described above. Therefore, these two molecules might have some functional redundancy in vivo at least in humans who make both. This is not true in the mouse, however, because although the mouse has the FDC-SP gene (3Nakamura S. Terashima T. Yoshida T. Iseki S. Takano Y. Ishikawa I. Shinomura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the statherin gene is present only as a pseudogene (19Kawasaki K. Weiss K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4060-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A gene knock-out of FDC-SP in mouse would be very informative in understanding the biological function of FDC-SP. Expression of FDC-SP was observed at a high level in the junctional epithelium in addition to other structures such as tonsils, prostate gland, lymph nodes, and trachea, which all play a role in host defense (1Marshall A.J.

Ishikawa I. Shinomura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1197-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, the proline-rich region in the C-terminal domain of FDC-SP has some structural similarity to an antimicrobial peptide Bac5 (20Brogden K.A. Ackermann M. McCray Jr., P.B. Tack B.F. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2003; 22: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to suggest that FDC-SP may play an important role as part of a local defense mechanism against infection in the oral cavity. In any case, further study will be necessary to understand the relationship between the specific expression of FDC-SP in junctional epithelium at the gingival crevice and periodontal disease, and the physiological significance of FDC-SP expression in the periodontal ligament and in other nonmineralized tissues.

K4CP catalyzes alternative transfers of glucoronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to elongate a chain consisting of the repeated disaccharide sequence GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4. Unlike the polymerization reactions of DNA and RNA and polypeptide synthesis, which depend upon templates, the monosaccharide polymerization by K4CP does not. To investigate the catalytic mechanism of this reaction, we have used isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the binding of the donor substrates UDP-GlcA and UDP-GalNAc to purified K4CP protein and its mutants. Only one donor molecule bound to one molecule of K4CP at a time. UDP-GlcA bound only to the C-terminal active site at a high affinity (Kd = 6.81 μm), thus initiating the polymerization reaction. UDP-GalNAc could bind to either the N-terminal or C-terminal active sites at a low affinity (Kd = 266–283 μm) but not to both sites at the same time. The binding affinity of UDP-GalNAc to a K4CP N-terminal fragment (residues 58–357) was profoundly decreased, yielding the average Kd value of 23.77 μm, closer to the previously reported Km value for the UDP-GalNAc transfer reaction that takes place at the N-terminal active site. Thus, the first step of the reaction appears to be the binding of UDP-GlcA to the C-terminal active site, whereas the second step involves the C-terminal region of the K4CP molecule regulating the binding of UDP-GalNAc to only the N-terminal active site.

Chondroitin sulfate is a glucosaminoglycan that is a polysaccharide chain composed of the sugar molecules glucuronic acid (GlcA) 2The abbreviations used are: GlcA, glucuronic acid; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). A disaccharide unit (GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4) continually repeats to form a nonbranching polysaccharide chain that can consist of over a hundred individual monosaccharides, each of which can be sulfated in various positions and quantities (1Wight T.N. Heinegard D.K. Hascall V.C. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Press, New York1991: 45-78Crossref Google Scholar). Chondroitin chains are usually found attached to proteins, forming proteoglycans, and are present in the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces of various human tissues including the cartilage, aorta, skeletal muscle, eye, lung, and brain tissues (2Zako M. Shinomura T. Miyashi O. Iwaki M. Kimata K. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2155-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Oohira A. Katoh-Semba R. Watanabe E. Matsui F. Neurosci.

Through interaction with various extracellular proteins, chondroitin plays a critical role in the regulation of a variety of cellular activities including growth, development, and response to injury in the nervous system (5Fitch M.T.

For example, the loss of chondroitin sulfate from the cartilage is a major cause of osteoarthritis and intervertebral disc and cartilage degeneration (7Sakai K. Kimata K. Sato T. Gotoh M.

However, the molecular mechanism of the polymerization reaction catalyzed by these enzymes remains virtually unknown. Bacterial cells also synthesize a chondroitin chain. Although mammalian chondroitin polymerases are Golgi membrane-bound enzymes, those of bacterial polymerases are soluble enzymes. For instance, the K4 strain of Escherichia coli contains an enzyme, encoded by the KfoC gene of the K4 gene cluster, that catalyzes the synthesis of the chondroitin chain, named K4 chondroitin polymerase or K4CP (9Ninomiya T. Sugiura N. Tawada A. Sugimoto K. Watanabe H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21567-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The reduced amino acid sequence of K4CP revealed two conserved UDP-sugar binding motifs (DXD), one located in the N-terminal region and the other located in the C-terminal region of the molecule. Comparative sequence analysis shows that the system of two active sites is conserved in the other bacterial and mammalian chondroitin polymerases as well as the other polysaccharide polymerases such as the heparan polymerase Exostosins (10Jing W.

We have previously employed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to investigate the specific binding of donor substrate to UDP-N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase Exostosin Like-2 that possesses only one active site (17Sobhany M. Dong J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23441-23445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using the water solubility of the bacterial K4CP enzyme to our advantage, we have now extended our study to include the ITC measurement of binding specificity of donor substrates to the two active sites of K4CP to explicate the catalytic mechanism of how this enzyme executes the polymerization process. We bacterially expressed a truncated enzyme of K4CP (from residues 55 to 686) that retained all of the original polymerase activity, from which the DXD motifs were mutated to generate various mutant enzymes. In addition, a deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal half of the K4CP was constructed. Wild type K4CP and these mutants were expressed in bacterial cells, purified, and subjected to ITC analysis to determine the nature of binding for the donor substrates UDP-GlcA, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc. UDP binding was also investigated. Here we now present key elements of the specific donor bindings that are consistent with the catalytic mechanism of the alternative transfer reactions by K4CP. Expression and Purification of Proteins—E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pGEX K4CP were grown and harvested as previously reported (17Sobhany M. Dong J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23441-23445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The cells were then disrupted in a French Press at room temperature under pressures varying between 8,000 and 24,000 p.s.i. Following ultracentrifugation, the K4CP protein was then purified from the supernatants by absorption onto glutathione-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) and eluted via thrombin cleavage overnight at 4 °C. The eluted protein was then dialyzed overnight into 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2. Purification of protein was confirmed by taking 10 μl of eluted protein and combining it with 4 μl of NuPage 4× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), 2 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and then running the sample on a NuPage 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). The gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Fluka) and then destained to make the protein bands more clearly visible. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were carried out in HEPES buffer using a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (Micro Cal, Inc.) at 20 °C. Substrate solution was injected into a reaction cell containing the protein. For substrate solutions containing UDP-GlcA, thirty injections of 3 μl at 180-s intervals were performed. For substrate solutions containing UDP, UDP-GlcNAc, or UDP-GalNAc, 30 injections of 3 μl at 300-s intervals were performed. Data acquisition and analysis were performed by the MicroCal Origin software package. Data analysis was performed by generating a binding isotherm and best fit using the following fitting parameters: n (number of sites), ΔH (cal/mol), ΔS (cal/mol/deg), and K (binding constant in m–1), and the standard Levenberg-Marquardt methods (18Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in FORTRAN: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1989Google Scholar). Following data analysis, K (m–1) is then converted to Kd (μm). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the protocols described in the accompanying instruction manual. The pairs of primers used to mutate the DCD-binding motif found in the N terminus region to ACA, DCE, and DCK were: TGGGTTCGGAGCCATAGCACAAGCCAGAATTGCAACATA and TATGTTGCAATTCTGGCTTGTGCTATGGCTCCGAACCCA; TGGGTTCGGAGCCATTTCACAATCCAGAATTGC and GCAATTCTGGATTGTGAAATGGCTCCGAACCCA; and TGGGTTCGGAGCCATTTTACAATCCAGAATTGC and GCAATTCTGGATTGTAAAATGGCTCCGAACCCA, respectively. The pairs of primers used to mutate the DSD-binding motif found in the C terminus region to ASA, DSE, DSK, DSA, ASD, and KSD were: TGGTTCAAGAAAGTCAGCAGAGGCTAACTGACCTATATA and TATATAGGTCAGTTAGCCTCTGCTGACTTTCTTGAACCA; TTCAAGAAAGTCTTCAGAGTCTAACTGACCTAT and ATAGGTCAGTTAGACTCTGAAGACTTTCTTGAA; TTCAAGAAAGTCTTTAGAGTCTAACTGACCTAT and ATAGGTCAGTTAGACTCTAAAGACTTTCTTGAA; TTCAAGAAAGTCAGCAGAGTCTAACTGACCTAT and ATAGGTCAGTTAGACTCTGCTGACTTTCTTGAA; TTCAAGAAAGTCATCAGAGGCTAACTGACCTAT and ATAGGTCAGTTAGCCTCTGATGACTTTCTTGAA; and TTCAAGAAAGTCATCAGATTTTAACTGACCTAT and ATAGGTCAGTTAAAATCTGATGACTTTCTTGAA, respectively. The primers used to generate the ACA and ASA mutants were also used to generate the double mutant, thereby mutating the DXD motifs found in both regions to AXA. The primers used to generate the ACA and DSA mutants were used to create the double mutant in which the N terminus-binding site was mutated to ACA and the C terminus-binding site was converted to DSA. The primers used to delete the C-terminal region of the enzyme were: CGCGGATCCAAAGCTGTTATTGATATTGAT and CGGAATTCTTAATGCGTAAACTCTTCATCAAA. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing with the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Enzyme Assays—Hydrolysis was determined as follows. 53 μg of protein were tested in an assay mixture containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 μl of either UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (36.0 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), UDP-[3H]GlcA (20.0 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.), or UDP-[3H]GalNAc (20.0 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.). Assay mixtures containing radioactive plus nonradioactive substrates at final concentrations of 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, 9.6, 16.0, 32.0, 64.0, 96.0, 128.0, and 200.0 μm were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The incubation mixtures were boiled for 2 min, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 20,400 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were subjected to a Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 30pg column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 250 mm NH4HCO3 containing 7% 1-propanol using the ÄKTA Purifier (GE Healthcare). Fractions were collected at a rate of 1 ml/min, and the amount of the hydrolyzed product UDP was quantified with a scintillation counter. Data analysis was performed using the Origin version 7.0 software programmed to fit data to an s/v-s plot to calculate the Km and Vmax values using Michealis-Menten kinetics. Binding of UDP-GlcA—ITC was performed to examine the binding of UDP-GlcA to the truncated K4CP (hereafter referred to as K4CP). The calorimetric profile showed that UDP-GlcA bound to K4CP at a ratio of one donor molecule to one enzyme molecule (Fig. 1). The binding of UDP-GlcA was tested at various temperatures ranging from 5 to 40 °C to ascertain the nature of donor binding (Table 1), from which the true values for the changes in entropy (ΔS) and enthalpy (ΔH) were directly determined by plotting Log K versus 1000/K°: ΔS = −25.18 ± 1.43 cal/mol/deg and ΔH =–14,000.45 ± 419.29 cal/mol (19Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 145-278Google Scholar). Using these values, it was found that the TΔS was lower in value than the ΔH value, suggesting that this binding is an enthalpy-driven reaction. In addition, the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) values remained constant over the various temperatures, implying that the nature of this binding reaction is spontaneous and that the maximum potential of K4CP to perform the binding remains the same over a range of temperatures. As expected, the Kd values varied from 3.26 to 55.09 μm depending upon the temperatures used for the assays, whereas the number of the UDP-GlcA molecules that bound to the K4CP molecule was the same at all temperatures (Table 1).TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters, ΔG, ΔH, ΔS, number of binding sites (n), and the binding constant, Kd for UDP-GlcA binding with wild type K4CP at five different temperaturesTemperatureΔGΔHΔSKdncal/molcal/molcal/mol/degμm5 °C-6983.4 ± 1064-10,350 ± 1064-12.113.26 ± 1.781.05 ± 0.0810 °C-6815.3 ± 2557-12,280 ± 2557-19.315.55 ± 2.130.85 ± 0.1420 °C-6652.3 ± 1973-11,100 ± 1973-15.1811.04 ± 3.330.82 ± 0.1130 °C-6331.4 ± 703.8-14,370 ± 703.8-26.5327.32 ± 10.940.93 ± 0.2540 °C-6107.4 ± 4077-18,690 ± 4077-40.2055.09 ± 8.240.97 ± 0.19 Open table in a new tab Binding of UDP-GalNAc and UDP—ITC was performed at 20 °C for determining the binding of UDP-GalNAc and UDP. Both UDP-GalNAc and UDP bound to K4CP at a one to one molecular ratio (Table 2). UDP-GalNAc was characterized by its extremely high Kd value, 358.17 μm at 20 °C. This value was more than 40-fold higher when compared with the Kd value of 8.5 μm at 20 °C yielded by UDP-GlcA binding and the averaged Kd value (6. 81 ± 1.72 μm) for UDP-GlcA, a number arrived at by calculating from five different binding assays. The Km values of UDP-GlcA and UDP-GalNAc transfer reactions were previously reported (9Ninomiya T. Sugiura N. Tawada A. Sugimoto K. Watanabe H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21567-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the Kd value of 358.17 μm was over 10-fold higher than the reported Km value (31.6 μm) of the UDP-GalNAc transfer reaction catalyzed by K4CP, whereas the corresponding Kd and Km values for UDP-GlcA were similar. The inactive donor substrate UDP bound to K4CP at a Kd value of 89.53 μm, which was higher than the Kd value of UDP-GlcA binding but was lower than that of UDP-GalNAc binding. Only one UDP molecule was found to bind to the K4CP molecule, which was unexpected given the fact that there are two binding sites for donor substrates. These experimental observations are at first glance puzzling but may provide the insightful clues necessary to understand the catalytic mechanism of the polymerization reaction; both UDP and UDP-GalNAc bind to K4CP at a one to one molecular ratio, and the Kd value of UDP-GalNAc was higher than the reported Km value.TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters, ΔG, ΔH, ΔS, number of binding sites (n), and the binding constant, Kd for donor binding with wild type K4CP in solution at 20 °CSubstrateΔGΔHΔSKdncal/molcal/molcal/mol/degμmUDP-GlcA-7209.1 ± 1124-11,270 ± 1124-13.868.05 ± 1.520.95 ± 0.07UDP-GalNAc-4779.2 ± 483.9-11,630 ± 483.9-22.61358.17 ± 26.641.25 ± 0.32UDP-5431.7 ± 1953-8643 ± 1953-10.9689.53 ± 22.770.91 ± 0.09 Open table in a new tab Delineating the Specific Donor-binding Site—Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to mutate the aspartic acid residues of the K4CP DXD motifs: either the N-terminal 239DCD241 or the C-terminal 519DSD521 to 239ACA241 or 519ASA521. In addition, both 239DCD241 and 519DSD521 were simultaneously mutated to 239ACA241 and 519ASA521, hereafter just referred to as DXDdm. These mutants were subjected to ITC analysis (Table 3). UDP-GlcA bound to the 239DCD241 mutant but not to the 519DSD521 mutant, and moreover, the Kd value of this binding was close to that of the UDP-GlcA binding to K4CP. These results unequivocally identified the C-terminal DSD as the sole binding site of UDP-GlcA. UDP-GalNAc was found to bind to the both 239ACA241 and 519ASA521 mutants at similar affinities; their Kd values were within the range of the Kd value (358.18 μm) of UDP-GalNAc binding to K4CP. Thus, UDP-GalNAc is capable of binding to either the N- or C-terminal DXD motif. This tantalizing observation lead us to measure UDP-GalNAc transfer activity by the DXD mutants: K4CP and the 519DSD521 mutant catalyzed the reaction at 5.895 and 5.469 pmol/min/μg protein, respectively, but the 239ACA241 exhibited no transfer activity (Table 4). Because UDP-GalNAc was found to bind to K4CP at a one to one molecular ratio, the N-terminal 239DCD241 should be the binding site of UDP-GalNAc during the transfer reaction. However, the present binding assays using ITC could not determine the binding site of UDP-GalNAc. In a fashion similar to UDP-GalNAc, UDP bound to both the 239ACA241 and 519ASA521 mutants. Because the Kd value for the former mutant was closer to that for K4CP (89.53 μm) than that for the latter mutant, this one molecule of UDP appeared to bind to the C-terminal 519DSD521 of K4CP. As expected, when both 75DCD77 and 519DSD521 were mutated, the DXDdm possessed no capability to bind any of the donor substrates.TABLE 3Comparison of the binding constants Kd of UDP, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GlcA for wild type K4CP to the mutant constructs 239ACA241, 519ASA521, and DXDdmEnzymeUDP-GlcAUDP-GalNAcUDPWildKd8.05 ± 1.52358.17 ± 26.6489.53 ± 22.77n0.95 ± 0.071.25 ± 0.320.91 ± 0.09239ACA241Kd14.12 ± 1.50266.74 ± 57.5854.23 ± 11.18n0.99 ± 0.080.94 ± 0.110.72 ± 0.34519ASA521KdND283.69 ± 30.7616.70 ± 2.04nND1.15 ± 0.090.99 ± 0.08DXDdmKdNDNDNDnNDNDND Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Hydrolysis and transfer of donor substrates by wild type K4CP, and the mutant constructs 239ACA241 and 519ASA521SubstrateWild239ACA241519ASA521HydrolysisUDP-GlcANDNDNDUDP-GalNAc65.09135.3124.27Transfer activityUDP-GalNAc5.895ND5.469UDP-GlcNAc0.394ND0.534 Open table in a new tab To further elucidate the binding of UDP-GalNAc, we attempted to construct deletion mutants by separating the K4CP molecule into N- and C-terminal fragments (residues 58–357 and residues 358–686, respectively). Although the C-terminal fragment did not express in our bacterial system, we were able to express and purify the N-terminal fragment for ITC analysis (Table 5). Consistent with our previous data, the N-terminal fragment abrogated the binding of UDP-GlcA. Conversely, both UDP-GalNAc and UDP retained their binding to the fragment. Most interestingly, the Kd value of UDP-GalNAc binding became similar to the reported Km value of UDP-GalNAc transfer activity by K4CP. To reutilize the correlation of this Kd value with the catalytic activity of K4CP, we measured hydrolysis of K4CP and the DXD mutants using UDP-GlcA and UDP-GalNAc as substrates (Table 4). No hydrolysis activity was observed with UDP-GlcA with any of these enzymes. On the other hand, UDP-GalNAc was hydrolyzed by all enzymes. The Km value of the hydrolysis by the 519ASA521 mutant was nearly identical to the Kd value of UDP-GalNAc binding to the N-terminal fragment, and moreover, the corresponding value for hydrolysis by K4CP was closer to this Kd value. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the N-terminal 239DCD241 is the binding site of UDP-GalNAc. Furthermore, the relatively high affinity of UDP-GalNAc binding provides critical information for us to hypothesize about the molecular mechanism by which K4CP regulates the binding of UDP-GalNAc to N-terminal 239DCD241.TABLE 5Thermodynamic parameters, ΔG, ΔH, ΔS, number of binding sites (n), and the binding constant Kd for donor binding with the K4CP mutant construct KctDelSubstrateΔGΔHΔSKdncal/molcal/molcal/mol/degμmUDP-GlcANDNDNDNDNDUDP-GalNAc-6184.3 ± 5325-7463 ± 5325-4.2234.72 ± 9.140.82 ± 0.20UDP-6361.4 ± 1721-9249 ± 1721-9.5326.00 ± 6.360.96 ± 0.16 Open table in a new tab Defining the Functions of the C-terminal DSD Motif—Recent x-ray crystal structures of the glycosyltransferases GlcAT1 and EXTL2 have demonstrably shown that the first aspartic acid residue in the DXD motif interacts with the sugar moiety of the donor substrate and that the second aspartic acid residue interacts with the UDP portion of the donor substrate (20Pedersen L.C.

Using this information as a guide, the first aspartic acid of the DXD motif was substituted with a negatively charged glutamic acid and a positively charged lysine to produce the following mutants: 239DCE241, 239DCK241, 519DSE521, and 519DSK521. These mutants were subjected to ITC analysis to decipher the role of aspartic acid in the regulation of donor substrate binding (Table 6). UDP-GlcA was able to bind to all four mutants at a one to one molecular ratio. Thus, the GlcA moiety solely determined the binding of UDP-GlcA. Moreover, the results indicated that the mutations of the N-terminal 239DCD241 had no effect on the binding of UDP-GlcA to the C-terminal 519DSD521. UDP-GalNAc bound to the 239DCE241, 239DCK241, and 519DSE521 mutants (Table 6), which is consistent with the facts that the second aspartic acid does not directly interact with the sugar moiety and that UDP-GalNAc can bind to either the N-terminal or C-terminal DXD motif. A surprising finding was that the 519DSK521 mutant abrogated the bindings of UDP-GalNAc as well as that of UDP. Because the second aspartic acid is the primary residue responsible for the ability of the enzyme to interact with the UDP moiety, it may be reasonable to conclude that UDP does not bind to the C-terminal 519DSK521 site. UDP-GalNAc bound to the C-terminal 519DSD521 site weakly, and its sugar moiety may not be able to overcome the change to the second aspartic acid residue, thereby resulting in its inability to bind to the 519DSK521 site. The most surprising finding, however, was that no binding was detected for UDP-GalNAc and UDP despite the fact that the N-terminal 239DCD241 site remained unaltered, because both UDP-GalNAc and UDP bind to the N-terminal 239DCD241 site of the 519ASA521 mutant (Table 3).TABLE 6Binding constants Kd (μm) of UDP, UDP-GalNAc, and UDP-GlcAEnzymeUDP-GlcAUDP-GalNAcUDP239DCE241Kd5.68 ± 0.81194.48 ± 54.74106.49 ± 24.21n0.84 ± 0.030.81 ± 0.210.81 ± 0.19239DCK241Kd3.57 ± 0.37157.36 ± 39.9145.64 ± 3.98n1.00 ± 0.020.96 ± 0.260.96 ± 0.05519DSE521Kd4.42 ± 0.45155.62 ± 26.6775.13 ± 11.58n0.89 ± 0.010.81 ± 0.160.77 ± 0.24519DSK521Kd12.09 ± 1.62NDNDn0.99 ± 0.03NDND519DSA521KdND222.12 ± 70.269.56 ± 1.07nND0.75 ± 0.140.76 ± 0.02519KSD521KdNDND35.77 ± 4.61nNDND0.95 ± 0.22519ASD521KdNDND23.61 ± 2.31nNDND1.22 ± 0.09239ACA241/519DSA521KdNDNDNDnNDNDND Open table in a new tab The second alanine residue (Ala241) was responsible for binding the two donors to the N-terminal 239DCD241, because the 519DSA521 mutant retained the binding ability of UDP-GalNAc and UDP while losing its binding ability to UDP-GlcA (Table 6). These results suggested that, depending on the type of residue replacing the second aspartic acid, the C-terminal DSD motif differentially regulates the binding of UDP-GalNAc and UDP to the N-terminal DCD motif. Given this conclusion, the first aspartic acid residue of the C-terminal DSD motif was then mutated to lysine and alanine to produce the 519KSD521 and 519ASD521 mutants. This aspartic acid residue is the primary determinant for the binding of the sugar moiety of a donor substrate (20Pedersen L.C. Dong J. Taniguchi F. Kitagawa H. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.G. Sugahara K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14420-14428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochm. Biophys. Res. Commu. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The subsequent loss of UDP-GlcA binding was consistent with the fact that the C-terminal DSD motif is the only site for which UDP-GlcA had an affinity (Table 6). It would be reasonable to observe no binding of UDP-GalNAc to these mutants, if indeed the C-terminal DSD was the only binding site in the K4CP molecule. However, the fact that UDP-GalNAc did not bind to the N-terminal DCD motif of the 519KSD521 and 519ASD521 mutants reiterated the possibility that the C-terminal DSD motif may regulate donor binding to the N-terminal DCD motif, thus becoming a primary regulator of enzyme function and activity of K4CP. It was reasonable that a continuous binding of UDP to these mutants is observed because UDP does not interact with the first aspartic acid residue, and the double mutant 239ACA241/519DSA521 did not bind any of the donor substrates. The chondroitin polymerase K4CP is a multifunctional enzyme that transfers GlcA and GalNAc from the donor substrates UDP-GlcA and UDP-GalNAc to synthesize the (GlcAβ1–3GalNAcβ1–4)n chain. The K4CP molecule contains the two potential binding sites for donor substrates. We have used bacterially expressed and purified K4CP enzymes and have employed ITC to investigate the specific donor bindings. One insightful result is the fact that K4CP is capable of binding to only one donor molecule at a given time regardless of the type of donor substrates: UDP, UDP-GalNAc, or UDP-GlcNAc. Another significant result is the observation suggesting that the C-terminal 519DSD521 site provides K4CP with not only the sole binding site for UDP-GlcA but also the ability to regulate binding of UDP-GalNAc to the N-terminal donor-binding site 239DCD241. Thus, the chondroitin polymerase K4CP appears to utilize a fairly sophisticated mechanism to catalyze the polymerization reaction. A critical question, the answer of which is required for understanding the catalytic mechanism of the polymerization, is whether K4CP has one active site at which both the UDP-GlcA and UDP-GalNAc transfer reactions take place or has two distinct active sites. K4CP catalyzes an inverting reaction, in which the α-configuration of the C1 bond of the donor sugar is inverted to the β-configuration in a product formed (9Ninomiya T. Sugiura N. Tawada A. Sugimoto K. Watanabe H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21567-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structures of various inverting glycosyltransferases have determined the conserved structural signatures and the unique conformation and orientation of substrates at the active site (21Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochm. Biophys. Res. Commu. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The structures of mammalian glycosyltransferases are represented by the so-called GT-A fold that is a single globular protein consisting of two subdomains (21Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochm. Biophys. Res. Commu. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Bounrne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The N-terminal subdomain has a Rossman fold and provides the binding site for the donor substrate, whereas the C-terminal subdomain consists of mixed β-sheets and constitutes the acceptor substrate binding site. At the active site that resides in the open cleft across the two subdomains, the leaving oxygen of the phosphate group and the C1 atom of the donor sugar and the acceptor OH group align to advance a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution type in line displacement reaction. Also the inverting glycosyltransferases are characterized by the presence of a catalytic base residue that deprotonates the acceptor OH group. The x-ray structure of K4CP has now been solved and has revealed two distinct domains. Both domains are characterized by having all of the structural features of the GT-A fold, and both can be perfectly superimposed with known structures of other glycosyltransferases. In addition, the revealed K4CP structure has the two GT-A folds that orient the two active site clefts at an 180° angle, suggesting that the two domains function independently, with nonsequential and random binding and release of donor substrates, as the catalytic mechanism of the polymerase reaction. Our ITC study has concluded that UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcA specifically bind to the N- and C-terminal DXD motifs of the K4CP enzyme, respectively. The presence of two independent binding sites also been implicated in another glycosyltransferase, the Pasteurella multocida hyaluronan synthase (25Williams K.J. Halkes K.M. Kamerling J.P.

Chem. 2006; 281: 5391-5397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Osawa, T., Sugiura, N., Shimada, H., Hirooka, R., Tsuji, A., Shirakawa, T., Fukuyama, K., Kimura, M., Kimata, K., and Kakuta, Y. (2009) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., in pressGoogle Scholar). Consistent with this conclusion, the K4CP structure has led to the conclusion that UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcA are present at the N- and C-terminal GT-A domains, respectively.3 In our ITC study, however, only one molecule of UDP is found to bind to one molecule of a given K4CP enzyme. Although the binding of UDP to the 239ACA241 and 519ACA521 mutants indicates that UDP could bind to either the N- or the C-terminal DXD site, in fact UDP appears to bind to the C-terminal DSD of the wild type K4CP enzyme. During the GlcA transfer reaction, this binding of UDP can be transient because its Kd value is more than 10 times higher that the corresponding value of UDP-GlcA binding. Various experimental features associated with the use of protein crystals to solve structures, such as cocrystallization of K4CP with a high concentration of UDP, which may have led to UDP binding to both DXD sites. Intriguingly, structural analysis of multiple forms of the x-ray crystal structures found that either there is binding of two UDP molecules or no UDP binding at all. This finding may suggest that there is structural cross-talk between the N- and C-terminal DXD sites to regulate UDP binding. Our binding assays demonstrated that UDP-GalNAc could bind to either the N-terminal or C-terminal DXD sites at similar affinities. Thus, during the polymerization reaction, UDP-GalNAc should preferentially bind to the N-terminal DCD site because the UDP-GalNAc transfer reaction is catalyzed by the N-terminal active site. We observed the selective binding of GalNAc to the N-terminal DCD only when the C-terminal DSD was mutated. Contrary to what analysis of the x-ray crystal structural data suggests, the C-terminal domain of K4CP appears to regulate donor binding and probably the transfer activity of the N-terminal domain. K4CP exhibited high affinity binding of UDP-GlcA to the C-terminal DSD motif only and did not hydrolyze UDP-GlcA, so that the enzyme can effectively convert the donor binding activity to its transfer activity. The inability of UDP-GlcA to bind to the N-terminal DCD motif and the constant occupation at the C-terminal DSD motif ensure that this enzyme will never transfer two glucuronic acids sequentially to an acceptor substrate and force UDP-GalNAc binding to the N-terminal DCD motif. In conclusion, ITC analyses have now determined the specific binding of donor substrates to the bacterial chondroitin polymerase K4CP. In solution, only one donor substrate binds to K4CP at a given time. The C-terminal DSD motif binds to UDP-GlcA with a high affinity, apparently initiating the polymerase reaction and coordinating the N-terminal DCD motif to bind to UDP-GalNAc. The underlying molecular mechanism for control of the N-terminal domain by the C-terminal domain with subsequent transfer reactions is a subject ripe for further scrutiny and investigations."

However, mutation of any one of a set of four highly conserved amino acids at the junction of three subunits that form the pores greatly increases the rate of removing iron from ferritin when a reductant such as NADH/FMN is added (12Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Jin W. Takagi H. Pancorbo B. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7525-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Apparently, selective unfolding of the ferritin protein cage around the pores in wild type proteins is induced by mild heat or low concentrations of urea (CD spectroscopy) or in proteins encoded in mutated sequences (x-ray crystallography and CD spectroscopy), whereas integrity of the protein cage is maintained, to increase reduction of the insoluble ferric mineral to soluble Fe2+ (12Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 14Liu X. Jin W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We now report the effect of a pore unfolding mutation on the relative amount of 59Fe in the mutant protein compared with wild type, overexpressed to the same concentration in HeLa cells. Mutating leucine 138 to proline in human H ferritin, necessary because the well characterized frog ferritin H mutation at the homologous site, L134P, could not be expressed in cultured human cells, created a protein with similar solution properties to the frog model as follows: increased (17-fold) iron removal in solutions and decreased α-helix content, showing the conservation of ferritin pore structure/function. The amount of iron (59Fe) in the mutant human ferritin H was significantly (p < 0.01) lower than wild type ferritin when overexpressed to the same level in HeLa cells. Moreover, the 59Fe in cells expressing the mutant ferritin was significantly more accessible (p < 0.01) to chelators (Desferal®) compared with cells expressing wild type ferritin H. The combined results indicate a contribution of pore unfolding to the recovery of iron from ferritin minerals in vivo. Construction of Expression Plasmids and Protein Purification—Copy DNA for the coding region of human ferritin H (HuFtH), 3The abbreviations used are: HuFtH, human ferritin H; DFO, deferoxamine B mesylate (Desferal®); HuFtH-WT, human wild type ferritin H; HuFtH L138P, human ferritin H with pores unfolded by substitution of a conserved amino acid in the pore/channel; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PCR-amplified from Marathon Ready HeLa cell cDNA (Clontech) and cloned in pUC19 plasmid (pUC19-FtH), was subcloned at the NdeI/BamHI site of pET3a (Novagen) for amplification in Escherichia coli, using the following two primers: forward, 5′-GACATATGACGACCGCGTCCACC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTGGATCCTTAGCTTTCATTATCACTGTCTCCCAG-3′, respectively. A mammalian expression vector for HuFtH was constructed using pcDNA™3.1 Directional TOPO expression kit (Invitrogen). Primers for HuFtH cDNA amplification from pUC19-FtH were as follows: forward, 5′-CACCATGGATTCCCAGGTCCGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTAGCTGCTCTCTCTCCCATGGTG-3′, respectively. The amplified cDNA was ligated to the TOPO cloning site of pcDNA™3.1D/V5-His-TOPO vector according to manufacturer's instructions. The codon for leucine 138 (leucine 134 in frog, horse, sheep numbering) was replaced with the codon for proline by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, in both the pcDNA3.1 (mammalian expression) and pET3a (E. coli protein expression) plasmids. Primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-CATTGAGACACATTACCCGAATGAGCAGGTGAAAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCTTTCACCTGCTCATTCGGGTAATGTGTCTCAATG-3′, respectively. All expression plasmids were analyzed (University of California, Berkeley, DNA Sequencing Facility) to confirm DNA sequence. The wild type and the pore mutant (HuFtH L138P) ferritins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene) and were purified by the method described previously (27Waldo G.S. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13262-13269Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), using LB medium. Iron Uptake and Release—Iron uptake, Fe2+ oxidation/mineralization, was monitored as the change in A350 nm. Ferritins were mineralized by mixing a freshly prepared ferrous sulfate solution (in 1 mm HCl) with recombinant apoferritin, to a final concentration of 4.16 μm protein cages, 2 mm iron (480 mineralized iron/protein cage), and 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, as described previously (12Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Iron release was initiated by adding reductant (NADH/FMN) (23Jones T. Spencer R. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4011-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) with bipyridyl as a chelator and reporter, as described previously (12Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 14Liu X. Jin W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Final concentrations were 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7, 0.1 m NaCl, 1.04 μm mineralized ferritin, 0.5 mm Fe3+, 5 mm NADH/FMN, and 2.5 mm bipyridyl. Fe2+ release was monitored as formation of the Fe2+-(bipyridyl)3 complex, outside the protein cages, as the changes in A522 nm. Initial rates (μmol liter–1 s–1) were calculated using the molar extinction coefficient for Fe2+-(bipyridyl)3, 8430 m–1 cm–1 (23Jones T. Spencer R. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4011-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), from the slope of the linear plot (R2 = 0.95–0.99) from 0 to 1 min, as we described before (14Liu X. Jin W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The data are presented as the average of the results from three independent protein preparations for each type of ferritin with >2 replicates for each set of proteins, and the error is the standard deviation. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on a Pi*-180 spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK) at 20 °C. The protein concentrations were 0.05 μm nanocages in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Spectra were measured from 200 to 300 nm with 0.1 nm resolution in a quartz cell with a 1-cm path length; data from 10 replicates were averaged. The α-helical content was estimated from the mean molar ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222) as follows: α-helical content (%) = –([θ]222 + 2340) × 100/30300 (28Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar). 59Fe-Transferrin Labeling—59FeCl3 in 0.5 m HCl (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was mixed with an aqueous solution of disodium nitrilotriacetic acid at a molar ratio of 1:5, as described in Ref. 29Schlabach M.R. Bates G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2182-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, to maintain iron as mononuclear complexes. Lyophilized apotransferrin (human) (Sigma) was dissolved in HEPES buffer (250 mm HEPES, 10 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 8), and 59Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid added, protein/iron = 1:1.9, to ensure all the 59Fe was bound to protein. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h and overnight at 4 °C, the buffer was exchanged for PBS using a PD-10 salt exchange column (GE Healthcare); the solution filter was sterilized and protein concentration measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). All the 59Fe was in transferrin, judged by native PAGE (4–12% Tris-glycine gel) (Invitrogen), autoradiography, and densitometry (ImageQuant, GE Healthcare). Cell Culture, Ferritin Overexpression, Labeling with 59Fe, andEffects of Deferoxamine Mesylate—HeLa cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%) (Atlanta Biologicals), penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml) (Invitrogen), modified Eagle's medium nonessential amino acid (0.1 mm) (Invitrogen), and sodium pyruvate (1 mm) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 106 cells per well in antibiotic-free medium in 6-well plates. After 20 h of incubation, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/V5-HisA (Invitrogen) with or without ferritin sequences, using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) at a DNA (μg) to reagent (μl) ratio of 4:20. Transient transfection of HeLa cells was used to the avoid the possible toxicity of the ferritin pore mutant suggested by the failure to transfect the frog H L134P pore mutant ferritin and by the differential expression we observed of human wild type and L138P protein in HepG2 cells. 59Fe-Transferrin was added, after removing the transfection medium and washing twice with PBS and adding fresh medium, 20 h after transfection. The cells were labeled for 2 h, and the transferrin concentration was 0.1 μm59Fe-transferrin. After removing the labeled medium and washing three times with PBS, 59Fe cells were collected in PBS by scraping, and the cells were sedimented by centrifugation. 59Fe was measured on the cell pellets in a solid state scintillation counter. In some experiments, medium with 10 μm Desferal® (Sigma) was added to washed 59Fe-labeled cells. The incubation was then continued for 20 h, followed by washing and collection of cell pellets and measuring 59Fe in cell pellets and culture medium. Cytoplasmic extracts were obtained from cell pellets resuspended in 40 μl of PBS, lysed by five freeze-thaw cycles, and clarified by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). 59Fe was analyzed by scintillation counting, and protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 59Fe-proteins (20 μg of total protein) were resolved with native PAGE (4–12% Tris-glycine gel) (Invitrogen) and detected with autoradiography. Ferritin concentrations were measured with ELISA (Laguna Scientific) with a human liver ferritin standard. Values for endogenous ferritin concentration and 59Fe-ferritin in cell extracts were determined in parallel experiments. Visual examination of cells after iron or chelator treatment indicated no change in cell health. All experiments were repeated three times with independently plated cell cultures. The data presented are averages, and the error is presented as the standard deviation. Western Blotting/Immunoprecipitation—Ferritin protein expression, wild type and mutant, was analyzed in the HeLa cell extracts described above, with 20 μg of protein. Protein separations used SDS-PAGE (4–12% BisTris gels) and native-PAGE (4–12% Tris-glycine gels), blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (X-Cell Blot Module, Invitrogen). After blocking in TBST buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% skim milk, ferritin was detected using rabbit anti-human ferritin IgG (Novus Biologicals) as the primary antibody (1:5000 dilution) and goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP conjugate (Bio-Rad) as the secondary antibody (1:50,000 dilution). Antibody binding was detected with an Immun-Star™ HRP substrate kit (Bio-Rad). β-Actin was measured on the same blots by stripping ferritin antibodies with three changes of 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.8, over 30 min, and three washes with TBST buffer over 15 min, followed by the addition of HRP-monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Abcam) for 1 h at room temperature and development with Immun-Star™ HRP substrate (Bio-Rad). Human ferritin was applied to the gels over the concentration ranges of ferritin in the cell extracts as standards. To immunoprecipitate ferritin from cell extracts, 0.5 mg of protein was used, extracted from pools of cells obtained from three culture wells, suspended in 0.6 ml of PBS, and lysed as described above. Rabbit anti-human ferritin IgG (Novus Biologicals) was used with a protein G immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma), according to manufacturer's instructions. Ferritin was eluted in 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and both 59Fe and ferritin protein were quantitated (ELISA, Laguna Scientific, and human liver ferritin standard). Data from different experiments were normalized by subtracting endogenous ferritin values (transfection with empty plasmid) in each experiment. Changing a Conserved Leucine to Proline Unfolds the Pores in Recombinant Human Ferritin H—Human ferritin H was selected to study the effects of ferritin pores unfolded by mutation because the more extensively characterized (12Takagi H.

Transfection of these cells with the mammalian expression vectors encoding frog ferritin H (wild type and H L134P, the pore mutant) severely affected cell survival, and the expression of these proteins was not detectable in the viable cells. We then turned to human ferritin H where the N-terminal extension of four residues, compared with horse or frog ferritins (31Harrison P.M. Lilley T.H. Loehr T.M. Iron Carriers and Iron Proteins. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1989: 123-238Google Scholar), shifts residue numbers by +4. Thus, we constructed human ferritin H L138P, which is homologous to L134P, a mutation in one of the conserved, pore gating residues. All four ferritin residues identified as affecting ferritin pore folding/unfolding are conserved not only in human and frog ferritins but all other known ferritins; the overall sequence identity of frog and human ferritin H is 65% (17Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). Assembly of the recombinant human ferritin H L138P ferritin protein cage was normal (gel filtration) as in the homologous frog ferritin mutant (12Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, the protein mineralization rate was essentially identical for wild type and H L138P mutant proteins, as observed previously (13Jin W. Takagi H. Pancorbo B. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7525-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the iron release rate was increased (Fig. 1) similarly to the frog mutant protein (12Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), which confirms the role of the conserved leucine. The rate of iron release from human ferritin L138P was >4-fold larger than the wild type protein (Fig. 1). Moreover, the time required to reduce and release 50% of the mineral to chelators outside the protein cage (12Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was 17-fold faster for human ferritin H L138P than for the wild type protein (Fig. 1, B and C). A physical consequence of pore unfolding in ferritin is a loss of α-helix, detectable by CD spectroscopy (14Liu X. Jin W. Theil E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); the overall α-helix content of ferritin is ∼70%. A decrease of 8% in the helix content of the human H L138P ferritin (Fig. 1D) was observed (CD spectroscopy), close to that predicted if the eight pores were completely unfolded. The results are comparable with those in the frog H L134P. Thus, the solution properties of decreased helix content and rapid iron release, triggered by a natural reductant, are comparable for both the human H L138P and the homologous frog H L134P ferritins, emphasizing the ability of one of the conserved pore residues to alter iron release from ferritins with varied backbone sequences, by changing helix stability around the pores. Pore Mutant Ferritin, Expressed and Assembled in HeLa Cells, Has Less 59Fe than Wild Type—We investigated the function of gated pores in vivo, by comparing 59Fe uptake and distribution in HeLa cells where HuFtH-WT or pore mutant, human ferritin H were overexpressed to comparable levels (Fig. 2); 59Fe was provided as 59Fe-transferrin. HeLa cells were selected as the test cell line because expression from transfected plasmids of mutant and wild type human ferritins was similar (Fig. 2), contrasting with HepG2 cells where expression of the mutant human ferritin was lower than wild type. The mobility of wild type and mutant human ferritins in transfected cells was identical to endogenous human ferritin in both denaturing and native gel electrophoresis indicating both normal subunit size and normal assembly of the overexpressed proteins in the HeLa cells. Overexpression increased ferritin concentrations by ELISA ∼4-fold over endogenous levels (Fig. 2 and Table 1), and by densitometry of Western blots (Fig. 2) ∼8–10-fold compared with the transfection control (plasmid with no insert). The difference may relate to the fact that commercial ELISA kits, developed for the detection of ferritin in serum, are standardized with human liver ferritin rich in ferritin L, although we are expressing ferritin H, which differs in sequence from ferritin L by 35%. Nevertheless, by both analytical methods, ferritin H and ferritin H L138P were overexpressed far above the endogenous ferritin level and, most importantly for these experiments, to comparable levels.TABLE 1Unfolding ferritin pores by mutation decreases ferritin 59Fe in HeLa cellsDistribution of 59Fe in HeLa cells (0.1 μm 59Fe-transferrin, 2 h)aThe data are average from three independent experiments, and the errors are the standard deviation.Transfection controlbTransfection control is plasmid with no insert; HuFtH-WT is plasmid encoding human wild type ferritin H; HuFtH L138P is plasmid encoding human ferritin H with pores unfolded by substitution of a conserved amino acid in the pore/channel.Wild type (HuFtH-WT)bTransfection control is plasmid with no insert; HuFtH-WT is plasmid encoding human wild type ferritin H; HuFtH L138P is plasmid encoding human ferritin H with pores unfolded by substitution of a conserved amino acid in the pore/channel.Open pore mutant (HuFtH L138P)bTransfection control is plasmid with no insert; HuFtH-WT is plasmid encoding human wild type ferritin H; HuFtH L138P is plasmid encoding human ferritin H with pores unfolded by substitution of a conserved amino acid in the pore/channel.Total cell 59Fe (cpm × 10-3)4.77 ± 0.295.06 ± 0.334.62 ± 0.31Ferritin concentration (ng of ferritin/mg of total protein, ELISA)28.0 ± 6.14115 ± 19118 ± 20Cytoplasmic 59Fe (cpm/ng total protein)14.1 ± 1.420.7 ± 1.3cData are significantly different from pore mutant (HuFtH L138P) or transfection control: ***, p < 0.005, and *, p < 0.05.*Data are significantly different from pore mutant (HuFtH L138P) or transfection control: ***, p < 0.005, and *, p < 0.05.16.0 ± 0.6059Fe in the insoluble fraction after cell lysis (% of total)60.3 ± 1.347.3 ± 2.0cData are significantly different from pore mutant (HuFtH L138P) or transfection control: ***, p < 0.005, and *, p < 0.05.***Data are significantly different from pore mutant (HuFtH L138P) or transfection control: ***, p < 0.005, and *, p < 0.05.54.6 ± 1.9a The data are average from three independent experimen"

The PKA inhibitor H-89 abrogates the effect of β1 integrin function-blocking antibodies on β3 integrin serine phosphorylation and EC-rα4LN fragment binding. β3 integrin contains a serine residue at position 752.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing wild type or β3S752A integrin attach robustly to ligand. CHO cells expressing β3S752D integrin do not. Because the β3 cytoplasmic tail lacks a PKA consensus site, it is unlikely that PKA acts directly on β3 integrin.

Treatment of ECs with β1 integrin function-blocking antibodies significantly increases phosphorylation of inhibitor-1. Furthermore, blocking PP1 activity pharmacologically inhibits αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion to the rα4LN fragment when both PKA and β1 integrin function are inhibited.

Angiogenesis is a complex process that not only depends on growth factors and their receptors but is also influenced by integrin-extracellular matrix interactions. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors for matrix molecules (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). They play central roles in complex cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation via their interactions with the extracellular matrix and ability to regulate various signaling pathways (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar, 2Calderwood D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Integrin heterodimers exist in inactive and active conformations. High resolution microscopic and crystal structure analyses of αvβ3 integrin have shed light on the structural requirements that are involved (3Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 4Hynes R.O. Nat.

These studies demonstrate that integrins exists in two major conformations, a closed conformation, which has a low affinity for ligand, and an open conformation, which has a high ligand affinity (3Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 4Hynes R.O. Nat.

In general, integrins default to a low affinity state in cells. However, this is not always the case, and ultimately the activity of an integrin is influenced by the cellular environment (3Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 4Hynes R.O. Nat.

Indeed, activation of an integrin may occur when a cell is stimulated by extracellular signals (outside-in signaling) and may also be regulated by cytoplasmic signals (inside-out signaling) (1Hynes R.O.

Moreover, the ability of integrins to respond to both cytoplasmic and extracellular signals and undergo rapid changes in affinity for extracellular matrix components and other cell surface receptors is an essential aspect of development, wound healing, the immune response, angiogenesis, and metastasis (3Takagi J.

Most cells express more than one set of integrin heterodimers, and it is now established that integrin functions are regulated, at least in part, by a process some have termed “integrin cross-talk” (9Blystone S.D.

For example, ligation of one integrin by extracellular matrix may result in negative modulation of a different set of integrins via a trans-dominant regulatory mechanism (14Diaz-Gonzalez F.

In leukocytes, αvβ3 integrin inhibits α5β1 integrin-mediated phagocytosis and cell migration via a calcium calmodulin II-dependent mechanism (15Blystone S.D. Slater S.E. Williams M.P. Crow M.T. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, ligation of αIIβ3 integrin is known to block the functions of α5β1 and α2β1 integrin (14Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the interaction between endothelial cells and matrix ligands is complex and is regulated by cross-talk between β1 integrin containing heterodimers and αvβ3 integrin (16Gonzalez A.M. Gonzales M. Herron S.G. Nagavarapu U. Hopkinson S.B. Tsuruta D. Jones J.C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16075-16080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

However, the precise molecular mechanism by which β1 integrin-containing heterodimers are able to regulate αvβ3 integrin and vice versa has not been elucidated. The focus of this study was to dissect the molecular mechanism via which αvβ3 integrin-matrix ligand interaction is regulated in endothelial cells by β1 integrin. Cell Culture—Immortalized human bone marrow endothelial cells (TrHBMEC) were kindly provided by Drs. Babette Weksler (Cornell Medical School) and Denise Paulin (Universite Paris VII and Institute Pasteur, Paris, France). These were derived by immortalizing human bone marrow endothelial cells with a construct encoding the large T antigen of SV40 under the control of a truncated human vimentin gene promoter. The transformed cell line retained all of the characteristics of primary endothelial cells, including expression of cell surface markers such as von Willebrand factor, P-selectin, CD31, CD34, CD44, and intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (25Schweitzer K.M. Vicart P. Delouis C. Paulin D. Dräger A.M. Langenhuijsen M.M.A.C. Weksler B.B. Lab. Investig. 1997; 76: 25-36PubMed Google Scholar). TrHBMEC cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1× RPMI vitamins. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in F-12:modified Ham's media and 5% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the αvβ3 integrin heterodimer (LM609), αvβ5 (P1F6), β1-integrin subunit (6S6), and rabbit polyclonal antibody against αv integrin (AB1930) were obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Goat polyclonal anti-β3 integrin IgG (N-20) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against phosphoserine (PSR-45) and phosphotyrosine (PY20) were obtained from Sigma. Anti-GFP mouse monoclonal antibody was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Mouse anti-HA.11 antibody was from Babco (Richmond, CA). Secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Polyclonal antibodies against inhibitor-1/dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32), phospho-inhibitor-1/DARPP-32, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), and phospho-VASP were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA). Matrix Proteins and Integrins—Human fibronectin was purchased from BD Biosciences. Human vitronectin was obtained from Calbiochem. They were used according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The recombinant α4LN fragment, consisting of a portion of the G1 and G2 subdomains (residues 919–1207), was isolated from bacterial extracts as described previously (16Gonzalez A.M. Gonzales M. Herron S.G. Nagavarapu U. Hopkinson S.B. Tsuruta D. Jones J.C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16075-16080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). αvβ3 and α3β1 integrin heterodimers were purchased from Chemicon International. Their purity was routinely assessed by SDS-PAGE prior to use. Dr. Simon Goodman (Merck) generously provided recombinant ΔTMαvβ3 that lacks both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the αv and β3 integrin subunits. This integrin is believed to be in a constitutively active state (high affinity state for ligand binding) (26Mehta R.J. Diefenbach B. Brown A. Cullen E. Jonczyk A. Gussow D. Luckenbach G.A. Goodman S.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 1998: 861-869Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In solution, ΔTMαvβ3 integrin displays all of the properties of αvβ3 integrin purified from human placenta. It binds specifically to vitronectin and fibronectin in a cation-dependent manner (26Mehta R.J. Diefenbach B. Brown A. Cullen E. Jonczyk A. Gussow D. Luckenbach G.A. Goodman S.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 1998: 861-869Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Most importantly, recombinant αvβ3 retains its ligand specificity. It fails to bind to laminin-111 or laminin-332. 3A. M. Gonzalez, J. Claiborne, and J. C. R. Jones, unpublished data. Cell Adhesion Studies—Wells of 96-well non-tissue culture treated plates (Sarstedt, Newton, NC) were coated with 5 ng/μl of the recombinant α4LN fragment or 2 ng/μl vitronectin for 1 h at 37 °C. Each well was rinsed three times and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Endothelial cells plated on 100-mm dishes were treated with various pharmacologic inhibitors as indicated. Cell suspensions (1.0 × 106 cells/ml) were treated with integrin antibodies and control, isotype-matched immunoglobulins for 10–30 min at 37 °C. 100 μl of each cell suspension (e.g. 1.0 × 105 cells in 100 μl) was added to 96-well plates coated with extracellular matrix. After 1 h at 37 °C, the wells were washed extensively with PBS to remove nonadhering cells, and then adherent cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were incubated at room temperature with crystal violet for 15 min and then solubilized with 1% SDS. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured with a Vmax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). On average, for control IgG-treated endothelial cells, 96% (e.g. 9.5 × 104 cells/well) of cells added to each well attached to coated surfaces. This value was normalized such that 100% cell adhesion represents the adhesion measured of endothelial cells treated with IgG control. Values were expressed as percent relative to control (100%) ± S.D. Each experiment was conducted three times with duplicate samples per condition. Chemical Inhibitors—The inhibitors, H-89, calyculin, and sodium orthovanadate, were obtained from Sigma. All other inhibitors, including ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632), calmodulin kinase II inhibitor (KN-93), bisindolylmaleimide I (GF 109203X), and wortmannin, were obtained from Calbiochem. Constructs—The construct expressing the integrin-binding domain of talin (residues 206–405) spanning the subdomains F2 and F3 of the talin FERM (Four-point-one, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) domain was a kind gift from Dr. David Calderwood (Yale University, New Haven, CT) (2Calderwood D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A plasmid expressing full-length GFP-tagged β3 integrin subunit was prepared as described previously (27Tsuruta D. Gonzales M. Hopkinson S.B. Otey C. Khuon S. Goldman R.D. Jones J.C.R. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mutations at position serine 752 in β3 integrin cDNA were generated using the QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), following the procedure of the manufacturer. Plasmids were used to transform XL10-Gold ultracompetent cells and were plated in selective media. Plasmids in positive clones were isolated using Wizard Plus Miniprep DNA purification system (Promega, WI) and sequenced using Big Dye chemistry on an ABI Prism automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, CA) to confirm the presence of the appropriate point mutation. Plasmid DNA was purified using the GenEluteHP Plasmid MaxiPrep kit (Sigma). Inhibitor-1 was cloned into a bicistronic adenoviral vector, together with GFP protein. This vector was a generous gift of Thomas Eschenhagen (Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). 293A cells were infected with adenoviral vector. Approximately 24 h after infection, the adenovirus-containing 293A cells were harvested and lysed to prepare a crude viral stock. The resultant viral stock was amplified and tittered. Transfection and Adenoviral Infection—CHO cells were transfected with constructs expressing GFP-tagged wild type β3 integrin or β3 integrin bearing point mutants at serine 752 using the calcium/phosphate method described previously (16Gonzalez A.M. Gonzales M. Herron S.G. Nagavarapu U. Hopkinson S.B. Tsuruta D. Jones J.C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16075-16080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were selected with G418 and gated for GFP expression by flow cytometry. In the case of adenoviral infection, endothelial cells were incubated in virus at 37 °C overnight. The virus-containing medium was then removed, and cells were fed with fresh medium, followed by incubation at 37 °C. Greater than 80% infection rates were obtained in each of our studies. Biotinylation Assay—Surface proteins in CHO cells were analyzed following biotinylation. Briefly, endothelial cells were rinsed with cold PBS and incubated with 0.25 mg/ml biotin (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. Cells were rinsed once with cold PBS and blocked with 100 mm glycine for 20 min on ice. Cells were trypsinized, rinsed with cold PBS, and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (1% Brij 97, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 supplemented with protease inhibitors). Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and passed through a 25-gauge syringe, and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. The lysate was then incubated with 50 μl of streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with cell lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and processed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels following standard procedures (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose, which was subsequently processed for Western blotting as described previously (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1988: 18.60-18.75Google Scholar). ELISAs—Wells of 96-well non-tissue culture-treated plates were coated with protein at varying concentrations for 18 h at 4 °C. Each well was rinsed three times and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Soluble integrin heterodimers were diluted in binding buffer (25 mm Tris buffer, 150 nm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) or in physiologic cation binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm MnCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) as indicated and added to each well at the concentrations shown. After incubating for 90 min at 37 °C wells were rinsed three times in binding buffer and appropriate mouse monoclonal anti-integrin antibody was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were then rinsed three times in PBS, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was added to the wells for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were rinsed three times in PBS, and 200 μl of substrate (p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), diluted in ELISA buffer to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml) was added per well. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured with a Vmax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 10 mm EDTA to binding buffer. Specific binding was obtained by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding (total binding - nonspecific binding). Samples were assayed in duplicate, and data are expressed as specific binding ± S.E. The experiment was conducted three times. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Endothelial cells from 100-mm dishes were trypsinized, and the cell suspension was treated with anti-β1 function-blocking antibody, 6S6, or control mouse IgG for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and rinsed with cold PBS and resuspended with 1.0 ml of cell lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate. Cell lysis buffer was supplemented with 250 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) per 5 ml of lysis buffer and phosphatase inhibitors, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm NaVO4 just before use. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and passed through a 25-gauge syringe, and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. The lysate was then incubated with 4 μl of LM609 antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by 100 μl of 50% slurry of protein G beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and resuspended with 30 μl of 2× SDS sample preparation buffer. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and proteins were separated on 7.5–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels following standard procedures. Gels were either stained or separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, which was subsequently processed for Western blotting as described previously (16Gonzalez A.M. Gonzales M. Herron S.G. Nagavarapu U. Hopkinson S.B. Tsuruta D. Jones J.C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16075-16080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A Activity Assay—Endothelial cells were serum-starved and plated in serum-free media on tissue culture plates coated with 6S6, a β1-specific monoclonal antibody or control IgG. After 10 min, cells were washed once with cold PBS and lysed with hypotonic extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell extracts were sonicated, and debris was removed by centrifugation. Extracts were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 2× PK buffer (26.7 mm α-glycerol phosphate, 7.8 mm sodium fluoride, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 1.5 mm theophylline, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, with 5% phosphoric acid). PKA activity was determined by the incorporation of phosphate in Leu-Arg-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total PKA activity was measured in the presence of 10 μm cAMP. Nonspecific activity was determined by addition of 2 μm protein kinase A inhibitor, a PKA-specific inhibitor to the reaction mixture. Data are expressed as percent of total PKA activity ± S.E. Samples were assayed in triplicate for each condition and quantified on a scintillation counter. The PKA assay was repeated three times. αvβ3 Integrin and α3β1 Integrin Protein Bind Distinct Sites within a Recombinant Fragment of the α4-Laminin Subunit—In a previous study we demonstrated that a recombinant fragment (residues 919–1207) of the α4-laminin (rα4LN fragment), lacking an RGD motif, contains binding sites for several integrin heterodimers (16Gonzalez A.M. Gonzales M. Herron S.G. Nagavarapu U. Hopkinson S.B. Tsuruta D. Jones J.C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16075-16080Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whether or not these sites function as bona fide integrin interaction domains in intact laminin heterotrimers containing the α4 subunit remains to be determined. Nonetheless, to confirm that it contained a non-RGD-binding site for αvβ3 integrin binding, we first assayed whether recombinant αvβ3 integrin interacted with the rα4LN fragment in physiologic cation concentrations (1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). The recombinant αvβ3 integrin possesses neither the transmembrane nor cytoplasmic domains and is considered to be in a constitutively active form (26Mehta R.J. Diefenbach B. Brown A. Cullen E. Jonczyk A. Gussow D. Luckenbach G.A. Goodman S.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 1998: 861-869Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It bound to the rα4LN fragment and fibronectin, to which αvβ3 integrin is known to bind in an RGD-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). This binding was specific because it was reversed by addition of 10 mm EDTA. Addition of this chelator is used routinely to block the binding of integrins to extracellular matrix proteins irrespective of whether they contain an RGD integrin-binding site (30Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Next, we determined whether the rα4LN fragment contained distinct binding sites for αvβ3 and α3β1 integrin. To optimize binding, 0.5 mm MnCl2 was included in the assays. Purified, soluble αvβ3 integrin was added to 96-well plates precoated with the rα4LN fragment in the presence of increasing concentrations of α3β1 integrin. Binding of αvβ3 integrin to the fragment was assessed by solid-phase binding studies. As indicated in Fig. 2A, binding of αvβ3 integrin to the rα4LN fragment was not reduced with increasing concentrations of α3β1 integrin protein indicating that α3β1 integrin did not compete with αvβ3 integrin for binding. Similar results were obtained when α3β1 integrin binding to the rα4LN fragment was assessed in the presence of increasing concentrations of αvβ3 integrin protein (Fig. 2B). Because the rα4LN fragment possesses a number of distinct sites for RGD-independent integrin interaction, we have used it in subsequent studies as a tool to identify the molecular mechanisms underpinning integrin cross-talk. β1 Integrin Regulates αvβ3 Ligand Binding In Endothelial Cells via an Inside-out Mechanism—Although α3β1 and αvβ3 integrins bound the rα4LN fragment at distinct sites, in a cell adhesion assay these integrins failed to compensate for each"

https://openalex.org/W2053221328,"The Shaker family voltage-dependent potassium channels (Kv1) are expressed in a wide variety of cells and are essential for cellular excitability. In humans, loss-of-function mutations of Kv1 channels lead to hyperexcitability and are directly linked to episodic ataxia and atrial fibrillation. All Kv1 channels assemble with β subunits (Kvβs), and certain Kvβs, for example Kvβ1, have an N-terminal segment that closes the channel by the N-type inactivation mechanism. In principle, dissociation of Kvβ1, although never reported, should eliminate inactivation and thus potentiate Kv1 current. We found that cortisone increases rat Kv1 channel activity by binding to Kvβ1. A crystal structure of the Kvβ-cortisone complex was solved to 1.82-Å resolution and revealed novel cortisone binding sites. Further studies demonstrated that cortisone promotes dissociation of Kvβ. The new mode of channel modulation may be explored by native or synthetic ligands to fine-tune cellular excitability."
