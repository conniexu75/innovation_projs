https://openalex.org/W2017692041,"With the recognition of the central role of mitochondria in apoptosis, there is a need to develop specific tools to manipulate mitochondrial function within cells. Here we report on the development of a novel antioxidant that selectively blocks mitochondrial oxidative damage, enabling the roles of mitochondrial oxidative stress in different types of cell death to be inferred. This antioxidant, named mitoQ, is a ubiquinone derivative targeted to mitochondria by covalent attachment to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation through an aliphatic carbon chain. Due to the large mitochondrial membrane potential, the cation was accumulated within mitochondria inside cells, where the ubiquinone moiety inserted into the lipid bilayer and was reduced by the respiratory chain. The ubiquinol derivative thus formed was an effective antioxidant that prevented lipid peroxidation and protected mitochondria from oxidative damage. After detoxifying a reactive oxygen species, the ubiquinol moiety was regenerated by the respiratory chain enabling its antioxidant activity to be recycled. In cell culture studies, the mitochondrially localized antioxidant protected mammalian cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis but not from apoptosis induced by staurosporine or tumor necrosis factor-α. This was compared with untargeted ubiquinone analogs, which were ineffective in preventing apoptosis. These results suggest that mitochondrial oxidative stress may be a critical step in apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide but not for apoptosis induced by staurosporine or tumor necrosis factor-α. We have shown that selectively manipulating mitochondrial antioxidant status with targeted and recyclable antioxidants is a feasible approach to investigate the role of mitochondrial oxidative damage in apoptotic cell death. This approach will have further applications in investigating mitochondrial dysfunction in a range of experimental models.

Mitochondria are also central to activating apoptosis and oxidative damage can lead to cell death, however, the significance of mitochondrial oxidative damage for cell death is unclear (6Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 7Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rignon M. Ann. Rev.

One approach to this problem is to selectively target antioxidants to mitochondria (9Murphy M.P. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 326-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 10Murphy M.P. Smith R.A.J. Adv.

A. 1998; 95: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). This should allow the relative importance of mitochondrial and cytoplasmic oxidative stress for cell death to be distinguished, and also enable the contribution of mitochondrial damage to aging, diabetes, and cancer to be investigated in cell and animal models. Derivatives of ubiquinol are promising antioxidants to target to mitochondria (11Matthews R.T. Yang L. Browne S. Bail M. Beal M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 12Lass A. Forster M.J. Sohal R.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1357-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In mammals ubiquinone comprises a 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methylbenzoquinone core with a hydrophobic 45- to 50-carbon chain at the 6 position (13Crane F.L. Barr R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18C: 137-165Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Crane F.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ubiquinone is a respiratory chain component buried within the lipid core of the inner membrane where it accepts two electrons from complexes I or II becoming reduced to ubiquinol, which then donates electrons to complex III (14Crane F.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The ubiquinone pool in vivo is largely reduced and ubiquinol is an effective antioxidant, as well as being a mobile electron carrier (15Lass A. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Kagan V.E. Serbinova E.A. Stoyanovsky D.A. Khwaja S. Packer L.

Ubiquinol acts as an antioxidant by donating a hydrogen atom from one of its hydroxyl groups to a lipid peroxyl radical, thereby decreasing lipid peroxidation within the mitochondrial inner membrane (18Ernster L. Forsmark P. Nordenbrand K. Biofactors. 1992; 3: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar, 19Takada M. Ikenoya S. Yuzuriha T. Katayama K.

A. 1993; 90: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The ubisemiquinone radicals thus formed disproportionate to ubiquinone and ubiquinol (21Land E.J. Swallow A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1890-1894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or react with oxygen to form superoxide and ubiquinone thereby transferring the radical to the aqueous phase for detoxification by superoxide dismutase and peroxidases (17Maguire J.J. Wilson D.S. Packer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21462-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ingold K.U. Bowry V.W. Stocker R. Walling C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The respiratory chain then recycles ubiquinone back to ubiquinol to restore its antioxidant function. Vitamin E is another important antioxidant within the mitochondrial inner membrane, and the tocopheroxyl radical thus formed is regenerated to active vitamin E by reaction with ubiquinol or ubisemiquinone (15Lass A. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Maguire J.J. Wilson D.S. Packer L. J. Biol.

Therefore, in vivo ubiquinol probably acts as an antioxidant by direct reaction with peroxyl radicals and by regenerating vitamin E (16Kagan V.E. Serbinova E.A. Stoyanovsky D.A. Khwaja S. Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Maguire J.J. Wilson D.S. Packer L. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The low solubility of ubiquinone in water makes it difficult to usein vitro, and animals must be fed ubiquinone-enriched diets for several weeks to increase levels in subsequently isolated mitochondria (11Matthews R.T. Yang L. Browne S. Bail M. Beal M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 14Crane F.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, to manipulate mitochondrial ubiquinone content in vitro we synthesized a ubiquinone analog selectively targeted to mitochondria by addition of a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation. Such lipophilic cations easily permeate lipid bilayers and accumulate in mitochondria within cells, driven by the large mitochondrial membrane potential (9Murphy M.P. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 326-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar,10Murphy M.P. Smith R.A.J. Adv.

To synthesize 11-bromoundecanoic peroxide (1) 11-bromoundecanoic acid (4.00 g, 15.1 mmol) and SOCl2 (1.6 ml, 21.5 mmol) were heated at 90 °C for 15 min (25Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4096-4101Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Excess SOCl2 was removed by distillation under reduced pressure (15 mm Hg, 90 °C) and the residue (IR,1 1799 cm-1) was dissolved in diethyl ether (20 ml) and cooled to 0 °C. Hydrogen peroxide (30%, 1.8 ml) was added, followed by dropwise addition of pyridine (1.4 ml) over 45 min, then diethyl ether (10 ml) was added and after 1 h at room temperature the product was diluted with diethyl ether (150 ml), washed with H2O (2 × 70 ml), 1.2m HCl (2 × 70 ml), H2O (70 ml), 0.5m NaHCO3 (2 × 70 ml), and H2O (70 ml). After drying over MgSO4 the solvent was removed at room temperature under reduced pressure, giving crude 1 as a white solid (3.51 g), which was used without delay. IR (Nujol mull) 1810, 1782 cm-1. 6-(10-Bromodecyl)ubiquinone (2) was synthesized by stirring crude 1 (3.51 g, 12.5 mmol), 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (1.31 g, 7.19 mmol, Aldrich), and acetic acid (60 ml) for 20 h at 100 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was diluted with diethyl ether (600 ml), washed with H2O (2 × 400 ml), 1 m HCl (2 × 450 ml), 0.5 m NaHCO3 (2 × 450 ml), and H2O (2 × 400 ml), and dried over MgSO4. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure gave a reddish solid (4.31 g). Column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with CH2Cl2, gave 2 as a red oil (809 mg, 28%) and unreacted 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (300 mg, 1.6 mmol, 13%). 2: TLC: R F(CH2Cl2, diethyl ether 20:1) 0.46; IR (film) 2928, 2854, 1650, 1611, 1456, 1288 cm-1; λmax(ethanol): 278 nm; 1H NMR (299.9 MHz) 3.99 (s, 6H, 2 x-OCH 3), 3.41 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H, -CH 2-Br), 2.45 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 2H, ubquinone-CH 2-), 2.02, (s, 3H, -CH 3). 1.89 (quin, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H, -CH 2 -CH2-Br), 1.42–1.28 (m, 14H, -(CH 2)7-) ppm;13C NMR (125.7 MHz) 184.7 (C = O), 184.2 (C = O), 144.3 (2C, ring), 143.1 (ring), 138.7 (ring), 61.2 (2× -OCH3), 34.0 (-CH2-), 32.8 (-CH2-), 29.8 (-CH2-), 29.4 (2× -CH2-), 29.3 (-CH2-), 28.7 (2× -CH2-), 28.2 (-CH2-), 26.4 (-CH2-), 11.9 (-CH3) ppm.

To form the quinol, 6-(10-bromodecyl)-ubiquinol (3), NaBH4 (295 mg, 7.80 mmol) was added to 2 (649 mg, 1.62 mmol) in methanol (6 ml) and stirred under argon for 10 min (Scheme FS1). Excess NaBH4 was quenched with 5% HCl (2 ml), diluted with diethyl ether (40 ml), washed with 1.2 m HCl (40 ml), saturated NaCl (2 × 40 ml), and dried over MgSO4. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure gave 3 as a yellow oily solid (541 mg, 83%). 1H NMR (299.9 MHz) 5.31 (s, 1H, -OH), 5.26 (s, 1H, -OH), 3.89 (s, 6H, 2× -OCH 3), 3.41 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 2H, -CH 2-Br), 2.59 (t, J = 7.7 Hz, 2H ubquinol-CH 2-), 2.15 (s,3H, CH 3), 1.85 (quin,J = 7.4 Hz, 2H, -CH 2-CH2-Br), 1.44–1.21 (m, 14H, -(CH 2)7-) ppm. To synthesize 10-(6′-ubiquinolyl)decyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (4), triphenylphosphine (387 mg, 1.48 mmol), 3(541 mg, 1.34 mmol), and ethanol (95%, 2.5 ml) were sealed under argon in a 15-ml Kimax tube and stirred in the dark for 88 h at 85 °C. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure gave an oily orange residue, which was dissolved in CH2Cl2(2 ml). Addition of diethyl ether (20 ml) gave a suspension, and after 5 min the supernatant was decanted. The residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (2 ml) followed by addition of diethyl ether (20 ml), and the supernatant was decanted. The CH2Cl2/diethyl ether extraction was repeated twice more, and residual solvent was removed under reduced pressure, giving crude 4 as a cream solid (507 mg). 1H NMR (299.9 MHz) 7.9–7.6 (m, 15H, -P+ Ph 3), 3.89 (s, 6H, 2× -OCH 3), 3.91–3.77 (m, 2H, -CH 2-P+Ph3), 2.57 (t,J = 7.8 Hz, 2H ubquinol-CH 2-), 2.14 (s, 3H, CH 3), 1.6–1.2 (m, 16H, -(CH 2)8-) ppm. 31P NMR (121.4 MHz) 25.1 ppm. Crude 4 (200 mg) was oxidized to 10-(6′-ubiquinonyl)decyltriphenyl-phosphonium bromide (5) by stirring in CDCl3 at room temperature under an oxygen atmosphere. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (5 ml), diethyl ether (15 ml) was added, and the resultant suspension was stirred for 5 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the CH2Cl2/diethyl ether precipitation was repeated twice more. Residual solvent was removed under reduced pressure, giving crude 5 as a brown sticky solid (173 mg).

To synthesize 3H-enriched 10-(6′-ubiquinolyl)decyltriphenylphosphonium bromide, triphenylphosphine (4.09 mg; 15.6 μmol), 3 (6.3 mg; 15.6 μmol), and 250 μl of ethanol containing [3H]triphenylphosphine (74 μCi, Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA, 1 Ci/mmol) were sealed under argon in a Kimax tube and stirred in the dark for 55 h at 80 °C. After cooling the product was precipitated by addition of diethyl ether, and the orange solid was dissolved in a few drops of CH2Cl2and precipitated with diethyl ether. This was repeated four times to remove unreacted triphenylphosphine and 3. Two separate syntheses of 3H-enriched 10-(6′-ubiquinonyl)decyltriphenylphosphonium bromide were carried out giving products of 2.6 and 2.46 mCi/mmol, respectively, which gave the same results in experiments with isolated mitochondria, and their UV absorption spectra were as expected for a mixture of 4 and5. TLC followed by scintillation counting of sectioned plates and comparison with the R F values of the unlabeled compounds confirmed radiopurity. Stock solutions containing a mixture of 4 and 5 in ethanol were stored at -80 °C, and their concentrations were confirmed by 31P NMR. Fully oxidized solutions were generated by incubation in basic 95% ethanol on ice (13Crane F.L. Barr R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18C: 137-165Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or with beef heart mitochondrial membranes at room temperature. Both procedures gave an extinction coefficient of 10,400 m-1 cm-1 at 275 nm for the quinone, with shoulders at 263 and 268 nm corresponding to the triphenylphosphonium moiety (26Smith R.A.J. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Murphy M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 27Burns R.J. Smith R.A.J. Murphy M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and a broad shoulder at 290 nm due to the quinone (13Crane F.L. Barr R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18C: 137-165Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Reduction with NaBH4 gave the quinol, which had local maxima at 290 nm (ε = 1800 m-1 cm-1) and at 268 nm (ε = 3000 m-1 cm-1) (27Burns R.J. Smith R.A.J. Murphy M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Δεox-red at 275 nm in 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.2, was 7000 m-1cm-1. The quinone extinction coefficient (10,400m-1 cm-1 at 275 nm) was slightly lower than that reported for other quinones (12,250m-1 cm-1) in aqueous buffer (28Cabrini L. Landi L. Pasquali P. Lenaz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This difference was not due to an intermolecular interaction between the phosphonium and the quinone, because the absorbances of2 and the simple phosphonium methyltriphenylphosphonium (TPMP) were additive when 50 μm of each were mixed together in either ethanol or aqueous buffer. To prepare mitoquinol an ethanolic solution was diluted in ∼0.5–1 ml of water and a few grains of NaBH4 were added. After incubation on ice in the dark for 5 min, excess NaBH4 was quenched with 5% HBr (0.2 ml) and the quinol was extracted into CH2Cl2(3 × 0.5 ml). The extract was then washed with water and 2m NaCl, then the CH2Cl2 was removed under a stream of nitrogen. The pale yellow solid residue was dissolved in acidified 96% ethanol. The yield was typically 70–80% and, as the quinol slowly oxidized in air, it was freshly prepared and stored on ice under argon in the dark. To determine partition coefficients, compounds were added to 2 ml each of 1-octanol-saturated PBS and PBS-saturated 1-octanol then shaken at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. After separation by centrifugation, the amounts in each phase were determined by absorption relative to standard curves in 1-octanol-saturated PBS or PBS-saturated 1-octanol. Rat liver mitochondria were prepared by homogenization followed by differential centrifugation (29Chappell J.B. Hansford R.G. Birnie G.D. Subcellular Components: Preparation and Fractionation. Butterworths, London1972: 77-91Google Scholar). Beef heart mitochondria were isolated by standard procedures, and membrane fragments were prepared by sonication followed by centrifugation (30Smith A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 81-86Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the biuret assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (31Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endogenous ubiquinone was removed from lyophilized beef heart mitochondria by pentane extraction, and complete extraction was confirmed by the inability of these mitochondria to oxidize NADH in the absence of added Q1 (13Crane F.L. Barr R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 18C: 137-165Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For respiration measurements, rat liver mitochondria (2 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in KCl medium (120 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) at 25 °C supplemented with respiratory substrates and 1 mm phosphate in a 3-ml oxygen electrode (Rank Brothers, Bottisham, Cambridge, UK). After measuring the rate of coupled respiration 200 μmADP was added, the rate of phosphorylating respiration was measured and then FCCP (300 nm) was added and the rate of uncoupled respiration determined. To measure membrane potential, rat liver mitochondria (2 mg of protein/ml) were incubated for 3 min in 0.5 ml of KCl medium supplemented with nigericin (1 μg/ml), 5 mmeach of glutamate and malate, 1 μm TPMP, and 100 nCi/ml [3H]TPMP. After incubation the mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation, the radioactivity in the pellet and supernatant were measured by scintillation counting, and the membrane potential was calculated using the Nernst equation, assuming a mitochondrial volume of 0.5 μl/mg of protein and that 60% of the intramitochondrial TPMP was membrane-bound (32Scott I.D. Nicholls D.G. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 33Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The uptake of [3H]mitoQ by rat liver mitochondria was measured under the same conditions. Scanning spectra and kinetic measurements were made with an Aminco DW-2000 dual beam spectrophotometer using matched 1-ml quartz cuvettes at 20 °C. Beef heart mitochondrial membranes and freeze-thawed yeast mitochondria were incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. Rat liver mitochondria were incubated in KCl medium. To measure thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), rat liver mitochondria (2 mg of protein/ml) were incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 45 min in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Then 0.8-ml aliquots were mixed with 400 μl of 0.5% thiobarbituric acid in 35% HClO4, heated at 100 °C for 15 min, diluted with 3 ml of water, and extracted into 3 ml of n-butanol. TBARS were determined fluorometrically (λexcite = 515 nm; λemission = 553 nm) and expressed as nanomoles of MDA by comparison with standard solutions of 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane processed as above. Prior to analyzing samples, their mitoQ contents were brought to the same concentration to eliminate differences in MDA formation during heating and processing. To measure the membrane potential after exposure to oxidative damage, mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in KCl medium, and their membrane potentials were determined as described above. To measure cis-parinaric acid oxidation, mitochondria (2 mg of protein/ml) were suspended in a 3-ml fluorimeter cuvette in 100 mm KCl and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, at 37 °C. The oxidation of cis-parinaric acid (Molecular Probes) was monitored fluorometrically (λexcite = 324 nm; λemission = 413 nm). A control experiment showed that titration of cis-parinaric acid into a mitochondrial suspension initially increased the fluorescence as it partitioned into membranes, but the increase became nonlinear after about 3 μm and declined above 10 μm due to self quenching (34Tribble D.L. van den Berg J.J.M.

Therefore, 3 μm cis-parinaric acid was used for all experiments. Peroxynitrite was synthesized from acidified H2O2 and NaNO2 in a simple flow reactor as described previously (35Packer M.A. Murphy M.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), concentrated by freeze fractionation and stock solutions in 1.5 m NaOH quantitated [ε302 = 1.67 mm-1.cm-1 (36Hughes M.N. Nicklin H.G. J. Chem. Soc. 1968; A: 450-452Crossref Google Scholar)]. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used were: CY4-ΔCOQ3 (MATaura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 trp1-1 ade2-1 his3-11 can1-100 coq3::HIS3), kindly supplied by Prof. Ian W. Dawes, University of New South Wales, Australia (37Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and CEN.PK2–1C-ΔCOQ3 (CEN.PK2–1Ccoq3::LEU2) kindly supplied by Prof. Cathy Clarke, UCLA. Both ΔCOQ3 yeast strains were auxotrophic for ubiquinone when grown on nonfermentable medium. Yeasts were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks at 28 °C under air with shaking at 200 rpm. For growth analysis, cultures in YPD (1% bacto yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% dextrose) were diluted into YPEG (1% bacto yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 3% ethanol, 3% glycerol) to anA 600 of 0.1 and then grown in the dark while theA 600 was monitored. For studies on yeast mitochondria, mitochondria were prepared from lactate-grown yeast of the CY4-ΔCOQ3 and CY4 wild type strains (38Glick B.S. Pon L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, lactate-grown yeast were isolated by centrifugation, the cell wall was removed by digestion with Zymolyase, spheroplasts were homogenized, and mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. Mitochondria were stored at -80 °C in 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. For spectrophotometric assays, yeast mitochondria were washed in 0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES and freeze-thawed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. Human osteosarcoma 143B cells were cultured at 37 °C under humidified 95% air/5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum. For toxicity studies, cells were grown to confluence in 24-well tissue culture dishes and incubated for 24 h with DMEM/serum containing the compound. The supernatants were then harvested, and the amount of LDH released was assayed and compared with that present in untreated wells lysed with 0.1% Triton. For uptake studies cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and 5 μm[3H]mitoQ. After incubation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the radioactivity in the pellet was quantitated by scintillation counting. For digitonin fractionation, cells were incubated as above, and then 500 μl of the cell suspension was mixed rapidly with 1.2 ml of ice-cold 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm MOPS pH 6.7, 3 mm EDTA, and 1 mg of digitonin, then 1 ml was layered onto 350 μl of oil (66% silicone oil/34% dioctyl pthalate) over 100 μl of 500 mm sucrose, 0.1% Triton and separated into mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions by centrifugation. The two fractions were assayed for citrate synthase and LDH activity or for content of radioactivity by scintillation counting (39Burns R.J. Murphy M.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The Jurkat human T lymphocyte line was grown at 37 °C under humidified 95% air/5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum. Apoptosis was induced by addition of hydrogen peroxide (8Hampton M.B. Orenius S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Caspase activation in lysed cell pellets was measured fluorometrically by the cleavage of the peptide DEVD labeled with AMC (DEVD-AMC) and calibrated using an AMC standard curve (40Scarlett J.L.

The proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was quantitated by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining followed by detection of annexin-positive cells using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Column chromatography was on Silica Gel type 60, 200–400 mesh, 40–63 μm (Me"
https://openalex.org/W2061704745,"Autophagy is a process that involves the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components by the lysosomal/vacuolar system. In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an autophagosome is formed in the cytosol. The outer membrane of the autophagosome is fused with the vacuole, releasing the inner membrane structure, an autophagic body, into the vacuole. The autophagic body is subsequently degraded by vacuolar hydrolases. Taking advantage of yeast genetics, apg (autophagy-defective) mutants were isolated that are defective in terms of formation of autophagic bodies under nutrient starvation conditions. One of the APG gene products, Apg12p, is covalently attached to Apg5p via the C-terminal Gly of Apg12p as in the case of ubiquitylation, and this conjugation is essential for autophagy. Apg7p is a novel E1 enzyme essential for the Apg12p-conjugation system. In mammalian cells, the human Apg12p homolog (hApg12p) also conjugates with the human Apg5p homolog. In this study, the unique characteristics of hApg7p are shown. A two-hybrid experiment indicated that hApg12p interacts with hApg7p. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Cys(572) of hApg7p is an authentic active site cysteine residue essential for the formation of the hApg7p.hApg12p intermediate. Overexpression of hApg7p enhances the formation of the hApg5p.hApg12p conjugate, indicating that hApg7p is an E1-like enzyme essential for the hApg12p conjugation system. Cross-linking experiments and glycerol-gradient centrifugation analysis showed that the mammalian Apg7p homolog forms a homodimer as in yeast Apg7p. Each of three human Apg8p counterparts, i.e. the Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa, GABA(A) receptor-associated protein, and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, coimmunoprecipitates with hApg7p and conjugates with mutant hApg7p(C572S) to form a stable intermediate via an ester bond. These results indicate that hApg7p is an authentic protein-activating enzyme for hApg12p and the three Apg8p homologs."
https://openalex.org/W2114263087,"We have identified from mouse the first mammalian β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase (β-CD), a crucial enzyme in development and metabolism that governs the de novo entry of vitamin A from plant-derived precursors. β-CD is related to the retinal pigment epithelium-expressed protein RPE65 and belongs to a diverse family that includes the plant 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase and bacterial lignostilbene dioxygenases. β-CD expression in Escherichia coli cells engineered to produce β-carotene led to the accumulation of all-trans-retinal at the expense of β-carotene, confirming that β-CD catalyzed the central cleavage of this vitamin A precursor.

Non-provitamin A carotenoids were also cleaved, although with much lower activity. By Northern analysis, a 2.4-kilobase (kb) message was observed in liver, kidney, small intestine, and testis, tissues important in retinoid/carotenoid metabolism. This message encoded a 63-kDa cytosolic protein expressed in these tissues. A shorter transcript of 1.8 kb was found in testis and skin. Developmentally, the 2.4-kb mRNA was abundant at embryonic day 7, with lower expression at embryonic days 11, 13, and 15, suggesting a critical role for this enzyme in gastrulation.

Ward S.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 188: 73-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pattern formation (2Chen Y. Huang L. Russo A.F. Solursh M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10056-10059Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar,3Chen Y. Huang L. Solursh M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and vision (4Saari J.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2000; 41: 337-348PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoic acid, through its interaction with the nuclear retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor, profoundly affects cell differentiation and development. Because animals are unable to synthesize vitamin A de novo from endogenous isoprenoid precursors, they must instead derive it from cleavage of β-carotene and certain other carotenoids with an unsubstituted β-ring (e.g. γ- and α-carotenes, β-zeacarotene, and β-cryptoxanthin). It is generally accepted that central cleavage of β-carotene by a putative dioxygenase gives rise to two molecules of all-trans-retinal, whereas eccentric cleavage with subsequent processing leading to a single molecule of retinoic acid from an apocarotenal is quantitatively far less important (5Nagao A. During A. Hoshino C. Terao J. Olson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). β-Carotene cleavage activity is reported highest in the intestinal mucosa, but is found at high activity levels in liver, kidney, lung, and fat tissues, among other sites. However, an inability to purify the protein catalyzing this reaction has hindered thorough investigation of this crucial first step in vitamin A metabolism.Because of a loose similarity between the mammalian protein RPE65 and the neoxanthin cleavage enzymes of plants, our laboratories have considered the hypothesis that the putative β-CD1 would belong to an emerging family of carotenoid-cleaving dioxygenases known mainly from examples in plants (6Cunningham Jr., F.X. Gannt E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 557-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), but with members also in bacteria and Metazoa. The first described representative was a bacterial lignostilbene α,β-dioxygenase, which cleaves the central carbon–carbon double bond of lignostilbene, a bicyclic lignin model compound, into two molecules of vanillin (7Kamoda S. Saburi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The initial plant representative of this family is maize VP14, the neoxanthin cleavage enzyme of the abscisic acid pathway (8Tan B.C. Schwartz S.H. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12235-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) that is a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (9Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The essential similarity of these disparate reactions is shown in Fig. 1.The original animal representative of the family is RPE65, a protein restricted in its expression to the retinal pigment epithelium (10Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15751-15757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Harris E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the specific biochemical function of RPE65 is not yet known, it is required for the all-trans- to 11-cis-isomerization reaction that regenerates the 11-cis-retinal chromophore of rhodopsin in the visual cycle of the retina (12Redmond T.M., Yu, S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). A thematic feature of the eukaryotic members of the family therefore appears to be an interaction with carotenoids or carotenoid derivatives to cleave or otherwise alter conjugated carbon–carbon double bonds. We used iterative searching of the genomic and EST data bases to find genes encoding polypeptides similar in sequence to RPE65. We describe here the characterization of one such RPE65 homolog from mouse, detail the developmental and tissue specificity of its expression, and define its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. The protein does indeed cleave β-carotene to produce all-trans-retinal, is related, although not closely, to a β-CD recently identified from Drosophila melanogaster(13von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and is of the same family as the recently described chicken β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase (14Wyss A. Wirtz G. Woggon W. Brugger R. Wyss M. Friedlein A. Bachmann H. Hunziker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Identification of the mouse β-CD protein and its gene provides the requisite tools for study of early steps of mammalian carotenoid metabolism in an accessible model system and gives additional insights into an ancient family of retinoid/carotenoid-metabolizing enzymes.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have described the catalytic activity and tissue-specific expression pattern of a mouse β-CD. The protein clearly belongs to an extended family of dioxygenases that interact with carotenoids and other polyenes and that include the plant neoxanthin cleavage enzymes, the bacterial lignostilbene dioxygenases, and the vertebrate protein RPE65. The activity of mouse β-CD seen with alternative carotenoid substrates (Fig. 3) indicates that the specificity of the catalytic activity is centered more in the polyene chain of the substrate than at the end groups. This observation is in accord with the activities previously reported for crude tissue preparations (23Lakshmanan M.R. Pope J.L. Olson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 33: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Olson J.A. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1983: 371-412Google Scholar, 25Singh H. Cama H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 370: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, a more accurate and inclusive designation for the family as a whole may be the polyene chain dioxygenase family.The conserved histidines and acidic residues of the various polyene dioxygenase family members are likely to be involved in coordinating the iron required for activity in these enzymes (9Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 26Lakshman M.R. Okoh C. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 214: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The signature sequence, a run of acidic residues connected through a glycine to a hydrophobic tail, could be involved in electron transfer processes during catalysis. Although the precise enzymatic activity of RPE65 has not yet been determined, RPE65 is capable of binding ferrous iron 3S. Gentleman, unpublished data. and thus shares this characteristic as well as the signature sequence with other family members. The resemblance of RPE65 to the other dioxygenase family members and the fact that its absence prevents the retinal pigment epithelium-specific isomerization of all-trans- to 11-cis-retinol in the visual cycle (12Redmond T.M., Yu, S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) suggest a direct catalytic participation in the visual cycle.Although β-CD activity in partially purified preparations from various sources has been localized both to cytosolic and membrane fractions, the overwhelming consensus is that it is a cytosolic protein (23Lakshmanan M.R. Pope J.L. Olson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 33: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Olson J.A. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1983: 371-412Google Scholar, 25Singh H. Cama H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 370: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Wolf G. Nutr. Rev. 1995; 53: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as we also have found. However, an important aspect of the carotenoids and their derivatives as substrates is their lipophilicity (including a tendency to partition in membranes) and generally insoluble nature in aqueous solution. Interestingly, none of the polyene dioxygenase family members, including mouse β-CD, are predicted to be integral membrane proteins. However, the plant 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid cleavage enzymes are associated with chloroplast membranes (9Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The only metazoan member of the family whose biochemical properties have been examined in this respect is RPE65, which is a non-integral, microsomal membrane-associated protein, but can be separated from retinal pigment epithelium membranes by mild detergent or high salt extraction (11Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Harris E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RPE65 will specifically associate with phospholipid liposomes (28Tsilou E. Hamel C.P., Yu, S. Redmond T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is possible that mouse β-CD, despite its cytosolic nature, will also interact with membranes in the context of its physiological mechanism.The tissue distribution of mouse β-CD was, in general, as expected, although the level in the small intestine was somewhat weak. However, the β-CD activity of this tissue is concentrated in mature enterocytes (and is highest in the jejunum) (29Duszka C. Grolier P. Azim E.M. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Borel P. Azais-Braesco V. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2550-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which constitute a relatively small proportion of the total tissue used to provide the RNA for this blot. Thus, one possibility is that the weak signal in this tissue is due to dilution of the RNA with that from other cell types. Another possibility is that there is a tissue-specific β-CD in small intestine, in addition to the one described here. The testis also is active in the uptake and metabolism of carotenoids, as β-carotene and lycopene have been repeatedly demonstrated in testis (30Yamanushi T. Igarashi O. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1995; 41: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 31Kerti A. Bardos L. Acta Vet. Hung. 1999; 47: 95-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Stahl W. Schwarz W. Sundquist A.R. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Cleavage of β-carotene has been shown to be an important source of retinoic acid in vitro in testis as well as in small intestine, liver, kidney, and lung (33Napoli J.L. Race K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17372-17377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the high expression of β-CD in testis noted here is consistent with this finding. Napoli and Race (33Napoli J.L. Race K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17372-17377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that cleavage of β-carotene may be an important source of retinoic acid in target tissues such as testis and may play an under-appreciated role in retinoid homeostasis.Mouse β-CD has a low level of activity toward carotenoids other than β-carotene, including lycopene, observable in in vivoassays. As to its distribution, lycopene is accumulated primarily in liver, but also in intestine, prostate, and testis (34Froescheis O. Moalli S. Liechti H. Bausch J. J. Chromatogr. Biomed. Appl. 2000; 739: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and appears to have several biological activities (35Clinton S.K. Nutr. Rev. 1998; 56: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). For example, in a recent study, lycopene, but not its acycloretinoid derivative, was effective in stimulating gap junction communication (36Stahl W. von Laar J. Martin H.D. Emmerich T. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this case, the function of the dioxygenase with respect to lycopene might be to terminate its activity.The developmental expression of mouse β-CD is particularly intriguing, given its early elevated expression at embryonic day 7 and much reduced expression thereafter. At embryonic day 7, with the embryo proceeding into gastrulation, a number of retinoids and retinoid-interacting proteins are being expressed (37Ulven S.M. Gundersen T.E. Weedon M.S. Landaas V.O. Sakhi A.K. Fromm S.H. Geronimo B.A. Moskaug J.O. Blomhoff R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Analysis of endogenous retinoids in the mouse embryo (37Ulven S.M. Gundersen T.E. Weedon M.S. Landaas V.O. Sakhi A.K. Fromm S.H. Geronimo B.A. Moskaug J.O. Blomhoff R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) shows that all-trans-retinal is the first retinoid seen (at embryonic day 6.5), whereas both all-trans-retinoic acid and all-trans-retinol do not appear until embryonic day 7.5. In the mouse embryo, mRNAs of two dehydrogenases involved in retinoic acid production, alcohol dehydrogenase IV and aldehyde dehydrogenase I, are up-regulated between embryonic days 6.5 and 7.5 (37Ulven S.M. Gundersen T.E. Weedon M.S. Landaas V.O. Sakhi A.K. Fromm S.H. Geronimo B.A. Moskaug J.O. Blomhoff R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 38Ang H.L. Duester G. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the early accumulation of all-trans-retinal may be due to low level activity of alcohol dehydrogenase IV on maternally supplied all-trans-retinol, there may also be a contribution from the cleavage of β-carotene. Ulven et al. (37Ulven S.M. Gundersen T.E. Weedon M.S. Landaas V.O. Sakhi A.K. Fromm S.H. Geronimo B.A. Moskaug J.O. Blomhoff R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggested this possibility, an interpretation supported by our finding of high β-CD mRNA expression at embryonic day 7. Thus, the activity of β-CD could serve to produce all-trans-retinal from β-carotene, a nontoxic provitamin source of retinoids in the early embryo.The identification of mouse β-CD establishes the existence in mammals of an ancient family of carotenoid-metabolizing enzymes. These enzymes, giving a means by which animals can cleave or modify these plant-derived compounds as required, provide access to retinoids for animals and facilitate their panoply of developmental and physiological effects. We can surmise that the adoption by animals of hormonally and otherwise physiologically active carotenoid metabolites (retinoids) was initially facilitated by such enzymes evolved from an ancient common ancestor. In vertebrates, vitamin A in its various oxidative and isomeric forms is essential for embryonic development (1Morriss-Kay G.M. Ward S.J. Int. Rev.

Retinoic acid, through its interaction with the nuclear retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor, profoundly affects cell differentiation and development. Because animals are unable to synthesize vitamin A de novo from endogenous isoprenoid precursors, they must instead derive it from cleavage of β-carotene and certain other carotenoids with an unsubstituted β-ring (e.g. γ- and α-carotenes, β-zeacarotene, and β-cryptoxanthin). It is generally accepted that central cleavage of β-carotene by a putative dioxygenase gives rise to two molecules of all-trans-retinal, whereas eccentric cleavage with subsequent processing leading to a single molecule of retinoic acid from an apocarotenal is quantitatively far less important (5Nagao A. During A. Hoshino C. Terao J. Olson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). β-Carotene cleavage activity is reported highest in the intestinal mucosa, but is found at high activity levels in liver, kidney, lung, and fat tissues, among other sites. However, an inability to purify the protein catalyzing this reaction has hindered thorough investigation of this crucial first step in vitamin A metabolism. Because of a loose similarity between the mammalian protein RPE65 and the neoxanthin cleavage enzymes of plants, our laboratories have considered the hypothesis that the putative β-CD1 would belong to an emerging family of carotenoid-cleaving dioxygenases known mainly from examples in plants (6Cunningham Jr., F.X. Gannt E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 557-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), but with members also in bacteria and Metazoa. The first described representative was a bacterial lignostilbene α,β-dioxygenase, which cleaves the central carbon–carbon double bond of lignostilbene, a bicyclic lignin model compound, into two molecules of vanillin (7Kamoda S. Saburi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 926-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The initial plant representative of this family is maize VP14, the neoxanthin cleavage enzyme of the abscisic acid pathway (8Tan B.C. Schwartz S.H. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12235-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) that is a 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (9Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The essential similarity of these disparate reactions is shown in Fig. 1. The original animal representative of the family is RPE65, a protein restricted in its expression to the retinal pigment epithelium (10Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15751-15757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,11Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Harris E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the specific biochemical function of RPE65 is not yet known, it is required for the all-trans- to 11-cis-isomerization reaction that regenerates the 11-cis-retinal chromophore of rhodopsin in the visual cycle of the retina (12Redmond T.M., Yu, S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). A thematic feature of the eukaryotic members of the family therefore appears to be an interaction with carotenoids or carotenoid derivatives to cleave or otherwise alter conjugated carbon–carbon double bonds. We used iterative searching of the genomic and EST data bases to find genes encoding polypeptides similar in sequence to RPE65. We describe here the characterization of one such RPE65 homolog from mouse, detail the developmental and tissue specificity of its expression, and define its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. The protein does indeed cleave β-carotene to produce all-trans-retinal, is related, although not closely, to a β-CD recently identified from Drosophila melanogaster(13von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and is of the same family as the recently described chicken β-carotene 15,15′-dioxygenase (14Wyss A. Wirtz G. Woggon W. Brugger R. Wyss M. Friedlein A. Bachmann H. Hunziker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Identification of the mouse β-CD protein and its gene provides the requisite tools for study of early steps of mammalian carotenoid metabolism in an accessible model system and gives additional insights into an ancient family of retinoid/carotenoid-metabolizing enzymes. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have described the catalytic activity and tissue-specific expression pattern of a mouse β-CD. The protein clearly belongs to an extended family of dioxygenases that interact with carotenoids and other polyenes and that include the plant neoxanthin cleavage enzymes, the bacterial lignostilbene dioxygenases, and the vertebrate protein RPE65. The activity of mouse β-CD seen with alternative carotenoid substrates (Fig. 3) indicates that the specificity of the catalytic activity is centered more in the polyene chain of the substrate than at the end groups. This observation is in accord with the activities previously reported for crude tissue preparations (23Lakshmanan M.R. Pope J.L. Olson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 33: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Olson J.A. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1983: 371-412Google Scholar, 25Singh H. Cama H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 370: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, a more accurate and inclusive designation for the family as a whole may be the polyene chain dioxygenase family.The conserved histidines and acidic residues of the various polyene dioxygenase family members are likely to be involved in coordinating the iron required for activity in these enzymes (9Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 26Lakshman M.R. Okoh C. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 214: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The signature sequence, a run of acidic residues connected through a glycine to a hydrophobic tail, could be involved in electron transfer processes during catalysis. Although the precise enzymatic activity of RPE65 has not yet been determined, RPE65 is capable of binding ferrous iron 3S. Gentleman, unpublished data. and thus shares this characteristic as well as the signature sequence with other family members. The resemblance of RPE65 to the other dioxygenase family members and the fact that its absence prevents the retinal pigment epithelium-specific isomerization of all-trans- to 11-cis-retinol in the visual cycle (12Redmond T.M., Yu, S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) suggest a direct catalytic participation in the visual cycle.Although β-CD activity in partially purified preparations from various sources has been localized both to cytosolic and membrane fractions, the overwhelming consensus is that it is a cytosolic protein (23Lakshmanan M.R. Pope J.L. Olson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 33: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Olson J.A. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. 2.

Rev. 1995; 53: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as we also have found. However, an important aspect of the carotenoids and their derivatives as substrates is their lipophilicity (including a tendency to partition in membranes) and generally insoluble nature in aqueous solution. Interestingly, none of the polyene dioxygenase family members, including mouse β-CD, are predicted to be integral membrane proteins. However, the plant 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid cleavage enzymes are associated with chloroplast membranes (9Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The only metazoan member of the family whose biochemical properties have been examined in this respect is RPE65, which is a non-integral, microsomal membrane-associated protein, but can be separated from retinal pigment epithelium membranes by mild detergent or high salt extraction (11Hamel C.P. Tsilou E. Harris E. Pfeffer B.A. Hooks J.J. Detrick B. Redmond T.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RPE65 will specifically associate with phospholipid liposomes (28Tsilou E. Hamel C.P., Yu, S. Redmond T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is possible that mouse β-CD, despite its cytosolic nature, will also interact with membranes in the context of its physiological mechanism.The tissue distribution of mouse β-CD was, in general, as expected, although the level in the small intestine was somewhat weak. However, the β-CD activity of this tissue is concentrated in mature enterocytes (and is highest in the jejunum) (29Duszka C. Grolier P. Azim E.M. Alexandre-Gouabau M.C. Borel P. Azais-Braesco V. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2550-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which constitute a relatively small proportion of the total tissue used to provide the RNA for this blot. Thus, one possibility is that the weak signal in this tissue is due to dilution of the RNA with that from other cell types. Another possibility is that there is a tissue-specific β-CD in small intestine, in addition to the one described here. The testis also is active in the uptake and metabolism of carotenoids, as β-carotene and lycopene have been repeatedly demonstrated in testis (30Yamanushi T. Igarashi O. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. 1995; 41: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 31Kerti A. Bardos L. Acta Vet. Hung. 1999; 47: 95-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Stahl W. Schwarz W. Sundquist A.R. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Cleavage of β-carotene has been shown to be an important source of retinoic acid in vitro in testis as well as in small intestine, liver, kidney, and lung (33Napoli J.L. Race K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17372-17377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the high expression of β-CD in testis noted here is consistent with this finding. Napoli and Race (33Napoli J.L. Race K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17372-17377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that cleavage of β-carotene may be an important source of retinoic acid in target tissues such as testis and may play an under-appreciated role in retinoid homeostasis.Mouse β-CD has a low level of activity toward carotenoids other than β-carotene, including lycopene, observable in in vivoassays. As to its distribution, lycopene is accumulated primarily in liver, but also in intestine, prostate, and testis (34Froescheis O. Moalli S. Liechti H. Bausch J. J. Chromatogr. Biomed. Appl. 2000; 739: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and appears to have several biological activities (35Clinton S.K. Nutr. Rev. 1998; 56: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). For example, in a recent study, lycopene, but not its acycloretinoid derivative, was effective in stimulating gap junction communication (36Stahl W. von Laar J. Martin H.D. Emmerich T. Sies H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this case, the function of the dioxygenase with respect to lycopene might be to terminate its activity.The developmental expression of mouse β-CD is particularly intriguing, given its early elevated expression at embryonic day 7 and much reduced expression thereafter. At embryonic day 7, with the embryo proceeding into gastrulation, a number of retinoids and retinoid-interacting proteins are being expressed (37Ulven S.M. Gundersen T.E. Weedon M.S. Landaas V.O. Sakhi A.K. Fromm S.H. Geronimo B.A. Moskaug J.O. Blomhoff R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Analysis of endogenous retinoids in the mouse embryo (37Ulven S.M. Gundersen T.E. Weedon M.S. Landaas V.O. Sakhi A.K. Fromm S.H. Geronimo B.A. Moskaug J.O. Blomhoff R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) shows that all-trans-retinal is the first retinoid seen (at embryonic day 6.5), whereas both all-trans-retinoic acid and all-trans-retinol do not appear until embryonic day 7.5. In the mouse embryo, mRNAs of two dehydrogenases involved in retinoic acid production, alcohol dehydrogenase IV and aldehyde dehydrogenase I, are up-regulated between embryonic days 6.5 and 7.5 (37Ulven S.M. Gundersen T.E. Weedon M.S. Landaas V.O. Sakhi A.K. Fromm S.H. Geronimo B.A. Moskaug J.O. Blomhoff R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 38Ang H.L. Duester G. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the early accumulation of all-trans-retinal may be due to low level activity of alcohol dehydrogenase IV on maternally supplied all-trans-retinol, there may also be a contribution from the cleavage of β-carotene. Ulven et al. (37Ulven S.M. Gundersen T.E. Weedon M.S. Landaas V.O. Sakhi A.K. Fromm S.H. Geronimo B.A. Moskaug J.O. Blomhoff R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggested this possibility, an interpretation supported by our finding of high β-CD mRNA expression at embryonic day 7. Thus, the activity of β-CD could serve to produce all-trans-retinal from β-carotene, a nontoxic provitamin source of retinoids in the early embryo.The identification of mouse β-CD establishes the existence in mammals of an ancient family of carotenoid-metabolizing enzymes. These enzymes, giving a means by which animals can cleave or modify these plant-derived compounds as required, provide access to retinoids for animals and facilitate their panoply of developmental and physiological effects. We can surmise that the adoption by animals of hormonally and otherwise physiologically active carotenoid metabolites (retinoids) was initially facilitated by such enzymes evolved from an ancient common ancestor. In this report, we have described the catalytic activity and tissue-specific expression pattern of a mouse β-CD. The protein clearly belongs to an extended family of dioxygenases that interact with carotenoids and other polyenes and that include the plant neoxanthin cleavage enzymes, the bacterial lignostilbene dioxygenases, and the vertebrate protein RPE65.

https://openalex.org/W2045121093,"Environmental stressors have been recently shown to activate intracellular mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, such as p38 MAP kinase, leading to changes in cellular functioning. However, little is known about the downstream elements in these signaling cascades. In this study, we show that caveolin-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 in NIH 3T3 cells after stimulation with a variety of cellular stressors (i.e. high osmolarity, H2O2, and UV light). To detect this phosphorylation event, we employed a phosphospecific monoclonal antibody probe that recognizes only tyrosine 14-phosphorylated caveolin-1. Since p38 MAP kinase and c-Src have been previously implicated in the stress response, we next assessed their role in the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Interestingly, we show that the p38 inhibitor (SB203580) and a dominant-negative mutant of c-Src (SRC-RF) both block the stress-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (Tyr(P)14). In contrast, inhibition of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. These results indicate that extracellular stressors can induce caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation through the activation of well established upstream elements, such as p38 MAP kinase and c-Src kinase. However, heat shock did not promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 and did not activate p38 MAP kinase. Finally, we show that after hyperosmotic shock, tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 is localized near focal adhesions, the major sites of tyrosine kinase signaling. In accordance with this localization, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton dramatically potentiates the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Taken together, our results clearly define a novel signaling pathway, involving p38 MAP kinase activation and caveolin-1 (Tyr(P)14). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 may represent an important downstream element in the signal transduction cascades activated by cellular stress. Environmental stressors have been recently shown to activate intracellular mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, such as p38 MAP kinase, leading to changes in cellular functioning.

Since p38 MAP kinase and c-Src have been previously implicated in the stress response, we next assessed their role in the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Interestingly, we show that the p38 inhibitor (SB203580) and a dominant-negative mutant of c-Src (SRC-RF) both block the stress-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (Tyr(P)14). In contrast, inhibition of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. These results indicate that extracellular stressors can induce caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation through the activation of well established upstream elements, such as p38 MAP kinase and c-Src kinase. However, heat shock did not promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 and did not activate p38 MAP kinase. Finally, we show that after hyperosmotic shock, tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 is localized near focal adhesions, the major sites of tyrosine kinase signaling. In accordance with this localization, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton dramatically potentiates the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Taken together, our results clearly define a novel signaling pathway, involving p38 MAP kinase activation and caveolin-1 (Tyr(P)14). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 may represent an important downstream element in the signal transduction cascades activated by cellular stress. mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription monoclonal antibody polyclonal antibody extracellular signal-regulated kinase isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (dioxane-free) phosphate-buffered saline Eukaryotic cells adapt to environmental changes by activating cellular mechanisms that detect and control diverse forms of stress. In many cell types, osmotic stress affects cell volume and intracellular ion homeostasis. Cells shrink when exposed to hyperosmotic stress and swell in hypo-osmotic medium. Usually, cells do not tolerate significant perturbations of cell volume and intracellular ion concentrations. In fact, they manage to restore their normal cell integrity and function. When DNA or protein damage occur, cells activate repair processes and protection systems to compensate for osmotic stress. When osmotic stress is too intense or when cells are exposed to osmotic stress for too long, cells activate programmed cell death cascades (apoptosis) (1Morales M.P. Galvez A. Eltit J.M. Ocaranza P.

MAP kinases have central roles in cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Also, MAP kinases are activated in response to cellular stress. It has been shown that osmotic shock can activate p38, stress-activated protein kinase (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), and Jak/STAT pathways in mammalian cells (6Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.H.

Thus, it has become evident that physico-chemical stressors trigger signal transduction cascades leading to changes in cellular functions.

Caveolin-1 was first identified as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in v-Src-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (18Glenney J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine is not known yet. Using both in vitro and in vivo approaches, we have previously shown that Src induces phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14. Recently, we have characterized a novel monoclonal antibody probe that is specific for tyrosine 14-phosphorylated caveolin-1 (32Lee H. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Iyenegar P. Lublin D.M. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that insulin and epidermal growth factor stimulate phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14. Also, we have shown that activated Src induces constitutive phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14, which is localized in close proximity with focal adhesions (32Lee H. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Iyenegar P. Lublin D.M. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we examine if phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14 is modulated by extracellular stressors. We show that hyperosmotic shock promotes phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14 through the activation of p38 MAP kinase and c-Src kinase. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of caveolin-1 may represent a key element in the signal transduction cascades activated by cellular stress.

NIH 3T3 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of sucrose for the indicated period of time. In recovery experiments, after treatment with 600 mmsucrose for 10 min, cells were grown without sucrose for the indicated period of time. Sucrose was diluted into complete growth medium. NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 600 mm urea alone or in combination with 600 mmsucrose for 10 min. Urea was diluted into complete growth medium. NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 600 mm sorbitol for 10 min. Sorbitol was diluted into complete growth medium. NIH 3T3 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of H2O2 for the indicated period of time. H2O2 was diluted into complete growth medium. NIH 3T3 cells were irradiated with different doses of UV-C light (10, 20, 60, 120, 360, and 600 J/m2). During irradiation, cells were deprived of growth medium. NIH 3T3 cells were incubated at 43 °C for 30 min. NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 5 μg/ml cytochalasin D for 15 min or 1.5 μg/ml nocodazole for 1 h, prior to hyperosmotic shock with 600 mm sucrose for 10 min (in the presence of cytochalasin D or nocodazole) (39Parton R.G.

NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 900 μmcholest-4-en-3-one or 900 μm cholesterol in the presence of 0.2% methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 1 h as described by Liuet al. (40Liu P. Wang P. Michaely P. Zhu M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol.

Also, NIH 3T3 cells were treated with 0.2% methyl-β-cyclodextrin alone for 1 h prior hyperosmotic shock with 600 mmsucrose for 10 min (in the presence methyl-β-cyclodextrin). In all experiments, cells were collected into boiling sample buffer and homogenized using a 26-gauge needle. Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to BA83 nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm; Schleicher & Schuell). Blots were incubated for 2 h in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 2% powdered skim milk and 1% bovine serum albumin. After three washes with TBST, membranes were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (∼1,000-fold diluted in TBST) and for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG (∼5,000-fold diluted). Bound antibodies were detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). NIH 3T3 cells grown on glass coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. Then cells were treated with 25 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature to quench free aldehyde groups. Cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (∼1000-fold diluted in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin). After three washes with PBS (10 min each), cells were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature: lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (5 μg/ml) and/or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (5 μg/ml). Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS (10 min each wash), and slides were mounted with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and observed under a Bio-Rad MR 600 confocal microscope. Note that both anti-phosphocaveolin-1 IgG (mAb cl 56; directed against residues9SEGHLpYTVPI18 (where pY represents phosphotyrosine)) and anti-caveolin-1 IgG (pAb N-20; directed against residues 2SGGKYVDSEGHLYTVPIREQ21) recognize a very similar epitope that is present in Cav-1α (residues 1–178) but lacking in Cav-1β (residues 32–178). NIH 3T3 cells were treated for 16 h with the indicated concentration of p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580 (Calbiochem) or the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway inhibitor, PD98059 (Calbiochem). Cells were then subjected to hyperosmotic shock or H2O2treatment (see “Exposure of NIH 3T3 Cells to Cellular Stress”) in the presence of the inhibitor. To examine if hyperosmotic stress induces the phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14, NIH 3T3 cells were treated with different concentrations of sucrose (1, 10, 50, 100, and 600 mm) for 10 min (Fig. 1, A andB) or with 600 mm sucrose for different periods of time (1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min) (Fig.2, A and B). Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a phosphospecific mAb probe that recognizes only caveolin-1 phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 (mAb cl 56).Figure 2Tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 is maximal after 10 min of hyperosmotic stress. NIH 3T3 cells were left untreated (CTL) or treated with 600 mmsucrose for different periods of time (1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min). Cells were then subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis as described in the legend of Fig. 1. In A, note that treatment with 600 mm sucrose results in maximal tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 at 10 min but then declines to basal levels. InB, note that p38 MAP kinase was also phosphorylated by treatment with 600 mm sucrose for 10 min, but it remained activated for the 30 min of treatment. Each lane contains an equal amount of total protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 1 A shows that caveolin-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 in NIH 3T3 cells treated with 600 mm sucrose for 10 min (upper panel). Phosphorylation of caveolin-1 was undetectable in control cells (CTL). As shown in Fig.2 A, caveolin-1 phosphorylation induced by hyperosmotic stress occurred transiently, since phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14 was maximal after stimulation with 600 mmsucrose for 10 min, and progressively decreased after longer stimulation (upper panel). Interestingly, total caveolin-1 expression did not change upon hyperosmotic stress (Fig.1 A, lower panel, and Fig.2 A, lower panel), indicating that sucrose treatment modulates the phosphorylation state of caveolin-1 rather than caveolin-1 protein expression. Hyperosmotic stress is known to activate the p38 MAP kinase pathway in a variety of different cellular contexts (6Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 7Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 8Bode J.G.

Thus, we verified in our experimental model that hyperosmotic stress activated this intracellular pathway. Fig. 1 B shows that treatment with 600 mm sucrose for 10 min is sufficient to induce the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase (upper panel). Phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase results in the activation of this enzyme. Fig. 2 B shows that, like caveolin-1, phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase in NIH 3T3 cells becomes detectable after stimulation with 600 mm sucrose for 10 min. Interestingly, p38 MAP kinase remained activated if the sucrose stimulation persisted for 30 min (upper panel). Total p38 MAP kinase protein expression was not affected by hyperosmotic stress, as demonstrated using an antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of p38 (Fig. 1 B, lower panel, and Fig. 2 B, lower panel). These findings suggest that the p38 MAP kinase pathway remains activated as long as the cells are subjected to hyperosmotic shock, while the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 represents a transient event. To further explore this idea, we examined if p38 MAP kinase activation and phosphorylation of caveolin-1 could be reversed by removing the hyperosmotic stimulus from the medium of hyperosmotic shocked NIH 3T3 cells. NIH 3T3 cells were shocked with 600 mm sucrose for 10 min and then switched to normal medium (without sucrose) for different periods of time (10 min, 30 min, 2 h, and 4 h) (Fig. 3). Note that phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (Fig. 3 A, upper panel) and p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 3 B, upper panel) are completely reversed when the hyperosmotic stimulus is removed from the growth medium. Importantly, total caveolin-1 (Fig. 3 A,lower panel) and p38 MAP kinase (Fig.3 B, lower panel) protein expression did not change under these experimental conditions. Since hyperosmotic shock induced activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway and phosphorylation of caveolin-1, we next tested the hypothesis that p38 MAP kinase is an up-stream element in the cascade that induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. We pretreated NIH 3T3 cells for 16 h with different concentrations (2, 10, and 50 μm) of a well characterized p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (SB203580) prior to hyperosmotic stimulation for 10 min (in the presence of the inhibitor). Fig. 4 A shows that we successfully inhibited the activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. In fact, treatment with as little as 2 μm SB203580 was sufficient to inhibit p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation (upper right panel). Interestingly, inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase pathway also resulted in the inhibition of caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A,upper left panel). These results support the idea that caveolin-1 phosphorylation follows activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway in the signaling cascade induced by hyperosmotic shock. Total caveolin-1 and p38 MAP kinase protein expression did not change under these experimental conditions (Fig.4 A, lower right and left panels). We next examined if hyperosmotic shock can induce activation of a different MAP kinase pathway, the p42–44 MAP kinase pathway, and if inhibition of the p42–44 MAP kinase pathway results in inhibition of caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. We pretreated NIH 3T3 cells for 16 h with a well known inhibitor of the p42–44 MAP kinase pathway (PD98059; 10 μm) prior to hyperosmotic shock in the presence of inhibitor. Fig. 4 B shows that hyperosmotic shock induces phosphorylation of p42–44 MAP kinase (upper right panel) and caveolin-1 (upper left panel). Interestingly, treatment with the PD98059 inhibitor successfully inhibited phosphorylation of p42–44 MAP kinase (Fig. 4 B, upper right panel) but did not inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (Fig. 4 B, upper left panel). These results suggest that activation of the p42–44 MAP kinase pathway is not necessary for inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1. Total p42–44 MAP kinase and caveolin-1 protein expression did not change under these experimental conditions (Fig. 4 B, lower right andleft panels). We and others have recently demonstrated that caveolin-1 (Tyr14) is a specific tyrosine kinase substrate for activated Src both in vitro and in vivo (32Lee H. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Iyenegar P. Lublin D.M. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined the possible requirement of c-Src kinase activity for the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in response to hyperosmotic shock. For this purpose, we employed an NIH 3T3 cell line stably transfected with an IPTG-inducible vector encoding a dominant-negative mutant of c-Src (termed SRC-RF). SRC-RF is a double mutant that is kinase-dead (K295R) and lacks the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine (Y527F). Induction of SRC-RF expression results in a strong reduction of endogenous c-Src kinase activity (36Rahimi N. Hung W. Tremblay E. Saulnier R. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 37Gao J. Zoller K.E. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J.

Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). SRC-RF expression was induced for 72 h with 5 mm IPTG before the cells were subjected to hyperosmotic shock (in the presence of IPTG). Fig. 5 shows that induction of this dominant negative form of c-Src results in the inhibition of caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to hyperosmotic shock (upper panel). Total caveolin-1 protein expression did not change under these experimental conditions (Fig. 5,lower panel). These data indicate that endogenous c-Src kinase activity is also important for mediating the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in response to cellular stress. These results provide the first evidence that endogenous c-Src is involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 in vivo. To examine the localization of tyrosine 14-phosphorylated caveolin-1 after hyperosmotic shock, we stimulated NIH 3T3 cells with 600 mm sucrose for 10 min and doubly immunostained the cells with anti-phosphocaveolin-1 mouse mAb (clone 56) and anti-caveolin-1 rabbit pAb (N-20). These bound primary antibodies were visualized using distinctly tagged fluorescent secondary antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). Importantly, little or no immunostaining was observed using anti-phosphocaveolin-1 IgG when cells where not subjected to hyperosmotic shock (Fig.6 A, upper left panel). Conversely, caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels increased after cells were treated with 600 mm sucrose for 10 min (Fig. 6 A, lower left panel). Total caveolin-1 protein expression did not change after osmotic shock (Fig. 6 A,central panels). These results are consistent with our results obtained by Western blot analysis (this report), which indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 is induced by hyperosmotic shock. Interestingly, phosphocaveolin-1 is enriched in specific areas of the cell after hyperosmotic shock, which visually resemble focal adhesions. In contrast, total caveolin-1 staining showed only a partial colocalization with phosphocaveolin-1 after osmotic shock (Fig. 6, seecolor overlays, right panels). This partial colocalization may be explained by considering that both anti-phosphocaveolin-1 IgG (mAb 56; directed against residues 9SEGHLpYTVPI18) and anti-caveolin-1 IgG (pAb N-20; directed against residues2SGGKYVDSEGHLYTVPIREQ21) recognize a very similar epitope present in caveolin-1. However, the rabbit anti-caveolin-1 IgG (N-20) reacts with caveolin-1 in a phosphoindependent manner and therefore detects total caveolin-1; in contrast, mouse anti-phosphocaveolin-1 IgG (mAb cl 56) only detects the Tyr14-phosphorylated form of caveolin-1 (32Lee H. Volonté D. Galbiati F. Iyenegar P. Lublin D.M. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these results suggest that only a subpopulation of caveolin-1 is preferentially tyrosine-phosphorylated. To verify that tyrosine 14-phosphorylated caveolin-1 is indeed localized near focal adhesions after hyperosmotic shock, we next performed double labeling experiments with antibodies directed against a widely used marker for focal adhesions, paxillin. After hyperosmotic shock, NIH 3T3 cells were double-labeled with anti-phosphocaveolin-1 mAb (left panel) and anti-paxillin (LRSC-conjugated mAb) (middle panel). Fig.6 B shows that tyrosine 14-phosphorylated caveolin-1 and paxillin colocalize in NIH 3T3 cells, indicating that hyperosmotic shock induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 near focal adhesions. A color overlay is shown to better illustrate this colocalization (right panel). We next examined whether hyperosmolarity by itself or the resulting cell shrinkage is responsible for p38 MAP kinase activation and caveolin-1 phosphorylation. To increase the hypertonicity of the medium, we incubated NIH 3T3 cells with 600 mm urea for 10 min, which is well known not to affect cell volume (9Gatsios P. Terstegen L. Schliess F. Haussinger D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22962-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Fig. 7 shows that sucrose treatment, but not urea treatment, induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (Fig. 7 A, upper panel) and activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 7 B, upper panel). When cells were incubated with 600 mmurea and 600 mm sucrose at the same time, caveolin-1 phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAP kinase were detected. Total caveolin-1 (Fig. 7 A, lower panel) and p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 7 B, lower panel) protein expression did not change under these experimental conditions. In addition, cell shrinkage was morphologically observed after incubation with sucrose but not urea (not shown). From these results, we conclude that cell shrinkage is the trigger for p38 MAP kinase activation and caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. We have shown that cell shrinkage is crucial for caveolin-1 phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 7). Since the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules are important for maintenance of cell shape, we next asked if disruption of these important intracellular elements affects caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. To address this issue, cells were pretreated with either cytochalasin D (to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton) or nocodazole (to disrupt microtubules) prior to osmotic shock with 600 mm sucrose for 10 min. Fig. 8 shows that treatment with cytochalasin D or nocodazole alone did not affect caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. However, pretreatment of cells with these cytoskeletal disruptors dramatically potentiates the effects of osmotic stress induced by treatment with 600 mm sucrose (Fig.8 A). Interestingly, cytochalasin D pretreatment had the largest effect (∼4-fold stimulation). This is consistent with the observation that tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 is localized near focal adhesions, which are known to be linked to the actin cytoskeleton. In contrast, disruption of the cytoskeleton did not potentiate the effect of osmotic stress on p38 activation (Fig.8 B). One possible explanation for these differences is that pretreatment with cytoskeletal disruptors prevents the rapid dephosphorylation of caveolin-1 rather than stimulating its overall phosphorylation. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate a clear link between caveolin-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and the integrity of the cytoskeleton. Also, Fig. 8 shows that both sucrose and sorbitol have similar effects in promoting caveolin-1 phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAP kinase. This result indicates that, independently of the sugar employed, hyperosmotic shock induces caveolin-1 phosphorylation on tyrosine 14 and activation of p38 MAP kinase. Importantly, total caveolin-1 and p38 protein expression did not change under these experimental conditions (Fig. 8, A and B,lower panels)."

To complete the repair after glycosylase action, the AP site is further processed by an incision step, DNA synthesis, an excision step, and DNA ligation. There are two alternative pathways to repair AP-containing DNA as follows: a short patch BER pathway and a long patch BER pathway (19Frosina G. Cappelli E. Fortini P. Dogliotti E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 113: 301-315PubMed Google Scholar, 20Krokan H.E. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 21Matsumoto Y.

The short patch BER pathway has a repair patch of only 1 nucleotide and requires four proteins as follows: AP endonuclease (APE1 also called HAP1 or Ref1), DNA polymerase β (polβ), and DNA ligase III/XRCC1 heterodimer (22Srivastava D.K.

The long patch BER pathways with a repair patch of 2–6 nucleotides can be reconstituted with six proteins as follows: APE1, replication factor C, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), DNA polymerases δ/ε (polδ/ε), and DNA ligase I (21Matsumoto Y.

However, the long patch BER reaction can be stimulated by polβ and trimeric replication protein A (RPA, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein consisting of 11-, 34-, and 70-kDa subunits) (24DeMott M.S. Zigman S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27492-27498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Dianov G.L. Jensen B.R. Kenny M.K. Bohr V.A.

The DNA glycosylase remains bound to the mutagenic AP site until other enzymes in the BER pathway displace it. Protein-protein interactions have been reported among the enzymes involved in BER. APE1 has great affinity for the AP site, cleaving the DNA 5′ to the baseless site, and can displace both thymine- and uracil-DNA glycosylases presumably through interaction with the glycosylases (27Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Kristiansen L. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4953-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). When bound to DNA, DNA polymerase β interacts with APE1 for repair synthesis (30Bennett R.A. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and with the noncatalytic scaffold protein XRCC1 (subunit of the XRCC1-Ligase III heterodimer) (31Marintchev A. Robertson A. Dimitriadis E.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2049-2059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to complete the short patch BER. For the long patch BER, PCNA has been found to interact with a nuclear form of uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG2), DNA polymerases δ and ε, replication factor C, FEN1, and DNA ligase I (32Warbrick E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 33Zhang P. Mo J.Y. Perez A. Leon A. Liu L. Mazloum N. Xu H. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26664.7-26653Google Scholar). In addition, PCNA also interacts with enzymes involved in nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, branch structure processing, cell cycle control, and chromatin assembly (32Warbrick E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 34Tsurimoto T. Front Biosci. 1999; 4: D849-D858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PCNA may act as a molecular adaptor, coordinating and regulating the actions of DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle control (35Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 236-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). UDG2 has been demonstrated to colocalize to the replication foci through interactions with PCNA and RPA, where BER is initiated to repair misincorporated uracils (36Otterlei M. Warbrick E. Nagelhus T.A. Haug T. Slupphaug G. Akbari M. Aas P.A. Steinsbekk K. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3834-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). RPA is also involved in the latter stages of long patch BER by stimulation of FEN1 activity, although it is not required in the reconstituted reactions (37Biswas E.E. Zhu F.X. Biswas S.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5955-5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Additional functions of RPA include recombination repair, the initiation of DNA replication, and interaction with XPA during the initial steps of nucleotide excision repair (reviewed in Ref. 38Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). DNA ligase I has been shown to interact with polβ and PCNA to complete the long patch BER (39Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N.

It has been shown that the type of DNA glycosylase that recognizes the lesion can determine the appropriate patch-size repair pathway (42Dianov G.L. Thybo T. Dianova I.I. Lipinski L.J. Bohr V.A. J.

Little is known regarding the repair patch size and protein-protein interactions involved in the hMYH repair pathway. In this paper, we demonstrate that hMYH binds to APE1, PCNA, and RPA, through the use of coimmunoprecipitation as well as affinity binding to glutathione S-transferase hMYH (GST-hMYH) fusion protein constructs and hMYH peptides. This suggests that hMYH catalyzes base excision repair via a PCNA-dependent long patch pathway. The hMYH gene was cloned from a HeLa cDNA library (Invitrogen), using the primers 5′-GCTATCATTAATATGACACCGCTCGTCTCCCGC-3′ (CHANG 262) and 5′-GCTAACCT AGGTCACTGGGCTGCACTGTTGAG-3′ (CHANG 227). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with AsnI andBamHI and ligated into theNdeI-BamHI-digested pET11a vector (Novagen). The sequence of the cloned hMYH cDNA was confirmed to be the same sequence as published (5Slupska M.M. Baikalov C. Luther W.M. Chiang J.-H. Wei Y.-F. Miller J.H. J.

The cell paste, from a 500-ml culture, was resuspended in 9 ml of buffer G (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) and treated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. After adding 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2 mmdithiothreitol, the solution was then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. To the supernatant (10 ml), 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B in buffer G was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C.

The DNA cleavage activity (DNA glycosylase activity followed by heating) of hMYH was assayed similarly as E. coli MutY glycosylase as described (46Parker A. Gu Y. Lu A.L.

The DNA substrate is a 20-mer duplex DNA containing an A/8-oxoG mismatch (5′-CCGAGGAATTAGCCCCCTTCTGC-3′/3′-GGCTCCTTAAOCGGGGGAAGACG5′, where O represents 8-oxoG) that is labeled at the 3′-end of the mismatched A-containing strand. Human MYH was immunoprecipitated from HeLa nuclear extracts as mentioned above and washed with buffer G. The pellet was then washed five times with 800 μl of glycosylase reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 15% (v/v) glycerol and resuspended in 40 μl of the same buffer. To the reaction mixture was added 1.8 fmol of 3′-end-labeled 20-mer duplex containing the A/8-oxoG DNA mismatch. After 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g, and the supernatant was extracted with phenol and precipitated by ethanol. The pellets were dissolved in 3 μl of loading dye containing 90% (v/v) formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The DNA samples were heated at 90 °C for 2 min and analyzed on 14% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gels (52Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). The gel was then autoradiographed. Purified recombinant APE1 (100 ng) expressed in E. coli, PCNA (100 ng) expressed in E. coli, or trimeric RPA (100 ng) expressed in the baculovirus expression system in insect Sf9 cells (45Stigger E. Dean F.B. Hurwitz J. Lee S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were added to the appropriate GST-hMYH constructs (Table I) (300 ng), immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (see above), and incubated overnight in 50 μl of buffer G containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C. For RPA, the Nonidet P-40 was omitted from all steps. After centrifugation at 1000 × g, the supernatant was saved, and the pellets were washed five times with 800 μl of buffer G containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C. The pellets and supernatants (20 μl) were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot analyses for APE1, PCNA, and RPA34 were performed as described (49Towbin H.T. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). A control was run concurrently with immobilized GST alone. For coprecipitation of APE1, PCNA, or RPA with GST-hMYH from HeLa nuclear extracts, 200–300 ng of GST-hMYH or GST alone was added to HeLa nuclear extract (1.0 mg) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 1000 × g, the supernatant (∼2% of total volume) and the pellet was treated as described above. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads immobilized with GST-hMYH were complexed with APE1, PCNA, and trimeric RPA as described above except that after washing five times with 800 μl of buffer G, the complexes were washed five times with 800 μl of DNase I reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, and 50 μg/ml BSA) and resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer. To the reaction mixture, 4.5 units of DNase I (Sigma) were added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 1000 × g, the supernatant was saved, and the pellets were washed five times with 800 μl of DNase I reaction buffer at 4 °C. The samples were analyzed as mentioned above.

The peptidesCRKKPRMGQQVLDNFFRSHISTDA (p505),CRKKPRMGQQVLDNAARSHISTDA (p505FF→AA), andCSRLSRLWAIMRKPRAAVGSGHRKQAAS (p6) were synthesized (University of Maryland Bioploymer Laboratory) and immobilized on activated CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by methods described previously (53Fuller S.A. Takahashi M. Hurrell J.G.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

The method employed for the peptide pull-down assay was similar to the GST-hMYH pull-down assay, except APE1, PCNA, or RPA (100 ng), and the appropriate Sepharose-immobilized peptide (50 μl) were incubated overnight in 50 μl of buffer G containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C. For RPA the Nonidet P-40 was omitted from all steps. A control with Sepharose-immobilized BSA was run concurrently. To investigate the hMYH-interacting proteins in vivo, an antibody against an hMYH peptide (α516) was used to immunoprecipitate proteins from HeLa nuclear extracts that were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting to identify the interacting proteins. Antibodies against several BER proteins were utilized in these experiments. We were able to detect APE1, PCNA, and RPA but not polβ and polδ in the immunoprecipitants (Fig. 1 A, panels 1–5). In the reciprocal experiments, hMYH was detected in the immunoprecipitants using anti-APE1, anti-PCNA, and anti-RPA70 as the first antibodies (Fig. 1 A, panels 6–8). Human MYH was not detected in the immunoprecipitants using anti-polβ and anti-polδ (Fig. 1 A, panels 9 and10). These results suggest a physical interaction exists between hMYH and APE1, PCNA, and RPA (but not polβ and polδ)in vivo. Controls without the primary antibody were run concurrently, and hMYH, APE1, PCNA, and RPA were not detected in these immunoprecipitants (data not shown). In addition, actin was not detected in the immunoprecipitants using anti-hMYH antibodies (data not shown). Because hMYH, APE1, PCNA, and RPA were detected in both the supernatants and the immunoprecipitants (Fig. 1 A, comparelanes 2 and 3 in panels 1–3 and6–8), some of the nuclear hMYH, APE1, PCNA, or RPA may remain free or may be associated with other unrelated proteins. To demonstrate further an interaction between hMYH and APE1, PCNA, and RPA, GST-hMYH immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was added to HeLa nuclear extracts (Fig. 1 B) to pull down the interacting proteins. The 535-residue hMYH was fused to GST and expressed inE. coli. This form (type 1) of hMYH has been shown to be transported into the mitochondria by Takao et al. (7Takao M. Zhang Q.M. Yonei S. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3638-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 54Takao M. Aburatani H. Kobayashi K. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2917-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) but has been shown to localized to the nuclei by Tsai-Wu et al. (55Tsai-Wu J.-J. Su H.-T. Wu Y.-L. Hsu S.-M. Wu C.H.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ability of APE1, PCNA, and RPA to bind hMYH was demonstrated by detection of these three proteins in the GST-hMYH beads (Fig. 1 B, panels 1–3, lane 3). None of the proteins bound to immobilized GST alone (Fig. 1 B,panels 1–3, lane 5). Actin, in the extracts, was not bound to GST-hMYH beads (data not shown). To determine whether the hMYH present in the immunoprecipitants is active, we assayed the adenine DNA glycosylase activity toward A/8-oxoG-containing DNA. Fig. 1 C shows that the immunoprecipitants with both hMYH peptide antibodies (α344 and α516) possesses adenine glycosylase activity (lanes 2 and3). Furthermore, the immunoprecipitants with antibodies against APE1, PCNA, and RPA70 all had adenine glycosylase activity (Fig. 1 C, lanes 4–6). Thus, this suggests that active hMYH is present in complexes with APE1, PCNA, and RPA proteins in the HeLa nuclear extracts. Since APE1, PCNA, and RPA interact with many different proteins (TablesTable II, Table III, Table IV and Refs. 20Krokan H.E. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Otterlei M. Slupphaug G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar and 21Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Hurwitz J. Gary R. Levine D.S. Tomkinson A.E. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33703-33708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), it is possible that an indirect association between hMYH and these three proteins may occur via intermediate proteins. To demonstrate that a direct interaction exists between hMYH and APE1, PCNA, and RPA, we performed affinity binding experiments with full-length GST-hMYH (residues 1–535) and individual homogeneously purified APE1, PCNA, and RPA. All three proteins were detected in the GST-hMYH pellets (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and2, panels 1–3) but not in the GST beads (Fig.2 A, lanes 5 and 6, panels 1–3). It is worth noting that the binding reaction between hMYH and APE1 is more complete than that between hMYH and PCNA or RPA. Thus, there are direct associations between hMYH-APE1, hMYH-PCNA, and hMYH-RPA.Table IIPCNA-binding motifsThe 8-residue PCNA-binding motif is numbered 1–8 at the top.

Here, we demonstrated that HeLa cells were susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis under the condition of glutamine deprivation. Fas ligation activated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)) in Gln-deprived cells but not in normal cells, suggesting that Gln might be involved in the activity control of ASK1 and JNK/SAPK. As one of the possible mechanisms for the suppressive effect of Gln on ASK1, we investigated the molecular interaction between human glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (QRS) and ASK1 and found the Gln-dependent association of the two molecules. While their association was enhanced by the elevation of Gln concentration, they were dissociated by Fas ligation within 5 min. The association involved the catalytic domains of the two enzymes. The ASK1 activity was inhibited by the interaction with QRS as determined by in vitro kinase and transcription assays. Finally, we have shown that QRS inhibited the cell death induced by ASK1, and this antiapoptotic function of QRS was weakened by the deprivation of Gln. Thus, the antiapoptotic interaction of QRS with ASK1 is controlled positively by the cellular concentration of Gln and negatively by Fas ligation.

For example, Gln supplementation reduces apoptosis induced by heat shock, irradiation, and c-Myc overexpression (10Chow A. Zhang R. J.

Furthermore, Gln stimulates intestinal cell proliferation and activates mitogen-activated protein kinases such as p42/p44 MAPK and JNK/SAPK (13Rhoads J.M. Argenzio R.A. Chen W. Rippe R.A.

However, the molecular mechanism of Gln in suppressing apoptosis and stimulating cellular proliferation remains to be explained.Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze aminoacylation of their cognate tRNAs and thus play an essential role in protein synthesis. ARSs have been found in cytoskeleton- or endoplasmic reticulum-associated structures or in cytoplasm, but they are also found in the nucleus and even in the nucleolus (15Dang C.V. Yang D.C. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1138-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Schimmel P. Wang C.C. Trends. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that ARSs have various noncanonical functions in addition to tRNA aminoacylation from eukaryotes. In particular, methionyl-tRNA synthetase is involved in rRNA biogenesis at its localization site in the nucleolus (17Ko Y.-G. Kang Y.-S. Kim E.-K. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Upon cellular exposure to apoptosis condition, mammalian tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is secreted and split into two fragments with distinct cytokine activities by leukocyte elastase and extracellular protease (18Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 19Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23155-23159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The split cytokines contain an endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II-like domain and an interleukin-8-like domain. Thus, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase has a potent apoptosis-inducing activity after proteolytic cleavage, since their split polypepetides stimulate the production of TNF and tissue factor from target cells and have leukocyte chemotaxis activity to scavenge apoptotic corpses. The precursor of endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II is associated with the N-terminal noncatalytic extension of arginyl-tRNA synthetase and enhances aminoacylation activity (20Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Like human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, the cytokine domain of this precursor is released upon apoptosis and exerts its proapoptotic function (21Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A. Deutsch U.

We first searched for the effect of Gln in suppressing Fas-mediated apoptosis and reducing the activation of ASK1 as well as JNK/SAPK. We also observed that QRS inhibits ASK1 kinase activity and apoptosis by binding to ASK1. The molecular interaction of QRS and ASK1 was dependent on glutamine concentration, suggesting that glutamine could repress Fas-mediated apoptosis and ASK1 activation via QRS.DISCUSSIONAminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are a family of enzymes essential for protein synthesis. However, it has been discovered that these enzymes are actively involved in a broad repertoire of other critical cellular activities as well as protein synthesis (36Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been previously demonstrated that ARSs have idiosyncratic distribution in cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus (17Ko Y.-G. Kang Y.-S. Kim E.-K. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Popenko V.I. Ivanova J.L. Cherny N.E. Filonenko V.V. Beresten S.F. Wolfson A.D. Kisselev L.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 60-69PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, methionyl-tRNA synthetase is localized in the nucleolus of rapidly proliferating mammalian cells and is responsible for ribosomal RNA biosynthesis (17Ko Y.-G. Kang Y.-S. Kim E.-K. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Seshaiah and Andrew (38Seshaiah P. Andrew D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) also showed that each ARS is uniquely expressed in different tissues and developmental stages ofDrosophila. Thus, the differential expression and cellular localization of each ARS imply that each ARS has its noncanonical function in addition to the catalytic activity for tRNA aminoacylation. Indeed, different ARSs play roles in tRNA maturation (proofreading and nuclear export), cytokine-like activity, mitochondrial RNA splicing, and transcriptional and translational regulation (36Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Here, we found that human QRS is not only the enzyme for cell proliferation but also the protein that plays a regulatory role in cell death through an antagonistic interaction with ASK1, a protein kinase that plays a critical role in apoptosis. QRS has been classified as a component of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (39Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Yang D.C.H. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, QRS not associated with the multi-tRNA synthetase complex has been found (41Pahuski E. Klekamp M. Condon T. Hampel A.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 114: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and shown to be catalytically active (26Kim T. Park S.G. Kim J.E. Seol W. Ko Y.-G. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21768-21772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, QRS bound to ASK1 may be in dynamic equilibrium with that in the multi-tRNA synthetase complex.Extensive investigations have revealed important effects of exogenous Gln in nutritional rehabilitation, stimulating intestinal villus regrowth after damage from chemotherapy and improving intestinal barrier function. In addition, Gln blocks apoptosis induced by heat shock, irradiation, and c-Myc-overexpression. In Figs. 1 and 2, we show that Gln prevents the activation of stress kinases such as ASK1 and JNK/ASK1 and then apoptosis initiated by Fas ligation, suggesting that Gln is an apoptosis suppressor. The cellular susceptibility to Fas-mediated signaling by Gln deprivation could not be explained by the protein synthesis inhibition, because ASK1 and JNK/SAPK were activated within 10 min after Fas ligation in Gln-free cells but not in normal cells. Therefore, Gln could suppress apoptosis by inhibiting ASK1 and then JNK/SAPK.Although the similar amount of exogenous QRS was expressed in cells grown in complete and Gln-free medium, the molecular interaction between QRS and ASK1 was fortified and then the ASK1 activity was strongly inhibited in the presence of Gln (Fig. 6), indicating the positive effect of Gln on the interaction of the two molecules. It has been already demonstrated that amino acids themselves can be signaling molecules. For instance, glutamate acts as a messenger in glucose-induced insulin exocytosis because exogenous glutamate directly stimulates insulin exocytosis, independently of mitochondrial function in permeabilized cells (44Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Here, we suggest that Gln could be a signaling messenger for blocking ASK1 activation and suppressing apoptosis via binding to QRS.Some types of apoptosis are suppressed by the activation of AKT/protein kinase B and MAPK. Activation of AKT/protein kinase B by extracellular survival factors prevents apoptosis by inactivating caspase-9, BAD, Forkhead, and IKKα that are involved in the apoptosis pathway (45Khwaja A.

Although further investigations are necessary to better understand the mechanism and control for the role of QRS in apoptosis, the results of this work provide the first evidence that one of the mammalian ARSs has a direct antagonistic interaction with a kinase that plays a key role in apoptosis. Apoptosis is a genetically regulated process that is essential for correct morphogenesis during embryogenesis and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis (1Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

Apoptosis is induced by cytokines such as Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor (TNF),1 growth factor withdrawal, ischemia, and amino acid deprivation (5Lee J.M. Zipfel G.J. Choi D.W. Nature. 1999; 399: A7-A14Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 7Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar, 8Papaconstantinou H.T.

Glutamine is a nonessential amino acid, but it is heavily utilized as a major metabolic fuel as well as a precursor for nucleotide synthesis in fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and macrophages (9Neu J. Shenoy V. Chakrabarti R. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Since Gln deprivation induces apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells, whereas methionine deprivation does not (8Papaconstantinou H.T. Hwang K.O. Rajaraman S. Hellmich M.R. Townsend Jr., C.M.

Surgery. 1998; 124: 152-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), Gln might play an important role in protecting cells from apoptosis induced by different stimuli. For example, Gln supplementation reduces apoptosis induced by heat shock, irradiation, and c-Myc overexpression (10Chow A. Zhang R. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Santoso J.T. Lucci III, J.A. Coleman R.L. Hatch S. Wong P. Miller D. Mathis J.M. Gynecol.

Furthermore, Gln stimulates intestinal cell proliferation and activates mitogen-activated protein kinases such as p42/p44 MAPK and JNK/SAPK (13Rhoads J.M. Argenzio R.A. Chen W. Rippe R.A.

However, the molecular mechanism of Gln in suppressing apoptosis and stimulating cellular proliferation remains to be explained. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze aminoacylation of their cognate tRNAs and thus play an essential role in protein synthesis. ARSs have been found in cytoskeleton- or endoplasmic reticulum-associated structures or in cytoplasm, but they are also found in the nucleus and even in the nucleolus (15Dang C.V. Yang D.C. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1138-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Schimmel P. Wang C.C. Trends. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that ARSs have various noncanonical functions in addition to tRNA aminoacylation from eukaryotes. In particular, methionyl-tRNA synthetase is involved in rRNA biogenesis at its localization site in the nucleolus (17Ko Y.-G. Kang Y.-S. Kim E.-K. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Upon cellular exposure to apoptosis condition, mammalian tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is secreted and split into two fragments with distinct cytokine activities by leukocyte elastase and extracellular protease (18Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 19Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23155-23159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The split cytokines contain an endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II-like domain and an interleukin-8-like domain. Thus, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase has a potent apoptosis-inducing activity after proteolytic cleavage, since their split polypepetides stimulate the production of TNF and tissue factor from target cells and have leukocyte chemotaxis activity to scavenge apoptotic corpses. The precursor of endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II is associated with the N-terminal noncatalytic extension of arginyl-tRNA synthetase and enhances aminoacylation activity (20Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Like human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, the cytokine domain of this precursor is released upon apoptosis and exerts its proapoptotic function (21Knies U.E. Behrensdorf H.A. Mitchell C.A. Deutsch U.

Here, we studied a novel regulatory role of human glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (QRS) in inhibiting apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). We first searched for the effect of Gln in suppressing Fas-mediated apoptosis and reducing the activation of ASK1 as well as JNK/SAPK. We also observed that QRS inhibits ASK1 kinase activity and apoptosis by binding to ASK1. The molecular interaction of QRS and ASK1 was dependent on glutamine concentration, suggesting that glutamine could repress Fas-mediated apoptosis and ASK1 activation via QRS. DISCUSSIONAminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are a family of enzymes essential for protein synthesis. However, it has been discovered that these enzymes are actively involved in a broad repertoire of other critical cellular activities as well as protein synthesis (36Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has been previously demonstrated that ARSs have idiosyncratic distribution in cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus (17Ko Y.-G. Kang Y.-S. Kim E.-K. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Popenko V.I. Ivanova J.L. Cherny N.E. Filonenko V.V. Beresten S.F. Wolfson A.D. Kisselev L.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 60-69PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, methionyl-tRNA synthetase is localized in the nucleolus of rapidly proliferating mammalian cells and is responsible for ribosomal RNA biosynthesis (17Ko Y.-G. Kang Y.-S. Kim E.-K. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Seshaiah and Andrew (38Seshaiah P. Andrew D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) also showed that each ARS is uniquely expressed in different tissues and developmental stages ofDrosophila. Thus, the differential expression and cellular localization of each ARS imply that each ARS has its noncanonical function in addition to the catalytic activity for tRNA aminoacylation. Indeed, different ARSs play roles in tRNA maturation (proofreading and nuclear export), cytokine-like activity, mitochondrial RNA splicing, and transcriptional and translational regulation (36Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Here, we found that human QRS is not only the enzyme for cell proliferation but also the protein that plays a regulatory role in cell death through an antagonistic interaction with ASK1, a protein kinase that plays a critical role in apoptosis. QRS has been classified as a component of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (39Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Yang D.C.H. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, QRS not associated with the multi-tRNA synthetase complex has been found (41Pahuski E. Klekamp M. Condon T. Hampel A.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1983; 114: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and shown to be catalytically active (26Kim T. Park S.G. Kim J.E. Seol W. Ko Y.-G. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21768-21772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, QRS bound to ASK1 may be in dynamic equilibrium with that in the multi-tRNA synthetase complex.Extensive investigations have revealed important effects of exogenous Gln in nutritional rehabilitation, stimulating intestinal villus regrowth after damage from chemotherapy and improving intestinal barrier function. In addition, Gln blocks apoptosis induced by heat shock, irradiation, and c-Myc-overexpression. In Figs. 1 and 2, we show that Gln prevents the activation of stress kinases such as ASK1 and JNK/ASK1 and then apoptosis initiated by Fas ligation, suggesting that Gln is an apoptosis suppressor. The cellular susceptibility to Fas-mediated signaling by Gln deprivation could not be explained by the protein synthesis inhibition, because ASK1 and JNK/SAPK were activated within 10 min after Fas ligation in Gln-free cells but not in normal cells. Therefore, Gln could suppress apoptosis by inhibiting ASK1 and then JNK/SAPK.Although the similar amount of exogenous QRS was expressed in cells grown in complete and Gln-free medium, the molecular interaction between QRS and ASK1 was fortified and then the ASK1 activity was strongly inhibited in the presence of Gln (Fig. 6), indicating the positive effect of Gln on the interaction of the two molecules. It has been already demonstrated that amino acids themselves can be signaling molecules. For instance, glutamate acts as a messenger in glucose-induced insulin exocytosis because exogenous glutamate directly stimulates insulin exocytosis, independently of mitochondrial function in permeabilized cells (44Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2008560589,"Abstract Frequenin, a member of a large family of myristoyl-switch calcium-binding proteins, functions as a calcium-ion sensor to modulate synaptic activity and secretion. We show that human frequenin colocalizes with ARF1 GTPase in COS-7 cells and occurs in similar cellular compartments as the phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase PI4Kβ, the mammalian homolog of the yeast kinase PIK1. In addition, the crystal structure of unmyristoylated, calcium-bound human frequenin has been determined and refined to 1.9 A resolution. The overall fold of frequenin resembles those of neurocalcin and the photoreceptor, recoverin, of the same family, with two pairs of calcium-binding EF hands and three bound calcium ions. Despite the similarities, however, frequenin displays significant structural differences. A large conformational shift of the C-terminal region creates a wide hydrophobic crevice at the surface of frequenin. This crevice, which is unique to frequenin and distinct from the myristoyl-binding box of recoverin, may accommodate a yet unknown protein ligand."

Accordingly, the G2 arrest induced by DNA damage is associated with a down-regulation of mitotic cyclins, cdk1, and cdc25C phosphatase expression. We found that the promoter activity of these genes is repressed in the G2 arrest induced by DNA damage. We asked whether the CCAAT-binding NF-Y modulates mitoticcyclins, cdk1, and cdc25C gene transcription during this type of G2 arrest. In our experimental conditions, the integrity of the CCAAT boxes ofcyclin B1, cyclin B2, and cdc25Cpromoters, as well as the presence of a functional NF-Y complex, is strictly required for the transcriptional inhibition of these promoters. Furthermore, a dominant-negative p53 protein, impairing doxorubicin-induced G2 arrest, prevents transcriptional down-regulation of the mitotic cyclins, cdk1, and cdc25C genes. We conclude that, as already demonstrated for cdk1, NF-Y mediates the transcriptional inhibition of the mitotic cyclins and the cdc25C genes during p53-dependent G2 arrest induced by DNA damage.

The kinase activity of cdk1 during the G2 phase is dependent on its dephosphorylated status of specific residues triggered by the phosphatase activity of cdc25C protein (1Gould K.L. Nurse P.

This checkpoint ensures correct DNA synthesis during cell proliferation and genome integrity after DNA damage. In the latter condition, cells can arrest at the G1and/or the G2 checkpoint, depending on cell type, cell cycle phase, and checkpoint integrity (15Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B.

The G1/G2 arrest after DNA damage is regulated, at least in part, by the activities of the tumor suppressor genep53. Indeed, γ-irradiated cells, knockout for thep53 gene, progress from the G2 to the M phase and maintain DNA content of 4n because of cytokinesis failure (18Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T.

Overexpression of an exogenous wild type p53 induces G2arrest associated with down-regulation of cyclin B1, cyclin A, and cdk1 expression (19Innocente S.A. Abrahamson J.L. Cogswell J.P. Lee J.M.

In agreement with these observations, it has been reported that wild type p53 overexpression in p53-null cells can suppress the transcriptional activity of cyclin A,cyclin B1, and cdk1 promoters (19Innocente S.A.

However, the specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the down-regulation of the transcription of these genes in the G2 arrest are still unknown.The CCAAT motif, G/AG/ACCAATC/GA/GC/G, is present in 30% of the eukaryotic promoters of tissue-specific, housekeeping, and cell cycle-regulatory classes of genes (25Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). NF-Y1 has been shown to bind to more than 120 CCAAT-containing promoters (26Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It is composed of three subunits, NF-YA, -B, and -C, whose highly conserved genes have been cloned in mammals, yeast, plants, and parasites (27Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 119-127Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 28Li X.Y. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D.J. Biol.

Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 93: 119-125Crossref Google Scholar). All three subunits are required for CCAAT binding (32Caretti G. Motta M.C. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2818-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The promoters of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin B2,cdk1, and cdc25C genes all contain CCAAT boxes, and it has been demonstrated that NF-Y modulates, at least in part, their activity during the cell cycle (11Zwicker J. Gross C. Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Ehlert F Engeland K. Muller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Farina A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Tiainen M.

Muller H. Manni I. Mossner J. Piaggio G. Mantovani R. Engeland K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether NF-Y is involved in the modulation of these promoter activities during the G2 arrest induced by DNA damage.For this purpose, we induced a G2 arrest by doxorubicin (Adriamycin; ADR)-mediated DNA damage in C2C12 nontransformed skeletal muscle cells, which possess a wild type p53 (35Soddu S. Blandino G. Scardigli R. Coen S. Marchetti A. Rizzo M.G. Bossi G. Imino L. Crescenzi M. Sacchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We found that ADR treatment down-regulates the promoter activities of the mitoticcyclins, cdk1, and cdc25C genes. This down-regulation involves a molecular mechanism requiring, at least in part, the CCAAT boxes and the transcription factor NF-Y. By using a dominant-negative p53 protein (DD-p53), we also show that the NF-Y-dependent down-regulation of mitoticcyclins, cdk1, and cdc25C occurs only in the presence of a functional p53 protein.DISCUSSIONThe progression through the G2 phase of the cell cycle is regulated in part by the cyclin A-cdk1 and cyclin B-cdk1 mitotic complexes (49Pines J. Hunter T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar, 50Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Although it has been described that after DNA damage the mitotic entry is inhibited (18Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedlvy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar, 43Flatt P.M. Tang L.J. Scatena C.D. Szak S.T. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 87-96Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism sustaining the G2 arrest is not completely elucidated. In this report, we show that during the ADR-mediated G2 arrest, a decrease of protein expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cdk1, and cdc25C caused, at least in part, by a transcriptional level of regulation, is observed. Indeed, we demonstrate that after ADR treatment the promoter activities of thecyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin B2,cdk1, and cdc25C genes are down-regulated. These results indicate that key molecules that control G2/M transition in the normal cell cycle are transcriptionally modulated during the G2 checkpoint induced by DNA damage.The repression of cyclin B1, cyclin B2, andcdc25C promoters, occurring in the G2 arrest, requires the integrity of the CCAAT boxes present in the 5′ region of these genes, suggesting a role for the transcription factor NF-Y (Figs.3 and 4). It has been demonstrated previously that NF-Y binds the CCAAT boxes of cyclin B1, cyclin B2, andcdc25C promoters (11Zwicker J. Gross C. Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Ehlert F Engeland K. Muller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Farina A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Tiainen M. Cenciarelli C. Bellorini M. Mantovani R. Sacchi A. Piaggio G.

Engeland K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here we show that a functional NF-Y complex is required for the inhibition of cyclin B1, cyclin B2, and cdc25C promoters during G2 arrest. Indeed, the expression of a dominant-negative NF-YA abolishes the ADR-mediated repression of these promoters. Moreover, as already demonstrated, this is true also for thecdk1 promoter (24Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The down-regulation of expression and transcription of mitotic cyclin-cdk1 complexes, as well as of cdc25C phosphatase, after DNA damage requires the presence of a functional p53 protein (Fig. 8). In agreement with this result it has been reported that overexpression of p53 in p53-null cells suppresses the transcriptional activity of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin B2, and cdk1 promoters (19Innocente S.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4410-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this is the first evidence that the cdc25C promoter activity is down-regulated also.None of the tested promoters contains a canonical DNA binding site for p53, thus our results lead to the speculation that p53 could interfere with the function of NF-Y. Indeed, it has been described that p53 protein can repress transcription by binding to and preventing the function of specific transcription factors (53Farmer G. Friedlander P. Colgan J. Manley J.L. Prives C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4281-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 54Gopalkrishnan R.V. Lam E.W.F. Kedinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10972-10978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In shift experiments performed with anti NF-Y we observed that NF-Y is present on the CCAAT boxes of cyclin B1 and cyclin B2promoters before and after ADR-treatment. 2I. Manni, unpublished observations Thus, p53 does not interfere with the DNA binding of NF-Y. Another possibility is that p53 interferes with the NF-Y recruitment of coactivators and/or general transcription factors. Indeed, it has been shown that p53 and NF-Y bind to overlapping domains of the p300 coactivator (55Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Levine A.S. Kelly K.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and both p53 and NF-Y bind to TATA-binding protein (57Farmer G. Colgan J. Nakatani Y. Manley J.L. Prives C. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2174-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Interestingly, NF-Y was shown also by other groups to be required for the p53-mediated inhibition of cdk1 transcription (23Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.L. Schonthal A.H. Katula K.S. Stark G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NF-Y binds the CCAAT box contained in the cyclin A promoter (11Zwicker J. Gross C. Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Ehlert F Engeland K. Muller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings lead to the speculation that NF-Y modulates cdk1 and cyclin A transcription after ADR-mediated G2 arrest by the same mechanism described here for the cyclin B1, cyclin B2, andcdc25C genes.It has been shown recently that an endogenous p53 protein sustains a G2 arrest induced by ADR through a pRb-dependent decrease of cyclin B1 and cdk1 expression (43Flatt P.M. Tang L.J. Scatena C.D. Szak S.T. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4210-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the pRb-dependent inhibition of cyclin B1 expression does not seem to be caused by direct binding of pRB/E2F family proteins to the cyclin B1 promoter. Indeed, as assessed by chromatin cross-linked immunoprecipitation, an anti-E2F1 antibody does not immunoprecipitate, from cycling cells, chromatin containing the cyclin B1 promoter, whereas an anti-NF-Y antibody does. 3S. Sciortino, unpublished observations. The transcriptional regulation of the expression of mitotic kinase complexes is not the only mechanism that sustains a G2block. Indeed, it has been demonstrated recently that in a human colorectal cancer cell line, the p53-dependent G2 arrest after γ-irradiation is the result of induction of 14–3-3ς expression (59Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Once overexpressed, 14–3-3ς blocks the cell cycle contributing to the nuclear exclusion of cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes and cdc25C phosphatase (60Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Thus, after DNA damage, transcriptional down-regulation of mitotic kinase complexes (this paper) and their cytoplasmic segregation (56Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) might concomitantly sustain the G2 checkpoint.In summary, this work provides evidences that in muscle cells, the molecular mechanism responsible for the G2 checkpoint induced by ADR-mediated DNA damage involves the ability of the NF-Y transcription factor to prevent the transcription of key regulatory molecules essential for the progression through the G2phase of the cell cycle. This finding opens the question of whether other genes, controlled by NF-Y during the cell cycle (26Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), are targets of its activity in the cell cycle checkpoints. In mammalian cells, progression through the G2 phase of the cell cycle is mediated by the activity of a specific set of proteins, which includes mitotic cyclins A, B1, and B2, mitotic kinase cdk1 (alias p34cdc2), and mitotic phosphatase cdc25C. The kinase activity of cdk1 during the G2 phase is dependent on its dephosphorylated status of specific residues triggered by the phosphatase activity of cdc25C protein (1Gould K.L. Nurse P.

Cell cycle progression through the G2 phase is controlled by the G2 checkpoint. This checkpoint ensures correct DNA synthesis during cell proliferation and genome integrity after DNA damage. In the latter condition, cells can arrest at the G1and/or the G2 checkpoint, depending on cell type, cell cycle phase, and checkpoint integrity (15Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B.

Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedlvy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Overexpression of an exogenous wild type p53 induces G2arrest associated with down-regulation of cyclin B1, cyclin A, and cdk1 expression (19Innocente S.A. Abrahamson J.L. Cogswell J.P. Lee J.M.

In agreement with these observations, it has been reported that wild type p53 overexpression in p53-null cells can suppress the transcriptional activity of cyclin A,cyclin B1, and cdk1 promoters (19Innocente S.A.

However, the specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the down-regulation of the transcription of these genes in the G2 arrest are still unknown. The CCAAT motif, G/AG/ACCAATC/GA/GC/G, is present in 30% of the eukaryotic promoters of tissue-specific, housekeeping, and cell cycle-regulatory classes of genes (25Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). NF-Y1 has been shown to bind to more than 120 CCAAT-containing promoters (26Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It is composed of three subunits, NF-YA, -B, and -C, whose highly conserved genes have been cloned in mammals, yeast, plants, and parasites (27Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 119-127Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 28Li X.Y. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Mantovani R. Benoist C. Mathis D.J. Biol.

Mantovani R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 93: 119-125Crossref Google Scholar). All three subunits are required for CCAAT binding (32Caretti G. Motta M.C. Mantovani R. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2818-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The promoters of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin B2,cdk1, and cdc25C genes all contain CCAAT boxes, and it has been demonstrated that NF-Y modulates, at least in part, their activity during the cell cycle (11Zwicker J. Gross C. Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Ehlert F Engeland K. Muller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Farina A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Tiainen M.

Muller H. Manni I. Mossner J. Piaggio G. Mantovani R. Engeland K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether NF-Y is involved in the modulation of these promoter activities during the G2 arrest induced by DNA damage. For this purpose, we induced a G2 arrest by doxorubicin (Adriamycin; ADR)-mediated DNA damage in C2C12 nontransformed skeletal muscle cells, which possess a wild type p53 (35Soddu S. Blandino G. Scardigli R. Coen S. Marchetti A. Rizzo M.G. Bossi G. Imino L. Crescenzi M. Sacchi A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We found that ADR treatment down-regulates the promoter activities of the mitoticcyclins, cdk1, and cdc25C genes. This down-regulation involves a molecular mechanism requiring, at least in part, the CCAAT boxes and the transcription factor NF-Y. By using a dominant-negative p53 protein (DD-p53), we also show that the NF-Y-dependent down-regulation of mitoticcyclins, cdk1, and cdc25C occurs only in the presence of a functional p53 protein. DISCUSSIONThe progression through the G2 phase of the cell cycle is regulated in part by the cyclin A-cdk1 and cyclin B-cdk1 mitotic complexes (49Pines J. Hunter T. New Biol. 1990; 2: 389-401PubMed Google Scholar, 50Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Although it has been described that after DNA damage the mitotic entry is inhibited (18Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedlvy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar, 43Flatt P.M. Tang L.J. Scatena C.D. Szak S.T. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 87-96Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism sustaining the G2 arrest is not completely elucidated. In this report, we show that during the ADR-mediated G2 arrest, a decrease of protein expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cdk1, and cdc25C caused, at least in part, by a transcriptional level of regulation, is observed. Indeed, we demonstrate that after ADR treatment the promoter activities of thecyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin B2,cdk1, and cdc25C genes are down-regulated. These results indicate that key molecules that control G2/M transition in the normal cell cycle are transcriptionally modulated during the G2 checkpoint induced by DNA damage.The repression of cyclin B1, cyclin B2, andcdc25C promoters, occurring in the G2 arrest, requires the integrity of the CCAAT boxes present in the 5′ region of these genes, suggesting a role for the transcription factor NF-Y (Figs.3 and 4). It has been demonstrated previously that NF-Y binds the CCAAT boxes of cyclin B1, cyclin B2, andcdc25C promoters (11Zwicker J. Gross C. Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Ehlert F Engeland K. Muller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Farina A. Manni I. Fontemaggi G. Tiainen M. Cenciarelli C. Bellorini M. Mantovani R. Sacchi A. Piaggio G.

Engeland K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here we show that a functional NF-Y complex is required for the inhibition of cyclin B1, cyclin B2, and cdc25C promoters during G2 arrest. Indeed, the expression of a dominant-negative NF-YA abolishes the ADR-mediated repression of these promoters. Moreover, as already demonstrated, this is true also for thecdk1 promoter (24Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The down-regulation of expression and transcription of mitotic cyclin-cdk1 complexes, as well as of cdc25C phosphatase, after DNA damage requires the presence of a functional p53 protein (Fig. 8). In agreement with this result it has been reported that overexpression of p53 in p53-null cells suppresses the transcriptional activity of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin B2, and cdk1 promoters (19Innocente S.A.

Nevertheless, this is the first evidence that the cdc25C promoter activity is down-regulated also.None of the tested promoters contains a canonical DNA binding site for p53, thus our results lead to the speculation that p53 could interfere with the function of NF-Y. Indeed, it has been described that p53 protein can repress transcription by binding to and preventing the function of specific transcription factors (53Farmer G. Friedlander P. Colgan J. Manley J.L. Prives C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4281-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 54Gopalkrishnan R.V. Lam E.W.F. Kedinger C. J. Biol.

In shift experiments performed with anti NF-Y we observed that NF-Y is present on the CCAAT boxes of cyclin B1 and cyclin B2promoters before and after ADR-treatment. 2I. Manni, unpublished observations Thus, p53 does not interfere with the DNA binding of NF-Y. Another possibility is that p53 interferes with the NF-Y recruitment of coactivators and/or general transcription factors. Indeed, it has been shown that p53 and NF-Y bind to overlapping domains of the p300 coactivator (55Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Levine A.S. Kelly K.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and both p53 and NF-Y bind to TATA-binding protein (57Farmer G. Colgan J. Nakatani Y. Manley J.L. Prives C. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2174-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Interestingly, NF-Y was shown also by other groups to be required for the p53-mediated inhibition of cdk1 transcription (23Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.L. Schonthal A.H. Katula K.S. Stark G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NF-Y binds the CCAAT box contained in the cyclin A promoter (11Zwicker J. Gross C. Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Ehlert F Engeland K. Muller R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3822-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings lead to the speculation that NF-Y modulates cdk1 and cyclin A transcription after ADR-mediated G2 arrest by the same mechanism described here for the cyclin B1, cyclin B2, andcdc25C genes.It has been shown recently that an endogenous p53 protein sustains a G2 arrest induced by ADR through a pRb-dependent decrease of cyclin B1 and cdk1 expression (43Flatt P.M. Tang L.J. Scatena C.D. Szak S.T. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4210-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the pRb-dependent inhibition of cyclin B1 expression does not seem to be caused by direct binding of pRB/E2F family proteins to the cyclin B1 promoter. Indeed, as assessed by chromatin cross-linked immunoprecipitation, an anti-E2F1 antibody does not immunoprecipitate, from cycling cells, chromatin containing the cyclin B1 promoter, whereas an anti-NF-Y antibody does. 3S. Sciortino, unpublished observations. The transcriptional regulation of the expression of mitotic kinase complexes is not the only mechanism that sustains a G2block. Indeed, it has been demonstrated recently that in a human colorectal cancer cell line, the p53-dependent G2 arrest after γ-irradiation is the result of induction of 14–3-3ς expression (59Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Once overexpressed, 14–3-3ς blocks the cell cycle contributing to the nuclear exclusion of cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes and cdc25C phosphatase (60Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Thus, after DNA damage, transcriptional down-regulation of mitotic kinase complexes (this paper) and their cytoplasmic segregation (56Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6300-6315Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) might concomitantly sustain the G2 checkpoint.In summary, this work provides evidences that in muscle cells, the molecular mechanism responsible for the G2 checkpoint induced by ADR-mediated DNA damage involves the ability of the NF-Y transcription factor to prevent the transcription of key regulatory molecules essential for the progression through the G2phase of the cell cycle. This finding opens the question of whether other genes, controlled by NF-Y during the cell cycle (26Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), are targets of its activity in the cell cycle checkpoints. The progression through the G2 phase of the cell cycle is regulated in part by the cyclin A-cdk1 and cyclin B-cdk1 mitotic complexes (49Pines J. Hunter T.

Thus, after DNA damage, transcriptional down-regulation of mitotic kinase complexes (this paper) and their cytoplasmic segregation (56Li Q. Herrler M. Landsberger N. Kaludov N. Ogryzko V.V.

In summary, this work provides evidences that in muscle cells, the molecular mechanism responsible for the G2 checkpoint induced by ADR-mediated DNA damage involves the ability of the NF-Y transcription factor to prevent the transcription of key regulatory molecules essential for the progression through the G2phase of the cell cycle. This finding opens the question of whether other genes, controlled by NF-Y during the cell cycle (26Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), are targets of its activity in the cell cycle checkpoints.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inducible isoform of prostaglandin G/H synthase, is induced by mechanical loading-derived fluid shear stress in bone-forming cells such as osteoblasts and osteocytes. In this study, we investigated transcription factor and transcriptional regulatory elements responsible for the shear stress-induced COX-2 expression in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. When the cells were transfected with luciferase-reporter plasmids including the 5′-flanking region of the murine cox-2 gene, the fluid shear stress increased the luciferase activities, consistent with the induction of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression. Deletion analysis of the promoter region revealed that the shear stress-induced luciferase responses were regulated by two regions, −172 to −100 base pair (bp) and −79 to −46 bp, of the cox-2 promoter, in which putativecis-elements of C/EBP β, AP-1, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), and E box are included. Mutation of sites of C/EBP β, AP-1, and/or cAMP-response element decreased the shear stress-induced luciferase activities, whereas mutation of the E box did not affect the responses. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, shear stress enhanced nuclear extract binding to double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing C/EBP β and AP-1-binding motifs, and the bands of the complexes were supershifted by the addition of antibody specific for each regulator. Although the binding activity of CREB toward its probe was unaffected by shear stress, the phosphorylation of CREB was enhanced by the stress. These data suggest that C/EBP β, AP-1, and CREB play crucial roles in the shear stress-induced cox-2 expression in osteoblasts.

A decrease in the mechanical loading due to prolonged immobilization or weightlessness in space reduces the bone formation rate, resulting in bone loss (1Jadvar H. Aviat. Space Environ.

On the other hand, an increase in mechanical loading causes a gain in bone density (4Turner C.H. Pavalko F.M. J. Orthop.

Res. 1999; 14: 1222-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, bone tissue is sensitive to mechanical stimulation. Mechanical loading on bone generates extracellular matrix deformation and fluid flow, and the mechanical stimuli are translated to mechanical signals such as mechanical strain and fluid shear stress, respectively (6Cowin S.C. Bone ( NY ). 1998; 22 Suppl. 5: 119S-125SCrossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Evidence obtained fromin vitro studies indicates that osteocytes embedded in the lacunae/canaliculi system and osteoblasts and bone cells lining the bone surface are mechanosensors that detect load-derived mechanical stimuli (7Duncan R.L.

By these bone-forming cells, the mechanical stimuli are translated into cellular signaling factors. Mechanical stress induces the expressions of several kinds of proteins in bone-forming cells such as insulin-like growth factor-I and -II, transforming growth factor-β, osteocalcin, osteopontin, c-Fos, nitric-oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2,1 an isoform of prostaglandin G/H synthase), as reported in previous studies (9Perrone C.E.

In particular, the administration of NS-398, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, and indomethacin to rats in vivo inhibited mechanical loading-induced bone formation (16Forwood M.R. J. Bone Miner.

In addition, up-regulation of expression of some skeletal growth factors including insulin-like growth factor-I and transforming growth factor-β in response to mechanical stress was at least in part mediated by the PG production (10Klein-Nulend J.

Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1966-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PGs also regulate the differentiation and function of bone-resorbing cells such as osteoclasts (22Kawaguchi H. Pilbeam C.C. Harrison J.R. Raisz L.G. Clin. Orthop. 1995; 313: 36-46PubMed Google Scholar, 23Suzawa T. Miyaura C. Inada M. Maruyama T. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Suda T. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanical stress-induced PG production by bone forming-cells may modulate the overall process of bone metabolism to adapt the skeleton to the mechanical environment. Production of PGs is kinetically controlled mainly by the release of arachidonic acid and expression of COX-2 in response to a variety of stimuli (24Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). Fluid shear stress has been reported to stimulate rapidly PGE2 production in osteocytes through a cascade of sequential activation of cytoskeleton-associated Ca2+channel, phospholipase C, intracellular Ca2+, protein kinase C (PKC), and phospholipase A2 (25Ajubi N.E. Klein-Nulend J. Alblas M.J. Burger E.H. Nijweide P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E171-E178PubMed Google Scholar). Regarding COX-2 induction, it has been reported that cox-2 expression induced by fluid shear stress could be dependent on cytoskeleton-integrin interactions and intracellular calcium release mediated by inositol trisphosphate in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells (26Chen N.X. Ryder K.D. Pavalko F.M. Turner C.H. Burr D.B. Qiu J. Duncan R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C989-C997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there has been no report indicating transcription factors or transcriptional regulatory elements in the cox-2 promoter region responsible for the shear stress-induced cox-2transcription, whereas the cytokine- or growth factor-dependent factors and regulatory elements have been extensively reported (27Crofford L.J. Tan B. McCarthy C.J. Hla T. Arthritis & Rheum. 1997; 40: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 28Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol.

In the present study, we attempted to identify transcription factors and transcriptional regulatory elements located in 5′-flanking region of the cox-2 promoter gene that contribute to the shear stress-induced cox-2 expression. Here, we report our findings indicating that the cox-2 expression induced by fluid shear stress was mediated by C/EBP β, AP-1, and CREB, which bound to their respective sites on the cox-2 promoter gene in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. MC3T3-E1 cells (2500 cells/cm2) were seeded on type 1 collagen-coated slide glasses (Matsunami, Tokyo, Japan; 25 × 50 × 1 mm) in 100-mm plastic dishes and were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM, ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Intergen, NY) and 100 units/ml of penicillin G at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% air) as described previously (21Hakeda Y. Hotta T. Kurihara N. Ikeda E. Maeda N. Yagyu Y. Kumegawa M. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1966-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After 4 days, the culture medium was removed and replaced with fresh α-MEM containing 10% FBS. The removed medium was stored at 4 °C to be used as conditioned medium. The cells were cultured further for 3 more days prior to use in fluid shear stress experiments. A single-pass flow-through system was used. After MC3T3-E1 cells had been cultured on a slide glass (1-mm thick), the slide glass was carefully removed from and mounted on a parallel plate flow chamber that had been constructed by sandwiching silicone gaskets (1.5, 2, or 3 mm thick) between two acrylic plates, creating a flow channel (0.5, 1, or 2 mm deep × 25 mm wide ×50 mm long). Then the cells in the chamber were exposed to the fluid shear stress, which was generated by circulating the conditioned medium (0.36 ml/s) through a hydrostatic pump connected to the reservoirs at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The pH of the medium was kept constant by gassing with humidified 95% air and 5% CO2. As a control, the cells in the flow chamber were incubated for the same duration without having been exposed to the shear stress. When the rate of fluid flow is constant in the chamber, the magnitude of the shear stress is inversely proportional to the square of the depth of the flow channel. When the flow rate of the conditioned medium was 0.36 ml/s, the shear stress at 0.5-, 1.0-, and 2.0-mm depths of the flow channel was calculated to be 2.88, 0.72, and 0.18 dynes/cm2, respectively. After MC3T3-E1 cells had been subjected to shear stress for the desired time, total RNA (1 μg) extracted from the cells was used as a template for cDNA synthesis. cDNA was prepared by use of a Superscript II preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Primers were synthesized on the basis of the reported mouse cDNA sequences for COX-2 and β-actin. Sequences of the primers used for PCR were as follows: cox-2 forward, 5′-GGG TTG CTG GGG GAA GAA ATG TG-3′; COX-2 reverse, 5′-GGT GGC TGT TTT GGT AGG CTG TG-3′; β-actin forward, TCA CCC ACA CTG TGC CCA TCT AC-3′; β-actin reverse, 5′-GAG TAC TTG CGC TCA GGA GGA GC-3′. Amplification was carried out for 22–27 cycles under saturation, each at 94 °C, 45 s; 60 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 1 min in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 0.5 μl of each cDNA, 50 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). After amplification, 10 μl of each reaction mixture was analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands were then visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The PCR products for cox-2 and β-actin were 479 and 538 bp, respectively. Anti-COX-2, anti-c-Jun (sc-44x), anti-c-Fos (sc-253x), and anti-C/EBP β (sc-746x) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). Anti-CREB and anti-phospho-CREB antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). After exposure to shear stress, MC3T3-E1 was washed with PBS, scraped into a solution consisting of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm p-aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride (p-ABSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and sonicated for 15 s. The protein concentration in the cell lysate was measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and the proteins separated in the gel were subsequently electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After having been blocked with 5% skim milk, the membrane was incubated with anti-COX-2 antibody or nonimmune rabbit IgG and subsequently with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with Western blot chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase reporter pGL2 plasmid including 5′-flanking region of the murinecox-2 gene from −3195 to +39 bp was kindly provided by Dr. David L. DeWitt (Michigan State University). DNA fragments of various lengths of the cox-2 promoter regions were prepared by PCR using the above plasmid as a template and PyrobestTM DNA polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). Mutated fragments were prepared by two-stage bridge PCR, using mutated primers previously reported by Brunner et al. (32Brunner C. Kraft H.G. Utermann G. Muller H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These fragments were inserted into pGL2 basic vectors (Promega, Madison, WI), by using a Ligation kit version II® (Takara). MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured for 4 days on type 1 collagen-coated slide glasses in 100-mm dishes containing α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For transfection, the cells were treated for 24 h with plasmid DNA (0.7 μg) containing cox-2promoter and luciferase reporter gene, standard plasmid DNA (0.4 μg) containing β-galactosidase gene, and 18 μl of Effectene transfection reagent® (Qiagen) in 4 ml of α-MEM with 10% FBS. Then the medium was changed to 15 ml of α-MEM with 10% FBS, and the transfected cells were further cultured for 3 days. Thereafter, the transfected cells were placed in the flow shear stress chamber and subjected to fluid shear stress (2.88 dynes/cm2) for 6 h at 37 °C. Control cells were also placed in other chambers without fluid flow for the same period. The cells were then washed twice with cold PBS and were scraped in 200 μl of Reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities in the cell lysate were measured by using a microplate luminometer (MicroLumat LB96P, EG & G Berthold, Aliquippa, PA) and a luciferase assay system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instruction. For determination of β-galactosidase activity, the cell lysate (15 μl) was incubated in a 335-μl reaction buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5, 2 mm o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction was then terminated with 150 μl of 1 msodium carbonate, and the absorbance was measured at 420 nm. The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activities. A part of the cell lysate was used to fluorometrically determine DNA content by the method of Kissane and Robins (33Kissane J.M. Robins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 184-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In individual luciferase assays for deletion or mutation analysis, we always provided control cells that had been transfected with a reporter plasmid containing the cox-2 promoter region from −959 to +39 bp. The control cells were also subjected to shear stress together with cells transfected with other deleted or mutated reporter plasmids. The normalized luciferase activities in the cells transfected with various reporter plasmids were presented as percentage values, compared with the value of luciferase activities of the shear stress-loaded cells that had been transfected with the reporter plasmid containing thecox-2 promoter region from −959 to +39 bp. After MC3T3-E1 cells had been subjected to fluid shear stress for times indicated in the legends, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, incubated for 10 min on ice in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm p-ABSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin), and scraped. The cell lysates were incubated further for 10 min on ice and then transferred to tubes. The nuclei obtained by centrifugation for 1 min at 5,000 × g were extracted by a 30-min incubation in ice-cold buffer C, consisting of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 420 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm p-ABSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin. The extracts then were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). As shown in Table I, three oligonucleotides were synthesized on the basis of the sequence of putative binding sites of C/EBP-β, AP-1, and CREB located in the promoter region of the murinecox-2 gene. The AP-1 probes and CREB probes were partially mutated to avoid the cross-bindings of other transcription factors, because the sequences of probes for AP-1 and CREB overlapped in part with CRE-binding site and AP-1- and E-box-binding sites, respectively. The oligonucleotides were annealed with their complementary oligonucleotides. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were used as probes for EMSA. The nuclear extracts (1.8 μg of protein) were incubated in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol containing32P-labeled C/EBP β, AP-1, and CREB probes) for 20 min at room temperature. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by PAGE (5% gel) in 0.5× TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. For supershift experiments, the nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-c-Jun, anti-c-Fos, anti-C/EBP-β, anti-CREB, or anti-phospho-CREB antibody for 30 min on ice after binding to the oligonucleotides and then were subjected to PAGE.Table ISyntheses of double-stranded oligonucleotides as probes for mouse cox-2 geneThe constructed three double-strand oligonucleotide probes for C/EBP β, AP-1, and CREB were synthesized based on the sequence of each binding site in mouse cox-2 promoter gene.

When osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to 2.88 dynes/cm2 of fluid shear stress, expression ofcox-2 mRNA was increased as early as 1 h after the start of exposure and reached a maximum at 3 h (Fig.1 A). The increase in the expression continued at least for 9 h. The up-regulation ofcox-2 mRNA expression depended on the magnitude of the fluid shear stress, with a significant increase even at 0.18 dynes/cm2 (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the fluid shear stress also induced the expression of COX-2 protein in a time-dependent manner, with a maximal effect at 6 h after the shear stress application (Fig. 1 C). About 1,000 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the mousecox-2 gene contained various putative transcription response elements as described previously (28Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). When MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with luciferase-reporter plasmid including the 5′-flanking region of the cox-2 gene (−959 to +39 bp), luciferase activities in the cells were time-dependently increased in response to the fluid shear stress (2.88 dynes/cm2, Fig.2). A maximal increase was observed at 6 h after the shear stress application, consistent with the induction of COX-2 protein determined by the Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1 C). The increase in the luciferase activity was maintained up to 9 h. To identify what regions of the cox-2 promoter contributed to the shear stress-induced cox-2 transcription, we next constructed eight luciferase reporter plasmids containing various lengths of 5′-flanking region of the murine cox-2 gene as shown in Fig. 3. After each plasmid vector was introduced to MC3T3-E1 cells, the luciferase activities were measured at 6 h after application of fluid shear stress (2.88 dynes/cm2). As shown in Fig. 3, in the cells transfected with a plasmid having a region of cox-2 gene promoter from −959 to + 39 bp, an ∼4-fold increase in the activity was induced by the fluid shear stress. We defined this luciferase activity as 100% for comparison to the activities in the shear stress-loaded or -unloaded cells transfected with plasmids containing various deleted regions of the cox-2 gene promoter. The shear stress-induced luciferase activities were not decreased but rather increased by transfection with plasmids deleted from −959 to −172 bp. However, when the region from −172 to −100 bp in the promoter was deleted, the stimulatory effect of the shear stress on luciferase activity decreased markedly (Fig. 3). The shear stress-induced luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the plasmid deleted from −100 to −79 bp was the same as that in the cells transfected with the plasmid deleted from −172 to −100 bp. In addition, deletions from −79 to −46 bp further reduced the shear stress-induced luciferase activity. These deletion data suggested that two regions (−172 to −100 bp and −79 to −46 bp) represented possible shear stress-response elements. Based on analysis of consensus sequence, these regions contained presumedcis-elements for C/EBP β, AP-1, CRE, and E-box. To eliminate the possibility that the decreases in shear stress-induced luciferase activity were attributable to the difference in the length of the promoter region in the plasmids used, we introduced mutations in the presumed response elements in the same length of cox-2promoter (−959 to +39 bp) gene, as shown in Fig.4. Introduction of a mutation into CRE (1Jadvar H. Aviat. Space Environ. Med. 2000; 71: 640-646PubMed Google Scholar) (−447 to −440 bp), NF-κB (−401 to −393 bp), C/EBP β (2Kannus P. Jarvinen T.L.

On the other hand, a mutations in C/EBP β (1Jadvar H. Aviat. Space Environ. Med. 2000; 71: 640-646PubMed Google Scholar) (−138 to −130 bp), AP-1 (−73 to −61 bp), or CRE (2Kannus P. Jarvinen T.L.

Furthermore, to confirm the functional elements responsive to shear stress, we performed double and triple mutation analyses (Fig. 5). When both C/EBP β (1Jadvar H. Aviat. Space Environ.

Res. 1996; 11: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (−59 to −52 bp) sites were mutated, the shear stress-induced luciferase activity was further decreased to 14% of that in the shear stress-loaded cells transfected with the wild-type reporter plasmid containing the cox-2promoter gene (−959 to +39 bp). In addition, by triple mutation in C/EBP β (1Jadvar H. Aviat. Space Environ. Med. 2000; 71: 640-646PubMed Google Scholar) (−138 to −130 bp), AP-1 (−73 to −61 bp), and CRE (2Kannus P. Jarvinen T.L.

These results suggested that C/EBP β, AP-1, and CREB acted as functional transcription factors for up-regulation of cox-2transcript expression in response to the fluid shear stress.Figure 4Site mutation analysis of luciferase activities in response to fluid shear stress. The COX-2 gene promoter (−959 to +39 bp) was mutated at each putative transcriptional regulatory element by the two-stage Bridge PCR method. The mutated COX-2 gene promoters were ligated into pGL2 basic luciferase vectors.Lowercase letters in the upper sequence of each promoter indicate mutated bases, and the lower sequenceshows wild-type bases. Osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were transiently transfected with the wild-type (−959 to +39 bp) and mutated construct along with the β-galactosidase plasmid. The transfected cells were subjected or not subjected to shear stress at 2.88 dynes/cm2 for 6 h and then assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities.

https://openalex.org/W2110305256,"Sgk (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase) is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that is transcriptionally regulated by serum, glucorticoids, and mineralocorticoids. Sgk regulates the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel in kidney principal cells. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulate activity of Sgk by a mechanism mediated by phosphoinositide-dependent kinases (PDK)-1 and -2. In this study, we demonstrate that incubation of transfected cells with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (8CPT-cAMP; 0.2 mm) led to a 2-fold activation of recombinant Sgk expressed in COS7 cells. Furthermore, the combination of insulin plus 8CPT-cAMP elicited a larger response than either agent alone. The effect of insulin was inhibited by wortmannin (100 nm), but not by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor, H89 (10 μm). As expected, the effect of 8CPT-cAMP was completely blocked by H89. Surprisingly, the effect of 8CPT-cAMP was also inhibited by wortmannin, suggesting that phosphorylation of Sgk by PDK-1 and/or -2 is required for activation by 8CPT-cAMP. Mutational analysis led to similar conclusions. The Thr369 → Ala mutant, lacking the PKA phosphorylation site, was activated by insulin but not 8CPT-cAMP. In contrast, the Ser422 → Ala mutant, lacking a PDK-2 phosphorylation site, was inactive and resistant to activation by either insulin or 8CPT-cAMP. In summary, Sgk is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms. In addition to regulation at the level of gene expression, the enzymatic activity of Sgk is regulated by multiple protein kinases, including PKA, PDK-1, and PDK-2. Cross-talk among these signaling pathways may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the hypertension associated with hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and insulin resistance.

Transepithelial sodium transport is an essential physiological function regulated by multiple hormone systems, including aldosterone, vasopressin, and insulin. Recent evidence has suggested that Sgk is an important molecular target that integrates the multiple endocrine inputs regulating sodium transport. Expression of the Sgk gene is regulated at the transcriptional level by serum, glucocorticoids, and aldosterone, all of which up-regulate gene transcription (2Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L.

Furthermore, insulin as well as insulin-like growth factors stimulate Sgk activity by a mechanism requiring the participation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase leads to activation of two downstream protein kinase activities: phosphoinositide-dependent kinases (PDK)-1 and -2. Phosphorylation of Thr256 and Ser422 by PDK-1 and -2, respectively, leads to activation of Sgk (4Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 5Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Thr369 of Sgk is contained within a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (6Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 7Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because vasopressin leads to activation of adenylate cyclase (8Beck N.P. Kaneko T. Zor U. Field J.B. Davis B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1971; 50: 2461-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that phosphorylation of Sgk by protein kinase A (PKA) might mediate the action of vasopressin to stimulate sodium transport. In the present study, we obtained evidence that cyclic AMP activates recombinant Sgk expressed in COS7 cells. Moreover, cyclic AMP-induced activation of Sgk is inhibited by H89, a PKA inhibitor, and also by mutation of the putative PKA phosphorylation site (Thr369 → Ala). In addition, we obtained evidence that phosphorylation by PDK-1 and/or PDK-2 is required for the ability of cyclic AMP to activate Sgk. These data provide additional evidence elucidating the mechanisms whereby Sgk mediates endocrine regulation of sodium transport. We searched GenBankTM and identified several expressed sequence tags corresponding to human Sgk. Clones 645185 and 42669 were obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and were found to contain the complete coding sequence of Sgk1. Clone 645185, which contained the complete coding sequence of the enzyme, was used in our experiments. We used polymerase chain reaction (KlenTaq,CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to introduce both a strong Kozak consensus sequence at the translation start site and a Myc-epitope tag at the N terminus. The cDNA, flanked by anEcoRI site upstream and a NotI site downstream, was ligated into the TA Cloning pCRTM 2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and subcloned into the multiple cloning sites of pcDNA 3.1+ (Invitrogen), pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI), and pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). In addition, using a polymerase chain reaction-based method (Quick change Site-directed mutagenesis Kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) we introduced the following three mutations into the coding sequence of Sgk: Thr369 → Ala, Ser422 → Ala, and Thr256 → Ala. All the mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using reagents supplied in the DNA Sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). COS7 cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105cells/ml in six-well plates and cultured overnight in DMEM-low glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The following day, cells were transfected with expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. We used pCI-neo Myc-Sgk (600 ng/well) to express Sgk in the studies of in vitrokinase activity, and in most of the 32P labeling studies. pEGFP-C1 Myc-Sgk (600 ng/well) was used for the 32P labeling study of the phosphorylation of the Sgk-GFP fusion protein (Fig. 6 B). Three hours after transfecting the cells, the transfection medium was diluted 1:1 with DMEM medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. The next day the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml and streptomycin, 100 μg/ml). Twelve hours later, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium (DMEM containing insulin-free bovine serum albumin (0.1%) plus antibiotics). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of human recombinant insulin (1 μm; Sigma) or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (0.2 mm; 8CPT-cAMP; Sigma). Insulin was added 20 min prior to the time of cell lysis; and 8CPT-cAMP (9Tasken K.A. Jacobsen F.W. Eikvar L. Hansson V. Haugen T.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was added 60 min prior to lysing the cells. In some experiments, we added various inhibitors 100 min prior to lysing the cells: wortmannin (100 nm) (5Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), H89 (10 μm) (10Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or okadaic acid (600 nm) (11Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). H89 was dissolved in DMEM while wortmannin and okadaic acid were dissolved in Me2SO. In each case, an equal volume of solvent was added to cell cultures lacking the inhibitor. Wortmanin and H89 were obtained from Calbiochem, while okadaic acid was supplied by Sigma. The cell monolayers were then solubilized in solubilization buffer (300 μl/well) for 20 min at 4 °C: Tris, 50 mm, pH 7.8; NaCl, 300 mm; Triton X-100, 0.5%; protease inhibitors CompleteTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and phosphatase inhibitors (NaF, 100 mm; sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm; sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm; EDTA, 5 mm). Extracts from two replicate wells were pooled, and an aliquot (100 μl) was analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to assess the expression of Myc-Sgk. A second aliquot (450 μl) was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (30 μl) for the immune complex kinase assay (12Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Antibody was prebound to protein G-UltraLink (15 μl; Pierce) at 4 °C for 120 min. The immobilized antibody was sedimented, washed, and incubated with cell extract overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The immune complexes were sedimented and washed three times with solubilization buffer and twice with a kinase buffer (Tris, 20 mm, pH 7.4; MgCl2, 10 mm). Pellets were finally resuspended in kinase buffer containing ATP (5 μm), protein kinase A inhibitor (1 μm; Sigma), dithiothreitol (1 mm), [γ-32P]ATP (0.02 mCi/sample), and Arg-Pro-Arg-Thr-Ser-Thr-Phe peptide substrate (1 mm) (5Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The reaction was allowed to occur for 30 min at room temperature, with gentle agitation, prior to stopping with 10 μl of stopping solution (ATP, 1 mm; bovine serum albumin, 1%; HCl, 0.6% w/v). The reaction mix was centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Supernatants (20 μl) were applied to a 2.1-cm diameter p81 Whatman paper. After drying at room temperature, the filter was washed four times with phosphoric acid (25 mm), once with acetone, and then counted in a scintillation counter. Background incorporation of radioactivity was estimated by assaying extracts prepared from untransfected cells incubated in the presence or absence of insulin or 8CPT-cAMP. To determine the kinase activity of Sgk, we subtracted the average level of background 32P incorporation from 32P incorporation catalyzed by extracts of transfected cells. After ∼16 h of serum starvation (see above), the medium was replaced with 2 ml/well of phosphate-free RPMI 1640 (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) containing insulin-free bovine serum albumin (0.1%). Two hours later, the medium was exchanged for 1 ml/well of the same medium supplemented with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (0.25 mCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (13Perrotti N. Accili D. Marcus-Samuels B. Rees-Jones R.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3137-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of insulin (see above), the medium was aspirated, and the cells were frozen on methanol-dry ice. Monolayers were then solubilized with 300 μl/well of lysis buffer (see above) for 20 min at 4 °C. For each experimental point, the extracts from two wells were pooled. The Triton extracts were clarified by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (14,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C) and immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Myc antibody (see above). However, instead of washing with kinase buffer, the pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (1 mm), boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 10% gel. The 32P-labeled proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell) and detected both by autoradiography and immunodetection with mouse anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The amino acid sequence of Sgk contains a potential protein kinase A phosphorylation site: Lys-Lys-Ile-Thr-Pro (amino acid residues 366–370). Therefore, we investigated the effects of cyclic AMP upon Myc-Sgk activity. After transiently expressing Myc-Sgk in COS7 cells, the transfected cells were incubated in the presence or absence of cyclic AMP, insulin, or both. Subsequently, the cells were lysed in detergent, Myc-Sgk was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and Sgk activity was assayed in immune complexes. Incubation of cells in the presence of 8CPT-cAMP (0.2 mm) for 60 min led to a 2-fold activation of Myc-Sgk (p = 0.0007; Fig.1 A, lane 3). As expected, incubation with insulin for 20 min increased Myc-Sgk activity by 3-fold (p = 0.0002; Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Since neither insulin nor cAMP affected the quantity of Myc-Sgk contained in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 3), we conclude that cAMP and insulin increased the specific activity of the enzyme. H89 (10 μm), an inhibitor of protein kinase A, blocked the effect of 8CPT-cAMP (Fig.2 A, column 7), but did not interfere with the ability of insulin to stimulate the kinase activity of Myc-Sgk (Fig. 2 A, column 6). As shown previously (4Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 5Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), wortmannin (100 nm) inhibited the effect of insulin to activate Sgk (Fig. 2 B, column 6). However, unexpectedly, wortmannin also inhibited the ability of 8CPT-cAMP to activate Myc-Sgk (Fig. 2 B, column 7) and inhibited the combined effect of the insulin plus 8CPT-cAMP (Fig.2 B, column 8). -We carried out mutational studies to investigate the role of the various phosphorylation sites. Thr369 → Ala mutant Myc-Sgk, which lacks the predicted phosphorylation site for protein kinase A, is unable to undergo activation in response to 8CPT-cAMP (p = 0.39; Fig. 3,column 7). This observation suggests that phosphorylation of Thr369,presumably catalyzed by protein kinase A, mediates activation of Sgk in response to cAMP. In contrast, Thr369→ Ala mutant Myc-Sgk underwent normal activation in response to insulin (p = 0.0002; Fig. 3, column 6). Thr256 and Ser422 of Sgk are the phosphorylation sites for PDK1 and PDK2, respectively. As expected, Ser422 → Ala mutant Myc-Sgk was not activated by insulin (Fig. 4, column 6). Moreover, despite the fact that the protein kinase A phosphorylation site is intact, the Ser422 → Ala mutant does not undergo activation in response to 8CPT-cAMP (Fig. 4, column 7). Similar results were obtained with Thr256 → Ala mutant Myc-Sgk (data not shown). These results are consistent with the observations reported above, demonstrating that wortmannin inhibits activation of Myc-Sgk in response to either 8-CPT-cAMP or insulin (Fig.2). Thus, phosphorylation by PKA is not sufficient to activate Myc-Sgk; phosphorylation of Ser422 and Thr256, presumably by PDK2 and PDK1, is also required. Using immunoblotting to analyze solubilized extracts from transfected cells expressing Myc-Sgk, we detected two major bands corresponding to recombinant Myc-Sgk: a darkMr 51,000 band and a lightMr 49,000 band, designated B2 and B1, respectively (Fig. 1 B, upper panel, lane 1). Insulin did not alter the relative intensities of B1 and B2 compared with untreated samples (Fig. 1 B, upper panel, lane 2). In contrast, 8CPT-cAMP increased the intensity of B1 when added alone (Fig. 1 B, upper panel, lane 3) or in combination with insulin (Fig.1 B, upper panel, lane 4). H89 and wortmannin do not inhibit the ability of 8CPT-cAMP to increase the intensity of the faster migrating band, B1 (Fig.5 A, lanes 4 and8). Likewise, this effect was also observed with the two mutant forms of Myc-Sgk: Thr369 → Ala and Ser422 → Ala (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2–4). Thus, the shift in electrophoretic mobility does not appear to require phosphorylation by PKA or PDK-2 and does not seem to be related to the activation of the enzymatic activity of Sgk. When films were overexposed, additional weak bands of slower mobility, designated B3, were detected in extracts of cells that had been stimulated with either insulin or 8CPT-cAMP (Fig. 1 B,lower panel, lanes 2–4). Intact cell phosphorylation studies (see below) suggested that the cluster of low mobility bands (B3) represents hyperphosphorylated forms of Sgk. Cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated by insulin and/or 8CPT-cAMP. Under these conditions, the fastest migrating species (B1) detected by c-Myc antibody (Fig.6 A, left panel,lanes 1–5) was not phosphorylated (Fig. 6 A,right panel, lanes 1–5). On the other hand, insulin, 8CPT-cAMP, and okadaic acid induced the appearance of a highly phosphorylated slower mobility form of Sgk (B3) (Fig. 6 A,right panel, lanes 1–5). The intensity of the slow migrating band (B3) correlates well with the extent of activation of Myc-Sgk, being maximal in cells incubated with both insulin and 8CPT-cAMP, but somewhat less intense in cells incubated with either agent alone. Although band B2 is much more intense than band B3 in the anti-Myc immunoblots, band B3 is easily detected in the 32P labeling studies. This suggests that the B3 species is highly phosphorylated, presumably with multiple sites being phosphorylated. Nevertheless the B2 species also contains 32P, even in the absence of insulin and 8CPT-cAMP. There are at least two possible interpretations of the significance of the B3 band, the intensity of which is increased in response to insulin, 8CPT-cAMP, and okadaic acid. First, because none of the Sgk bands were present in nontransfected cells (Fig. 6 A,left and right panels, lane C), it seemed likely that the B2 and B3 bands corresponded to different forms (e.g. different phosphorylation states) of Myc-Sgk. Alternatively, it was possible that one band might have represented a tightly bound substrate for Sgk. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we transfected cells with a Sgk-GFP fusion protein (Fig.6 B). By fusing Sgk to the GFP moiety, we shifted both bands to higher molecular mass (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4 and5). This demonstrates that both bands are forms of the Myc-Sgk molecule, rather than substrates for phosphorylation by Sgk. Incubation of cells in the presence of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a, led to a 10-fold increase in the activity of Myc-Sgk (Fig.7, column 1 versus column 5). Indeed, the effect of okadaic acid was greater than the effects of either insulin or 8CPT-cAMP. Nevertheless, both agents were able to further increase Sgk activity even in the presence of okadaic acid (600 nm): p = 0.033 (insulin) andp = 0.039 (8CPT-cAMP). When the phosphorylation sites for PDK-2 (Ser422Ala-mutant; Fig. 8,columns 9–16) and PDK-2 (Thr256 → Ala mutant; data not shown) were abolished, this blocked the ability of okadaic acid to activate Myc-Sgk. In contrast, abolishing the protein kinase A phosphorylation site (Thr369 → Ala mutant; Fig.9, lanes 13–16) did not impair the ability of okadaic acid to activate Myc-Sgk.Figure 8The PDK2 phosphorylation site in Sgk is required for activation by okadaic acid. COS7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for either Myc-Sgk or the Ser422 → Ala mutant Myc-Sgk in experiments similar to those described in the legend to Fig. 1.

Interestingly, like 8CPT-cAMP, okadaic acid increased the relative intensity of B1 (i.e. the B1:B2 ratio; Fig. 6A, left panels, lanes 1, 2, and 5). The observation was confirmed in separate experiments, where okadaic acid was added alone or in combination with insulin and 8CPT-cAMP (Fig. 5 B,lanes 2–9). The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in principal cells of the kidney plays a central role in determining sodium balance. Because this channel is responsible for reabsorbing the majority of the sodium in the glomerular filtrate, even small changes in activity of the channel can have large effects upon the quantity of sodium excreted in the urine. In keeping with its important physiological role, the activity of ENaC is highly regulated. It has recently been demonstrated that Sgk activates ENaC. Moreover, Sgk is itself highly regulated. For example, transcription of the Sgk gene has been reported to be up-regulated by both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids (2Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 3Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and also by follicle-stimulating hormone (14Alliston T.N. Maiyar A.C. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1934-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Alliston T.N. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.A.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1318-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Sgk can be phosphorylated on Thr256 and Ser422 by PDK-1 and -2, respectively; these phosphorylations mediate the ability of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and serum to activate Sgk (4Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 5Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these two phosphorylations may occur in a sequential fashion (5Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). First, insulin stimulates PDK-2 to phosphorylate Ser422, and this renders Sgk a better substrate for PDK-1, which phosphorylates Thr256. It is the phosphorylation of Thr256 by PDK-1 that is believed to be responsible for activation of Sgk (5Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In this publication, we demonstrate that cAMP can activate Sgk and that this effect is mediated by PKA, which directly phosphorylates Thr369 in Sgk. This hypothesis is supported by two principal lines of evidence: (a) activation of Sgk by 8CPT-cAMP is inhibited by H89, an inhibitor of PKA activity; and (b) substitution of Ala for Thr369 abolishes the PKA phosphorylation site in Sgk and also abolishes the ability of 8CPT-cAMP to activate Sgk. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that phosphorylation by PKA is required for activation of Sgk in response to 8CPT-cAMP. However, two observations suggest that phosphorylation of Thr369 is not sufficient to activate Sgk: (a) wortmannin markedly inhibits the ability of 8CPT-cAMP to activate Sgk; and (b) mutation of the PDK-1 and PDK-2 phosphorylation sites (Thr256 and Ser422, respectively) prevents activation of Sgk in response to 8CPT-cAMP. Although the requirement for multisite phosphorylation has not yet been fully explained, we would like to propose one possible mechanism. When PKA phosphorylates Thr369, this might make Sgk a better substrate for phosphorylation of Thr256 and Ser422 by PDK-1 and PDK-2, respectively. According to this hypothesis, phosphorylation of Thr369 renders Sgk such a good substrate that it can be phosphorylated by the basal activities of PDK-1 and PDK-2 without the need for insulin to activate those two enzymes. The resulting phosphorylation of Thr256 and Ser422 is sufficient to activate Sgk (4Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 5Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In contrast, although phosphorylation of Thr256 and Ser422 is required for insulin-stimulated activation of Sgk, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Thr369 is not required for activation in response to insulin. Furthermore, Ser422is required for activation of Sgk in response to okadaic acid, whereas Thr369 is not required. These observations suggest that phosphorylation by PDK-1 and/or PDK-2 are the principal protein kinases responsible for activating Sgk. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a, also leads to activation of Myc-Sgk. Taken together, these observations suggest that either protein phosphatase 1 or 2a is responsible for dephosphorylating Thr256 and Ser422, thereby inactivating Sgk. After this work was completed, Gonzalez-Robayna et al. (15Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Alliston T.N. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.A.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1318-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that protein kinase A contributed to mediating the action of follicle-stimulating hormone to increase Sgk activity in ovarian granulosa cells. They particularly emphasized the role of cAMP in inducing transcription of the Sgk gene. Moreover, they concluded that cAMP triggered a pathway that activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Nevertheless, these mechanisms are not sufficient to account for our observations. Our mutational studies provide strong direct evidence that activation in response to cAMP requires direct phosphorylation of Sgk by protein kinase A inasmuch as mutation of the protein kinase A phosphorylation site abolishes the response. In contrast, the same mutation does not impair the ability of the enzyme to be activated in response to insulin, a response that is mediated by PDK-1 and -2 but that does not require of Thr369 in Sgk by protein kinase A. When Myc-Sgk was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody, we detected two closely spaced bands withMr of 49,000 and 51,000 (designated as B1 and B2, respectively). In addition, when the blots were overexposed, we detected a third lower mobility band (designated B3) in extracts of cells that were stimulated with insulin and/or 8CPT-cAMP. Interestingly, 8CPT-cAMP increased the intensity of B1 (i.e.the highest mobility band). The alteration in electrophoretic mobility of B1 is likely due to a covalent modification of the protein. While the nature of this covalent modification is unknown, 32P labeling experiments carried out in intact cells suggest that B1 is not phosphorylated. Rather, it is possible that 8CPT-cAMP triggers a proteolytic cleavage that accounts for the decrease in apparent molecular mass. Several lines of evidence suggest that this 8CPT-cAMP-induced gel shift is not related to Sgk activation. For example, the mobility shift is observed with both Ser422→ Ala- and Thr369 → Ala-Myc-Sgk although these mutant forms of the enzyme are resistant to activation by 8CPT-cAMP. Furthermore, even at low concentrations (0.05–0.10 mm), which did not activate Myc-Sgk, 8CPT-cAMP increased the intensity of the B1 band (data not shown). In contrast, B2 and B3 are both phosphorylated forms of Sgk. However, by comparing the immunoblots with the autoradiographs of32P-labeled Myc-Sgk, we conclude that the stoichiometry of phosphorylation is higher for B3 than for B2. It is likely that the hyperphosphorylation accounts for the decreased electrophoretic mobility of B3. Furthermore, the intensity of B3 is increased in response to either insulin and/or 8CPT-cAMP, which correlates with activation of the enzyme. In the immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 6 A), band B3 is considerably weaker than band B2, suggesting that only a small percentage of Myc-Sgk molecules become hyperphosphorylated. If B3 represents the activated species, this observation suggests that a relatively small minority of Myc-Sgk molecules are responsible for the majority of Sgk activity. It is unclear why such a small percentage of Sgk molecules become hyperphosphorylated in response to insulin and/or cAMP. cAMP functions as the second messenger for multiple signaling pathways. Thus, the existence of a PKA phosphorylation site in Sgk provides opportunities for regulation in many tissues. Three distinct isoenzymes of Sgk have been reported. While Sgk1 and Sgk3 are widely expressed in many tissues, Sgk2 has a more limited pattern of expression, i.e.liver, kidney, pancreas, and brain (6Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Interestingly, while the protein kinase A phosphorylation site is conserved in both Sgk1 and Sgk2, it does not appear to be present in the sequence of Sgk3. In contrast, the phosphorylation sites for phosphoinositide kinases are conserved in all three isoforms. In the kidney, activation of Sgk by PKA may mediate the ability of vasopressin to stimulate sodium transport (16Reif M.C. Troutman S.L. Schafer J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been reported that wortmannin inhibits vasopressin-induced sodium transport (17Edinger R.S. Rokaw M.D. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F575-F579PubMed Google Scholar), a result in agreement with our findings. Furthermore, there is evidence that cAMP exerts regulatory influences upon Sgk in extra-renal tissues. For example, it has been reported that follicle-stimulating hormone activates Sgk in the ovary (14Alliston T.N. Maiyar A.C. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1934-1949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Alliston T.N. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.A.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1318-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the role in normal physiology, it is possible that Sgk may play important roles in the pathophysiology of various disease states."
https://openalex.org/W1993886090,"Abstract We have investigated the signaling pathways underlying muscarinic receptor-induced calcium oscillations in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Activation of muscarinic receptors with a maximal concentration of carbachol (100 μm) induced a biphasic rise in cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]i) comprised of release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space. A lower concentration of carbachol (5 μm) induced repetitive [Ca2+]i spikes or oscillations, the continuation of which was dependent on extracellular Ca2+. The entry of Ca2+ with 100 μm carbachol and with the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, was completely blocked by 1 μmGd3+, as well as 30–100 μm concentrations of the membrane-permeant inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inhibitor, 2-aminoethyoxydiphenyl borane (2-APB). Sensitivity to these inhibitors is indicative of capacitative calcium entry. Arachidonic acid, a candidate signal for Ca2+ entry associated with [Ca2+]i oscillations in HEK293 cells, induced entry that was inhibited only by much higher concentrations of Gd3+ and was unaffected by 100 μm 2-APB. Like arachidonic acid-induced entry, the entry associated with [Ca2+]i oscillations was insensitive to inhibition by Gd3+ but was completely blocked by 100 μm 2-APB. These findings indicate that the signaling pathway responsible for the Ca2+ entry driving [Ca2+]i oscillations in HEK293 cells is more complex than originally thought, and may involve neither capacitative calcium entry nor a role for PLA2 and arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2056227160,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of tissue-specific genes have not yet been fully clarified. We analyzed the methylation status of specific CCGG sites in the 5′-flanking region and exon 1 of myogeningene, a very important myogenic differentiation factor. We demonstrated a loss of methylation, at the onset of C2C12 muscle cell line differentiation, limited to the CCGG site of myogenin 5′-flanking region, which was strongly correlated with the transcriptional activation of this gene and with myogenic differentiation. The same CCGG site was also found to be hypomethylated, in vivo, in embryonic mouse muscle (a myogenin-expressing tissue), as opposed to nonmuscle (nonexpressing) tissues that had a fully methylated site. In a C2C12-derived clone with enhanced myogenic ability, demethylation occurred within 2 h of induction of differentiation, suggesting the involvement of some active demethylation mechanism(s) that occur in the absence of DNA replication. Exposure to drugs that inhibit DNA methylation by acting on the S-adenosylmethionine metabolism produced a further reduction, to a few minutes, in the duration of the demethylation dynamics. These effects suggest that the final site-specific DNA methylation pattern of tissue-specific genes is defined through a continuous, relatively fast interplay between active DNA demethylation and re-methylation mechanisms.

S-adenosylmethionine creatine kinase S-adenosylhomocysteine molecular weight marker reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction nucleotides base pair Cytosine methylation is, in eukaryotic nuclear DNA, a well established epigenetic mechanism that controls the expression of housekeeping and possibly also tissue-specific genes (1Bergman Y.

In fact, during early embryogenesis, the original gamete methylation pattern is erased, and most of the DNA in the blastocyst becomes demethylated. After implantation, a de novo methylation activity produces in the gastrula a methylation pattern characteristic of the adult animal. During the subsequent development, tissue-specific genes undergo specific demethylation events required for their transcriptional activation, according to the general paradigm of an inverse correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression. Knock-out experiments have highlighted the lethality of even modest abnormal methylation patterns in the embryo (17Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). There are, in addition, several lines of evidence indicating that endogenous genes can be activated by demethylating agents and that exogenous methylated genes are not expressed when transfected into cells but that their expression is re-activated by demethylating agents (18Jones P.A.

Despite many years of intense studies on DNA methylation, neither the mechanism that regulates this process nor its exact functional role in the activation of genes has been fully clarified. Two steps need to be considered as follows: 1) the creation of a methylation pattern in the DNA control region of a gene, and 2) the effect of this methylation pattern on the activity of that gene. As regards the latter step, new light on the role of DNA methylation in gene transcription has been shed by the three-way connection between DNA methylation, chromatin structure, and gene activity (22Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), resulting from the methyl-CpG-binding proteins and a repression multiprotein complex that includes histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 (23Eden S. Hashimshony T. Keshet I. Cedar H. Thorne A.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 842Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 24Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1394-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar); a pivotal role of methylcytosine as primary modification in establishing and maintaining several genes in an inactive state has thus been demonstrated. The former step is somewhat more complex. Two main mechanisms have been proposed for the creation and maintenance of methylation patterns. There is, on the one hand, a methylating activity based on DNA methyltransferase enzymes that can methylate the cytosine either in a process of reproduction of previously established methylation patterns (maintenance methylation) or in a process of creation of new methylation patterns (de novo methylation) (28Bird A.P. Science. 1999; 286: 2287-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. J. Biol.

Genet. 1999; 23: 380-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Some distinction between several DNA methyltransferases specific for either maintenance or de novo methylation has emerged (31Hsu D.-W. Lin M.-J. Lee T.-L. Wen S.-C. Chen X. Shen C.-K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9751-9756Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). In all these methylation reactions,S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)1 has a pivotal role as a methyl donor (33Chiang P.K. Gordon R.K. Tal J. Zeng G.C. Doctor B.P. Pardhasaradhi K. McCann P.P. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Hypomethylation can thus arise from the absence of methylation activity after DNA replication (passive demethylation). On the other hand, some experimental results point, as an alternative pathway, to some active shaping of methylation patterns and in particular to active mechanisms of removal of methyl moiety (active demethylation) that do not require DNA replication. So far three kinds of such mechanisms have been proposed as follows: 1) a dinucleotide-exchange reaction (34Weiss A. Keshet I. Razin A. Cedar H. Cell. 1996; 86: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); 2) a glycosylase-based mechanism that removes the 5-methylcytosine moiety, the overall demethylation process then being completed through the involvement of mismatch repair enzymes (35Jost J.-P. Fremont M. Siegmann M. Hofsteenge J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4545-4550Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); and 3) the direct removal of the methyl group from 5-methylcytosine residues in DNA, by a reaction catalyzed by a real DNA demethylase (36Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), which unlike the other mechanisms would be reversible (37Ramchandani S. Bhattacharya S.K. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6107-6112Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Despite this variety of demethylating pathways, a number of aspects are still somewhat obscure. In fact, it is not clear whether these mechanisms, taken together or individually, can mediate not only a stable repression of genes that have to be silenced permanently but also a transient repression of other genes that need to be switched on or off in response to variations in physiological conditions (e.g. to developmental and/or environmental stimuli) and to be expressed only in specific tissue(s) at the right time. In ∼98% of a mammalian genome, CpG dinucleotides are less frequent than would be expected, and their cytosine moiety is almost constantly methylated. The remaining 2% of the genome, however, contains the so-called CpG islands (2Cross S.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1995; 5: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 38Bird A.P. Trends Genet. 1987; 3: 342-347Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (649) Google Scholar), where these dinucleotides are densely clustered, more frequently than expected and unmethylated. It is not yet clear whether the presence or absence of a CpG island in the control region of genes may influence any of the previously described mechanisms. Approximately one-half of mammalian genes, comprising the totality of housekeeping genes and a minority of tissue-specific genes, are reported to have a CpG island at their 5′ end; the majority of tissue-specific genes, however, are not associated with an island (39Antequera F. Bird A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11995-11999Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 40Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (3032) Google Scholar). The housekeeping genes associated with unmethylated islands are transcriptionally active, whereas in most cell types the tissue-specific genes associated with unmethylated islands are, as a rule, transcriptionally inactive. These results raise questions as to the mechanism activating the transcription of genes in a tissue-specific manner and to how CpG sites are methylated to affect stable and/or transient repression. The relative contribution to the final methylation pattern of each of the aforementioned mechanisms, and their possible interconnection, which lead to the final expression pattern, has yet to be addressed. A crucial point is whether these mechanisms provide the high level of plasticity required for the regulation of the expression of tissue-specific genes. Of the several tissue-specific transcription factors that have been identified in mammalian cell types, the muscle regulatory factors, which belong to the basic helix-loop-helix family (41Arnold H.H. Winter B. Development. 1998; 8: 539-544Google Scholar, 42Li L. Olson E.N. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 38: 95-119Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 43Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and are involved in the commitment to myogenic fate and in muscle terminal differentiation, are unique in terms of their ability to control a very complex array of tissue-specific genes. The high level of structural and functional characterization of these genes and their highly integrated auto- and cross-activating network define the muscle as one of the most useful cellular systems for the clarification of mechanisms of tissue-specific gene regulation during differentiation. Of particular interest, from this point of view, are those genes that, at the onset of cell differentiation, show a definite on/off switch closely connected with strict transcriptional control; a typical example is the myogenin gene (44Edmonson D.G. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 628-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 45Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K.

The aim of this work was to study, during muscle differentiation, the structural and temporal variation of the methylation pattern ofmyogenin. For this purpose, we used the HpaII/PCR technique (55Singer-Sam J. Le Bon J.M. Tanguay R.L. Riggs A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 18: 687Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 56Singer-Sam J. Grant M.

Biol. 1990; 10: 4987-4989Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), optimized as a multiplex assay, to study the methylation status of a single CpG site of myogenin5′-flanking region and of the three CpG sites of exon 1, and to relate our findings to the transcriptional activation of this gene. We demonstrated a strong correlation between the temporal dynamics of demethylation of the sole CpG site of the 5′-flanking region andmyogenin expression. In vivo, themyogenin 5′-flanking region was found to be fully methylated in nonmuscle tissues, partially methylated in adult muscle (where nomyogenin expression was detected), and demethylated in fetal muscle where, by contrast, myogenin was expressed at high levels. The fact that the dynamics of hypomethylation inductionin vitro did not last nearly as long as the cell cycle supports the idea of active demethylation mechanisms. However, the presence of 3-deaza-adenosine, an inhibitor of biological methylation reactions based on the AdoMet metabolism (33Chiang P.K. Gordon R.K. Tal J. Zeng G.C. Doctor B.P. Pardhasaradhi K.

Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1985: 47-65Google Scholar), together with homocysteine to enhance its inhibitory effect, further shortened the duration of the dynamics of demethylation, which suggests that re-methylation mechanisms are also involved. For myogenin,these findings point to the following: 1) an interplay between active demethylation and re-methylation mechanisms in the definition of the final methylation pattern of the gene, and 2) a physiological role, in the definition of the transcriptional status of this gene, of the demethylation dynamics of the CpG site present in its 5′-flanking region. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The Megaprime DNA labeling system was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Radiochemicals were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Centri-Sep columns were from Princeton Separations (Adelphia, NJ). DH5α bacteria were from Life Technologies, Inc. The CK-NAC kit was from Abbott. Oligo(dT)16 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (cloned), SuperTaq (Thermus thermophilus DNA polymerase, Hoffmann-La Roche), human placental ribonuclease inhibitor, buffer for reverse transcription, buffer for PCR, and φX/HaeIII marker were obtained from HT Biotechnology Ltd. (Cambridge, UK). Oligonucleotides used as primers were synthesized by M-Medical GENENCO (Firenze, Italy). 3-Deaza-adenosine was a kind gift from Bioresearch Co. (Milan, Italy). All other chemicals were from Sigma. The experiments were performed on the C2C12 mouse muscle cell line (58Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) and on the clone C2T18; the latter was selected because of its enhanced differentiative ability as described previously (59Scarpa S. Uhlendorf B.W. Cantoni G.L. Cell Differ. 1985; 17: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (see “Results”). Cells were cultured in F-14 medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml neomycin and 10% fetal calf serum, which favors cell growth, with only a limited amount of differentiation (growth medium with 10% fetal calf serum (GM)) or with 1% fetal calf serum (differentiation medium with 1% fetal calf serum (DM)), which induces differentiation with the appearance of myotubes and of creatine kinase (CK) activity after a limited number of cell divisions (59Scarpa S. Uhlendorf B.W. Cantoni G.L. Cell Differ. 1985; 17: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the differentiation experiments, flasks and multiwells were coated with 0.2% gelatin. 24 h after plating, the cells were either shifted to DM or re-fed with GM according to the experimental design; the time at which this medium shift occurred was indicated as day 0. The demethylating drugs 3 μm 3-deaza-adenosine and 50 μm homocysteine (jointly indicated as DH) were added to DM according to the experimental design. Cultures were re-fed every 2nd day with the appropriate medium (with or without drugs). Cells to be used for the enzymatic test, either in GM or DM, were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and frozen at −80 °C. After thawing, cells were scraped into 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol, sonified for 15 s in ice, and centrifuged. Supernatant was used for CK (EC 2.7.3.2) and total protein content assay (60Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The results, expressed as milliunits CK/μg protein ± S.E., are the average of at least three experiments. Spleen and brain tissues were isolated from adult mice; thigh skeletal muscle (quadriceps femoris) tissue was isolated from adult mice and from 17-day-old mouse embryos. Total RNA extraction was performed by the acidified phenol procedure (Ref. 61Stallcup M.R. Washington L.D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), was used as a probe for in vitro expression studies by Northern blotting. Blots were normalized with an 18 S ribosomal DNA mouse probe cloned in the pBR-322 plasmid (63Arnheim N. Kuehn M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 743-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled by random priming (64Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar, 65Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar) using the Megaprime DNA labeling system with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; specific activity >1.9 × 109 dpm/μg). Radioactive probes were purified by Centri-Sep columns. Agarose electrophoresis of total RNA, vacuum transfer on Hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cross-linking were performed according to standard procedures (62Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F Maniatis T Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 7.1-9.1Google Scholar). Each membrane was prehybridized in a hybridization oven at 42 °C by shaking for 2 h and by rolling for an additional 2 h in 10 ml of 50% Quick Hyb (Stratagene), 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). The radioactive probe was added to the prehybridization solution, and the membranes were incubated for 18–20 h at 42 °C in the same oven. Washes were performed with 50 ml of the following buffers: 2× SSC (20×, 175.3 g/liter NaCl, 88.2 g/liter sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS at room temperature; 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C twice; 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C twice. Autoradiographs were quantified using a computerized densitometer (BioImage, Genomic Solutions Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). The expression studies in biopsies in vivo were performed by RT-PCR. For this purpose, reverse transcription was performed on 1 μg of total RNA by using, in each 20-μl sample, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, and 300 μm each of dGTP, dATP, dCTP, and dTTP, 20 units of human placental ribonuclease inhibitor, 50 pmol of oligo(dT)16, and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by heat inactivation at 94 °C for 5 min. In the subsequent amplification reactions, 2 μl of each sample were mixed in a final volume of 50 μl that contained 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin, and 175 μm each of dGTP, dATP, dCTP, and dTTP, with 1 unit of Super Taq DNA polymerase and 20 pmol of each specific primer. For mouse myogenin (GenBankTM accession number M95800) and for mouse γ-actin(GenBankTM accession number L21996) genes, we performed 30 and 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 62 °C, 1.5 min at 72 °C, respectively, followed by 7 min at 72 °C, using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Thermal Cycler model 480. For the amplification of myogenin cDNA, we used MyoP3 (exon 1, 5′-TTCCTGTCCACCTTCAGGGCTTCG-3′, nt 1686–1709) as forward primer and MyoM2 (exon 3, 5′-TAAGGAGTCAGCTAAATTCCCTCGC-3′, nt 3507–3531) as backward primer, obtaining an amplified fragment of 808 bp. For the amplification of γ-actin cDNA, the forward primer used was MMGACTP3 (exon 5, 5′-ACCCAGGCATTGCTGACAGGATGC-3′, nt 2753–2776) and the backward primer was MMGACTM2 (exon 6, 5′-CCATCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACG-3′, nt 3046–3071); an amplified fragment of 216 bp was obtained. The amplified fragments were analyzed by standard electrophoretic procedures and ethidium bromide staining. The specificity of amplified products was assessed by restriction analysis and/or sequencing; γ-actin was used as an internal standard to ensure that the quantity of samples was always the same. Genomic DNA was extracted using a standard phenol/chloroform method followed by ethanol precipitation (62Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F Maniatis T Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 7.1-9.1Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was treated separately with the following restriction endonucleases: (i) EcoRI, which has no recognition sites within the amplified fragments of myogenin gene; (ii)HpaII, which has a recognition site within the 5′-flanking region and three recognition sites within exon 1 (Fig.1) and is methylation-sensitive (i.e. it fails to cut if the CCGG recognition sequence is methylated at any C). Exon 3, which possesses no HpaII orEcoRI recognition sites (Fig. 1), was used as an internal standard. In each case, 1.5 μg of genomic DNA were digested at 37 °C, first with 5 units of enzyme overnight and then with 3 more units for an additional 6 h, in a total volume of 40 μl of the buffer provided by the manufacturer. The following primers were used for the amplification of the mouse myogenin gene: for the 5′-flanking region, the forward primer MyoP1 5′-TGGAGTGGTCCTGATGTGGTAGTGG-3′ (nt 1022–1046) and the backward primer MyoM8 5′-ACCCAGAGATAAATATAGCCAACGC-3′ (nt 1496–1520); for exon 1, the forward primer MyoP3 (described above) and the backward primer MyoM7 5′-GCGCTCAATGTACTGGATGGCG-3′ (nt 1990–2011); for exon 3, the forward primer MyoP10 5′-TCCATCGTGGACAGCATCACG-3′ (nt 3266–3286) and the backward primer MyoM2 (described above). These pairs of primers were expected to produce, from uncut DNA, the following fragments: 499 bp for the 5′-flanking region, 326 bp for exon 1 and 266 bp for exon 3. PCR was performed, with 20 pmol of each primer, on 50 ng of DNA, in a total volume of 50 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin, and 175 μm dNTPs with 1 unit of SuperTaq. After an initial 3 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 62 °C, and 4.5 min at 72 °C) and a final extension of 7 min at 72 °C were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Thermal Cycler model 480. Aliquots of the PCR products (15 μl) were examined by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel. Each gel was scanned by a CCD camera and was acquired on the BioImage computerized densitometer. The specificity of the fragments was assessed by restriction analysis and/or sequencing. Table I shows the results of differentiation (measured as CK activity) of C2C12 and C2T18 cells. The C2C12 cells showed, after 96 h in GM, a low level of CK activity which, 96 h after the shift to DM, underwent a 7-fold increase. The C2T18 clone was characterized by higher CK activity in GM and a further increase after the shift to DM, thereby showing greater myogenic potentialities than C2C12. The presence of the drugs increased the degree of differentiation of both C2C12 and C2T18; the increase was greater in C2T18.Table IDifferentiation pattern of C2C12 and C2T18 cloneCellsCulture conditionsGMDMDM + DHC2C120.18 ± 0.021.28 ± 0.031.61 ± 0.11C2T180.69 ± 0.022.10 ± 0.055.60 ± 0.22The CK activity normalized for protein content (expressed as milliunits of CK/μg proteins ± S.E.), 96 h after induction, in cells cultured in GM, DM, or DM + DH, is shown.

In GM, C2C12 and C2T18 showed, at early times (48 h), a very low level ofmyogenin expression, which increased at later times (96 h) (Fig. 2, A and B,lanes 1 and 2). After the shift to DM,myogenin expression was enhanced both in C2C12 and C2T18 (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 3); the finalmyogenin expression was markedly higher in C2T18 than in C2C12 (Fig. 2 C). In DM,"

In this study, we determined whether the peroxidases of white blood cells can generate the interhalogen gas bromine chloride (BrCl). Myeloperoxidase, the heme enzyme secreted by activated neutrophils and monocytes, uses H2O2 and Cl− to produce HOCl, a chlorinating intermediate. In contrast, eosinophil peroxidase preferentially converts Br− to HOBr. Remarkably, both myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase were able to brominate deoxycytidine, a nucleoside, and uracil, a nucleobase, at plasma concentrations of Br− (100 μm) and Cl− (100 mm). The two enzymes used different reaction pathways, however. When HOCl brominated deoxycytidine, the reaction required Br− and was inhibited by taurine. In contrast, bromination by HOBr was independent of Br− and unaffected by taurine. Moreover, taurine inhibited 5-bromodeoxycytidine production by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl−- Br− system but not by the eosinophil peroxidase-H2O2-Cl−-Br−system, indicating that bromination by myeloperoxidase involves the initial production of HOCl. Both HOCl-Br− and the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl−-Br−system generated a gas that converted cyclohexene into 1-bromo-2-chlorocyclohexane, implicating BrCl in the reaction. Moreover, human neutrophils used myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and Br− to brominate deoxycytidine by a taurine-sensitive pathway, suggesting that transhalogenation reactions may be physiologically relevant. 5-Bromouracil incorporated into nuclear DNA is a well known mutagen. Our observations therefore raise the possibility that transhalogenation reactions initiated by phagocytes provide one pathway for mutagenesis and cytotoxicity at sites of inflammation.

More than 100 years ago, inorganic chemists proposed the existence of interhalogens, which are combinations of different halogens (XX n′). Both binary (BrCl, IBr, and ICl) and ternary (ICl3) interhalogens have since been characterized. One pathway for their formation requires hypohalous acid (HOX) and halide ion (X; Refs. 40Kumar K. Margerum D.W. Inorg. Chem. 1987; 26: 2706-2711Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar and 41Wang T.X. Kelley M.D. Cooper J.N. Beckwith R.C. Margerum D.W. Inorg.

Anions of interhalogens and polyhalides are also known; they include Cl 3−, Br 3−, I 3−, Br2Cl−, and BrCl 2−. Chemically, interhalogens are extremely corrosive species that attack a wide range of other compounds (42de la Mare P.B.D. Electrophilic Halogenation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1976Google Scholar). In the current studies, we show that myeloperoxidase generates reactive brominating species that oxidize nucleobases by a reaction involving HOCl, Br−, and formation of BrCl, an interhalogen gas. We also found that human neutrophils used myeloperoxidase, Cl−, and Br− to brominate deoxycytidine, suggesting that transhalogenation reactions may be physiologically relevant. Our observations suggest that transhalogenation reactions executed by phagocytes may represent one pathway for mutagenesis and cytotoxicity at sites of inflammation. Organic solvents, H2O2, sodium hypochlorite, and sodium phosphate were obtained from Fisher. Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and silylation grade acetonitrile were from Regis Technologies, Inc. (Morton Grove, IL). All other materials were purchased from Sigma, except where indicated. Myeloperoxidase (A 430/A 280 > 0.8) was isolated from HL-60 cells by sequential lectin affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatographies (43Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A.

The purity of myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase were assessed by peroxidase activity using nondenaturing polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and gel system 8 (46van Dalen C.J.

Glycerol (25% w/v) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (0.05% w/v) were included in all buffers. Riboflavin (0.024 mg/ml) was used as the polymerization catalyst, and the stacking gel was omitted. Peroxidase activity was visualized by incubating the gel in 400 μm tetramethylbenzidine, 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 5, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaBr, and 200 μm H2O2. Chloride-free NaOCl was prepared by a modification of previously described methods (16Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Reagent NaOCl (100 ml) mixed with ethyl acetate (100 ml) was protonated by dropwise addition of concentrated phosphoric acid (final pH ≤ 6) with intermittent shaking. The organic phase containing HOCl was washed twice with water, and HOCl was re-extracted into the aqueous phase by dropwise addition of NaOH (final pH ≥ 9). Residual ethyl acetate in the aqueous solution of chloride-free NaOCl was removed by bubbling with nitrogen gas. The concentration of NaOCl was determined spectrophotometrically (ε292 = 350 m−1cm−1; Ref. 48Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Taurine monochloramine was prepared by addition of HOCl to taurine (1:100; mol/mol). Taurine monochloramine concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ε252= 429 m−1 cm−1; Ref. 16Thomas E.L.

(1950) J. Chem. Soc., 564–573.Google Scholar). Briefly, silver nitrate solution was added to ∼80 mmbromine water in a molar ratio of 1.5:1. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and 30 ml of the supernatant was distilled under vacuum using a foil-covered microscale distillation apparatus. The distillate was collected in a foil covered vial at 4 °C. Reagent taurine monobromamine was prepared by addition of reagent HOBr to a 100-fold excess of taurine. HOBr concentration was determined spectrophotometrically following formation of taurine monobromamine (ε288 = 430 m−1cm−1; Ref. 35Thomas E.L. Bozeman P.M. Jefferson M.M. King C.C. J. Biol.

All reactions were performed in gas-tight vials and initiated by addition with a gas-tight syringe of oxidant (H2O2 or HOCl/OCl−) through a septum while vortexing the sample. Reactions were terminated by addition of l-methionine to a final concentration of 6 mm. The concentration of H2O2 was determined spectrophotometrically (ε240 = 43.6 m−1cm−1; Ref. 50Beers R.J. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH dependence of 5-bromouracil and 5-bromodeoxycytidine formation was performed using reaction mixtures containing phosphoric acid, monobasic sodium phosphate, and dibasic sodium phosphate (final concentration, 50 mm). The pH of the reaction mixture (which did not contain l-methionine) was determined at the end of the incubation. Neutrophils were prepared by density gradient centrifugation (51Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke H.L.R. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mg/ml dextrose, 1 mm deoxycytidine, 100 μm NaBr, and 100 μm DTPA,2 pH 5.9. Differential cell counts revealed that neutrophil preparations contained 96–100% neutrophils and 0–4% eosinophils. Cells (3 ml) were activated with 200 nm phorbol myristate acetate, incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, and maintained in suspension with intermittent inversion. The reaction was terminated by addition of methionine to 6 mm and centrifugation of the cells at 400 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was concentrated to dryness under vacuum, dissolved in 0.4 ml of HPLC solvent A, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to HPLC analysis. Uracil and deoxycytidine reaction products were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC with a C18 column (Beckman Porasil, 5 μm resin, 4.6 × 250 mm) at a flow of 1 ml/min and UV detection at 274 and 295 nm, respectively. Uracil reactions were analyzed by injection of 100 μl of reaction mixture onto the column followed by isocratic elution with 20 mm ammonium formate. For analysis of deoxycytidine reactions, 100 μl of the reaction mixture was injected onto the column and eluted with a gradient of: 95% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.5) and 5% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol, pH 2.5) for 4 min, 5–100% solvent B over 20 min, and then 100% solvent B for 10 min. 5-Bromouracil and 5-bromodeoxycytidine yields were quantified by comparison of integrated peak areas to standard curves generated using commercially available compounds. For mass spectrometric analysis, HPLC fractions were collected and concentrated under vacuum. For NMR analysis, 10-fold concentrated reaction mixtures were fractionated on a semi-preparative C18 column (μPorasil; 5 μm resin, 10 × 250 mm; Beckman) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min with an isocratic gradient consisting of 90% 20 mm ammonium formate, pH 6.3, and 10% methanol. N-Chlorodeoxycytidine (retention time, 10 min) was prepared as described (20Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and isolated with an analytical C18 column (μPorasil; 5 μm resin, 4.6 × 250 mm; Beckman) column using 5% methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Reaction products were isolated by HPLC, solubilized in D2O, and analyzed at 25 °C with a Varian Unity-Plus 500 spectrometer (499.843 MHz for 1H) equipped with a Nalorac indirect detection probe. 1H Chemical shifts were referenced to external sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d 4 in D2O. Spectra were recorded from 8 transients with a 12-s preacquisition delay over a spectral width of 8000 Hz. Pyrimidine resonances of the brominated deoxycytidine (8.23 ppm; singlet, H6) and uracil (7.79 ppm; singlet, H6) reaction products were essentially identical to those of commercially available 5-bromodeoxycytidine and 5-bromouracil. When compared with substrate, the aromatic region of each product spectrum was notable for the lack of proton resonances at C-5, a downfield shift in the proton resonance at C-6, and conversion of the C-6 proton resonance from a doublet to a singlet, both of which are consistent with substitution of a bromine atom at the C-5 position. After nucleobases were dried under vacuum, residual water was removed by forming an azeotrope with 50 μl of pyridine and again drying the suspension under vacuum. DNA bases were converted to trimethylsilyl derivatives with excessbis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + 1% trimethylchlorosilane in acetonitrile (3:1 v/v) at 100 °C for 60 min. Aliquots (1 μl) were analyzed in the positive electron ionization mode using full mass scanning on either a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (Santa Clarita, CA) interfaced with a Hewlett Packard 5972 Series Mass Selective Detector or a Varian Star 3400 CX gas chromatograph (Walnut Creek, CA) interfaced with a Finnegan SSQ 7000 mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA). Each gas chromatograph was equipped with a 12-m DB-1 capillary column (inner diameter, 0.2 mm; film thickness, 0.33 μm; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA). Injector and interface temperatures were 250 and 280 °C, respectively. The initial GC oven temperature was 70 °C for 2 min, followed by a 60 °C/min increase to 180 °C and a final 10 °C/min ramp to 220 °C. Derivatizing agent injections were analyzed between samples to ensure that no residual analyte remained in the injection port. Cyclohexene addition products (0.2 μl) were analyzed by selected ion monitoring of ions of m/z 195–201 using an initial GC temperature of 50 °C for 2 min, followed by a 20 °C/min increase to 100 °C and a final 60 °C/min ramp to 220 °C. Aliquots from HPLC fractions were analyzed on a Waters Alliance 2670 HPLC equipped with a C18 column (Porasil, 5 μm resin, 2.1 × 150 mm; Beckman) interfaced with a Finnigan LCQ. Sample (5 μl) was injected at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Solvent C was 1% acetic acid in 4% methanol, and solvent D was 1% acetic acid in 95% methanol. The sample was eluted from the column by a discontinuous gradient of solvent D. The gradient was: 0% solvent D for 2 min, 0–100% solvent D over 8 min, and then 100% for 10 min. Mass spectrometric analysis was carried out in full mass scanning, zoom scanning, and low energy collisionally activated dissociation modes as described (20Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Helium was used as a damping gas and collision activation partner. The temperature of the heated capillary was 220 °C. In the full scan mode (m/z 150–300), each scan consisted of three 300-ms microscans. Full scan mass spectra consisted of 10 signal-averaged scans with subtraction of the carrier solvent background from the same number of scans. The electrospray positive ion mass spectra of authentic 5-bromodeoxycytidine and the product from myeloperoxidase, HOCl + Br−, and HOBr yielded the same major [M + H]+ ion at m/z 306. All compounds also exhibited a prominent ion at m/z 308. The relative abundances of the ions at m/z 306 and 308 reflected that of the natural isotopic abundance of79Br and 81Br, strongly suggesting that the deoxycytidine oxidation product was monobrominated. The collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectrum of them/z 306 ion generated a product ion atm/z 190, which is consistent with cleavage of theN-glycoside bond of 5-bromodeoxycytidine to yield79Br-substituted cytosine. The collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectrum of the m/z 308 ion likewise generated a product ion at m/z 192, consistent with cleavage of the brominated nucleoside to yield81Br-substituted cytosine. The electrospray ionization MS/MS spectrum of the myeloperoxidase product indicates that the bromine substitution site resides on the cytosine base of deoxycytidine. Further structural characterization of the modified nucleobase generated from deoxycytidine and uracil was achieved using GC/MS to obtain an informative electron ionization mass spectrum and GC retention time from material isolated by HPLC. This procedure yields information only about the deoxycytidine nucleobase because theN-glycoside bond of the nucleoside is hydrolyzed during the derivatization reactions. The mass spectrum of the reaction products exhibited low abundance ions consistent with the molecular ion [M+·] of the bis-trimethylsilyl derivatives (m/z 333 and 334 for brominated deoxycytidine and uracil, respectively). The major ion from each analyte was consistent with loss of CH3⋅ as expected for trimethylsilyl derivatives. The [M]⋅+ and [M-CH3⋅]+ ions exhibited prominent M+2 isotopes as expected for monobrominated compounds containing the natural 1:1 abundance of 79Br or 81Br. Ions observed for [M − Br−]+ and [M − CH3· − HBr]+ or [M − CH4 − Br−]+ fragments lacked the prominent M+2 fragments as expected for compounds that lack bromine. The positive ion mass spectra and GC retention times of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the reaction products were essentially identical to those obtained for commercially available 5-bromodeoxycytidine or 5-bromouracil. We previously demonstrated that the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system (containing 100 mm Cl−) oxidizes deoxycytidine to 5-chlorodeoxycytidine (20Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). When we supplemented this system with a plasma concentration of Br− (100 μm), HPLC analysis detected a peak of material that migrated with a retention time distinct from that of 5-chlorodeoxycytidine (Fig.1 A). The new oxidation product was isolated by HPLC and identified as 5-bromodeoxycytidine on the basis of its HPLC retention time, ultraviolet absorption spectrum, GC retention time and positive ion mass spectrum, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrum, and 1H NMR spectrum (see “Methods”). Under these reaction conditions, 5-bromodeoxycytidine was also the major product when eosinophil peroxidase or lactoperoxidase oxidized deoxycytidine. It was therefore important to determine whether our myeloperoxidase preparation was contaminated by other peroxidases, even though we isolated the enzyme from HL-60 cells, a promyelocytic cell line that is not known to express other peroxidases. Myeloperoxidase was apparently pure as assessed by its heme spectrum and by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Moreover, it yielded a single band of peroxidase activity that migrated with a retention time distinct from that of eosinophil peroxidase on nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. These observations indicate that the reactive intermediates that brominated deoxycytidine at plasma concentrations of Cl− and Br− resulted from the action of myeloperoxidase. To determine whether the enzyme can halogenate other pyrimidines, we incubated uracil with the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system. In the absence of added Br−, a new peak of material (retention time, 13.7 min) was detectable in the reaction mixture by HPLC analysis (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of 100 μm Br−, we observed a second peak (retention time, 18 min). We isolated both peaks of material by HPLC and determined their structures by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, GC, and positive ion mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR spectroscopy (see “Methods”). We identified the early and late eluting materials as 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil, respectively. Production of 5-bromouracil by myeloperoxidase was dependent on the concentration of Br− in the reaction mixture (Fig.2). Increasing [Br−] from 0 to 100 μm in the presence of 100 mmCl− reduced uracil chlorination but increased uracil bromination. The apparent K m values for Cl− and Br− binding by myeloperoxidase are 175 and 2 mm (46van Dalen C.J. Whitehouse M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), respectively, suggesting that the enzyme did not directly oxidize Br− to generate 5-bromouracil. The relative yields of the halogenated pyrimidines also differed; under optimal conditions, the yield of 5-bromouracil was 5-fold greater than that of 5-chlorouracil. We used HPLC to investigate the reaction requirements for generation of 5-bromodeoxycytidine by the myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase-H2O2-Cl−-Br−systems (Table I). Both systems required enzyme and H2O2 and were blocked by catalase, a scavenger of H2O2. The product yield of the reaction was nearly quantitative relative to H2O2. Omitting B"

All COX II sequences that have been described to date are single polypeptides encoded by one gene, normally in the mitochondrial genome. In both Polytomella sp. and C. reinhardtii, COX II is encoded by two nuclear genes that were named cox2a and cox2b. The cox2a gene encodes a protein, COX IIA, corresponding to the N-terminal half of a typical one-polypeptide COX II, and the cox2b gene encodes a protein, COX IIB, equivalent to the C-terminal half of the same subunit. We propose that these separate genes give rise to a heterodimeric COX II that results from the noncovalent assembly of the COX IIA and COX IIB polypeptides in cytochrome c oxidase of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Polytomellasp. (198.80, E. G. Pringsheim), from the Sammlung von Algenkulturen (Gottingen, Germany), was grown as previously described (15Gutiérrez-Cirlos E.B. Antaramian A. Vázquez-Acevedo M.

For tryptic digestion analysis, gels were stained with Amido Black, and the polypeptide of interest was excised from the gel. Polypeptides were isolated as previously described (15Gutiérrez-Cirlos E.B. Antaramian A. Vázquez-Acevedo M. Coria R. González-Halphen D. J. Biol.

Amino-terminal Edman degradation was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Sequencer at the Laboratoire de Microséquençage des Protéines, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. An 18.6-kDa polypeptide was isolated from polyacrylamide gels and subjected to tryptic and endolysin-C digestion and separation on DEAE-C14 and DEAE-C18 HPLC2 columns. Peaks eluted from the columns were subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. Total DNA and total RNA fromPolytomella sp. and C. reinhardtii were isolated as previously described (14Pérez-Martı́nez X. Vázquez-Acevedo M. Tolkunova E. Funes S. Claros M.G. Davidson E. King M.P. González-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30144-30152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PCR fragments were cloned into pMOS blue-T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or pGEM-T easy (Promega). cDNA was prepared from 1–2 μg of total RNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) or Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). All standard molecular biology techniques were as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Sequencing was carried out by the Kimmel Cancer Center DNA Sequencing Facility, Thomas Jefferson University, and at the Unidad de Biologı́a Molecular, Instituto de Fisiologı́a Celular, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. A genomicPolytomella sp. cox2b fragment was amplified by PCR using two degenerate primers: F1 (5′- CA(A/G) GA(C/T) AG(C/T) GC(C/T) AC(A/T) AG(C/T) CA(G/A) GC(C/T) CA(A/G) G-3′) based on internal sequence (QDSATSQAQA) of COX II, and B1 (5′-TG (G/A)TT (C/T)AA (A/G)CG (A/T)CC (A/T)GG (A/G)AT (A/G)GC (A/G)TC CAT-3′) based on the internal sequence MDAIPGRLNQ. The resulting 300-nt product was used to isolate genomic cox2b clones from a library ofPolytomella DNA PstI fragments of ∼2 kilobases in length in pBluescript. The cox2b cDNA sequence from Polytomella sp. was obtained by PCR and 5′-RACE (20Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) using primers based on the genomic sequence obtained above. A poly(dT) tail was added to the 5′ end of the cDNA with a terminal transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The forward primer was oligo(dT)/adapter primer: 5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′, and the reverse primer (B2) was 5′-AGCTGTTTAAGACCATGACTTC-3′. Acox2a cDNA fragment was amplified using the degenerate primers F2 (5′-GA(G/A) GC(T/C) CC(T/C) GT(T/C) GC(T/C) TGG CAG CT(T/G) GG-3′), based on the N-terminal protein sequence EAPVAWQLG, and B3 (5′-CCA (A/G)TA CCA CTG (A/G)TG (A/G/T)CC (A/G)AT (A/G)GC C-3′), based on the internal conserved sequence KAIGHQWYW. Nested PCR was done with degenerate primers F3 (5′-CAG GA(T/C) TC(T/C) GC(T/C) AC(T/C) TC(T/C) CAG GC(T/C) CAG G-3′), based on the N-terminal sequence of the protein QDSATSQAQA and B4 (5′-GA(A/G) TA(A/G) AG(A/G) AG(A/G) GC(A/G) AA(A/G)GA(A/G) GG-3′), based on the internal conserved sequence PSFALLYS. For 3′-end cDNA cloning, oligo(dT)/adapter primer and primer F4 (5′-TCCTCTACCACATCGCCACCC-3′) were used. For nested PCR, adapter (5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA-3′) and primer F5 (5′-ACTACACTAAGCAAGCTCTCCCTG-3′) were used. For 5′-RACE, primers B5 (5′-TCAGGGAGAGCTTGCTTAGTGTAG-3′), with oligo(dT)/adapter primer, and B6 (5′-TTGGTGGCGATGTGGTAGAGG-3′), with adapter for nested PCR, were used. Primers F6 (5′-AATGCTCGCCCAGCGTATC-3′) and B7 (5′-AAACCTTCACACACCCATAGGC-3′), derived from the 5′- and 3′-RACE products, were used to amplify the full-length cDNA of thecox2a gene. The genomic sequence of thePolytomella sp. cox2a gene was obtained by PCR amplification of total Polytomella sp. DNA with the same primers. The cDNAs for cox2a and cox2b were obtained by screening a C. reinhardtii cDNA library in λgt10 (21Franzén L.-G. Falk G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using the Polytomella sp. cox2a cDNA orcox2b genomic DNA as probes. A total of 17 positive clones were obtained from 5 × 104 plaque-forming units screened. PCR using two primers based on λgt10 sequences was used to identify the positive clones with the largest inserts. Phage DNA from these clones was isolated with the Qiagen Lambda mini kit. The 5′ end of the cox2a cDNA was completed by RACE using primers based on the cDNA sequence obtained. A bacterial artificial chromosome clone containingcox2b was obtained from a BAC genomic library from C. reinhardtii (22Lefebvre P.A. Silflow C.D. Genetics. 1999; 151: 9-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by Genome Systems using the C. reinhardtii cox2b cDNA obtained above. BAC DNA was sequenced directly using internal primers. Mitochondrial targeting sequences were analyzed using MitoProt II (23Claros M.G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 441-447PubMed Google Scholar, 24Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The same program was used to calculate the segments with high local hydrophobicity (<H>) in a distance comprising 13 to 17 residues. The mesoH was determined by scanning each sequence for a maximum average hydrophobicity measured in windows from 60 to 80 residues and averaging the values (24Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). More hydrophobicity scales were included to reduce the possibility of bias. Protein transmembrane stretches were predicted using the program TodPred II (25Claros M.G. von Heijne G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structure modeling was carried out using SWISS-MODEL (26Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences are in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM nucleotide sequence data base under the accession numbers AF305078 (Polytomella sp.cox2a cDNA), AF305079 (Polytomella sp.cox2b cDNA), AF305080 (C. reinhardtii cox2acDNA), AF305540 (C. reinhardtii cox2bcDNA), AF305541 (Polytomella sp. genomiccox2a), AF305542 (Polytomella sp. genomiccox2b), and AF305543 (C. reinhardtii genomiccox2b). An active cytochrome c oxidase fromPolytomella sp. was isolated as previously described (14Pérez-Martı́nez X. Vázquez-Acevedo M. Tolkunova E. Funes S. Claros M.G. Davidson E. King M.P. González-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30144-30152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The four largest polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 54.6, 29.6, 18.6, and 14.5 kDa were subjected to Edman degradation. The 54.6-kDa polypeptide, not susceptible to Edman degradation, was identified as subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase (COX I) since its mass was similar to that predicted for the mitochondrialcox1 gene sequence (54,781 Da (27Antaramian A. Coria R. Ramı́rez J. González-Halphen D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)). The 29.6-kDa polypeptide (N-terminal sequence: SSDAGHHLSPRERYLV) was previously identified as subunit III (14Pérez-Martı́nez X. Vázquez-Acevedo M. Tolkunova E. Funes S. Claros M.G. Davidson E. King M.P. González-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30144-30152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of the 14.5-kDa polypeptide, DANSSELVLEPTRKYKAGLATRELW, did not show similarity with any sequences in GenBankTM. The N-terminal sequence of the 18.6-kDa polypeptide, EAPVAWQLGFQDSATSQAQA, was similar to COX II from other species, allowing identification of this polypeptide as COX II. A second sequence, MDAIPGR(R/L)NQIWLTINREG, was obtained during the Edman degradation of the 18.6-kDa polypeptide region at a yield of less than 50% that of the yield of the first sequence. This sequence also was similar to COX II from other species and was identified as an internal fragment of COX II that was obtained after partial cleavage of the protein during Edman degradation. On the basis of the primary amino acid sequences obtained for COX II, two degenerate oligodeoxynucleotide primers were designed. Using these primers, a PCR amplification product of 300 nt was obtained using total DNA from Polytomella sp. as a template. This PCR product encoded the C-terminal portion of thecox2 gene but lacked the region that encodes the N-terminal sequence of COX II. The absence of an N-terminal sequence was attributed to nonspecific annealing of the primer based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The 300-nt cox2 gene fragment hybridized to a 2-kilobasePstI fragment of Polytomella sp. total DNA in Southern analyses. To obtain a full-length gene, a mini-library was constructed from PstI fragments of ∼2 kilobases, and a positive clone was isolated and sequenced. This genomic sequence contained a 462-nt open reading frame that encoded a 153-amino acid protein homologous to the C terminus of COX II. The gene was namedcox2b. There was no open reading frame corresponding to the N-terminal portion of COX II in the 960 nt preceding the 462-nt open reading frame. Using primers based on the genomic sequence, a portion of a cDNA corresponding to the cox2b open reading frame was amplified from Polytomella sp. total RNA using reverse transcription-PCR. The remainder of the 5′-cDNA sequence was obtained by 5′-RACE. The full-length cDNA obtained contained a 65-nt 5′-untranslated region and a 462-nt open reading frame identical to that of the genomic clone. This showed that this gene encoded only the C-terminal portion of COX II and did not contain introns. The overall organization of the cox2b gene is shown in Fig.1. The predicted protein contained the MDAIPGRLNQIWLTINREG internal sequence that was obtained from direct protein sequencing as well as the sequence GQCSEICG known to be the COX II binding site for binuclear copper (28Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). The major N-terminal sequence of COX II, determined by Edman degradation, was not present in the deduced protein sequence. The N-terminal 43 amino acids lacked homology to any COX II proteins. The remaining sequence was homologous with the C-terminal half of many COX II proteins. The highest similarity was with COX II from the alga Prototheca wickerhamii (29Wolff G. Plante I. Lang B.F. Kück U. Burger G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggested that thecox2 gene had been split into two genes inPolytomella sp. The PCR amplification product of the cox2b gene ofPolytomella sp. was also used to isolate a cox2bcDNA from a λgt10 cDNA library of C. reinhardtii. A comparison of this cox2b cDNA with the genomic sequence (see below) showed that this cox2b cDNA sequence lacked the first four codons of the cox2b gene and a 5′-untranslated region. It exhibited 85% identity with thePolytomella sp. cox2b (Fig.2). The cox2b cDNA fromC. reinhardtii was used to isolate cox2b from aC. reinhardtii BAC genomic library. The genomiccox2b sequence contained the complete coding region and was identical to the cDNA except for the presence of one intron of 187 nt, located 21 nucleotides upstream of the stop codon. There was no open reading frame encoding a known protein in the 1.7 kilobases preceding the start codon for the C. reinhardtii cox2b gene. The predicted COX IIB protein was 153 amino acids long and was 85% identical and 92% similar to COX IIB of Polytomella sp. Both C. reinhardtii and Polytomella sp. are therefore likely to use two genes to code for COX II. To clone the gene that encoded the N-terminal region of COX II, nested PCR was performed with primers derived from the major N-terminal sequence obtained from the protein, and internal sequences (KAIGHQWYW and PSFALLYS) were conserved among COX II proteins. UsingPolytomella sp. cDNA as a template, a 250-nt PCR product was obtained that exhibited similarity with other cox2genes. The full-length cDNA, obtained using 5′- and 3′-RACE (Fig.1), contained an open reading frame of 816 nt predicted to encode a protein of 271 amino acids including the sequence EAPVAWQLGF determined for the N terminus of the 18.6-kDa polypeptide. This gene was namedcox2a, since it encoded the N-terminal portion of the COX II protein (COX IIA). The N terminus of the mature Polytomella sp. COX IIA protein, derived from direct sequencing, corresponded to Glu-131 of the predicted sequence, indicating that this protein contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence of 130 amino acids. The mature protein is predicted to be 141 amino acids long and to contain two putative transmembrane stretches, from Ile-28 to Thr-48 and from Val-69 to Leu-89, and the highly conserved sequence GRQWYWSY present in all sequences of COX II subunits known to date (Fig. 2). The sequence from Glu-131 to Glu-246 was homologous with the N-terminal portion of many COX II proteins. This sequence was most similar to COX II from the algaP. wickerhamii. The COX IIA protein contained a C-terminal 20-amino acid region, lacking similarity to conventional COX II proteins, that had a high density of charged amino acids. Primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the cox2acDNA sequence of Polytomella sp. were used to amplify a portion of the cox2a nuclear gene from total DNA. This 1773-nt PCR product was cloned and sequenced. The genomiccox2a gene contained 6 introns, ranging in size from 84 to 136 nt. The Polytomella sp. cox2a cDNA was used to isolate a partial cDNA clone of cox2a from a C. reinhardtii cDNA library. The complete sequence of C. reinhardtii cox2a was obtained by 5′-RACE (Fig. 1). The C. reinhardtii cox2a cDNA contained a 5′- untranslated region of 30 nt, an open reading frame of 855 nt, encoding a protein of 284 amino acids, and a 3′-untranslated region of 201 nt. The predicted C. reinhardtii COX IIA mature polypeptide exhibited 72% identity and 81% similarity with the sequence predicted for the COX IIA protein from Polytomella sp. (Fig. 2). The gene sequence predicts an extension of 21 residues at the C-terminal end that lacked homology to COX II proteins but that was highly similar to the extension predicted by the cox2a gene from Polytomella sp. The nuclear location of bothcox2a and cox2b was confirmed by Southern analysis. After electrophoresis of Polytomella sp. total DNA through agarose gels, the mtDNA was detected as a discrete band below the bulk of the nuclear DNA (Fig.3 A, left panel). This was confirmed with a cox1 gene probe (27Antaramian A. Coria R. Ramı́rez J. González-Halphen D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that hybridized with the mtDNA and a β-tubulin gene probe (30Conner T.W. Thompson M.D. Silflow C. Gene. 1989; 84: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) that hybridized with the nuclear DNA (Fig. 3 A, left panel). The cox2a and cox2b genes ofPolytomella sp. hybridized with the major DNA fraction and not with the mtDNA band, confirming their nuclear localization. A similar analysis was carried out with total DNA from C. reinhardtii using a cox1 gene probe that hybridized with the mtDNA (31Gray M.W. Boer P.H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1988; 319: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and a cytochrome c gene probe (32Amati B.B. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Wallace C.J. Rochaix J.D. J. Mol. Evol. 1988; 28: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that hybridized with the nuclear DNA (Fig. 3 A, left panel). Those results confirmed that the cox2a andcox2b genes were also nuclear-encoded in C. reinhardtii. To determine whether cox2a and cox2b were present as single-copy genes in the genomes of Polytomella sp. andC. reinhardtii, additional Southern blot analyses were performed. Single hybridization bands were obtained for thecox2a and cox2b genes of Polytomellasp. and C. reinhardtii with several restriction enzymes (Fig. 3, panel B and data not shown). This suggested that both genes were present in only one copy in their respective genomes. The expression of cox2a and cox2b ofPolytomella sp. and C. reinhardtii was examined by Northern analyses. Probes derived from the cox2a andcox2b genes hybridized to independent transcripts of sizes consistent with the corresponding cDNA sequences for both algae (Fig. 3, panel C). The presence of a larger, mature transcript that could suggest a transpliced product was not observed in any case. The cox2b gene of Polytomella sp. exhibited a double band. Since the genomic sequence of thiscox2b gene contained three putative polyadenylation sites in the 3′-noncoding region, it is possible that these bands correspond to mRNAs that have different sites of polyadenylation. There is a significant bias in codon usage in these genera of algae (30Conner T.W. Thompson M.D. Silflow C. Gene. 1989; 84: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and this bias differs between mitochondrial and nuclear genes (14Pérez-Martı́nez X. Vázquez-Acevedo M. Tolkunova E. Funes S. Claros M.G. Davidson E. King M.P. González-Halphen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30144-30152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Analysis of the codon usage for the cox2a andcox2b genes of Polytomella sp. and C. reinhardtii indicated that the codon usage was consistent with their nuclear localization (data not shown). In addition, the conserved polyadenylation signals TGTAA (33Silflow C. Rochaix J.-D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 25-40Google Scholar), present in the vast majority of nuclear genes in the Chlamydomonad family, were present at the 3′ ends of the cDNA sequences of cox2a and cox2b for both algae. Since the primary protein sequences derived from the 18.6-kDa region of a polyacrylamide gel corresponded to the predicted amino acid sequences of both COX IIA and COX IIB fromPolytomella sp., it is likely that this region of the gel contained both subunits. To confirm that Polytomella sp. contained two independent COX II polypeptides, the purified cytochromec oxidase complex of this alga was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis. The complex contained two major polypeptides in the expected mass range for COX IIA and COX IIB, one of 15,984 Da (theoretical 16,222 Da for mature COX IIA) and one of 17,169 Da (theoretical 17,219 Da for full-length COX IIB). The differences between the predicted and observed masses are likely due to post-translational modifications of the proteins. The 17,169-Da polypeptide was isolated by reverse phase-HPLC, trypsinized, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis. The trypsin digestion products exhibited molecular masses that were consistent with the theoretical molecular masses expected for COX IIB peptides (TableI).Table IMass spectrometry analysis of the tryptic fragments obtained from the COX IIB subunit of Polytomella spSequence of the tryptic peptideTheoretical molecular massExperimental molecular massDaDaAFLTEYVK970.12970.448LVLPTNTLVR1125.371125.649LNQIWLTINR1270.481270.702LLVTASDV…AVPSLGIK2106.472123.172VPASQPIQ…DVQPGQLR2854.182854.383EGVFYGQC…VVEAISPR3141.563140.432The experimental values were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digestion fragments of COX IIB purified by reverse transcription-HPLC from isolated cytochrome c oxidase.

https://openalex.org/W2090847189,"Biochemical studies of flavohemoglobin (Hmp) from Escherichia coli suggest that instead of aerobic oxygen delivery, a dioxygenase converts NO to NO 3− and anaerobically, an NO reductase converts NO to N2O. To investigate the structural features underlying the chemical reactivity of Hmp, we have measured the resonance Raman spectra of the ligand-free ferric and ferrous protein and the CO derivatives of the ferrous protein. At neutral pH, the ferric protein has a five-coordinate high-spin heme, similar to peroxidases. In the ferrous protein, a strong iron-histidine stretching mode is present at 244 cm−1. This frequency is much higher than that of any other globin discovered to date, although it is comparable to those of peroxidases, suggesting that the proximal histidine has imidazolate character. In the CO derivative, an open and a closed conformation were detected. The distal environment of the closed conformation is very polar, where the heme-bound CO strongly interacts with the B10 Tyr and/or the E7 Gln. These data demonstrate that the active site structure of Hmp is very similar to that of peroxidases and is tailored to perform oxygen chemistry.

E. coli flavohemoglobin hemoglobin myoglobin cytochrome c peroxidase Hemoglobin genes have been discovered in organisms from virtually all biological kingdoms. The presence of hemoglobins in unicellular organisms suggests that the gene for hemoglobin is very ancient and that the hemoglobins must have functions other than oxygen transport in view of the fact that O2 delivery in unicellular organisms is a diffusion-controlled process. Based on sequence alignments, two groups of hemoglobins have been identified in several pathogenic and nonpathogenic unicellular organisms (1Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first group consists of small hemoglobins with a novel two-over-two α-helical sandwich motif. These have been termed truncated hemoglobins and are characterized by the absence of the A-helix and the presence of an extended loop substituting for most of the F-helix (1Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second group consists of flavohemoglobins from bacteria and fungi. These consist of a hemoglobin domain with a classical three-over-three α-helical sandwich motif and a flavin-containing reductase domain that is either covalently or noncovalently associated with the hemoglobin domain (2Ermler U.

Despite the large differences in the tertiary structures, all the hemoglobins from unicellular organisms discovered to date contain a histidine at the F8 position that coordinates to the heme iron, and a tyrosine at the B10 position in the distal pocket. The distal E7 position, which is occupied by a histidine in mammalian Hbs, is occupied by a variety of different polar or nonpolar residues. Single-chain flavohemoglobins are found in a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms (2Ermler U. Siddiqui R.A. Cramm R. Friedrich B.

The E. coli flavohemoglobin (Hmp),1 with a molecular mass of 44 kDa, was the first single-chain flavohemoglobin to be cloned and sequenced (8Vasudevan S.G. Armarego W.L. Shaw D.C. Lilley P.E. Dixon N.E. Poole R.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic studies showed that Hmp is an oxygen-binding hemoglobin with a histidine as the proximal heme ligand (19Ioannidis N. Cooper C.E. Poole R.K. Biochem.

Fe+2–O–O+⋅N=O→[Fe+3–OONO−]→Fe+3+NO3− REACTION1In this reaction, the heme-bound peroxynitrite, Fe+3–OONO−, is a proposed reaction intermediate. Based on kinetic studies, the apparent bimolecular rate of the NO reaction with oxy-Hmp is 40–70 times faster than those for mammalian globins, which makes it almost as efficient as the diffusion-controlled reaction of NO with free O⨪2 (20Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12581-12589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of Hmp with other hemoglobins suggests that the proximal ligand to the heme is histidine, and the distal residues at the E7 and B10 positions are glutamine and tyrosine, respectively (2Ermler U. Siddiqui R.A. Cramm R. Friedrich B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6067-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although the exact arrangement of these distal residues surrounding the ligand binding site in Hmp is not clear, it is plausible that the distal pocket is large and flexible (2Ermler U. Siddiqui R.A.

Biochem. 1999; 262: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of Alcaligenes (Ralstonia) Hb (the only available crystal structure for flavohemoglobins). We postulate that the large and flexible distal pocket evolved to accommodate both O2 and NO molecules simultaneously for performing O2/NO chemistry. Hmp binds O2 strongly with aK d of ∼11.5 nm (20Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Gardner P.R. Dou Y. Olson J.S. J. Biol.

A similar role of the B10 Tyr residue has been found in several nonvertebrate hemoglobins, such as those fromMycobacterium tuberculosis (22Yeh S.R. Couture M. Ouellet Y. Guertin M. Rousseau D.L. J.

In this work, resonance Raman spectroscopy was employed to reveal the structural features of Hmp that underlie its chemical reactivity. Hmp was cloned, expressed, and purified to near homogeneity as described elsewhere (28Mills C.E. Sedelnikova S. Søballe B. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein was buffered at the desired pH with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. For all of the experiments reported here, the protein concentration was 40 μM. The Raman measurements were made with previously described instrumentation (22Yeh S.R. Couture M. Ouellet Y. Guertin M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1679-1684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The output at 406.7 and 413.1 nm from a krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics), for the measurements of the ferric and the ferrous derivatives, respectively, were focused to a ∼30-μm spot (laser power ∼ 2 milliwatts) on a rotating cell to prevent photodamage to the sample. The acquisition time was about 20–30 min for each spectrum. The scattered light was collected at right angles to the incident beam and focused on the entrance slit of a 1.25-m polychromator (Spex) where it was dispersed and then detected by a charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments). Resonance Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be extremely informative in probing active site structures of heme proteins (22Yeh S.R. Couture M. Ouellet Y. Guertin M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol.

In the low frequency region of the spectrum between 200 and 800 cm−1, the specific axial ligands coordinated to the prosthetic heme group can be identified by detecting iron-ligand stretching modes. In the high frequency region of the spectrum between 1300 to 1700 cm−1, the oxidation state, spin state, and the axial coordination state of the iron at the center of the heme can be characterized. In particular, the ν2 mode, in the region between 1550 and 1600 cm−1, is sensitive to the iron spin state. The line in the 1475–1520 cm−1 region, assigned as the ν3 mode, is sensitive to both the axial coordination and spin state of the iron. The strong line between 1350 and 1400 cm−1, assigned as the ν4 mode, is sensitive to the π-electron density of the porphyrin macrocycle and therefore the oxidation state of the iron. The frequency and intensity of these Raman lines are further modulated by the protein environment surrounding the heme and, therefore, provide useful structural information on heme proteins. The high frequency resonance Raman spectrum of the ferrous deoxy form of Hmp is shown in Fig. 1. The electron density marker line, ν4, is located at 1353 cm−1 and the spin/coordination sensitive line, ν3, is located at 1470 cm−1. The spectrum is characteristic of a ferrous five-coordinate heme protein. In the low frequency region (Fig. 2), a very strong line at 244 cm−1 is present that we attribute to an iron-histidine stretching mode. The presence of this mode is consistent with the assignment of the ferrous form being five-coordinate high-spin with histidine as the proximal ligand. In general, the Fe–His stretching frequency of globins, which have a neutral histidine as the proximal ligand, is in the range of 200–230 cm−1(31Argade P.V. Sassaroli M. Rousseau D.L. Inubushi T.

Salmeen I. Babcock G.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981; 103: 5981-5982Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the other hand, that of the peroxidases, which have an imidazolate ligand, is much higher in the range of 240–260 cm−1 (32Smulevich G. Hu S. Rodgers K.R. Goodin D.B. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. Biospectroscopy. 1996; 2: 365-376Crossref Google Scholar, 35Dasgupta S. Rousseau D.L. Anni H. Yonetani T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 654-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kitagawa T. Ondrias M.R. Rousseau D.L. Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. Nature. 1982; 298: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the stretching frequency of 244 cm−1 suggests that the proximal ligand of Hmp has imidazolate character. This conclusion is consistent with the crystallographic data of another flavohemoglobin fromAlcaligenes eutrophus, which has high sequence homology with Hmp. This hemoglobin has a Fe-His-Glu grouping on the proximal side of the heme (2Ermler U. Siddiqui R.A. Cramm R. Friedrich B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6067-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), that resembles the catalytic triad (Fe-His-Asp) observed in cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) (37Goodin D.B. McRee D.E.

Science. 1988; 240: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The heme iron of the ferric protein is five-coordinate high-spin at neutral pH, as indicated by the ν3 and ν2lines located at 1491 and 1570 cm−1, respectively, in the resonance Raman spectrum (Fig. 1). These data suggests that the distal binding site of heme is unoccupied. The distal binding site in most ferric globins is occupied by a water molecule at neutral pH, and as a result, the electronic configuration of the heme iron is normally a six-coordinate high-spin and low-spin mixture (38Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Paoli M. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4577-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The absence of a water bound to the heme in the distal site is consistent with the presence of a CCP-like proximal imidazolate ligand for the heme. It has been shown in peroxidases that the imidazolate character of the proximal histidine leads to a strong Fe–His bond. The strong Fe–His bond forces the iron to move out of the porphyrin plane and thereby prevents the coordination of weak distal ligands to the heme (39Smulevich G. Biospectroscopy. 1998; 4: S3-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Anni H. Yonetani T. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 274: 437-449PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yonetani T. Anni H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9547-9554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ferric protein in most peroxidases thus favors a five-coordinate structure. When the Asp that forms a hydrogen bond with the proximal His in CCP is mutated, the ferrous state exhibits a much lower Fe–His stretching frequency, and the ferric state is converted from a five-coordinate to a six-coordinate structure (39Smulevich G. Biospectroscopy. 1998; 4: S3-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Hmp has a similar hydrogen bonding network on the proximal side of the heme as peroxidases, and it contains a strong Fe–His bond as indicated by the high Fe–His stretching frequency, the five-coordinate structure of the ferric state is attributed to the same origin. In the high frequency region of the resonance Raman spectrum of the CO-coordinated protein, ν4 is located at 1373 cm−1 and ν3 and ν2 are located at 1498 and 1582 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 1). The spectrum is characteristic of a ferrous six-coordinate heme protein. In the low frequency region, two isotope sensitive lines, located at 494 and 535 cm−1, were observed that are shifted to 478 and 516 cm−1, respectively, in the 13C18O derivative (Fig. 2). These two Fe–CO modes are associated with two C–O stretching modes at 1907 and 1960 cm−1, respectively, in the 12C16O derivative that are shifted to 1825 and 1868 cm−1, respectively, in the13C18O derivative (Fig.4). There is a well established inverse correlation curve linking the Fe–CO stretching frequencies with the associated C–O stretching frequencies (42Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 2000; 297: 11-17Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 43Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 6024-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 44Ray G.B. Li X.Y. Ibers J.A. Sessler J.L. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 162-176Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar). This correlation is attributed to back-donation of Fe2+ dπelectrons to the CO π* orbitals. When CO is coordinated to a ferrous heme iron, the ς bond formed by donation of electrons from CO to the iron greatly increases the electron density on the iron. A partial double bond resonance (i.e. “back bonding” from iron dπ electrons to the CO π* orbitals) is used to decrease the rich electron density added to the iron to stabilize the L-M-CO complex (M and L stand for the ferrous heme iron and the proximal heme ligand, respectively) as is shown in Reaction 2. L–M−–C≡O+↔L–M=C=O(I)(II) REACTION2The degree of back-donation from CO to the iron depends on the polarity of the distal environment surrounding the heme-bound CO. A positive distal interaction that destabilizes form I thus strengthens the M–CO bond and concomitantly weakens the C–O bond. This inverse correlation has been successfully used to link the Fe–CO and CO frequencies of many heme-containing proteins and model compounds including globins and peroxidases (42Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 2000; 297: 11-17Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In wild-type myoglobin, the νFe–CO and νC–O frequencies are located at 508 and 1945 cm−1, respectively. As the distal histidine is mutated to various nonpolar residues, νFe–CO becomes lower and νC–O becomes higher as shown in Fig. 5. Similar trends were observed in horse radish peroxidase and CCP (Fig. 5 and Ref. 45Feis A. Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Thorneley R.N.F. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13575-13581Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This inverse correlation also depends on the identity of the proximal ligand such that the line for histidine is distinct from that of thiolate and that of five coordinate species as shown in Fig. 5 (42Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 2000; 297: 11-17Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although peroxidases with an imidazolate and globins with a neutral imidazole as the proximal ligands fall on the same line, in general the data from peroxidases are located at the upper left corner of the correlation line with respect to globins because the distal environments of the former are more polar than the latter (Fig. 5).Figure 5The inverse correlation diagram of the Fe–CO stretching frequency versus the C–O stretching frequency of a variety of heme proteins and porphyrin derivatives adapted from Refs. 42Vogel K.M.

The modes located at 535 and 1907 cm−1 are similar to those reported in peroxidases and are thus assigned as originating from a closed conformation in which the distal residues strongly interact with the CO. The modes located at 494 and 1960 cm−1 are similar to mammalian globins (38Feis A. Marzocchi M.P. Paoli M. Smulevich G.

Chem. 1985; 260: 8372-8377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are assigned as an open conformation without any strong positive polar interactions between the distal environment and the CO. The relative population of the open and closed conformation is highly pH-dependent. The intensity ratio of the 494/535 cm−1 lines decreases as the pH decreases. A pK a of 8.3 is obtained by plotting the ratio ofI 494/(I 494+I 535) as a function of pH (Fig. 6), whereI 494 and I 535 are the intensities of the 494 and 535 cm−1 modes, respectively. Based on this observation, we attribute the positive polar interaction in the closed conformation to the hydrogen bonding with the hydroxide on the B10 Tyr and/or the amine group of the E7 Gln, and the observed pK a at 8.3 is attributed to the protonation/deprotonation of either one or both of these residues. It is widely accepted that the O–O bond activation in peroxidases is facilitated by a “push-pull” (37Goodin D.B. McRee D.E.

In this model, the presence of a strong hydrogen bond between the proximal histidine and an aspartate leads to partially anionic character in the proximal histidine that supplies a better electronic push for the heterolytic cleavage of the O–O bond (48Dawson J.H. Science. 1988; 240: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 49Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Poulos T.L. Adv.

On the other hand, the pull effect on the distal side of the heme is created by an arginine to polarize the O–O bond and a histidine functioning as an acid/base catalyst in proton transfer during the catalytic cycle. Although recent new evidence suggests that the push effect from the proximal side of the heme is not required for some peroxidase activity (50Poulos T.L. Adv. Inorg.

Genistein has been reported to have a wide range of biological activities and to play a role in the diminished incidence of breast cancer in populations that consume a soy-rich diet. Genistein was originally identified as an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases; however, it also inhibits topoisomerase II by stabilizing the covalent DNA cleavage complex, an event predicted to cause DNA damage. The topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide acts in a similar manner. Here we show that genistein induces the up-regulation of p53 protein, phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15, activation of the sequence-specific DNA binding properties of p53, and phosphorylation of the hCds1/Chk2 protein kinase at threonine 68. Phosphorylation and activation of p53 and phosphorylation of Chk2 were not observed in ATM-deficient cells. In contrast, the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide induced phosphorylation of p53 and Chk2 in ATM-positive and ATM-deficient cells. In addition, genistein-treated ATM-deficient cells were significantly more susceptible to genistein-induced killing than were ATM-positive cells. Together our data suggest that ATM is required for activation of a DNA damage-induced pathway that activates p53 and Chk2 in response to genistein.

ATM is therefore a key player in signaling DNA damage to cell cycle checkpoints.Because etoposide and genistein have both been reported to induce apoptosis by initiating topoisomerase II-induced DNA damage, we were interested to determine whether they activated an ATM-dependent pathway. Indeed, genistein has been shown to induce up-regulation of p53 protein levels in ATM-positive cells (36Khanna K.K Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3307-3312PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that treatment of ATM-positive cells with genistein activates the DNA-binding function of p53, induces phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15, and induces phosphorylation of Chk2 at threonine 68. Genistein did not induce activation of p53 or phosphorylation of Chk2 in two ATM-deficient human cell lines, suggesting that genistein activates a pathway that requires ATM or is mediated by ATM. Moreover, we show that the topoisomerase inhibitor, etoposide, but not the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A, also induces phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and phosphorylation of Chk2, supporting the idea that genistein induces DNA damage that is recognized by an ATM-dependent pathway. In contrast, etoposide induced phosphorylation of both p53 and Chk2 in ATM-deficient cells as well as in normal cells, suggesting that etoposide activates protein kinases other than ATM in vivo.DISCUSSIONGenistein belongs to a family of naturally occurring phytoestrogens that includes quercetin, biochanin A, kaempferol, and daidzein. These compounds have been reported to have a wide variety of biological functions, including both growth promoting and anti-tumorigenic effects. Genistein, in particular, has been reported to have a plethora of biological activities, including inhibition of tyrosine kinases, inhibition of topoisomerase II, anti-proliferative effects in breast cancer cells, induction of growth arrest, and apoptosis. Here we show that genistein induces ATM-dependent up-regulation of p53, phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15, and activation of the sequence specific DNA binding properties and transcriptional activation of p53. These and previous data (36Khanna K.K Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3307-3312PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that genistein signals via ATM to p53 at the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint.Genistein also induced reduced mobility of Chk2 protein on Western blot. The reduced mobility of Chk2 was indistinguishable from that induced by exposure to ionizing radiation, an event that has previously been shown to be due to phosphorylation. Moreover, we show that, like ionizing radiation, genistein induces phosphorylation of Chk2 on threonine 68. Significantly, genistein-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 was completely absent in two lymphoblastoid A-T cell lines, suggesting that ATM is absolutely required for genistein-induced signaling through Chk2. Also, our data show that cells containing ATM display increased cell survival in the presence of genistein. We speculate that genistein may activate an ATM-dependent DNA damage response pathway that protects cells from induced DNA damage.Recently, Darbon and colleagues (51Darbon J-M. Penary M. Escalas N.

In our study, wortmannin reduced phosphorylation of serine 15 of p53 and completely abrogated phosphorylation of Chk2. Moreover, we show that in two separate pairs of lymphoblastoid cell lines, the effects of genistein on p53 and Chk2 are dependent on the presence of ATM. We speculate that these differences may be due to the different types of cell lines used in the two studies.Although genistein is known to inhibit tyrosine kinases, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A did not induce phosphorylation of Chk2 or p53, suggesting that genistein is acting via a topoisomerase-dependent DNA damage response pathway rather than via inhibition of a tyrosine kinase. Genistein and etoposide have both been reported to induce DNA damage via stabilization of the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage intermediate. Although both agents induce phosphorylation of p53 and Chk2, our results show that only genistein activates an ATM-dependent pathway and suggest that etoposide is activating a different DNA damage response pathway than genistein, that is not mediated by ATM. This suggests that other protein kinases that phosphorylate p53 (at serine 15) and Chk2 at threonine 68 and possibly other sites, must be activated by etoposide treatment. Possible candidates include the related protein DNA-PK, which phosphorylates threonine 68 of Chk2 and serine 15 of p53 in vitro (Refs. 35Chan D.W Son S-C. Block W. Ye R. Douglas P. Goodarzi A.A.

Genistein did not induce DNA fragmentation in BT, L3, or HL60 cell lines used in this study. Similarly, genistein was only weakly effective in causing DNA damage in melanoma cells, as measured by the single cell alkaline electrophoresis (Comet) assay (51Darbon J-M. Penary M. Escalas N.

However, these results do not preclude the possibility that genistein induces a subtle form of DNA damage that was not efficiently detected by either assay method.Although genistein and etoposide both inhibit topoisomerase II,in vitro studies indicate that genistein and etoposide induce different types of DNA damage and that genistein but not etoposide also induces protein-DNA cross-links (9Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Pierre J. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that ATM is required for repair of some types of DNA damage, breaks, or cross-links but not others. Another possibility is that the combined effects of genistein on tyrosine kinases and topoisomerase II selects for or causes a specific type of lesion, the repair of which requires ATM. Interestingly, the protein-tyrosine kinase, c-Abl, has been shown to interact with ATM and to play a role in signaling of DNA damage (54Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T.

Another characteristic of A-T cells is failure to arrest at G2/M following exposure to ionizing radiation (27Houndsworth J. Lavin M.F.

ATM is therefore a key player in signaling DNA damage to cell cycle checkpoints. Because etoposide and genistein have both been reported to induce apoptosis by initiating topoisomerase II-induced DNA damage, we were interested to determine whether they activated an ATM-dependent pathway. Indeed, genistein has been shown to induce up-regulation of p53 protein levels in ATM-positive cells (36Khanna K.K Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3307-3312PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that treatment of ATM-positive cells with genistein activates the DNA-binding function of p53, induces phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15, and induces phosphorylation of Chk2 at threonine 68. Genistein did not induce activation of p53 or phosphorylation of Chk2 in two ATM-deficient human cell lines, suggesting that genistein activates a pathway that requires ATM or is mediated by ATM. Moreover, we show that the topoisomerase inhibitor, etoposide, but not the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A, also induces phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and phosphorylation of Chk2, supporting the idea that genistein induces DNA damage that is recognized by an ATM-dependent pathway. In contrast, etoposide induced phosphorylation of both p53 and Chk2 in ATM-deficient cells as well as in normal cells, suggesting that etoposide activates protein kinases other than ATM in vivo. DISCUSSIONGenistein belongs to a family of naturally occurring phytoestrogens that includes quercetin, biochanin A, kaempferol, and daidzein. These compounds have been reported to have a wide variety of biological functions, including both growth promoting and anti-tumorigenic effects. Genistein, in particular, has been reported to have a plethora of biological activities, including inhibition of tyrosine kinases, inhibition of topoisomerase II, anti-proliferative effects in breast cancer cells, induction of growth arrest, and apoptosis. Here we show that genistein induces ATM-dependent up-regulation of p53, phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15, and activation of the sequence specific DNA binding properties and transcriptional activation of p53. These and previous data (36Khanna K.K Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3307-3312PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that genistein signals via ATM to p53 at the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint.Genistein also induced reduced mobility of Chk2 protein on Western blot. The reduced mobility of Chk2 was indistinguishable from that induced by exposure to ionizing radiation, an event that has previously been shown to be due to phosphorylation. Moreover, we show that, like ionizing radiation, genistein induces phosphorylation of Chk2 on threonine 68. Significantly, genistein-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 was completely absent in two lymphoblastoid A-T cell lines, suggesting that ATM is absolutely required for genistein-induced signaling through Chk2. Also, our data show that cells containing ATM display increased cell survival in the presence of genistein. We speculate that genistein may activate an ATM-dependent DNA damage response pathway that protects cells from induced DNA damage.Recently, Darbon and colleagues (51Darbon J-M. Penary M. Escalas N.

In our study, wortmannin reduced phosphorylation of serine 15 of p53 and completely abrogated phosphorylation of Chk2. Moreover, we show that in two separate pairs of lymphoblastoid cell lines, the effects of genistein on p53 and Chk2 are dependent on the presence of ATM. We speculate that these differences may be due to the different types of cell lines used in the two studies.Although genistein is known to inhibit tyrosine kinases, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A did not induce phosphorylation of Chk2 or p53, suggesting that genistein is acting via a topoisomerase-dependent DNA damage response pathway rather than via inhibition of a tyrosine kinase. Genistein and etoposide have both been reported to induce DNA damage via stabilization of the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage intermediate. Although both agents induce phosphorylation of p53 and Chk2, our results show that only genistein activates an ATM-dependent pathway and suggest that etoposide is activating a different DNA damage response pathway than genistein, that is not mediated by ATM. This suggests that other protein kinases that phosphorylate p53 (at serine 15) and Chk2 at threonine 68 and possibly other sites, must be activated by etoposide treatment. Possible candidates include the related protein DNA-PK, which phosphorylates threonine 68 of Chk2 and serine 15 of p53 in vitro (Refs. 35Chan D.W Son S-C. Block W. Ye R. Douglas P. Goodarzi A.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar).Although genistein clearly activates a DNA damage response pathway, the type of damage induced by genistein remains unclear. Genistein did not induce DNA fragmentation in BT, L3, or HL60 cell lines used in this study. Similarly, genistein was only weakly effective in causing DNA damage in melanoma cells, as measured by the single cell alkaline electrophoresis (Comet) assay (51Darbon J-M. Penary M. Escalas N.

However, these results do not preclude the possibility that genistein induces a subtle form of DNA damage that was not efficiently detected by either assay method.Although genistein and etoposide both inhibit topoisomerase II,in vitro studies indicate that genistein and etoposide induce different types of DNA damage and that genistein but not etoposide also induces protein-DNA cross-links (9Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Pierre J. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that ATM is required for repair of some types of DNA damage, breaks, or cross-links but not others. Another possibility is that the combined effects of genistein on tyrosine kinases and topoisomerase II selects for or causes a specific type of lesion, the repair of which requires ATM. Interestingly, the protein-tyrosine kinase, c-Abl, has been shown to interact with ATM and to play a role in signaling of DNA damage (54Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T.

Although genistein clearly activates a DNA damage response pathway, the type of damage induced by genistein remains unclear. Genistein did not induce DNA fragmentation in BT, L3, or HL60 cell lines used in this study. Similarly, genistein was only weakly effective in causing DNA damage in melanoma cells, as measured by the single cell alkaline electrophoresis (Comet) assay (51Darbon J-M. Penary M. Escalas N.

However, these results do not preclude the possibility that genistein induces a subtle form of DNA damage that was not efficiently detected by either assay method. Although genistein and etoposide both inhibit topoisomerase II,in vitro studies indicate that genistein and etoposide induce different types of DNA damage and that genistein but not etoposide also induces protein-DNA cross-links (9Markovits J. Linassier C. Fosse P. Couprie J. Pierre J. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.-M. Le Pecq J.-B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that ATM is required for repair of some types of DNA damage, breaks, or cross-links but not others. Another possibility is that the combined effects of genistein on tyrosine kinases and topoisomerase II selects for or causes a specific type of lesion, the repair of which requires ATM. Interestingly, the protein-tyrosine kinase, c-Abl, has been shown to interact with ATM and to play a role in signaling of DNA damage (54Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T.

These domains are conserved with the cis-acting transactivation response element (TAR)-binding protein (TRBP) and dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). TRBP and PKR are involved in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression through their binding to TAR RNA. This study shows that RHA also plays an important role in TAR-mediated HIV-1 gene expression. Wild-type RHA preferably bound to TAR RNA in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of wild type RHA strongly enhanced viral mRNA synthesis and virion production as well as HIV-1 long terminal repeat-directed reporter (luciferase) gene expression. Substitution of lysine for glutamate at residue 236 in dsRBD2 (RHAK236E) reduced its affinity for TAR RNA and impaired HIV-1 transcriptional activity. These results indicate that TAR RNA is a preferred target of RHA dsRBDs and that RHA enhances HIV-1 transcription in vivo in part through the TAR-binding of RHA.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Amino acids 1–262 and 255–664 of RHA have proved to be CBP- and pol II-binding sites, respectively (3Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). RHA shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm with a cis-acting constitutive transport element in simian retroviruses (8Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that RHA is necessary for releasing both constitutive transport element- and HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE)-containing RNA from spliceosomes prior to the completion of splicing (9Li J.

Nature. 1989; 339: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). HIV-1 expression can be divided into two phases (early and late). In the early phase, the majority of viral mRNA is multiply spliced to produce 2-kb transcripts that encode the regulatory proteins, including Tat and Rev, necessary to activate HIV-1 expression. A transition subsequently occurs to accumulate singly spliced (4-kb) and full-length (9-kb) transcripts encoding the viral structural proteins and providing the genomic RNA (12Muesing M.A. Smith D.H.

Regulation of the viral RNA-splicing transition mechanism is reported to involve the protection and transport of full-length HIV-1 RNA by Rev (15Felber B.K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C.

Nature. 1989; 338: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar).TAR, a nascent viral leader RNA transcribed from the R region of the LTR, plays an important role in HIV-1 gene expression and forms a unique stem and loop structure (17Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 18Taube R. Fujinaga K. Wimmer J. Barboric M. Peterlin B.M. Virology. 1999; 264: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Tat function is mediated by the TAR RNA and requires the recruitment of a complex consisting of Tat and cyclin T1 component of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) bound to TAR (19Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). A defect of Tat-induced transactivation in murine cells was attributed to the lack of a functional cyclin T1 (20Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7056-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the defect was linked to the reduced abundance of p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (22Benkirane M. Chun R.F.

In addition, several cellular cofactors play crucial roles in HIV-1 gene expression through binding to the TAR RNA. For instance, TRBP consists of two type A dsRBDs and another type B dsRBD and activates the HIV-1 LTR (6St Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 23Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) through binding of the second type A dsRBD (dsRBD2) to the TAR RNA (24Gatignol A. Buckler C. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PKR contains two type A dsRBDs and functions as a cellular antiviral factor by inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor 2 via phosphorylation of its α-subunit (25Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A similar function of PKR is mediated by an interaction with several kinds of RNA, leading to PKR autophosphorylation (26Samuel C.E. Virology. 1991; 183: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Like TRBP and PKR, RHA possesses dsRBDs and may act as a cellular transcriptional regulator. Of particular interest is whether RHA binds to the TAR RNA and influences HIV-1 gene expression. This study shows that RHA acts as a novel TAR-binding cellular cofactor and enhances HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression and viral production in vivo.DISCUSSIONRHA belongs to the dsRNA-binding protein family, which includes TRBP and PKR. These proteins display variable RNA-binding characteristics. For instance, the PKR dsRBD1 displays higher affinity than the PKR dsRBD2 for several kinds of RNA, including the TAR RNA (37Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 38McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1992; 188: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The TRBP dsRBD2 alone can bind to TAR RNA independent of other dsRBDs (39Daviet L. Erard M. Dorin D. Duarte M. Vaquero C. Gatignol A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2419-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two polypeptides containing each of the RHA dsRBDs bind to poly(rI·rC) dsRNA with similar affinity, and it has been considered that the two RHA dsRBDs cooperate to interact with dsRNA, such as with poly(rI·rC) (7Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The results presented here show that only dsRBD2, and not dsRBD 1, could bind to TAR RNA in vitro(Fig. 2 B). This RNA-binding property of RHA is similar to that of TRBP. Gel mobility shift assays with polypeptides containing each or both RHA dsRBD were used to confirm the contribution of dsRBD1 in binding to the TAR RNA. This approach was unsuccessful due to aggregation of purified dsRBD polypeptide (data not shown).The dsRBDs interact with highly structured RNA and dsRNA, generally without obvious RNA sequence specificity (40Fierro-Monti I. Mathews M.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 241-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In fact, RHA could bind to various RNA species, including ssRNA in vitro. Like TRBP (24Gatignol A. Buckler C. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), RHA bound to the TAR RNA with higher affinity than to ssRNA or yeast tRNA and preferably bound to TAR-containing mRNA rather than TAR-negative mRNA. Thus, it appears that TAR RNA is one of the binding targets of RHA dsRBDs. These findings further demonstrate that the conserved amino acids 235–249 in the RHA dsRBD2 are essential for TAR binding. It was previously reported that the Lys-211 residue of TRBP dsRBD2 is important for interaction with TAR RNA (34Erard M. Barker D.G. Amalric F. Jeang K.T. Gatignol A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1085-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was confirmed by x-ray crystallography that the corresponding residue of Xlrbpa, the Xenopus homologue of TRBP, directly interacts with dsRNA (41Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These residues correspond to the Lys-236 residue of RHA dsRBD2, and the importance of Lys-236 was demonstrated here the using a RHA-(1–262/K236E) mutant. Together, the results confer in that the characteristics of RHA for TAR-binding are similar to those of TRBP.It is known that transcription factor levels differ between cell lines. For instance, murine NIH3T3 cells express a small amount of p300 compared with HeLa cells. Thus, the failure of HIV-1 LTR-directed transactivation by Tat in the murine cells could be attributed to the small amount of p300 (22Benkirane M. Chun R.F. Xiao H. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24898-24905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that the amount of RHA in HEK 293 cells was less than 50% that in HeLa cells, although an equivalent amount of CBP or CREB was identified in both cell lines. 3S. Aratani and T. Nakajima, unpublished observations. The HIV-1 LTR-directed luciferase activity was enhanced by exogenous RHA in HEK 293 cells but not in HeLa cells. HEK 293 cells are widely used in transfection experiments with HIV-1 proviral DNA clones (29Ulich C. Dunne A. Parry E. Hooker C.W. Gaynor R.B. Harrich D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Natarajan V. Radjendirane V. Salzman N.P. Virology. 1993; 196: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results indicate HEK 293 cells to be a favorable host cell system to assess the functions of RHA in HIV-1 gene expression by transient transfection. RHA was reported to bind weakly to HIV-1 RRE and be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 (9Li J. Tang H. Mullen T.M. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the reporter gene constructs used in this study do not contain RRE, and the results in the reporter gene assays accorded well with those in the p24 assays, suggesting that the reduced activity of RHAK236E in the p24 assays was due primarily to the lack of the TAR-binding ability of RHA in HEK 293 cells. This discrepancy may be due to either the different cell types used or to the distinct roles of RHA in transcription and post-transcriptional regulation in HIV-1 gene expression.We have previously suggested that both the ATPase/helicase activity and pol II binding ability of RHA contribute to the CREB-dependent transcription (3Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). It can be proposed from the current studies that these functions of RHA may also be important for HIV-1 transcription. Moreover, the data demonstrate that RHA enhances HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression in a κB element-dependent and -independent fashion. NF-κB functionally binds to the κB elements in the HIV-1 LTR (10Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 11Griffin G.E. Leung K. Folks T.M. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and associates with CBP (35Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J.

A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RHA was shown to mediate the association of CBP with pol II (3Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The RHAK236E mutant was capable of binding to CBP in GST pull-down assays (data not shown). Therefore, the certain activity of RHAK236E in the reporter assays using intact κB elements but not in the assays using the mutated κB elements may indicate that RHA also mediates the association of CBP with pol II on the κB-dependent HIV-1 preinitiation complex. Conversely, it was shown that RHA enhances HIV-1 gene expression, at least in part, through its TAR binding. TAR RNA is required for the recruitment of a complex consisting of Tat and the cyclin T1 component of P-TEFb (19Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

It is possible that both the ATPase/helicase activity and pol II binding ability of RHA may be required for the unwinding of highly structured RNA, such as TAR RNA, and following HIV-1 transcription. RNA helicase A (RHA)1catalyzes the unwinding of duplex RNA and DNA in a process coupled with the hydrolysis of NTPs (1Zhang S.S. Grosse F. J. Biol.

Regulation of the viral RNA-splicing transition mechanism is reported to involve the protection and transport of full-length HIV-1 RNA by Rev (15Felber B.K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C.

Nature. 1989; 338: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). TAR, a nascent viral leader RNA transcribed from the R region of the LTR, plays an important role in HIV-1 gene expression and forms a unique stem and loop structure (17Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 18Taube R. Fujinaga K. Wimmer J. Barboric M. Peterlin B.M. Virology. 1999; 264: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Tat function is mediated by the TAR RNA and requires the recruitment of a complex consisting of Tat and cyclin T1 component of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) bound to TAR (19Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). A defect of Tat-induced transactivation in murine cells was attributed to the lack of a functional cyclin T1 (20Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. Littman D.R.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7056-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the defect was linked to the reduced abundance of p300 and p300/CBP-associated factor (22Benkirane M. Chun R.F. Xiao H. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24898-24905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, several cellular cofactors play crucial roles in HIV-1 gene expression through binding to the TAR RNA. For instance, TRBP consists of two type A dsRBDs and another type B dsRBD and activates the HIV-1 LTR (6St Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 23Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) through binding of the second type A dsRBD (dsRBD2) to the TAR RNA (24Gatignol A. Buckler C. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PKR contains two type A dsRBDs and functions as a cellular antiviral factor by inhibiting eukaryotic initiation factor 2 via phosphorylation of its α-subunit (25Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A similar function of PKR is mediated by an interaction with several kinds of RNA, leading to PKR autophosphorylation (26Samuel C.E. Virology. 1991; 183: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Like TRBP and PKR, RHA possesses dsRBDs and may act as a cellular transcriptional regulator. Of particular interest is whether RHA binds to the TAR RNA and influences HIV-1 gene expression. This study shows that RHA acts as a novel TAR-binding cellular cofactor and enhances HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression and viral production in vivo. DISCUSSIONRHA belongs to the dsRNA-binding protein family, which includes TRBP and PKR. These proteins display variable RNA-binding characteristics. For instance, the PKR dsRBD1 displays higher affinity than the PKR dsRBD2 for several kinds of RNA, including the TAR RNA (37Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 38McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1992; 188: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The TRBP dsRBD2 alone can bind to TAR RNA independent of other dsRBDs (39Daviet L. Erard M. Dorin D. Duarte M. Vaquero C. Gatignol A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2419-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two polypeptides containing each of the RHA dsRBDs bind to poly(rI·rC) dsRNA with similar affinity, and it has been considered that the two RHA dsRBDs cooperate to interact with dsRNA, such as with poly(rI·rC) (7Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The results presented here show that only dsRBD2, and not dsRBD 1, could bind to TAR RNA in vitro(Fig. 2 B). This RNA-binding property of RHA is similar to that of TRBP. Gel mobility shift assays with polypeptides containing each or both RHA dsRBD were used to confirm the contribution of dsRBD1 in binding to the TAR RNA. This approach was unsuccessful due to aggregation of purified dsRBD polypeptide (data not shown).The dsRBDs interact with highly structured RNA and dsRNA, generally without obvious RNA sequence specificity (40Fierro-Monti I. Mathews M.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 241-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In fact, RHA could bind to various RNA species, including ssRNA in vitro. Like TRBP (24Gatignol A. Buckler C. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2193-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), RHA bound to the TAR RNA with higher affinity than to ssRNA or yeast tRNA and preferably bound to TAR-containing mRNA rather than TAR-negative mRNA. Thus, it appears that TAR RNA is one of the binding targets of RHA dsRBDs. These findings further demonstrate that the conserved amino acids 235–249 in the RHA dsRBD2 are essential for TAR binding. It was previously reported that the Lys-211 residue of TRBP dsRBD2 is important for interaction with TAR RNA (34Erard M. Barker D.G. Amalric F. Jeang K.T. Gatignol A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1085-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It was confirmed by x-ray crystallography that the corresponding residue of Xlrbpa, the Xenopus homologue of TRBP, directly interacts with dsRNA (41Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These residues correspond to the Lys-236 residue of RHA dsRBD2, and the importance of Lys-236 was demonstrated here the using a RHA-(1–262/K236E) mutant. Together, the results confer in that the characteristics of RHA for TAR-binding are similar to those of TRBP.It is known that transcription factor levels differ between cell lines. For instance, murine NIH3T3 cells express a small amount of p300 compared with HeLa cells. Thus, the failure of HIV-1 LTR-directed transactivation by Tat in the murine cells could be attributed to the small amount of p300 (22Benkirane M. Chun R.F. Xiao H. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24898-24905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that the amount of RHA in HEK 293 cells was less than 50% that in HeLa cells, although an equivalent amount of CBP or CREB was identified in both cell lines. 3S. Aratani and T. Nakajima, unpublished observations. The HIV-1 LTR-directed luciferase activity was enhanced by exogenous RHA in HEK 293 cells but not in HeLa cells. HEK 293 cells are widely used in transfection experiments with HIV-1 proviral DNA clones (29Ulich C. Dunne A. Parry E. Hooker C.W. Gaynor R.B. Harrich D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Natarajan V. Radjendirane V. Salzman N.P. Virology. 1993; 196: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results indicate HEK 293 cells to be a favorable host cell system to assess the functions of RHA in HIV-1 gene expression by transient transfection. RHA was reported to bind weakly to HIV-1 RRE and be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 (9Li J. Tang H. Mullen T.M. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the reporter gene constructs used in this study do not contain RRE, and the results in the reporter gene assays accorded well with those in the p24 assays, suggesting that the reduced activity of RHAK236E in the p24 assays was due primarily to the lack of the TAR-binding ability of RHA in HEK 293 cells. This discrepancy may be due to either the different cell types used or to the distinct roles of RHA in transcription and post-transcriptional regulation in HIV-1 gene expression.We have previously suggested that both the ATPase/helicase activity and pol II binding ability of RHA contribute to the CREB-dependent transcription (3Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). It can be proposed from the current studies that these functions of RHA may also be important for HIV-1 transcription. Moreover, the data demonstrate that RHA enhances HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression in a κB element-dependent and -independent fashion. NF-κB functionally binds to the κB elements in the HIV-1 LTR (10Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 11Griffin G.E. Leung K. Folks T.M. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and associates with CBP (35Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J.

A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RHA was shown to mediate the association of CBP with pol II (3Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The RHAK236E mutant was capable of binding to CBP in GST pull-down assays (data not shown). Therefore, the certain activity of RHAK236E in the reporter assays using intact κB elements but not in the assays using the mutated κB elements may indicate that RHA also mediates the association of CBP with pol II on the κB-dependent HIV-1 preinitiation complex. Conversely, it was shown that RHA enhances HIV-1 gene expression, at least in part, through its TAR binding. TAR RNA is required for the recruitment of a complex consisting of Tat and the cyclin T1 component of P-TEFb (19Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

https://openalex.org/W2079756964,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF5) forms a complex with eIF2 by interacting with the β subunit of eIF2. This interaction is essential for eIF5-promoted hydrolysis of GTP bound to the 40 S initiation complex. In this work, we show that, in addition to the eIF2β-binding region at the C terminus of eIF5, the N-terminal region of eIF5 is also required for eIF5-dependent GTP hydrolysis. Like other GTPase-activating proteins, eIF5 contains an invariant arginine residue (Arg-15) at its N terminus that is essential for its function. Mutation of this arginine residue to alanine or even to conservative lysine caused a severe defect in the ability of eIF5 to promote GTP hydrolysis from the 40 S initiation complex, although the ability of these mutant proteins to bind to eIF2β remained unchanged. These mutants were also defective in overall protein synthesis as well as in their ability to support cell growth of a Δ<i>TIF5</i>yeast strain. Additionally, alanine substitution mutagenesis of eIF5 defined Lys-33 and Lys-55 as also critical for eIF5 function <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The implications of these results in relation to other well characterized GAPs are discussed and provide additional evidence that eIF5 functions as a GTPase-activating protein."
https://openalex.org/W2089311123,"Bacteriorhodopsin, the light-driven proton pump of Halobacterium salinarum, consists of the membrane apoprotein bacterioopsin and a covalently bound retinal cofactor. The mechanism by which retinal is synthesized and bound to bacterioopsinin vivo is unknown. As a step toward identifying cellular factors involved in this process, we constructed an in-frame deletion of brp, a gene implicated in bacteriorhodopsin biogenesis. In the Δbrp strain, bacteriorhodopsin levels are decreased ∼4.0-fold compared with wild type, whereas bacterioopsin levels are normal. The probable precursor of retinal, β-carotene, is increased ∼3.8-fold, whereas retinal is decreased by ∼3.7-fold. These results suggest that brp is involved in retinal synthesis. Additional cellular factors may substitute forbrp function in the Δbrp strain because retinal production is not abolished. The in-frame deletion ofblh, a brp paralog identified by analysis of the Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genome, reduced bacteriorhodopsin accumulation on solid medium but not in liquid. However, deletion of both brp and blh abolished bacteriorhodopsin and retinal production in liquid medium, again without affecting bacterioopsin accumulation. The level of β-carotene increased ∼5.3-fold. The simplest interpretation of these results is that brp and blh encode similar proteins that catalyze or regulate the conversion of β-carotene to retinal."

Its action is usually favored by ubiquitous enzymes (e.g. glutathione S-transferases, glutathione peroxidase). GSH also regenerates other important defensive resources (e.g. vitamins E and C) and directly participates in the destruction of reactive oxygen species (1Meister A. in Glutathione, Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects.in: Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. part A. New York, John Wiley & Sons1989: 1-49Google Scholar). The alkylation of glutathione by electrophilic reagents and the reduction of chemically reactive oxidant species are biological functions associated with the protection of SH groups of critical cellular macromolecules (2Smith C.dV.

In fact, the modification of PSH1 has been usually considered only a potential damaging reaction, even if some authors suggested that chemical alteration of some cysteine residues may have a protective or regulatory role (4Ziegler D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 5Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The participation of PSH in quantitatively important reactions is proportional to their concentration and reactivity. The intrinsic reactivity of PSH is dependent on the pK a value (the thiolate anion is much more reactive than the undissociated form) and its accessibility (structural and conformational features). In fact, some proteins such as albumin (6Di Simplicio P. Lusini L. Giannerini F. Giustarini D. Bellelli A. Boumis G. Amiconi G. Rossi R. Moncada S. Nisticò G. Bagetta G. Higgs E.A Nitric Oxide and the Cell: Proliferation and Death. Portland Press Ltd., London1998: 47-59Google Scholar) with relatively low pK a values have an apparent reactivity much lower than that of GSH. It follows from this that PSH may have a wide range of apparent reactivity that spans 4 orders of magnitude (7Rossi R. Lusini L. Giannerini F. Giustarini D. Lungarella G. Di Simplicio P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This fact has abrogated any efforts to understand the effective defensive contribution of PSH. More recently, the attention on PSH as important modulators of the intracellular redox state has been renewed and emphasized (5Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 8Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar, 9Drodge W. Eck H.P. Mihm S. Galter D. Pasquier C. Olivier R.Y. Auclair C. Packer L. Oxidative Stress, Cell Activation and Viral Infection. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1994: 285-299Crossref Google Scholar), and reports of PSH having reactivity very similar to or greater than that of GSH are increasing. Recently, the problem has become more interesting because a large number of papers have focused on the importance of the cooperation between GSH and protein SH group, in particular hemoglobin, in nitric oxide transport, and targeting (10Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar, 11Stamler J.S. Jia L. Eu J.P. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J. Gernert K. Piantadosi C.A. Science. 1997; 276: 2035-2037Crossref Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of PSH and GSH as similar cooperating groups in the metabolism of electrophiles, oxidizing agents, and nitric oxide remains an open question. Our previous studies have demonstrated that rat hemoglobin possesses reacting cysteines located on the β chain at position 125 (12Rossi R. Barra D. Bellelli A. Boumis G. Canofeni S. Di Simplicio P. Lusini L. Pascarella S. Amiconi G.,. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19198-19206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These cysteinyl residues, given their reactivity and concentration in rat blood, competing and cooperating with GSH, may influence the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and action of many drugs or their metabolites. To verify whether and by which mechanism, the reactivity of rat Hb cysteines leads to an unusual metabolism of some thiol reactants, we analyzed the effect of three different drug categories, oxidants, electrophiles, and NO donors on human and rat erythrocytes. Among the oxidants we used were drugs that react with GSH either enzymatically (via GSH-peroxidase, i.e. hydroperoxydes) or nonenzymatically (diamide, menadione); similarly, electrophiles that conjugate with GSH by glutathione S-transferases catalysis or spontaneously (13Sies H. Ketterer B. Glutathione Conjugation. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1988Google Scholar) were tested. The membrane-permeable NO donorS-nitrosocysteine was also used to evaluate the extent of transnitrosation reactions carried out by PSH. Glutathione, glutathione disulfide, and glutathione reductase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; HPLC grade chemicals were from BDH; BCNU was from Bristol-Myers Squibb (Dublin, Ireland). Diamide (diazenedicarboxylic acid bis(N,N-dimethylamide)), menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone), tert-butyl hydroperoxide, human serum albumin, and all other chemicals of analytical grade were from Sigma. Male Wistar rats (2 months old, 300-g body weight) were purchased from Charles River (Como, Italy). Blood was collected from the abdominal aorta under anesthesia with diethylether. Human blood was obtained from healthy volunteers (30–45 years old). For all blood samples K3EDTA was used as anticoagulant. For in vitro treatments each blood sample was washed with PBS containing 10 mmglucose and was adjusted to a hematocrit value of 37.5% with the same buffer. Red blood cells samples were placed in plastic tubes, incubated at 37 °C in a thermostatic rotating (100 rev/min) bath, and then exposed to the different substances. For the in vivo treatment BCNU was infused via PE-50 tubing cannulated into the femoral vein, whereas blood was collected from a PE-50 tubing cannulated into the jugular vein. Both tubes were connected to a double valve (model 617, 20 × 20 mm, Danuso Instruments, Milano, Italy). Valves and tubing were implanted 2 days before the experiment, under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg body weight). Blood aliquots were deproteinized by the addition of four volumes of 5% trichloroacetic acid; GSH and GSSG were then determined on the clear supernatant. GSH was assayed enzymatically, using CDNB and glutathioneS-transferases (12Rossi R. Barra D. Bellelli A. Boumis G. Canofeni S. Di Simplicio P. Lusini L. Pascarella S. Amiconi G.,. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19198-19206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); GSSG was assayed enzymatically at 340 nm by the procedure of Klotzsch and Bergmeyer (14Klotzsch H. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1965: 363-366Google Scholar). To determine GSSP concentrations, acid precipitated proteins were washed thoroughly with the precipitating solution until no trace of soluble GSH or GSSG was detected. The pellets were then resuspended and brought to an alkaline pH (pH 7.5–8.0 for samples of rat red blood cells and pH 12.0 for the human erythrocytes). The alkaline pH (12.0) is used in human samples because only under these conditions all mixed disulfides are released; for rat samples slightly alkaline buffers were used (pH 7.5–8.0), but similar results are obtained at pH 12.0. Under these conditions GSH is released via an SH/SS exchange reaction as previously described by Rossi et al. (15Rossi R. Cardaioli E. Scaloni A. Amiconi G. Di Simplicio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1243: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The amount of released GSH was assayed enzymatically in the supernatant (see above). Rat hemoglobin was purified by crystallization from stroma-free hemolysate by the method of Condò et al. (16Condò S.G. Giardina B. Barra D. Gill S.J. Brunori M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Human hemoglobin was prepared using the method of Riggs (17Riggs A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 5-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin stocks were prepared and maintained under N2. The amount of oxidized hemoglobin was checked spectrophotometrically before each experiment on the basis of the 576/541 nm absorbance ratio (18Giardina B. Amiconi G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PSH of hemoglobin were assayed spectrophotometrically with DTNB at 450 nm (εmM = 7.0 mm−1 cm−1): hemoglobin was adjusted to pH 7.4 with 0.2 m sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, and then the reaction was started by addition of DTNB (final concentration, 0.2 mm). Fast reacting SH groups were titrated by means of an Applied Photophysics MV 17 stopped flow apparatus; samples of hemoglobin in 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were rapidly mixed with equal volumes of a solution containing 0.4 mm DTNB in 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Data were fitted to a single exponential curve for the human protein and a three exponential curve for those of rat using the SigmaPlot, version 2.01 (Jandel Scientific). Glutathione reductase activity determination was carried out at room temperature on hemolysate, previously passed through a Sephadex G-25 column, according to standard methods (19Butler E. J. Clin. Invest. 1969; 48: 1957-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cys-NO was freshly prepared by combining equimolar concentrations of 200 mm Cys in 0.75n HCl and 200 mm potassium nitrite in the presence of 0.1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. After 3–5 min, the mixture was neutralized with 1 m Tris. Cys-NO and nitrosoproteins titration was carried out after decomposition of the S-NO bond with Hg2+ and is based on the colorimetric determination of NO2−(20). Glutathione conjugates and free substances were determined on deproteinized samples (final concentration, 5% trichloroacetic acid) by HPLC or by spectrophotometry. Glutathione-CDNB and glutathione-EA conjugates were measured by evaluation of the peak at 340 and 290 nm absorbance, respectively; free CDNB and EA were titrated by end point reactions after the addition of glutathione transferases and an excess of GSH. All other drugs and their adducts with GSH were measured by HPLC. Briefly, deproteinized samples were loaded onto a Sephasil C18 (250 × 4.6 mm) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted by the application of a linear gradient of methanol: 0–10 min 20% methanol 80% acetate buffer (100 mm, pH 4.5), 10–30 min linear gradient 20–100% methanol. For HPLC determination of glutathione conjugates of BCNU, a BioRad Biosil NH2 column (250 × 4.6 mm) was used; deproteinized samples were treated with iodoacetic acid for 45 min ( final concentration, 15 mm) at neutral pH and derivatized with an alcoholic 1.5% solution of 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (1:1 for 3 h). Samples were eluted by the application of a linear gradient of 0.5 m acetate buffer, pH 4.7, after a 10-min isocratic phase (0–10 min with 20% acetate, 80% methanol; 10–30 min with 20–90% acetate). An Hewlett Packard HPLC Series 1100 equipped with diode array detector was used. All spectrophotometric determinations were carried out with a JASCO UV550 apparatus. Treatment of human and rat erythrocytes with oxidizing substances evidenced remarkable differences between the two species; hydrogen peroxide or organic hydroperoxides (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) produced a rapid oxidation of GSH to GSSG (Fig. 1), both in human and rat red blood cells. However, rat erythrocytes were also characterized by a subsequent, rapid formation of glutathione-protein mixed disulfides (GSSP). The initial thiolic homeostasis was completely restored within 1 h of drug exposure. Diamide (a specific oxidant for thiol groups) rapidly increased GSSG levels in human red blood cells; conversely, it produced GSSP but not GSSG in rat erythrocytes. Fig. 1 shows the results of the treatment of rat and human red blood cells with menadione (vitamin K3). Menadione is a quinone reagent that produces oxidative modifications in biological systems, mainly through redox cycling reactions with oxygen (menadione binds to thiol groups to form a conjugate able to redox cycle like menadione itself) (21Ross D. Thor H. Orrenius S. Moldeus P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1985; 55: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Human red blood cells were essentially characterized by a rapid GSH disappearance with a negligible (if any) production of GSSG and GSSP. In contrast, in rat erytrocytes, menadione immediately produced large amounts of GSSG, which in turn were transformed into GSSP. In both cases, human and rat red blood cells were not able to restore initial levels of GSH. Total glutathione (GSH + GSSG + GSSP) was greatly decreased in human samples, whereas only a slight decrease was found in rat erythrocytes. Glutathione alky(ary)lation by electrophilic reagents is considered an important metabolic pathway of many drugs and their intermediates. The formation of these conjugates is a detoxification reaction because the glutathione-electrophile adduct is usually less toxic than the parent molecule; after its formation, the conjugate is exported to the extracellular milieu by specific transporters (22Awasthi S. Singhal S.S. Srivastava S.K. Torman R.T. Zimniak P. Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Singh S.V. Piper J.T. Awasthi Y, C. Pikula S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5231-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). GSH alky(ary)lation is usually catalyzed by GSH S-transferases, a ubiquitous class of isoenzymes, which can be divided into four families (α, μ, π, and τ encoded by different genes) (23Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Rat and human red blood cells were treated with two known substrates of GSH S-transferases (CDNB and EA) and with other reagents that conjugate GSH nonenzymatically (N-ethylmaleimide) or after decomposition into subproducts (BCNU). After drug addition (1 mm, approximately at a molar ratio of 1:1 with GSH), a rapid increase in intraerythrocytic GSH conjugates (Fig.2 A) was detected in all samples, followed by their export to the extracellular medium (Fig.2 B). However, remarkable differences were evident between rat and human red blood cells. In particular, in the rat, the peak of intraerythrocytic GSH conjugates was always much lower than that obtained in human samples; similarly, the amount of exported conjugate was considerably lower than in human erythrocytes. In parallel, GSH was almost totally depleted in human erythrocytes treated with EA, CDNB, BCNU, or N-ethylmaleimide, but not in rat red blood cells; a percentage varying from 65 to 95% of initial GSH was still present in rat erythrocytes after 4 h of exposure (Table I).Table IGSH concentration in rat or human red blood cells (37.5% Hct in PBS) after 4 h of treatment with various drugs (1 mm, 37 °C)GSHHumanRatnmol/mlNo treatment851 ± 84833 ± 101CDNB15 ± 5684 ± 41EA20 ± 5699 ± 66NEM0721 ± 81BCNU44 ± 31789 ± 54The number of replicates was three.

A large interest in the biochemistry of SH groups has been stimulated by the discovery that they can have an active role in nitric oxide metabolism and targeting through the formation ofS-nitrosothiols. These molecules have been shown to undergo exchange reactions with low and high molecular weight thiols, reactions of primary importance in the final effect of nitric oxide itself (24Mathews W.R. Kerr S.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 267: 1529-1537PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 3, the influence of a treatment of red blood cells with S-nitrosocysteine on the levels of intracellular protein S-nitrosothiols is shown.S-Nitrosocysteine is a compound able to cross plasma membranes rapidly and to exchange NO+ group with other thiols. The kinetics of these reactions are governed by the reactivity and concentration of various thiol groups. Only slight variations inS-nitrosoprotein levels were found when human erythrocytes were used; conversely, under the same conditions rat red blood cells rapidly produced high levels of S-nitrosohemoglobin. Among the substances used in the present work, some are known to be exclusively metabolized (at least in red blood cells) through conjugation with SH groups, whereas hydroperoxides (25Stern A. Sies H. Oxidative Stress. Academic Press, London1985: 331-349Crossref Google Scholar) and menadione (26Winterbourn C.C. French J.K. Claridge R.F.C. Biochem. J. 1979; 179: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) can also react with Fe2+ of the Hb heme group. In TableII the t12 and the time required for complete disappearance of free drugs (we did not consider those metabolized also by heme groups) are reported. Rat red blood cells removed all substances at a significant higher rate; within a few minutes (1–5 min) all substances were in fact under the detection limit, whereas high levels of drugs were maintained in human erythrocytes for a long time. BCNU (the rate-limiting step is given by its spontaneous decomposition) was metabolized more slowly by both systems; however, its t 12, as previously reported (27Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was half in rat erythrocytes compared with that in human red blood cells.Table IIHalf-life and time required for complete removal of various drugs (diamide, 2 mm; all other drugs, 1 mm; 37 °C) in rat or human red blood cells (37.5% Hct in PBS)t 1/2Time required for complete removalHumanRatHumanRatDiamide10 min<30 s30 min<30 sCDNB20 min<30 s2 h3 minEA25 min<30 s2 h4 minNEM1 min<30 s2 min<30 sBCNU1 h30 min>4 h3.5 hCys-NO45 min2 min2.5 h5 minThe number of replicate experiments was 4.

Rat hemoglobin (Fig. 4) was characterized by a rapid reaction when compared with other low molecular weight thiols or protein cysteines (human Hb, human serum albumin, GSH, N-acetylcysteine); the shape of the titration curve is essentially biphasic, showing an initial burst phase followed by a slower increase in absorbance. The most important feature is that some rat hemoglobin sulfhydryls, located at the β125 position (12Rossi R. Barra D. Bellelli A. Boumis G. Canofeni S. Di Simplicio P. Lusini L. Pascarella S. Amiconi G.,. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19198-19206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), are far more reactive than GSH itself; other cysteines, in positions α13 and β93, are far less reactive. Titration of these cysteines corresponds to the slower phase of the curve. Human Hb possesses only one slow reacting cysteine at position β93 (28Garel M.C. Beuzard Y. Thillet J. Domenget C. Martin J. Galacteros F. Rosa J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The second order rate constant (k 2) of rat Hb Cys-β125 is about 1 order of magnitude greater than that of GSH and other low molecular weight thiols and 3–4 orders of magnitude greater than thek 2 of other protein cysteinyl residues. Rat and human red blood cells used in previous experiments (Figs. 2 and3) were also assayed for Hb-SH content; in TableIII data obtained at the end of the experiment (4 h) are reported. Rat Hb-SH β93 and α13, as well as human Hb-SH β93, were modified negligibly by the treatments; in contrast, rat Hb-SH β125 (Table III and Fig.5) were significantly decreased (the depletion of Cys-β125 is highlighted by the lower absorbance reached by tracings within 1 s). Depletion of rat Hb Cys-β125 elicited by drug addition, ranged from 650 to 850 μm and was consistent with the amount of drug, which was not found as glutathione conjugate. A dose-dependent depletion of Hb Cys-β125 was also induced by the oxidants, diamide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and menadione (data not shown).Table IIILevels of Hb SH groups in rat or human red blood cells (37.5% Hct in PBS) after 4 h of treatment with various drugs (1 mm, 37 °C)Hemoglobin SH groups (mm)Human (β93)Rat (β125)Rat (α13)Rat (β93)No treatment4332 ± 1543722 ± 984316 ± 1214451 ± 125CDNB4365 ± 953065 ± 101aStatistically significant with respect to control values (p < 0.001, Student'st test).4310 ± 654423 ± 69EA4299 ± 1252994 ± 124aStatistically significant with respect to control values (p < 0.001, Student'st test).4401 ± 344401 ± 84NEM4321 ± 942894 ± 93aStatistically significant with respect to control values (p < 0.001, Student'st test).4312 ± 944382 ± 59BCNU4399 ± 842994 ± 49aStatistically significant with respect to control values (p < 0.001, Student'st test).4352 ± 454450 ± 61The number of replicates was four.a Statistically significant with respect to control values (p < 0.001, Student'st test). Open table in a new tab The number of replicates was four. Glutathione is commonly considered to be the first line of defense against oxidizing molecules; it also plays an important role in the detoxification pathways of electrophilic drugs (29Meister A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1983; 11: 793-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Many models show how GSH depletors may initiate irreversible damage only after a significant decrease (greater than 70–80%) of tissue GSH. The involvement of the SH groups of proteins in GSH-typical reactions has been regarded as marginal, in quantitative terms, and as deleterious to protein structure and function. Even if protein thiols are usually more concentrated than GSH in cellular pools, their reactivity is usually 2–4 orders of magnitude lower; this allows GSH to exhibit its protective role (30Jocelyn P.C. Biochemistry of the SH Group. Academic Press, London1972Google Scholar). The catalysis of a wide number of conjugation reactions by glutathione transferases provides a further protection of protein SH groups by GSH (2Smith C.dV. Mitchell J.R. inGlutathione, Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects.in: Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 1-43Google Scholar). The reaction rate of small thiols (i.e. N-acetylcysteine, cysteine, or glutathione) with titrating molecules is usually well correlated with the pK a of the sulfydryl group (which normally lies between pH 8.5 and 9.5). However, for PSH, accessibility as well as the dissociation state of the sulfur must be considered (3Torchinsky Y.M. Sulphur in Proteins. Pergamon Press, Oxford1981Google Scholar). Various protein SH groups have been identified as “fast reacting,” for example, SH of cysteine proteases (papain) (31Halasz P. Polgar L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), or SH involved in the catalysis of glycolytic reactions (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (32Brodie A.E. Reed D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); however, their overall quantitative contribution to the metabolism of electrophiles or oxidants is clearly marginal. Blood is characterized by the presence of high concentrations of Hb (8–10 mm, as monomer), a value significantly larger than GSH (0.8–1 mm). It is well known that human Hb has only one titrable pair of thiols per tetramer (Cys(F9)93β) and that its reactivity is also dependent on the quaternary conformation, being slower in the deoxy state (10Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1471) Google Scholar). Cys-β93 of human Hb is shielded by a hydrogen bond between Asp-94 and Glu-90 (28Garel M.C. Beuzard Y. Thillet J. Domenget C. Martin J. Galacteros F. Rosa J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is also influenced by the vicinity of the terminal carboxyl group. Rat hemoglobin is known to possess extra reactive SH groups compared with human Hb; cysteines located at β125 and α13 (33Ferranti P. Carbone V. Sannolo N. Fiume I. Malorni A. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 1943-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) positions were identified as additional potentially reactive cysteinyl groups. Cysteine β125 was shown to have a low pK a, a high accessibility, and consequently a strong reactivity (12Rossi R. Barra D. Bellelli A. Boumis G. Canofeni S. Di Simplicio P. Lusini L. Pascarella S. Amiconi G.,. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19198-19206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, its reactivity is not influenced by allosteric changes in the protein. This low pK is due to a hydrogen bridge between SH of Cys-β125 and Ser-123, where SH is the hydrogen donor. Comparison (Fig. 4) of the reaction kinetics of various SH groups with DTNB demonstrated how rat Hb is essentially characterized by two different families of thiols. One family has a reaction rate 1 and 3 orders of magnitude greater than small thiols and other protein thiols (e.g. human Hb Cys-β93), respectively. This has proved the existence of thiols on rat Hb possessing an unusually high reactivity. The task is now to verify whether this anomaly can in any way influence the overall metabolism of some agents. Usually, treatment with oxidizing agents (e.g. organic hydroperoxides) leads to the oxidation of GSH into GSSG. After drug reduction, the system recovers the initial levels of GSH. If the oxidative stress is severe, a SH-SS exchange reaction between GSSG and PSH can take place (34Di Simplicio P. Cacace M.G. Lusini L. Giannerini F. Giustarini D. Rossi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 35Di Simplicio P. Rossi R. Biochim. Biophys.

These findings fueled speculation that ClC-2 can compensate for impaired chloride transport in epithelial tissues affected by cystic fibrosis and lacking the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. However, direct evidence linking ClC-2 channel expression to epithelial chloride secretion was lacking. In the present studies, we show that ClC-2 transcripts and protein are present endogenously in the Caco-2 cell line, a cell line that models the human small intestine. Using an antisense strategy we show that ClC-2 contributes to native chloride currents in Caco-2 cells measured by patch clamp electrophysiology. Antisense ClC-2-transfected monolayers of Caco-2 cells exhibited less chloride secretion (monitored as iodide efflux) than did mock transfected monolayers, providing the first direct molecular evidence that ClC-2 can contribute to chloride secretion by the human intestinal epithelium. Further, examination of ClC-2 localization by confocal microscopy revealed that ClC-2 contributes to secretion from a unique location in this epithelium, from the apical aspect of the tight junction complex.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 3Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). ClC-2 channel activity has been implicated in the regulation of neuronal responses to GABA-A receptor interaction (2Staley K. Smith R. Schaack J. Wilcox C. Jentsch T. Neuron. 1996; 17: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In non-neuronal cells, ClC-2 function has been linked to volume regulation, and in epithelial cells, it has been linked specifically to chloride secretion (3Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization studies of ClC-2 revealed that it is situated on the apical surface of airway epithelial cells in neonatal rat airways (4Murray C.B. Morales M.M. Flotte T.R. McGrath-Morrow S.A. Guggino W.B. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Subsequent Ussing chamber studies showed that luminal acidity promoted chloride secretion in neonatal airway cells via a cadmium-sensitive channel (5Blaisdell C.J. Edmonds R.D. Wang X.T. Guggino S. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L1248-L1255PubMed Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to suggest that ClC-2, a channel that exhibits these properties, may mediate chloride secretion in neonatal rat airways. In addition, Schwiebert et al. (6Schwiebert EM Cid-Soto LP Stafford D Carter M Blaisdell CJ Zeitlin PL Guggino WB Cutting GR Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) reported that ClC-2-like currents are present in airway epithelial cells derived from an adult patient with cystic fibrosis (CF)1 and suggested chloride transport via ClC-2 may be able to compensate for defective or absent CFTR chloride channels in the CF airway epithelium. Further, because ClC-2 message can be detected in intestinal epithelial tissue obtained from cftr-knockout mice, Joo et al. (7Joo N.S. Clarke L.L. Han B.H. Forte L.R. Kim H.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) also suggested that there is the potential for ClC-2 to provide a bypass pathway for chloride transport in CF affected intestines. Despite these intriguing observations, there was no direct molecular evidence to suggest that ClC-2 contributes to native chloride secretion. In the present work, we assessed the role of ClC-2 in chloride secretion in the Caco-2 cell line, a cell line that models the human small intestinal epithelium (8Rousset M. Laburther M. Pinto M. Chevalier G. Rouyer-Fessard C. Dussaulx E. Trugnan G. Boige N. Brun J.L. Zweibaum A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 123: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 9Sood R. Bear C. Auerbach W. Reyes E. Jensen T. Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Buchwald M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2487-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, we confirmed that ClC-2 protein is endogenously expressed in the plasma membrane of Caco-2 cells. Further, we show that it is uniquely situated at the apical aspect of the tight junctions between cells in fully differentiated monolayers of these cells. Using an antisense strategy, we show that endogenously expressed ClC-2 mediates currents across the plasma membrane of single Caco-2 cells and, finally, that ClC-2 can contribute to native anion secretion across Caco-2 cell monolayers. Caco-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They were grown in Earl's α-minimum essential medium (Wisent Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. For patch clamp studies, cells were used 1–2 days after plating onto 35-mm coverslips (Fisher). For Ussing chamber studies of chloride currents and assessment of ClC-2 localization by confocal microscopy, Caco-2 cells were seeded at high density (1 × 106 cells ml−1, 500 μl/filter) and grown to confluency on clear Snapwell (Costar) filters (pore size, 4 μm; diameter, 12 mm). Filters were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air, for 2 weeks with medium replacement every 2–3 days. The formation of an intact monolayer was assessed by measuring transepithelial resistance in Ussing chambers. Transepithelial resistance was calculated using Ohm's law, from measurements of the change in short circuit current measured (I sc, μA) upon passing 1 mV across the epithelium. Monolayers were considered acceptable when the transepithelial resistance exceeded 500 Ohms/cm2 and the transepithelial potential difference exceeded 2 mV. Alternatively, for iodide efflux studies and assessment of protein expression by Western blotting and confocal microscopy following transfection, Caco-2 cells were grown for 4–6 days on glass coverslips to achieve a differentiated phenotype, as documented by Sood et al. (9Sood R. Bear C. Auerbach W. Reyes E. Jensen T. Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Buchwald M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2487-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from Caco-2 cell monolayers using the Trizol method as recommended by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA (2 μg) was analyzed on agarose gels (1%) containing 0.6 m formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were cross-linked with UV radiation and hybridized with mouse-specific ClC-2 cDNA fragments radiolabeled by random priming (10Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Final conditions of washing included 0.2× SSC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) with 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. The blots were exposed to X-Omat film (Kodak) for 24–72 h at −70 °C with one intensifying screen. Caco-2 cells, grown on 60-mm plastic dishes, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm mono-dibasic mix, pH 6.8, and 150 mm NaCl, final pH 7.2, and incubated with 900 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 25 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 μg/ml) and apotinin (10 μg/ml), 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm E64, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were scraped off, and the suspension was mixed by vortexing. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 48,000 × g to isolate a crude membrane preparation. Following protein assay of the supernatant, 50 μg of this preparation was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% gel) using anti-ClC-2 antibody at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. This polyclonal antibody, as described previously, was generated against a GST fusion peptide containing amino acids 31–74 of rat ClC-2 (rClC-2 cDNA kindly provided by T. Jentsch). The ClC-2-specific antibody was immunopurified from a matrix of GST-N-peptide coupled on an activated agarose column as previously described (11Xiong H. Li C. Garami E. Wang Y. Ramjeesingh M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Gyomorey K. Yeger H. Ackerley C. Garami E. Bear C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1787-C1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody against β-actin (Sigma, anti-β-actin clone AC-74) was used at 1/1000 dilution. Immunoreactive protein was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunofluorescence labeling was performed on Caco-2 cells grown on 35-mm circular coverslips or on clear 35-mm, 0.4-μm pore Snapwell (Corning Costar) filters. The pattern of ClC-2 labeling was identical regardless of the support employed. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde AM (4% in phosphate-buffered saline) and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated for 0.5 h at 25 °C in 5% normal goat serum, 0.05% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline containing 10 mm Tris-Cl and 150 mm NaCl with final pH 8, and then for 2.5 h with the polyclonal antibody against ClC-2 (30.7 μg/ml) or overnight in the refrigerator with the polyclonal antibody against ClC-3 (30 μg/ml) (Alomone Labs Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel). Then the cells were washed and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (0.02 mg/ml; Molecular Probes) and washed again before mounting. For colocalization studies of ClC-2 and the tight junction protein occludin, the above procedure was followed by additional incubation with the monoclonal anti-occludin antibody (0.002 mg/ml, Zymed Laboratories Inc., Missisauga, Canada) for 1 h and washed. Cells were then incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (0.02 mg/ml; Molecular Probes) and washed before mounting. For the competition studies, the anti-ClC-2 antibody was preincubated with 2-fold excess of the antigenic fusion peptide overnight at 4 °C before incubation. Slides were viewed on an Olympus Vanox AHBT3 microscope using epifluorescence, and images were captured using the Image Pro Plus program (Cybernetics, L.P.). For confocal microscopy, sections (each 0.7 μm in thickness) were viewed with a 100x objective a Leica TCS 4D microsope, and the images were captured using the SCANware 5.01 program. Caco-2 cell membrane currents were measured using conventional whole cell patch clamp technique (13Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann E. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 191: 85-100Crossref Scopus (15172) Google Scholar). Patch clamp electrodes were prepared from borosilicate glass capillaries (outer diameter, 1.5 mm; inner diameter, 1.18 mm) with an inner filament (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) on a Narishige PP-83 patch electrode puller using the standard two-pull technique. The tip resistance was 3–5 mΩ when filled with pipette solution (see below for composition). Whole cell currents were measured using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and were filtered at 100 Hz with a 6-pore Bessel Filter. Sampling rate was 4 kHz for most data, and junction potentials were corrected. Voltage clamp protocols were generated using pCLAMP software (version 7, Axon Instruments) via a Pentium II computer interfaced with a 1200 series Digidata (Axon Instruments) The same software package was used both for data acquisition and analysis. Current-voltage relationships were determined in a stepwise clamp protocol. From a holding potential of −30 mV, voltage pulses of 3.0 s were applied from −160 to +40 mV in 20-mV increments. The bath solution contained 140 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine (NMDG) chloride, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, whereas the pipette solution contained 140 mm NMDG chloride, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES. Both pipette and bath solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4 and 260 mOsm. In experiments in which the response to hypotonic shock was studied, the bath solution contained 110 mm NMDG chloride, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, and the osmolarity was adjusted to 303 mOsm with sucrose. The hypotonic bath solution was made as above, maintaining equal ionic strength and pH, except that the osmolarity was adjusted to 228 mOsm with sucrose as assessed using a 5500 Vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Johns Scientific Inc.). Caco-2 cells were subjected to hypotonic shock using a gravity-fed superfusion system. The ClC-2 sense construct was made by directional cloning of the rat (r)ClC-2 open reading frame (kindly provided by T. Jentsch, Hamburg, Germany) with BamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) linkers into the BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites of the eukaryotic vector pCDNA 3.1 (+) (Promega, Madison, WI). The rat ClC-2 sequence shares 77% identity with the human sequence at the nucleotide level. The antisense ClC-2 construct was made by cloning the ClC-2 open reading frame into pCDNA 3.1(−) vector such that the reversed restriction sites on this vector would reverse the orientation of the open reading frame to create the antisense plasmid. The antisense murine ClC-4 construct (Clcn4, a gift from E. Rugarli, Milano, Italy) was made by cloning the ClC-4 open reading frame with BamHI (5′) andEcoRI (3′) into pCDNA 3.1(−). The murine ClC-4 construct shares 73% sequence identity with the human sequence. Caco-2 cells were microinjected with plasmids at day 1 after plating on glass coverslips for patch clamp experiments. In this procedure, the Eppendorf microinjector 5246 system, the micromanipulator 5171 system, and a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope were used. Nuclear microinjection was performed with the Z (depth) limit option, using 0.3-s injection duration and 40–60 hPa injection pressure. Injection femtotips were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries with an internal diameter of 0.5 ± 0.2 μm. Plasmids were diluted to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml for sense ClC-2 plasmids, 50 and 300 μg/ml for antisense ClC-2, and 300 μg/ml antisense ClC-4. The injection buffer contained in 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaOH, 40 mmNaCl, pH 7.4. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (0.5%, Sigma) was also added to the injection medium to identify successfully microinjected cells. For transfection of Caco-2 cells with antisense ClC-2 DNA, the Lipofectin transfection protocol was followed (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, ∼2 × 105 cells were seeded on 35-mm tissue culture plates in culture medium supplemented with serum. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator overnight to allow them to reach 80% confluency (∼106 cells/plate). Two solutions, one containing 2 μg of antisense ClC-2 cDNA (dissolved in serum-free medium) in 100 μl of OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium and the second containing 20 μl of Lipofectin reagent in 100 μl of OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. Following addition of 800 μl of OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium, this transfection mixture was applied to the cells (after washing them with serum-free medium). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h, after which the transfection medium was replaced with normal medium containing 10% serum and antibiotics (as described above). 24 h later, cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis or studied by iodide efflux assay. Short circuit current measurements were performed on Caco-2 cells grown to confluency on Snapwell clear filters, with a surface area of 1.13 cm2 (Corning Costar). The average transepithelial resistance of the cells used was 2421 ± 357.2 Ω cm2. Filters were inserted into Ussing chambers and bathed in a buffer composed of 110.4 mm NaCl, 27.5 mm mannitol, 2.4 mmK2HPO4, 0.8 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm CaCl2, gassed with 95% O2 and heated to 37 °C. After 5–8 min of measuring basal current the apical solution was changed to one lacking (27.5 mm) mannitol for 20% hypotonic shock (HTS; 80% isotonicity; determined using a 5500 Vapor pressure osmometer, Wescor, Johns Scientific Inc.). Caco-2 cells grown on coverslips (80%) were transfected either with antisense ClC-2 plasmid in the pCDNA vector or with vector alone as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Only monolayers possessing 1 × 106 cells after the entire transfection protocol were used for subsequent assays. The transfected cells were iodide loaded according to established methods (14Shen B.Q. Finkbeiner W.E. Wine J.J. Mrsny R.J. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L493-L501PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haws C.M. Nepomuceno I.B. Krouse M.E. Wakelee H. Law T. Xia Y. Nguyen H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1544-C1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a 1-ml Ringers Nitrate loading buffer at pH 7.4 containing 136 mm NaI, 4 mm KNO3, 2 mm CaNO3·4H2O, 2 mmMgNO3·6H2O, 11 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in the above buffer. After this incubation period, the coverslips covered with iodide-loaded cells were washed for a total of 15 s in three separate baths containing Ringers nitrate efflux buffer (110 mm NaNO3, 4 mm KNO3, 2 mmCaNO3·4H2O, 2 mmMgNO3·6H2O, 11 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with the osmolarity adjusted to 300 mOsm with added sucrose. After this washing period, efflux of cellular iodide was assessed continuously after placing the coverslip into an isotonic solution (the above Ringers Nitrate efflux buffer) or hypotonic solutions (osmolarity adjusted 228 mOsm). Iodide efflux (measured as a change in mV) was assessed over a 5-min period, using an iodide sensing electrode (Fisher). Changes in voltage were acquired using the FETCHEX data acquisition program (pCLAMP 6.04, Axon Inst.) and data analyzed using FETCHAN software. Patch clamp measurements are presented as the means ± S.E. Most statistical analyses were performed using the Student's unpaired test. Results obtained in Ussing chamber studies and in Patch clamp studies with hypotonic shock were analyzed using the Student paired test. Differences between two groups were considered significant with p values <0.05. ClC-2 mRNA in Caco-2 cells was detected by Northern blot analysis as a 4.6-kb transcript (Fig. 1 A). This size transcript plus a smaller transcript of ∼3.3 kb in size has been detected in several other tissues and cell lines, as well, including the colonic epithelial cell line T84 (6Schwiebert EM Cid-Soto LP Stafford D Carter M Blaisdell CJ Zeitlin PL Guggino WB Cutting GR Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Immunoblots (Fig. 1 B) using a polyclonal antibody directed against ClC-2 (12Gyomorey K. Yeger H. Ackerley C. Garami E. Bear C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1787-C1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that ClC-2, migrating as a 90–97-kDa protein, is expressed in Caco-2 cells. This signal was competed using the GST-ClC-2 fusion peptide against which the antibody was raised, not GST alone, indicating its specificity for ClC-2. Immunofluorescence labeling using the above antibody suggests that ClC-2 protein localizes to plasma membrane and/or submembranous vesicles in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2). Further, this signal was specific because it was competed using the antigenic peptide described above. Whole cell patch clamp studies were performed to determine whether ClC-2 is functional in the membrane of Caco-2 cells. Because previous studies in heterologous systems showed that ClC-2 expression conferred chloride currents were activated by hyperpolarization and by hypotonic shock (1Thiemann A. Gründer S. Pusch M. Jentsch T. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 11Xiong H. Li C. Garami E. Wang Y. Ramjeesingh M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Gründer S. Thiemann A. Pusch Jentsch T. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), we assessed whether these manipulations could activate ClC-2 endogenously expressed in Caco-2 cell membranes by patch clamp electrophysiology. We functionally isolated anion-dependent currents by using intracellular (pipette) and extracellular (bath) solutions which contained NMDG chloride as the predominant salt. We chose a voltage step protocol that has been used in previously published studies of ClC-2 (11Xiong H. Li C. Garami E. Wang Y. Ramjeesingh M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Gründer S. Thiemann A. Pusch Jentsch T. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Briefly, from a holding potential of −30 mV, the membrane potential was stepped by 20-mV increments from −160 to + 40 mV. Because ClC-2 currents have not been reported to be ATP-dependent and to minimize the contribution by the ATP-dependent, swelling-activated outwardly rectifying chloride channel, volume-sensitive organic osmolyte anion channel (17Bond T. Basavappa S Christensen M. Strange K. J. Gen. Phyiol. 1999; 113: 441-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), MgATP was not included the patch pipette solutions. As shown in Fig. 3(A and C), currents typical of those previously associated with ClC-2 expression, i.e. showing activation with hyperpolarizing voltage steps and an inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship, were detected in Caco-2 cells. At the hyperpolarized membrane potential of −160 mV, these currents had a magnitude of −37 pA/pF ± 0.96 (n = 8). These hyperpolarization-activated currents reversed close to the estimated equilibrium potential of chloride (E Cl = 0 in symmetrical NMDG chloride solutions (Fig. 3 C,circles). As shown in Fig. 3 (B and C), whole cell chloride currents in Caco-2 cell were stimulated by 25% hypotonic shock. We detected an increase in membrane currents from −38 pA/pF to −84 pA/pF within 3–5 min after bath dilution at −160 mV (Fig. 3). The mean current-voltage (I/V) curves of ClC-2 currents before and after application of hypotonic shock reversed close to the chloride equilibrium potential (+5.6 ± 0.47 mV) as shown in Fig.3 C. The average current at −160 mV following hypotonic shock (−65 ± 8 pA/pF) was elevated when compared with currents measured in isotonic condition (−32 ± 2 pA/pF) (p = 0.0208). The I/Vrelationship of the HTS-stimulated chloride currents was less inwardly rectifying than that observed in isotonic solutions (Fig.3 C). A similar change in the I/Vrelationship was observed with HTS in chloride currents specifically conferred by ClC-2 expression in Xenopus oocytes and Sf9 cells and has been attributed to an alteration in the inactivation gate of ClC-2 (11Xiong H. Li C. Garami E. Wang Y. Ramjeesingh M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Gründer S. Thiemann A. Pusch Jentsch T. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These results indicate that native ClC-2 expression at the cell surface of Caco-2 cells is associated with appearance of chloride currents with activation and conductance properties similar to those conferred by ClC-2 expression in heterologous expression systems (1Thiemann A. Gründer S. Pusch M. Jentsch T. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 11Xiong H. Li C. Garami E. Wang Y. Ramjeesingh M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Gründer S. Thiemann A. Pusch Jentsch T. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 18Jordt S.E. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We used an antisense strategy to confirm that the above currents were mediated by ClC-2 because the pharmacological approach lacks specificity. First, we confirmed that transient transfection of ClC-2 antisense cDNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) successfully reduced ClC-2 protein expression by Western analysis of cell lysates from ClC-2 antisense-transfected Caco-2 cells. Using the NIH Imaging Program, we found that there is a 70% decrease in ClC-2 protein quantity in antisense ClC-2 transfected Caco-2 cells relative to control (vector-alone transfected cells). We verified by assessing β-actin expression that differences in protein loading could not account for the decrease in ClC-2 expression in the antisense transfected cells (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, we examined the effects of antisense ClC-2 transfection on immunolabeled ClC-2 detected by fluorescence confocal microscopy. DNA coding for green fluorescence protein (GFP) was cotransfected with antisense ClC-2 (or empty vector as a control) into Caco-2 cells to identify transfected cells (Fig. 4 B). We used an imaging program (Scion Corp.) to compare the ClC-2 immunofluorescence intensity in antisense ClC-2 and in vector transfected Caco-2 cells. We found that the fluorescence intensity of the signal (red) corresponding to membrane expression of ClC-2 was reduced by ∼75% in antisense ClC-2 transfected Caco-2 cells (24.9 units ± 4.3,n = 13, p < 0.0001) relative to the intensity of the ClC-2 signal in mock transfected cells (105.8 units ± 3, n = 10). Immunofluorescence corresponding to expression of ClC-3, a related family member, was not affected by antisense ClC-2 transfection (Fig. 4 C). The signal detected using this ClC-3 antibody in immunofluorescence studies can be competed using the antigenic peptide used to raise the antibody, confirming its specificity (19Shimada K. Li X. Xu G. Nonak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G269-G276Google Scholar). Fig. 4 C shows that the ClC-3 immunofluorescence (red) in antisense ClC-2 and GFP cotransfected Caco-2 cells (106.1 units ± 3.2, n= 20) was similar to that in vector and GFP cotransfected cells (105.9 units ± 2.2, n = 17, p = 0.97). Interestingly, our studies show that unlike ClC-2, immunoreactive ClC-3 appears to be primarily expressed in intracellular membranes, although there is signal detected at the cell surface in a subpopulation of cells. For patch clamp studies, we manipulated ClC-2 expression using intranuclear plasmid injection technique (20Shubeita H.E. Thorburn J.T. Chien K.R. Circulation. 1992; 85: 2238-2241Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Mohammad-Panah R. Demolombe S. Riochet D. Leblais V. Loussouarn G. Pollard H. Baro I. Escande D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C310-C318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because this method permits control of plasmid copy number and hence has greater precision in manipulating the level of antisense expression. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran was coinjected with the plasmid to permit identification of manipulated cells. We found that microinjection of antisense ClC-2 cDNA into Caco-2 cells decreased the ClC-2-like currents in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5, A and B). The negative whole cell current measured at −160 mV decreased from −37 pA/pF ± 1 (n = 8) in uninjected cells to −26 ± 2 pA/pF (n = 5, p = 0.0003) and −12 ± 1 pA/pF (n = 10,p < 0.0001) in 50 and 300 μg/ml antisense ClC-2 cDNA injected cells, respectively (Fig. 5, A andB). To allow direct comparison of current amplitude in ClC-2 antisense injected and uninjected Caco-2 cells, we normalized these currents to the currents at −160 mV in uninjected cells (Fig.5 B). As sho"

We evaluated the capacity of TSP to form inter-platelet cross-bridges through its interaction with fibrinogen (Fg), using either Fg-coated beads or Fg bound to the activated GPIIbIIIa integrin (GPIIbIIIa*) immobilized on beads or on activated fixed platelets (AFP), i.e. in a system free of platelet signaling and secretion mechanisms.

Soluble TSP bound to and induced aggregation of Fg-coated beads dose-dependently, which could be blocked by the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain of TSP, TSP18. Soluble TSP did not bind to GPIIbIIIa*-coated beads or AFP, unless they were preincubated with Fg. The interaction of soluble TSP with Fg-GPIIbIIIa*-coated beads or Fg-AFP resulted in the formation of aggregates via Fg-TSP-Fg cross-bridges, as demonstrated in a system where direct cross-bridges mediated by GPIIbIIIa*-Fg on one particle and free GPIIbIIIa* on a second particle were blocked by the RGD mimetic Ro 44–9883. Soluble TSP increased the efficiency of Fg-mediated aggregation of AFP by 30–110% over all shear rates and GPIIbIIIa* occupancies evaluated. Surprisingly, TSP binding to Fg already bound to its GPIIbIIIa* receptor appears to block the ability of this occupied Fg to recognize another GPIIbIIIa* receptor, but this TSP can indeed cross-bridge to another Fg molecule on a second platelet. Finally, TSP-coated beads could directly coaggregate at shear rates from 100 to 2000 s−1.

Recent studies propose that TSP also interacts with the integrin-associated protein (IAP/CD47) (11Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and functions as a costimulator of platelet integrin GPIIbIIIa and GPIaIIa (25Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A.

Blood. 1999; 94: 642-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A direct role for TSP as a cross-linker of platelets involving TSP/Fg interactions was supported by studies performed with isolated platelet membranes or activated fixed platelets (AFP) bearing Fg (27Agam G. Livne A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 59: 504-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 28Gawaz M. Ott I. Reininger A.J. Heinzmann U. Neumann F.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, in these models, the correlation between numbers of ligands/receptors and kinetics/extent of aggregation was not addressed. Moreover, studies were generally performed under nearly static conditions (29Dixit V.M. Haverstick D.M. O'Rourke K.M. Hennessy S.W. Grant G.A. Santoro S.A. Frazier W.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4270-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or in an aggregometer (27Agam G. Livne A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 59: 504-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), i.e. not representative of the physiological flow environment and shear stresses.In the present study, using well defined in-flow experimental models, free of plasma, red blood cells, platelet signaling, and secretion, we isolated, measured and modelled (i) the capacity of TSP to form and support inter-platelet cross-bridges through its interactions with Fg or with other TSP molecules and (ii) the contribution of TSP-mediated cross-bridges in the aggregation of platelets driven by Fg/GPIIbIIIa* interactions.DISCUSSIONWe studied the involvement of TSP in platelet aggregation through its interaction with Fg bound to its receptor, GPIIbIIIa*. We used model particles, either Fg-beads or Fg-GPIIbIIIa*-beads, or Fg-AFP. These models were chosen to mimic the surface of activated platelets but in the absence of any signaling or secretion process, thereby isolating the cross-bridging functions of TSP while monitoring qualitative and quantitative surface expression of ligands.Soluble TSP induced aggregation of Fg-beads dose-dependently, with a maximal effect observed at 200 nm, and an aggregation efficiency (α) of 14 ± 2.1% at a shear rate of 300 s−1. Aggregation of GPIIbIIIa*-beads by TSP only occurred after preincubation of the beads with Fg. With added Ro 44–9883, the RGD mimetic, to block the cross-bridges between GPIIbIIIa* bound Fg and free GPIIbIIIa*, aggregation occurred through Fg-TSP-Fg cross-bridges with α = 18.1 ± 4.8% at 300 s−1 similar to that obtained with Fg-beads at comparable TSP surface densities (∼30–60 TSP/μm2). This experiment reproduced with AFP gave comparable results; aggregation by TSP at 300 s−1, with added Ro 44–9883, only occurred in the presence of receptor-bound Fg, with α lower than seen for Fg-GPIIbIIIa*-beads, expected for the 10-fold lower density of Fg and TSP in this system. These experiments clearly demonstrate that TSP can induce aggregation of beads or AFP by directly cross-bridging two Fg presented on two particles, at a physiological shear rate (300 s−1). A recombinant fragment encompassing residues 1–174 of TSP, TSP18, previously shown to inhibit the secretion-dependent phase of platelet aggregation (6Legrand C. Morandi V. Mendelovitz S. Shaked H. Hartman J.R. Panet A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited aggregation of Fg-beads by TSP but did not disaggregate the formed aggregates. This is an indication for (i) the involvement of the amino-terminal part of the TSP molecule in TSP-Fg interactions and (ii) a strong TSP-Fg interaction (off-rate very low), as also observed in the binding of FITC-TSP to Fg-GPIIbIIIa*-beads, where TSP18 was not able to displace the bound FITC-TSP but inhibited any further binding of FITC-TSP (results not shown). There are several putative binding sites on Fg and TSP that could stabilize or reinforce their mutual interactions, including three sites on Fg: the Aα 241–476 (4Tuszynski G.P. Srivastava S. Switalska H.I. Holt J.C. Cierniewski C.S. Niewiarowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12240-12245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Aα 113–126 and Bβ 243–252 (5Bacon-Baguley T. Ogilvie M.L. Gartner T.K. Walz D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2317-2323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and at least two sites on TSP: TSP 1–174 (6Legrand C. Morandi V. Mendelovitz S. Shaked H. Hartman J.R. Panet A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), potentially the same as TSP 151–164 (41Voland C. Serre C.M. Delmas P. Clezardin P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and TSP 385–522 (42Lawler J. Chao F.C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12257-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Preincubation of FITC-Fg with TSP did not modify the affinity (K d) nor the maximum binding (Bmax) of FITC-Fg to GPIIbIIIa* immobilized on beads (Fig. 5). This is in accord with the study of Boukerche and McGregor (23Boukerche H. McGregor J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) who showed that a monoclonal antibody anti-TSP (P8) that inhibits platelet aggregation by low doses of thrombin (0.05–0.06 unit/ml) did not affect the dissociation constant of Fg binding to platelets stimulated with ADP (10 μm) or thrombin (0.4 unit/ml). However, Leung (19Leung L.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1764-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) postulated that TSP, by interacting with Fg at a site different from its GPIIbIIIa*-binding site, increases the affinity of Fg for GPIIbIIIa*, thereby stabilizing the aggregates. This assumption, based on the observation that an anti-TSP Fab decreased the affinity of Fg binding to thrombin activated platelets, could rather reflect a steric hampering caused by the Fab bound to TSP, that would disable the closely located Fg/GPIIbIIIa* interactions described by several authors (9Asch A.S. Silbiger S. Heimer E. Nachman R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 43Kieffer N. Nurden A.T. Hasitz M. Titeux M. Breton-Gorius J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 44Kieffer N. Guichard J. Breton-Gorius J. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 57-73PubMed Google Scholar).Surprisingly, our studies suggest that a receptor-bound Fg with attached TSP is no longer capable of interacting with another GPIIbIIIa*, because incubation of Fg-GPIIbIIIa*-beads (0.5% of receptor occupancy) with TSP decreases the aggregation efficiency by ∼30%. In this experiment, we expect that Fg-bound TSP (∼10–15% of receptor-bound Fg contain a TSP molecule) cannot find a counterpart Fg molecule on an adjacent bead because of the low surface density of Fg and TSP molecules (∼200 Fg/bead and ∼25 TSP/bead). This limitation is not encountered by the Fg-GPIIbIIIa* cross-bridging system because ∼39,000 GPIIbIIIa* are available for each Fg on adjacent beads. Using a standard curve reporting the efficiency of GPIIbIIIa*-beads aggregation for varying Fg receptor occupancies, as previously published (34Bonnefoy A. Liu Q. Legrand C. Frojmovic M.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2834-2843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we determined that the aggregation efficiency in the presence of TSP is equivalent to the aggregation efficiency that would be obtained with ∼15% fewer functional Fg on GPIIbIIIa*-beads, closely corresponding to the percentage of Fg occupied by TSP. This hypothesis may explain the “anti-adhesive” property of TSP previously reported in the literature for platelet adhesion to immobilized Fg or fibronectin, after preincubation of these supports with soluble TSP (45Agbanyo F.R. Sixma J.J. de Groot P.G. Languino L.R. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 46Lahav J. Blood. 1988; 71: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results support the idea that the anti-adhesiveness of TSP is induced by the loss of the reactive site on Fg or fibronectin for its platelet receptor, following its occupancy by TSP.Nevertheless, when testing the effect of addition of TSP on the aggregation efficiency of AFP mediated by Fg and GPIIbIIIa*, we found an increase of 30–110% at all Fg receptor occupancies (3–35%) and all shear rates (300–2000 s−1) tested, with 10–15% of receptor-bound Fg decorated by TSP. We expect that TSP-Fg associations on the cell surface would accelerate the kinetics of aggregation (i.e. aggregation efficiency) by (i) increasing the length of the bridges, which will both increase the surface area available for cross-bridging (Fig. 11) and decrease the actual distance required for cell-cell interactions, thereby increasing the collision frequency, (ii) increasing the number of bridges between the platelets, and (iii) concentrating adhesive molecules in multivalent adhesive structures (clusters) that will favor firm platelet to platelet adhesion (see below).In addition to Fg-TSP-Fg interactions, we have shown thatTSP-TSP interactions can also participate in cross-bridging to drive particle aggregation at varying shear rates. The beads coaggregated at all shear rates, with a 10-fold decrease in efficiency for a 10-fold increase in shear rate (100–1000 s−1), similar to the 5-fold decrease previously reported for Fg-mediated aggregation of ADP-activated platelets driven by GPIIbIIIa*-Fg cross-bridges (37Xia Z. Frojmovic M.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 2190-2201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The maximal aggregation efficiency at 300 s−1 (10.4 ± 1.2%) was only two to three times lower than for Fg-mediated aggregation of particles or platelets with surface-bound GPIIbIIIa* (Refs. 34Bonnefoy A. Liu Q. Legrand C. Frojmovic M.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2834-2843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and 37Xia Z. Frojmovic M.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 2190-2201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and this study).Our work demonstrates the direct contribution of TSP in reinforcing the inter-platelet interactions in physiological flow conditions. The participation of TSP is thought to be maximal during the early phase of the platelet secretion process when high concentrations of TSP may accumulate at the contact of activated platelets with Fg already bound to a significant number of GPIIbIIIa*. Expected TSP-mediated cross-bridges are modelled in Fig. 12: The GPIIbIIIa*-Fg-GPIIbIIIa* cross-bridges (Fig.12 A) will cohabitate withGPIIbIIIa*-Fg-TSP-Fg-GPIIbIIIa* cross-bridges (Fig.12 B), with possible participation of TSP (n)interactions (Fig. 12 C). Direct TSP orTSP (n) cross-bridges might also form, involving TSP ligands/receptors other than GPIIbIIIa*-bound Fg CD36, CD47 (? in Fig. 12 D). This latter model may appear controversial because platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombastenia, which lack GPIIbIIIa, have been shown to express normal levels of TSP at the cell surface upon thrombin activation, with no aggregation detected in an aggregometer (23Boukerche H. McGregor J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 47Aiken M.L. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, this apparent contradiction with our model may rather arise from the facts that (i) micro-aggregates of <10 platelets observed in one Glanzmann's thrombastenia patient by phase contrast microscopy may not be detected by aggregometry (48McGregor L. Hanss M. Sayegh A. Calvette J.J. Trzeciak M.C. Ville D. Catimel B. Viala J.J. Dechavanne M. McGregor J.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1989; 62: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and (ii) electron microscopy studies revealed that upon thrombin activation, TSP was not distributed normally on the platelet surface of one Glanzmann's thrombastenia patient, with decreased size and number of TSP clusters (49Hourdille P. Hasitz M. Belloc F. Nurden A.T. Blood. 1985; 65: 912-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that in absence of GPIIbIIIa (and membrane-bound Fg), TSP may not be in an “efficient clustered” conformation to support platelet cross-bridging. Our model of coaggregation of TSP-beads is expected to circumvent these experimental artifacts because (i) our experimental setting detects micro-aggregates as small as doublets and (ii) we used TSP-beads with high TSP-surface density (2347 ± 424 molecules/μm2) that possibly mimic the concentrated TSP found in clusters.Figure 12Model for the participation of TSP in platelet aggregation mediated by Fg-GPIIbIIIa* interactions. In absence of TSP (shaded square), Fg (black bar) directly cross-bridges GPIIbIIIa* (white oval withindentation) molecules on different platelets (A); TSP could form cross-bridges between Fg bound to GPIIbIIIa*, either as a monomer (B) or multimer ofn repeating units (C). TSP -(n)-TSPinteractions could cross-bridging platelets via receptors (black oval) other than Fg bound to GPIIbIIIa* (D). TSP could also participate in macromolecular structures generating inter- and intra-platelet cross-links favoring cluster formation on and between platelets (E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally our model suggests that macromolecular TSP/Fg/GPIIbIIIa* associations could also form, with TSP involved in both inter- and intra-platelet cross-bridges (Fig. 12 E). The physiological relevance of such associations is supported by previous electron microscopy studies showing colocalization of TSP, Fg, CD36, and GPIIbIIIa in clusters on the surface of activated platelets (43Kieffer N. Nurden A.T. Hasitz M. Titeux M. Breton-Gorius J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 44Kieffer N. Guichard J. Breton-Gorius J. Am. J.

Polley M.J. Nachman R.L. Blood. 1985; 66: 926-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A role for TSP has been reported in intra-platelet costimulatory signaling resulting in an enhanced affinity/avidity of GPIIbIIIa (25Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We have additionally demonstrated that TSP also provides an extracellular amplification system of platelet aggregation via inter-platelet cross-bridges possibly involving several molecules on the surface of activated platelets. This amplification system, which is characterized by an acceleration of the platelet aggregation, may be of crucial importance in hemostasis, especially as a platelet colliding with a thrombogenic surface (damaged vessel wall, activated platelet, or endothelium) in flowing blood, is expected to be activated, secrete, and adhere within milliseconds. Further studies will be required to look more precisely at the role of TSP in experimental thrombosis models. It is suggested that henceforth TSP is to be considered as a potential target for developing new antithrombotic drugs, with the aim of preventing undue thrombus growth while minimally affecting primary hemostasis. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP)1represents 20–30% of the glycoproteins stored in human platelet α-granules (1Baenziger N.L. Brodie G.N. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 273-2723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon platelet activation and degranulation, TSP is released, and an important fraction is found associated with the platelet surface (2Phillips D.R. Jennings L.K. Prasanna H.R. J. Biol.

Here we report that the MADS (MCM-1, agamous, deficiens, serum response factor) box transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2D (MEF-2D) acts as the principal conduit for cardiac transcriptional activation by p300. p300 activation of the native 2130-base pair human skeletal α-actin promoter required a single hybrid MEF-2/GATA-4 DNA motif centered at −1256 base pairs.

Coactivators do not bind independently to DNA, but are thought to stabilize the formation of specific transcription factor-DNA complexes and to cause the local unwinding of chromatin directly or by recruitment of histone-remodeling enzymes (1Struhl K.

An important subgroup of coactivators is represented by the closely related transcriptional integrators p300 and cAMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein (CBP).1 These large proteins share extensive sequence homology and many structural features and appear to have arisen as part of an ancestral gene duplication (11Giles R.H.

The cellular levels and activities of p300 and CBP are tightly regulated through steroid, adrenergic, and growth factor signals as well as during the cell cycle (14Snowden A.W. Perkins N.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1947-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Critical roles for p300 and CBP have been identified in growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and tissue-specific gene expression, reflecting their interaction with multiple cellular regulatory proteins (13Giordano A. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A particular requirement for p300 is observed in the heart. Mice deficient in p300 have an embryonic lethal phenotype characterized by failure of cardiac myocyte proliferation and muscle-specific gene expression (10Yao T.P. Oh S.P. Fuchs M. Zhou N.D.

In the postnatal heart, adenovirus E1A selectively inhibits cardiac muscle-specific gene expression by binding to p300 and/or related proteins (15Bishopric N.H. Zeng G.-Q. Sato B. Webster K.A. J.

Although p300 is also required for skeletal muscle gene transcription by the tissue-specific basic helix-loop helix protein MyoD, the heart lacks any equivalent to this transcription factor (18Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The molecular partners and pathways of p300-mediated transcriptional regulation in the heart are not known. Expression of the human skeletal α-actin gene is tightly restricted to striated muscle. In the myocardium, skeletal actin is one of a group of “fetal” genes up-regulated in response to hypertrophic stresses such as pressure overload in vivo, and during the response to adrenergic stimulation, growth factors, and other neurohormonal effectors in cell culture models (19Bishopric N.H.

Regulation of skeletal actin expression in the heart involves both extracellular signal-responsive and cardiac-specific transcription factors; the latter have not yet been identified. The −2130 bp human skeletal actin promoter has two major transcriptional activation domains, proximal (−153 to −87) and distal (−2130 to −710), which are required for maximal tissue-specific expression in both skeletal and cardiac myocytes (19Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter contains functional binding sites for Sp-1, SRF, and TEF-1 (30Taylor A. Erba H.P. Muscat G.E.O. Kedes L. Genomics. 1988; 3: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we report the sequence of the distal human skeletal actin (hSA) promoter, and demonstrate that only one DNA motif within the entire 2130-bp transcriptional unit is capable of transmitting the p300 activation signal. This motif, centered at −1256, binds the MADS (MCM-1, agamous, deficiens, serum response factor) box transcription factor MEF-2 as well as GATA-4, and is required for maximal expression in both neonatal and adult rat cardiac myocytes. The motif also binds endogenous cardiac nuclear p300, and coordinates synergistic activation of the hSA promoter by p300 and MEF-2D. Remarkably, p300-dependent activation did not involve interaction with GATA-4, SRF, or TEF-1, indicating that p300 selectively targets MEF-2 in the context of a native promoter. Based on these findings and on recent data showing interactions between MEF-2 and HDAC-4 (31Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), we propose that MEF-2 governs expression of the cardiac phenotype by acting as a primary channel for chromatin remodeling on cardiac-specific promoters. Expression vectors encoding MEF-2A–D were generously provided by Dr. Eric Olson. A p300 expression vector (pCMVp300β) was the kind gift of Dr. R. Eckner. Polyclonal antibodies against GATA-4, MEF-2, and p300 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal antibody against p300 (NM-11) was supplied by PharMingen, and restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. All other molecular biology reagents were purchased from Sigma except as indicated, and were of the highest grade available. The distal hSA promoter sequence was determined by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI 377 DNA sequencer in the Biochemistry Core Facility, University of California, San Francisco, CA. The resulting information was used to construct skeletal actin promoter-luciferase chimeras. A 2335-bp HindIII genomic fragment containing the hSA promoter sequence, comprising 2130 bp 5′ and 203 bp 3′ to the start of transcription, including all of exon 1, was cloned in sense orientation into the HindIII site of pGL-2Basic (Promega). Truncations and point mutations were generated by cloning and/or PCR-mediated mutagenesis as described (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Primers used for introduction of point mutations are shown in Table I. Mutated bases are shown in bold letters. Numbering reflects the position of hSA gene sequences relative to the transcription start site. Our numbering reflects a systematic difference of +16 bp with the sequence previously published by Muscat et al. (33Muscat G.E. Perry S. Prentice H. Kedes L.

The p1787luc1 plasmid was created by digestion at the hSA SpeI site and the polylinkerNheI site, and re-ligating. p1656 was generated by digestion at the hSA NdeI site and religation of the proximal end to the polylinker BglII site. Digestion with NdeI and partial digestion with XbaI removed a small fragment of 358 bp, resulting in the dNX plasmid. The dNP plasmid was created by double digestion with NdeI and PstI, gel purification of the vector fragment, and religation. Introduction of point mutations to ϕGATA and ATr sites was performed as described (34Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 570-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, two adjacent primers were designed on opposite DNA strands with the mutation encoded at the 5′ end of one primer. Both primers were phosphorylated before PCR. PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to increase fidelity of DNA replication and create blunt-ended PCR products. The amplified plasmid with the introduced mutation was isolated from agarose, religated and transformed to bacteria. Mutations in the proximal promoter were made by directional cloning of double-stranded 52-bp oligomers containing mutations in CArG I (m8, m9), a TEF-1 site (mTEF), or sequences 5′ to the CArG box (m6), flanked by XbaIII and XhoI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The parental pluc1 vector was linearized withXhoI and subjected to partial digestion withXbaIII; each oligonucleotide was then ligated into this vector to generate m6, m8, m9, and mTEF constructs. All clones were screened by restriction analysis and sequenced to confirm the presence of each mutation. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (250–400 g) were premedicated with a mixture of 10–20 mg/kg fluanisone, 0.315–0.630 mg/kg fentanyl citrate (Hypnorm, Jansen Pharmaceuticals), and 0.5–1.0 mg/kg midazolam (Hypnovel, Roche Pharmaceuticals) given intraperitoneally. Animals were ventilated (0.04–0.06 liters/min/kg) on a small animal respirator with 0.5–1.0 cmH2O of positive end-expiratory pressure and maintained under anesthesia with a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen in a 1:1 ratio plus 0.5–1% halothane. The chest was opened by a left thoracotomy and the pericardium removed for DNA injection. DNA was directly injected into the apex of the left ventricle, using 100 μl/injection in a Hamilton syringe (25 μg of internal control plasmid and 50 μg of hSA-luciferase plasmid suspended in phosphate-buffered saline). Postoperative analgesia was administered for at least the next 24 h with 0.2 mg/kg intramuscular buprenorphine (Vetergesic, Reckitt & Coleman). Seven days after surgery, animals were sacrificed with a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium and the heart excised for assays of reporter gene expression. Enzyme determinations in tissue extracts were performed as described previously (35Prentice H. Kloner R.A. Prigozy T. Christensen T. Newman L. Li Y. Kedes L. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1994; 26: 1393-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). pRSV-luciferase and pCAT3PV (SV40 promoter linked to CAT) were used as internal controls and were obtained from PromegaBiotech (Madison, WI). All procedures were performed under license in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines or in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986. HeLa cells were grown in MEM with Eagle's salts, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Neonatal rat myocardial cells were isolated as described previously (19Bishopric N.H. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) by gentle trypsinization and mechanical dissociation over a period of 4–5 h, and plated at a density of 3.5–4 × 106 cells/60-mm culture dish. Cultures were enriched for myocardial cells by preplating for 30–60 min to deplete the population of nonmyocardial cells. Prior to and during transfection, cells were maintained in MEM with Eagle's salts, penicillin, streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum (MEM-FBS). Following transfection, cells were incubated in a serum-free medium consisting of MEM supplemented with insulin, transferrin, vitamin B12, penicillin, and streptomycin (MEM-TIB). All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C and transfected as described below. Cardiac myocytes were transfected with reporter plasmids and other constructs on the day following plating, using an adaptation of the calcium phosphate method (36Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). Equal numbers of myocytes were cotransfected with 10 μg of reporter plasmid and either 5 μg of p300 expression vector, 5 μg of MEF-2 expression plasmid, or an equal amount of blank CMV expression vector. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with MEM-TIB and maintained in that medium for an additional 48 h. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and collected in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega). HeLa and C2C12 cells were transfected at a confluence of 50–70%, also using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were maintained prior and during transfection in MEM (HeLa) or DMEM (C2C12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. On the day after transfection, cells were rinsed twice with fresh media and incubated for 24–48 h before harvesting as described above. A commercially available kit was used to measure luciferase activity in cell lysates (Promega). For preparation of nuclear extracts, cardiac myocytes were plated in 10-cm dishes and cultured in MEM-FBS for 2 days, then switched to MEM-TIB for 3–5 days. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar), except that the final extract was desalted on a 1–2-ml Sephadex G-25 chromatography mini-column instead of by dialysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Aliquots of nuclear extract were frozen and stored at −80 °C. Double-stranded oligonucleotide gel shift probes containing the wild-type and mutant ϕGATA and ATr motifs were synthesized as shown in Table II. Gel-purified oligonucleotide pairs were annealed and end-labeled with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (38Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) (69). In brief, equal amounts of radioactive probe (1.5–2.5 × 104 cpm) were added to binding reactions that contained 6 μg of nuclear extract protein in 20 μl of a buffer containing 4 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 22 °C and then separated on a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. Where indicated, antibodies (2–4 μg/reaction) were incubated with the binding reactions for 30 min at 22 °C before addition of the probe. For determination of sequence-specific binding, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added immediately before the probe. No DNA-antibody interaction was observed in the absence of nuclear protein (data not shown).Table IIOligonucleotides used in EMSA assaysNameSequenceϕGATA-sense5′-ATCCTCACCGGATAGACCCTATAC-3′ϕGATA-antisense5′-GTATAGGGTCTATCCGGTGAGGAT-3′ϕGATA-mutant-sense5′-ATCCTCACCAGATCTACCCTATAC-3′ϕGATA-mutant-antisense5′-CTATAGGGTAGATCTGGTGAGGAT-3′ATr-sense5′-CATATATCAGTGATATAAATAGAACCTGCA-3′ATr-antisense5′-TGCAGGTTCTATTTATATCACTGATATATG-3′ATr-mutant-sense5′-CATATATCAGTGCTAGCAATAGAACCTGCA-3′ATr-mutant-antisense5′-TGCAGGTTCTATTGCTAGCACTGATATATG-3′α-MHC-ATr sense5′-GTAAGGGATATTTTTGCTTCACTTT-3′α-MHC-ATr antisense5′-AAAGTGAAGCAAAAATATCCCTTAC-3′MCK-ATr sense2-aMCK, muscle creative kinase.5′-GCTCTAAAAATAACCCTG-3′MCK-ATr antisense5′-CAGGGTTATTTTTAGAGC-3′hSA-SRE sense5′-CCAACACCCAAATATGG-3′hSA-SRE antisense5′-GGTTGTGGGTTTATACC-3′2-a MCK, muscle creative kinase. Open table in a new tab 50 μg of nuclear extract from cardiac myocytes (prepared as described above) was mixed in equal amounts with 2× immunoprecipitation buffer (2% Triton X-100, 300 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0% Nonidet P-40). Subsequently, 1–5 μg of either MEF-2 or p300 antibody was added. Mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. with constant agitation. Protein A-agarose (20 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added to the protein-antibody mixture, and tubes were incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, agarose beads were spun down, and the supernatant was reserved to quantitate unbound proteins. Beads were washed three times with 1× immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), resuspended in 30 ml of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol) and then boiled for 5 min. Aliquots of the original nuclear extract, unbound proteins, and wash fractions were also mixed with 2× electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled. All protein samples were resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (for p300) or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide (for detection of MEF-2 proteins). Gels were transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes using a Transblot electrophoresis transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with polyclonal MEF-2 antibody (SC-313, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal p300 (N-15) (sc-584, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and monoclonal p300 NM11 (14991A, PharMingen). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). A biotinylated oligonucleotide containing the antisense ATr motif (5′-biotin-TTACCAGAGCCTGCTGCAGGTTCTATTTATATCA-3′) was annealed to the complementary ATr (R) sense oligonucleotide (see Fig.7 A) at a final concentration of 10 μm and linked to Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY) as described previously (39Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For coprecipitation of MEF-2 and p300, the beads were initially washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and twice with a buffer containing 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA (TE-NaCl, pH 7.5). The beads were then mixed with 10 pmol of double-stranded biotinylated probe and incubated 20 min at room temperature in TE-NaCl. Sequential washes with TE-NaCl and 1× binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.3% Nonidet P-40) were used to remove excess unbound oligonucleotide and to equilibrate the beads with the binding buffer. Cardiac myocyte nuclear extract (50 μg) was mixed with 1× binding buffer for 5 min at room temperature and incubated with the probe-linked beads for 20 min. Unbound proteins were washed from the beads three times with 1× buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and aliquots of each wash were retained for analysis. Finally, proteins specifically bound to the beads were eluted with 1× binding buffer containing 1 m NaCl. All fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE (6% for p300 and 12% for MEF-2) and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies to p300 and MEF-2 as described above. p300/CBP does not bind DNA directly, but is recruited to specific gene control regions by transcription factors that bind to these sites. Thus, we looked for binding sites for known DNA-binding transcription factors in the hSA promoter that could represent partners or mediators of p300-dependent transactivation. The proximal human skeletal actin promoter contains consensus binding sites for SRF, TEF-1, and Sp-1, similar to the chick, mouse, and rat skeletal actin promoters (Refs. 41Abraham S.E. Lobo S. Yaciuk P. Wang H.G. Moran E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar, 35Prentice H. Kloner R.A. Prigozy T. Christensen T. Newman L. Li Y. Kedes L. J. Mol.

Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To characterize these elements, we sequenced the distal human skeletal actin promoter from −710 to −2130 (data not shown). Within this sequence are two DNA elements resembling AP-1 binding sites (centered at −1494 and −1300, Fig. 1 A), as well as six variant E-boxes (CANNTG; data not shown). A previously described AT-rich motif was found centered at −1256 (33Muscat G.E. Perry S. Prentice H. Kedes L. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 111-126PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A andC). This AT-rich site differs by one nucleotide from the consensus binding site for MEF-2 (CTA(A/T)4TAG; Ref. 40Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). We also searched for GATA binding sites by BLAST screening of the hSA promoter with the GATA binding site from the brain natriuretic peptide promoter (CTGATAAATCAGAGATAACC). This search revealed two potential GATA binding sites, one of which overlapped with the MEF-2 consensus sequence. For convenience, the compound MEF-2/GATA binding motif was called “ATr.” An additional putative GATA site was centered at − 1798 (Fig. 1, A and C) and designated ϕGATA. To test the functional relevance of these elements, the hSA promoter was subjected to serial 5′ truncations and point mutagenesis (Fig. 1,B and C). The resulting constructs were assayed for activity in adult myocardium"

FcRn enters these cells by endocytosis and is present on the apical and basolateral surfaces. We investigated the roles of aromatic amino acids and a dileucine motif in the cytoplasmic domain of rat FcRn. We expressed mutant FcRn in which alanine replaced Trp-311, Leu-322, and Leu-323, or Phe-340 in the inner medullary collecting duct cell line IMCD. Individual replacement of the aromatic amino acids or the dileucine motif only partially blocked endocytosis of 125I-Fc, whereas uptake by FcRn containing alanine residues in place of both Trp-311 and the dileucine motif was reduced to the level obtained with the tailless receptor. Leu-314 was required for the function of the tryptophan-based endocytosis signal, and Asp-317 and Asp-318 were required for the dileucine-based signal. Nonvectorial delivery of newly synthesized FcRn to the two cell surfaces was unaffected by loss of the endocytosis signals. However, the steady-state distribution of endocytosis mutants was predominantly apical, unlike wild-type FcRn, which was predominantly basolateral. This shift appeared to arise because the loss of endocytosis signals inhibited apical to basolateral transcytosis of FcRn more than basolateral to apical transcytosis.

Mostov K.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) carries IgG into a vesicular pathway across epithelia. In this way FcRn protects from degradation much of the IgG that enters epithelia by endocytosis. Such protection is necessary for two physiological processes: the transmission of IgG from mother to offspring, and the protection from catabolism of IgG entering and leaving the blood circulation. This necessity is illustrated by the low serum IgG concentration in the first days after birth (2Israel E.J. Patel V.K. Taylor S.F. Marshak-Rothstein A. Simister N.E. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6246-6251PubMed Google Scholar), the failure to obtain IgG by suckling (2Israel E.J. Patel V.K. Taylor S.F. Marshak-Rothstein A. Simister N.E. J.

Medesan C. Antohe F. Radu C. Simionescu M. Ghetie V. Ward E.S. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 1289-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) appears responsible for protection from catabolism. In intestinal epithelial cells from neonatal rats, less than 10% of FcRn is on the cell surface; most is intracellular (14Berryman M. Rodewald R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2347-2360PubMed Google Scholar). Both FcRn and IgG enter these cells at coated pits in the plasma membrane and are delivered to tubular and vacuolar structures that appear to be endosomes (14Berryman M. Rodewald R. J.

IgG can also cross isolated intestinal segments at neutral pH (21Benlounes N. Chedid R. Thuillier F. Desjeux J.F. Rousselet F. Heyman M. Biol. Neonate. 1995; 67: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which is unfavorable for its binding to FcRn (17Rodewald R. J.

Under these conditions IgG may enter epithelial cells in the fluid phase and bind FcRn only after delivery to acidified endosomes (21Benlounes N. Chedid R. Thuillier F. Desjeux J.F. Rousselet F. Heyman M. Biol. Neonate. 1995; 67: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Likewise, IgG may enter yolk sac endoderm (7Roberts D.M. Guenthert M. Rodewald R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), syncytiotrophoblast (22Leach L. Eaton B.M. Firth J.A. Contractor S.F. Histochem.

Immunology. 1996; 89: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) in the fluid phase at neutral pH before binding FcRn in endosomes. It is probable that an endocytic pathway analogous to that in the neonatal intestinal epithelium delivers FcRn to endosomes even in tissues in which IgG does not bind the receptor at the plasma membrane (although there may also be a direct route from the trans Golgi network). Consistent with this, there is some FcRn on the plasma membrane of the yolk sac endoderm (R. Rodewald personal communication cited in Ref.24Meads T.J. Wild A.E. Placenta. 1994; 15: 525-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), although almost all is intracellular (7Roberts D.M. Guenthert M. Rodewald R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The signals known to direct receptors and other membrane proteins to undergo endocytosis at coated pits are almost all in the cytoplasmic domains (for review, see Ref. 25Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The majority of these signals are tyrosine-based motifs and dileucine-based motifs (for review, see Refs.25Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar and 26Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A few endocytosis signals contain phenylalanine residues (e.g. in bovine cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (27Johnson K.F. Chan W. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10010-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) or tolerate substitution of phenylalanine for tyrosine (e.g. in bovine cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (28Canfield W.M. Johnson K.F. Ye R.D. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5682-5688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)); none is reported to contain tryptophan, although tyrosine residues in the endocytosis signals of the human low density lipoprotein receptor (29Davis C.G. van Driel I.R. Russel D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4075-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human transferrin receptor (30McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) can be replaced by tryptophan without loss of function. Amino acid sequences overlapping some but not all endocytosis signals are used additionally to target membrane proteins to the basolateral surfaces of polarized cells (for review, see Ref. 31Mostov K.E. Cardone M.H. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The α chain of rat FcRn has a 44-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (1Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), which includes the dileucine motif Leu-322, Leu-323. There is no tyrosine, but there are two aromatic amino acid residues in this region, Trp-311 and Phe-340. It has recently been reported that in a chimeric protein comprising the extracellular and transmembrane regions of mouse FcγRII-B2 fused to the membrane-proximal 24 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of rat FcRn, expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, the dileucine motif is an endocytosis signal, but not a basolateral targeting signal (32Stefaner I. Praetor A. Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8998-9005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our goal in this study was to examine the roles in endocytosis of Trp-311 and Phe-340 as well as Leu-322 and Leu-323, in full-length rat FcRn in a rat kidney cell line (33McCarthy K.M. Yoong Y. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1277-1285PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined the effects of these amino acids on the distribution of FcRn between the apical and basolateral cell surfaces. Rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells and their transfected derivatives were cultured as described previously (33McCarthy K.M. Yoong Y. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1277-1285PubMed Google Scholar). Except where noted, cells were plated on 24-mm Transwells (polycarbonate, 3-μm pores; Corning Costar, Acton, MA) and grown for 3–6 days before experiments to allow a polarized monolayer with resistance greater than 300 Ωcm2 to form (33McCarthy K.M. Yoong Y. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1277-1285PubMed Google Scholar). Codons were substituted for those encoding Leu-307, Pro-308, Ala-309, Pro-310, Trp-311, Leu-312, Ser-313, Leu-314, Ser-315, Asp-317, Asp-318, Ser-319, Gly-320, Asp-321, Leu-322, Leu-323, and Phe-340 individually or in combination using overlap exchange polymerase chain reaction (34Higuchi R.

All sequences were verified. DNAs that coded for mutant and wild-type rat FcRn α chains were subcloned into the expression vector pRc/RSV (neomycin resistance, Invitrogen, San Diego). IMCD cells were transfected with each construct, using a calcium phosphate method (36Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar). Cells resistant to G418 were selected, and individual colonies were expanded to establish cell lines. In some experiments IMCD cells were used which expressed essentially tailless FcRn, truncated after Arg-304 (304t). 2McCarthy, K. M., Lam, M., Subramanian, L., Shakya, R., Wu, Z., Newton, E. E., and Simister, N. E., J. Cell Sci., in press. Western blots were used to look for FcRn expression in clones, essentially as described (9Simister N.E. Story C.M. Chen H.-L. Hunt J.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 1% SDS. Lysates containing 15 μg of protein were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide denaturing gels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Novex, San Diego). Blots were probed with purified rabbit antibodies against amino acids 176–190 of rat FcRn (33McCarthy K.M. Yoong Y. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1277-1285PubMed Google Scholar), diluted 1:150 (∼5 μg/ml). Bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) and Renaissance Chemiluminescence Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The Fc fragment of human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) was labeled with Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using IODO-GEN (Pierce Chemical Co.). The Fc fragment of human IgG binds rat FcRn as effectively as rat Fc (37Wallace K.H. Rees A.R. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cells were cooled on ice and washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) pH 6.0 at the loading surface (apical or basolateral) and pH 8.0 at the nonloading surface. 125I-Fc (100 ng/ml, 2 × 10−9m, iodinated to 0.8 mCi/μmol) in ice-cold DMEM, 1 mm KI, 1.5% fish gelatin (Sigma), 20 mm HEPES (DMEM-KIGH) pH 6.0 was then added to the loading surface with or without 5 mg/ml unlabeled human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, 3.3 × 10−5m). The cells were allowed to bind 125I-Fc for 6 h at 4 °C. Radioactivity in the nonloading compartment was measured in a CliniGamma 1272 gamma counter (LKB Wallac, Piscataway, NJ), and wells in which more than 1% of the applied125I-Fc had crossed the monolayer were rejected. Cells were rapidly washed five times with ice-cold DMEM pH 6.0 at the loading surface and pH 8.0 at the nonloading surface. Lastly, the filters were cut from the Transwells, and cell-associated 125I-Fc was measured. Specific binding to each surface of each cell line was calculated as the difference between the cell-associated radioactivity in the absence and presence of unlabeled IgG, and the mean amounts of125I-Fc specifically bound at the apical and basolateral surfaces were represented as percentages of their sum. Cells were grown on 12-well plates until nearly confluent but still fibroblast-like in appearance. The cells were cooled on ice for 1 h, washed twice with ice-cold DMEM pH 6.0, and allowed to bind 125I-Fc (100 ng/ml) in DMEM-KIGH pH 6.0 for 6 h. After the cells were washed four times with ice-cold DMEM pH 6.0, they were incubated at 37 °C with prewarmed DMEM-KIGH pH 6.0 for 0, 2, 5, 15, and 30 min. Then the cells were cooled on ice, and the medium was removed and counted (cpmmed). The cells were washed with ice-cold DMEM pH 6.0 and then incubated on ice for 45 min with chymotrypsin and proteinase K, 50 μg/ml each in phosphate-buffered saline pH 8.0 to digest125I-Fc from the cell surface (cpmsurf). Finally, the cells were washed with ice-cold DMEM pH 8.0 and then dissolved in 0.1 m NaOH and counted (cpmint). For each time point of each cell line, the percentage of125I-Fc internalized was calculated as cpmint× 100/(cpmmed + cpmsurf + cpmint). Because the signal obtained by loading at 4 °C was low, uptake of 125I-Fc from the apical and basolateral surfaces was measured by loading briefly at 37 °C. After each surface was washed twice with DMEM pH 8.0, the cells were cooled on ice. Cells were pulsed for 5 min at 37 °C with125I-Fc (100 ng/ml) in DMEM-KIGH pH 6.0 at either the apical or basolateral (loading) surface, and DMEM pH 6.0 at the opposite (nonloading) surface. Immediately the cells were washed five times with ice-cold DMEM pH 6.0 and then proteins were digested at both cell surfaces as in the uptake assay above. Proteins released from the loading and nonloading surfaces were collected, and 125I-Fc was counted (cpmloading and cpmnonloading, respectively). Each Transwell filter was cut out, and cell-associated radioactivity was counted (cpmint). The fraction of125I-Fc internalized was calculated as (cpmint+ cpmnonloading)/(cpmloading + cpmnonloading + cpmint) and was expressed as a percentage of the fraction taken up by wild-type FcRn. To measure the steady-state distribution of FcRn between the apical and basolateral cell surfaces, the apical, basolateral, or both surfaces were treated with sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido) ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (NHS-SS-biotin, Pierce), twice for 15 min on ice, essentially as published (38Okamoto C.T. Shia S.P. Bird C. Mostov K.E. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9925-9932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the biotinylation was quenched with DMEM, the filters were cut from the Transwells (three for each surface). The cells were lysed and precipitated with rabbit anti-rat FcRn α-chain and protein A-trisacryl and then with streptavidin-agarose essentially as described (33McCarthy K.M. Yoong Y. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1277-1285PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted from streptavidin-agarose into reducing sample buffer, pooled from each set of three Transwells, and resolved on 8% polyacrylamide denaturing gels. Gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and FcRn was detected with antipeptide antibodies as above. The FcRn α chain bands (upper and lower bands in Fig. 6) were quantified using a Gel Doc 1000 work station and Molecular Analyst 2.1.1 software (Bio-Rad). To measure the delivery of newly synthesized FcRn to the apical and basolateral cell surfaces, cells were washed twice with Met–, Cys– DMEM, starved in the same medium for 45 min at 37 °C, and then labeled for 15 min with 0.5 mCi/ml 35S-labeled Met+Cys (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the basolateral compartment. After 0, 30, 90, and 210 min of chase in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2and 0.5 mm MgCl2, cooled on ice for 1 h, then biotinylated on either the apical or basolateral surface (three Transwells each) twice for 30 min, as above. The cells were lysed and precipitated with anti-FcRn and then with streptavidin-agarose as above. Proteins were eluted, pooled, and subjected to electrophoresis as above. Gels were incubated in 1 m sodium salicylate for 20 min at room temperature and dried. 35S-Labeled proteins were detected using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). 125I-Fc was allowed to bind the loading surface (apical or basolateral) as in the Fc binding assay, above. The loading and nonloading surfaces were then washed five times each with ice-cold DMEM-KIGH pH 6.0 and pH 8.0, respectively. The nonloading surface medium was counted (cpm0) and replaced with DMEM-KIGH pH 8.0, prewarmed to 37 °C. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 0, 2, 7, 22, and 52 min, after which times the medium from the nonloading surface was removed and counted (cpm2, cpm7, etc.) and replaced with fresh DMEM pH 8.0. At the last time point, the loading surface medium was counted (cpmmedium), and the Transwell membrane was cut out and cell-associated radioactivity counted (cpmcell). For each well at each time point (t), the cumulative percentage of125I-Fc transported was calculated as (cpm0 + cpm2 + … + cpmt) × 100/(cpm0 + cpm2 + cpm7 + cpm22 + cpm52 + cpmmedium + cpmcell). To test whether the dileucine motif and aromatic amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of rat FcRn were required for endocytosis and basolateral targeting we expressed in IMCD cells FcRn α chains with alanine replacing Trp-311, Leu-322 plus Leu-323, and Phe-340, individually or combination (Fig.1). Fig. 2 shows a Western blot of extracts of cell lines selected for high and fairly uniform levels of expression of the mutant forms FcRn. Purified anti-peptide antibodies against rat FcRn α chain (33McCarthy K.M. Yoong Y. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1277-1285PubMed Google Scholar) typically reveal two bands, as here, when FcRn is expressed in either IMCD cells (33McCarthy K.M. Yoong Y. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1277-1285PubMed Google Scholar) or Rat1 fibroblasts. In Rat1 cells, both bands migrate with the same decreased apparent molecular weight after digestion with peptide N-glycosidase F; the lower band is also shifted by endoglycosidase H treatment, but the upper band is resistant.2 These data suggest that the lower band is the high mannose form of FcRn usually found in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas FcRn in the upper band contains complex-type oligosaccharide chains modified in the Golgi. Consistent with this interpretation, the upper band is greatly enriched at the cell surface compared with the lower band (see Fig. 6). We confirmed that all of the IMCD cell lines expressing these and other mutant forms of FcRn could bind 125I-Fc (below). We first compared the uptake of Fc by subconfluent, nonpolarized IMCD cells expressing wild-type and mutant FcRn α chains. We allowed cells to bind 125I-Fc at 4 °C and measured uptake when they were warmed to 37 °C. Cells expressing wild-type FcRn and the tailless truncation 304t were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Replacement with alanine of Trp-311, of Leu-322 and Leu-323, or of Phe-340 (open squares, open triangles, and open circles, respectively, in Fig. 3 A) decreased the amount of Fc taken up in 30 min by 5–25% compared with wild-type FcRn (closed triangles). Likewise, simultaneous substitution of Trp-311 and Phe-340 or of Leu-322, Leu-323 and Phe-340 resulted in only a small impairment of endocytosis. The initial rates of endocytosis by W311A (open squares) and L322A/L323A/F340A (open diamonds) were, respectively, 55 and 65% lower than for wild-type FcRn, although both took up near wild-type amounts of Fc over 30 min. In contrast, endocytosis by FcRn containing alanine residues in place of Trp-311, Leu-322, and Leu-323 was decreased by 80% (closed squares), somewhat more than uptake by the tailless receptor (closed circles). Furthermore, the rates of endocytosis by W311A/L322A/L323A and tailless FcRn were both less than 10% of that obtained with the wild-type receptor. Similar results were obtained with Rat1 cells expressing these mutants (data not shown). These results suggested that in nonpolarized cells Trp-311 and the dileucine motif were components of independent endocytosis signals. We next measured uptake from the apical and basolateral surfaces of polarized IMCD cells to determine whether either endocytosis signal was used preferentially at one or the other surface. We allowed cells to take up 125I-Fc from the apical or basal medium for 5 min at 37 °C. Disruption of either signal alone reduced endocytosis by less than 25% (Fig. 3 B); disruption of both signals reduced apical endocytosis by 75% and basolateral endocytosis by 50%. We explored the sequence requirements of the tryptophan-based endocytosis signal by alanine-scanning and additional substitutions, in the context of a disrupted dileucine motif. Again we used subconfluent, nonpolarized IMCD cells. Replacement of Trp-311 with tyrosine (open circles in Fig.4 A) or phenylalanine (open triangles) allowed endocytosis of Fc at levels similar to or only slightly below those obtained with wild-type FcRn (closed triangles). However, the rate of endocytosis by W311F/L322A/L323A was only 35% of that seen with the wild-type receptor. Mutations in positions 307, 308, 309, 310, 312, 313, and 315 had little or no effect on the extent of Fc uptake (Fig.4 B), although uptake by S315A/L322A/L323A (open diamonds) was 35% slower than by wild-type FcRn. Substitution of isoleucine for Leu-314 was without effect on the amount of Fc taken up (open circles in Fig. 4 C) but decreased the rate of endocytosis by 65%. In contrast, substitution with alanine (closed circles) decreased endocytosis to the level and rate of tailless FcRn. Similarly, we measured endocytosis by FcRn with mutations in the vicinity of the dileucine motif in the context of a disrupted tryptophan-based signal. Mutations in positions 315, 319, 320, and 321 had little or no effect on Fc uptake (Fig. 4 D), although replacement of Ser-315A reduced the rate of uptake by 25% (open triangles). In contrast, substitution of alanine residues for Asp-317 and Asp-318 (open diamonds) reduced the rate of uptake by 90% and amount of Fc taken up by 60%, compared with wild-type FcRn. We used two types of assay to measure the steady-state distribution of FcRn mutants between the apical and basolateral surfaces of polarized IMCD cells, one based on ligand binding and the other on biotinylation. In both assays we used cells grown on Transwell filters for 3 days after they had become confluent. We have shown previously that these conditions allow the cells to become polarized (33McCarthy K.M. Yoong Y. Simister N.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1277-1285PubMed Google Scholar). First we measured the binding of 125I-Fc from the apical or basal compartment at 4 °C. Fig. 5, which summarizes data from 3–10 experiments on each mutant, shows the specific binding to the apical and basolateral surfaces (calculated as the radioligand competed off by unlabeled IgG) as percentages of the total specific binding. In IMCD cells expressing wild-type FcRn we detected ∼75% of the cell surface FcRn on the basolateral plasma membrane. We found similar percentages of the FcRn mutants W311A, L322A/L323A, F340A, W311A/F340A, and L322A/L323A/F340A at the basolateral surface. Strikingly, the distribution of FcRn with alanine replacing both Trp-311 and the dileucine motif (W311A/L322A/L323A) was reversed, with only 30% on the basolateral membrane. The distribution of the tailless FcRn 304t was intermediate between the wild-type and W311A/L322A/L323A receptors, with ∼45% on the basolateral surface. We used surface-specific biotinylation as an independent measure of the steady-state distribution of the W311A/L322A/L323A FcRn mutant. We found that 65% of the wild-type FcRn was biotinylated at the basolateral surface (Fig. 6). The distribution of FcRn with alanine replacing both Trp-311 and the dileucine motif was again reversed, with less than 5% at the basolateral plasma membrane. We detected 35% of the tailless FcRn at the basolateral surface. Using the domain-specific binding assay we compared the distributions of FcRn with mutations close to Trp-311 in the context of the L322A/L323A mutation and mutations near the dileucine motif in the context of W311A. L314A/L322A/L323A and W311A/D317A/D318A, which were impaired in endocytosis, were predominantly apical (Fig.7). Mutants that showed normal endocytosis were found"

Abnormal expression of p53 is felt to be an early event in mammary carcinogenesis. We developed an in vitro model of early breast cancer prevention to investigate how tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen may act in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) that have acutely lost p53 function. p53 function was suppressed by retrovirally mediated expression of the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 protein. Tamoxifen, but not 4-hydroxytamoxifen, rapidly induced apoptosis in p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells as evidenced by characteristic morphologic changes, annexin V binding, and DNA fragmentation. We observed that a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial condensation, and caspase activation preceded the morphologic appearance of apoptosis in tamoxifen-treated early passage p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells. p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells rapidly developed resistance to tamoxifen-mediated apoptosis within 10 passages in vitro. Resistance to tamoxifen in late passage p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells correlated with an increase in mitochondrial mass and a lack of mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation following tamoxifen treatment. We hypothesize that an early event in the induction of apoptosis by tamoxifen involves mitochondrial depolarization and caspase activation, and this may be important for effective chemoprevention.

Wylie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12616) Google Scholar). Deregulated apoptotic signaling is felt to contribute to human cancer and autoimmune disorders (2Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar, 3Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6162) Google Scholar). Chemotherapeutic agents are also felt to exert many of their cytotoxic effects by induction of apoptosis, and chemotherapy resistance frequently correlates with resistance to apoptotic signaling (4Saikumar P. Dong Z. Mikhailov V. Denton M. Weinberg J. Venkatachalam M. Am. J. Med. 1999; 107: 489-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is morphologically characterized by specific structural changes including margination of chromatin, nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, and formation of apoptotic bodies (5Manjo G. Joris I. Am J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). There is much evidence that apoptotic signaling activates highly regulated and specific proteolysis mediated by caspases (6Wolfe B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Caspases are a highly conserved family of aspartic acid-specific proteases that are synthesized as zymogens and are converted to active heterodimers by proteolytic cleavage (7Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvensen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2124) Google Scholar, 8Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Activated caspases are thought to be responsible, in part, for cellular changes that occur during the execution phase of apoptosis such as DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and formation of apoptotic bodies (9Thornberry N.A. Lazebrik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence supports a cascade model for effector caspase activation; a proapoptotic signal culminates in release of mitochondrial cytochromec, resulting in activation of initiator caspases that, in turn, activate effector caspases, resulting in cellular disassembly (9Thornberry N.A. Lazebrik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that mitochondria play a central role in apoptosis as integrators of cellular apoptotic signal transduction and in amplification of the apoptotic response (10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of mitochondrial electron transport and energy metabolism is recognized as an early event in apoptosis and precedes the appearance of morphologic changes characteristic of apoptosis (10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial dysfunction is characterized by an increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability and loss of membrane potential (ΔΨm). Associated with this decrease in ΔΨm, cytochrome c is translocated from the intermembrane compartment of the mitochondria to the cytosol. Cytosolic cytochrome c forms an essential part of the “apoptosome,” composed of cytochrome c, Apaf-1, and procaspase-9 (11Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahamad M. Alemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91 (489): 497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (6157) Google Scholar). This results in activation of procaspase-9 and that, in turn, activates other caspases, such as caspase-3, to orchestrate the execution phase of apoptosis (10Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The estrogen agonist/antagonist tamoxifen is a triphenylethylene that has been shown to act as both a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer and, more recently, as a breast cancer chemoprevention agent. The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial demonstrated a 45% reduction in breast cancer incidence among the participants who took tamoxifen, 6 years after its inception (12Fisher B. Constantino J.P. Wickerham C.D.L. Redmond C.K. Kavanah M. Cronin W.M. Vogel V. Robidoux A. Dimitrov N. Atkins J. Daly M. Wieand S. Tan-Chiu E. Ford L. Wolmark N. Other National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Investigators J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1371-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar). This was the first study to demonstrate that a chemopreventive agent could reduce the incidence of breast cancer. However, many questions surround the results from the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. 1) Did “true” chemoprevention occur or were the benefits of tamoxifen due to ablation of preclinical breast cancer? 2) Tamoxifen has been shown to induce both growth arrest and apoptosis (13Kyprianou N. English H.F. Davidson N.E. Issacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 162-166PubMed Google Scholar, 14Brunner N. Bronzert D. Vindelov L.L. Rygaard K. Spang-Thomsen M. Lippman M.E.

Did tamoxifen act as a cytostatic or cytotoxic agent in the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial? p53 is a critical regulator of cell cycle control, and the high frequency with which p53 is functionally inactivated in early human breast cancer attests to its key role in preventing mammary carcinogenesis (16Hansen R. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17Harris C.C. Hollstein M. N. Engl. J.

Approximately 50% of all primary node-negative breast cancers have deleted or mutated p53, and individuals with germ line heterozygous mutations in p53, or Li-Fraumeni's syndrome, demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer (19Barbareschi M. Leonardi E. Mauri F.A. Serio G. Dalla Palma P. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1992; 98 (218): 408Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Levesque M.A., Yu, H. Clark G.M. Diamandis E.P. J. Clin.

Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2187-2197PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, aberrant expression of p53 in mammary epithelial cells is a predictor of risk for the subsequent development of breast cancer. 1) The accumulation of p53 protein (but not c-ErbB-2) in benign breast lesions is a significant predictor for the subsequent development of breast cancer (22Fabian C.J. Kamel S. Zalles C. Kimmler B.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 25: 112-122Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Rohan T.E. Hartwick W. Miller A.B. Kandel R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1262-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 2) p53 protein is frequently overexpressed (36%) in benign mammary epithelial cells obtained from high risk women but not observed (0%) in low risk women (22Fabian C.J. Kamel S. Zalles C. Kimmler B.F. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 25: 112-122Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 3) Aberrant expression of p53 in the setting of mammary hyperplasia is a significant predictor of the subsequent development of breast cancer in high risk women (23Rohan T.E. Hartwick W. Miller A.B. Kandel R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1262-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that loss of p53 function may be an early event in breast carcinogenesis. Although abnormal expression of p53 predicts a poor response to tamoxifen chemotherapy, little is known about the fate of normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs)1 that acutely lose p53 function during tamoxifen chemoprevention. We sought to model tamoxifen chemoprevention in normal HMECs that have acutely lost p53 function. p53 function was suppressed utilizing retrovirally mediated introduction of human papilloma type 16 (HPV-16) E6 protein (24Demers G.W. Espling E. Harry J.B. Etscheid B.G. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6862-6869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The E6 protein of the cancer-associated HPV-16 binds to p53 and targets it for degradation through the ubiquitin pathway (25Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3410) Google Scholar, 26Werness B.A. Levine J.A. Howley P.M.

Tamoxifen is extensively metabolized in vivo, producing demethylated and hydroxylated derivatives that can be detected in patients receiving tamoxifen treatment (27Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res.

The major metabolites of tamoxifen are felt to be 4-hydroxytamoxifen andN-demethyltamoxifen (27Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1982; 2: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Whereas certain metabolites are biologically inactive, 4-hydroxytamoxifen has a higher affinity for the estrogen receptor than tamoxifen in vitro (18Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7400) Google Scholar, 30Robertson D.W. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Long D.J. Rorke E.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1982; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The ability of tamoxifen to inhibit proliferation has been extensively studied. However, the molecular mechanism by which tamoxifen initiates apoptosis is poorly understood. We sought to investigate whether tamoxifen and its related metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, may induce growth arrest and/or apoptosis in HMECs that have acutely lost p53 function as a model of anti-estrogen chemoprevention. Surprisingly, we observed that tamoxifen but not 4-hydroxytamoxifen induced apoptosis in p53(−) HMECs. Tamoxifen-induced apoptosis was associated with a fall in mitochondrial potential, mitochondrial condensation, and caspase activation suggesting a critical role for mitochondrial targeting in mediating sensitivity to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. A 1.0 mm stock solution of tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma) was prepared in 100% ethanol and stored in opaque tubes at −70 °C. Control cultures received equivalent volumes of the ethanol solvent. Stocks were used under reduced light. Cell culture plasticware was from Corning Glass (Corning, NY). Normal human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) strain AG11132 (M. Stampfer, 172R/AA7) was purchased from the National Institute of Aging, Cell Culture Repository (Coriell Institute) (32Stampfer M. J. Tissue Cult. Method. 1985; 9: 107-121Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). HMEC strain AG11132 was established from normal tissue obtained at reduction mammoplasty, has a limited life span in culture, and fails to divide after ∼20–25 passages. AG11132 cells exhibit a low level of estrogen receptor staining, characteristic of normal mammary cells. AG11132 was at passage 8 at the time of receipt. Cells were grown in mammary epithelial cell basal medium (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) supplemented with 4 μl/ml bovine pituitary extract (Clonetics), 5 μg/ml insulin (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10−5m isoproterenol (Sigma), 10 mm HEPES buffer (Sigma) (Standard Medium). G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing medium was prepared by the addition of 300 μg/ml of G418 to Standard Medium. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2, 95% air. Mycoplasma testing was performed as reported previously (33Russell W.R. Newman C. Williamson D.H. Nature. 1975; 253: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 × 106 p53(+) HMEC-LXSN or p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells were plated in a T-75 flask on Day −5 in Standard Medium and grown for 4 days (Day −1). We previously observed that on Day −1 greater than 85% of the cells that had become growth factor-depleted are in G1/0phase, trypsinize without difficulty, and rapidly resume proliferation in the presence of fresh Standard Medium. 2E. C. Dietze, L. E. Caldwell, S. L. Grupin, M. Mancini, and V. L. Seewaldt, unpublished observations. Cells were synchronized by this method prior to each experiment. The LXSN16E6 retroviral vector containing the HPV-16 E6 coding sequence (provided by D. Galloway) has been described previously (24Demers G.W. Espling E. Harry J.B. Etscheid B.G. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6862-6869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AG11132 normal human mammary epithelial cells (passage 9) were plated in four T-75 tissue culture flasks in Standard Medium and grown to 50% confluency. Transducing virions from either the PA317-LXSN16E6 or the control PA317-LXSN (without insert) retroviral producer line were added at a multiplicity of infection at 1:1 in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) to log phase cells grown in T-75 flasks. The two remaining T-75 flasks were not infected with virus. After 48 h the 2 flasks containing transduced cells and 1 flask with untransduced cells were selected with Standard Medium containing 300 μg/ml G418. Cells were continued in G418 containing medium for 1 week, until 100% of control untransduced cells were dead. The 4th flask of unselected, untransduced parental control cells was passaged in parallel with the selected, transduced experimental and vector control cells. Parental AG11132 cells are designated HMEC-P, and transduced cells expressing the HPV-16E6 construct are designated p53(−) HMEC-E6, and vector control clones are designated p53(+) HMEC-LXSN. Preparation of cellular lysates and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (34Seewaldt V.L. Caldwell L.E. Johnson B.B. Swisshelm K. Collins S.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 631-641PubMed Google Scholar, 35Seewaldt V.L. Caldwell L.E. Johnson B.S. Swisshelm K. Collins S.J. Tsai S. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein lysates (∼100 μg of total protein) were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were run and then electroblotted (Hoeffer) at 80 mA for 45 min onto Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was blocked with 20% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS overnight at RT and then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-human p53 (Oncogene Science Ab-2). The membrane was washed three to five times at RT with 250 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Tween and then incubated with either a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a 1:35,000 dilution, or a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Sigma) for 1 h at RT. The blot was washed again, and complexes were detected by ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. p53(+) HMEC-P parental cells (passage 10), p53(+) HMEC-LXSN vector controls (passage 10), p53(−) HMEC-E6 (passage 10), and p53(−) HMEC-E6 (passage 20) cells were treated for 2, 12, and 24 h with 0.1 μm [3H]tamoxifen combined with 0.9 μm unlabeled tamoxifen. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, removed from the flask by scraping into 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, and pelleted. The pellet was extracted twice with 1 ml of methanol/ethyl acetate (1:3 v/v). The extracts were combined, dried under a stream of argon, and redissolved using the same solvent. Analysis of the extract was by HPLC using a C18 narrow bore column (Vydac). The gradient used was as follows: 1) 75% solvent A (aqueous 1% triethylamine (Aldrich)), 25% solvent B (acetonitrile (Burdick & Jackson) containing 1% triethylamine) that was held for 5 min after sample injection; 2) a linear gradient to 80% solvent B over 15 min; and 3) a continuation of 80% solvent B for 10 min. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min, and 20 μl of extract, containing ∼50,000 dpm, was injected. Samples were held in amber vials at 4 °C, handled under low light conditions, and monitored with an on-line scintillation detector (Packard Instrument Co.). Unlabeled tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were used as standards and monitored by UV absorption. p53(+) HMEC-LXSN vector controls and p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells were plated in duplicate at 1 × 104cells per 12-well tissue culture plates on Day −1 and allowed to adhere. On Day 0 the medium was replaced with Standard Medium with or without 1.0 μm tamoxifen or 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Untreated controls received an equivalent volume of ethanol solvent (0.1% final concentration). Cells were trypsinized at 24-h time intervals and counted in triplicate. Annexin V-FITC/a (Boehringer Ingelheim, Heidelberg, Germany) was used as per manufacturer's recommendation with some modification. Approximately 5 × 105 p53(+) HMEC-LXSN or p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells were plated in T-75 flasks on Day −1 and allowed to adhere. On Day 0 the medium was replaced with fresh Standard Medium, and tamoxifen or 4-hydroxytamoxifen was added for a final concentration of 1.0 μm. Untreated controls received an equivalent volume of ethanol solvent (0.1%). Cells were harvested after 24 h (Day 1) and did not exceed 25% confluency. For the tamoxifen-apoptosis time course cells were treated on Day 0 with 1.0 μm tamoxifen in Standard Medium and harvested 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h after treatment. Cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS, resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2; filtered through a 0.2-μm pore filter). Cell density was adjusted to 2–5 × 105 cells/ml. Five μl of recombinant human annexin V-FITC/a (BMS306F/a) was added to 195 μl of cell suspension, and the mixture was briefly mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were washed once and resuspended in 190 μl binding buffer. Cells were analyzed by FACScan as described below. 2.5–5.0 × 105 cells were plated per T-25 flask and were grown in Standard Medium. Tamoxifen or 4-hydroxytamoxifen stock was added directly to the media on Day 0 to bring the final concentration to 1.0 μm. Confluency did not exceed 70%. Cells were trypsinized 0, 6, 12, 18, or 24 h after treatment, washed in cold PBS, pelleted, and then resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) on ice for 15 min. The lysate was spun at 12,000 rpm for 30 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. The supernatant was removed and transferred to a second microcentrifuge tube. Both tubes were placed on ice, and 1.0 ml of 0.5 n perchloric acid was added to the nuclear pellet in the first tube and vortexed. Five hundred μl of 1n perchloric acid was added to the cytoplasmic fraction in the second tube and vortexed. Both tubes were spun at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were then discarded, and 1.0 ml of 0.5n perchloric acid was added to the pellets. The tubes were heated to 70 °C for 20 min to hydrolyze the DNA, then cooled to RT, and 1.0 ml of diphenylamine solution (1.5 g of diphenylamine (Aldrich) in 100 ml of glacial acetic acid, to which was added 1.5 ml of sulfuric acid and 0.1 ml of 1.6% acetaldehyde on the day of use) was added. The tubes were incubated 16–20 h at 30 °C. Absorbance was read at 600 nm (36Seewaldt V.L. Johnson B.S. Parker M.B. Collins S.J. Swisshelm K. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1077-1088PubMed Google Scholar). p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells and p53(+) HMEC-LXSN vector control cells were plated on Day −1 in 6-well tissue culture plates. On Day 0 cells were treated with 1.0 μm tamoxifen or 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Cells were then fixed in half-strength Karnovsky's fixative (37Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1965; 27: 137-142Google Scholar) for 6 h, rinsed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, and post-fixed in 1% collidine-buffered osmium tetroxide. Dehydration in graded ethanol and propylene oxide was followed by infiltration and embedding in Epon 812. Approximately 70–90-nm sections were stained using saturated aqueous uranyl acetate and lead tartrate. Photographs were taken using a JEOL 100 SX transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Approximately 200 cells were surveyed per data point following treatment for the presence or absence of apoptosis. Activated caspase-3 and -9 were detected utilizing the ApoAlertTM Caspase Fluorescent Assay Kit (CLONTECH). p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells and p53(+) HMEC-LXSN vector control cells were plated on Day −1 and treated with 1.0 μm tamoxifen or 4-hydroxytamoxifen in duplicate. Cells were trypsinized and counted, and 1 × 106 cells were pelleted and frozen at −80 °C. On the day of assay, the pellet was thawed, resuspended in 50 ml of chilled cell Lysis Buffer (CLONTECH), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 3 min at 4 °C to remove debris, and lysates were then transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. Fifty μl of 2× Reaction Buffer (CLONTECH), with 10 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol, and 5.0 μl of either 1.0 mm caspase-3 substrate (DEVD-AFC; 50 μm final concentration) or 5 mm caspase-9 substrate (LEHD-AMC; 250 μm final concentration) was added to each tube and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. To confirm the correlation between protease activity and product formation, either 1.0 μl of caspase-3 inhibitor (DEVD-CHO) or 2.0 μl of caspase-9 inhibitor (LEHD-CHO) was added to the reaction mixture of an induced sample and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before adding the caspase-3 or caspase-9 substrate, respectively. Samples were read in a Shimzdzu RF-1501 spectrofluorophotometer with at a 400 nm excitation filter and a 505 nm emission filter (caspase-3) or 380 nm excitation filter and a 460 nm emission filter. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was measured by rhodamine 123 (Molecular Probes) (38Johnson L.V. Walsh M.L. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar) and JC-1 red fluorescence (CLONTECH) (39Smiley S.T. Reers M. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Lin M. Chen A. Smith T.W. Steele G.D. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3671-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). JC-1 mitochondrial aggregate formation was measured by JC-1 green fluorescence (CLONTECH) (39Smiley S.T. Reers M. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Lin M. Chen A. Smith T.W. Steele G.D. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3671-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Relative mitochondrial mass was measured by flow cytometry using 1n-nonyl acridine orange (NAO; Molecular Probes) (40Boserma A.W.M. Nooter K. Oostrum R.G. Stoter G. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For rhodamine 123 staining, 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated at 37 °C in 0.5 mg/ml rhodamine 123. For JC-1 staining, 1 × 106 cells incubated with 10 μg/ml JC-1 for 10 min at 37 °C and were analyzed for red and green fluorescence. For NAO staining, 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1.0 ml of 1.0 μm NAO in PBS. Fluorescence of individual nuclei and whole cells was performed using a FACScan flow cytometer equipped with an argon-ion laser at 488 nm and 250 milliwatts light output and Lysis II software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). Forward and side scatter were used to establish size gates and exclude cellular debris. The excitation wavelength was 488 nm. The observation wavelengths were 530 nm for green fluorescence and 585 nm for red fluorescence. The red and green JC-1 fluorescence emissions from each cell were separated and measured using the standard optics of the FACScan. Ten thousand events were collected in list mode fashion, stored, and analyzed on Multicycle AV software (Phoenix Flow Systems). Retrovirally mediated expression of the HPV-16 E6 protein was utilized to suppress normal intracellular p53 protein levels in HMECs. Western blots were performed on p53(+) HMEC-LXSN vector controls (passages 10 and 18) and p53(−) HMEC-E6 transduced cells (passages 10 and 18) to determine the relative levels of p53 protein expression. Expression of p53 protein was observed in p53(+) HMEC-LXSN vector controls but was not detectable by Western analysis in early or late passage p53(−) HMEC-E6 transduced cells (Fig. 1). p53(+) HMEC-P parental cells (passage 8), p53(+) HMEC-LXSN controls (passage 10), early passage p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells (passage 10), and late passage p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells (passage 20) were treated with 1.0 μm radiolabeled tamoxifen and analyzed by HPLC at 24 h. There was no difference in tamoxifen metabolism in p53(+) or p53(−) HMECs (data not shown). No tamoxifen was metabolized to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and all radioactivity was recovered in the tamoxifen peak. p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells and p53(+) HMEC-LXSN vector controls were cultured in Standard Medium containing 1.0 μm tamoxifen or 4-hydroxytamoxifen. HPV-16 E6 inhibition of p53 expression was associated with a marked increase in sensitivity of early passage p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells (passage 10) to tamoxifen cytotoxicity relative to early passage p53(+) HMEC-LXSN vector controls (passage 10) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, early passage p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells and p53(+) HMEC-LXSN controls treated with 1.0 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen exhibited similar cytotoxicity (Fig. 2 A). Late passage p53(−) HMEC-E6 cells (passage 18) were resistant to both tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Fig. 2 B). Although p53(+) HMEC-LXSN vector controls (passage 16) demonstrated a decreased rate of proliferation as they neared in vitro senescence, they remained sensitive to tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen-mediated growth arrest (Fig. 2 B). These observations suggest that the acute loss p53 function by the targeted expression of HPV-16 E6 in HMECs is associated with enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen-mediated cytotoxicity but not that of 4-hydroxytamoxifen. p53(−) HMEC-E6 rapidly acquire resistance to both tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen cytotoxicity after serial passaging in vitro. We investigated the mechanism by which tamoxifen might potentiat"

Mouse PEA3 comprises 480 amino acids and bears an ∼85-amino acid ETS domain near its carboxyl terminus. Whereas analyses of bacterially expressed PEA3 revealed that the ETS domain is required for sequence-specific DNA binding, little is known of the functional domains in the protein required for its activity in mammalian cells. To this end, we defined the location of the PEA3 functional domains in COS cells. PEA3 bears a strong activation domain near its amino terminus, which is flanked by two regions that independently negatively regulate its activity. PEA3 expressed in COS cells was incapable of binding to DNA in vitro. However, DNA binding activity could be unmasked by incubation with a PEA3-specific antibody. Analyses of the DNA binding activity of PEA3 deletion mutants revealed that two regions flanking the ETS domain independently inhibited DNA binding; deletion of both regions was required to detect DNA binding in the absence of a PEA3-specific antibody. Under these conditions, the ETS domain was sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding. These findings suggest that the activity of PEA3 is exquisitely controlled at multiple functional levels.

These proteins are found exclusively in multicellular organisms and are thought to play cardinal roles in development and oncogenesis (2Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv.

Stehelin D. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Ets proteins are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that regulate transcription (reviewed in Ref. 2Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, these proteins activate transcription, but several members of the family are known to repress this process. DNA binding is achieved by interaction between the ETS domain and an ∼10-base pair sequence element termed the Ets binding site comprising a highly conserved central core sequence, 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′. Individual Ets proteins demonstrate specificity for sequences flanking this core, but it is not uncommon for different Ets proteins to bind to the same Ets binding site. Structural analyses of the ETS domain reveal a winged-helix-turn-helix structure akin to that of theEscherichia coli catabolite activator protein and the HNF3/forkhead and heat shock transcription factors (4Donaldson L.W.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1513-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). 76% of all human breast tumors contain elevated levels of PEA3 RNA; 93% of the c-ERB-B2/HER2-positive subclass of these tumors overexpress PEA3 (20Benz C.C. O'Hagan R.C. Richter B. Scott G.K. Chang C.H. Xiong X. Chew K. Ljung B.M. Edgerton S. Thor A. Hassell J.A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1513-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PEA3 is also overexpressed in mouse mammary tumors arising in transgenic mice engineered to express murine c-Erb-B2/Her2 in their mammary glands (19Trimble M.S. Xin J.H. Guy C.T. Muller W.J. Hassell J.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3037-3042PubMed Google Scholar). Chromosomal translocations involving the PEA3 subfamily genes have been implicated in a minority of Ewing's sarcomas in humans (12Jeon I.S. Davis J.N. Braun B.S. Sublett J.E. Roussel M.F. Denny C.T.

The same region of EWS is translocated and juxtaposed to sequences encoding the ETS domain of theFLI-1 ETS gene, which is the most common translocation in this disease (23Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). EWS-FLI-1 chimeric genes encode EWS-FLI-1 fusion proteins that bear the ETS domain. The transcriptional activity of these chimeric proteins significantly supersedes that of FLI-1, and, unlike FLI-1, they induce transformation of a mouse 3T3 fibroblast cell line (24Bailly R.A.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar). These findings imply that the transcriptional activity of these chimeras is associated with their transforming and oncogenic potential. Like other Ets proteins that have been studied, PEA3 binds to DNA with specificity and activates transcription of reporter plasmids bearing PEA3-responsive promoters (8Xin J.H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Analyses of glutathioneS-transferase-PEA3 chimeras expressed in and purified fromE. coli demonstrate that the ETS domain is required and sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding as assessed in vitro by EMSA (8Xin J.H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, the location of sequences required for transactivation and DNA binding in mammalian cells has not been investigated. To this end we constructed and measured the specific activity of a series of unidirectional amino and C-terminal deletion mutants of PEA3 and of GAL4-PEA3 chimeras in mammalian COS cells. Our analyses revealed that PEA3 bears a strong activation domain near its amino terminus that is flanked by two negative regulatory regions, which markedly repress its activity. PEA3 expressed in COS cells was incapable of binding to DNA. However, DNA binding activity could be uncovered by incubation with PEA3-specific antibodies or by deleting two regulatory regions that flank the ETS domain. Hence, both the transactivation and DNA binding functions of PEA3 are negatively controlled, implying that a mechanism(s) exists to exquisitely regulate its activity. COS-1 cell were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone). The cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The PEA3 expression vector (pRSV-PEA3) was constructed by cloning PEA3 cDNA sequences (8Xin J.H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) between the Hin dIII andXba I sites of pRc/RSV (Invitrogen). The amino-terminal deletion mutants were derived from pRSV-PEA3 by polymerase chain reaction amplification using suitable primers followed by molecular cloning of the product into Hin dIII–Xba I-cleaved pRc/RSV. The primers used to derive the amino-terminal deletion mutants all comprised a Hin dIII site and a translation initiation consensus sequence 5′-ACCATGG-3′ (28Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 29Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the invariant sequence of all of the primers is 5′-GGAAGCTTACCATGG-3′ (the Hin dIII recognition site and the translation initiation codon are underlined). All of the polymerase chain reaction primers used to generate the C-terminal deletion mutants contained an Xba I restriction site and a stop codon (5′-TAG-3′); the complementary sequence of this primer is 5′-TAGAGATCTCC-3′ (the stop codon and Xba I cleavage site are underlined). A naturally occurring PEA3 codon precedes the stop codon in the mRNA of each C-terminal deletion mutant. The variable sequence of each primer used corresponded to that which flanks the deletions described above. GAL4-PEA3 chimeras were constructed by cloning polymerase chain reaction-amplified PEA3 sequences from RSV-PEA3 in frame between theBam HI and Xba I sites of pSG424 (30Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Primers containing a stop codon were used to derive GAL4-PEA3 chimeras bearing C-terminal deletion mutants as described above. The PEA3-responsive unit of the reporter plasmid (PEA3 5J. Barrett, L. MacIntosh, A. Edwards, and J. A. Hassell, unpublished data.-luciferase) comprises five copies of an optimal, high affinity PEA3 binding site, 5′- TGGCCGGAACCG-3′ (the core sequence of the Ets binding site is underlined). 2S. Bowman and J. A. Hassell, manuscript in preparation. These sequences were cloned into theXho I site of pGL3-Ad MLP. This reporter was derived by cloning a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-AGATCTCGAGCTCGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGATCTGAATTCGAGAAGCTT-3′) bearing the adenovirus type 2 major late promoter TATA box and flanking sequences between the Bgl II and Hin dIII sites of the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). The GAL4 reporter plasmid (GAL45-luciferase) contained five copies of a GAL4 DNA binding sites cloned into the Sma I site of the pGL3-Ad MLP reporter (31Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The junctions and inserts of all recombinant plasmids were sequenced on both strands to ensure that mutations were not introduced during polymerase chain reaction and molecular cloning. The transcriptional activity of PEA3, GAL4-PEA3, or their derivatives was assessed indirectly by measuring luciferase activity in equivalent amounts of lysate protein isolated from COS cells transfected with the appropriate luciferase reporter plasmid and either a PEA3 or GAL4-PEA3 effector plasmid. This value was normalized to the amount of PEA3 or an active and readily detected GAL4-PEA3 chimera (GAL4-PEA3dlC85) expressed in each experiment as determined by immunoblot analysis to derive the specific transcriptional activity of each protein. Because many of the mutant versions of PEA3 and GAL4-PEA3 were expressed at lower levels than the corresponding wild type (WT) proteins, we measured the specific activity of WT PEA3 or of GAL4-PEA3dlC85 over a range of protein concentrations. This was accomplished by transfecting COS cells with varying amounts of the appropriate effector plasmid and assay of the amount of luciferase activity present in equal amounts of lysate protein. Normalization of this value to the amount of PEA3 or GAL4-PEA3dlC85 expressed in the same experiment revealed a linear increase in luciferase activity that was directly proportional to the amount of PEA3 or GAL4-PEA3dlC85 present in the lysates. The PEA3 and GAL4-PEA3 deletion mutants assayed in this study were expressed within the limits of these values. COS cells were seeded into six-well plates at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/well, and 24 h later they were transfected with a total of 2 μg of DNA using 6 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent as specified by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed as described below. PEA3 transcriptional activity was determined following transfection of 0.5 μg of the PEA3-responsive reporter plasmid (PEA35-luciferase) with one of several doses (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 μg) of the effector plasmid (pRc/RSV-PEA3) encoding WT PEA3. The total amount of effector DNA was maintained at 0.8 μg by adding empty effector DNA (pRc/RSV). The total DNA concentration of each transfection mixture was adjusted to 2 μg with sheared salmon sperm DNA. The activity of the PEA3 deletion mutants was determined after cotransfection of 0.5 μg of the reporter plasmid with a single dose (0.8 μg) of the effector plasmid. The specific activity of the various PEA3 deletion mutants was expressed relative to that of WT PEA3, which was set at 100%. The activity of GAL4-PEA3 chimeras was assessed similarly, except that 0.25 μg of the GAL4 reporter plasmid was cotransfected with up to 0.5 μg of effector DNA encoding the various GAL4-PEA3 chimeric proteins. The total concentration of pSG424 DNA was adjusted to 0.5 μg when the activity of select GAL4-PEA3 chimeras was assessed by titration. Because we could not detect the GAL4 DNA binding domain encoded by pSG424 using immunoblotting, and because GAL4-PEA3 (bearing full-length PEA3) was transcriptionally inactive, we expressed the specific activity of the various GAL4-PEA3 chimeras relative to that of GAL4-PEA3dlN85, an active and readily detected fusion protein. The magnitude of luciferase expression effected by the chimeras was calculated by measuring the ratio of luciferase activity obtained from cells transfected with the reporter to that obtained from cells transfected with the reporter and effector plasmid encoding a particular GAL4-PEA3 chimera following normalization of the abundance of the chimera in equal amounts of lysate protein as described below. Within an experiment, each DNA preparation was transfected in quadruplicate; two wells of a six-well dish were independently processed to measure luciferase activity, and two wells were independently used to determine the abundance of PEA3 or its derivatives by immunoblot analysis. Cell extracts for luciferase assays were prepared from each well using 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega catalog no. E3971) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured using luciferase assay reagent (Promega catalog no. E1483). Luciferase activity was expressed in relative light units per μg of total protein after subtracting the activity of the empty effector plasmid control. To determine the abundance of PEA3 or its derivatives, the cell monolayers were washed in the wells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped from the plates in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were concentrated by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then incubated on ice for 25 min. The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was used for immunoblot analysis. The total protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bradford dye method using a kit provided by Bio-Rad with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as the standard. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg of total protein from cell extracts or 8 μg of protein from nuclear extracts) from the duplicate samples were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. The membrane was washed in distilled water and then blocked for 20 min at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk. PEA3 and its deleted derivatives were detected on the membrane by use of one of several antibodies including one monoclonal antibody and two different polyclonal antibodies. The PEA3-specific monoclonal antibody is named MP16 and recognizes determinants between residues 226 and 245. 3L. Hastings and J. A. Hassell, unpublished results. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies are termed PN1 and PC2 and recognize epitopes at the extreme amino and carboxyl terminus of PEA3, respectively. 4S. Arber and T. Jessell, personal communication. PN1 was derived by injecting rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide corresponding to the first 15 amino acids of mouse PEA3, whereas PC2 was raised by injecting rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide bearing the C-terminal 15 amino acids of mouse PEA3. A commercial rabbit polyclonal antibody reactive with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 was used to quantify the abundance of GAL4-PEA3 on immunoblots (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY; catalog no. 06-262). 125I-Labeled goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG were used as secondary antibodies. Quantification of expression levels of PEA3 and GAL4-PEA3 chimeras was performed by use of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) equipped with ImageQuant 3.3 software. In one series of experiments described here, the abundance of several GAL4-PEA3 chimeras (GAL4-PEA3dlC100, GAL4-PEA3dlN42dlC100, GAL4-PEA3dlC85 and GAL4-PEA3dlN42dlC85) was also measured using a rabbit polyclonal primary antibody reactive with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (BAbCo; PRB-255C) and a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to peroxidase (KPL; 474-1506) using chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantification of the amount of the chimeric proteins using these reagents was accomplished with a Kodak ImageStation and Kodak 1D image analysis software version 3.0. Unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends, the specific transcriptional activity of the various PEA3 and GAL4-PEA3 proteins was determined in duplicate within an experiment, and each experiment was repeated at least twice using two different preparations of the various reporter and effector DNAs. Transfections were carried out as described above except that the COS-1 cells were initially plated in 60-mm (diameter) dishes at a density of ∼3 × 105 cells/dish. The cells were transfected with a total of 6 μg of DNA comprising 3 μg of expression plasmid DNA and 3 μg of salmon sperm DNA as carrier. The amount of the WT PEA3 expression vector used was varied (1, 2, or 3 μg) in each experiment to derive a normal curve, whereas the total amount of the expression vector encoding the PEA3 deletion mutants was set at 3 μg in each experiment. Nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection as described (32Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). EMSAs were carried out as described previously (8Xin J.H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The binding buffer used contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.4 mm spermidine, and 7% glycerol. 5 μg of nuclear extract was used for each binding reaction. A PEA3-specific antibody was added to these reactions where stated. A radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-AATTCGCGAGTGGCCGGAACCGGACG-3 and the complementary sequence 5′-GATCCGTCCGGTTCCGGCCACTCGCG-3′) bearing an optimal PEA3 binding site was used as a probe in these assays.2 Prior to their use, the DNA strands were annealed and labeled by fill-in reaction with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I using [α-32P]dATP. The double-stranded oligonucleotide was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 0.3 ng of this DNA was used in the binding assays. DNA binding activity was quantified by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) as described above. The specific DNA binding activity of the various PEA3-related proteins was determined by normalizing DNA binding activity to the expression level of each PEA3 deletion mutant. The specific DNA binding activity of WT PEA3 was set as 100%. Unless stated otherwise in the figure legends, all DNA binding experiments were carried out a minimum of three times with at least two independent preparations of the effector DNAs encoding PEA3 or its deleted derivatives. Original autoradiographs were scanned in Adobe Photoshop 3.0, and the final figures were produced using Canvas 5. In several of the figures, lanes on the same autoradiogram were juxtaposed to facilitate representation of the data. When lanes from the same autoradiogram were spaced together, this was achieved in such a way as to reveal a thin white line between adjacent lanes. Otherwise, the final figures are faithful representations of the original autoradiograms. To define the functional domains in PEA3, we constructed a set of unidirectional amino and C-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. 1 A). These were expressed in COS cells from the pRc/RSV effector plasmid and their capacity to stimulate luciferase expression from a PEA3-responsive reporter plasmid was measured. The synthetic promoter of the reporter plasmid comprises five repeats of an optimal PEA3 binding site juxtaposed to a minimal TATA box. Commonly, WT PEA3 expressed from the effector plasmid increased expression of luciferase from the reporter plasmid to levels 10–20-fold higher than that achieved following transfection of the reporter plasmid alone (data not shown). The mutant proteins were rarely expressed at the same level as the WT protein. Indeed, many of the mutants that we isolated did not encode stable proteins and were not analyzed further. In consequence, it was necessary to measure the transcriptional activity (represented by luciferase activity) and the abundance of each mutant protein in the same experiment to derive their specific activity. The specific activity of each of the mutant proteins was calculated and normalized to that of WT PEA3, which was set at 100%. A schematic of the structure of the various amino and C-terminal deletion mutants of PEA3 that were analyzed is illustrated in Fig.1 A. We report the average relative expression level and the specific activity of each of the PEA3 mutants by comparison with that of WT from several experiments in Fig. 1 B. A representative immunoblot from a single experiment is shown in Fig. 1, C and D, respectively. Analyses of two amino-terminal truncation mutants revealed that deletion of 29 or 45 amino acids from this terminus reproducibly increased the specific transcriptional activity of the resulting proteins 2–3-fold, implying that these sequences negatively regulate PEA3 activity (Fig. 1 B). Mutants with amino-terminal end points at residues 55, 65, 74, and 85 were progressively compromised in their capacity to stimulate luciferase expression by comparison with WT. Indeed, the specific activity of dlN85 was only 10% that of the WT protein. These observations are consistent with the presence of positively acting sequences, perhaps an activation domain, in this amino-terminal region. Surprisingly, a mutant lacking the first 106 amino acids of PEA3 was 5-fold more active than dlN85 and only 2-fold less active than WT PEA3. Hence, residues between amino acids 85 and 106 may comprise another negative regulatory region. The specific activity of several other progressively larger amino-terminal deletion mutants (dlN120, dlN130, and dlN145) was similar to that of dl106, implying that residues between 106 and 145 play little role in the activity of PEA3. However, amino-terminal deletions extending to residues 226, 245, and 326 were increasingly reduced in their activity, consistent with the occurrence of another activation domain in this region. The ETS domain in PEA3 is located between residues 334 and 417; deletions impinging on the ETS domain abolished transcriptional activity probably by compromising DNA binding and consequently were not characterized further (Ref. 41Graves B.J. Cowley D.O. Goetz T.L. Petersen J.M. Jonsen M.D. Gillespie M.E. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar; data not shown). Four C-terminal deletion mutants were isolated and characterized (dlC450, dlC440, dlC430, and dlC420). Each of these was reproducibly more active (∼2-fold) than the WT protein, implying that sequences between residues 480 (the C-terminal residue of PEA3) and 450 negatively regulate PEA3 activity. Taken together, the results of the analyses of both the amino- and C-terminal deletion mutants suggested the occurrence of both positively and negatively acting regions located outside of the borders of the PEA3 ETS DNA binding domain. The various deletion mutants described previously may have lesions affecting either the transactivation or the DNA binding function of PEA3. Deletions that increased or decreased PEA"

In the present study, the biologic activities of FFSi and aged silica (ASi) were compared by measuring their effects on the AP-1 activation and phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinase. The roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this silica-induced AP-1 activation were also investigated. We found that FFSi-induced AP-1 activation was four times higher than that of ASi in JB6 cells. FFSi also caused greater phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinase than ASi. FFSi generated more ROS than ASi when incubated with the cells as measured by electron spin resonance (ESR). Studies using ROS-sensitive dyes and oxygen consumption support the conclusion that ROS are generated by silica-treated cells. N-Acetylcysteine (an antioxidant) and polyvinyl pyridine-N-oxide (an agent that binds to Si-OH groups on silica surfaces) decreased AP-1 activation and phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinase. Catalase inhibited phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinase, as well as AP-1 activation induced by FFSi, suggesting the involvement of H2O2 in the mechanism of silica-induced AP-1 activation. Sodium formate (an ⋅OH scavenger) had no influence on silica-induced MAPKs or AP-1 activation. Superoxide dismutase enhanced both AP-1 and MAPKs activation, indicating that H2O2, but not O⨪2, may play a critical role in silica-induced AP-1 activation. These studies indicate that freshly ground silica is more biologically active than aged silica and that ROS, in particular H2O2, play a significant role in silica-induced AP-1 activation.

The pulmonary response to silica, however, was found to vary considerably in different species, with mice developing silicosis but no lung cancer and hamsters just showing storage of silica in lung macrophages with no apparent pathology (4International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC Monogr.

Earlier studies have also demonstrated that FFSi1 is capable of generating hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) upon reaction with aqueous media (12Shi X. Dalal N.S. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1988; 25: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Vallyathan V. Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Irr W. Castranova V. Am. Rev. Respir.

Superoxide anion radicals (O⨪2) may also be generated (15Dalal N.S. Shi X. Vallyathan V. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 9: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The silicon-based free radicals (Si⋅, SiO⋅ , and SiOO⋅) and the associated generation of H2O2 and ⋅OH appear to be involved in the lipid peroxidation and membrane damage (12Shi X. Dalal N.S. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1988; 25: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Vallyathan V. Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Irr W. Castranova V. Am. Rev. Respir.

These radicals are also associated with silica-induced DNA damage, for example both strand breakage and hydroxylation of dG residues have been observed (10Shi X. Mao Y. Daniel L.N. Saffiotti U. Dalal N.S. Vallyathan V. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102 Suppl. 10: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shi X. Castranova V. Halliwell B. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B. Crit. Rev. 1998; 1: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). O⨪2, H2O2, and ⋅OH are generally called reactive oxygen species (ROS). For direct ROS generation via a reaction between silica and aqueous medium in the absence of cells, a relatively large amount of silica particles is needed to generate detectable amounts of ROS. However, silica also can generate ROS via stimulation of cells. In this mechanism of ROS generation, silica induces ROS production as part of the respiratory burst reaction to particles. ROS generated by this mechanism may be responsible for silica-induced activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB (16Chen F. Lu Y. Demers L.M. Rojanasakul Y. Shi X. Vallyathan V. Castranova V. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1998; 28: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which ROS from cells stimulated by silica activates AP-1 remains to be investigated fully. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that FFSi causes AP-1 activation both in vitro using cell culture systems andin vivo using transgenic mice (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). AP-1 is a transcription factor that consists of either a Jun-Jun homodimer or a Jun-Fos heterodimer (19Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Genes regulated by AP-1 have been reported to play an important role in neoplastic transformation, tumor progression, and metastasis (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys.

Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Blocking 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate-induced AP-1 activation has been shown to inhibit neoplastic transformation (23Huang C. Ma W. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Inhibition of AP-1 activity in transformed JB6 RT101 cells causes reversion from the tumor phenotype (24Dong Z. Lavrovsky V. Colburn N.H. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study, using transgenic mice, has demonstrated that AP-1 transactivation is required for tumor promotion (25Young M.R. Li J.J. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Sathyanarayana B.K. Hunziker R. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In light of the important role of AP-1 activation in neoplastic transformation and tumor promotion, we hypothesized that the silica-induced AP-1 activation may play a critical role in silica-induced carcinogenesis. Earlier studies have suggested that FFSi exhibits increased surface reactivity compared with ASi (12Shi X. Dalal N.S. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1988; 25: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Vallyathan V. Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Irr W. Castranova V. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1988; 138: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Because the pulmonary response to silica differs in the chronic and acute presentation of disease, we proposed that at least part of the acute response is due to some unique characteristics of the dust inhaled. Acute silicosis is commonly associated with sandblasting, rock drilling, tunneling, and silica mill operations, i.e. operations in which silica particles are crushed or sheared (2Craighead J.S. Kleinerman J. Abraham J.L. Gibbs A.R. Green F.H.Y. Harley R.A. Ruettner J.R. Vallyathan N.V. Juliano E.B. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1988; 112: 673-720PubMed Google Scholar, 13Vallyathan V. Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Irr W. Castranova V. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1988; 138: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Based on the early reports that FFSi was more surface-reactive than ASi, we proposed that these surface features might be responsible for the enhanced carcinogenic effects of silica in the lung (17Shi X. Castranova V. Halliwell B. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B. Crit. Rev. 1998; 1: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study, the cytotoxic and biologic activities of FFSiversus ASi were investigated by comparing their effects on the phosphorylation of MAPKs and AP-1 activation. In situgeneration of ROS by cells stimulated with silica was studied using fluorescence staining and ESR. Finally, the role of ROS in silica-induced AP-1 activation was evaluated. SOD, N-acetyl-cysteine, DMPO, sodium formate, and PVPNO were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Catalase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). The spin trap, DMPO, was purified by charcoal decolorization and vacuum distillation. DMPO solution, thus purified, did not contain any ESR-detectable impurities. Chelex 100 chelating resin was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Richmond, CA). The phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was treated with Chelex 100 to remove transition metal ion contaminants. Eagle's MEM was obtained from Whittaker Biosciences (Walkersville, MD). FBS, gentamicin, andl-glutamine were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Luciferase assay substrate was obtained fromPromega (Madison, WI). PhosphoPlus MAPK antibody kits were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverley, MA). H2DCFDA and dihydroethidium were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Crystalline silica was obtained from the Generic Center, Pennsylvania State University (State College, PA). The detailed method for preparation of the FFSi has been described elsewhere (14Dalal N.S. Shi X. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1990; 29: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, crystalline silica (0.2–10 mm in diameter) was ground for 30 min using a ball grinder equipped with agate mortar and balls. The ground silica was sieved through a 10-μm mesh filter for 20 min before use. Purity was checked using x-ray diffraction spectrometry, and diameter was determined by morphometric analyses, which indicated that fractured silica had a purity of 99.5% and a mean diameter of 3.7 μm. The mouse JB6/AP/κB cell line, which was stably transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), was cultured in Eagle's MEM containing 5% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μg of gentamicin/ml. A confluent monolayer of JB6/AP/κB cells was trypsinized, and 5 × 104 viable cells (suspended in 1 ml of Eagle's MEM supplemented with 5% FBS) were added to each well of a 24-well plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Twelve hours later, cells were cultured in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 12–24 h to minimize basal AP-1 activity and then exposed to silica in the same medium to monitor the effects on AP-1 induction. The cells were extracted with 200 μl of 1× lysis buffer provided in the luciferase assay kit by the manufacturer. Luciferase activity was measured using a Monolight luminometer, model 3010 (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The results were expressed as relative AP-1 activity compared with untreated controls. Immunoblots for phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinase were carried out as described in the protocol of New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), using phospho-specific antibodies against phosphorylated sites of ERKs and p38 kinase. Nonphospho-specific antibodies against ERKs and p38 kinase proteins provided in each assay kit were used to normalize the phosphorylation assay by using the same transferred membrane blot. All ESR measurements were conducted using a Varian E9 ESR spectrometer and a flat cell assembly. Hyperfine couplings were measured (to 0.1 G) directly from magnetic field separation using K3CrO8 and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl as reference standards. An EPRDAP 2.0 program was used for data acquisition and analysis. Reactants were mixed in test tubes in a final volume of 450 μl. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a flat cell for ESR measurement. The concentrations given in the figure legends are final concentrations. All experiments were performed at room temperature and under ambient air except those specifically indicated. JB6 cells (1 × 106) suspended in 1 ml PBS were incubated with or without silica for 30 min. H2O2 generation was monitored by measuring the change in fluorescence of scopoletin (0.72 mm) in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (6.6 units/ml). Fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm using a Cytofluor multiwell plate reader series 4000 (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). Dihydroethidium and H2DCFDA are specific dyes used for staining O⨪2 and H2O2 produced by intact cells (26Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Zanin C. Vayssiere J.L. Petit P.X. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 27Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). JB6 cells (2 × 104/well) were seeded onto a glass coverslip in the bottom of a well of a 24-well plate for 24 h. The cells were treated with FFSi or ASi in the presence of dihydroethidium (2 μm) or H2DCFDA (5 μm) for 30 min. The cells were then washed in PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin. The glass coverslip was mounted on a microscope slide and observed under a Sarastro 2000 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) laser scanning confocal microscope fitted with an argon-ion laser. Oxygen consumption measurements were carried out using a Gilson Oxygraph (Model 516, Gilson Medical Electronics, Middleton WI). Cell concentration was 6.25 × 105/ml, and measurements were made over a period of 10 min. Data presented are the means ± S.E. of values compared and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed Student's t test for paired data, and considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Earlier studies have suggested that FFSi was more surface-reactive than aged silica (12Shi X. Dalal N.S. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1988; 25: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Vallyathan V. Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Irr W. Castranova V. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1988; 138: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To explore the differential effects of FFSi and ASi on the induction of AP-1 activity, 5 × 104 JB6 cells were exposed for 24 h to various doses (10–300 μg/ml) of freshly fractured or fractured silica aged for 12 months. The AP-1 activation induced by FFSi was significantly higher than that of ASi in JB6 cells (Fig. 1). FFSi induced significant AP-1 activation at a concentration of 80 μg/ml silica, reaching a maximum activation at 200 μg/ml. The maximum AP-1 induction by FFSi increased 8-fold compared with controls, whereas the maximum AP-1 induction by the silica aged for 12 months increased less than 3-fold compared with controls. These results indicate that FFSi exhibited a greater effect on AP-1 induction than ASi. To further explore the decay of AP-1 induction by silica with time after fracturing (aging), the induction of AP-1 activation by FFSi or fractured silica aged for 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months was monitored in the same experiment. JB6 cells (5 × 104) were exposed to 200 μg/ml silica for 24 h, and the luciferase activity was measured as described under “Material and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 2, the AP-1 induction by silica was decreased with aging. Silica-induced AP-1 activation decreased by 35%, 65%, or 75% after 8 weeks, 6 months, or 12 months of storage, respectively. The half time for the decrease in the ability of fractured silica to activate AP-1 was proximately 3 months. Fractured silica still produced a 2.5-fold increase in AP-1 induction after 12 months of storage. Previous studies in our laboratory have indicated that silica-induced AP-1 activation is mediated through phosphorylation of MAPKs family members, ERKs and p38 kinases (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of FFSi versus ASi on activation of MAPKs, phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinases was examined. JB6 cells cultured in MEM medium in 6-well plates were exposed for 30 min to 150 μg/ml freshly fractured silica or fractured silica aged for different time periods as indicated. Then the cells were lysed by sample buffer and the phosphorylation of ERKs or p38 kinase was analyzed as described in the protocol of New England BioLabs. Phosphorylation of ERKs or p38 kinase was greater after exposure of the cells to FFSi than ASi (Fig.3). These results were correlated with the AP-1 activation induced by FFSi or ASi. Because FFSi was more potent than ASi, we hypothesized that ROS may be involved in silica-induced AP-1 stimulation. To examine this hypothesis, the effects of antioxidants and other reagents on silica-induced AP-1 activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs were investigated. JB6 cells (5 × 104) cultured in 24-well plates were pretreated for 1 h with antioxidants and other reagents. Then the cells were exposed to 150 μg/ml FFSi in the presence of the same reagents for 24 h and the luciferase activity of the cell lysate was tested. The effects of antioxidants and other reagents on silica-induced AP-1 activation are shown in Fig. 4. Catalase, a H2O2-scavenging enzyme, strongly inhibited silica-induced AP-1 activation by 90%. Sodium formate, an ⋅OH radical scavenger, had no effect on the induction. SOD, a O⨪2radical scavenger that generates H2O2, increased the AP-1 activation by 70%. Deferoxamine, a metal ion chelator, had a slight inhibitory effect. N-Acetylcysteine, a thio-containing antioxidant, or PVPNO, which binds to silanol groups on the silica surface, significantly inhibited the AP-1 induction. Similar results were obtained for the effects of these reagents on silica-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase and ERKs. Catalase, a H2O2 scavenger, inhibited both p38 kinase and ERKs phosphorylation induced by silica, whereas SOD, which generates H2O2, enhanced the phosphorylation (Fig.5, A and B). In contrast, formate, a ⋅OH scavenger, was ineffective. These results suggest that H2O2 might be the mediator for stimulation of p38 and ERKs signal transduction pathways leading to AP-1 induction.Figure 5Effect of antioxidant reagents on silica-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase and ERKs. JB6 P+ cells were cultured in 5% FBS MEM medium in 6-well plates until 80% confluent and then cultured in 0.1% FBS MEM medium for 24 h. The cells were then exposed to 150 μg/ml FFSi in the presence of various antioxidants or other reagents as indicated. The concentrations of the reagents used were: catalase, 10,000 units/ml; sodium formate, 2 mm; SOD, 500 units/ml; PVPNO, 50 μg/ml. The cells were lysed and phosphorylated, and nonphosphorylated p38 kinase protein (A) and ERKs proteins (B) were assayed using a PhosphoPlus MAPKs kit from New England BioLabs. The phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated proteins were analyzed by using the same transferred membrane blot following a stripping procedure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that ROS are involved in silica-induced AP-1 activation, ESR spin trapping was used to detect ROS generation during cellular reactions in the presence of silica (28Rosen G.M. Finkelstin E. Adv. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 345-375Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 29Britigan B.E. Rosen G.M. Thompson B.Y. Chai Y. Cohen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17026-17032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly fractured silica or JB6 cells alone did not generate any detectable radical signal (Fig.6, a and b). Whereas freshly ground silica plus JB6 cells generated a spin adduct signal (Fig. 6 c) consisting of a 1:2:2:1 quartet with hyperfine splitting of aN =aH = 14.8 G, where aN andaH denote hyperfine splitting of the nitroxyl nitrogen and α-hydrogen, respectively. Based on this splitting and the 1:2:2:1 line shape, the spectrum was assigned to the DMPO-OH adduct, which is an example of ⋅OH radical generation. Catalase significantly decreased this signal, indicating the importance of H2O2 (Fig. 6 d). Addition of SOD failed to inhibit the signal (Fig. 6 e). Addition of H2O2 increased the signal intensity (Fig.6 f). Because DMPO-OH signal may be generated by a mechanism other than ⋅OH trapping (30Keisuke M. Akifumi H. Hiroshi I. Akira M. Masatoshi N. Can. J. Chem. 1992; 70: 2818-2827Crossref Google Scholar), spin trapping competition experiments were performed for verification of ⋅OH generation. In these experiments the ⋅OH radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from formate, resulting in a decrease of DMPO-OH spin adduct signal intensity. As shown in Fig. 6 g, addition of formate indeed reduced the signal intensity, showing that ⋅OH radicals were generated and trapped in the reaction system. Addition of deferoxamine, which chelates the metal ions such as Fe(II) to make them less reactive toward H2O2, also decreased the signal intensity (Fig. 6 h), indicating that a metal-mediated Fenton or Fenton-like reaction plays a key role in ⋅OH generation from the silica-stimulated cells. Addition ofN-acetyl-l-cysteine, a general antioxidant, decreased the adduct signal (Fig. 6 i). Incubation of silica aged for 1 year with the cells produced only a very week signal (Fig.6 j). The above results suggest that H2O2 might play a key role on silica-induced AP-1 and MAPK activation (Figs. 4 and5). Next, we measured the H2O2 generation by JB6 cells upon stimulation with silica. JB6 cells were incubated with FSi (1 mg/ml) for 30 min, and the generation of H2O2 was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig.7, the generation of H2O2 by JB6 cells treated with FSi was markedly increased compared with untreated control cells. Catalase substantially inhibited silica-induced H2O2 generation by JB6 cells. In contrast, SOD had no significant effect. These results are parallel and comparable with the studies on the effect of catalase and SOD on silica-induced AP-1 and MAPK activation (Figs. 4 and 5). The data also provide more evidence for the important role of H2O2 on silica-induced AP-1 activation. To further confirm the ROS generation by JB6 cells stimulated with silica, cells treated with silica were analyzed by intracellular staining for H2O2 and O⨪2. H2DCFDA, a specific fluorescent dye for H2O2, and dihydroethidium, a specific fluorescent dye for O⨪2, were applied to cells to monitor ROS generation. In the presence of FFSi, the fluorescent signals of both H2O2 and O⨪2 were dramatically increased within 30 min after treatment of the cells (Fig. 8). In the presence of silica aged for 1 year, the signals were substantially less intense than those for the cells treated with FFSi (Fig. 8). Fluorescence was displayed using a pseudo-color intensity scale where low intensity sites appear blue, and increasingly high intensity areas are displayed as green, yellow, red, orwhite. The above results indicate that O⨪2 and H2O2 are generated during the interaction of JB6 cells with silica. If this is the case, exposure of the cells to silica should result in an increased rate of oxygen consumption. To test this hypothesis the rate of oxygen consumption by JB6 cells (6.25 × 105) in the presence or absence of fresh or aged silica was monitored using a Gilson Oxygraph. The results are presented in Fig. 9. Cells alone consumed molecular oxygen at a steady basal rate, whereas in the presence of FFSi oxygen consumption increased by 33%. Dismutation of O⨪2by SOD resulted in about half the amount of O2 consumption (data not shown). In contrast, when cells were incubated with 1-year-old ASi, the oxygen consumption was no significantly different from the basal level. In the presence of PVPNO, the oxygen consumption by the cells treated with FFSi was significantly decreased. Crystalline silica is a recently designated carcinogen and is strongly associated with silicosis, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the silica-induced pathogenesis are not fully understood (3McDonald J.C. Castranova V. Silica and Silica-Induced Lung Diseases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 383-406Google Scholar, 17Shi X. Castranova V. Halliwell B. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health B. Crit. Rev. 1998; 1: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that silica-mediated free radical reactions may cause a persistent oxidative stress in the lung and play a key role in the mechanism of silica-induced carcinogenesis. Most of the studies concerning the role of ROS in silica-induced cytotoxicity have been limited to lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and other critical changes in noncellular systems (10Shi X. Mao Y. Daniel L.N. Saffiotti U. Dalal N.S. Vallyathan V. Environ. Health Perspect. 1994; 102 Suppl. 10: 149-154PubMed Google Scholar, 11Daniel L.N. Mao Y. Williams A.O. Saffiotti U. Scand. J. Work. Environ.

Health. 1990; 29: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, our previous study has shown that silica induces AP-1 activation in cell and animal models through ERKs and p38 kinase pathways (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that ROS is the mediator for silica-induced AP-1 activation. By comparing of AP-1 activation induced by FFSi versus ASi, we found that AP-1 activation induced by FFSi was 4-fold higher than that of silica fractured and aged for 1 year. The enhanced potency of FFSi was also exhibited for silica-induced phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinase. We also demonstrate that H2O2, formed during the interaction of silica with the cells, might be a reactive intermediate responsible for silica-induced AP-1 activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs. The results from the present study show that silica-induced AP-1 activation involves ROS-mediated reactions. A major role of H2O2 in silica-induced AP-1 activation is supported by the following observations: (a) catalase, whose function is to remove H2O2, blocked the AP-1 activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs; (b) SOD, which converts O⨪2 to H2O2, enhanced AP-1 activation; (c) sodium formate, a scavenger of ⋅OH radical, did not exhibit any effect; and (d) treatment of cells with freshly fractured silica resulted in a 9.5-fold increase in H2O2 production. As for ROS generation, it may be noted that our earlier studies (12Shi X. Dalal N.S. Vallyathan V. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1988; 25: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Vallyathan V. Shi X.L. Dalal N.S. Irr W. Castranova V. Am. Rev. Respir.

Commun. 1990; 9: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have shown that FFSi generates silicon-based radicals (Si⋅, SiO⋅ ,and SiOO⋅). These silicon radicals can generate ROS upon reaction with aqueous medium. The present study shows that silica is also able to generate ROS via stimulation of cells and that this ROS production occurs at a lower concentration of silica than in noncellular systems. During these processes, molecular oxygen was consumed to generate O⨪2 radical, which produced H2O2 by dismutation. H2O2 generated the ⋅OH radical via a Fenton or Fenton-like reaction. The following experimental observations support the above pathway of ROS generation from silica-stimulated cells: (a) Oxygen consumption assay showed that silica-stimulated cells consumed molecular oxygen; (b) both O⨪2 and H2O2 were generated as measured by fluorescence staining of silica-exposed cells; (c) ESR spin trapping studies showed that ⋅OH radicals were generated; (d) catalase inhibited the signal, whereas H2O2 enhanced it; (e) addition of SOD, whose function is to remove O⨪2, did not substantially alter ⋅OH generation; and (f) addition of deferoxamine, which chelates metal ions such as Fe(II) to make them less reactive toward H2O2, reduced ⋅OH generation. The signal transduction pathways leading to AP-1 activation and the possible involvement of ROS were also investigated in the present study. It is well known that stress-related signals, such as UV radiation or ROS, induce the activation of MAPK pathways. ERKs, JNKs, and p38 are important signal transduction pathways involved in AP-1 activation, and AP-1 is one of the downstream targets of these three MAPK members. An earlier study has shown that FFSi caused phosphorylation of ERKs and p38, but not JNKs (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The results obtained from the present study show that FFSi caused phosphorylation of both p38 and MAPKs to a greater degree than that induced by ASi. Moreover, catalase inhibited the silica-induced phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 kinase, suggesting that H2O2 is required in the phosphorylation process. These results further suggest that H2O2 plays a key role in AP-1 activation. It should be noted that PVPNO significantly inhibited silica-induced AP-1 activation and phosphorylation of MAPKs. SiOH groups on the silica surface have been proposed to be involved in silica-induced cellular damage. Chemical modification of the silica surface can be used to reduce toxicity in vitro and fibrosis in vivo(31Vallyathan V. Mega J.F. Shi X. Dalal N.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 404-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is known that when silica particles are exposed to water, surface silicon-oxygen bonds (Si–O) are hydrated, resulting in the formation of SiOH groups. PVPNO is able to bind to SiOH groups. It has been reported that PVPNO inhibits silica-induced toxicity and decreases or delays the development of silicosis in experimental animals and humans. It also blocks the interaction of the silica surface with phosphate groups of DNA in vitro. It has been reported that PVPNO inhibits silica-induced ROS generation in cells (31Vallyathan V. Mega J.F. Shi X. Dalal N.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 404-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 32Castranova V. Castranova V. Silica and Silica-Induced Lung Diseases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1996: 293-298Google Scholar). The present study used mouse epidermal cells as an in vitromodel system. These epidermal cells were employed, because they exhibit a stronger although qualitatively similar response compared with bronchial epithelial cells (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in our previous studies, we have shown that in vivo responses in transgenic mice were qualitatively similar to studies in epidermal cells (18Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our studies show that FFSi particles are much more potent in inducing AP-1 activation than are ASi. Upon stimulation by silica, JB6 cells are able to generate a whole spectrum of ROS. Compared with a direct reaction between silica with aqueous medium, the yield of ROS generation from silica-stimulated cells is much higher. Among the ROS produced, H2O2 appears to be the species responsible for silica-induced AP-1 activation. Our novel findings suggest that ROS may play a key role in silica-induced oncogene stimulation. Because oncogene stimulation is thought to be involved in carcinogenesis, there is a need to study further the mechanisms involved in this process."

These proteins contain a heme that acts as a sensing site of NO (sGC), O2(FixL, DOS, and HemAT), and CO (CooA). CooA from Rhodospirillum rubrum is a heme-based CO-sensing transcriptional activator. Although the function of the heme in CooA is as a sensor of a gaseous effector molecule, similar to other heme-based sensor proteins, the coordination structure of the heme in CooA is quite different from that in FixL and sGC. In the case of FixL and sGC, the heme is five-coordinate with a histidine as a proximal ligand in the resting state and binds the effector, O2 or NO, at the distal side trans to the proximal histidine (4–23). On the other hand, the heme in CooA is six-coordinate in the ferric, ferrous, and CO-bound forms (26Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The release of the axial ligand from the heme upon binding CO causes conformational changes around the heme and subsequently in the whole molecule (28Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K.

These conformational changes induced by the interchange of the axial ligand are the principal part of the activation of CooA by CO. Because the heme in CooA plays a central role in sensing CO and in regulating the transcriptional activator activity of CooA, elucidation of the coordination structure of the heme in CooA is required to understand the mechanisms of CO sensing and of the activation of CooA by CO. Mutagenesis studies, EPR, resonance Raman, and uv/vis spectroscopies have revealed that the heme is in the six-coordinate and low-spin state in ferric, ferrous, and CO-bound CooA, and that Cys75 and His77 are the fifth ligand of the ferric and ferrous hemes in CooA, respectively (28Uchida T.

Although the crystal structure of ferrous CooA has been reported, the sixth ligand of the ferric heme in CooA remains to be elucidated.

We report herein the coordination structure of the heme in CooA revealed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and EXAFS analyses. In this study, we also examined the redox properties of the heme in CooA by means of electrochemical redox titrations. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using the Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The expression and purification of the recombinant CooA were carried out as reported previously (26Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 100 mm NaCl was used for the final step of the purification. The purified CooA was concentrated to about 30 μm and about 2 mm by ultrafiltration with a YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Inc.) for electrochemical redox titration and EXAFS measurements, respectively. The gene encoding CooAΔN5 was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using pKK3CO5 (26Aono S. Nakajima H. Saito K. Okada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) as a template and the following primers: primer 1, 5′-AGGAGACTCGTATGAACATCGCCAATGTCCTGTTG-3′ and primer 2, 5′-TCATTAATCGTCGTCGTCGTCGCGGTC-3′. The PCR product containing the cooAΔN5 gene was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) to construct pCR-COΔN5. An expression vector of CooAΔN5, pKK-COΔN5, was constructed by inserting the EcoRI fragment containing the cooAΔN5 gene, which was cut from pCR-COΔN5, into the EcoRI site of pKK223-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The activity of CooAΔN5 was measured as reported previously (27Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The electrochemical experiments were made using an electrochemical cell equipped with a quartz optical cell (40 (height) × 10 (width) × 1 mm (thickness)). The optical path length of the optical cell was 1 mm. A working electrode of gold mesh (40 × 9 × 0.7 mm) was immersed in the optical cell. A platinum wire and Ag2+/AgCl (3 m KCl) electrodes (RE-1B, BSA) were used as auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively. The potential was controlled by a potentiostat (HA-301, Hokuto Denko Co.). The electronic absorption spectra were measured on a U-3300 Hitachi uv/vis spectrophotometer.

CooA solution containing the mediator dyes was repeatedly degassed and flushed with argon prior to the measurement and then ∼2.5 ml of the sample solution was transferred into the electrochemical cell, which was sealed by a rubber septum, by using a gas-tight syringe under argon atmosphere. The electrochemical cell was kept in a thermoelectric cell holder of a U-3300 Hitachi uv/vis spectrophotometer at 15 °C during the electrochemical titration. The redox reaction of CooA was followed by recording the absorbance change in the regions of the Soret and Q bands. EXAFS spectra at the iron K-edge were measured at liquid nitrogen temperature using monochromatized synchrotron radiation at the BL 12C of the Photon Factory in the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (Tsukuba, Japan). The EXAFS spectra were measured as fluorescence excitation spectra using a bent cylinder type focusing mirror and a silicon (111) double-crystal monochromator. The sample was placed at an angle of 45 degrees against the incident x-ray beam, and the fluorescent x-ray intensity perpendicular to the beam was measured using a solid state 19-element detector (Canberra Industries, Inc.) The analysis of the EXAFS data was performed using the program XFIT (43Ellis P.J. Freeman H.C. J. Synchrotron Rad. 1995; 2: 190-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as previously reported (44Rich A.M.

To date, the sixth ligand of the ferric and ferrous hemes in CooA is not known, whereas Cys75 and His77 are assigned to be the fifth ligand of the ferric and ferrous hemes, respectively (29Aono S.

We have reported that His, Met, Cys, and Lys are not candidates for the axial ligands of the heme in CooA, except for Cys75 and His77 (29Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To identify the unknown ligand of the heme in CooA, we carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis on all Arg, Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues in the heme-binding domain of CooA in the present work. These side chains could potentially coordinate to the heme iron, located in the N-terminal region from Met1to Met131 (27Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mutant CooA proteins constructed in this work are summarized in Table I. The individual mutant proteins were partially purified by means of a Q-Sepharose column and their uv/vis spectra were measured in the ferric, ferrous, and CO-bound forms. All the mutants thus prepared exhibited almost the same electronic absorption spectra as did wild-type CooA (data not shown), indicating that no candidate for the sixth ligand of the heme in CooA was found by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. 2Among the mutants constructed in this work, N6A and D72A CooA showed a slightly blue-shifted Soret peak at 420 nm in the ferric state, whereas the ferrous and CO-bound spectra of these mutants were identical to those of wild-type CooA. However, when Asn6 or Asp72 was replaced by Met, the resulting mutants showed almost the same electronic absorption spectra in the ferric, ferrous, and CO-bound forms as those of wild-type CooA. These results suggest that side chains of any amino acid residues, except for Cys75 and His77, do not coordinate to the heme iron as an axial ligand in CooA.Table IMutant CooA proteins constructed in this workTarget residuesMutant proteinsArgR4A, R21A, R24A, R51A, R53A, R61A, R87A, R91A, R96A, R118A, R125AAspD15A, D40A, D49A, D72A, D94A, D129AGluE17A, E38A, E41A, E59A, E60A, E62A, E83A, E86A, E89A, E99A, E128AAsnN6A, N9A, N42AGlnQ100A, Q103ASerS13A, S25A, S32A, S64A, S70A, S78A, S107A, S122AThrT18A, T36A, T69A, T85A, T88A, T97A, T104A, T121A, T126ATyrY55F, Y67FThe numbers in the Table stand for the positions of the residues at which the mutation was introduced.

The individual residues were replaced by Ala in these mutants except for Tyr. For the Y55F and Y67F mutants, Tyr was replaced by Phe. To elucidate whether or not the amino group of the amino-terminal residue is coordinated to the heme in CooA, a truncated mutant (CooAΔN5), in which four residues were deleted from the amino-terminal of CooA, was constructed and its electronic absorption spectra and transcriptional activator activity were measured. The amino-terminal amino acid sequences of wild-type and CooAΔN5, which were deduced from the DNA sequences, are1MPPRFNIANV and 1MNIANV, respectively. The four underlined residues in this sequence were deleted in CooAΔN5. CooAΔN5 showed the Soret peak at 422, 424, and 422 nm in the ferric, ferrous, and CO-bound forms, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. The spectral features of CooAΔN5 were almost the same as the corresponding ones in the wild-type though the ferric CooAΔN5 showed a slightly blue-shifted and broad Soret peak with a shoulder at 399 nm compared with wild-type. The shoulder at 399 nm and a CT-band at 638 nm in the spectrum of ferric CooAΔN5 suggest that a high-spin form of the ferric heme exists to some extent in ferric CooAΔN5. The transcriptional activator activity of CooAΔN5 was 13.2 and 0.29 units/mg of protein in the presence or absence of CO, respectively. These values were comparable with those for wild-type CooA; the activity of wild-type CooA is 15.7 and 0.23 units/mg of protein in the presence or absence of CO, respectively (27Aono S. Matsuo T. Shimono T. Ohkubo K. Takasaki H. Nakajima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). CooAΔN5 was also a CO-dependent transcriptional activator as is wild-type CooA. The deletion of four amino acid residues from the amino-terminal of CooA did not perturb the electronic absorption spectra and CO-dependent transcriptional activator activity of CooAΔN5. A similar result has been reported recently for the different N-terminal truncated mutants of CooA (48Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Youn H. Staples C.R. Lanzilotta W.N. Poulos T.L.

The above results suggested that the first five residues from the amino terminus are not responsible for the coordination of the heme in CooA. However, this conclusion is now known to be incorrect. During the course of the reviewing process of this paper, Lanzilotta et al. (39Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) have reported the crystal structure of the reduced form of CooA in which His77 and the nitrogen atom from Pro2 are the axial ligands of the heme (39Lanzilotta W.N.

Though Pro2 is deleted in CooAΔN5, CooAΔN5 showed almost the same uv/vis spectra and activity as those of wild-type CooA. These results indicate that some compensation for the mutation takes place to maintain CooAΔN5 in order to have a six-coordinate heme and to be active as the CO-dependent transcriptional activator. However, it is not known at present what is coordinated to the heme in place of Pro2 in the case of CooAΔN5. To analyze the coordination atoms of th"

Its nuclear accumulation was recently shown to be under the control of TOR signaling. Gln3p normally resides in the cytoplasm. When cells are starved from nitrogen nutrients or treated with rapamycin, however, Gln3p becomes translocated into the nucleus, thereby activating the expression of genes involved in nitrogen utilization and transport. To identify other genes under the control of Gln3p, we searched for the Gln3p-binding GATAA motifs within 500 base pairs of the promoter sequences upstream of the yeast open reading frames in theSaccharomyces Genome Database. APG14, a gene essential for autophagy, was found to have the most GATAA motifs. We show that nitrogen starvation or rapamycin treatment rapidly causes a more than 20-fold induction of APG14. The expression ofAPG14 is dependent on Gln3p; deletion of Gln3p severely reduced its induction by rapamycin, whereas depletion of Ure2p caused its constitutive expression. However, overexpression ofAPG14 led to only a slight increase in autophagy in nitrogen-rich medium. Therefore, these results define a signaling cascade leading to the expression of APG14 in response to the availability of nitrogen nutrients and suggest that the regulated expression of APG14 contributes to but is not sufficient for the control of autophagy.

FKBP12-rapamycin-binding nitrogen catabolite repression untranslated region alcohol dehydrogenase yeast extract-peptone-dextrose In response to nutrient starvation conditions, particularly nitrogen starvation, autophagy acts as an emergency measure to generate an internal supply of nutrients. It may also serve to reduce energy-consuming cellular activities, such as protein synthesis, by nonselectively delivering cytosolic materials to the lysosome (higher eukaryotes) or vacuole (yeast) for degradation (reviewed in Ref. 1Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Failure to undergo autophagy severely compromises the viability of cells during starvation. In addition, autophagy is also involved in selectively removing aged organelles such as mitochondria under normal growth conditions in higher eukaryotes. During autophagy, a portion of the cytoplasm is sequestered by a double- or multilayered membrane structure referred to as the autophagosome or autophagy body. Autophagosomes are then transported to and fused with the lysosome or vacuole, resulting in the eventual degradation of cytoplasmic materials by the lysosomal or vacuolar proteases (reviewed in Ref. 1Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Genetic approaches have been undertaken to identify the players involved in autophagy. A number of autophagy (APG orAUT) genes have been identified that are required for autophagy (2Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 3Thumm M. Egner R. Koch B. Schlumpberger M. Straub M. Veenhuis M. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In a separate genetic screen for genes involved in cytoplasm to vacuole targeting, it was found that there is an overlap of many common components between the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting and autophagy pathways (4Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Emerging biochemical evidence indicates that the autophagy genes are involved in various steps in the formation and delivery of autophagosomes. For example, Apg6p/Vps30p/Vpt30p/Lph7p and Apg14p form a peripheral membrane-associated complex. No autophagosomes were observed in the vacuoles of apg6Δ or apg14Δ cells (5Kametaka S. Okano T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22284-22291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus the Apg6p-Apg14p complex appears to be involved in the initial step(s) of autophagy. Apg6p has a dual role in both autophagy and vacuolar protein sorting, whereas Apg14p appears to be designated solely for autophagy. Overexpression of Apg14p can suppress the defect ofapg6Δ in autophagy but not vacuolar protein sorting (5Kametaka S. Okano T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22284-22291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Apg8p/Aut7p/Cvt5p forms a complex with Apg4p/Aut2p, a microtubule-binding protein (6Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 7Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Mutations in APG4 orAPG8 cause the accumulation of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the Apg4p-Apg8p complex is responsible for the delivery of autophagosomes to the vacuole. Once autophagosomes are fused with the lysosome/vacuole, vacuolar acidification by the vacuolar H+-ATPase is required for the activity of vacuolar proteases (e.g. Cps1p and Prb1p) to break down the cytosolic materials into small molecules such as amino acids, resulting in the eventual disappearance of autophagosomes (reviewed in Refs. 1Klionsky D.J.

Autophagy has long been morphologically associated with a variety of human disorders. Elevated autophagy is seen in several human degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (9Cataldo A.M. Hamilton D.J. Barnett J.L. Paskevich P.A. Nixon R.A. J.

Müllauer L. Schulte-Hermann R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Beclin 1 is a Bcl-2-interacting protein and the human homolog of Apg6p. It complements the autophagic but not the vacuolar protein-sorting function of Apg6p in yeast (12Liang X.H. Saadlya J. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar).beclin 1 is frequently deleted in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers, and its expression level is significantly decreased in human breast epithelial carcinoma cell lines and tissues (12Liang X.H.

Cayanis E. Kalachikov S. Gilliam T.C. Levine B. Genomics. 1999; 59: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Overexpression of beclin 1 leads to elevated autophagy, reduced proliferation of cancer cells, inhibition of in vitro clonigenicity, and tumorigenesis in nude mice (12Liang X.H. Saadlya J. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the Apg6p-Apg14p complex plays an important role in the regulation of autophagy. Rapamycin is a macrocyclic immunosuppressive antibiotic that inhibits the growth of eukaryotic cells. The targets of rapamycin (TOR) genes,TOR1 and TOR2, were initially isolated for their dominant mutations causing rapamycin resistance (14Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N.

It was later shown that FKBP12-rapamycin directly binds to TOR and that their dominant rapamycin-resistant mutations at a conserved serine residue, Ser-1972 in Tor1p or Ser-1975 in Tor2p, disrupt the binding of FKBP12-rapamycin (17Stan R.

The binding of FKBP12-rapamycin to TOR is mediated by a small 12-kDa domain called the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB1) domain (18Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L.

A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the FKBP12-rapamycin-FRB complex shows that the conserved serine residue is located in the hydrophobic rapamycin-binding pocket of FRB (21Choi J. Chen J. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1996; 273: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). A substitution of the conserved serine with a bulky amino acid prevents the binding of rapamycin to the hydrophobic pocket. TOR proteins are highly conserved evolutionarily and belong to the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-related kinase family (reviewed recently in refs. 22Dennis P.B. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Curr.

In addition, rapamycin treatment also causes elevated autophagy in mammalian cells, indicating that the ability of TOR to regulate autophagy is conserved.

The inhibition of TOR by rapamycin causes the dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Gln3p (31Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol.

Ure2p is a pre-prion protein genetically identified as an inhibitor of Gln3p (reviewed in Ref. 30Magasanik B. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992: 283-318Google Scholar). Ure2p binds to Gln3p and appears to inhibit the dephosphorylation step of Gln3p (31Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The depletion of Ure2p also leads to the dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Gln3p (31Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). TOR signaling is also implicated in the regulation of several other transcription factors. It binds to Gat1p, Gzf3p, Dal80p, Dal81p, and Dal82p (31Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Rapamycin treatment also causes nuclear accumulation of Gat1p, Msn2p, and Msn4p (32Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In this study, we performed a DNA pattern search for the potential target genes of Gln3p. We found that APG14 is among three genes with the largest number of Gln3p-binding motifs (GATAA). We further showed that the inhibition of TOR by rapamycin or nitrogen starvation leads to the rapid induction of APG14 in a Gln3p-dependent manner. Interestingly, the overexpression of APG14 itself only caused a slightly increased level of autophagy. These observations defined a signaling cascade leading to the expression of APG14 in response to nitrogen starvation. They showed that regulated expression of APG14may contribute to but is not sufficient for the control of autophagy. The strains and plasmids were FM391 (MATa hisΔ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0) (a gift from M. Johnston) and SZy159 (FM391,ure2Δ::KanMX) (33Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), SZy415 (FM391,pho8Δ60), and SZy426 (SZy159,pho8Δ60). The PHO8 in the SZy strains was replaced with pho8Δ60 by inserting the plasmid pTN9 (a gift from Dr. Y. Ohsumi) into the PHO8locus and excised out as previously described (38Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). TheAPG14 open reading frame was cloned into pAUD6 plasmid with a Myc epitope tag in front of the starting codon ATG. Exponential wild type and mutant yeast cultures were treated with 200 nm rapamycin or drug vehicle. Aliquots of yeast cultures were withdrawn at different times. For nitrogen and carbon starvation, logarithmic cells in the synthetic complete medium were switched to synthetic complete minus nitrogen sources or carbon sources, and samples were withdrawn at different times. Total yeast RNAs were prepared using the freezing phenol extraction method (39Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total yeast RNA samples were separated on denaturing agarose gels, transferred onto nylon filters, hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes, and detected by a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Log-phase yeast cells were harvested and lysed with glass beads in disruption buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by vortexing. For Western blot analysis, 10 μg of protein samples were used for gel electrophoresis and detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with monoclonal antibody 9E10. Exponential wild type and mutant yeast cells were treated with rapamycin or a drug carrier (methanol) in the presence or absence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of yeast cultures were withdrawn and analyzed for the appearance of autophagosomes by a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a Nomarski objective lens and a SPOT digital camera system (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Consistent with a previous finding (36Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), we found that phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride treatment alone did not cause autophagy but significantly enlarged the size of autophagosomes, which is convenient for the analysis of autophagy. The assay basically followed that described by Noda et al. (38Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were harvested in phosphatase buffer (PB, 250 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgSO4, and 10 μmZnSO4), disrupted with glass beads, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The protein concentrations of the yeast extracts were measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Fifty μg of protein were incubated with 25 mm α-naphthyl phosphate (Sigma) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 2 m glycine-NaOH (pH 11.0) and measured by the fluorescence intensity of emissions at 472 nm after excitation at 345 nm. Recent gene expression profiling analysis has revealed that the inhibition of TOR by rapamycin leads to a rapid global change in the expression of NCR-sensitive genes as well as other diverse yeast genes (31Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 34Cardenas M. Cutler N. Lorenz M. Di Como C. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Gln3p plays a broader role in the control of gene expression beyond NCR-sensitive genes. To identify new target genes for Gln3p, we carried out a pattern search for the Gln3p-binding motif GATAA in 500 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of yeast open reading frames. This approach was inspired by the observation that Gln3p-dependent genes often contain multiple GATAA motifs in their 5′-UTR (reviewed in Ref. 30Magasanik B. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992: 283-318Google Scholar). MEP2,APG14, and YOR142w are found to each contain eight GATAA motifs, the largest number in the entire yeast genome (TheAPG14 5′-UTR is shown in Fig.1 a). MEP2 encodes for ammonia transporter previously shown to be under the control of Gln3p (31Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition, two other Gln3p-dependent, NCR-sensitive genes, AMD2 (amidase) and DAL5(allantoate permease), contain seven GATAA motifs. Therefore, multiple GATAA motifs in the 5′-UTR appear to be a good indicator for potential Gln3p-dependent genes. TOR has been linked to the control of autophagy and regulation of Gln3p. APG8 was also recently shown to be inducible by nitrogen starvation (7Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 35Huang W.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5845-5851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and rapamycin (Ref. 33Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar and Footnote 2). ThusAPG14 is a likely Gln3p target gene and therefore is controlled by TOR signaling. To confirm this, we performed Northern blot analysis of logarithmically growing cells in YPD treated with 200 nm rapamycin. In the absence of rapamycin, the transcript of APG14 was essentially undetectable. However, rapamycin treatment a caused rapid increase in APG14expression that peaked within 10 min and gradually declined to the basal level after 60 min (Fig. 1 b). In contrast, the expression of ACT1 remained largely unchanged. Even at its maximal expression, the level of APG14 transcripts remained very low. A common problem with recent gene profiling technologies is that they often fail to detect low-abundant transcripts. This may explain why several recent studies were unable to reveal the induction of APG14 by rapamycin (31Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 34Cardenas M. Cutler N. Lorenz M. Di Como C. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). A closer look at the 500-base pair 5′-UTR region of APG14 revealed the open reading frame for OPY1 at the −238 position. After taking the OPY1 sequences into consideration, only two of the eight GATAA sequences actually fall between OPY1 andAPG14. It remains to be determined whether these two GATAA sequences are sufficient for the regulation of APG14. To confirm that the above rapamycin effects were attributable to the inhibition of TOR, we examined the expression of APG14 in cells carrying a plasmid-borne wild type TOR1 or a dominant rapamycin-resistant (RR) TOR1 RR (18Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Rapamycin caused elevated expression of APG14 in cells carrying the wild type TOR1 but not the TOR1 RRcells (Fig. 1 c). Thus the inhibition of TOR by rapamycin is directly responsible for the induction of APG14. Because phosphorylation of Gln3p by TOR is important for the cytoplasmic retention and inhibition of Gln3p, we also examined whether an intact TOR kinase domain is required for the repression of APG14. In this experiment, wild type yeast cells carrying a plasmid-borneTOR1(S1972I,D2294E) were used (Fig. 1 c).TOR1(S1972I, D2294E) contains two independent point mutations: the S1972I mutation in the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain that prevents the binding of FKBP12-rapamycin and the D2294E mutation located at a critical site of the kinase catalytic domain that completely abolishes the kinase activity of Tor1p (18Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Even though FKBP12-rapamycin is unable to bind to Tor1p(S1972I,D2294E), Tor1p(S1972I,D2294E) failed to repress the induction ofAPG14 in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 1 c). Thus an intact kinase domain of TOR is required for the normal repression of APG14. TOR has been implicated in the control of a large number of transcription factors, including Gln3p, Gat1p, Gzf3p, Dal80p, Dal81p, Dal82p (31Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), Msn2p, and Msn4p (32Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Because Gln3p, Dal80p, and Gat1p are GATA-type transcription factors, we asked whether they are involved in the expression of APG14. We found that the deletion ofGLN3 severely reduced APG14 expression in the presence of rapamycin (Fig. 2). A residual expression of APG14 in the absence of Gln3p appears to be mediated by Gat1p (data not shown). Ure2p is the inhibitor of Gln3p in the presence of preferred nitrogen sources. Rapamycin or the deletion of URE2 leads to the nuclear accumulation of Gln3p and constitutive expression of several Gln3p-dependent genes such as GAP1 and GLN1 (31Bertram P.G. Choi J. Carvalho J. Ai W.D. Zeng C.B. Chan T.F. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 32Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Similar toGAT1 and GLN1, the ure2Δ mutation led to the constitutive expression of APG14 in the absence of rapamycin (Fig. 2). Rapamycin treatment did not further increaseAPG14 expression in the ure2Δ strain (Fig. 2). Taken together, Gln3p is primarily responsible for mediating the induction of APG14 by rapamycin. The starvation of either nitrogen or carbon sources causes autophagy (reviewed in Ref. 1Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of deprivation of nitrogen nutrients on APG14. Similar to rapamycin treatment, we found that nitrogen starvation rapidly induced the expression ofAPG14 (Fig. 3). However, glucose starvation had no discernible change in the transcript levels of APG14 (Fig. 3). Similarly, switching from glucose to a nonfermentable carbon source also failed to induce the expression ofAPG14 (data not shown). These findings are consistent with our observation that glucose starvation did not significantly cause autophagy in the strains examined in this study (data not shown). Thus nitrogen, but not carbon, starvation causes elevated expression ofAPG14. The accumulation of autophagosomes in the yeast vacuole is a hallmark for cells undergoing autophagy and has been used as a convenient microscopic measurement of autophagy (36Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 37Straub M. Bredschneider M. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3875-3883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because rapamycin activates both Gln3p and autophagy, we investigated whether the activation of Gln3p is sufficient for autophagy. In this experiment, we chose to use the ure2Δ strain that contains the active form of Gln3p. Similar to rapamycin treatment, the deletion ofURE2 caused the accumulation of a large number of autophagosomes in nearly all the cells in a mid-log phase culture in YPD (Fig. 4, a andb). To confirm the above observation, we also performed a Pho8Δ60p-based alkaline phosphatase assay (38Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The alkaline phosphatase Pho8p is normally localized on the vacuolar membrane. Pho8Δ60p is instead localized in the cytoplasm because of the truncation of its transmembrane region and can only be delivered into the vacuole by autophagy. Once in the vacuole, Pho8Δ60p can be processed by vacuolar proteases and becomes the active form that can be detected by the alkaline phosphatase activity assay (38Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). As previously reported (29Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), alkaline phosphatase activity increased 2.9-fold by rapamycin treatment in the wild type yeast (Fig. 4 c). Theure2Δ mutation also caused an ∼2.3-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity over that in the wild type strain (Fig.4 c). Therefore, the activation of Gln3p by URE2deletion appears to cause autophagy at a level comparable with that by rapamycin. Apg14p forms a heterodimer with Apg6p. A recent study shows that overexpression of beclin 1, the human homolog of Apg6p, caused elevated autophagy in human breast carcinoma cells (12Liang X.H. Saadlya J. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). However, the level of APG6 remained largely unchanged in the presence and absence of rapamycin or nitrogen starvation (data not shown). Because APG14 is highly inducible by rapamycin, we examined whether the overexpression of APG14has any effect on autophagy. We engineered APG14 under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) promoter on a 2 μm plasmid. We found the presence of high steady state levels of APG14 mRNA (Fig.5 a) and protein (Fig.5 b) in cells carrying the ADH-APG14 but not in the vector control plasmid. The APG14 mRNA level is at least 5- to 10-fold more than the endogenousAPG14 mRNA induced by rapamycin (data not shown). In yeast cells expressing Apg14p, however, there was only a slight increase in the autophagy level over the control cells (Fig. 5,c and d). This is in contrast to the rapamycin-treated wild type cells or the untreated ure2Δ cells (Fig. 4). Therefore, the induction of APG14 does not appear to be sufficient for autophagy. Other factor(s) under the control of the Gln3p pathway must also be involved. Autophagy is a cellular process that nonselectively delivers cytosolic materials to the lysosome (higher eukaryotes) or vacuole (yeast) for degradation (reviewed in Ref. 1Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). It can generate an internal supply of nutrients and is essential for cell viability during starvation. Because autophagy nonselectively degrades many cytosolic materials such as ribosomes, it is not desirable under normal growth conditions. Not surprisingly, autophagy is a highly regulated process; it occurs at very low levels when cells are growing in nutrient-rich medium but at high levels during starvation. Cancer cells appear to have developed a strategy to gain growth advantage by deletingbeclin1/APG6 and decreasing their autophagy levels (12Liang X.H. Saadlya J. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to understand the control ofAPG genes and the regulatory circuit of autophagy. Biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that the APGgenes play critical roles in the formation and transport of autophagosomes (reviewed in Ref. 1Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Mutations in these genes prevent yeast from forming autophagosomes or delivering them to the vacuole during starvation. A recent study establishes that TOR plays an important role in the control of autophagy (29Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Rapamycin treatment or compromise in both TOR1 and TOR2 genes leads to high levels of autophagy in the absence of starvation. In this study, we discovered that the 500-base pair upstream region ofAPG14 is highly abundant in Gln3p-binding sites (Fig.1 a). Further investigation shows that APG14 is indeed highly inducible by nitrogen starvation or rapamycin treatment (Figs. 1b and 3). The expression of APG14 is primarily under the control of Gln3p; the deletion of GLN3 severely reduced APG14 expression by rapamycin, whereas activation of Gln3p by the ure2Δ mutation led to the constitutive expression of APG14. Our results also show that the inhibition of TOR kinase activity is necessary for the induction ofAPG14. Apg6p and Apg14p form a peripheral membrane-bound complex (5Kametaka S. Okano T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22284-22291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Earlier studies indicate that this protein complex is critical for autophagy. The deletion of either APG6 or APG14 completely inhibits autophagy. In contrast, the overexpression of beclin 1, the human homolog of Apg6p, promotes autophagy in human breast carcinoma cells (12Liang X.H. Saadlya J. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar). Apg6p has a dual function in both autophagy and vacuolar sorting in yeast. In contrast, Apg14p is specific for autophagy (5Kametaka S. Okano T. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22284-22291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Unlike mammalian cells, we found that the transcript level of APG6 remained unchanged during starvation or rapamycin treatment. In contrast, APG14 is highly induced under these conditions. Because the overexpression of beclin 1 leads to a significant increase in autophagy, we examined the effect of APG14 overexpression on autophagy in yeast. Unlike the ure2Δ mutation or rapamycin treatment, which leads to autophagy in virtually all cells (Fig. 4) (29Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar), we found thatAPG14 overexpression only slightly increased autophagy (Fig.5, c and d). Thus additional factor(s) appear to contribute to the onset of autophagy. Apg8p may be one such protein. The abundance of APG8 increased approximately 8-fold following the starvation of nitrogen nutrients (7Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 35Huang W.P. Scott S.V. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5845-5851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The expression of APG8 also increased similarly as a result of rapamycin treatment (data not shown) (33Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We also found that Gln3p is responsible for the expression of APG8 (data not shown). Apg8p interacts with Apg4p, a microtubule-associated protein (6Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Theapg4Δ and apg8Δ mutations cause the accumulation of autophagosomes in the cytoplasm, suggesting that Apg4p or Apg8p is responsible for the delivery of the autophagosomes to the vacuole (6Lang T. Schaeffeler E. Bernreuther D. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 7Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M.

However, when human αX is paired with chicken or mouse β2, αXβ2 is activated for binding to iC3b. Activating substitutions were mapped to individual residues or groups of residues in the N-terminal plexin/semaphorin/integrin (PSI) domain and C-terminal cysteine-rich repeats 2 and 3. These regions are linked by a long range disulfide bond. Substitutions in the PSI domain synergized with substitutions in the cysteine-rich repeats. Substitutions T4P, T22A, Q525S, and V526L gave full activation. Activation of binding to iC3b correlated with exposure of the CBR LFA-1/2 epitope in cysteine-rich repeat 3. The data suggest that the activating substitutions are present in an interface that restrains the human αX/human β2 integrin in the inactive state. The opening of this interface is linked to structural rearrangements in other domains that activate ligand binding.

On cells that coexpress the integrins αXβ2 and Mac-1 (αMβ2), stronger cellular activation is required to activate αXβ2 than αMβ2 for binding to the ligand iC3b (8Myones B.L. Dalzell J.G. Hogg N. Ross G.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 640-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). When transfected into COS or 293T cells, the integrins LFA-1 (αLβ2) and αMβ2are active in binding ligands; however, αXβ2 is not (14Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Construction of chimeric αM and αX α subunits showed that many reciprocal exchanges activated ligand binding, suggesting that structural perturbations released restraints that otherwise held αXβ2 in an inactive state (14Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although αXβ2 expressed on COS-7 cells could not bind to the ligand iC3b, an interspecies hybrid, αXβ2, comprised of chicken β2and human αX subunits was constitutively active in binding iC3b (7Bilsland C.A.G. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, human αM/chicken β2 and human αM/human β2integrin heterodimers bound iC3b equally well. Studies with mAb1 map ligand binding to the I domain of the αXβ2 αXsubunit (7Bilsland C.A.G. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that an intersubunit restraint on αX conformation is loosened with the chicken β2 subunit so that αX can more readily adopt the conformation that binds iC3b. It may be significant in light of this finding and the finding that αXβ2is more difficult to activate than αLβ2 or αMβ2 that the association between αX and β2 is more difficult to disrupt with denaturing conditions than the association between αL and β2 or between αM and β2(15Sanchez-Madrid F. Nagy J. Robbins E. Simon P. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). A key question of current integrin research is the nature of the structural alterations in “inside-out signaling” that enables ligand binding by the extracellular domain in response to signals impinging on the cytoplasmic/transmembrane domains. Electron microscopy reveals an overall integrin structure of a globular head region connected to the cell membrane by two stalk regions (16Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The head region binds ligand and contains domains from the N-terminal portions of both the α and β subunits. Seven 60-amino acid repeats in the N-terminal half of the α subunit have been predicted to fold into a β-propeller domain (17Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A subset of integrin α subunits, including the αX subunit, contains an I domain inserted between β-sheets 2 and 3 of the β-propeller domain. The I domain has a structure like small G proteins with a metal ion-dependent adhesion site at the top of the domain where ligand is bound (18Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.

Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). A conformational change at the MIDAS that regulates ligand binding is linked structurally to a large movement of the C-terminal α-helix that connects the bottom of the I domain to the β-propeller domain (19Emsley J.

This β subunit I-like domain associates with the side of the α subunit β-propeller domain at β-sheets 2 and 3 (27Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol.

The stalk regions provide the crucial link between the signals impinging on the α and β subunit transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and the conformational changes that occur in the ligand-binding head region. In the α subunit, the stalk region appears to consist of the region C-terminal to the predicted β-propeller domain. The stalk region is predicted to consist of domains with a two-layer β-sandwich structure (29Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15138-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Four subregions of the αM stalk have been defined with mAb epitopes, three of which react with mAbs whether or not the β subunit is coexpressed. In the β subunit, the stalk region appears to consist of the cysteine-rich regions that precede and follow the I-like domain, i.e. residues 1–103 and 342–678 in β2. These cysteine-rich regions are linked by a long range disulfide bond defined in β3 that is predicted to link Cys-3 and Cys-425 in β2 (30Calvete J.J. Henschen A. González-Rodrı́guez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The N-terminal cysteine-rich region of residues ∼1–50 shares sequence homology with membrane proteins including plexins, semaphorins, and the c-met receptor (31Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This region has two predicted α-helices and has been termed the “PSI domain” forplexins, semaphorins, andintegrins. The segment from residues 425 to 590 has a cysteine content of 20% and is composed of four cysteine-rich repeats. The first repeat is less similar to the others and at its N-terminal end contains the cysteine that disulfide bonds to the PSI domain. Several monoclonal antibodies that activate integrins or report conformational changes have been mapped to the C-terminal region of the β subunit that includes the cysteine-rich repeats (28Zang Q.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Many of these mAbs recognize epitopes that become exposed after integrin activation. One of these, mAb KIM127 to the β2 subunit, is not dependent on association with the α subunit for reactivity and indeed reacts better with the free β2 subunit than with the integrin αβ heterodimer (38Huang C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, structural changes in the stalk region that include exposing antibody epitopes on the integrin β subunit are associated with integrin activation. Here, we have defined regions of the integrin β2 subunit involved in regulating ligand binding by αXβ2. Ligand binding is activated when the human αX subunit is complexed with the chicken β2 subunit (7Bilsland C.A.G. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this reflects a release of structural contacts between the human αX and human β2 subunits that normally restrain αXβ2 in a nonligand binding conformation. To map these contacts within the β2 subunit, we have utilized chicken/human β2 chimeras. We map the key differences and provide direct evidence that residues that restrain ligand binding by β2 are present in both the N-terminal cysteine-rich PSI domain and the C-terminal cysteine-rich repeats. 293T cells (human renal epithelial transformed cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The mouse anti-human αX mAb CBRp150/2E1 (7Bilsland C.A.G. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar) and the anti-human β2 mAbs KIM185 (39Andrew D. Shock A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Chimeras and substitution mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction overlap extension (42Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5′ and 3′ end primers were designed to include unique restriction sites. Mutations were introduced by a pair of inner complementary primers. After a second round of polymerase chain reaction, the products were digested and ligated with the corresponding predigested plasmids. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids for transfection were purified by QIAprep Spin Kit or Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). 293T cells were transiently transfected with human αX and wild-type or mutant β2 constructs using calcium phosphate (43Heinzel S.S. Krysan P.J. Calos M.P. DuBridge R.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3738-3746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell.

Cells were washed twice with L15 medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum (L15/FBS). Cells (106) were incubated with 50 μl of primary antibody (20 μg/ml purified mAb, or 1:100 dilution of ascites) on ice for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with L15/FBS, followed by incubation with 50 μl of a 1:20 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 30 min on ice. After washing three times with L15/FBS, cells were resuspended in 200 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Antigen expression is presented as mean fluorescence intensity of cells. As described previously (7Bilsland C.A.G. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar, 14Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar)), sheep erythrocytes (Colorado Serum Co., Denver, CO) were washed, resuspended to 6 × 108 cells/10 ml in buffer 1 (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and 1 mm MgCl2), and sensitized with 80 μl of IgM anti-Forssman mAb M1/87 culture supernatant for 1 h at room temperature (E-IgM). The cells were then washed and resuspended in 1.8 ml of buffer 2 (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 15 mmHEPES, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmCaCl2), supplemented with 200 μl of C5-deficient human serum (Sigma). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the resulting E-IgM-iC3b were washed twice and resuspended in 6 ml of buffer 2. To assay the binding of αXβ2 to iC3b, 293T cells transfected with recombinant αXβ2were plated on 12-well polylysine-coated plates for at least 4 h prior to the experiment. After washing with buffer 2, the cells were incubated together with 200 μl of E-IgM-iC3b for 30 min at 37 °C. Unbound erythrocytes were removed by washing three times, and rosettes (>10 erythrocytes/293T cell, >100 cells examined) were scored with microscopy. To locate regions in the integrin β2 subunit that restrain activation of αXβ2, interspecies human/chicken chimeric β2 subunits were made. Chimeras were named according to the species origin of their segments. For example, h103c indicates that residues 1 to 103 are human and residues 104 to the C-terminal end are chicken. Each construct was cotransfected with the human αX subunit into 293T cells. Proper expression was confirmed by immunostaining with antibody CBRp150/2E1 to the αX subunit. All human/chicken β2chimeras studied here were expressed as well as human β2in αXβ2 complexes. The percentage of 293T transfectants expressing αXβ2 ranged from 68 to 85% for chimeras and wild type in all experiments described below. Transfectants were assayed for activation of ligand binding by rosetting with erythrocytes sensitized with iC3b (E-IgM-iC3b). The percentage of rosetting cells was normalized to the percentage of αXβ2+ cells for each construct. Transfectants expressing hybrid αXβ2 (human αX/chicken β2) but not transfectants expressing human αXβ2 formed rosettes with E-IgM-iC3b, confirming previous observations with COS-7 cell transfectants (7Bilsland C.A.G. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar). The chimeras mapped activation of ligand binding by chicken β2 to two regions, residues 1–71 and residues 421–610 (Fig. 1). The importance of residues 421–610 was shown by activation of iC3b rosetting by chimeras h103c and h421c but not by chimeras h610c, h103c421h, and c71h610c. Residues 1–71 were not sufficient by themselves to activate iC3b binding as shown with chimera c71h; however, they augmented rosetting when present in combination with residues 421–610 (Fig. 1). Thus, with residues 421–610 of chicken origin in chimeras h103c and h421c, about 40% of transfectants rosetted with E-IgM-iC3b. With both residues 1–71 and 421–610 of chicken origin in chimeras c678h and c71h421c, about 80% of transfectants rosetted. This was the same level as with the wild-type chicken β2 subunit. Thus, activation was a synergistic effect of the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich regions of the chicken β2 subunit. We found that αXβ2 heterodimers containing human αX and mouse β2 subunits were activated for binding to iC3b almost as well as those containing human αX and chicken β2 subunits (Fig.2 A). Human/mouse β2 chimeras showed that the region containing residues 344–612 was activating (Fig. 2 A). The h98m chimera was less activating than mouse β2, suggesting that the N-terminal cysteine-rich region contributed to activation. Furthermore, the m122h, m163h, m254h, m302h, and m344h chimeras showed that the N-terminal cysteine-rich region was not sufficient for activation, similar to the results with the chicken β2 subunit. The activating region in the C-terminal cysteine-rich region in the mouse β2 subunit was defined with a further series of chimeras (Fig. 2 B). These narrowed activation by the C-terminal cysteine-rich region to residues 470–538 since chimera m122h470m was activating, whereas m122h538m was not (Fig.2B). Furthermore, residues in two different segments, 470–502 and 502–538, were activating because chimera m122h502m was partially activating, whereas m122h470m was fully activating, and m122h538m was not activating. Mapping of the C-terminal cysteine-rich repeat region of chicken β2 was refined with five further chicken/human chimeric β2 constructs. Each construct contained N-terminal residues 1–71 and various lengths of the C-terminal cysteine-rich repeats from chicken β2(Fig. 3 A). Rosetting of chimeras c71h446c, c71h470c, and c71h498c with E-IgM-iC3b was similar to that of wild-type chicken β2. However, chimeras c71h527c and c71h562c did not bind to iC3b. Therefore, residues within region 498–527 can activate binding to the ligand iC3b. Within the activating region defined in chicken β2 of 498–527, 11 residues differ between human and chicken. Groups of one to three chicken amino acid residues in this region were introduced into the human β2 subunit and their effect on binding to iC3b was examined (Fig. 3 B). In combination with chicken residues 1–71, four groups of amino acid substitutions were activating: Q510T/Y511F/E513D in repeat 2 and T516N/I517M, R521F/Y522H, and Q525S/V526L in repeat 3. Chimera c71h/Q525S/V526L was as active as chicken β2. The four activating groups of residues were also tested in the absence of any other chicken residues. In this situation, only the mutation Q525S/V526L was activating, and its activity was reduced compared with c71h/Q525S/V526L (Fig.3B). Mapping of the N-terminal cysteine-rich region was refined with three chicken/human chimeras that included different portions of the N-terminal region in combination with the synergistic C-terminal segment (Fig.4 A). All three β2 chimeras, c71h421c, c50h421c, and c29h421c, activated binding to E-IgM-iC3b to the same extent as chicken β2. Thus, residues within the first 29 amino acids of the β2subunit are sufficient to synergistically activate αXβ2. In region 1–29 of the β2 subunit, 11 residues differ between the human and chicken. Groups of these residues were substituted with chicken sequence in combination with the mutation Q525S/V526L in the C-terminal cysteine-rich region in each construct (Fig. 4 B). Most of the mutants rosetted E-IgM-iC3b no better than the parent Q525S/V526L mutant. However, mutants Q1A/T4P/Q525S/V526L and T4P/Q525S/V526L but not Q1A/Q525S/V526L were more active than Q525S/V526L, implicating the substitution T4P in activation. Similarly, mutants T22A/Q25K/Q525S/V526L and T22A/Q525S/V526L but not Q25K/Q525S/V526L were more active than Q525S/V526L, implicating T22A. Moreover, the combination of mutations T4P and T22A was even more active, and the mutant T4P/T22A/Q525S/V526L was as active as chicken β2 (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, four chicken residues, two each in the N-terminal and C-terminal cysteine-rich regions of β2, are sufficient to maximally activate iC3b rosetting by αXβ2. Several mAbs that activate β2 integrins map to the C-terminal cysteine-rich region of the β2 subunit (28Zang Q. Lu C. Huang C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22202-22212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 37Stephens P. Romer J.T. Spitali M. Shock A. Ortlepp S. Figdor C. Robinson M.K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mouse/human substitutions recognized by these mAbs map very near to the substitutions Q525S/V526L that activate αXβ2. Specifically, mAb KIM185 recognizes residues 581–604 and mAb CBR LFA-1/2 recognizes residues 534 and 536. 2C. Lu, M. Ferzly, J. Takagi, and T. A. Springer, manuscript in preparation. Recognition by mAb CBR LFA-1/2 correlates with the activation status of β2integrins; αLβ2 and αMβ2, which are active in 293T cell transfectants, are recognized well by CBR LFA-1/2, whereas αXβ2, which is inactive in 293T cells, is recognized poorly2 (Fig. 5). We examined the effect of activating mutations on expression of CBR LFA-1/2 and KIM185 epitopes (Fig. 5). The KIM185 epitope was expressed equally well by wild-type and mutant αXβ2. By contrast, activating mutations induced exposure of the CBR LFA-1/2 epitope (Fig. 5). The Q525S/V526L mutation partially exposed the CBR LFA-1/2 epitope, whereas the T4P/T22A/Q525S/V526L mutation maximally exposed the epitope, i.e. to the same level as seen with KIM185 mAb. Exposure of the CBR LFA-1/2 epitope correlated with activation of binding to iC3b (Fig. 5). Therefore, the mutations cause structural rearrangements in the stalk region that lead to exposure of the CBR LFA-1/2 epitope and are linked to activation of ligand binding. Furthermore, binding of the CBR LFA-1/2 and KIM185 mAbs demonstrates that the mutations do not disrupt the structure of the cysteine-rich repeats. Among the β2 integrins, αXβ2 is the most resistant to activation and to dissociation of its α and β subunits. Here, we have identified specific amino acid residues that restrain αXβ2 in a conformation in which it does not bind its ligand, iC3b. We extended previous observations with the chicken β2 subunit (7Bilsland C.A.G. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar) by showing that pairing of human αX with β2 from another species, the mouse, also activates binding to iC3b. Interspecies β2 subunit chimeras associated with human αX subunits demonstrated that the C-terminal cysteine-rich repeats from mouse or chicken were sufficient for partial activation and that the N-terminal cysteine-rich PSI domain was insufficient for activation but synergized with the C-terminal cysteine-rich repeats. Activating substitutions in the N-terminal region were localized within the PSI domain (Fig. 6). Human/chicken substitutions T4P and T22A each synergized with the C-terminal region and, when present together, gave augmented synergy. PSI domains in integrins contain six cysteines that form intradomain disulfide bonds and one cysteine that forms a long range interdomain disulfide (30Calvete J.J. Henschen A. González-Rodrı́guez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,31Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Each of the activating substitutions neighbors a cysteine residue (Fig. 6). The substitution T4P neighbors Cys-3, which forms the long range disulfide bond to Cys-425, which is at the beginning of the C-terminal cysteine-rich repeats (Fig. 6). Thus, the two regions in which activating substitutions are found, the PSI domain and cysteine-rich repeats, are linked by a disulfide bond and must be neighboring domains in the three-dimensional structure of the integrin β subunit. Activating substitutions within the C-terminal region localized to cysteine-rich repeats 2 and 3 (Fig. 6). One segment containing activating mouse substitutions localized wholly within repeat 2, whereas another included portions of repeats 2 and 3 (Fig. 6). Fine mapping of three groups of chicken substitutions that activated αXβ2 in synergy with chicken residues in the PSI domain showed that one group mapped to repeat 2 and two groups mapped to repeat 3 (Fig. 6). One pair of substitutions that was sufficient for activation of αXβ2, Q525S/V526L, mapped to repeat 3. We cannot exclude the presence of activating substitutions in repeat 1 because all chimeras in which repeat 1 was mouse or chicken also contained repeats 2 and 3 from mouse or chicken, which were activating by themselves. However, the segments following the PSI domain and preceding repeat 1 were not activating. Furthermore, repeat 4 and more C-terminal segments were not activating. The species-specific differences in repeat 4 are greater than in repeats 2 and 3 (Table I); therefore, an insufficiency of species-specific differences cannot explain the lack of activation by repeat 4.Table IC-terminal cysteine-rich repeats: variation between species and activationRepeatLengthHuman-chicken differencesHuman-mouse differencesActivating substitutionsresidues%%1364722ND1-aND, not determined.2532317+3393826+4394636−1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab What is the mechanism of integrin activation by species-specific substitutions in the PSI domain and cysteine-rich repeats 2 and 3? Many other observations suggest that integrins are restrained in their resting state in a conformation that does not bind ligand and that a wide variety of perturbations can activate ligand binding. Our results suggest that the PSI domain and cysteine-rich repeats 2 and 3 have an important function in restraining integrins in their resting, inactive state. These restraints are overcome when the α and β subunits are from different species; therefore, it appears that there are direct interactions between these β subunit domains and the α subunit that constrain integrins in the inactive configuration. The substitutions are unlikely to disrupt the overall conformation of these domains because they are naturally occurring variations between species. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mAb CBR LFA-1/2, which binds to species-specific residues in repeat 3,2 binds well when the activating mutations Q525S and V526L are present in repeat 3. Therefore, it appears that the activating mutations we have defined are within or near an interface between the β2 and αX subunits. The findings suggest that in resting integrins, there are contacts of the PSI domain and cysteine-rich repeats 2 and 3 with the α subunit and that these contacts help restrain ligand binding. It appears that certain species-specific substitutions disrupt this interaction and, thereby, lower the activation energy required for activation of ligand binding. Binding of iC3b by αXβ2 maps to the αX I domain (7Bilsland C.A.G. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4582-4589PubMed Google Scholar). Conformational shifts around the MIDAS in I domains regulate ligand binding and are linked to a large movement of the C-terminal α-helix of the I domain that connects to other integrin subunits (19Emsley J.

Biol. 2000; 7: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that an alteration in contacts in the stalk region between the α subunit and the PSI domain and the cysteine-rich repeats in the β subunit are linked to conformational rearrangements in the ligand-binding domains in the headpiece of integrins. The loss of the restraints that keep αXβ2in an inactive state appears to reflect an opening up of the αβ interface in the stalk region based on exposure of the epitope for the mAb CBR LFA-1/2. This mAb can activate integrins αLβ2 and αMβ2(40Petruzzelli L. Maduzia L. Springer T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 854-866PubMed Google Scholar). It showed little reactivity with wild-type αXβ2; however, introduction of activating amino acid substitutions Q525S/V526L in cysteine-rich repeat 3 exposed the CBR LFA-1/2 epitope, and addition of the T4P/T22A substitutions fully exposed the epitope. Exposure correlated with iC3b binding. The CBR LFA-1/2 mAb maps to residues 534 and 5362, and nearby residues 525 and 526, to which activating mutations map in repeat 3. It is unlikely that there is a significant conformational change in this repeat because its structure is constrained by four disulfide bonds. Therefore, we envision a movement apart or change in orientation of the α and β subunits that exposes the CBR LFA-1/2 epitope in repeat 3. Other studies also imply a structural restraint on integrin activation that is localized in the cysteine-rich regions of the β subunit. Activation of the integrin LFA-1 (αLβ2) expressed on COS cells was induced if the C-terminal cysteine-rich repeat region of the β2 subunit was replaced by that of β1 (45Douglass W.A. Hyland R.H.

Furthermore, disruption of the long range disulfide bond between the PSI domain and the cysteine-rich repeats resulted in increased ligand binding affinity of αIIbβ3 (47Liu C.Y. Sun Q.H. Wang R. Paddock C.M. Newman P.J. Blood. 1997; 90 (abstr.): 573Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment with reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol, induced the active conformation of β1 integrin (33Ni H. Li A. Simonsen N. Wilkins J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and increased platelet aggregation through the αIIbβ3 integrin (48Zucker M.B. Masiello N.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1984; 51: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently, an anti-β1 antibody with an activation-dependent epitope has been mapped to the N-terminal cysteine-rich region, suggesting a role of this region as a regulatory site for integrin activation (33Ni H.

A plausible explanation is that these mAbs selectively bind to the open conformation of the stalk region and thus stabilize integrins in this conformation and induce linked rearrangements in the ligand-binding domains. Indeed, activating mAbs to both the β1 and β2 cysteine-rich regions have been found to bind better to isolated β subunits than αβ complexes, implying that they favor an open conformation (26Huang C.

In contrast to domains in the globular headpiece of integrins, the stalk regions do not appear to directly bind ligand but instead appear to regulate ligand binding and to relay activation signals impinging on the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the integrin α and β subunits. We have identified specific amino acid residues in the PSI domain and cysteine-rich repeats 2 and 3 of the β subunit that form part of the interface between the α and β subunits in the stalk region that restrains conformational movements in the ligand-binding headpiece. It would be very interesting to learn which regions of the α subunit participate in this interface and the molecular details of how structural alterations are communicated from one domain to another in integrins.

The template for telomeric repeat synthesis is carried within the RNA component of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex. Telomerases can copy their internal templates with repeat addition processivity, reusing the same template multiple times in the extension of a single primer. For some telomerases, optimal repeat addition processivity requires high micromolar dGTP concentrations, a much higher dGTP concentration than required for processive nucleotide addition within a repeat. We have investigated the requirements for dGTP-dependent repeat addition processivity using recombinant Tetrahymena telomerase. By altering the template sequence, we show that repeat addition processivity retains the same dGTP-dependence even if dGTP is not the first nucleotide incorporated in the second repeat. Furthermore, no dNTP other than dGTP can stimulate repeat addition processivity, even if it is the first nucleotide incorporated in the second repeat. Using structural variants of dGTP, we demonstrate that the stimulation of repeat addition processivity is specific for dGTP base and sugar constituents but requires only a single phosphate group. However, all nucleotides that stimulate repeat addition processivity also inhibit or compete with dGTP incorporation into product DNA. By assaying telomerase complexes reconstituted with a variety of altered templates, we find that repeat addition processivity has an unanticipated template or product sequence specificity.

These telomeric repeats and their associated proteins are necessary and sufficient to distinguish a stable linear chromosome end from a highly unstable DNA break (reviewed in Ref. 1Zakian V.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1601-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). However, telomeres are incompletely replicated by DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. The resulting loss of telomeric repeats with cell proliferation induces senescence or apoptosis of cultured human primary cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Price C.M. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1999; 9: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Telomeric repeats eroded by proliferation can be restored by the enzyme telomerase, a specialized reverse transcriptase (RT)1 that uses a defined region within its integral RNA component to template telomeric repeat synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 3Nugent C.I. Lundblad V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1073-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 4Bryan T.M. Cech T.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Although telomerases in most organisms recognize only established telomeres as substrates, ciliate telomerases also recognize nontelomeric sites of developmentally programmed chromosome fragmentation. This ciliate telomerase chromosome healing activity is required to generate a transcriptionally competent macronucleus containing thousands of amplified, telomere-capped minichromosomes (reviewed in Ref. 5Coyne R.S. Chalker D.L. Yao M.-C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 557-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Most biochemical characterization of telomerase has been done in ciliate systems because of the relative abundance of enzyme (reviewed in Ref. 6Collins K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 187-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ciliate telomerases have been shown to catalyze at least three activities. In a standard reaction, the template is copied by successive dNTP additions to synthesize a telomeric repeat. Second, if dTTP is reduced or omitted, telomerase reiteratively copies a template cytidine residue to synthesize product DNA composed of poly(dG). This template slippage-dependent polynucleotide synthesis resembles that catalyzed by human immunodeficiency virus RT in the presence of MnCl2 and the absence of a complete set of dNTPs (7Ricchetti M. Buc H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14970-14983Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Finally, telomerase can catalyze nucleolytic cleavage of substrates or products. All of these nucleotide addition and removal activities appear to occur at the same active site. Endogenous Tetrahymena thermophila telomerase assayed in cell extracts can add hundreds of repeats to a single primer before product dissociation (8Greider C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4572-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This high degree of repeat addition processivity requires primer and product interaction with a template-independent substrate anchor site (9Collins K. Greider C.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1364-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10Lee M.S. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6586-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Under standard reaction conditions, a primer bound only by interaction at the template, such as T2G4, will be elongated to the template 5′-end but then will dissociate from the enzyme when dissociated from the template. In contrast, longer primers such as G4T2G4 or (G4T2)3 can remain bound at the anchor site even when dissociated from the template. With anchor site interaction, a product 3′-end released from the template 5′-end can reposition at the template 3′-end to allow processive repeat addition. Anchor site interaction also substantially decreases theK m for primer in vitro (9Collins K. Greider C.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1364-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 10Lee M.S. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6586-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recombinant Tetrahymena telomerase, composed of only the telomerase RNA and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) subunits that are essential for activity in vitro, demonstrates a more limited repeat addition processivity than the endogenous enzyme (11Collins K. Gandhi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike the endogenous enzyme, recombinant telomerase repeat addition processivity requires high micromolar dGTP concentrations, much higher than the submicromolar dGTP concentration required for processive nucleotide addition within a repeat. In this dGTP-dependence of repeat addition processivity, recombinantTetrahymena telomerase resembles the endogenousEuplotes aediculatus and Chinese hamster ovary cell telomerases (12Hammond P.W. Cech T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3698-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Maine I.P. Chen S. Windle B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15325-15332Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The extent of repeat addition processivity varies among telomerase enzymes of different species and also between telomerase complexes of the same species (14Greider C.W. Collins K. Autexier C. DePamphlis M. DNA Replication. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 619-638Google Scholar, 15Greene E.C. Shippen D.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It seems most likely that dGTP-stimulated repeat addition processivity is an inherent property of all telomerase RNPs, with the species-specific addition of other substrate anchor sites in a telomerase holoenzyme conferring the differences in repeat addition processivity observed. For all telomerases known to demonstrate repeat addition processivity, dGTP is the first nucleotide added to a product repositioned from the template 5′- to 3′-end. One possible model to explain the dGTP dependence of repeat addition processivity would be that the stimulatory dGTP binds at the active site and enhances the probability of its addition as the first nucleotide in the second repeat. Alternately, dGTP could interact with a site entirely separable from the active site to stimulate repeat addition processivity as previously suggested (12Hammond P.W. Cech T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3698-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Experimentally testable predictions can be made that discriminate these models. For example, if dGTP must be the first nucleotide to add to a repositioned product to observe dGTP-dependent repeat addition processivity, then altering the template residue dictating this nucleotide addition specificity should abrogate the dGTP-dependence of repeat addition processivity. On the other hand, if the dGTP interaction required for repeat addition processivity is independent of the template, any template sequence change allowing wild-type levels of product synthesis to the template 5′-end, rebinding of the product 3′-end at the template 3′-end and product-anchor site interaction should allow processive repeat addition stimulated by dGTP. Our data indicate that dGTP-stimulated repeat addition processivity is accomplished in a manner different from envisioned by either model above.

To express telomerase RNAs with the wild-type RNA 3′-end, plasmids were digested with Fok I and reprecipitated after organic extraction.

Equal masses of telomerase RNA-encoding plasmid and telomerase protein-encoding plasmid were combined for coupled transcription/translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega TNT). This produces roughly equimolar amounts of telomerase RNAs and TERT (about 10 nm). For the determination of relative activity in Table I, expression reactions were analyzed by Northern blot to verify comparable levels of telomerase RNAs and by immunoblot to verify comparable levels of TERT.

In the assay set quantitated here, C48U RNA expression was 2-fold more than that of the wild-type RNA. Because the relative percentage of each RNA that is active is unknown, values in the table were not normalized.1-c N.D. indicates not reliably determined due to particularly low repeat addition processivity. Open table in a new tab Activity assays were performed under conditions similar to those previously described for recombinantTetrahymena telomerase (11Collins K. Gandhi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Typically, 2 μl or less of reticulocyte lysate expression reaction was diluted to 10 μl in T2MG (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, ± 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) and used in a 20-μl final assay volume in 1× assay buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm spermidine). Nucleotides were included as indicated in the figure legends. DNA oligonucleotide primers were used at 1 μm final concentration unless otherwise specified. Assays were incubated at 30 °C for ∼1 h unless otherwise specified. Product DNA was extracted with phenol/cholorofom/isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with ammonium acetate, and resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis. In some experiments, a radiolabeled 80-nt oligonucleotide was added before extraction and precipitation as an internal control for sample recovery (see Fig. 7). Quantitation of product intensity was done by phosphorimager (Fuji). Relative product intensities were converted to relative molar amounts of product by normalizing for the number of incorporated dGTPs. The molar amount of second repeat addition product divided by the sum of the first and second repeat addition products is a measure of repeat addition processivity. For example, for primer (TG)8TTG, repeat addition processivity is determined as molar amount (primer +12)/(sum of primer +6 and primer +12). This calculation does not include the small amount of product lost by elongation with additional repeats, which is difficult to quantitate reliably and would not substantially affect the values obtained. Similar values for repeat addition processivity were obtained comparing first and second repeat addition products, second and third repeat addition products, or third and fourth repeat addition products. Also, repeat addition processivity values were similar when calculated from a 15 or 60 min reaction, indicating that use of these reaction times did not limit repeat addition processivity. Tetrahymena telomerase repeat addition processivity was assayed by elongation of an excess of the DNA primer (TG)8TTG in the presence of [32P]dGTP and dTTP. This primer binds with its 3′-end at the template 3′-end (Fig.1 A). Products with lengths of primer +1 to primer +6 can be synthesized in the addition of the first repeat (Fig. 1 A). Because primer is in greater than 1,000-fold excess over telomerase enzyme and telomerase products (data not shown), products longer than primer +6 derive from processive repeat addition. In 0.6 μm dGTP, which is sufficient for high nucleotide addition processivity within a repeat, recombinantTetrahymena telomerase added predominantly one repeat to each bound (TG)8TTG primer (Fig. 1 B,WT lane 0.6 μm dGTP). Because of differences in absolute dGTP concentration in different shipments of [32P]dGTP, some variation in the absolute repeat addition processivity attained with 0.6 μm dGTP assays containing only radiolabeled dGTP stock was observed (compare Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and 6). With increasing dGTP concentration, increasing repeat addition processivity allowed the elongation of some primers by many repeats before dissociation (Fig. 1 B, WT lanes 2.6–40 μm dGTP). Because unlabeled dGTP was added to dilute the radiolabeled dGTP stock for dGTP concentrations greater than 0.6 μm, dGTP specific activity was reduced as dGTP concentration increased, and product intensity decreased accordingly. However, if product intensity was adjusted for specific activity, the total amount of product was similar at all dGTP concentrations. In this study, we quantitated repeat addition processivity by determining the amount of first repeat addition product that was extended by addition of a second repeat on a molar basis (see “Materials and Methods”). For the wild-type enzyme reactions shown in Fig. 1, repeat addition processivity increased from 3.1% at 0.6 μm dGTP to 22% at 40 μm dGTP.Figure 2The repeat addition processivity of C48N enzymes is not stimulated by dCTP, dATP, or dTTP.

Alllanes are from the same exposure of a single gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The first nucleotide added to a product repositioned for processive repeat synthesis is templated by the RNA residue C-48. To assess the influence of this template position on repeat addition processivity, we created expression constructs encoding the altered telomerase RNAs C48G, C48U, and C48A. Coexpression of these RNAs with TERT produced recombinant telomerase enzymes, which still bound the (TG)8TTG primer at the template 3′-end (Fig.1 B). The C48N telomerases were assayed with [32P]dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP (C48G) or dATP (C48U). Initial elongation of the primer (TG)8TTG occurred by addition of dCTP (C48G), dATP (C48U), dTTP (C48A), or dGTP (WT). In 0.6 μm dGTP, repeat addition processivity was low for all enzymes (Fig. 1 B). If dGTP concentration was increased to 2.6, 10, or 40 μm, the repeat addition processivity of all C48N enzymes was stimulated (Fig. 1 B). The maximum attainable repeat addition processivity varied with template sequence (Table I). For example, the C48U and C48A enzymes had lower maximal repeat addition processivity than the C48G and WT enzymes (3.4 and 5.8% versus 14 and 22%). This is likely to originate from the reduced nucleotide addition processivity of the C48U and C48A enzymes, evident in the enhanced accumulation of mid-template dissociation products. This reduced nucleotide addition processivity is expected, based on the reduced stability of an A-U or T-A product-template hybrid compared with the wild-type G-C. Although maximal repeat addition processivity varied with template sequence, the concentration of dGTP required to stimulate maximal repeat addition processivity was similar for all C48N enzymes. We conclude that the dGTP concentration dependence of repeat addition processivity does not depend on the sequence of template position 48. Next, dGTP concentration was fixed at 0.6 μm whereas the concentration of the nucleotide cognate to template position 48 was varied from 0 to 125 μm (Fig.2). In no case did increasing the concentration of a dNTP other than dGTP stimulate repeat addition processivity, even if nucleotide concentration was raised to the threshold at which telomerase activity was inhibited nonspecifically (data not shown). In the absence of the dNTP cognate to template position 48, none of the altered templates allowed substantial incorporation of [32P]dGTP (Fig. 2, lanes 0 μm dNTP). This establishes that dGTP was not misincorporated by the C48G, C48U, and C48A enzymes at template position 48, which could have allowed a dGTP-stimulated repeat addition processivity still requiring the first nucleotide addition of dGTP. Trace product synthesis with C48G enzyme in the absence of dCTP may derive from incorporation of dTTP at the template position 48G, whereas the primer-sized product of C48A synthesized in the absence of dTTP derives from cleavage and readdition of the primer 3′G, templated by either 43C or 49C. From the assays in Fig. 2, we conclude that the first nucleotide added to a template-repositioned product does not determine the nucleotide dependence of repeat addition processivity. In the experiments described above, a surprising lack of correlation was observed between the relative activity level and the relative repeat addition processivity directed by different template sequences. Based on product intensity, the C48U enzyme outperformed the wild-type enzyme, which in turn outperformed the C48G and C48A enzymes (Table I). This rank order differs from that of repeat and nucleotide addition processivities, in which the WT and C48G enzymes outperformed the C48A and C48U enzymes. Unlike the differences in processivity, the differences in overall activity cannot be explained by predicted alterations in the stability of the product-template hybrid. To investigate which features of the dGTP nucleotide were important for its ability to stimulate repeat addition processivity, we tested whether other purine nucleotides could enhance repeat addition processivity in reactions with 0.6 μmdGTP. Addition of the ribonucleotide triphosphate GTP or deoxyinosine triphosphate (dITP) at concentrations up to 125 μm failed to enhance repeat addition processivity (Fig.3 A). GTP differs from dGTP by the presence of a ribose C-2′-hydroxyl group, whereas dITP differs from dGTP by the lack of the amino group on base C-2. Thus, addition of a C-2′ hydroxyl or loss of the C-2 amino group both prevent dGTP from stimulating repeat addition processivity. GTP is incorporated poorly byTetrahymena telomerase (18Collins K. Greider C.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5422-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and neither GTP nor dITP inhibited incorporation of [32P]dGTP under the conditions assayed (Fig. 3 A). We also examined 7-deaza-dGTP, which differs from dGTP by carbon substitution of the base N-7. Addition of 7-deaza-dGTP to reactions with 0.6 μm dGTP had three consequences: stimulation of repeat addition processivity, inhibition of [32P]dGTP incorporation, and alteration of the product profile to promote accumulation of products with lengths of primer +3, +9, etc. (Fig.3 A). Each of these effects of 7-deaza-dGTP was competed by addition of extra dGTP, with the ratio of products altered as a reflection of the ratio of dGTP to 7-deaza-dGTP in the reaction (Fig.3 A, right). The altered product profile was also observed in assays with [32P]dTTP and 7-deaza-dGTP alone, without any dGTP (data not shown). In reactions with 0.6 μm [32P]dGTP without dTTP, 7-deaza-dGTP and dGTP both stimulated synthesis of a polynucleotide ladder (Fig.3 B). These results suggest that 7-deaza-dGTP is efficiently incorporated by telomerase into both telomeric repeats and a polynucleotide ladder, but that 7-deaza-dGTP incorporation into telomeric repeats affects the product profile. The change in product pattern is likely to reflect a change in the stability of the product-template hybrid. Independent of its possible impact on hybrid stability, however, the repeat addition processivity stimulated by 7-deaza-dGTP indicates that the dGTP nitrogen at base position 7 is not an essential property of a processivity-stimulatory nucleotide. We next examined the role of the dGTP triphosphate group. Surprisingly, addition of 2.6, 10, or 40 μm of dGMP, dGDP, or dGTP to assays with 0.6 μm [32P]dGTP stimulated repeat addition processivity (Fig.4 A). The maximal repeat addition processivity obtained with titration of the concentration of each of these three nucleotides was strikingly similar, as was the concentration of nucleotide required to obtain it. In contrast, addition of up to 250 μm deoxyguanosine did not stimulate repeat addition processivity (Fig. 4 B). Although dGMP and dGDP cannot be incorporated, they inhibited product synthesis (Fig. 4,A and B). This inhibition was eliminated by addition of extra dGTP (data not shown). In contrast, deoxyguanosine did not inhibit product synthesis (Fig. 4 B). We conclude that the nucleotide-stimulating repeat addition processivity requires only a monophosphate group. In addition, we note that all nucleotides that stimulate repeat addition processivity reduce dGTP incorporation, whether or not they can be incorporated themselves. This suggests that the processivity-stimulatory dGTP (or dGTP analog) is binding in the active site with a specificity that parallels that of dGTP binding for nucleotide incorporation (see “Discussion”). In addition to template position 48 and a substrate dNTP, the active site elongating a repositioned product would be strongly influenced by the terminal product-template base pair. To investigate the role of this base pair, composed of a product G and template C in the wild-type enzyme, we created expression constructs encoding C4349U and C4349G telomerase RNAs. It was necessary to coordinately change both positions C-43 and C-49 to obtain processive repeat addition, because a product 3′-end synthesized at the template 5′-end must be able to rebind at the template 3′-end (Fig. 5 A). Telomerases with wild-type, C4349U, or C4349G templates were assayed with the primers (TG)8TTG, (TG)8TTA, or (TG)8TTC, respectively. The C4349U enzyme assayed with (TG)8TTA synthesize"

Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar and 38Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Paxillin is tyrosine phosphorylated upon integrin activation (39Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), and thus creates binding sites for several Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins such as Crk-I, Crk-II, Crk-L, and Csk (reviewed in Ref. 38Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin has been shown to be important for cell spreading on the extracellular matrix (40Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), cell cycle progression (39Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), as well as adhesion-dependent function of leukocytes (41Graham I.L. Anderson D.C. Holers V.M. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Paxillin is composed of multiple isoforms, α, β, and γ (42Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These isoforms exhibit different biochemical properties in their binding to other proteins such as vinculin and Fak. For example, both the α and β isoforms bind to Fak whereas the γ isoform does not (42Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PAK1 is well co-localized with paxillin at Cdc42- and Rac1-driven small substrate adhesions at the cell periphery, called focal complexes (23Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar); or co-localized with integrin at focal adhesions (43Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Turner et al. (44Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) have shown the association of PAK3 with paxillin. They reported that this association is not mediated by the direct interaction of these two proteins, but mediated through the aid of two other proteins. They showed that paxillin directly binds to p95PKL, which also binds to βPIX; and proposed a model in which paxillin associates with PAK3 through three steps: paxillin binds to p95PKL, p95PKL then binds to βPIX, and βPIX finally binds to PAK3 (44Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To analyze the mechanism involved in the recruitment and activation of the PAK kinases in integrin signaling, we here examined the binding of PAKs to focal adhesion proteins. Consistent with a previous report by Turner et al. (44Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), we found that paxillin associated with PAK3. On the other hand, other focal adhesion proteins, including Fak, Pyk2, vinculin, talin, tensin, and p130Cas, did not exhibit a significant association with PAK3. Among paxillin isoforms, the α and β isoforms significantly associated with PAK3, whereas the association with PAK3 was only marginally detectable with the γ isoform. In contrast to the model previously proposed (44Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), however, we found that paxillin α could bind directly to PAK3. We also showed that paxillin α could be phosphorylated by the Cdc42-activated PAK3. Our results collectively indicates that paxillin α fulfills several biochemical properties required to serve to link PAK3 to integrin signaling, which have been ascribed to Nck in linking PAK1 to growth factor receptor signaling (30Galisteo M.L.

Moreover, we found that paxillin α associates with both the kinase-inactive and the Cdc42-activated forms of PAK3 in vivo; and that the paxillin α binding to PAK3 could be competitive with the βPIX binding to PAK3 in vivo and in vitro. It has been shown that βPIX binding to PAK3 activates the kinase activity of PAK3 (23Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar); thus, according to the previous model for the association of PAK3 with paxillin (44Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), only the βPIX-bound and thereby activated form of PAK3 seems to be associated with paxillin. Therefore, our results indicate that the association of paxillin with PAK3 through the aid of p95PKL and βPIX (44Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) may not be the sole way of the interaction of paxillin with PAK3. On the other hand, our model of the direct binding of PAK3 to paxillin α even in the absence of βPIX is consistent with the recent finding that the kinase-inactive and/or nonautophosphorylated form of PAK1 is preferentially localized to focal adhesions (45Zhao A-S. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 3Y1 and COS7 cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 4.5 g of glucose/liter) supplemented with 5 and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories), respectively. For preparation of cell extracts from neonatal rat brain (NRB), neonatal Wistar strain rats (postnatal days 1–3) purchased from Nippon Doubutsu (Osaka, Japan) were killed by decapitation, and whole brains were removed quickly and frozen at −70 °C until use. Tissue lysates were then prepared by homogenization of NRB in 5 volumes of an ice-cold 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1% aprotinin and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a Dounce-type glass homogenizer, followed by clarification by 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Rat PAK1 cDNA was a gift from K. Mizuno (Tohoku University), and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-ATGGATCCTCAAATAACGGCTTAGACGTCCAGGAC-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTAGTGATTGTTCTTGGTTGCCTCTTTTGC-3′. The resultingBamHI-NotI fragment was subcloned into pEBG (46Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) vector to be fused in-frame to the COOH terminus of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) protein. Mouse PAK3 cDNA was isolated from first strand cDNAs, prepared from adult male BALB/c mouse brain (CLONTECH), by the PCR amplification method using oligonucleotides 5′-ATGGATCCATGTCTGACAGCTTGGATAACGAAGAAA-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCTTAACGGCTACTGTTCTTAATTGCTTCCTTTG-3′. The resultingBamHI-NotI PAK3 cDNA fragment was subcloned into each of pEBG to be fused in-frame to the COOH terminus of GST protein, or pEFBOS-HA (47Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) to be tagged with the HA-tag at its NH2 terminus. Deletion mutants for PAK3 were then constructed using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-ATGGATCCATGTCTGACAGCTTGGATAACGAAGAAA-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTATTTCTTCTTTGGGTCCCCAACACTCAC-3′ for the M1 mutant encompassing amino acids (1–267 aa), 5′-ATGGATCCAAAGAGAAAGAGCGCCCAGAGATCTCTCTTCC-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTAGGCACTTTTATCTCCTGACGTAAAGCTC-3′ for M2 (63–147 aa), 5′-ATGGATCCGACAATGAACCTCCGCCTGTCATTGC-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTAGGAGCGAGTATAGATTGATTTTG-3′ for M3 (184–205 aa), 5′-ATGGATCCTATACGAGATTGGAAAAAATTGGCCAAGGG-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCTTAACGGCTACTGTTCTTAATTGCTTCCTTTG-3′ for M4 (268–544 aa), 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTAGGAGCGAGTATAGATTGATTTTG-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTATTTCTTCTTTGGGTCCCCAACACTCAC-3′ for M5 (184–267 aa), 5′-ATGGATCCATGTCTGACAGCTTGGATAACGAAGAAA-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTACTTCTTATTGGTTTTATCCCCTCCTCCTGG-3′ for M6 (1–62 aa), and 5′-ATGGATCCCATGGATACATAGCAGCACATCAGTCG-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTATTTCTTCTTTGGGTCCCCAACACTCAC-3′ for M7 (148–267 aa). The resulting BamHI-NotI PCR fragment for the M1 mutant was ligated into pEBG, and otherBamHI-NotI PCR fragments for the M2-M7 mutants were each ligated into pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) vector, to be fused in-frame to the COOH terminus of GST protein. The autoinhibitory domain of PAK3 (78–146 aa), corresponding to the similar region of PAK1 (83–149 aa) that has been shown to act as inhibitor for PAK1 in vivo (16Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 48Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was synthesized using oligonucleotides 5′-ATGGATCCCATACGATTCATGTGGGTTTTGATGCAGTC-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTAACTTTTATCTCCTGACGTAAAGCTC-3′, and the resulting PCR BamHI-NotI fragment was ligated into pEBG vector to be fused in-frame to the COOH terminus of GST protein. Human βPIX cDNA (KIAA0142) was a gift from T. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute), and amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-ATGGATCCATGACCGACAATAGCAACAATCAACTGGTAG-3′ and 5′-ATGGATCCCGTCCCTTATAGATTGGTCTC-3′. ResultingBamHI-BamHI fragment was ligated into pQE-30 (Qiagen) and pcDNA3.1 His-C (Invitrogen) vectors, to be tagged with six consecutive histidines (His-tag) at its NH2terminus. DNA fragment encoding the 1–7-amino acid portion of paxillin fused in-frame to the COOH terminus of His-tag was made by hybridizing oligonucleotides of 5′-GATCTCCGGCCATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGACGACCTCGACGCCCTGC-3′ and 5′-GGGCGTCGAGGTCGTCGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCATGGCCGGA-3′, and the resulting fragment was ligated into theBglII-BglI site of pVL1392/paxillin α and pVL1392/paxillin γ plasmids (49Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), to make paxillin α and paxillin γ proteins each tagged with the His-tag at their NH2termini, respectively. PCR-amplified DNA fragments which each corresponds to the LD1 (1–20 aa), LD2 (141–160 aa), LD3 (212–231 aa), LD4 (263–282 aa), and LD5 (299–317 aa) motifs of human paxillin α were subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX-2TK vector, each to be fused in-frame to the COOH terminus of the GST protein, as previously reported (44Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The LD4 motif-deletion mutant of paxillin α was synthesized using oligonucleotides 5′-ATGGATCCATGGACGACCTCGACGCCCTGCTGGCGGAC-3′, and 5′-ATGCCGGCAGAGGAGGCCGAGATGCGTGTCTGCTG-3′; and 5′-ATGCCGGCAAGACAGGGAGCAGCTCACCCCCTGGG-3′, and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTAGCAGAAGAGCTTGAGGAAGCAGTTCTG-3′. ResultingBamHI-NaeI and NaeI-NotI PCR fragments were simultaneously ligated into pEBG vector to be fused in-frame to the COOH terminus of the GST protein. pAcG2T (Pharmingen) plasmid containing human paxillin isoform cDNAs to be fused in-frame to the COOH terminus of GST were described previously (49Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mouse Nck cDNA was a gift from H. Hanafusa (Osaka Bioscience Institute), and amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-ATGGATCCATGGCTGAAGGAGTGGTGGTGGTGGCC-3′ and 5′-ATGGATCCTCAAGACAAATGCTTGACGAG-3′. The resultingBamHI-BamHI fragment was ligated into pGEX2TK vector, to be fused in-frame to the COOH terminus of GST protein. Nucleotide sequences were confirmed with all these plasmids after the construction. pEFBOS-HA-Cdc42 G12V was a gift from S. Kuroda and K. Kaibuchi (Nara Institute of Science and Technology). Proteins encoded by pGEX vectors were expressed in Escherichia coli by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and proteins encoded by the pEBG vector were expressed in COS7 cells, as described previously (49Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These GST-tagged proteins were then subjected to purification using glutathione-Sepharose beads, as previously described (50Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Proteins encoded by the pQE-30 vector were expressed in E. coli by induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. These His-tagged proteins were then subjected to purification using nickel beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen) and further fractionated on Mono Q column using Biologic System (Bio-Rad), if necessary. Nck was purified as followed; GST-Nck was cleaved by thrombin protease at room temperature for 2 h and then purified by Mono Q column chromatography using the Biologic System. Proteins encoded by the pAcG2T and pVL1392 vectors were expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen). COS7 cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs using DEAE-dextran method, and cell extracts were prepared with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 3 μg/ml pepstatin A), as previously described (50Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Anti-βPIX antibody was prepared by immunizing rabbit with the GST fusion form of the NH2-terminal half of human βPIX/p85Cool-1, which corresponds to the entire region of p50Cool-1. Anti-paxillin antibody was previously described (42Mazaki Y. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the following proteins were purchased from commercial sources: PAK1 and PAK3 from StressGen; talin and vinculin from Sigma; Nck, Fak, and Pyk2 from Transduction Labs; tensin from Chemicon; p130Cas from Upstate Biotechnology; and HA-tag sequence and GST-tag sequence from BAbCO. For in vitro protein binding analysis, cell lysates prepared by 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer, or purified protein preparations which were dialyzed against 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer, were mixed with GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed four times with 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer. For in vivo protein binding analysis, 300 μg of COS7 cell lysates prepared by 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer were mixed with 5 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer. For immunoblotting, protein samples retained on glutathione beads were boiled in Laemmli's SDS sample buffer, separated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane filters (Immobilon P, Millipore), and subjected to immunoblotting analysis as previously described (50Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Antibodies retained on the filter membranes were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) coupled with an enzyme-linked chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein precipitants with glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed four times in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer and then twice in a kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were then resuspended in 20 μl of the kinase buffer containing 2 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma), and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reactions were terminated by boiling in Laemmli's SDS sample buffer, and samples were visualized by separating on 12% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To prepare paxillin α protein which was not contaminated with serine/threonine kinase activities, His-paxillin α bound to nickel beads was incubated in a denaturing buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m Na phosphate (pH 8.0)) at room temperature for 1 h, which was then followed by sequential incubation with a renaturing buffer A (3 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 mNa phosphate"

The process of continuous mutation of DNA enables adaptation to changing environments, and it is a prerequisite for evolution. It was generally accepted that this mutation and subsequent arising of variant organisms is a spontaneous process that generates a pool of genetically different individuals in a population under nonselective conditions, from which under selective conditions the individual(s) with beneficial mutation(s) will originate. In 1943 Luria and Delbrück (1Luria S.E. Delbrück M. Genetics. 1943; 28: 491-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were the first to experimentally study the origin of phage-resistant Escherichia coli mutants that arose from a sensitive population if plated in the presence of phage. They concluded, in favor of the spontaneous or growth-dependent mutation hypothesis, that the mutation to phage resistance was already generated in the population prior to exposure to the phage. Work by Cairns et al. (2Cairns J. Overbaugh J. Miller S. Nature. 1988; 335: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) did not support this conclusion, providing evidence that mutation could also originate from a more “directed” process, which occurred after cells were put on selective plates. This type of mutation was named adaptive (3Foster P.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 467-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or stationary phase mutation (4Rosenberg S.M. Thulin C. Harris R.S. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1559-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is observed in non- or slow growing populations of bacteria and yeasts (5Hall B.G. Genetica. 1998; 102/103: 109-125Crossref Google Scholar) subjected to nonlethal stress. Adaptive mutation is generally screened for by reversion of specific mutations in genes that bring about an auxotrophy. It was shown that adaptive mutation is a stress-inducible mechanism that involves transient genome-wide hypermutation of a subpopulation of cells, so-called mutators (6Hall B.G.

Most investigations that study spontaneous and adaptive mutations employ reversion systems and thus exclude a possible role of insertion sequence elements. However, these elements could provide an important mechanism for swift genetic adaptation, because they move through the genome (in-) activating genes and introducing genomic rearrangements (12Gala D.J.

In competition experiments using an E. coli strain with and without transposon Tn10, it was found that the Tn10strains win, if present at a starting ratio above 10−4. Additionally, it was found that the winning Tn10 strains had a transposition to a new, undetermined site. It was concluded that Tn10 conferred advantage by increasing the mutation rate of the host bacterium. More recently it was shown that insertion sequence elements play an important role in genetic adaptation of E. coli under starving conditions (16Hall B.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we address the role of a newly discovered insertion sequence in genetic adaptation to sudden lethal solvent stress. It resides naturally in the genome of the solvent-tolerant bacteriumPseudomonas putida S12. Solvent-tolerant bacteria are quite extraordinary organisms able to grow in the presence of a separate phase of solvents like toluene. In normal bacteria these solvents accumulate within a few minutes (17Isken S. De Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6056-6058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the membranes of cells to concentrations that destabilize the lipid order and bilayer stability (18Weber F.J. De Bont J.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 225-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), thus destroying structural and functional properties. In solvent-tolerant bacteria two major adaptational responses have been found that counterbalance these effects. The first mechanisms deal with structural changes of the (outer) membranes (19Heipieper H.-J. Weber F.J. Sikkema J. Keweloh H. De Bont J.A.M.

The second mechanism is an extrusion system that transports solvents from the inner membrane out of the cell (17Isken S. De Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6056-6058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kieboom J. Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. De Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6769-6772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kieboom J.

InP. putida S12, the srpABC genes encode such a solvent efflux pump responsible for the extrusion of uncharged lipophilic compounds like toluene (25Kieboom J. Dennis J.J. De Bont J.A.M. Zylstra G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Both adaptational responses occur after exposure to nonlethal inducing amounts of toluene (pre-adaptation). In this way, all cells in the population are prepared to survive even a separate phase of the solvent (1% v/v). This solvent-tolerant phenotype is rapidly lost when incubated in the absence of toluene. If toluene (1% v/v) is added shock-wise to cells that are not pre-adapted, then lysis of cells occurs. Surprisingly, a few cells in the population were consistently found to survive such a shock (26Kim K. Lee L. Lee K. Lim D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3692-3696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cruden D.L. Wolfram J.H. Rogers R.D. Gibson D.T. Appl. Environ.

These surviving individuals eventually grew to a high density in the presence of a separate phase of the solvent. Contrary to pre-adapted cells, such a population maintained its toluene-tolerant phenotype after prolonged incubation without toluene (32Weber F.J. Ooijkaas L.P. Schemen R.M.W. Hartmans S. De Bont J.A.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3502-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a transition into a solvent-tolerant genetic variant. In this study we show that the insertion sequence ISS12 is responsible for the emergence of this genetic variant. The dynamics of transposition and the underlying mechanism of solvent tolerance is uncovered, and the possible strategy of P. putida S12 to employ ISS12 as a mutator element to maintain a subpopulation of genetic variants preconditioned for extremely adverse conditions is discussed. P. putida S12 (34Hartmans S. Van der Werf M.J. De Bont J.A.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is the wild-type strain and P. putidaS12PT is a variant of P. putida S12, growing after sudden addition of 1% (v/v) toluene that carries one extra copy of insertion sequence ISS12 in srpS. P. putida JK1 is derived from P. putida S12 by transposon mutagenesis and carries a kanamycin resistance cassette in its genomic DNA in a stable fashion (25Kieboom J. Dennis J.J. De Bont J.A.M. Zylstra G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). P. putida S12 (pKRZ-srp) and P. putida S12PT (pKRZ-srp) are the respective transformants ofP. putida S12 and P. putida S12PT that carry the pKRZ-srp promoter-probe plasmid. This plasmid contains the promoterlesslacZ gene downstream of the srp promoter (24Kieboom J. Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. De Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6769-6772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).P. putida JK1CAM is a chloramphenicol-resistant mutant ofP. putida S12 from which insertion sequence ISS12was first isolated by PCR1amplification. E. coli strain DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 (φ80 lacZΔM15)hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96thi-1 relA1) was used for amplification of recombinant plasmids according to standard methods (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). LB broth (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used as complete medium. Solid media contained 2% of agar. Ampicillin (50 μg/ml) was added to maintain all plasmids inE. coli. Kanamycin (50 μg/ml) was added to maintain plasmid pKRZ-srp in P. putida strains, and gentamicin (10 μg/ml) was added to maintain plasmids pJWB1, pJWsrpS, and pJWsrpRS in P. putida strains. E. coliand P. putida strains were grown at 37 °C and 30 °C, respectively. Incubations in the presence of toluene were carried out in airtight Boston bottles equipped with Mininert valves (Phase Separations) in a horizontally shaking water bath at 30 °C. The survival frequency in the presence of toluene was determined by measuring the amount of colony-forming units (cfu), before and after incubating cells, that were in the early exponential growth phase (an optical density of 0.5 cm−1 at 600 nm), for 0.5 h in the presence of a separate phase of toluene (1% v/v). The cell viability was determined by plating 0.1-ml suitable dilutions in 0.9% (w/v) saline on LB agar plates. The agar plates were incubated for 20 h. For induction experiments 3 mm toluene was added to cultures in the early exponential phase (an optical density of 0.3 cm−1 at 600 nm). Cells were allowed to grow to an optical density of 1.5 cm−1 at 600 nm. Subsequently, β-galactosidase activity was determined by the method of Miller (36Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), using chloroform and sodium dodecyl sulfate to permeabilize the cells. Total genomic DNA from P. putida strains was prepared by the hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) procedure (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1991Google Scholar). Insert sequences were isolated from 0.7% agarose gels using the QIAEXII gel extraction kit (Qiagen). DNA digestions and ligations were carried out using enzymes purchased from Life Technologies and applied according to the supplier's recommendations. Plasmid DNA was isolated by the alkaline-sodium dodecyl sulfate lysis method of Birnboim and Doly (38Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9901) Google Scholar). For DNA hybridizations, total DNA of different P. putida strains was digested, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon filters according to standard protocols (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridizations were done using the nonradioactive DIG DNA labeling and detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PCR reaction for amplifying the DNA region in P. putida JK1CAM containing insertion sequence ISS12 was performed using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with high fidelity DNA synthesis. The DNA amplification reaction was set up according to the manufacturer's protocol, using primers 1 and 2 (see “PCR primers”). Sequencing of purified double-stranded plasmid DNA was accomplished using AmpliTaq FS DNA fluorescent dye terminator reactions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a Gene Amp PCR system 9600 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Sequencing products were detected using an Applied Biosystems 373A stretch-automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Nucleotide and protein sequence analysis was carried out with the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST server (39Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70715) Google Scholar). Plasmids pGEM-7Zf(+) and pGEM-T Easy (Promega) were used as the cloning vector for genomic DNA and PCR-amplified DNA, respectively. Plasmid pJWB1 is an E. coli-Pseudomonas shuttle vector obtained after replacement of the lacZα portion of pUCP22 (40West S.E.H. Schweizer H.P. Dall C. Sample A.K. Runyen-Janecky L.J. Gene. 1994; 128: 81-86Crossref Scopus (496) Google Scholar) by the multiple cloning site from pGEM7-Zf(+) (Promega) flanked by a restriction site of SfiI and NotI. PJWB1 was used for cloning srpS and srpRS as follows: DNA fragments containing the srpS and srpRS genes, including the 5′-noncoding region, were obtained after PCR amplification of these regions from total P. putida S12 DNA using primers 3 and 4 (srpS) and 3 and 5 (srpRS). Both PCR-amplified fragments were flanked by a restriction site ofKpnI and NotI and were ligated in pJWB1 cut withKpnI and NotI to give rise to plasmids pJWsrpS and pJWsrpRS. Plasmid DNA was introduced in P. putida strains or E. coli DH5α by electroporation (41Dennis J.J. Sokol P.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 47: 125-133PubMed Google Scholar) using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories). PCR primers (from 5′ to 3′), with relevant restriction sitesunderlined are: 1, CCCGGGTCAAGGAGGTGACTCATG; 2, CGCGGCCGCGATAATTCGCCACTTCAGTTCG; 3, GCGGGTACCGACGGGGGCTATTGCTGAATCG; 4, GCGGCGGCCGCCTAGGGAGCTTTCTTCGACGC; and 5, GCGGCGGCCGCTCACTCGAAGGATTTGACTTGC. ISS12 was isolated from a chloramphenicol-resistant P. putida S12 mutant, JK1CAM, that was shown to carry a 2.5-kb interruption of the gene coding for the solvent-pump porin,srpC. 2J. Wery, unpublished data. A 4-kb DNA fragment containing the srpC gene with the interrupting DNA was generated by PCR amplification with primers designed on both ends of srpC. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the interrupting DNA revealed a 2598-bp sequence with typical characteristics of an insertion sequence (IS) element (Fig. 1). This sequence has been submitted to the GenBank™/EBI database (accession numberAF292393). The element was delimited by two perfect matching inverted repeats of 14 bp (IR-L1/IR-R1) and 18 bp (IR-L2/IR-R2). Furthermore, two open reading frames were found, orf1 andorf2, that putatively encode proteins of 509 amino acids (58,175 Da) and 251 amino acids (28,528 Da), respectively. These amino acid sequences have extensive homology with those deduced fromorf1 and orf2 of IS1491, isolated from Pseudomonas alcaligenes NCIB 9867 (TableI) (42Yeo C.C. Wong D.T.S. Poh C.L. Plasmid. 1998; 89: 187-195Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Less, but significant homology is observed with other IS elements that, like IS1491, belong to the IS21 family of insertion sequences. In addition, structural characteristics of ISS12 also reveal relationship with IS21 (Fig. 1) (14Mahillon J. Chandler M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 725-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Haas D. Berger B. Schmid S. Seitz T. Reihmann C. Nakazawa T. Molecular Biology of Pseudomonads. ASM Press, Washington, DC1996: 238-249Google Scholar). The reading frame oforf2 is located in a relative reading phase of −1 compared with orf1, and both orfs are separated by only 17 bp. Furthermore, orf1 reveals two motifs typical of insertion sequences. The N terminus contains 25 amino acids that have high probability of forming a helix-turn-helix configuration capable of DNA binding and a so-called DDE triad. DDE motifs are found in the catalytic domains of transposases of many bacterial elements and integrases of retroviruses (45Solinas F. Marconi A.M. Ruzzi M. Zennaro E. Gene. 1995; 155: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The putative protein encoded byorf2 contains well conserved potential nucleoside triphosphate binding domains A and B (45Solinas F. Marconi A.M. Ruzzi M. Zennaro E.

For this purpose, chromosomal DNA was isolated from an aliquot of P. putida S12 cells cultured in LB to an optical density at 600 nm (A 600) of 0.5. Subsequently, 1% (v/v) toluene was added to the remainder of the culture, killing approximately 99.99% of the cells within 30 min. After 24–48 h, a culture had grown up and total DNA was isolated from this population, designated as P. putida S12PT (post-toluene). Both DNAs were digested with KpnI, which does not cut in the DNA of ISS12. After separation by agarose gel electrophoresis, the DNAs were transferred to nylon filters and hybridized with an internal 650-bp DNA probe from ISS12(Fig. 2). Lane 1 shows the hybridization pattern of DNA from P. putida S12 cells before the toluene shock. Here seven distinct hybridizing DNA fragment ranging from 3.5 to 10 kb are visible, indicating that at least seven copies of ISS12 are dispersed over the genome of P. putidaS12. In lane 2 the result with P. putida S12PT DNA is shown. Here an extra hybridizing DNA fragment of approximately 9 kb is visible, indicating transposition of ISS12. This result strongly suggested that individuals of a P. putida S12 population that carry an extra copy of ISS12in a particular location in the genome are more tolerant of a toluene shock. To investigate this, exponentially growing unadapted P. putida S12 cells were exposed for 30 min to 1% toluene and subsequently an aliquot was spread on LB agar. Only 0.004% of the plated cells had survived to form colonies. DNA was isolated from 15 individual colonies and analyzed for the distribution of ISS12 as described for P. putida S12 and S12PT. The hybridization pattern of 1 DNA resembled that of the wild-typeP. putida S12, whereas the pattern of 14 DNAs was identical to P. putida S12PT DNA (data not shown). We further tested the correlation between transposition and solvent tolerance by comparing the survival frequency of both P. putida S12 and S12PT after sudden addition of 1% (v/v) toluene. It was found that approximately 0.004% of the P. putida S12 and 5% of the P. putida S12PT cells survived the shock, a 1000-fold increase of survival frequency. The stability of both genotype and phenotype of aP. putida S12PT population was tested during prolonged cultivation in LB medium in two different ways. In the first approach the growth experiment was started with an inoculum from P. putida S12PT that had emerged from wild-type P. putidaS12 after a toluene shock. This P. putida S12PT population was possibly not genetically homogeneous, because there was a chance that wild-type cells were also present. DNA was isolated from the culture after 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, and 104 generations of growth after inoculation. Southern hybridization on these DNAs was performed with an ISS12-derived probe after digestion withKpnI (Fig. 3 A). After 91 generations the extra ISS12 insertion could no longer be detected and the hybridization pattern resembled that of wild-type P. putida S12. In addition, the tolerance for a toluene shock decreased to wild-type levels after 104 generations (data not shown). In the second approach we started the growth experiment with a pureP. putida S12PT clone (genetically homogeneous) and monitored the presence of the extra ISS12 copy during ∼104 generations of cultivation (Fig. 3 B). Now we found that the extra copy remained present in the population and the tolerance for a toluene shock remained high (data not shown). This result indicated that the extra ISS12 insertion is not readily lost from the genome, suggesting that the disappearance of the P. putidaS12PT genotype in the first approach was due to out-competition by wild-type P. putida S12 cells that most probably were initially present as a minority in the starting culture. It was further investigated if wild-type P. putida S12 has a selective advantage over P. putida S12PT in competition experiments. To facilitate discrimination between the different strainsP. putida S12 containing a kanamycin marker, P. putida JK1 (25Kieboom J. Dennis J.J. De Bont J.A.M. Zylstra G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), was employed as the reference. Exponentially growing cells of both P. putida JK1 and P. putidaS12PT were mixed and allowed to grow for 100 generations. Both the starting and end ratios of the two different strains were determined by plating suitable dilutions of the mixtures on LB agar with and without kanamycin and comparing the cfu counts on both plates. P. putida JK1 and P. putida S12PT were mixed to a starting ratio of 1 (P. putida JK1:P. putida S12PT, 1:1). In this mixture P. putida JK1 had overgrown P. putida S12PT, because no significant differences were found in cfu counts between both types of plates. To obtain a more accurate measure of the competition advantage of P. putida JK1, a starting ratio of 0.001 (P. putida JK1:P. putida S12PT, 1:1000) was chosen. Here it was found that the share of P. putida JK1 in the cell mixture had increased 50-fold. In a control experiment a mixture of P. putida S12 and P. putida JK1 was also tested. Here both strains were mixed to a starting ratio of 1. The end ratio showed that the share of P. putida JK1 had declined by a factor 7, indicating a competitive advantage of the wild-type P. putida S12 over the reference strain. These results clearly indicate that P. putida S12 has a competitive advantage over P. putida S12PT under these nonselective conditions. The exact location of integration of the extra ISS12 copy in P. putida S12PT was determined (Fig. 4). For this purpose this copy was isolated from BglII-digested total DNA fromP. putida S12PT on a 9-kb DNA fragment and cloned. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA-region flanking ISS12 was determined using primers specific for either end of ISS12. Screening for similar nucleotide sequences in the GenBank™/EBI database revealed a 100% match with the gene srpS(GenBank™/EBI accession number AF061937), which is located 223 bp upstream of the genes for the solvent resistance pumpsrpABC. srpS forms a gene cluster,srpRS, with the downstream-located srpR (Fig. 4). Sequence similarity studies revealed that both genes putatively encode regulatory proteins involved in control of srpABC expression (not shown). Two nucleotides adjacent to the left inverted repeat IR-L and six nucleotides adjacent to IR-R could not be assigned to either ISS12 or srpS. To verify that the extra insertion of ISS12 in the 14 toluene shock-surviving individuals was also confined to this gene. Southern analysis was performed on their DNAs. The DNAs were digested with PstI and SacI, which cut at either end of the srpS gene (Fig. 4) and do not cut ISS12. Hybridization with an internal DNA probe from ISS12 yielded a 3.4-kb hybridizing band, which was absent in wild-type P. putida S12 (result not shown), reflecting integration of the insertion element (2.6 kb) in srpS (0.8 kb). We anticipated that the direct cause for increased solvent tolerance in P. putida S12PT was the disruption of the putative pump regulator srpS. To support this hypothesis, we introduced promoter probe vector pKRZ-srp (24Kieboom J. Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. De Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6769-6772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into P. putida S12 and S12PT. In this plasmid, the promoter region ofsrpABC is fused to the promoterless lacZ gene. Both strains were cultivated either in the presence or absence of 3 mm toluene to the late exponential phase. We chose to use 3 mm toluene, because it was shown previously that this amount induced the expression of the lacZ gene in pKRZ-srp significantly, without affecting the growth ofP. putida S12 (24Kieboom J. Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. De Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6769-6772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that β-galactosidase activity in P. putida S12PT transformant was approximately 7-fold higher than in the P. putida S12 transformant in the absence of toluene. If grown in the presence of toluene, β-galactosidase activity had increased 10-fold in the P. putida S12 transformant and 1.5-fold in P. putida S12PT transformant reaching comparable levels in both strains (TableII). These results show that the basal level of srp promoter activity is markedly higher inP. putida S12PT and can only be matched in the wild-type strain after toluene induction. This finding suggests that the tolerance of P. putida S12 PT for a sudden toluene shock is based on constitutive, relatively high expression of the solvent pump and that, the other way around, the sensitivity of the wild-type strain is due to a lack of pump in the membrane at the instant of exposure. To test this hypothesis, the survival frequency of toluene-inducedP. putida S12 was determined. Cells were grown to anA 600 of 0.5 in the presence of 3 mmtoluene and subsequently diluted 1 to 5 into medium with 5 mm toluene. At an A 600 of 0.5, 1% (v/v) toluene was added and dilutions of the culture were spread on LB agar. Approximately 5% of the cells survived to form colonies, which is comparable to the survival frequency observed with “uninduced”P. putida S12PT. The DNAs of 15 surviving colonies were analyzed for distribution of ISS12. It was found that none contained an extra insertion (data not shown) and that toluene tolerance was lost within 10 generations of nonselective growth.Table IIInduction of μ-galactosidase expression in P. putida S12 (pKRZ-srp) and P. putida S12PT (pKRZ-srp) cultured in the presence or absence of tolueneP. putida strainβ-Galactosidase activity aP. putida strains transformed with promoter-probe plasmid pKRZ-srp (in parentheses) were grown to the midexponential phase (an optical density of 0.3 at 600 nm) in LB broth.

Standard deviations are within parentheses. Open table in a new tab The increased level of solvent pump-promoter activity in P. putida S12PT suggested that the most plausible explanation for toluene tolerance of this strain is the interruption of srpS. This would imply that complementation with the intact regulatory region would result in an increased sensitivity. To prove this, P. putida S12PT was transformed with plasmids pJWsrpS and pJWsrpRS, containing srpS and srpRS, respectively. The latter plasmid was also tested, because transcription ofsrpR is also likely to be impeded by the ISS12insertion as srpS and R share a mutual upstream nontranslated region. The tolerance of transformants for a sudden shock of toluene was compared with P. putida S12PT transformed with empty plasmid pJWB1 (Table III). It was shown that sensitivity was dramatically increased in P. putida S12PT only if complemented with both srpR andS.Table IIISurvival of different P. putida strains after sudden addition of 1% (v/v) tolueneP. putidastrainaIn parentheses are the names of the introduced plasmids.Survival frequency%S120.004S12PT5S12PT(pJWB1)5S12PT(pJWsrpS)5S12PT(pJWsrpRS)0.00053-a In parentheses are the names of the introduced plasmids. Open table in a new tab Insertion sequences have been shown to be important for genomic plasticity of certain bacteria. Over 500 bacterial insertion sequences have been characterized at the nucleotide sequence level (14Mahillon J. Chandler M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 725-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in the literature many examples of insertion sequences can be found that are involved in activation of neighboring genes, inactivation of genes by interruption, and rearrangement of their hosts genome (12Gala D.J. Chandler M. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1989: 109-162Google Scholar, 13Kleckner N. Chalmers R.M. Kwon D. Sakai J. Bolland S. Saedler H. Gierl A. Transposable Elements. Springer-Verlag KG, Heidelberg, Germany1996: 49-82Google Scholar, 14Mahillon J. Chandler M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 725-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of these elements in genetic adaptation and the dynamics of transposition in changing environments have hardly been studied. We show here that P. putida S12 under sudden lethal conditions is able to produce a genetic variant, by means of ISS12, enabling the bacterium to survive. In the variantP. putida S12PT, the underlying mechanism of toluene shock survival appears to be the up-regulation of the srpABCgenes. This would imply that the region in which ISS12 is inserted is involved in repression of srpABC. It could still be argued that the structural change of the DNA upstream of thesrpABC genes resulting from the ISS12 insertion also influences the expression accounting for (part of) the toluene tolerance. However, complementation with intact srpRS genes showed a dramatic decrease of toluene tolerance, proving that structural factors did not play an important role. Because complementation with srpS alone did not result in a decreased tolerance, we propose that both srpR andS are needed for effective repression of thesrpABC genes. It goes without saying that more detailed experiments concerning these genes and possibly other are needed for a complete picture of the regulation of the solvent pump genes. We showed that in P. putida S12PT, activation of thesrp promoter is up-regulated in the absence of toxic solvents and we hypothesize for this reason that the high survival frequency of this variant is due to the fact that it is already prepared to deal with sudden solvent stress. Isken and De Bont (17Isken S. De Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6056-6058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) measured accumulation of 14C-labeled toluene in the membrane of P. putida S12. Using 4 mm of the solvent, which is below the saturating concentration (6 mm) but toxic to the cells, they found maximum accumulation in the membrane within 10 min of incubation. More recently, Kieboom et al. (24Kieboom J. Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. De Bont J.A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6769-6772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that maximum activation of the srp promoter inP. putida S12 by toluene occurred 200 min after addition of the solvent. After ∼60 min, activation reached 50% of the maximum. These findings indicate that a lack of time to engage the principal defense mechanism against sudden solvent stress is the main reason that over 99.99% of a P. putida S12 population is killed upon a toluene shock. The solvent shock tolerant nature of this species lies in the presence of the extra copy of ISS12 in thesrpS gene in a small minority of its population. It is highly unlikely that transposition of ISS12 occurs in response to the toluene shock. This is simply because the toluene will have had its killing effect before the SrpABC pump is in operation. Indeed, we found that pre-adaptation to nonlethal amounts of toluene led to a high survival frequency of P. putida S12 after subsequent addition of 1% of the solvent, without ISS12 transposition. From the above it follows that the variant, to survive, must be present before the toluene shock. Thus, under normal conditions P. putida S12 always maintains a subpopulation, accounting for at least 0.004% of the whole population, that carries ISS12 inserted insrpS. From our results it also becomes clear that mutation by ISS12 is a more important mechanism than other growth-dependent mutations, like point mutations, frameshifts, deletions, or others, that could lead to inactivation ofsrpS and subsequent toluene shock survival. This suggests that ISS12 is a mutator element that is employed by the bacterium to maintain subpopulations of preconditioned cells.

We demonstrated that PG levels in cells were partly controlled by a regulatory protein, phospholipase A2(PLA2)-activating protein (PLAA). Treatment of murine macrophages with lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α increased PLAA levels at early time points (2–30 min), which correlated with an up-regulation in cytosolic PLA2 and PGE2 levels. Both COX-2 and secretory PLA2 were also increased in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, however, at later time points of 4–24 h. The role of PLAA in eicosanoid formation in macrophages was confirmed by the use of an antisense plaa oligonucleotide. Within amino acid residues 503–538, PLAA exhibited homology with melittin, and increased PGE2 production was noted in macrophages stimulated with melittin. In addition to PLA2, we demonstrated that activation of phospholipase C and D significantly controlled PGE2 production. Finally, increased antigen levels of PLAA, COX-2, and phospholipases were demonstrated in biopsy specimens from patients with varying amounts of intestinal mucosal inflammation, which corresponded to increased levels of phospholipase activity.

Phospholipase and eicosanoid production are inextricably linked through a pathway originating from arachidonic acid (AA), a 20-carbon, unsaturated fatty acid that is hydrolyzed from membrane phospholipids by secretory PLA2(sPLA2) and cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) (8Yang V.W. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1996; 25: 317-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Among these PLA2s, a 14-kDa type IIa sPLA2, which hydrolyzes phospholipids from thesn-2 position, has been extensively studied. The sPLA2 requires millimolar amounts of calcium for activity and has been linked to many other inflammatory diseases, notably adult respiratory distress syndrome (5Kim D.K. Fukuda T. Thompson B.T. Cockrill B. Hales C. Bonventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L109-L118PubMed Google Scholar), rheumatoid arthritis (1Bomalaski J.S. Clark M.A. Adv. Exp. Med.

A third PLA2 is calcium-independent PLA2(iPLA2), and, although not as extensively characterized as the others, iPLA2 is thought to be responsible for the late phase production of prostaglandins (PGs) when intracellular calcium levels in cells have been depleted (12Lio Y.C.

There are two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, constitutive COX-1 and inducible COX-2. COX-2-induced PG production has been implicated in inflammation, as elevated levels of this protein have been found in synovial cells treated with inflammatory mediators or from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (33Arslan A.

PGE2 has been shown to increase cPLA2and COX-2 levels and thereby amplify its own production, as well as to increase synthesis of some inflammatory cytokines resulting in a perpetuation of the immune response (23Murakami M.

Two central targets have been COX-2 and PLA2 (43van Dullemen H.M. Wolbink G.J. Wever P.C. van der Poll T. Hack C.E. Tytgat G.N. van Deventer S.J. Scand. J.

Recently, a phospholipase A2-activating protein (PLAA) cDNA has been cloned from a human monocyte cell line (U937) by our research group (44Chopra A.K. Ribardo D.A. Wood T.G. Prusak D.J. Xu X.J. Peterson J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cDNA-encoding PLAA was originally cloned from murine BC3H1 cells using antibodies to melittin, a 26-amino acid (aa)-long peptide and a major component in bee venom (45Steiner M.R. Bomalaski J.S. Clark M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At the aa level, murine, rat, and human PLAA exhibit 93–97% homology (44Chopra A.K. Ribardo D.A. Wood T.G. Prusak D.J. Xu X.J. Peterson J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When murine PLAA was injected into the synovium of rabbits, an increased amount of inflammation occurred that correlated with an increase in sPLA2 activity (46Bomalaski J.S. Baker D. Resurreccion N.V. Clark M.A. Agents Actions. 1989; 27: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Likewise, sPLA2 and PLAA have been implicated in a number of other cell functions, including Golgi tubulation and retrograde trafficking, peroxisomal motility in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and calcium oscillations/amylase secretion in rat pancreatic acini (47Polizotto R.S. de Figueiredo P.

Haraldsen G. Rugtveit J. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1997; 18: 555-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); however, the etiology and the pathogenesis of these diseases are not yet fully understood (6van Dullemen H. Meenan J. Stronkhorst A. Tytgat G.N. van Deventer S.J. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 223 (suppl.): 92-98Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that there are two central components to IBD (8Yang V.W. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1996; 25: 317-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The first is the initiation of an aberrant immune response, which may result from absorption of foreign antigens of microbial origin, possibly from resident flora in the intestinal lumen. The second is the amplification and perpetuation of this aberrant immune response (7Zeitz M. Digestion. 1997; 58 Suppl. 1: 59-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Yang V.W. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1996; 25: 317-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which is responsible for tissue injury due to the involvement of cytokines, eicosanoids, reactive oxygen species, and complement (6van Dullemen H. Meenan J. Stronkhorst A. Tytgat G.N. van Deventer S.J. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 223 (suppl.): 92-98Google Scholar). Examination of biopsy specimens from patients with UC and CD has revealed a marked increase in all of these factors and of PLA2 and PGE2 (4Haapamaki M.M. Gronroos J.M. Nurmi H. Alanen K.

Gut. 1994; 35: 1593-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We initiated studies to assess the involvement of PLAA in PLA2-associated eicosanoid production leading to inflammation in patients with UC and CD. Our studies using immunohistochemistry detected PLAA in inflammatory cells from patients with UC and CD and in mice chemically treated with dextran sodium sulfate, which induced colitis (52Peterson J.W. Dickey W.D. Saini S.S. Gourley W. Klimpel G.R. Chopra A.K. Gut. 1996; 39: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The tissues from normal patients and untreated mice were devoid of any staining for PLAA.The objectives of this study were as follows: 1) to establish whether PLAA was induced in inflammatory cells (e.g. macrophages) by LPS, IL-1β, and TNFα; 2) whether an antisense oligonucleotide toplaa cDNA would inhibit AA release from stimulated cells, which could lead to the development of potentially important therapeutic PLAA peptides controlling inflammation; 3) whether other phospholipases (e.g. PLC and PLD) contribute to PGE2 production; and 4) whether levels of PLAA, phospholipases, and COX-2 could be correlated to the extent of inflammation in patients with IBD.DISCUSSIONFor an inflammatory response to occur in the host, there must be an initial event (e.g. infection and trauma). This event either triggers an explosive cellular infiltration response that may result in injury to the tissues of the host or a protective innate immune response. This protective immune response may become uncontrolled due to predisposing factors, such as the genetics of the individual in cases of UC or CD (7Zeitz M. Digestion. 1997; 58 Suppl. 1: 59-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Patients with UC and CD exhibit increased permeability of their intestinal mucosa (6van Dullemen H. Meenan J. Stronkhorst A. Tytgat G.N. van Deventer S.J. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 223 (suppl.): 92-98Google Scholar), which allows bacterial products, such as LPS, to penetrate the lamina propria from the intestinal lumen and to bind to its receptor, CD14, on macrophages to induce transcriptional activation of a number of genes. Likewise, antiglycan antibodies to the cell wall mannan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mycobacterial antigens are highly correlated with Crohn's disease (56El-Zaatari F.A. Naser S.A. Hulten K. Burch P. Graham D.Y. Curr. Microbiol. 1999; 39: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 57Schultsz C. Van Den Berg F.M. Ten Kate F.W. Tytgat G.N. Dankert J.

Gut. 2000; 46: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). LPS is a known stimulator of the immune response and of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα, which can lead to an inflammatory state. LPS also increases the production of PGs, which are synthesized from AA liberated from cell membranes by phospholipases. Several phospholipases have been characterized (e.g. PLA2, PLC, and PLD), but the contribution of these to PG production has not been thoroughly studied. Furthermore, it is unknown how various phospholipases are regulated in a cell. These studies therefore were designed to demonstrate the contribution of various phospholipases in PG production and to determine the role of a regulatory protein (PLAA) in controlling phospholipase activity in a cell.Among various genes activated by LPS in host cells, we sought to delineate the role of PLAA, a G-like regulatory protein (59Peitsch M.C. Borner C. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 292-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), in PGE2 production, as its level was up-regulated within minutes in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Fig. 1 A). To define the role of PLAA in eicosanoid formation, we used plaaantisense oligonucleotide, and we demonstrated that it decreased levels of AA release in LPS-stimulated cells (Fig. 4). In addition, theplaa antisense oligonucleotide-pretreated cells reduced LPS-induced cPLA2 levels, indicating the direct role of PLAA in controlling cPLA2. These data demonstrated the importance of PLAA in the regulation of eicosanoid formation at the initial rate-limiting step of substrate (AA) formation. The ability of PLAA to increase sPLA2 activity in rheumatoid arthritis as well as in cell extracts of BC3H1 cells has been reported, thus making PLAA an important regulatory component in inflammation (1Bomalaski J.S. Clark M.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 279: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,60Clark M.A. Ozgur L.E. Conway T.M. Dispoto J. Crooke S.T. Bomalaski J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1990; 275: 125-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the possibility that PLAA may regulate additional phospholipases (e.g. PLC and PLD) cannot be ruled out, and these studies are currently under investigation. The ability of melittin, which exhibits homology within the sequence of PLAA (62Saini S.S. Peterson J.W. Chopra A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), to produce PGE2 via activation of PLC and PLD, in addition to PLA2 (Fig. 6 A), points to the possible role of PLAA in regulating various phospholipases.In addition to LPS, stimulation of macrophages was examined with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα, which also resulted in increased levels of PLAA at early (within 10 min) time points (Fig. 3,A and B). However, saturation of cells with the highest tested concentration of TNFα (500 ng/ml) also resulted in PLAA expression at a later time point of 120 min (Fig. 3 B). These findings, in conjunction with the reported ability of PLAA to increase cytokine production (63Bomalaski J.S. Steiner M.R. Simon P.L. Clark M.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 155-160PubMed Google Scholar, 64Bomalaski J.S. Ford T. Hudson A.P. Clark M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4027-4031PubMed Google Scholar, 65Clark M.A. Chen M.J. Crooke S.T. Bomalaski J.S. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), led to the possibility of an autocrine role of PLAA, which could result in perpetuating the inflammatory response. The rapid induction of the plaa gene in macrophages by LPS, IL-1β, and TNFα coincided with an early increase in cPLA2 and PGE2 levels, with concomitant increases in the PLA2 activity (Figs.1 B, 2, and 3 A), indicating the role of PLAA and cPLA2 in initiating AA metabolism. The role of cPLA2 in the production of early phase PGE2 has been reported in mast cells and fibroblasts (17Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Fujishima H. Sanchez Mejia R.O. Bingham III, C.O. Lam B.K. Sapirstein A. Bonventre J.V. Austen K.F.

However, some studies have indicated a role for cPLA2 in COX-2-dependent, delayed PGE2 production (23Murakami M. Kuwata H. Amakasu Y. Shimbara S. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Kudo I. J. Biol.

Likewise, most Western analysis on PLAA has utilized antibodies to melittin, rather than to PLAA. This has resulted in some confusion regarding the size of PLAA, as antibodies to melittin resulted in the identification of PLAA in IL-1β-stimulated rabbit distal colon cells at ∼45 kDa plausibly representing a degraded version of PLAA (67Homaidan F.R. Zhao L. Burakoff R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1338-G1346PubMed Google Scholar), whereas antibodies to PLAA synthetic peptides we have generated resulted in the identification of a band of ∼72 kDa, which is the correct size of the full-length PLAA (44Chopra A.K. Ribardo D.A. Wood T.G. Prusak D.J. Xu X.J. Peterson J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The ability of the plaa gene to be up-regulated rapidly after induction, and its homology with numerous G protein β-subunits, which regulate the activities of many cellular enzymes (59Peitsch M.C. Borner C. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 292-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), prompted us to determine whether PLAA requires phosphorylation for its activity. Immunoprecipitation studies with cells stimulated with LPS revealed PLAA to be phosphorylated both at 0- and 10-min time points, indicating that although phosphorylation may be needed for the function of PLAA, it does not regulate its activity, as is the case with many other intermediate signaling molecules.The purported role of melittin as an sPLA2 activator is widely known (45Steiner M.R. Bomalaski J.S. Clark M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 68Maulet Y. Brodbeck U. Fulpius B.W. Anal.

Melittin is also highly hemolytic to sheep red blood cells; however, downstream effects of melittin on cells have not been described (72Werkmeister J.A. Kirkpatrick A. McKenzie J.A. Rivett D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1157: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The homology of PLAA to melittin led us to ascertain the effects melittin had directly on macrophages, which could then be correlated back to PLAA. As shown in Fig. 5, melittin caused increases in abundance of message for both TNFα and COX-2 as measured by Northern blot analysis. PGE2 levels were elevated in macrophages treated with melittin, and these increased levels were mediated primarily by PLC and to a lesser extent by PLD and PLA2 (Fig. 6 A).Melittin also blocked many of the toxic effects of Lipid A, such as pyrogenicity in the rabbit model and lethality of chick embryos by preventing Lipid A from binding its receptor (73David S.A. Mathan V.I. Balaram P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the effects melittin has on LPS-induced PGE2 production have not been examined. Interestingly, melittin reduced PGE2 levels in LPS-stimulated RAW cells by ∼75% (Fig. 6 B). The exact mechanism of reduced PGE2 production by melittin in LPS-stimulated cells is currently unknown, but it has been hypothesized that melittin could prevent binding of LPS to its receptor (73David S.A. Mathan V.I. Balaram P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Alternatively, melittin has been reported to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of PLA2 (62Saini S.S. Peterson J.W. Chopra A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on these reports (62Saini S.S. Peterson J.W. Chopra A.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 73David S.A. Mathan V.I. Balaram P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), melittin would be expected to antagonize the effect of LPS on PLA2 activity and subsequent PGE2 production. Synthetic peptides of PLAA that share this region of homology with melittin could be developed to block LPS-induced PGE2production to help abrogate the immune response.Since it is unknown whether PLAA regulates more than one kind of phospholipase and since the relative contribution of each of the phospholipases upon PG production has not been thoroughly investigated in the literature, we sought to establish the involvement of PLA2, PLC, and PLD in PG synthesis. Through the use of various inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides, our results indicated that several phospholipases are involved in PG production as inhibitors to sPLA2, cPLA2,"

In some cases, peptides with C-terminally extended Gly residues are further processed into C-terminally amidated peptides by peptidyl-glycine-α-amidating monooxygenase (4Mains R.E. Dickerson I.M.

These enzymes are homologous to KEX-2, a yeast peptide-processing enzyme, and have been designated prohormone convertases (PCs)1 (5Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin.

Among the members of the PC family, PC1 (also known as PC3) and PC2 exhibit a restricted neuroendocrine distribution, suggesting that these enzymes play a key role in the endoproteolytic processing of a number of neuropeptides and peptide hormones (9Seidah N.G.

Carboxypeptidase E (CPE; also known as EC 3.4.17.10 and CPH) is the enzyme responsible for the C-terminal trimming of the majority of peptide hormones and neurotransmitters (3Fricker L.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Support for the involvement of CPE in the processing of neuroendocrine peptides comes from studies on the Cpe fat /Cpe fat mouse. These mice lack active CPE due to a point mutation (serine 202 to proline) in a highly conserved region of the enzyme (12Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O. Nishina P.M. Rouille Y. Steiner D.F. Carroll R.J. Paigen B.J. Leiter E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Without CPE activity, these mice show deficiency in C-terminal trimming of basic residues from the processing intermediates (13Fricker L.D. Berman Y.L. Leiter E.H. Devi L.A. J. Biol.

These changes point to an alteration in the endoproteolytic processing of neuropeptides and hormone precursors in Cpe fat /Cpe fatmice. Using affinity chromatography to isolate substrates of CPE from theCpe fat /Cpe fat mice (i.e. Lys- and Arg-extended peptides), a number of novel peptides were identified (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning revealed that several of these peptides belonged to a single precursor, designated “proSAAS” (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ProSAAS mRNA is expressed primarily in the brain and other neuroendocrine tissues. When expressed in AtT-20 cells, proSAAS is secreted via the regulated pathway and is also processed at paired basic cleavage sites into smaller peptides. ProSAAS was found to be a potent inhibitor of PC1 in vitro (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the inhibitory region was mapped to a short 8-residue sequence near the C terminus of the protein (17Qian Y. Devi L.A.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ProSAAS showed some similar characteristics to granins, a loosely defined family of neuroendocrine proteins that includes chromogranin A, chromogranin B, secretogranin II, and a protein designated 7B2. These granin proteins have been shown to undergo proteolytic processing in neuroendocrine tissues (19Muller L. Lindberg I. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 69-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 20Natori S. Huttner W.B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 76: 277-282Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Li J-Y. Leitner B. Lovisetti-Scamihorn P. Winkler H. Dahlstrom A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 528-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear if the primary function of these proteins is as neuropeptide precursors. To gain insight as to the function of proSAAS and the proSAAS-derived peptides, it is important to identify the major forms of this protein in wild-type mouse brain and pituitary. The finding that the majority of proSAAS is processed into smaller peptides raises the possibility that these peptides possess physiological functions, possibly as neuroendocrine hormones or neurotransmitters. The antisera to proSAAS-(42–59) (little SAAS), proSAAS-(221–242) (PEN), and proSAAS-(245–260) (big LEN) were the generous gift of Dr. James Douglass (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). These antisera were raised against synthetic peptides with additional N-terminal Cys residues that were conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Each of the three peptides was used for production of antiserum in three rabbits. These nine antisera were screened against radioiodinated peptides with amino-terminal Tyr synthesized for this purpose; peptides were iodinated by the Chloramine-T method, and the radiolabeled tracers were purified on a PD-10 gel filtration column (Sephadex G-25M; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Of the three antisera to each peptide, the one with the highest sensitivity was selected for further studies: little SAAS (rabbit number 2766), PEN (rabbit number 141), and big LEN (rabbit number 85). Synthetic peptide standards were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline. Antibody dilutions that bind 30%of the radioactivity (1:3000 for anti-SAAS and anti-LEN and 1:4500 for anti-PEN) were added in a RIA buffer (150 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1%gelatin (Bio-Rad), 0.1%bovine serum albumin (protease-free; Sigma), 0.1%Triton X-100, and 0.02%sodium azide); among the buffers tested, this RIA buffer was found to decrease nonspecific binding and increase the sensitivity of the assay. The tubes were incubated overnight at 4 °C, and then 100 μl of goat anti-rabbit globulin and 100 μl of normal rabbit serum were added. The antigen-antibody complex was separated from the unbound radioligand according to the manufacturer's protocol (Peninsula). The concentrations of nonradioactive peptides required to reduce tracer binding by 50%(i.e. IC50 values) were 900 fmol/tube for SAAS, 300 fmol/tube for PEN, and 200 fmol/tube for LEN, and the IC20 values were 200 fmol/tube for SAAS, 90 fmol/tube for PEN, and 25 fmol/tube for LEN. To determine the specificity of each antiserum, synthetic peptides or glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins representing various portions of proSAAS (17Qian Y. Devi L.A. Mzhavia N. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23596-23601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were used (see Fig. 1 for the position of these peptides within the proSAAS sequence). Balb/c mice (Taconic Farms, NY),Cpe fat /Cpe fat C57BLKS/J mice and wild type littermates (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were maintained in individual cages on a 12-h light/dark cycle. The animals were sacrificed by decapitation, and the brains were removed. Gross dissection of brain regions was according to Glowinski and Iversen (22Glowinski J. Iversen L.L. J. Neurochem. 1966; 13: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (5032) Google Scholar). The pituitary was separated into anterior (AL) and neurointermediate (NIL) lobe under a dissecting microscope. Dissected tissues were kept at −80 °C until use. Tissues were extracted in 10 volumes of one of five different buffers (described below), homogenates were subjected to centrifugation (13,000 × g for 30 min, 4 °C), and the pellets were reextracted with 10 volumes of second extraction buffer (see below). Following recentrifugation, supernatants from both extractions were dried separately using a Speed Vac concentrator (Savant) and stored at −20 °C. Prior to RIAs and/or gel exclusion chromatography, samples from both extractions were resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2%Triton X-100 and pooled. To determine the optimal extraction conditions, five different protocols were tested: (1) homogenization in boiling water followed by incubation at 100 °C for 10 min and a second extraction in ice-cold 1 m acetic acid, (2) homogenization in boiling 0.15m acetic acid followed by incubation at 100 °C for 10 min and a second extraction in 0.1 m acetic acid/methanol (1:1), (3) homogenization in ice-cold 1 m acetic acid and a second extraction in methanol plus 0.1 m acetic acid (1:1), (4) homogenization in ice-cold ethanol plus 0.8 nHCl (3:1) with no second extraction, and (5) homogenization in ice-cold Tris buffer plus 1 m acetic acid (1:1) and a second extraction in ethanol plus 1 m acetic acid (1:4); the Tris buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2%Triton X-100, 280 μm tosyl-prolyl chloromethyl ketone, 140 μm tosyl-lysyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 μm E-64, and 1 μm pepstatin. Among these, the first extraction condition was found to be optimal, since the level of immunoreactive peptides were ∼2-fold higher under these conditions as compared with other conditions. Also, the recovery of radiolabeled peptides using the first extraction condition was 85–90%, indicating no significant breakdown of peptides during extraction. Furthermore, when the material from the first and second extraction conditions was subjected to gel filtration chromatography (described below) comparable profiles were seen for all three peptides examined. Therefore, the first extraction conditions were routinely used for further characterization. Gel exclusion chromatography was performed on Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sample in a total volume of 50–100 μl was applied to the column and separated with 0.1%trifluoroacetic acid containing 30%acetonitrile (Fisher). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min; 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were dried and resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2%Triton X-100 and subjected to RIA. The material representing the highest immunoreactive peptides was pooled and subjected to HPLC on a 5-μm, 250 × 4.6-mm C18 column (Column Engineering, Inc., Ontario, CA). A linear gradient of 0–75%acetonitrile in 0.1%trifluoroacetic acid was used to separate the peptides (75 min, 1 ml/min, 0.5-min fractions). Retention times of synthetic big SAAS, little SAAS, PEN, little LEN, and big LEN were determined by absorbance in a separate run. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) spectra were obtained in positive linear mode on a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Framingham, MA). Approximately 100 laser shots were summed per spectrum. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated in 30%acetonitrile and 0.1%trifluoroacetic acid in water was used as a matrix. External calibration was performed with des-Arg1-bradykinin ([M + H]+ = 904.4681) and neurotensin ([M + H]+ = 1672.9170). Electrospray time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) spectra were recorded on a Perseptive Biosystems Mariner mass spectrometer (Framingham, MA). Samples were introduced directly into the Mariner by infusion. System tuning and mass calibration were performed with angiotensin I ([M + H]+ = 1296.6853, [M + 2H]2+ = 648.8466, and [M + 3H]3+ = 432.9003). The antisera used in this study were raised against three peptides derived from different regions of proSAAS. Little SAAS (proSAAS-(42–59)) represents an 18-residue peptide that is derived from the N-terminal region; PEN (proSAAS-(221–242)) is a 22-residue peptide from the C-terminal region; and big LEN (proSAAS-(245–260)) is a 16-residue peptide and includes the C terminus of proSAAS (Fig.1). All of the antisera raised in rabbit exhibit reasonably high sensitivity toward the immunogenic peptide (Table I). To characterize the specificity of these antisera, we used a number of synthetic peptides and glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins that contained various regions of proSAAS (Table I). The anti-SAAS antibody recognizes proSAAS-(34–59) (designated “big SAAS”) and little SAAS but does not recognize proSAAS-(34–40) (designated “KEP”). This antiserum also recognizes the full-length proSAAS, albeit at somewhat reduced levels (∼30%), suggesting that the anti-SAAS antibody is directed to the middle portion of little SAAS and that it is able to recognize N- and C-terminally extended peptides with fairly high efficiency. The anti-PEN antibody is also able to recognize C-terminally extended peptides such as proSAAS-(221–260) (“big PEN-LEN”) or proSAAS-(221–254) (“little PEN-LEN”). In contrast, the anti-LEN antibody recognizes only big LEN but not the C-terminally truncated peptide, proSAAS-(245–254) (“little LEN”) (Table I). These results suggest that the epitope for this antiserum includes the C-terminal 6 residues of proSAAS. This is confirmed by the inability of anti-LEN antibody to recognize little PEN-LEN, although it is able to recognize big PEN-LEN (Table I). Taken together, these results indicate that the three antisera recognize different domains of proSAAS and that they are able to recognize the processed peptides as well as partially processed peptides and the unprocessed precursor.Table ICharacterization of antisera against SAAS, PEN, and LEN peptidesPeptideIC50Anti-SAASAnti-PENAnti-LENpmolProSAAS-(42–59) (little SAAS)0.9 (100%)>10000>10000ProSAAS-(34–59) (big SAAS)1.0 (90%)>10000>10000ProSAAS-(34–40) (KEP)>10000>10000>10000ProSAAS-(221–242) (PEN)>100000.3 (100%)>10000ProSAAS-(221–260) (big PEN-LEN)>100000.38 (79%)0.21 (95%)ProSAAS-(221–254) (little PEN-LEN)>100000.38 (79%)>10000ProSAAS-(245–260) (big LEN)>10000>100000.2 (100%)ProSAAS-(245–254) (little LEN)>10000>10000>10000GST-proSAAS-(34–260)2.8 (32%)9.5 (3%)9.5 (2%)GST-proSAAS-(34–232)2.8 (32%)7.1 (4%)>10000GST-proSAAS-(34–174)5.3 (17%)>10000>10000The data represent mean of triplicate determinations from two independent studies. Open table in a new tab The data represent mean of triplicate determinations from two independent studies. The relative levels of proSAAS-derived peptides were measured in various regions of mouse brain and pituitary. The highest levels of all three peptides are found in the hypothalamus; the other brain regions contain 3–30-fold lower levels (TableII). The relative levels of these peptides vary between brain regions. For example, the levels of immunoreactive SAAS are comparable in pons/medulla and striatum; however, the levels of immunoreactive PEN are substantially higher in pons/medulla (Table II). Similarly, in AL and NIL of the pituitary, the levels of immunoreactive PEN are substantially higher than the levels of the other two peptides. In other areas, such as striatum and NIL, the levels of immunoreactive LEN are substantially lower than the levels of the other two peptides (Table II). These differences could be due to the differential processing of the precursor in these tissues leading to the generation of peptides that are recognized by the antisera to different extents. Taken together, these results suggest that proSAAS is differentially processed in various regions of the brain and pituitary.Table IIProSAAS-derived peptides in mouse brain regions and pituitaryBrain regionsTissue weightIr SAASIr PENIr LENmgpmol/g tissueHypothalamus13283 ± 23389 ± 48201 ± 20Pons/Medulla6071 ± 4138 ± 974 ± 6Striatum1566 ± 853 ± 829 ± 5Midbrain12038 ± 370 ± 439 ± 5Hippocampus3338 ± 238 ± 633 ± 5Cortex19027 ± 244 ± 726 ± 2Cerebellum10014 ± 113 ± 17 ± 2PituitaryIr SAASIr PENIr LENpmol Ir peptide/lobeAnterior lobeND0.5 ± 0.122.6 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.05Neurointermediate lobeND0.8 ± 0.063.1 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.07The data represent mean ± S.E. from triplicate determinations with three animals; ND, not done; Ir, immunoreactive.

To examine the extent of processing of the precursor in the brain, the extract from brains of Balb/c mice was subjected to gel filtration chromatography followed by RIA with the antisera described above. We find a broad peak of immunoreactive SAAS eluting between 3.5 and 1.9 kDa (Fig. 2). This could represent a mixture of big SAAS, little SAAS, and/or partially processed SAAS-containing higher molecular weight peptides. The immunoreactive PEN also elutes as a broad peak between 3.2 and 1.9 kDa; this could represent fully processed PEN and other PEN-containing peptides (such as little PEN-LEN). In contrast, immunoreactive LEN elutes as a sharp peak at ∼2 kDa (Fig. 2). Because the anti-LEN antibody does not recognize little LEN, it is likely that this immunoreactive peptide represents big LEN. Taken together, these results indicate that proSAAS is processed to lower molecular weight peptides in mouse brain. To further characterize these peptides, pools of fractions representing peaks of immunoreactivity (fractions 24–27) were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC under conditions that separate the fully processed peptides from each other. The majority of immunoreactive SAAS elutes at the position of little SAAS (Fig. 3). Similar HPLC analysis of pools of fractions 22 and 23 also revealed only little SAAS and no big SAAS (not shown), supporting the notion that the major immunoreactive SAAS in mouse brain is little SAAS. Immunoreactive PEN elutes as four peaks, one of which corresponds to PEN (Fig. 3). The other three peaks could correspond to N- or C-terminally extended PEN-containing peptides or to post-translationally modified PEN. Because LEN immunoreactivity is not detected in these fractions, it is unlikely that these peptides represent big PEN-LEN, although little PEN-LEN (which is not detected by the anti-LEN antiserum) may be present. Immunoreactive LEN elutes at the position of big LEN (Fig. 3); little LEN could not be detected in our system, since it does not contain the epitope recognized by the LEN antiserum. To confirm the identity of these peptides, fractions that contained the peaks of immunoreactivity following HPLC were subjected to mass spectrometry using both MALDI-TOF and ESI-TOF. The MALDI-TOF spectrum of HPLC fraction 37 shows a number of ions in the mass range 1335–4936 (Fig. 4). Because the sample represents only gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC, it is expected to contain many peptides. A peak at 1755.98 is detected as a moderately strong signal. This is precisely the calculated monoisotopic mass of protonated big LEN. The ion is much weaker in fractions 36 and 38 and is completely absent from the other spectra analyzed. Similar MALDI-TOF analysis of HPLC fractions 30–58 did not reveal any close similarities to the predicted masses of other proSAAS fragments, although some of these fractions contained such a large number of other ions that a very strong signal for the proSAAS fragment would have been required for detection. To reduce the problems of ion suppression that occur when many ions are present, some of the fractions were analyzed by ESI-TOF. HPLC fraction 43, which contains immunoreactive SAAS, was found by ESI-TOF to contain a small but detectable peak at 907.09 (Fig.4 B). This peak is doubly protonated, based on analysis of the enlarged spectra (Fig. 4 B, inset) and corresponds to an uncharged monoisotopic parent mass of 1812.18. This mass is within 0.01%of the predicted mass of little SAAS (1812.00). Taken together with the elution pattern of the immunoreactive peptides, this is strong evidence that big LEN and little SAAS represent the immunoreactive material detected in the HPLC fractions and that these are the major fragments of these peptides in mouse brain. Previous studies have found that the endoproteolytic processing of a number of peptide hormones are substantially decreased inCpe fat /Cpe fat mice (12Naggert J.K. Fricker L.D. Varlamov O.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2954-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To examine if the processing of proSAAS is altered in these animals, brain extracts from Cpe fat /Cpe fat and wild-type littermates were subjected to gel filtration chromatography followed by RIA. In theCpe fat /Cpe fat mouse brain, there is a reduction in the level of processed lower molecular weight immunoreactive SAAS peptides and a small increase in the partially processed higher molecular weight forms (Fig.5). There is also a decrease in the levels of immunoreactive PEN and a shift to a slightly higher molecular weight form in the mice lacking CPE activity (Fig. 5). In contrast to immunoreactive PEN and immunoreactive SAAS, there is an increase in the level of immunoreactive LEN in these mice (Fig. 5). Because the anti-LEN antiserum recognizes only big LEN and not little LEN, these results suggest that the proteolytic cleavage that generates little LEN is not as efficient inCpe fat /Cpe fat mice compared with control mice. The processing profile of proSAAS was also examined in the AL and the NIL of the pituitary. The gel filtration profile of immunoreactive SAAS is altered in the NIL ofCpe fat /Cpe fat mice, with a slight accumulation of higher molecular weight SAAS-containing intermediate forms (Fig. 6, top). In AL, there is a small shift in the size of immunoreactive SAAS in theCpe fat /Cpe fat mice, possibly reflecting the accumulation of Arg-extended peptide (Fig. 6,top). There is also a small shift in the molecular weight of immunoreactive PEN in the AL ofCpe fat /Cpe fat but no substantial change in the NIL (Fig. 6, middle). The level of immunoreactive LEN in AL is comparable betweenCpe fat /Cpe fat and wild type mice, whereas there is a substantial increase in the level of immunoreactive LEN in NIL of Cpe fat /Cpe fat mice as compared with wild type mice (Fig. 6, bottom). These results suggest a decrease in the processing of LEN in NIL of these mice, leading to the accumulation of big LEN. Thus, it appears that in addition to the defect in carboxypeptidase activity in theCpe fat /Cpe fat mice, these mice also have a defect in endoproteolytic activity that leads to small changes in the processing of proSAAS by endopeptidases. ProSAAS is a recently characterized protein with some characteristics in common with the granins (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is no amino acid sequence homology between granins, except for between chromogranins A and B, the granins are considered a family because they are all broadly expressed neuroendocrine proteins that are secreted via the regulated pathway. In addition, the granins contain a relatively high abundance of acidic residues, and they also contain multiple pairs of basic amino acids. However, most of the granins are not processed extensively at these pairs of basic residues, raising doubts as to whether these proteins are primarily precursors of neuroendocrine peptides. Although proSAAS generally fits these loose criteria of granins, our finding that proSAAS is extensively processed in brain and pituitary argues against this protein being a chromogranin A- or B-like granin and instead suggests that this protein functions as a neuroendocrine peptide precursor. Peptides derived from proSAAS were previously identified inCpe fat /Cpe fat mice using a novel approach to isolate incorrectly processed peptides (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the techniques previously used could not determine whether these processed peptides represented major or minor forms of proSAAS. The gel filtration and RIA methods used in the present study are quantitative and complement the previous analyses. A concern with RIAs is that the antisera may not be specific for the peptide or protein; if so, the detected signal may be due to some other peptide or protein. In the present study, this is unlikely for several reasons. First, our RIA data show high levels of SAAS, PEN, and LEN in the hypothalamus, consistent with the distribution of proSAAS mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis and by in situ hybridization (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The generally similar pattern of expression of all three peptides further validates the RIA. Second, the use of gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC to show coelution of the immunoreactive SAAS and immunoreactive LEN with little SAAS and big LEN, respectively, is further evidence that these peptides are responsible for the RIA signal. Finally, the finding that peptides with the mass of little SAAS and big LEN are present in the appropriate HPLC fractions is strong confirmation that these peptides are produced in wild-type mouse brain. The reduced level in brain and NIL of immunoreactive LEN (representing big LEN) in wild type as compared withCpe fat /Cpe fat mice suggests a role for PC1 or PC2 in the generation of little LEN; both of these enzymes are thought to be less active in theCpe fat /Cpe fat mice compared with wild type mice (23Berman Y. Mzhavia N. Polonskaia A. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1466-1473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because the difference in immunoreactive LEN levels between the Cpe fat /Cpe fatand control animals is much greater in the NIL than in the AL, it is likely that PC2 is primarily involved in processing big LEN into little LEN. PC2 is abundant in the intermediate pituitary and is thought to process β-lipotropin to β-endorphin and to cleave adrenocorticotropic hormone into the α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone precursor (24Benjannet S. Rondeau N. Day R. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3564-3568Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 25Day R. Schafer M.K. Watson S.J. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recent studies in transgenic animals lacking PC2 have shown an involvement of this enzyme in the generation of small bioactive peptide hormones and neuropeptides (26Furuta M. Carroll R. Martin S.

Pintar J.E. Devi L.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1763-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, a role for PC2 in processing big LEN into little LEN would be consistent with this enzyme's actions on other peptides. ProSAAS has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of PC1 (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies by two independent groups have narrowed down the PC1-inhibitory region to a short region of proSAAS near the junction of PEN and LEN (17Qian Y. Devi L.A. Mzhavia N. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23596-23601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Cameron A. Fortenberry Y. Lindberg I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). While the fully processed form of PEN is not inhibitory (17Qian Y. Devi L.A. Mzhavia N. Munzer S. Seidah N.G. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23596-23601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the Lys-Arg-extended PEN peptide inhibits PC1 activity (18Cameron A. Fortenberry Y. Lindberg I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). InCpe fat /Cpe fat mice, the lack of CPE activity results in the accumulation of PEN-Lys-Arg (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this peptide may affect the autocatalytic maturation of PC1. Consistent with this possibility, the maturation and activity of PC1 are decreased inCpe fat /Cpe fat (23Berman Y. Mzhavia N. Polonskaia A. Devi L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1466-1473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In previous studies using mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation to examine the processing of proSAAS in AtT-20 cells overexpressing this protein, several products were detected including big SAAS, little SAAS, PEN, big LEN, little PEN/LEN, and big PEN/LEN. In the present study, wild type mice brains were found to have substantial amounts of little SAAS, PEN, and big LEN, but not big SAAS, big PEN/LEN, or larger forms of these peptides. Thus, while PEN/LEN and larger forms of this peptide are inhibitory to PC1, the finding that the major forms in wild type mouse brain and pituitary are the smaller noninhibitory forms suggests that PC1 is not tonically inhibited by the proSAAS peptides. Furthermore, the extensive processing of proSAAS implies that this protein is a neuropeptide precursor. While any peptide produced in neural tissue could be considered a “neuropeptide,” this term is usually reserved for peptides that function in signaling between cells. The criteria for establishing a peptide as a signaling molecule include demonstrating that it is produced in neuroendocrine cells, that it is secreted upon stimulation, and that it binds to a cellular receptor, causing changes in second messengers. The present results are strong evidence that little SAAS and big LEN are produced in brain and pituitary, and thus are candidate “neuropeptides.” Previous studies have shown that in AtT-20 cells, proSAAS is routed into the regulated secretory pathway (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A. Douglass J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown that the immunoreactive SAAS and immunoreactive LEN are secreted upon stimulation. 2N. Mzhavia and L. A. Devi, unpublished results. However, it is essential that a receptor for the peptides be found before they can be considered signaling molecules. Now, with the evidence presented here that little SAAS and big LEN are major products of proSAAS in brain, it is possible to begin searching for specific receptors for these peptides. We thank Dr. James Douglass for providing antisera and some of the peptides and Haiteng Deng for assistance with the Mariner mass spectrometry, which was performed in the Laboratory of Macromolecular Analysis of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine."

Both transport dopamine with higher affinity than norepinephrine and are targets for the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine. However, they strikingly contrast in their affinities for tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). Previous studies, based on chimeric proteins between DAT and NET suggest that domains ranging from putative transmembrane domain (TMD) 5 to 8 are involved in the high affinity binding of TCA to NET. We substituted 24 amino acids within this region in the human NET with their counterparts in the human DAT, resulting in 22 different mutants. Mutations of residues located in extra- or intracytoplasmic loops have no effect on binding affinity of neither TCA nor cocaine. Three point mutations in TMD6 (F316C), -7 (V356S), and -8 (G400L) induced a loss of TCA binding affinity of 8-, 5-, and 4-fold, respectively, without affecting the affinity of cocaine. The triple mutation F316C/V356S/G400L produced a 40-fold shift in desipramine affinity. These three residues are strongly conserved in all TCA-sensitive transporters cloned in mammalian and nonmammalian species. A strong shift in TCA affinity (IC50) was also observed for double mutants F316C/D336T (35-fold) and S399P/G400L (80-fold for nortriptyline and 1000-fold for desipramine). Reverse mutations P401S/L402G in hDAT did not elicit any gain in TCA affinities, whereas C318F and S358V resulted in a 3- and 10-fold increase in affinity, respectively. Our results clearly indicate that two residues located in TMD6 and -7 of hNET may play an important role in TCA interaction and that a critical region in TMD8 is likely to be involved in the tertiary structure allowing the high affinity binding of TCA.

DAT and NET are the most closely related members of this subfamily with about 80% similarity (65% identity) in their amino acid sequences. These two transporters also share several pharmacological properties, e.g. both transport DA with a higher affinity than NE (16Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 21Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1030-1037PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

On the other hand, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), which elicit their antidepressant effects through blockade of NET (23Glowinski J. Axelrod J.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 957-965PubMed Google Scholar), are highly discriminative drugs between NET and DAT. For example, the TCA desipramine and nortriptyline inhibit NET in the nanomolar range whereas they inhibit DAT in the micromolar range (21Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1030-1037PubMed Google Scholar, 26Giros B. Wang Y.M. Suter S. McLeskey S.B. Pifl C. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15985-15988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the structure/activity relationships of the family of Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters, several groups have used site-directed mutagenesis and/or generation of chimeric proteins. Experiments using mutagenesis have been designed to investigate the role of amino acids endowed with a functional moiety possibly involved in mechanisms such as charge transfer (e.g. Lys, Arg, Glu, and Asp) (27Kitayama S.

Functional chimeras have been successfully constructed between the two closely related monoamine transporters rat DAT and human NET (21Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1030-1037PubMed Google Scholar, 35Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), between human DAT and NET (26Giros B. Wang Y.M. Suter S. McLeskey S.B. Pifl C. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15985-15988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), between rat and human SERT (36Barker E.L. Kimmel H.L. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 799-807PubMed Google Scholar), and between the SERT and NET second extracellular loop (37Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M.Y. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because DAT and NET are similar, yet with distinct pharmacological differences, chimeras between DAT and NET were extremely informative: the loss of TCA binding in NET is observed either for proteins that comprise TMD6 to TMD 8 of DAT (chimera M (26Giros B. Wang Y.M. Suter S. McLeskey S.B. Pifl C. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15985-15988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), or for proteins that fuse the NH2-terminal region of DAT to the COOH-terminal region of NET between TMD5 and TMD9 (chimera DN5 (35Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)) or between TMD8 and TMD9 (chimera DN8 (35Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)). Thus, determinants within a region spanning TMD5–8 appear to be important for conferring TCA sensitivity. In addition, cocaine had absolutely no inhibitory effect on human chimera M. Therefore this domain may also play a crucial role in the uptake inhibition by various drugs. To identify which functional groups may interact with TCA, we have performed site-directed mutagenesis on TMD6–8 of NET. The cassette from DAT that was exchanged in chimera M comprised 145 amino acids, among which 24 are strictly different and 17 are in the same conservative group when compared with NET (comprising Val to Ala changes). We suspected that one of the 24 nonconserved residues could be implicated in the high affinity for TCA. Therefore, we systematically mutated these 24 amino acids in TMD6 to TMD8 of human NET and substituted them with their counterparts in human DAT. The aim of this study was to generate NET mutants that lose their affinity for TCA and eventually to identify particular amino acids responsible for the high affinity binding of TCA to NET. [3H]Dopamine (42 Ci/mmol) and [3H]norepinephrine (36 Ci/mmol) were supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Dopamine, norepinephrine, nortriptyline, nomifensine, and desipramine were obtained from RBI (Natick, MA). Cocaine was kindly provided by Dr. M.-H. Thiebot (INSERM U288, Paris, France). All the mutants were constructed using polymerase chain reaction with primers containing a designed mutation. For hNET mutants H296S, K303C, A330S, D336T, I384F, H370Q/E371K/K373S/N375P, E377G, E382D, A384P, and S402A the polymerase chain reactions (Hi-Taq, Bioprobe systems, France) were performed with a modified NET as template, withBstEII and ClaI sites flanking TMD6 and TMD8 (described in Ref. 26Giros B. Wang Y.M. Suter S. McLeskey S.B. Pifl C. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15985-15988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, two independent polymerase chain reaction amplifications were performed with either Pi or Pf primers and an opposite mutated primer. Primers sequences are as follow (mutant number, orientations or as, position in the human NET nucleotide sequence (6Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G.

The reactions were then mixed two by two, and reamplified with Pi and Pf. The products were subcloned, sequenced, and individual mutants were excised as a BstEII-ClaI cassette and subcloned in BstEII-ClaI digested pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) containing NET (19Blakely R.D.

All clones were sequenced on both strands before use. Plasmids were purified either by cesium chloride gradient or Wizard maxipreps (Promega, France) preparations before use in transfection experiments. HEK293 cells were transfected by the calcium-phosphate method with wild-type or mutated NET cDNAs subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) containing the neomycin resistance gene. Three days after transfection, cells were selected for stable plasmid integration with 800 μg/ml Geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 weeks. Stable clones were then grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 without G418. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as already described (38Sur C. Betz H. Schloss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7639-7644Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected and nontransfected HEK293 cells were grown on polyornithine-coated coverslips inserted in the wells of six-well culture dishes. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were fixed with freshly prepared PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with ice-cold PBS for 2 min each. Permeabilization of cell membranes was performed with PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 0.12% gelatin for 20 min at 4 °C. Labeling with the primary antibodies, directed against a COOH-terminal peptide sequence of the human NET (C590–607 (39Brüss M. Hammermann R. Brimijoin S. Bönisch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), 1:250 dilution), was achieved in the same solution for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with ice-cold PBS. Immunofluorescence labeling was performed with an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma; 1:200 dilution) in PBS for 1 h. After three washes with ice-cold PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Immunostaining was visualized by confocal laser microscopy (Leica TCS-NT, New York) at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm (emission at 514 nm) at 600-fold magnification. We transfected either LLC-PK1 cells by electroporation (EquiBio, St. Louis, MO) using 1 to 4 μg of plasmid or COS-7 cells by the calcium-phosphate method using 5 to 10 μg of plasmid. No difference between the two cell lines was noticed, either in the substrate affinities or in the inhibitory constants of the drugs tested. The cells were cultured in 24-well tissue culture dishes and uptake experiments were performed 72 h after transfection, as already described (9Giros B. El, Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar). For the determination of IC50 values, uptake was performed for 10 min in uptake buffer (5 mm Tris base, 7.5 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ascorbic acid, 5 mmd-glucose; final pH 7.4) at 37 °C using 20 nm [3H]DA with competitors added 5 min before. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. For determination of K m andV max values, 20 nm[3H]DA was used with increasing concentrations of unlabeled DA (20 nm to 30 μm). Nonspecific accumulation of [3H]DA was determined in the presence of 10 μm nomifensine (9Giros B. El, Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake was terminated by rapid removal of the supernatant followed by two successive washes with ice-cold uptake buffer. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of 0.1 mNaOH and the radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Calculations of V max,K m, and IC50 were performed as previously described (9Giros B. El, Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar, 40Pifl C. Giros B. Caron M.G. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by GraphPad Prism software. Results were analyzed using Student's t test. We have generated 22 mutants of the human NET, in which amino acids in TMD6 to TMD8 were replaced with their counterparts in DAT (Fig.1) as well as five reverse mutations in the strategic residues of hDAT. After transient transfection in eukaryotic cells, most of the hNET mutants were able to transport tritiated DA (Table I) and NE (data not shown) with kinetic parameters (K m andV max) that were not significantly different from those of the wild-type transporters. However, hNET mutations S288I/N289D/N292R, located in the third extracellular loop (EL3) exhibited a 7-fold increased capacity for DA. Three mutants, modified in extra- (EL) or intracytoplasmic (IL) loops, were devoid of normal uptake activity. Mutant H296S (EL3) and H370Q/E371K/K373S/N375P (EL4) were completely inactive and mutant S420A (IL4) clearly exhibited less than 10% of wild-type NET transport activity. As this uptake was measured on whole intact cells, we wondered whether these mutants were correctly targeted and expressed at the plasma membrane in transfected cells. To address this issue all mutants were stably transfected in eukaryotic cells (HEK293). Transporter protein expression was examined in permeabilized cells by indirect immunofluorescence with confocal laser scanning microscopy using primary antibodies directed against a peptide sequence of the COOH-terminal end of NET (39Brüss M. Hammermann R. Brimijoin S. Bönisch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All mutants exhibiting an uptake activity (>10% of native transporters) were correctly expressed at the plasma membrane (not shown). Fig.2 shows that mutant hNET-H296S was not targeted to the plasma membrane, and that plasma membrane localization of H370Q/E371K/K373S/N375P and S420A was strongly reduced compared with the wild-type NET. These observations suggest that these amino acids could be implicated in plasma membrane targeting of NET. It should also be noted that the reverse hDAT double mutant P401G/L402S displayed a nonsignificant tendency toward NET affinity for DA with aK m value of 870 nm, whereas all other hDAT mutants displayed identical kinetic parameters as compared with the wild type hDAT.Table IKinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) of [3H]dopamine uptake in COS-7 cells expressing wild-type hNET, hDAT, hNET mutants or hDAT mutantsK m ± SEV maxnm% NEThNET730 ± 155100%hNET-H280R580 ± 30058%hNET-S288I/N289D/N292R700 ± 447702%hNET-H296SNo uptakehNET-K303C600 ± 23897%hNET-F316C800 ± 116280%hNET-A330S600 ± 42330%hNET-D336T300 ± 102134%hNET-F316C-D336T590 ± 36446%hNET-V356S980 ± 136190%hNET-I364F410 ± 122360%hNET-H370Q/E371K/K373S/N375PNo uptakehNET-H370Q/E371K/K373S/E377G190 ± 8680%hNET-N375P400 ± 91220%hNET-E377G/E382D/A384P500 ± 240280%hNET-S396A920 ± 230100%hNET-S399P620 ± 30074%hNET-G400L960 ± 34060%hNET-S399P/G400L830 ± 44896%hNET-F403A460 ± 80220%hNET-A413T230 ± 15120%hNET-S420ANo uptakehNET-F316C/V356S/G400L957 ± 17044%hDAT2,140 ± 920540%hDAT-C318F1,940 ± 300585%hDAT-S358V2,650 ± 96035%hDAT-P401S1,680 ± 510135%hDAT-L402G3,000 ± 300360%hDAT-P401G/L402S870 ± 230285%K m values are mean ± S.E. of three to six experiments, each performed in triplicate.

Under our experimental conditions, inhibition of DA uptake by cocaine was characterized by IC50 values of 91 and 260 nm for wild-type NET and DAT, respectively (TableII). In most of the mutants, the cocaine affinity remained in the range of that of the wild-type NET. Two NET mutants, mutant F316C and mutant H370Q/E371K/K373S/E377G, showed a slight but significant increase in their affinity for cocaine with IC50 values of 41 and 48 nm, respectively. Despite the fact that we have mutated almost all of the nonconserved amino acids between TMD6 and TMD8, we could not detect any loss of affinity in our hNET mutant collection as seen with chimera M (26Giros B.

Open table in a new tab Similar values were found whether wild-type transporters or NET mutants were expressed in COS-7 or LLC-PK1 cells, and calculations were performed on pooled values from experiments with both cell lines for NET, DAT, and each mutant. Values are mean ± S.E. of three to six experiments, each performed in triplicate. Statistics were performed using Student's t test. Under our experimental conditions, IC50 values for inhibition of DA uptake by NET and DAT, respectively, were 1.2 nm and 9.2 μm for desipramine, and 21 nm and 28.2 μm for nortriptyline (Fig. 3 and Table II). Our data clearly showed (Table II) that exchanges of amino acids located in the intracytoplasmic or extracytoplasmic loops had no significant effect on TCA affinities. This applies to mutants S288I/N289D/N292R and K303C within EL3, mutants A330S and D336T within IL3, and mutants H370Q/E371K/K373S/E377G/N375P and E377G/E382D/A384P within EL4. Neither did seven mutations in TMDs had any effect on TCA affinities, namely H280R within TMD5, F316C within TMD6 and I364F, S396A, S399P, F403A, and A413T within TMD8. In TMD6, a marked difference between DAT and NET was a change from Phe to Cys. Mutant F316C, in which this change was engineered, displayed a 6–8-fold loss of affinity for both desipramine and nortriptyline (Table II). Whereas the single mutation from Asp to Thr in IL3 (D336T) had no effect on TCA potency, the double mutant F316C/D336T exhibited a 30–50-fold decrease in the affinities for desipramine and nortriptyline (Table II). These results suggest a dominant role for Phe316, which is enhanced by the loss of a charged residue in IL3. In TMD7, the single mutation V356S induced a significant 2-fold shift in desipramine affinity and a 10-fold shift in nortriptyline affinity. In TMD8, we observed a significant 3–4-fold loss in desipramine and nortriptyline affinity for the mutant hNAT-G400L (Table II). Despite the fact that the single mutation S399P had no effect by itself, the consequences of amino acid exchanges were particularly impressive in the double mutant S399P/G400L. The desipramine competition curve fitted a two-site model (IC50(1) = 1 nm and IC50(2) = 2690 nm), whereas the nortriptyline competition curve did not fit adequately neither a one- nor a two-site model (global IC50 = 1670 nm) (Table II, Fig. 3). Therefore, as these mutations modify the classical one-site inhibition curve, it can be inferred that the different affinity states are reflecting"
https://openalex.org/W2162025736,"Previous studies have shown that human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) can incorporate several surface proteins of host origin. Recent findings indicate that host-encoded cell surface constituents retain their functionality when found embedded into the viral envelope. The primary objective of the current study was to define whether interaction between some specific virion-bound host proteins with their natural cognate ligands present on target cells could mediate intracellular signaling cascade(s). For this purpose, we have generated a whole series of isogenic virus stocks (NL4–3 backbone) bearing or not bearing on their surface foreign CD28, CD54 (ICAM-1), CD80 (B7-1) or CD86 (B7-2) proteins. Our results indicate that incubation of human T lymphoid cells with virions bearing host-derived B7-2 proteins and anti-CD3 antibody can potently activate HIV-1 long terminal repeat-driven gene expression. This up-regulating effect necessitates the involvement of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) as revealed by the use of vectors coding for dominant negative versions of both transcription factors (i.e. IκBα S32A/36A and dnNFAT) and band shift assays. The increase of NF-κB activity was abolished when infection with B7-2-bearing HIV-1 particles was performed in the presence of the fusion protein CTLA-4 Ig suggesting that the interaction between virally embedded B7-2 and CD28 on the target cell is responsible for the observed NF-κB induction. The findings presented here provide the first demonstration that host-encoded proteins acquired by HIV-1 can mediate signal transduction events."
https://openalex.org/W2050895304,"Fluid flow plays an important role in load-induced bone remodeling. However, the molecular mechanism of flow-induced signal transduction in osteoblasts remains unclear. In endothelial cells, fluid flow alters activation of NF-κB resulting in changes in expression of cell adhesion molecules. To test the hypothesis that fluid flow alters NF-κB activation and expression of cell adhesion molecules in osteoblastic cells, we examined the effect of oscillating fluid flow (OFF) on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced NF-κB activation in rat osteoblast-like UMR106 cells. We found that OFF inhibits NF-κB-DNA binding activities, especially TNF-α-induced p50-p65 heterodimer NF-κB activation and TNF-α-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mRNA expression. The inhibitory effects of OFF on both TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mRNA expression were shear stress-dependent and also increased with OFF exposure duration, indicating that OFF has potent effects on mechanotransduction pathways. OFF also inhibited TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation and TNF-α-induced IκB kinase (IKK) activity in a shear stress-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that IKK is an initial target molecule for OFF effects on osteoblastic cells. Thus, OFF inhibits TNF-α-induced IKK activation, leading to a decrease in phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory IκBα, which in turn results in the decrease of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and potentially the transcription of target genes.

Skeletal systems are maintained by continuous bone remodeling. Mechanical loading, as well as a number of biochemical factors, regulates this bone remodeling. Mechanotransduction in bone has been proposed to involve a variety of biophysical signals including electrical potentials (streaming potentials and piezoelectric effects) and direct transduction of matrix strain. Recent studies suggest that shear stress is an important biophysical signal in bone cell mechanotransduction (1Reich K.M. Gay C.V. Frangos J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Reich K.M. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C428-C432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Weinbaum S. Cowin S.C. Zeng Y.A. J. Biomech. 1994; 27: 339-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Indeed, experiments designed to discriminate between flow and strain effects suggest that fluid flow-induced shear stress is a more potent stimulator of bone cells than substrate deformation (4Owan I. Burr D.B. Turner C.H. Qiu J. Tu Y. Onyia J.E. Duncan R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: C810-C815Crossref Google Scholar, 5Smalt R. Mitchell T. Howard R.L. Chambers T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E751-E758PubMed Google Scholar). As bone tissue is loaded in vivo, extracellular fluid in the canalicular network experiences a heterogeneous pressurization in response to the deformation of the mineralized bone matrix, resulting in generation of fluid flow along pressure gradients. When loading is removed, pressure gradients and flows are reversed. These fluid motions are dynamic and oscillatory in nature. Recently, Jacobs et al. (6Jacobs C.R. Yellowley C.E. Davis B.R. Zhou Z. Donahue H.J. J. Biomech. 1998; 31: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) demonstrated that oscillating fluid flow (OFF),1 similar to what a bone cell might experience in vivo, mobilizes cytosolic calcium in osteoblastic cells. This was the first study to examine the effect of OFF on bone cells. Other studies have demonstrated that steady or pulsating fluid flow regulates many biochemical factors such as cytosolic calcium (4Owan I. Burr D.B. Turner C.H. Qiu J. Tu Y. Onyia J.E. Duncan R.L.

However, the precise mechanism by which bone cells convert biophysical signals, such as fluid flow-induced shear stress, into these biochemical signals remains unclear. A number of paracrine and autocrine factors have been identified that control bone remodeling. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, a cytokine synthesized in the bone microenvironment, has been shown to exert pleiotropic effects on osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cells (10Nanes M.S. McKoy W.M. Marx S.J. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Nanes M.S. Rubin J. Titus L. Hendy G.N. Catherwood B. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2577-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that TNF-α increases the production of interleukin-6 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor in osteoblastic cells, thereby indirectly promoting differentiation of osteoclasts and enhancing bone resorption (12Ishimi Y. Miyaura C. Jin C.H. Akatsu T. Abe E. Nakamura Y. Yamaguchi A. Yoshiki S. Matsuda T. Hirano T. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3297-3303PubMed Google Scholar, 13Passeri G. Girasole G. Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. Bone Miner. 1994; 24: 109-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, the production of TNF-α in pathological conditions such as estrogen deficiency and rheumatoid arthritis has been suggested to result in osteopenia and bone destruction adjacent to areas of inflammation (14Jilka R.L. Hangoc G. Girasole G. Passeri G. Williams D.C. Abrams J.S. Boyce B. Broxmeyer H. Manolagas S.C. Science. 1992; 257: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 15Vassalli P. Annu. Rev.

Invest. 1997; 99: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that TNF-α induces the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 through transcription factor NF-κB activation in osteoblasts, leading to the promotion of bone resorption (17Kurokouchi K. Kambe F. Yasukawa K. Izumi R. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Seo H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Kurokouchi K. Kambe F. Kikumori T. Sakai T. Sarkar D. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Seo H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The transcription factor NF-κB was first identified as a protein that binds to a specific DNA site in the intrinsic enhancer of the Igκ light chain gene. It is composed of homo- or heterodimers of members of the Rel family that control the expression of numerous genes involved in the immune and inflammatory responses, cell adhesion, and growth control. Moreover, NF-κB plays a role as a primary regulator of the stress response. NF-κB can be rapidly activated by many types of extracellular stimuli, including viral infection, bacterial products, oxidative stress, and physical stress (for reviews, see Refs. 19Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar, 20Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3445) Google Scholar, 21Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Additionally in endothelial cells, fluid flow alters activation of NF-κB resulting in changes in expression of cell adhesion molecules (22Khachigian L.M. Resnick N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 23Mohan S. Mohan N. Sprague E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C572-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mohan S. Mohan N. Valente A.J. Sprague E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1100-C1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that fluid flow-induced shear stress alters TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and expression of cell adhesion molecules in osteoblastic cells. To explore our hypothesis osteoblastic UMR106 cells were exposed to OFF in the presence or absence of TNF-α. Our results suggest that OFF inhibits TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. All reagents were obtained from Sigma except as otherwise noted. UMR106 cells were grown on glass slides in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Nearly confluent cells were incubated in minimal essential medium without fetal bovine serum for 24 h before experiments. OFF was generated as previously described with some modification (6Jacobs C.R. Yellowley C.E. Davis B.R. Zhou Z. Donahue H.J. J. Biomech. 1998; 31: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In brief, cells on glass slides were mounted in a parallel plate flow chamber attached to a custom designed fluid pump via rigid wall tubing. Cells were exposed to OFF, in the absence or presence of 1 ng/ml TNF-α, for various lengths of time at flow rates of 0, ±4, ±10, and ±20 ml/min at a frequency of 1 Hz. In our flow chamber, these flow rates induce peak shear stresses of 0, 1.9, 4.7, and 9.3 dyne/cm2, respectively. Cells were then harvested for nuclear and cytosolic protein extraction or total RNA extraction. Cells were subjected to OFF in the absence or presence of 1 ng/ml TNF-α at various flow rates for 2 h. After exposure to OFF, cells adhering to glass slides were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS (−); Life Technologies, Inc.) and were collected by trypsinization. Cell viability was evaluated by a trypan blue dye exclusion test. Nuclear and cytosolic protein extracts were prepared as described previously with some modification (17Kurokouchi K. Kambe F. Yasukawa K. Izumi R. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Seo H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). After being washed twice with 10 ml of PBS (−), the cells were incubated on ice for 5 min in 1 ml of PBS (−) containing 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), harvested by scraping with a cell scraper, and then pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 s at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer A (25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 10 μg of leupeptin, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 nm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsuflonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 5 μg/mlN-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chromethyl ketone, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40 (Fluka, Milwaukee, WI)) and lysed by incubating on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was used as cytosolic protein extract. The pellet was washed with PBS (−), resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer C (1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.4 m KCl, 100 nm pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsuflonyl fluoride), and lysed by freezing and thawing. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used as nuclear protein extract. Protein concentration was determined by a microassay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The nuclear and cytosolic protein extracts were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Nuclear extracts (20 μg of protein) were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide was obtained from Promega(Madison, WI). The NF-κB oligonucleotide was labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as a probe. To identify the NF-κB subunits, supershift analysis was performed using antibodies directed against p50 and p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The antibodies were added to the binding reaction mixture (40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 75 mm KCl, 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5 mmDTT, and 10% glycerol) before the addition of the labeled probe and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were loaded on 4% polyacrylamide gels (29:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) containing 45 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 3 h at 180 V. The gels were dried and autoradiographed to Kodak X-Omat AR films at room temperature. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 15 μg of total RNA, as determined by a spectrophotometer, was fractionated in 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels. The RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Gene Screen Plus; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by capillary action. The membrane was prehybridized in a solution containing 30% deionized formamide, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1% SDS, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 10 min at 55 °C. The heat-denatured probe for rat ICAM-1 cDNA was labeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The labeled cDNA probe was added to the solution, and the hybridization was performed for 20 h at 55 °C. After the hybridization, the membranes were washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 1% SDS twice for 5 min at 55 °C. Then the membranes were autoradiographed to films at −80 °C. The mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. Radioactivity of the band for the respective mRNA was quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The cytosolic extracts containing 60 μg of protein were mixed with 1 volume of SDS loading buffer containing 5% mercaptoethanol. After denaturing in boiling water for 10 min, the samples and molecular weight markers (Low or High; Bio-Rad) were fractionated on 10 or 6% SDS polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto membranes (Trans-Blot; Bio-Rad) using the Mini-Protean II system (Bio-Rad). The membranes were soaked for 30 min in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 3% skim milk. Then the membranes were incubated for 3 h with anti-IκBα, IκB kinase (IKK)α, or IKKβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:500 with TBST containing 3% skim milk. After washing three times with TBST, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:3000 with TBST containing 3% skim milk. After three additional washes with TBST, the membranes were soaked in enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membranes were then exposed to films. The cytosolic extracts containing 200 μg of protein were preincubated with 1 μg of IKKα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h and were then incubated for 20 h, together with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C. After washing 4 times with PBS (−), one-half of each of the immunocomplexes were subjected to IKK kinase assays. Kinase assays were performed as described previously with some modification (25Nasuhara Y. Adcock I.M. Catley M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19965-19972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, each immunoprecipitate was resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer (10 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm DTT, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsuflonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, and 0.5 mmNa3VO4) in the presence of 2.5 μg of IκBα (1–317; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a substrate at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 6× SDS loading buffer containing 30% mercaptoethanol. Samples and low molecular weight markers were fractionated on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and autoradiographed to film at room temperature. Radioactivity of the band for the respective IKK activity was quantified by PhosphorImager. To confirm the presence of IKK, the remaining one-half of each of the immunocomplexes was subjected to Western blot analysis using 1:500 dilutions of IKKα or IKKβ antibody. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance with a Bonferroni test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Trypan blue dye exclusion tests indicated that increasing flow rates up to ± 20 ml/min, inducing shear stresses up to 9.3 dyne/cm2, tended to decrease the number of viable cells adhering to glass slides (Fig. 1). However, over 90% of cells were viable after exposure to OFF, which was not significantly different from untreated controls. Moreover, TNF-α did not affect cell viability relative to cells untreated with TNF-α at any flow rates examined. Thus, under our study conditions TNF-α was not cytotoxic. We first examined the effect of OFF on NF-κB-DNA binding activity, in the absence or presence of TNF-α, by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear protein extracts obtained from UMR106 cells. A single weak NF-κB-DNA complex was observed even in untreated control cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Exposure to OFF in the absence of TNF-α did not change this basal activation of the NF-κB-DNA complex (lanes 2–4). In contrast, activation of two distinct complexes was observed in TNF-α treated cells, namely a fast-migrating complex, which exhibited the same mobility and weak activity as the complex observed in untreated cells, and an additional slow-migrating complex, which exhibited stronger activity (lane 5). Exposure to OFF decreased dramatically the TNF-α-induced activation of the slow-migrating NF-κB-DNA complex in a shear stress-dependent manner (lanes 6–8). However, the activity of the fast-migrating NF-κB-DNA complex was not altered by TNF-α or OFF. Time course studies (Fig. 2 B) revealed that treatment with TNF-α resulted in a rapid (within 15 min) increase of the slow-migrating NF-κB-DNA complex, which continued throughout the 120-min treatment period. Once again, TNF-α did not affect the activation of the fast-migrating NF-κB-DNA complex. In contrast, exposure to OFF decreased markedly the TNF-α-induced activation of the slow-migrating NF-κB-DNA complex in a time-dependent manner, whereas it did not change the activation of the fast-migrating NF-κB-DNA complex. We next characterized the NF-κB-DNA binding complexes in UMR106 cells utilizing supershift analysis with specific antibodies against p50 and p65, two of the more common members in the NF-κB/Rel family that form a dimer in rat osteoblastic cells (17Kurokouchi K. Kambe F. Yasukawa K. Izumi R. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Seo H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A weak single NF-κB-DNA complex in untreated cells (Fig. 2 C, lane 1) was supershifted by anti-p50 antibody (lane 2) but not by anti-p65 antibody (lane 3), indicating that the complex represents a p50 homodimer NF-κB. On the other hand, anti-p50 antibody supershifted both fast- and slow-migrating complexes induced by TNF-α (lane 5), whereas anti-p65 antibody supershifted only the slow-migrating complex (lane 6). Thus, the slow- and fast-migrating NF-κB-DNA complexes represent a p50-p65 heterodimer and a p50 homodimer NF-κB, respectively. ICAM-1 gene expression is mainly regulated by NF-κB in rat osteoblastic cells (17Kurokouchi K. Kambe F. Yasukawa K. Izumi R. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Seo H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Kurokouchi K. Kambe F. Kikumori T. Sakai T. Sarkar D. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Seo H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We therefore examined ICAM-1 mRNA expression to evaluate the effect of OFF on the expression of an endogenous NF-κB target gene. Basal ICAM-1 mRNA expression was detected even in the absence of TNF-α (Fig.3 A). This basal mRNA level was not altered by a 2-h exposure to OFF at any shear stress level examined. In contrast, treatment with TNF-α markedly increased ICAM-1 mRNA expression within 2 h. Exposure to OFF inhibited this TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression in a shear stress-dependent manner with the inhibition reaching statistical significance at 4.3 dynes/cm2. Time course studies (Fig. 3 B) revealed that TNF-α dramatically induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression during a 4-h exposure (lanes 1-5) while increasing the length of OFF exposure time decreased TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 mRNA levels (lanes 4–9). GAPDH mRNA levels were not altered by OFF regardless of the presence of TNF-α. To evaluate the mechanism by which OFF affects NF-κB activation, we examined protein levels of IκBα, which is the only endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB activation thus far identified. IκBα protein was highly expressed in the cytosol in the absence of TNF-α (Fig.4, upper panel, lane 1). Treatment with TNF-α markedly decreased IκBα protein levels within 60 min (lane 2), reflecting a degradation of IκBα. Exposure to OFF in the presence of TNF-α resulted in a substantial increase in IκBα protein levels in a shear stress-dependent manner (lanes 3–5). IκBα protein levels in cells exposed to TNF-α and OFF at 9.3 dynes/cm2 were similar to untreated control levels. These results suggest that OFF-induced shear stress decreases TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation. Protein levels of IKKα and IKKβ, two kinase members of the IKK family that regulate IκBα phosphorylation and thus degradation (21Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 26DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were not affected by exposure to TNF-α or OFF (Fig. 4, middle and lower panels, respectively). To evaluate the mechanism by which OFF decreases TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation, we examined the activities of endogenous IKK utilizing IκBα as a substrate in an in vitro kinase assay. The weak IKK activation observed in untreated cells (Fig.5 A, lane 1) dramatically increased after a 30-min exposure to TNF-α (lane 2). Exposure to OFF at 9.3 dyne/cm2 significantly inhibited this TNF-α-induced IKK activation (lane 3). OFF decreased the TNF-α-induced IKK activation in a shear stress-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). Time course studies revealed that TNF-α markedly increased IKK activation throughout the 60-min treatment period (Fig. 5 C, lanes 1–4). Additionally exposure to OFF decreased TNF-α-induced IKK activation to a greater degree with increasing exposure duration eventually reaching control levels by 60 min (lane 5-7).Middle and lower panels in Fig. 5 represent the protein levels of IKKα and IKKβ analyzed by Western blot analysis using a cytosolic immunocomplex precipitated by anti-IKKα antibody to confirm the presence of IKK. The immunoprecipitated protein levels of both IKKα and IKKβ did not change following exposure to TNF-α or OFF. The present study demonstrates for the first time that fluid flow has an inhibitory effect on NF-κB-DNA binding activity in the nucleus, especially on the activation of the slow-migrating NF-κB-DNA complex induced by TNF-α. The results of super shift analysis clearly indicate that the slow-migrating NF-κB-DNA complex activated by TNF-α is the p50-p65 heterodimer NF-κB and the basal NF-κB-DNA complex activated constitutively in UMR106 cells is the p50 homodimer NF-κB. TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression was also inhibited by OFF as shown by Northern blot analysis. The inhibitory effects of OFF on both TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 mRNA expression were shear stress-dependent and also increased with OFF exposure duration. These results suggest that OFF has a potent biophysical effect on mechanotransduction pathways, especially at the transcriptional level in osteoblastic cells stimulated by TNF-α. Theoretical models predict that the wall fluid shear stresses in the canaliculi of bone tissues are 6–30 dynes/cm2 (3Weinbaum S. Cowin S.C. Zeng Y.A. J. Biomech. 1994; 27: 339-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The maximum flow rate used for our study was ± 20 ml/min, and frequency was 1 Hz. This fluid flow induces peak shear stresses of 9.3 dyne/cm2 in our flow chamber. Thus, the fluid shear stress generated by our OFF system is within the range bone cells experiencein vivo. Under the condition of our studies, fluid flow had no effect on cell viability or adhesion. It has been demonstrated that the p50-p65 heterodimer NF-κB is capable of transactivating gene expression (29Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Indeed, we previously have shown that TNF-α induces interleukin-6 and ICAM-1 gene expressions in rat osteoblastic cells via activation of the p50-p65 heterodimer NF-κB (17Kurokouchi K. Kambe F. Yasukawa K. Izumi R. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Seo H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1290-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Kurokouchi K. Kambe F. Kikumori T. Sakai T. Sarkar D. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Seo H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The shear stress and time course for OFF inhibition of TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression were similar to the shear stress and time course for the inhibition of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Taken together with our previous findings, this suggests the possibility that the effect of OFF on TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 gene expression may be via an NF-κB-dependent pathway. However, a direct link between OFF, TNF-α, and ICAM-1 expression cannot be made without rigorous mutational analysis. In any case, our data clearly show an interaction of OFF with TNF-α that has a strong potential to alter bone cell activity. In this study, neither OFF nor TNF-α affected the basal p50 homodimer NF-κB activation. Moreover, basal ICAM-1 mRNA expression, which was detected in the absence of TNF-α, was not altered by OFF. It has been reported that moderate levels of p50 homodimer NF-κB activation was conserved in other cells (30Israel A. Le Bail O. Hatat D. Piette J. Kieran M. Logeat F. Wallach D. Fellous M.

The role for the p50 homodimer NF-κB activation in constitutive-type transcription is unclear, but it may provide low levels of transcriptional activity or it may serve as a transcriptional repressor protein (19Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar, 33Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In response to external stresses, mammalian cells rapidly translocate NF-κB to the nucleus. Once there, this protein binds to 10-base pair κB sites as a dimer within the DNA of specific genes, resulting in the regulation of transcription of these genes. The activity of NF-κB is tightly regulated by interactions with inhibitory IκB proteins in the cytoplasm, which block transport of NF-κB into the nucleus in the absence of activating signals. Most extracellular signals such as TNF-α activate NF-κB through a common pathway dependent on phosphorylation-induced degradation of IκB (for reviews, see Refs.19Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4596) Google Scholar, 20Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3445) Google Scholar, and 35Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5570) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that cytosolic IκBα protein levels were dramatically decreased by TNF-α and that OFF attenuated the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on IκBα. Recent evidence suggests that IκBα degradation is regulated by phosphorylation via IKK (36Yaron A. Gonen H. Alkalay I. Hatzubai A. Jung S. Beyth S. Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6486-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). IKK is a protein complex the catalysis of which is generally carried out by a heterodimeric kinase consisting of IKKα and IKKβ subunits (21Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 26DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Indeed, we observed IKKβ, as well as IKKα, by Western blot analysis using the immunocomplex precipitated by anti-IKKα antibody. This suggests that the IKK complex within the cytosol of UMR106 cells is largely a heterodimeric complex of IKKα and IKKβ. Both IKKα and IKKβ activities are stimulated in response to TNF-α or interleukin-1 (21Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 26DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Furthermore, knockout mice studies indicate that IKKα plays an important role in skeletal development (38Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined IKK kinase activity to evaluate the mechanism by which OFF affects TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation. Exposure to OFF inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of IKK in a shear stress-dependent manner. The shear stress-dependent pattern of OFF inhibition of TNF-α-induced IKK activation was similar to the shear stress-dependent pattern of the inhibition of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, ICAM-1 mRNA expression, and IκBα degradation, suggesting a link between these signaling pathways and OFF. Neither TNF-α nor OFF affected IKKα and IKKβ levels, suggesting that the effects we observed were not because of an effect on protein synthesis or degradation. Our results suggest that IKK is an initial target molecule for OFF effects on osteoblastic cells. OFF inhibits TNF-α-induced IKK activation, leading to a decrease in phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory IκBα, which in turn results in the decrease of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and the transcription of target genes. The precise mechanism by which OFF decreases TNF-α-induced IKK activity remains unclear. Recently it has been demonstrated that IKK itself is also phosphorylated and regulated by one or more upstream kinases (37Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). One possibility is that OFF affects dephosphorylation events by inducing conformational changes in these upstream kinases of IKK. Shear stress might lead directly to dephosphorylation by deforming kinases and inactivating them (39Gorbsky G.J. Ricketts W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1311-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that fluid flow rapidly activates mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, both recognized stress-activated protein kinases (40Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 41Li Y.S. Shyy J.Y. Li S. Lee J. Su B. Karin M. Chien S. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30455-30462Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) in vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, another possibility is that OFF might activate upstream kinases, leading to phosphorylation of IKK itself and resulting in decreased IKK activation. Indeed, more recently it was discovered that phosphorylation of IKKβ at C-terminal serines can also result in negative regulation of IKK activity by changing the conformation of the intrinsic kinase activator domain (46Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 47Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Another possibility is an indirect effect through which OFF-induced shear stress may modify distinct signaling factors that compete for or couple with TNF-α-induced IKK activation pathways. An important point to consider is that our results were obtained with UMR106 cells, a rat osteogenic osteosarcoma cell line with osteoblastic characteristics. Although this cell line has provided many important insights into bone cell biology, especially as related to mechanotransduction, it could be argued that transcription factors in UMR106 cells are not the same as those in authentic osteoblasts. However, we believe that this is unlikely, because it has recently been shown that NF-κB is required for TNF-α activity in primary culture human osteoblasts (48Yao G.-Q. Sun B.-H. Insogna K.L. Weir E.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2914-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In summary, our results suggest that OFF inhibits TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in an osteoblastic cell line. Previous studies suggest that TNF-α increases accumulation of bone resorption stimulating cytokines by osteoblastic cells (12Ishimi Y. Miyaura C. Jin C.H. Akatsu T. Abe E. Nakamura Y. Yamaguchi A. Yoshiki S. Matsuda T. Hirano T. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3297-3303PubMed Google Scholar, 13Passeri G. Girasole G. Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L.

Farmer P. Boden S. Kozlowski M. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3956-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) Thus, OFF may modulate bone turnover through its effect on bone cell activity.

What is not clear, however, is the role of the envelope (lipid bilayer and glycoproteins) in the stability of the viral particle. To address this question, we compared the stability between enveloped and nucleocapsid particles of thealphavirus Mayaro using hydrostatic pressure and urea. The effects were monitored by intrinsic fluorescence, light scattering, and binding of fluorescent dyes, including bis(8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate) and ethidium bromide. Pressure caused a drastic dissociation of the nucleocapsids as determined by tryptophan fluorescence, light scattering, and gel filtration chromatography. Pressure-induced dissociation of the nucleocapsids was poorly reversible. In contrast, when the envelope was present, pressure effects were much less marked and were highly reversible. Binding of ethidium bromide occurred when nucleocapsids were dissociated under pressure, indicating exposure of the nucleic acid, whereas enveloped particles underwent no changes. Overall, our results demonstrate that removal of the envelope with the glycoproteins leads the particle to a metastable state and, during infection, may serve as the trigger for disassembly and delivery of the genome. The envelope acts as a “Trojan horse,” gaining entry into the host cell to allow release of a metastable nucleocapsid prone to disassembly.

On one hand, the stability must be great enough to keep the particle intact while it is outside the host cell. On the other hand, the virus must be able to disassemble inside the infected cell. Among several steps in virus infection, disassembly of the capsid and unpacking of the nucleic acid is the least understood (1Rossmann M.G. Johnson J.E. Annu. Rev.

Here, the alphavirus Mayaro was used as a simple model of enveloped viruses to compare the properties of the whole and nucleocapsid particles deprived of the lipid bilayer and transmembrane glycoproteins. Mayaro virus is a member of the Alphavirus genus of the Togaviridae family. The single-stranded positive-sense RNA of alphaviruses is enclosed within a icosahedral core made up of 240 identical copies of the nucleocapsid protein (C) (12Paredes A.M. Simon M.L. Brown D.T. Virology. 1993; 187: 329-332Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A lipid-bilayer membrane derived from the infected host cell surrounds the nucleocapsid core (NC).1 Projecting from the bilayer and embedded in it are the viral-encoded glycoproteins designated E1 and E2 (also designated P1 and P2 in Mayaro virus) (13Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E2 is involved in cellular recognition and attachment, and E1 is involved in membrane fusion. A domain of the E2 protein also interacts with the NC inside of the lipid bilayer (13Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Helenius A.

Each trimer contains three E1-E2 heterodimers that appear intertwined but bulge in a triangular shape from the membrane. The high resolution x-ray structure of the purified capsid protein has shown that residues 114–264 have a structural fold similar to that of chymotrypsin (17Choi H.K. Tong L. Minor W. Dumas P.

In general, pressure maintains the secondary structure network but is unfavorable for hydrophobic interactions, which are predominantly responsible for maintaining the tertiary structure of a protein (20Silva J.L.

The negative volume change that occurs with protein dissociation or unfolding arises globally from more intimate interactions between the polypeptide chain and water. Thus pressure destabilizes hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in addition to eliminate cavities (20Silva J.L. Foguel D. Da Poian A.T. Prevelige P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Here, we characterize the metastable state of the ribonucleoprotein capsid by perturbing it with hydrostatic pressure or urea. The nucleocapsid dissociates into partially folded states under pressure that poorly reassemble into particles when pressure is returned to atmospheric values. In contrast, in the whole virus the envelope containing the lipid bilayer and the integral membrane proteins functions as a “thermodynamic cage,” preventing irreversible dissociation of the capsid and protecting the genome. All reagents were of analytical grade. Distilled water was filtered and deionized though a Millipore water purification system. The experiments were performed at 22 °C in the buffer 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) for Mayaro virus and Mayaro NC. Tris was chosen as the buffer because the dependence of its pK a on pressure is small. At 3.0 kbar, the value of pK a increases by only 0.1 unit (44Neuman R.C. Kauzmann W. Zipp A. J. Phys.

Bis(8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate) (Bis-ANS) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and ethidium bromide was purchased from Sigma. Baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were used extensively. Mayaro virus was grown on BHK-21 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 3% tryptose phosphate. Mayaro virus was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The virus was propagated for 48 h in 2.0-liter roller bottles that were placed on a roller apparatus in 37 °C warm room. To analyze Mayaro virus, biological activity before and after virus purification, infectivity assays were done. Virus dilutions were added to monolayers of BHK-21 cells in 60-mm-diameter Petri dishes. After 60 min at 37 °C, virus inoculum was removed, and the monolayers were overlaid with 2.0 ml of Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 1% of fetal bovine serum and 0.95% of agarose and incubated in an atmosphere of CO2 at 37 °C for 48 h. The monolayers were stained with crystal violet, and plaques were counted (45Volkmer N. Rebello M.A. IRCS Med. Sci. Biochem. 1981; 9: 157-158Google Scholar). Mayaro virus was purified as described previously with some modifications (46Rebello M.C.S. Fonseca M.E.F. Marinho J.O. Rebello M.A. Acta Virol. 1993; 37: 223-231PubMed Google Scholar). BHK-21 cells were infected with Mayaro virus at a low multiplicity of infection (0.1 plaque-forming unit/ml); 48 h post-infection, the supernatant was collected and sedimented at 8,000 rpm for 20 min to remove cells debris. After clarification, supernatant was spun in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor at 32,000 rpm for 1.5 h in a 30% sucrose cushion. The pellet was then resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) and layered onto a discontinuous 10–50% sucrose density gradient in 50 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl (pH 7.5) and spun for 1.5 h at 32,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-41 rotor. Fractions collected from the gradient were analyzed by reading the optical density at 280 and 260 nm. Purified virus was removed from sucrose gradient by dialysis in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) and maintained at 4 °C. Fresh preparations of whole virus were prepared for each set of experiments. Mayaro NC was purified as described previously for Sindbis virus (47Harrison S.C. Strong R.K. Schlesinger S. Schlesinger M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Purified NC fractions were collected and analyzed for their RNA content by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Purified virus NC was maintained at 4 °C. Fresh preparations of purified NC virus were prepared for each set of experiments. The high pressure bomb has been described (48Paladini A.A. Weber G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1981; 52: 419-427Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and was purchased from ISS Inc. (Champaign, IL). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a ISS200 or on ISSK2 computer-controlled spectrofluorometers (ISS Inc.). The spectra at pressure p were quantified by specifying the center of spectral mass (υ p) in wavenumber (cm−1) according to the following equation. 〈νp〉=∑νiFi/∑FiEquation 1 where F i stands for the fluorescence emitted at wavenumber υ i, and the summation is carried out over the range of appreciable values of F. Tryptophan emission was collected from 300 to 420 nm with excitation set at 280 nm. The binding of bis-ANS was monitored by exciting the samples at 360 nm and collecting the emission in the range of 400–600 nm (49Silva J.L. Peng L. Glaser M. Voss E.W. Weber G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of bis-ANS used in all experiments was 2 μm. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 15 min before making measurements. Light-scattering measurements were recorded on ISS 200 or on ISSK2 spectrofluorometers (ISS Inc.). Scattered light (320 nm) was collected at an angle of 90° of the incident light by integrating the intensity in the 315–325-nm window. High performance liquid chromatography was carried out in a Sephacryl G-500 column. The system was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris 0.5 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.5). A flow rate of 0.3 ml/min was utilized. Sample elution was monitored by fluorescence at 330 nm (excitation at 280 nm) and absorbance at 260 nm. Although much progress has been made on the understanding of viral structures in the last years, the thermodynamics and the mechanism of virus assembly and disassembly are still poorly understood. Hydrostatic pressure is an efficient tool for promoting dissociation of oligomeric proteins and for the studies of protein-nucleic acid interaction in virus assembly and stability (20Silva J.L. Foguel D. Da Poian A.T. Prevelige P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,25Mozhaev V.V. Heremans K. Frank J. Masson P. Balny C. Proteins. 1996; 24: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Because interactions between nucleic acids and proteins are mainly electrostatic, they are disfavored by high pressure. The effects of high pressure and urea on membrane-enveloped and isolated nucleocapsids of Mayaro virus were characterized by following the changes in intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the tryptophan (Trp) residues and in light scattering of the samples. Although the changes in light scattering indicate a decrease in the average size of the particles, the changes in fluorescence spectra reveal local modification in the environment of the Trp residues reflecting the tertiary structure. Therefore, fluorescence measurements are efficient means of monitoring the different states in the disassembly pathway of a virus particle. The changes in the Trp fluorescence were followed by the average energy of emission (expressed in wavenumbers) for whole particles (squares) and NC (circles) (Fig.1 A). The total change in center of spectral mass for virus particle was Δ = 350 cm−1 and, for NC, was Δ = 500 cm−1. These results suggest a greater Trp exposure to the polar solvent for the NC than for the whole virus particle. The changes in Trp emission were mostly reversible for the whole particle and irreversible for the NC. The changes in the whole particle are not only due to changes in the capsid protein but as well in the envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2). The inset shows the gel electrophoresis of purified samples of whole Mayaro virus and of nucleocapsids (Fig. 1 A), demonstrating that the NC preparation lacks the membrane spike proteins. The changes in light scattering as a function of pressure for the whole virus particle (square) and for NC (circles) are shown in Fig. 1 B. There was a slight decrease in the light scattering of the intact Mayaro virus solution, suggesting little dissociation of the viral particle. On the other hand, isolated nucleocapsids presented a dramatic decrease in the light scattering, suggesting its complete disassembly induced by high pressure. Theopen symbols on the left side of the panel represent the light-scattering values after decompression. As shown, the reassembly of nucleocapsids was not achieved after returning the samples to the atmospheric pressure. The small change in light scattering for enveloped particles occurred only in the first 500 bar, with practically no changes at higher pressures, which can be explained by the effects on a subpopulation of particles, very likely deformed or defective ones. To further characterize the stability induced by the envelope, urea was used as a perturbing agent. The changes in light scattering and in Trp fluorescence emission as a function of urea were monitored for the whole virus (Fig. 2, squares) and for the nucleocapsids (circles). The whole virus was more resistant to urea than the nucleocapsids, as measured by light scattering (Fig.2 A), Trp fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2 B), and the red shift of the Trp emission (Fig. 2 C). All these results demonstrate that the intact particles presented a higher stability against urea. The large red shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum of the nucleocapsid incubated in 8.0 m urea and at high pressure demonstrates the entire disassembly of these particles, clearly visualized in the spectra of Fig.3 A. In contrast, the structural changes promoted by pressure and urea on whole particles were not equivalent (Fig. 3 B). Thus, an end point is reached when urea or pressure perturbs the nucleocapsids, whereas only urea fully affects the enveloped particles. The dramatic decrease in light scattering (Fig. 1) indicates dissociation into subunits or small oligomers of the capsid protein. From the end point of the light-scattering curve we cannot assign the precise size of the dissociated units. To further characterize the products of dissociation of nucleocapsids, gel filtration chromatography was utilized (Fig. 4). It can be noticed that the peak that corresponds to the elution of nontreated NC particles (Fig. 4 A) decreased in the sample subjected to pressure (Fig. 4 B) with the appearance of dissociated protein at longer elution times. The elution time of the free protein corresponds to monomeric subunits of the capsid protein. A small peak also eluted at shorter times, indicating a fraction of aggregates of the capsid protein. More drastic effects were produced by treatment with 8.0 m urea (Fig. 4 C) that resulted in the elution of naked RNA (dashed line) without the protein. We have seen in many cases that unfolded capsid proteins become very sticky and adsorb into the column (8Da Poian A.T. Oliveira A.C. Silva J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2672-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Oliveira A.C. Gomes A.M.O. Almeida F.C.L. Mohana-Borges R. Valente A.P. Reddy V.S. Johnson J.E. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16037-16043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that the protein was in solution before injection in the column. Our data demonstrate that NC particles are dissociated into capsid proteins (probably monomers or small oligomers) and that only a small fraction of the protein reassembles into ribonucleoprotein particles after return to atmospheric pressure. To check whether NC dissociation was exposing the viral genome, ethidium bromide was utilized as a probe (Fig. 5). The whole virus particle (squares) was compared with nucleocapsid (circles). Whole viruses and nucleocapsids were incubated with 4 μm ethidium bromide and subjected to pressure (Fig. 5). Whole virus presented no changes in the binding of ethidium bromide, whereas NC showed a large increase in binding of the dye when pressure was increased up to 2.5 kbar. These results not only confirm that the nucleocapsid is dissociated by high pressure but also that RNA is exposed. The isolated symbols on the left side of thepanel represent the binding of ethidium bromide values after decompression. As shown, the RNA exposure is maintained after return to atmospheric pressure, suggesting that only a small fraction of ribonucleoprotein particles are formed after decompression. This result corroborates the gel filtration chromatography of pressurized NC (Fig.4 B), where it can be observed that there is a small quantity of protein and RNA eluting in the same position. The changes in ethidium bromide fluorescence (Fig. 5) occur at slightly lower pressures than the decrease in light scattering (Fig. 1). This result may indicate that RNA becomes accessible before dissociation, likely due to capsid expansion. To examine the protein conformation in the nucleocapsid and in the whole virus, we performed the pressurization of both samples in the presence of bis-ANS. The fluorescence emission of the probe incubated with the nucleocapsid at 2.5 kbar was almost twice the value of the control at atmospheric pressure (Fig.6 A). It is noteworthy that bis-ANS binding after decompression was even higher (four times the control). These results indicate that protein-RNA interactions are broken and result in binding of bis-ANS to the protein. Bis-ANS binds to pockets in native or partially folded proteins, especially to nucleic acid binding sites (32Silva J.L. Silveira C.F. Correa A. Pontes L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 50Rosen C.G. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). When whole virus was incubated with bis-ANS, an increase in fluorescence occurred especially because of binding to the membrane and to the membrane viral glycoproteins (49Silva J.L. Peng L. Glaser M. Voss E.W. Weber G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Korte T. Herrmann A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1994; 23: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 52Korte T.

Commun. 2000; 275: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The treatment of intact particles with pressure generated a different pattern from that found for NC particles. There was a large increase in fluorescence under pressure followed by a decrease when pressure was returned to 1.0 bar. These results corroborate the idea that the envelope glycoproteins suffered structural modifications induced by high pressure (Fig. 6 B); these changes resulted in loss of the ability to infect susceptible cells by the particles (49Silva J.L. Peng L. Glaser M. Voss E.W. Weber G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Jurkiewicz E. Villas-Boas M. Silva J.L. Weber G. Hunsmann G. Clegg R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6935-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). High concentrations of urea caused complete disruption of the particles and resulted in a remarkable decrease in bis-ANS binding for both whole virus and nucleocapsids, suggesting complete unfolding of the protein components. The pressure-dissociated NC protein bound bis-ANS and could bind even more after decompression. This result indicates that the capsid protein is in a partially folded state. In fact, the circular dichroism spectra of pressure-dissociated NC show retention of secondary structure (not shown). A fluctuating tertiary conformation is probably responsible for the heterogeneous elution profile in the gel filtration analysis with free, aggregated, and RNA-bound states. The combination of dynamic and structural data is required to dissect the steps of virus assembly and disassembly. Viruses propagate in host cells by conferring unique properties to each particle that act in a single sequential cycle: 1) assembly inside the cells and release to the environment; 2) attachment and fusion to new host cells; 3) disassembly and delivery of genome; 4) replication of the genome and transcription of new viral proteins. Step 2 is different for nonenveloped and enveloped viruses, and step 3 is not known in detail for most viruses (2Johnson J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here we show that removal of the envelope containing the lipid bilayer and the spike proteins (E1 and E2) results in a metastable NC particle. Under a given perturbation of the icosahedral structure, the “skinned” capsid dissociates into partially folded subunits with a substantial exposure of the RNA suitable for further processing."

Synthetic analogs of con-R were generated to evaluate the importance of the individual structural elements of this peptide in its NMDA receptor antagonist activity, measured by inhibition of the spermine-enhanced binding of the NMDA receptor-specific channel blocker, [3H]MK-801, to rat brain membranes. Progressive C-terminal truncations of the 27-residue peptide revealed stages of severe activity loss. These occurred at con-R[1–11] and con-R[1–7], corresponding to the deletions of Leu12–Pro27 and Met8–Pro27 respectively. A second set of analogs featured single Ala substitutions in the fully active con-R[1–17] fragment. The replacement of Met8 and Leu12 by Ala resulted in approximate 20- and 55-fold decreases of inhibitor potency, respectively. In addition to these two residues, the only other positions where a single Ala substitution led to substantial losses (from 11-fold to >1000-fold) of activity were those of the first five N-terminal amino acids. Based on the above findings, the binding epitope of con-R was localized to the N-terminal turn of the helix and other residues on one face along two subsequent turns. This contribution pattern of the side chains in activity closely resembles the results obtained with another member of this peptide family, conantokin-T. The secondary structure and metal ion binding properties of the con-R variants were also evaluated using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Divalent cation-dependent increases of α-helix content were observed in most analogs. However, analogs with replacement of Gla11 and Gla15, as well as truncation fragments shorter than 15 residues, lost the ability to be stabilized by metal ions. These results confirmed the location of the primary divalent cation binding locus at Gla11 and Gla15.

Stafford D.W. Olivera B.M. Bandyopadhyay P.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cloning of the cDNA for con-G allowed examination of the sequence requirements of the Conus-derived carboxylase, which showed substantial differences between the carboxylation signal sequence specificities of mammalian and Conus carboxylases, despite the similar cofactor requirements (18Bandyopadhyay P.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5447-5450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). con-R contains 27 amino acids, exceeding by 10 and 6 residues the sizes of con-G and con-T, respectively. Other features that distinguish this peptide from con-G and con-T include a single amino acid insertion at Ala10 and a five-member disulfide loop near the C terminus. con-R also possesses a free α-carboxylate at its C terminus, unlike con-G and con-T, both of which feature amidated C termini. Several amino acids are rigidly conserved among the conantokins. These include the N-terminal Gly-Glu sequence, four Gla residues, and an Arg residue preceding the Gla closest to the C terminus of the peptides. In addition, Lys7, Met8, Leu12, and Lys19 are present in both con-R and con-T. It is also relevant that a recently obtained clone of the con-G cDNA coded for Val5, which is the same residue as in con-R (18Bandyopadhyay P.K. Colledge C.J. Walker C.S. Zhou L.M. Hillyard D.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5447-5450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to the occurrence of the post-translationally modified Gla, an additional remarkable structural feature of the conantokins is their stable end-to-end α-helical secondary structure (19Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Skjaerbaek N. Nielsen K.J. Lewis R.J. Alewood P. Craik D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In con-G, the α-helical conformation is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions (22Blandl T. Zajicek J. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Chen Z.G. Blandl T. Prorok M. Warder S.E. Li L.P. Zhu Y. Pedersen L.G. Ni F. Castellino F.J. J.

Castellino F.J. Ni F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The primary metal ion binding site has been localized to Gla10 and Gla14 in both con-G and con-T (23Chen Z.G. Blandl T. Prorok M. Warder S.E. Li L.P. Zhu Y. Pedersen L.G. Ni F. Castellino F.J. J.

Peptide Res. 1999; 53: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Metal ion chelation by these residues leads to a strong stabilization of the α-helical fold. The examination of the secondary structure and cation binding properties of con-R revealed that residues 1–20 form a moderately stable α-helix, whereas the C-terminal disulfide loop segment is in a nonhelical conformation (27Blandl T. Warder S.E. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Additionally, full metal ion binding capacity of this peptide was retained by a 17-residue N-terminal fragment (27Blandl T. Warder S.E. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The common receptor target of these peptides is the NMDAR (3Haack J.A. Rivier J. Parks T.N. Mena E.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M.

In this communication, a similar analysis of con-R is reported. Chemical modifications were utilized to evaluate the functional importance of structural elements in con-R. Several functionally important residues were identified, and this information was compared with the results that are available on the other two peptides. Syntheses of con-R (NH2-GEγγV5AKMAA10γLARγ15NIAKG20CKVNC25YP-COOH) and its analogs were performed by automated solid phase peptide synthesis on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 433A peptide synthesizer (19Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Fmoc protection strategy was used with the following side chain protecting groups: tert-butyl ester for Gla, Glu, Tyr; trityl for Asn, Cys; 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-chroman-6-sulfonyl for Arg; and butyloxycarbonyl for Lys. The derivatized Gla was synthesized as described previously (36Colpitts T.L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). con-R, containing a C-terminal free acid, was synthesized on a preloaded H-Pro-2-chlorotrityl resin support (NovaBiochem, San Diego, CA), as described (27Blandl T. Warder S.E. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All of the truncated variants were synthesized as the peptide amides, using 5-(4-Fmoc-aminomethyl-3,5-dimethoxyphenoxy)-valeric acid-p-methylbenzylhydrylamine resin support (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Peptides were cleaved with 88% trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of the radical scavengers dithiothreitol and triisopropylsilane. Peptide purification was typically achieved by anion exchange chromatography on an fast protein liquid chromatography Bioscale DEAE20 (Bio-Rad) column, followed by desalting on a Sephadex G-15 column (1.5 × 100 cm) that was equilibrated and eluted with 0.1% NH4OH. The peptides were characterized by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, as described (19Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Concentrations of peptide stock solutions were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed by decapitation, and forebrains were removed and processed (31Skolnick P. Boje K. Miller R. Pennington M. Maccecchini M.-L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1516-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Inhibition assays were performed in triplicate in a total volume of 500 μl in 5 mm Na-Hepes, 4.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, in the nominal absence of glutamate and glycine, with varying concentrations of peptide (25Warder S.E. Prorok M. Chen Z.G. Li L.P. Zhu Y. Pedersen L.G. Ni F. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7512-7522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The final concentrations of [3H]MK-801 and spermine were 5 nm and 50 μm, respectively. Binding was initiated by the addition of 300 μl of membrane suspension, containing 100–200 μg of protein. Incubations were carried out for 2 h at room temperature. The assays were terminated by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/B filters pretreated with 0.03% polyethyleneimine, using a 24-well cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). Basal [3H]MK-801 binding was defined as the amount of radioligand bound in the nominal absence of spermine. Observed enhancements in [3H]MK-801 binding at 50 μm spermine were 60–300% over basal values, depending on the membrane preparation. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 50 μm MK-801 and represented 5–10% of total ligand bound in the presence of 50 μm spermine. Two age groups of mice were injected with peptide or buffer intracranially as previously described (19Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mice (10-days and 30-days of age; n = 4) received 30 μl each of 150 μm or 450 μm peptide solution, respectively, in sterile saline (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Ca2Cl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.40). Behavioral observations were made in a blinded fashion for 8 h post-injection and at 24 h post-injection. con-T solutions at the same concentrations were used as positive controls. CD spectra of con-R analogs were collected at 25 °C in 10 mm sodium borate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, on an Aviv (Lakewood, NJ) model 200SF spectrometer using a 1-cm-pathlength cell. The peptide solutions and buffers used were treated with Chelex-100 resin prior to the experiments to ensure that they contained no multivalent metal ions. CD spectra of the peptides were acquired in 100% aqueous buffer with the above composition or with the addition of 20 mmCaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, or 1.5 mm ZnCl2. The peptide concentration was 35 μm. The α-helical content was determined from mean residue ellipticities at 222 nm using the empirical relationship,fα = (−[Θ]222-2340)/30,300 (37Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). Peptide samples (∼2 mm) were dissolved in a solution containing 10 mm sodium borate, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5, 10%2H2O. Two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (spin-lock interval, 60 ms) and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (mixing time, 150 ms) spectra were recorded at 5 °C at a spectral window of 6200 Hz on a three channel Varian UnityPlus spectrometer (599.89 MHz, 1H) employing standard pulse sequences (38Griesinger C. Otting G. Wuthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 39Bodenhausen G. Kogler H. Ernst R.R. J. Mag. Reson. 1988; 58: 370-388Google Scholar) using the hypercomplex phase sensitive method (39Bodenhausen G. Kogler H. Ernst R.R. J. Mag. Reson. 1988; 58: 370-388Google Scholar). The H2O signal was suppressed by presaturation. Relaxation delays of 1.6 and 2.8 s (including presaturation) were used in the total correlation spectroscopy and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy experiments, respectively. Time domain data (t 2 andt 1) were recorded as 2048 × 256 complex matrices with 16 and 56 scans per t 1 increment for the total correlation spectroscopy and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy spectra, respectively. Linear prediction to the 512 complex data points was applied to the fids in the t 1 domain, and zero filling in botht 2 and t 1 domains was used (40States D.I. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Mag. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-293Google Scholar). Final 4K × 2K complex time domain data sets were Fourier transformed with Gaussian apodization functions applied in both dimensions. A first order base-line correction was applied in F2 domain. All spectra were processed identically using Varian software that accompanied the spectrometer. The spectra were referenced relative to the signal of DSS (δ = 0 ppm). The binding isotherms of Mg2+ to the con-R variants were determined by measurements of the heat changes accompanying titration of the metal ions into solutions of the relevant sample. The titrations were performed with an OMEGA titration calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northhampton, MA) at 25 °C in a buffer containing 10 mmNa-Mes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.5. The exact protocols used as well as the methods for data analyses have been published previously. To elucidate the detailed structure-activity relationships in the con-R sequence, a number of analogs were synthesized. Progressive C-terminal truncations were introduced in a series of variants. In addition, in a second set of con-R variants, individual side chain residues were replaced with Ala. Members of this latter group were 17 amino acids in length, based on the fully active con-R[1–17] sequence. The NMDAR antagonist activity of each analog was determined by the [3H]MK-801 binding assay (Fig.1) and compared with the potency of wild-type con-R. The results with the C-terminal truncation series are shown in TableI. The potencies of con-R[1–20], con-R[1–17], and con-R[1–15] are comparable with the full-length peptide. Truncations through residues resulted in potency decreases of less than 1 order of magnitude. Sequences between con-R[1–11] and con-R[1–8] suffered substantial (120–150-fold) decreases of activity. con-R[1–7] and con-R[1–6] displayed IC50 values that were >100 μm, which represented a diminution of potency of at least 1000-fold.Table IEffects of C-terminal truncations on the NMDAR antagonist and conformational properties of con-RPeptideIC50 1-aValues represent the peptide concentration needed to achieve 50% inhibition of the spermine-induced potentiation of [3H]MK-801 binding to rat brain membranes.α-Helix 1-bSecondary structure content of con-G analog in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. α-Helicity values were determined by CD measurements.apoCa2+Mg2+μm%con-R 1-cPublished in Ref. 27.0.093192934con-R[1–20] 1-cPublished in Ref. 27.0.12345568con-R[1–17] 1-cPublished in Ref. 27.0.090234058con-R[1–15]0.073273356con-R[1–14]0.13453331con-R[1–13]0.63261518con-R[1–12]0.8317610con-R[1–11]121245con-R[1–9]141444con-R[1–8]131286con-R[1–7]>100821con-R[1–6]>1000001-a Values represent the peptide concentration needed to achieve 50% inhibition of the spermine-induced potentiation of [3H]MK-801 binding to rat brain membranes.1-b Secondary structure content of con-G analog in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. α-Helicity values were determined by CD measurements.1-c Published in Ref. 27Blandl T.

Open table in a new tab The data obtained from substitutions of Ala at individual side chains are summarized in Table II. These analogs were generated as 17-amino acid N-terminal fragments, because con-R[1–17] displayed the same potency as full-length con-R. Alterations to any of the N-terminal four amino acids decreased the potency of the peptides. These same residues were similarly important to the activities of con-G (34Blandl T. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Glu2 and Gla4are required for activity, because their removal results in a minimum of a 1000-fold decrease in peptide potency. Ala substitutions of Gly1 and Gla3 reduced activity by 11- and 160-fold, respectively. Three additional analogs, con-R17[V5A], con-R17[M8A], and con-R17[L12A] displayed 20–60-fold reductions in activity. Alterations at Lys7 and Arg14 did not result in significant effects on activity. The simultaneous replacement of Gla11 and Gla15 had a small adverse effect,viz. a 9- or 4-fold potency decrease for the double-Ala or double-Glu analog, respectively. The sequence positions of these residues were altered by deleting Ala10 of con-R[1–17] in con-R16[ΔA10]. This shifted the tight metal ion site at Gla11 and Gla15 to identical locations of these residues because they are found in con-G and con-T (Gla10 and Gla14). The potency of this analog decreased by 28-fold.Table IIEffects of the side chains on the NMDAR antagonist and conformational properties of con-RPeptideIC50 2-bValues represent the peptide concentration needed to achieve 50% inhibition of the spermine potentiation of [3H]MK-801 binding to rat brain membranes.α-Helix 2-aSecondary structure content of con-G analog in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. α-Helicity values were determined by CD measurements.apoCa2+Mg2+μm%con-R 2-cPublished in Ref. 27.0.093192934con-R[1–17] 2-cPublished in Ref. 27.0.090234058con-R17[G1A]0.88223546con-R17[E2A]>100324760con-R17[Gla3A]19395966con-R17[Gla4A]≫100102735con-R17[V5A]5.4223452con-R17[K7A]0.12143448con-R17[M8A]5.1273362con-R17[L12A]1.9223452con-R17[R14A]0.090122439con-R17[Gla11,15A]0.83554342con-R17[Gla11,15E]0.35352125con-R16[ΔA10]2.61842562-a Secondary structure content of con-G analog in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. α-Helicity values were determined by CD measurements.2-b Values represent the peptide concentration needed to achieve 50% inhibition of the spermine potentiation of [3H]MK-801 binding to rat brain membranes.2-c Published in Ref. 27Blandl T.

Open table in a new tab The in vivo effects of con-R variations were also tested by intracranial injections of mice with peptide solutions. The 15-μg dose of full-length con-R used for the 10-day of age group resulted in a sleep-like inactive state within 15 min post-injection, which lasted 6–8 h. Similar effects were seen with the positive control group, which was injected with the same concentration of con-T. To a second, 30-day of age group, a quantity of 45 μg of con-R was administered. These mice also exhibited a sleep-like condition for 2–6 h, but unlike the age 10-day group, these animals awakened periodically and showed considerable disorientation, impaired movement, e.g., dragging hind legs, and vocalized repeatedly. At 6–8 h post-injection, members of this group showed some signs of hyperactivity, such as constant walking and cage climbing. The 30-day-old positive control group injected with con-T underwent a shorter inactive sleep period (<1 h) and exhibited disoriented/hyperactive behavior 2–8 h after injection. Animals from both age groups appeared normal in behavior after 24 h. The mouse intracranial injection experiments were also performed with con-R[1–17]. The 10-day-old mice receiving the same dose of con-R[1–17] as wild-type con-R and con-T slept for 2.5–4 h, a significantly shorter period than the 6–8 h observed for the other two peptides. The 30-day-old animals exhibited an impaired state for up to 2 h, after which normal activity was resumed, with no signs of disorientation or hyperactivity. Again, in this case, although similar syndromes were observed as in the groups receiving an equivalent dose of con-R or con-T, the duration of the effects was shorter. The in vivo results with con-R17 were compared with point variants of this peptide. Three peptides were chosen, viz.con-R17[E2A], con-R17[K7A], and con-R17[M8A]. con-R17[E2A], which did not display NMDAR activity in the MK-801 binding assay (Table I), also did not show any in vivo activity after intracranial injections in mice. Similarly, con-R17[K7A], which showed full potency in the in vitro MK-801 binding assay, induced a sleep-like state, similar to wild-type con-R[1–17] in the in vivo mouse assay. Lastly, con-R17[M8A], which showed an approximate 50-fold reduction in activity compared with con-R[1–17] in the MK-801 binding assay, displayed a qualitatively intermediate effect in the mouse in vivo assay. This variant induced a very sluggish behavioral state in mice, but sleep did not occur. The overall conformation of each analog was examined by CD spectroscopy in the absence of multivalent cations and in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+, respectively. These secondary structure observations revealed that con-R-derived peptides of 15 amino acids or longer displayed the cation-dependent increase of α-helical character. Truncation analogs shorter than this length had progressively less α-helical content in the apo-form and a slight decrease of α-helicity upon loading with high concentrations of either Ca2+ or Mg2+. Fig.2 illustrates the CD spectra of con-R[1–15] and con-R[1–14], in both the absence of metal ions and in the presence of Mg2+. The above described differences in cation-dependent conformational transitions are clearly observed in these two analogs. Additionally, the α-helicity of the apo-peptide is higher for the shorter analog. This can be explained by the deletion of Gla15 and, therefore, the elimination of charge repulsion between Gla11 and Gla15 in the absence of complex forming cations. In the Ala replacement series, some peptides showed altered conformational properties. Analogs of Gla4, Lys7, and Arg14 had lowe"

Because AGT is expressed in renal proximal tubule cells, we hypothesized that its loss may be the primary mediator of the lethal phenotype. We generated two models to test this hypothesis by breeding transgenic mice expressing human renin with mice expressing human AGT (hAGT) either systemically or kidney-specifically. We then bred double transgenic mice with AGT+/− mice, intercrossed the compound heterozygotes, and examined the offspring. We previously reported that the presence of the human renin and systemically expressed hAGT transgene complemented the lethality observed in AGT−/− mice. On the contrary, we show herein that the presence of the human renin and kidney-specific hAGT transgene cannot rescue lethality in AGT−/− mice. An analysis of newborns indicated that AGT−/− mice were born in normal numbers, and collection of dead 10-day old pups revealed an enrichment in AGT−/−. Importantly, we demonstrated that angiotensinogen protein and functional angiotensin II was generated in the kidney, and the kidney-specific transgene was temporally expressed during renal development similar to the endogenous AGT gene. These data strongly support the notion that the loss of systemic AGT, but not intrarenal AGT, is responsible for death in the AGT−/− mouse model. Taken together with our previous studies, we conclude that the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system located in the proximal tubule plays an important role in blood pressure regulation and may cause hypertension if overexpressed, but may not be required for continued development of the kidney after birth.

All the components of the RAS are detectable at the mRNA and protein level in the developing kidney. Angiotensinogen can be detected as early as embryonic day 17 (E17) in rodent kidney where it is expressed primarily in developing tubules (1Gomez R.A. Norwood V.F. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 26: 409-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Renal angiotensinogen expression peaks around birth but declines thereafter (2Darby I.A. Sernia C. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 281: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Renin can be found in rodents as early as E15 before obvious blood vessel and nephron formation occurs, and at E17 is expressed in the renal artery and its main branches. Its expression pattern gradually moves from vascular structures to mature juxtaglomerular cells as kidney development progresses (1Gomez R.A. Norwood V.F. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 26: 409-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Gomez R.A. Kidney Int. 1998; 67: S12-S16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Similar to angiotensinogen, renin expression reaches a peak around birth (4Gomez R.A. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1990; 4: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the rat kidney, ACE can be detected at E16, and AT-1 and AT-2 receptors are expressed throughout metanephric development (5Jung F.F. Bouyounes B. Barrio R. Tang S.S. Diamant D. Ingelfinger J.R. Pediatr. Nephrol. 1993; 7: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Tufro-McReddie A. Harrison J.K. Everett A.D. Gomez R.A. J. Clin.

Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 140-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Consequently, all the components of the RAS are expressed during early kidney development in specific temporal-spatial patterns associated with nephrogenesis, suggesting the RAS may play an important role during renal development. There is ample evidence showing that Ang-II has trophic or mitogenic effects on a variety of target cells and tissues in addition to its function as a regulator of volume and sodium homeostasis. Ang-II directly stimulates growth and proliferation of renal mesangial cells, proximal tubular cells, Henle's loop cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro (8Anderson P.W. Do Y.S. Hsueh W.A. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Dubey R.K. Roy A. Overbeck H.W. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Wolf G. Neilson E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F768-F777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); Ang-II may also stimulate a cascade involving growth factors and oncogenes such as transforming growth factor β, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, c-Fos, c-Myc, and c-Jun (11Wolf G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 377: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Direct evidence implicating an important role of the RAS in renal development comes from studies using either pharmacological blockade or targeted disruption of the RAS. ACE inhibitor treatment during pregnancy (even during pre-eclampsia) is strongly contraindicated, because their infants have an increased incidence of renal tubular dysplasia, growth retardation, oligohydramnios, hypotension, hypocalvaria, and death (12Barr M.J. Teratology. 1994; 50: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Similarly, neonatal rats treated with captopril, enalapril, and losartan exhibit gross histopathologic changes in the kidney, including tubular atrophy and dilation, papillary atrophy, interstitial inflammation, and hyperplasia of renal vasculature (13Friberg P. Sundelin B. Bohman S.O. Bobik A. Nilson H. Wickman A. Gustafsson H. Petersen J. Adams M.A. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 485-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice with targeted mutations in the angiotensinogen, ACE, AT-1 receptor genes, and in both renin genes, have nearly identical phenotypes characterized by poor survival to weaning, low blood pressure, and abnormal kidney structure. Their kidneys develop thickened, hypercellular arterial walls, interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, papillary atrophy, and tubular dilation (14Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R.

Given the severity of the renal lesions, it has been hypothesized, but not proven, that the lethality is related to renal failure. We previously reported that transferring both the human renin (hREN) and human angiotensinogen (hAGT) genes onto the mouse angiotensinogen (mAGT) knockout background complemented (rescued) the lethality and renal lesions associated with the loss of angiotensinogen (18Davisson R.L. Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Lager D.J. Smithies O. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the hAGT transgene used in that study was driven by its own endogenous promoter and expressed in multiple tissues such as liver, kidney, brain, and heart. Therefore, it is unclear whether restoration of the systemic RAS or intrarenal RAS was responsible for the rescue. Given that the primary defect in AGT-deficient mice may be the kidney, the aim of this study was to determine whether the intrarenal RAS plays a critical role in renal development by determining if restoring only the intrarenal RAS can rescue the lethal phenotype in mAGT-deficient mice. The results of this classic genetic complementation assay are reported herein. The generation and characterization of hREN, hAGT, and KAP-hAGT single and double transgenic mice have been reported previously (19Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Carney C. Schlager G. Robillard J.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28142-28148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The KAP-hAGT transgene segregates as an autosomal trait and is kidney-specifically expressed, whereas the hREN transgene is X-chromosome-linked and systemically expressed. The generation of mAGT-deficient mice has been described previously (14Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B. Best C.F. Jennette J.C. Coffman T.M. Maeda N. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2735-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). All mice were maintained by backcross breeding to C57BL/6J, and were fed standard mouse chow (Teklad LM-485) and water ad libitum unless otherwise indicated. Care of mice met or exceeded the standards set forth by the National Institutes of Health in the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. All procedures were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were killed by CO2asphyxiation. For the developmental study, KAP-hAGT single transgenic male mice were crossed with female C57BL/6J, and pregnancy was monitored by daily examination of vaginal plugs. Mouse fetuses were removed on E7.5 through E18.5. In addition, newborn through 8-week-old mice were also collected. For the genetic complementation study, hREN/KAP-hAGT double transgenic females were mated to male mice heterozygous for the mAGT deletion (+/−) and the compound heterozygotes hREN/KAP-hAGT mAGT+/− were intercrossed. The resulting offspring immediately after birth and at 10 days and 3 weeks of age were collected. In addition, all cages were carefully monitored for dead pups, which were immediately taken for sampling and genotyping. Genomic DNA was isolated from tail or placental biopsies as described previously (20Davisson R.L. Ding Y. Stec D.E. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PCR analysis was performed to identify the hREN, hAGT, and KAP-hAGT transgenes using specific primer sets as reported (22Sigmund C.D. Jones C.A. Kane C.M. Wu C. Lang J.A. Gross K.W. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 23Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To genotype the mAGT locus, different PCR primer sets were used: Primer a, 5′-GTATACATCCACCCCTTCCA-3′; primer b, 5′-GGAAGTGAACGTAGGTGTTGAA-3′; primer c, 5′-TGCACGGGTTCTGAGGATCCA-3′; and primer d, 5′-TAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGACT-3′. The set of primers a and b is specific to the wild-type mAGT locus and yields a 750-bp fragment, whereas primers c and d are specific to the targeted mAGT locus yielding a 1.3-kb fragment. Southern blot analysis was carried out to confirm the PCR results as previously described (18Davisson R.L. Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Lager D.J. Smithies O. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, tail DNA was digested with XbaI, separated on 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and hybridized with a probe specific for intron 1 and part of exon 2 of the mAGT gene. After hybridization, the wild-type mAGT locus yields a 5-kb fragment, whereas the targeted locus yields a 6.5-kb fragment. The sex of fetuses and newborns was determined by PCR amplification of an srygene fragment as described previously (24Yang G. Sigmund C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F932-F939PubMed Google Scholar). RNase protection assay was used to compare the time course of expression of hAGT transgene with that of the endogenous mAGT gene during development. The hAGT probe was derived from exon 2 at nucleotides 302–819 relative to the transcription start site as described previously (21Ding Y. Davisson R.L. Hardy D.O. Zhu L.-J. Merrill D.C. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28142-28148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The mAGT probe was derived by cloning a reverse transcriptase-PCR product from nucleotides 305–739. The oligonucleotides used to clone the mAGT cDNA probe were 5′-GCCGCCGAGAAGCTAGAGGATGAG-3′ and 5′-TGGGAAGAGGGCAGGGGTAAAGAG-3′. This cDNA fragment was first cloned to pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into pBluescript SK− to obtain the desired antisense orientation relative to the T7 promoter. The mouse β-actin cDNA (mAct) probe was provided by Ambion (Austin, TX). Antisense RNA probe was prepared using an in vitro transcription reaction containing [α-32P]UTP. Total RNA was isolated from whole fetuses from E7.5 to E13.5, and kidneys from E16.5 to 8-week-old mice as described previously (22Sigmund C.D. Jones C.A. Kane C.M. Wu C. Lang J.A. Gross K.W. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 1070-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Total tissue RNA (20 μg) was hybridized to the probes and were treated according to the manufacturer's protocol for Hyb-Speed RNase protection assay kit (Ambion). The length of the full-length probe for hAGT, mAGT, and mAct are 630, 591, and 330 nucleotides, respectively, and the expected protected fragment are 518, 425, and 250 nucleotides, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and measurements of urinary hAGT and blood pressure were described in detail previously (20Davisson R.L. Ding Y. Stec D.E. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Ding Y. Davisson R.L. Hardy D.O. Zhu L.-J. Merrill D.C. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28142-28148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Chi-square analysis was performed to compare the genotype frequencies with expected Mendelian ratios using the SigmaStat software package. The purpose of this study is to genetically determine whether the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system alone can rescue the postnatal lethality observed in mAGT knockout mice. To accomplish this, we performed a complementation assay employing one transgenic mouse expressing hREN and two transgenic models expressing hAGT—one expressing hAGT systemically (hAGT or A+) and one expressing hAGT specifically in proximal tubule cells of the kidney (KAP-hAGT or KA+). In the systemic model, hAGT mRNA is abundant in the liver, kidney, heart, and brain, and elevated levels of hAGT protein are present in the systemic circulation (23Yang G. Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32497-32502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double transgenic mice expressing both hREN and the systemic hAGT transgene exhibit a 4-fold elevation in plasma Ang-II and are chronically hypertensive (19Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Carney C. Schlager G. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the KAP-hAGT mice, hAGT mRNA and protein are restricted to the kidney as a consequence of being driven by the kidney-specific KAP promoter (20Davisson R.L. Ding Y. Stec D.E. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Double transgenic mice containing both the hREN andKAP-hAGT genes do not have circulating hAGT protein, have normal plasma Ang-II levels, but are nevertheless hypertensive (20Davisson R.L. Ding Y. Stec D.E. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To perform the genetic analysis we first bred hREN mice with either hAGT or KAP-hAGT mice to generate systemic (R+/A+) and kidney-specific (R+/KA+) double transgenic mice (Fig. 1). Double transgenic females were then bred with male mice heterozygous for the mAGT deletion (+/−), and the compound heterozygotes (R+/A+ mAGT+/− or R+/KA+ mAGT+/−) were identified. These compound heterozygotes were then intercrossed, and the resulting offspring were genotyped by PCR and Southern blot analysis (Fig.2). According to Mendelian genetics, the offspring would exhibit one of 12 different genotypes with different combinations of R+, A+, or KA+ transgenes and mAGT alleles (TableI). Our previous data indicated that single transgenic mice (R+/A− or R−/A+) have the same level of plasma renin activity, plasma Ang-II, and blood pressure as normal mice (R−/A−) and therefore can be stratified together as a single group (18Davisson R.L. Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Lager D.J. Smithies O. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Merrill D.C. Thompson M.W. Carney C. Schlager G. Robillard J.E. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This is because the enzymatic reaction between renin and angiotensinogen is species-specific, such that human renin cannot cleave mouse angiotensinogen and vice versa (25Hatae T. Takimoto E. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, Ang-I generated from the enzymatic reaction between human renin and human angiotensinogen can be cleaved to form Ang-II by mouse ACE, because Ang-I is evolutionary conserved in rodents and humans. Therefore, we stratified offspring from the third round of breeding into a double transgenic group (RA+ or RKA+), and a nondouble transgenic group (RA− or RKA−). The nondouble transgenic group consisted of mice that were either nontransgenic, single transgenic, but not doubly transgenic. This simplified the 12 original genotypes into 6 relevant genotypes (mAGT+/+, mAGT+/−, and mAGT−/− for each).Figure 2Sample genotype data.

Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Lager D.J. Smithies O. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the absence of lethality, we expect 25% of offspring to be mAGT−/−. Only three of the nondouble transgenic mice that inherited both targeted alleles of mAGT survived to weaning. However, all double transgenic mice inheriting both targeted alleles of mAGT survived to weaning, demonstrating that systemic expression of hREN and hAGT can complement the lethality observed in AGT−/− mice. In fact, all R+/A+ mAGT−/− mice survived to at least 6 months of age, and the kidneys appeared histologically normal. The mice also exhibited slightly elevated blood pressure. Although we did not repeat this test breeding, we have since generated a fully homozygous inbred strain of R+/A+ mAGT−/− (R+/+A+/+mAGT−/−) mice, which we have been able to continuously maintain for the past 2 years. We genotyped 128 offspring 3 weeks of age from the R+/KA+ mAGT+/− intercross (Table I) and then stratified the data into a nondouble transgenic and a double transgenic group (TableII). As evident from these data, no RKA− mAGT−/− or RKA+ mAGT−/− mice survived to 3 weeks of age. χ2 analysis showed a highly significant difference between the numbers of mice observed and those expected based only on Mendelian inheritance assuming no lethal effects of the mAGT deficiency (p < 0.0001). To determine whether the mAGT−/− mice were born at the appropriate ratio (25%) or died in utero, we performed a second set of breeding between R+/KA+ mAGT+/− parents and collected newborns from 27 litters. Genotype analysis of 159 offspring revealed appropriate proportions of all six genotypes as predicted by Mendelian segregation, including RKA− mAGT−/− and RKA+ mAGT−/− (Table III). To further determine when mAGT−/− mice died, we carefully examined offspring from newborn to 10 days of age and collected dead pups as they appeared. Similar to the findings at 3 week of age, of a total of 52 live 10-day-old offspring, none of them genotyped as mAGT−/− (data not shown), suggesting all homozygous mAGT−/− mice died before 10 days of age (generally between 4 and 5 days of age). Indeed, when we genotyped the dead pups, we found that 20 of 27 pups (12 of 16 RKA+ and 8 of 11 RKA−) were also mAGT−/−, a clear enrichment in that genotype (Table IV).Table IIStratified genotype summary of hREN/KAP-hAGT mice at 3 weeks of agemAGTR/KA+ (n = 63)R/KA− (n = 65)ObservedExpectedObservedExpected+/+24162516+/−39314033−/−016016χ2p < 0.0001p < 0.0001 Open table in a new tab Table IIIStratified genotype summary of newborn hREN/KAP-hAGT micemAGTR/KA+ (n = 93)R/KA− (n = 66)ObservedExpectedObservedExpected+/+18231216+/−50473834−/−25231616χ2p = 0.68p = 0.67 Open table in a new tab Table IVStratified genotype summary of hREN/KAP-hAGT mice found dead in their cagemAGTR/KA+ (n = 16)R/KA− (n = 11)ObservedExpectedObservedExpected+/+1423+/−3815−/−12483χ2p = 0.018p = 0.077 Open table in a new tab Because the expression of hAGT in the KAP-hAGT model is sexually dimorphic and androgen-responsive, we considered the possibility that females would have increased lethality as compared with males. We therefore genotyped mice at the sry locus located on the Y chromosome to distinguish between males from females (Fig. 2). There was no significant difference between the number of males and females in any group of mice, including those that died between birth and 1 week of age (Table V).Table VSummary of male and female hREN/KAP-hAGT miceAgeMalesFemalesObservedExpectedObservedExpectedNewborn7980808010-day252627263-Week73645564Dead <1 week12141514Cumulative χ2p = 0.87p = 0.90 Open table in a new tab To ensure that the lack of complementation was not due to the absence of hAGT protein, we performed immunohistochemistry on kidney sections from nontransgenic and transgenic mice (Fig.3). Along with our previous report showing expression of hAGT mRNA in proximal tubule cells (21Ding Y. Davisson R.L. Hardy D.O. Zhu L.-J. Merrill D.C. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28142-28148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), these results clearly demonstrate the production of hAGT protein in the kidney. Moreover, consistent with apical secretion of hAGT in proximal tubule cells (26Rohrwasser A. Morgan T. Dillon H.F. Zhao L. Callaway C.W. Hillas E. Zhang S. Cheng T. Inagami T. Ward K. Terreros D.A. Lalouel J.M. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), we detected hAGT protein in the urine of transgenic mice (5.01 ± 0.69 pmol/ml) but not nontransgenic mice (0.34 ± 0.14 pmol/ml, representing the background of the assay). Although we could not accurately measure intrarenal Ang-II in the KAP-hAGT model, double transgenic mice containing the hREN and KAP-hAGT transgene exhibit hypertension (143 ± 5 versus 113 ± 3 mmHg in control mice) due to the production of Ang-II in kidney (20Davisson R.L.

Studies using the Ang-II AT-1 receptor antagonist losartan confirmed that the blood pressure elevation was due to an intrarenal Ang-II-dependent mechanism (20Davisson R.L. Ding Y. Stec D.E. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Finally, we considered the possibility that, because hAGT is driven by the KAP promoter in KAP-hAGT transgenic mice, the inability to rescue the lethality may be due to the absence of transgene expression during late development. To examine this, we performed timed breeding and used RNase protection to compare the time course of hAGT transgene expression during gestation and neonatal life with that of the endogenous mAGT and KAP genes. As anticipated, the KAP-hAGT transgene was expressed at precisely the same developmental stages as endogenous KAP (Fig.4 B). Expression was evident in whole fetuses at E11.5 and in kidney beginning at E16.5. Transgene expression in kidney was evident in newborns and in mice 1 and 2 weeks of age. When compared with endogenous mAGT expression, it was evident that expression of the transgene tended to precede and was higher than expression of endogenous mAGT (Fig. 4 A), although fetal expression of mAGT was evident on a longer exposure (data not shown). It is therefore unlikely that the inability of the kidney-specific transgene to rescue the lethal phenotype was related to the lack of transgene expression. The major finding of the present study is that transfer of both KAP-hAGT (localized to proximal tubule) and hREN transgenes onto the mouse angiotensinogen knockout (mAGT−/−) background is not sufficient to rescue the lethality associated with this model. Consistent with previous reports, mouse AGT knockout mice were born in predicted Mendelian ratios, but died soon after birth (14Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Kluckman K.D. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B. Best C.F.

Smithies O. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study, no mAGT−/− mice survived past 10 days of age, regardless of the presence or absence of the KAP-hAGT and hREN transgenes. One possibility for the inability to rescue is that the transgenes were not active during a critical developmental period or perhaps they were expressed in inappropriate locations. However, an examination of temporal and spatial expression of the transgenes suggests that this explanation is unlikely. According to our data, the KAP-hAGT transgene was expressed in a similar temporal window as the endogenous gene. Moreover, we previously reported that the transgene is expressed in proximal tubule cells, the same cells that express mAGT endogenously in the kidney (21Ding Y. Davisson R.L. Hardy D.O. Zhu L.-J. Merrill D.C. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28142-28148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike our observation in adult mice, hAGT is similarly expressed in both males and females during early stages of development. It is not until after 4 weeks of age that expression in males becomes much higher than in females. Although all studies report significant mortality and renal abnormalities associated with deletion of RAS function, the severity (or penetrance) appears to be highly variable among models and laboratories. The perinatal mortality rate of mAGT−/− mice in this study (essentially 100%) is much higher than previously reported (60–70%). One explanation is that genetic background may contribute to the high mortality rate we observed. The heterozygous mAGT+/− mice used in our study were maintained by six generations of backcross breeding with inbred C57BL/6 mice. Similarly, the KAP-hAGT and hREN mice used in this study were maintained by 5 and 10 generations of backcross breeding with C57BL/6, respectively. Therefore, all the mice described herein are essentially C57BL/6 congenic. It is interesting to note that homozygous AT-1A receptor-deficient mice containing a mixed C57BL/6 and 129 background survive normally and exhibit normal kidney morphology, whereas homozygous AT-1A receptor-deficient mice maintained on a congenic C57BL/6 or inbred 129 background exhibit substantially reduced survival and abnormal kidney structure (27Le T.H. Fogo A. Oliverio M.I. Peterson A.S. Smithies O. Coffman T.M. Genetic modifiers in type 1A (AT1A) angiotensin II receptor deficiency..J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10 (Abstract): 396AGoogle Scholar). We reported that transfer of both the hREN and systemically expressed hAGT transgenes onto the mAGT knockout background restores survival and corrects the renal abnormalities caused by the mAGT deletion (18Davisson R.L. Kim H.S. Krege J.H. Lager D.J. Smithies O. Sigmund C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In that study, human angiotensinogen was expressed not only in proximal tubule cells but also in other tissues such as liver, brain, and heart, etc., all normal sites for AGT expression. Because hAGT was expressed in the liver, plasma AGT and angiotensin II levels were elevated. This increase in plasma Ang-II was sufficient to not only rescue lethality but to reverse the hypotension and correct the renal lesions normally associated with mAGT−/− mice. This stands in contrast to the KAP-hAGT model used in the present study, in which circulating hAGT levels remain undetectable and will not have any circulating Ang-II when bred onto the mAGT−/− genetic background (20Davisson R.L. Ding Y. Stec D.E. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Ding Y. Davisson R.L. Hardy D.O. Zhu L.-J. Merrill D.C. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28142-28148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the very early lethality of mAGT−/− observed in our study precluded any detailed renal histological analysis. Nevertheless, examination of several mAGT−/− kidneys from mice, which died before 10 days of age, did not show any clear evidence of renal lesions. This is not particularly surprising, because most of the lesions previously reported were in those rare mice that survived well past 3 weeks of age. This raises the intriguing possibility that circulating, rather than proximal tubule-derived Ang-II, is required for continued development of the kidney after birth. In agreement with this hypothesis, Kang et al. (28Kang N. Walther T. Tian X. Lippoldt A. Ganten D. Bader M. Local angiotensin synthesis is crucial in hypertension-induced end-organ damage..Hypertens. 1999; 34 (abstr.): 344Google Scholar) reported that mAGT-deficient mice expressing the rat angiotensinogen (rAGT) only in the brain and liver did not exhibit renal lesions. These findings suggest that normalization of circulating Ang-II alone is sufficient to rescue the renal lesions in mAGT-deficient mice and provide additional evidence of the crucial importance of circulating Ang-II in renal development. In the present study, the use of the KAP promoter allowed for precise targeting of hAGT to the proximal tubule, the predominant site for AGT production in the kidney. The exact function of proximal tubule AGT production remains unclear; however, multiple lines of evidence suggest an important role in electrolyte balance and blood pressure regulation. The localization of AGT in proximal tubule, its polarized secretion into the proximal tubular lumen, and the presence of high levels of Ang-II in proximal tubular fluid have been clearly demonstrated (26Rohrwasser A. Morgan T. Dillon H.F. Zhao L. Callaway C.W. Hillas E. Zhang S. Cheng T. Inagami T. Ward K. Terreros D.A. Lalouel J.M.

Ang-II has been reported to stimulate the sodium/hydrogen exchanger, an important regulator of proximal tubule sodium reabsorption, independently of systemic angiotensin, and may also indirectly affect proximal reabsorption by increasing the sensitivity of the tubuloglomerular feedback system (31Saccomani G. Mitchell K.D. Navar L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1188-F1195PubMed Google Scholar, 32Quan A. Baum M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2878-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Ploth D.W. Rudulph J. LaGrange R. Navar L.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Importantly, our previous study showed that overexpression of the intrarenal RAS in transgenic mice chronically increased blood pressure independent of circulating Ang-II, providing strong evidence for the possibility that the intrarenal RAS per se plays a significant role in blood pressure regulation (20Davisson R.L. Ding Y. Stec D.E. Catterall J.F. Sigmund C.D. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system in the proximal tubule may not necessary for normal renal growth and development, and its loss is unlikely to be the cause of neonatal death in mAGT-deficient mice. Based on all available data, we conclude that the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system located in the proximal tubule plays an important role in blood pressure regulation and may cause hypertension if overexpressed but may not be required for continued development of the kidney after birth.

We investigated the proximal promoter region of COL4A5 and COL4A6 using glomerular visceral epithelial cells, in which COL4A5 alone is transcribed; keratinocytes, in which the genes are co-transcribed; and additional model cell lines. By RNase protection assays, the intergenic region is 292 base pairs. Transcription start sites for two 5′ splice variants of COL4A6 are 1 kilobase apart. Transient transfections with reporter gene constructs revealed that the minimal promoters for COL4A5 and COL4A6 are within 100 base pairs of their respective transcription start sites and are functionally distinct. In further transfection, gel shift and footprinting assays, we defined a bidirectional positive regulatory element, which functions in several cell types, but not in glomerular visceral epithelial cells selectively transcribing COL4A5. The existence of separate promoters for COL4A5 andCOL4A6 permits fine control over their expression. Activation through the bidirectional element can bring about co-expression of the genes, exploiting their paired arrangement. Features of the proximal promoter region frame its roles in a hierarchy regulating type IV collagen gene expression."

ATP-binding cassette nucleotide binding domains 2′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) nucleotide-binding sites 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid One of the most frequently employed strategies to gain resistance to cytotoxic compounds in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes is the active extrusion of these compounds from the cell to reduce the intracellular concentration to subtoxic levels (1Dey S. Rosen B.P. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 103-132Google Scholar). Protein pumps that span the membrane catalyze this extrusion process, and many of them belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1 superfamily (2Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). This family includes the human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, which confers resistance to anti-cancer drugs (2Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar), and homologues from bacteria (3van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fungi (5Vanden Bossche H. Dromer F. Improvisi I. Lozano-Chiu M. Rex J.H. Sanglard D. J. Med. Vet. Mycology Suppl. 1998; 36: 119-128Google Scholar), and protozoa (6Borst P. Ouellette M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 427-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Generally, these ABC transporters are composed of two homologous halves, each containing two parts as follows: a transmembrane domain putatively arranged into 6 α-helices and a nucleotide binding domain (NBD). Our understanding of the mode of operation of these efflux pumps is still rudimentary, and several fundamental questions concerning their function need to be answered if we are to design inhibitors that block these pumps, allowing us to overcome multidrug resistance. For example, since most, if not all, ABC drug transporters have two nucleotide-binding sites (NBS), it is of importance to determine whether these sites are functionally equivalent. Biochemical studies of P-glycoprotein indicate that both NBS can hydrolyze ATP, but substrate-stimulated ATPase activity requires interaction between the two halves of the molecule (7Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation by chemical modification or mutagenesis of either NBS causes a loss of activity, suggesting cooperativity between the sites (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22957-22961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Sharom F.J. Liu R. Romsicki Y. Lu P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 327-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the sites function by an alternating site mechanism (10Senior A.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163: 213-218Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein has been overexpressed and can be purified as a functional ATPase in low concentration of detergent, enabling biophysical studies of the protein (11Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The binding of fluorescent analogues of ATP to the protein indicated that there is a single class of site, suggesting that the two NBS are equivalent. Perhaps this is not surprising because the NBS have similar sequences. Although the NBS of P-glycoprotein resemble one another, this is not the case for other mammalian ABC drug transporters, such as multidrug resistance protein 1, and recent studies have shown that the NBS of multidrug resistance protein 1 are nonequivalent (12Nagata K. Nishitani M. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17626-17630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13Gao M. Cui H.-R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Clearly, to understand fully how the NBS interact will require structural information. A recent advance in our understanding has come from the determination, by x-ray crystallography, of the structure of HisP (14Hung L.-W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 15Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), the ATPase subunit of the histidine permease, a bacterial ABC transporter that catalyzes the uptake of histidine. Although arranging the monomeric HisP into a dimer is speculative, the structure predicts that the two nucleotide-binding sites are orientated away from one another. Inactivation of one of these sites results in a transporter that has half the ATPase and transport activity of the wild-type protein complex (16Nikaido K. Ames G.F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26727-26735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting that there is little or no cooperativity between these sites. This may represent a real difference with P-glycoprotein, because cross-linking studies have shown that the NBS of P-glycoprotein are in close proximity (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19435-19438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, the NBD of P-glycoprotein has a site for ligands, such as flavonoids, that modulate drug transport, probably by inhibiting the ATPase activity (18Conseil G. Baubichon-Cortay H. Dayan G. Jault J.M. Barron D. DiPictro A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9831-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, we do not have a view of the structure of P-glycoprotein at atomic resolution, and at the present we must glean information from other efflux pumps that have proved more amenable to structure-function studies. The ArsAB ATPase is a prokaryotic pump that exhibits structural and functional similarity to P-glycoprotein (19Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Walmsley A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). They are both efflux pumps for multiple forms of toxic compounds, have two similar consensus nucleotide binding domains, are substrate-dependent ATPases, have 12 membrane-spanning α-helices arranged in two groups of six, and their NBDs contain allosteric sites. As such, the arsenical pump is a useful model for the study of the molecular mechanism of resistance pumps. However, the arsenical pump is composed of two proteins, ArsA and ArsB; ArsA is the 63-kDa catalytic subunit that couples ATP hydrolysis to oxyanion translocation, whereas ArsB is the 45-kDa membrane sector of the pump, a 12-helix protein that acts as the oxyanion-translocating sector of the pump. ArsA is normally bound to ArsB but can be purified as a soluble ATPase in the absence of ArsB, facilitating detailed studies of its structure-function. ArsA is arranged into two homologous halves, the N-terminal (A1) (residues 1–282) and C-terminal (A2) (residues 321–583) domains, which are connected by a flexible 25-residue linker (residues 283–320) (19Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Walmsley A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and each domain has a consensus NBD. Site-directed mutagenesis of these sequences indicates that both NBDs are required for both catalysis and resistance (20Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of genetic studies, the A1 and A2 NBDs have been shown to interact during catalysis (22Li J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6796-6800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 23Li J. Liu S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25247-25252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and exhibit strong positive cooperativity (24Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25849-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The ArsA ATPase is allosterically regulated by its substrate metalloids As(III) and Sb(III) (1Dey S. Rosen B.P. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 103-132Google Scholar). This is similar to the allosteric activation of the P-glycoprotein by drug substrates (1Dey S. Rosen B.P. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 103-132Google Scholar) and may be a common feature of ABC transporters. Indeed, bacterial ABC transporters frequently include ATPase subunits with an allosteric site that controls the ATPase activity (4Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a most important advance, the structure of ArsA has been determined to atomic resolution (25Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The structure of ArsA indicates that the A1 and A2 halves of ArsA are arranged into two domains, with the NBS formed from residues contributed from both domains and are located at the interface between them in close proximity to one another. These structural and functional properties of ArsA indicate that the NBS are likely to resemble those in P-glycoprotein and certainly more so than HisP. In common with P-glycoprotein, the NBD of ArsA are in close proximity, face one another, and interactions between them are necessary to support ATPase activity and transport. Previously, we established that the tryptophan fluorescence of W159H6 ArsA was far more responsive to the binding of the substrate MgATP than the product MgADP, allowing us to exploit this behavior in elucidating the substrate binding, but not the product release, steps of the ATPase mechanism by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy (19Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Walmsley A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

(2001) Biochemistry, in press.Google Scholar). In contrast, the W141H6 ArsA is more responsive to the binding of the product MgADP than the substrate MgATP (28Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and here we exploit this behavior in elucidating the product release steps of the ATPase mechanism. W141H6 ArsA and W159H6 ArsA were purified as described previously (28Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), quickly frozen, and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. The concentration of purified ArsA was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficients for W141H6 ArsA and W159H6 ArsA were calculated to be 21,530 and 20,250m−1 cm−1, respectively (28Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An Applied Photophysics(London, UK) SX.18MV stopped-flow instrument, operated at 20 °C, was used to monitor ligand-induced changes in the steady-state fluorescence of ArsA with time. For measurements of the change in tryptophan fluorescence, the samples were excited with light at 292.5 nm, selected with a monochromator, and the emission monitored at wavelengths above 335 nm, using a cut-off filter. For measurements of the change in MANT fluorescence, the samples were excited with light at 292.5 nm, selected with a monochromator, and the emission monitored at wavelengths above 420 nm, using a cut-off filter. Invariably, equal volumes of the reactants were mixed together in the stopped-flow instrument, using two syringes of equal volume. The concentration of ArsA was 5 μm, unless otherwise noted, in 50 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.25 mm EDTA. All concentrations are for the mixing chamber, unless stated otherwise, so that the concentrations in the syringe were twice those quoted for the mixing chamber. The base-line fluorescence was generally set by mixing 5 μmArsA with buffer and increasing the photomultiplier tube voltage to a level that would give a 4-V signal and ligand-induced changes in fluorescence measured relative to this signal (i.e. an increase in the signal from 4 to 4.1 V would correspond to a 2.5% increase in fluorescence and from 4 to 3.9 V a 2.5% quench in fluorescence). Since some of the experiments were conducted over a long time base, we decided to test for photobleaching of the protein by monitoring the fluorescence of ArsA, mixed with buffer in the stopped-flow instrument, over 1000 s; no decay in the protein fluorescence was observed over this time. As a routine second check of fluorescence signals that decay over 1000 s, we have closed the lamp shutter during data acquisition for about 100–200 s and then re-opened it before the end of the reaction. In this manner we have been able to check that the signal continues to decay in the absence of light, indicating that it represents a true ligand-induced change in the protein fluorescence rather than photobleaching. Since ADP inner-filter effects would tend to reduce the signal size for the high concentrations of ADP used in some of the assays, we conducted the following experiment to measure the inner-filter effect for a series of ADP concentrations, bovine serum albumin was mixed with increasing concentrations of ADP up to 5 mm, and the drop in base-line signal was recorded. An inner-filter effect was observed, but it was much less severe than observed in a conventional fluorimeter, increasing linearly over the studied range, with concentrations below 5 mm decreasing the base-line signal by less than 10%. The experiment was also repeated with ArsA W159H6, which is optically unresponsive to the binding of ADP (28Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Accordingly, data points were corrected for this small inner-filter effect. Stopped-flow traces, generated using a logarithmic time base (29Walmsley A.R. Bagshaw C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were analyzed by fitting to single (e.g. s = A·exp−kt; where s represents the change in signal (e.g.volts or % fluorescence), t the time, A andk the amplitude and rate constant for the signal change, respectively) or multiple exponential functions (e.g. s = A1·exp−k (1)t +A2·exp−k (2)t +A3·exp−k (3)t, for a triple exponential function) using the nonlinear regression software with theApplied Photophysics stopped-flow. As a guide to the adequacy of a particular equation to define a data set, we increased the number of exponential parameters within the equation until the data points were randomly distributed about the best fit line in a plot of the residual variance. Concentration dependence data were analyzed by nonlinear regression fitting to hyperbolic functions, using SIGMAPLOT 4.0. Kinetic simulations were set up using the program Pro-K (Applied Photophysics), which uses the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm for global optimization of the reaction parameters. A continuous assay was used to monitor phosphate production by ArsA. Essentially, the absorbance change at 360 nm associated with the phosphorolysis of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine by the inorganic phosphate generated by the ATPase activity was monitored (26Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16153-16161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The phosphorolysis reaction was catalyzed by purine nucleotide phosphorylase. The components of the assay were provided as part of an EnzCheck phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Assays were performed in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, containing 0.2 mm sodium azide. The change in absorbance with time was measured in a Unicam (UV2) UV-visible spectrometer. Absorbance changes were converted into phosphate concentrations with ΔE360 = 12 mm−1·cm−1. For stopped-flow studies, both syringes contained the components of the reaction kit, but one syringe contained 10 μm ArsA and the other 1 mm MgATP. The binding of MgADP to W141H6 ArsA causes a quench in the tryptophan fluorescence of the protein that can be time-resolved by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. Fig.1 shows representative stopped-flow records for the mixing of 5 μm W141H6 ArsA with ADP/5 mm MgCl2. In each case the profile was clearly multiphasic, with a very fast (t 12 <2 ms) phase that was well resolved from a slow decay over 1000 s. Overall, the traces could be fitted to a 4-exponential function, indicative of four phases with t 12 <1 ms, t 12 <2 s, t 12 <40 s, and t 12<400 s, respectively. However, we found that as the ADP concentration was increased a 5-exponential function gave a better fit because of the appearance of a phase with a t 12<3 ms. Although this phase involved an increase in fluorescence, this was only slight and not well resolved from the very fast decrease in fluorescence at low ADP concentrations. As shown in Fig. 1, only the rate and amplitude of the very fast phase varied with the ADP concentration, indicating that the slower phases were due to isomerizations of the ArsA-ADP complex. The rate constant for the very fast phase increased in a hyperbolic manner with the MgADP concentration (Fig.2 A). A fit of the rate data to the following hyperbolic Equation 1, kobs=kmax·[ADP]Kd+[ADP]+kminEquation 1 indicated maximal (kmax) and minimal (kmin) rates of binding of 600 (± 20) and 30 (± 20) s− 1, respectively, and aKd of 600 (± 100) μm. This behavior is consistent with the fast phase attributable to a two-step binding process shown in Scheme 1, ArsA2+MgADP⇆k2[MgADP]k−2ArsA3­MgADP⇆k3k−3ArsA4­MgADPSCHEME 1where the first step is a rapid equilibrium binding of MgADP to ArsA, followed by a rate-limiting isomerization of the ArsA-MgADP complex. Applying Equation 1 to Scheme 1, Kd is equivalent to 1/K2 (=k−2/k2),kmax = k3 +k−3 and kmin =k−3. The overall equilibrium constant is a function of both K2 andK3 (Equation 2), Kd=(1/K2)(1+K3)Equation 2 where K2 = 0.6 mm andK3 =k3/k−3 = 600/30 = 20. Thus, the apparent Kd value can be calculated as 24 μm. However, a plot of the amplitude data (Fig.2 B), which will provide a measure of the overallKd, yielded a value of 800 (± 100) μm. A plausible explanation for this behavior is that the ArsA exists in two rapidly inter-converting conformational forms that differ in their affinities for MgADP (Scheme 2), ArsA1⇆K1ArsA2+MgADP⇆K2ArsA3­MgADP⇆K3ArsA3­MgADPSCHEME 2The overall Kd value is a function ofK1, K2, andK3 (Equation 3), Kd=1K2·(1+K1)(1+K3)Equation 3 Accordingly, K1 can be calculated, from the overall Kd and K2, as 27, indicating that 96% of the ArsA is in the ArsA1conformation prior to the binding of MgADP. We attempted to measure the rate constant for the dissociation of MgADP from the ArsA-MgADP complex by displacement with MANT-ADP. As shown in Fig.3 A, when 5 μmArsA, 0.5 mm MgADP was mixed with 125 μmMANT-ADP, 5 mm MgCl2 there was an increase in MANT fluorescence, indicating that the ADP had been replaced. However, an identical trace was obtained when the ADP was included with the MANT-ADP (Fig. 3 C), rather than with the ArsA, during the mixing experiment. This behavior suggests that the ADP can rapidly dissociate from the ArsA and competes with MANT-ADP for binding to ArsA. For this to occur, ADP dissociation must be faster than the binding of MANT-ATP to ArsA (e.g. 223 s− 1 for 125 μm MANT-ATP (Fig.3 B)). 2This experiment was repeated for several lower concentrations of ADP with the same result that MgADP dissociation is rapid compared with the rate of binding of MANT-ATP to ArsA. In contrast, extrapolation of the data in Fig. 2 to the y axis suggested a much slower rate of dissociation (e.g. k = 30 (± 20) s− 1). Conceivably, this might provide a measure ofk−3 rather than k−2 in Scheme 1, but it could also arise if the two NBS had different affinities (see below). In a parallel set of experiments, the binding of Mg2+ to the W141H6 ArsA-ADP complex was investigated, revealing a similar behavior; formation of the ArsA-MgADP complex led to a fast quench in fluorescence, followed by a slow decay over several minutes (Fig.4). Only the rate of the fast phase was dependent upon the ADP concentration, suggesting that the three slow phases are attributable to isomerizations of the ArsA-MgADP complex (data not shown). The rate of the fast phase increased in a hyperbolic manner (Fig. 5 A), deviating only slightly at high concentrations, and the early data points were best fit to a hyperbolic equation with a zero intercept (Equation4),Figure 5The ADP concentration dependence of the rate of formation of the ArsA-MgADP complex induced by the binding of Mg2+ to the ArsA-ADP complex. A series of stopped-flow records were generated by mixing ArsA, equilibrated with ADP at the indicated concentration, with 5 mm MgCl2 in a stopped-flow device. The rate (A) and amplitude (B) of the fluorescence signal for the formation of the ArsA-MgADP complex are plotted as a function of the ADP concentration. The curves through the data points are the best fits to a hyperbolic equation, indicating values of 170 (± 10) s−1and 90 (± 10) μm for kmax andKd, respectively, in A, and of 190 μm (± 20) and 29% (± 1) for the Kdand maximal fluorescence change (Fmax) inB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) kobs=kmax·[ADP]Kd+[ADP]Equation 4 Thus, the fit yielded a Kd of 90 (± 10) μm and a maximal rate of binding of 170 (± 10) s− 1. This analysis indicated that the back rate, determined from the intercept of the y axis, was too slow for accurate determination. A possible explanation for the relatively high affinity binding might be that ADP alone stabilizes the ArsA2 conformation. Consistent with this prediction, the amplitude data indicated a Kd of 190 (± 20) μm and a maximal quench in fluorescence (Fmax) of 29 (± 1)% (Fig. 5 B). The relatively slow rate constant for formation of the ArsA-MgADP complex from ArsA-ADP and Mg2+ (e.g. kmax = 170 (± 10) s− 1), as compared with that from ArsA and MgADP (e.g. kmax = 600 (± 100) s− 1), indicates a more complex binding process than the simple addition of Mg2+ to the ArsA-ADP complex. The Mg2+ cannot bind directly to the ArsA2-ADP complex, nor can complex formation be rate-limited by ADP dissociation from ArsA2, otherwise the rate of complex formation would be independent of the ADP concentration. A plausible explanation of this kinetic behavior is that at sufficiently high concentrations of ADP, when the binding of MgADP would be faster than the dissociation of ADP from the ArsA2-ADP complex, ADP dissociation becomes rate-limiting. Thus interpreting the data implies that ADP dissociates from the ArsA-ADP complex with a rate constant of 170 s− 1. To test the prediction that ADP dissociation from ArsA2 becomes rate-limiting at high ADP concentrations, we attempted to measure the ADP dissociation rate constant, in the absence of Mg2+, by displacement with MANT-ADP. The binding of MANT-ADP to ArsA induced a rapid increase in MANT fluorescence, followed by a slower increase, which was best fit to a 4-exponential function, yielding a rate constant of 350 (± 10) s− 1 for the fast phase (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, when ArsA was preincubated with ADP, before mixing with MANT-ADP, only the rapid increase in MANT fluorescence was apparent, although the data were best fit to a double exponential function, with the fast phase occurring with a rate constant of 170 (± 40) s− 1 (Fig. 6 B). It is most likely that the difference in reaction profiles is attributable to dissociation of the ArsA-ADP complex rate-limiting the binding of MANT-ADP. A proposal that was supported by the fact that a similar trace to that obtained for the binding of MANT-ADP alone was obtained when ArsA was mixed with MANT-ADP/ADP (Fig. 6 C). Although, as expected, preincubating the MANT-ADP with ADP caused a reduction in the signal amplitude and yielded a slower rate constant, this is consistent with the ADP competing with the MANT-ADP for binding to ArsA. We conclude that ADP dissociates from ArsA with a rate constant of 170–200 s− 1. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that reducing the ADP concentration with which the ArsA was preincubated from 0.5 to 0.25 mm had no effect upon the apparent rate constant for the binding of MANT-ADP (data not shown). The data presented herein supports the existence of an ArsA-ADP complex, and the value obtained for the rate constant for the dissociation of ADP is comparable with that determined for the maximal rate of formation of the ArsA-MgADP binary complex from ArsA-ADP and Mg2+. Accordingly, this behavior is consistent with the rate-limiting dissociation of ADP from ArsA during the formation of the ArsA-MgADP complex from ArsA-ADP and Mg2+. The decrease in the tryptophan fluorescence upon formation of the ArsA-MgADP complex can be reversed by mixing with EDTA, suggesting that ADP is released as EDTA chelates the Mg2+. The stopped-flow trace shown in Fig. 7 B, for the mixing of 5 μm ArsA, 0.5 mm ADP, 5 mm MgCl2 with 20 mm EDTA, was best fit to a double exponential function, with rate constants of 6.6 and 0.17 s− 1, and relative signal amplitudes of 0.9 and 0.1, respectively, giving a total fluorescence change of 22%. This value for the increase in fluorescence is comparable to the decrease in fluorescence for the binding of Mg2+ to the ArsA-ADP (e.g. 5 μm ArsA/0.5 mmADP) complex (cf. 22 versus 21%), indicating that the 20 mm EDTA caused the ArsA-MgADP complex to fully dissociate. 3A signal of comparable amplitude and rate was obtained when 100 mm EDTA was used to induce dissociation of the ArsA-MgADP complex (Fig. 7 A). The dominant phase, which occurred with a rate constant of 6.6 s− 1, must be attributable to the dissociation of the complex because there are no isomerizations of a comparable rate for ternary complex formation from ArsA/ADP and Mg2+(e.g. see Fig. 4). The slow rate of dissociation suggests that the ArsA-MgADP complex is relatively stable. Indeed, dilution of the ArsA-MgADP complex, by mixing with buffer in the stopped-flow, was insufficient to dissociate the complex (Fig. 7 E). These data raise an apparent anomaly because the binding of MgMANT-ADP to ArsA is not rate-limited by the dissociation of the ArsA-MgADP complex (e.g. see Fig. 3). A simple explanation for this behavior is that the A1 and A2 NBS have different affinities. EDTA is necessary to induce dissociation of MgADP from the high affinity site, but MANT-ADP can displace MgADP from the low"

Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). FXI exists as a covalently linked two-chain homodimer, thus making it unique among coagulation factors. Dimeric FXI circulates in plasma as a zymogen in a 1:2 stoichiometric complex with the cofactor high molecular weight kininogen at plasma concentrations in the range of 4–6 μg/ml (∼30 nm) (2Saito H. Goldsmith Jr., G.H. Blood. 1977; 50: 377-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Thompson R.E. Mandle Jr., R. Kaplan A.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Each subunit of the dimer contains 607 amino acids and has a molecular mass of ∼80,000 Da based on reducing SDS gel electrophoresis (4Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The activation of this zymogen to an active serine protease can be carried out in the presence of a polyanionic surface by activated factor XII and high molecular weight kininogen, thrombin, or activated FXI (FXIa) (4Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5831-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5Naito K. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7353-7358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation is dependent upon cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg369 and Ile370 (6Fujikawa K. Chung D.W. Hendrickson L.E. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Each subunit of FXIa is composed of a heavy (50,000 Da) and light (30,000 Da) chain held together via disulfide bonds (4Kurachi K. Davie E.W.

Kato H. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4508-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The heavy chain of FXIa contains four tandem repeat sequences called Apple domains consisting of 90–91 amino acids each (8Asakai R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7221-7228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Each of the four Apple domains contains three internal disulfide bonds, and the first and fourth Apple domains each contain one additional cysteine residue (9McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W.

One of the more provocative questions surrounding FXI is its homodimeric structure and how that relates to its physiologic function in blood coagulation. FXI is activated on the platelet surface, and the resulting FXIa subsequently activates FIX (7Fujikawa K. Legaz M.E. Kato H. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4508-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The recombinant A3 domain of FXI binds to the activated platelet surface with the same stoichiometry (∼1500 sites/platelet) as that found for full-length dimeric FXI, suggesting that one A3 domain/dimer is responsible for the interaction with the platelet surface (16Ho D.H. Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 59: 316-323Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since it is difficult to rationalize one A3 (17Sun Y. Gailani D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29023-29028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and/or A2 (13Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24190-24197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) domain of FXI binding to both FIX and to the platelet surface simultaneously, it has been hypothesized that the A3 domain from one subunit of the dimer binds the platelet, while the A2 and/or A3 domain of the opposite subunit interacts with FIX. Gailani et al. (20Gailani D. Sun M.-F. Ho D. Zhao M. Cheng Q. Walsh P.N. Blood. 1999; 94 (abstr.): 621aCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that recombinantly derived FXI monomers in which the A4 domain of FXI was replaced with that of prekallikrein (FXI/PKA4) in comparison with their dimeric counterparts (FXI/PKA4-Ala326and wild-type FXI) were functionally defective in a partial thromboplastin time assay utilizing platelets as a surface, but normal with phospholipids. These results are consistent with the aforementioned hypothesis since the monomeric chimera bound to the platelet surface lacks an additional free A2 and/or A3 domain for interaction with FIX and would therefore be deficient in its ability to activate FIX. Additionally, FXI dimerization may be important for its ability to activate FIX since cleavage occurs at two spatially distinct sites. A detailed kinetic analysis of the activation of FIX by FXIa revealed that FIX is activated via a processive reaction mechanism without release of a singly cleaved intermediate (21Wolberg A.S. Morris D.P. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4074-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the possibility that each active site within the dimer carries out a single cleavage without the need for reorientation of the FIX molecule between successive cleavages, further suggesting that it may be functionally advantageous for FXI to exist as a dimeric molecule. To fully understand the functional significance of FXI homodimer formation, we aim to define the structural determinants and mechanism involved in this process. Meijers et al. (19Meijers J.C. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4680-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) demonstrated that at least part of the molecular information required for mediating dimer formation between the two identical subunits appears to reside within the A4 domain of FXI. Chimeric tissue plasminogen activator molecules with the A4 domain of FXI substituted for the finger and growth factor domains exist as dimers, as shown by gel filtration analysis (19Meijers J.C. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4680-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the same chimeras as well as the full-length FXI protein, the replacement of Cys321 with serine results in molecules that also exist as dimers, as determined by gel filtration (19Meijers J.C. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4680-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the A4 domains mediate noncovalent interactions resulting in dimer formation, which is subsequently stabilized by a covalent linkage between cysteine residues in each monomer at position 321 (9McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 19Meijers J.C. Mulvihill E.R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W.

The rA4 domain construct contains sequences that code for Phe271–Glu361. The construct was generated by utilizing PCR and FXI cDNA as a template (a 2.1-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment containing the complete FXI coding sequence, a generous gift from Drs. Dominic W. Chung, Kazuo Fujikawa, and Earl W. Davie, Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) to create a 318-base pair insert that is identical to that coding for the A4 domain of FXI. Primers that flank either end of the A4 domain coding sequence were prepared by Life Technologies, Inc. The 5′-upstream primer contains an engineered BamHI restriction site (GGATCC) along with a FXa cut site (ATCGAAGGTAGA) that, when translated (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg), was used to efficiently cleave an N-terminal 6-histidine tag. The 3′-downstream primer contains an engineeredPstI restriction site (CTGCAG) along with a stop codon (TAA) to ensure transcription termination. The sequence of the upstream primer (5′-BamHI) is as follows: 5′-CGCGGATCC(ATCGAAGGTAGA)TTCTGCCATTCTTCATTTTAC. The sequence of the downstream primer (3′-PstI) is as follows: 5′-AAAACTGCAG(TTA)CTCATTATCCATTTTACACAA. The PCR was set up as follows: 10 ng of FXI cDNA as template, a 1 μmconcentration of both the upstream (5′-BamHI) and downstream (3′-PstI) primers, 2.5 units of cloned Pfu DNA polymerase, 10 μl of 10× Pfu reaction buffer, and dNTPs at 0.2 mm brought to a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction mixture was then overlaid with 100 μl of mineral oil to prevent evaporation. The reaction mixtures were placed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA thermal cycler. The reactions were heated to 94 °C for 7 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 75 °C for 3 min. The reaction was completed by incubation at 75 °C for 7 min and a final incubation at 4 °C. The PCR was subsequently purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit. PCR was also performed in the generation of the C321S mutant (rA4-C321S). The PCR-based mutagenesis protocol was adapted from Picardet al. (23Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Template plasmid DNA was obtained using a QIAGEN plasmid purification kit (∼0.3-kilobase pair human FXI A4 domain subcloned into a pQE-9 expression vector). The mutagenesis reaction follows a three-step protocol. Step 1 involves synthesis of a megaprimer using a mutagenic primer and a downstream primer (3′-PstI). The mutagenic primer is as follows: 5′-CCAAGCATCC(A)GCAACGAAGG. The 11th base in the primer was switched from thymine in the wild-type sequence to adenine, thus allowing Cys321 to be replaced by serine in the mutant amino acid sequence. The reactions contained 10 ng of DNA template, 10 pmol (100 nm) each of the mutagenic and 3′-PstI primers, 2.5 units of cloned Pfu DNA polymerase, 10 μl of 10×Pfu reaction buffer, and dNTPs at 0.2 mm brought to a final volume of 95 μl. 10 cycles of amplification were performed for each step (94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min). The reaction was completed by incubation at 75 °C for 5 min with a final incubation at 4 °C. Addition of 50 pmol of the upstream primer (5′-BamHI) to the aqueous phase begins step 2, and addition of 50 pmol of the downstream primer (3′-PstI) initiates step 3. The same amplification protocol as employed in step 1 is used in steps 2 and 3. The insert was cut with BamHI andPstI restriction enzymes using the protocols supplied by New England Biolabs Inc. The insert was ligated to the QIAexpress pQE-9 vector, and transformations were carried out using competent E. coli K12-derived M15(pREP4) cells. Expression from the pQE-9 vector was induced by the addition of IPTG. Large-scale expression cultures (1 liter) were propagated in LB broth in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C. The large-scale cultures were inoculated from small-scale growth cultures (1:40, v/v). The cultures were grown untilA600 reached 0.6–0.7. Induction of protein expression required the addition of 0.5 mm IPTG, followed by further incubation and shaking at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g for 20 min) and then stored as cell pellets at −70 °C. The concentration of protein was determined by absorbance at 280 nm employing an extinction coefficient of 12,420 m−1cm−1 (per dimer). SDS-PAGE analysis was used to determine purity and to assure noncovalent association of subunits. Harvested cell pellets stored at −70 °C were resuspended in Buffer A (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, and 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 5 ml of buffer/g of cells and allowed to stir at room temperature for 1 h. The supernatant was collected from the cell lysate following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The crude extract was then mixed with a Ni2+-NTA resin slurry (50% Ni2+-NTA and 50% Buffer A, 10-ml total volume). The mixture was then allowed to stir at room temperature for 1 h. The crude extract/resin mixture was loaded onto a 10-ml polypropylene column (QIAGEN Inc.). A series of wash steps then ensued: 5 column volumes of Buffer B (8 murea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, and 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), a wash with Buffer C (8 murea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, and 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 6.3) until the eluant absorbance at 280 nm was <0.01, and 20 ml of Buffer D (8 m urea, 0.1m NaH2PO4, and 0.01 mTris-HCl, pH 5.9). The FXI rA4 domain was then eluted with 20 ml of buffer E (8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, and 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 4.5). Fractions containing protein were visualized by 15% SDS-PAGE. The protein was then refolded using a protocol that makes use of a thiol/disulfide exchange in which cysteine is utilized as the low molecular mass reducing molecule (24Saxena V.P. Wetlaufer D.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 5015-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was held in the range of 200–250 μg/ml. A Spectrapor dialysis membrane (9.3 ml/cm) with a 3500-Da cutoff was used. The starting buffer consisted of 2 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mmNaCl, and 2 mm cysteine at pH 9.0. A series of seven buffer changes was used to reduce the urea and cysteine concentrations (1m urea and 1 mm cysteine; 0.5 murea and 0.5 mm cysteine; 0.25 m urea and 250 μm cysteine; 0.1 m urea and 100 μm cysteine; and 0 urea and 0 cysteine). Upon completion of dialysis, the FXI rA4 domain was then concentrated via an Amicon stirred cell ultrafiltration apparatus using DIAFLO ultrafiltration membranes (3000-kDa cutoff). The protein solution was typically concentrated down to a volume of 2–4 ml, and the protein concentration (5.0 to 2.5 mg/ml) was determined. SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions was used throughout to monitor purification and under nonreducing conditions to detect correctly oxidized FXI rA4 domain. The N-terminal 6-histidine tag was removed by cleavage with bovine FXa. Bovine FXa cleaves proteins at the C-terminal side of the recognition sequence Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg, which is identical to that engineered at the N terminus of the FXI rA4 domain. Cleavage buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm NaCl, pH 9.0. A 1:50 molar ratio of FXa to the FXI rA4 domain was used. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 16–18 h. Upon completion of the reaction, success of cleavage was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. Following the cleavage reaction, separation of the His-tagged FXI rA4 domain from the non-His-tagged FXI rA4 domain was carried out using the HiTrap metal-chelating column (5 ml). The HiTrap resin was charged with Ni2+ ions by applying 2.5 ml of a 0.1 mNiSO4 solution. The cleavage reaction was applied to the column, followed by a 5-column volume (25 ml) wash step (20 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm NaCl at pH 9.0). The desired non-His-tagged FXI rA4 domain along with FXa was then eluted with 20 mm imidazole in the above buffer system. The final step in the purification made use of gel filtration chromatography to separate the FXI rA4 domain from bovine FXa and to obtain protein that formed productive dimers. A Superdex 75 gel filtration column was equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The proteins were resolved at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and protein elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions that eluted at a retention time representative of the dimeric FXI rA4 domain were pooled and concentrated with a Millipore concentrator. To determine the multimeric state of the eluted protein, data compiled for a standard curve were generated using the MW-GF-70 gel filtration molecular mass marker kit. To assess purity, all fractions were assayed for the presence of FXa using the chromogenic substrate S-2765. The protein was subsequently examined by SDS-PAGE. The rA4 domain was examined by HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (analysis conducted by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). The data demonstrated the presence of a single homogeneous species of protein with a molecular mass of 19,836 Da, which is consistent with the calculated molecular mass of the rA4 domain, which is 19,888 Da. Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) was used to determine free sulfhydryl groups (25Jaehicke R. Rudolph R. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford, England1989: 191-222Google Scholar), which indicated <0.04 mol of free sulfhydryl group/mol of rA4 domain. An Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system was used along with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC high resolution Superose 12 column (10 × 300 mm) to determine monomer-dimerKD for the FXI rA4 domain C321S mutant. A Superdex 75 column was also employed in purification and confirmation of dimer formation. To determine the multimeric state of the eluted proteins, data for a standard curve were compiled at varying pH values and salt concentrations using the MW-GF-70 gel filtration molecular mass marker kit. To construct standard curves, four proteins were employed with molecular masses as follows: albumin, 66,000 Da; carbonic anhydrase, 29,000 Da; cytochrome c, 12,400 Da; and aprotinin, 6500 Da. The effects of varying protein concentration, pH, and salt concentration were determined. All buffer solutions used to study pH effects contained 20 mm buffering reagent, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Buffering reagents for the various pH values tested were as follows: CAPS, pH 10.0; Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 and 8.0; HEPES, pH 7.0 and 7.4; and MES, pH 6.0. All buffer solutions used to study salt effects contained 20 mm HEPES, the appropriate NaCl concentration (0.025–2.0 m), and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. For all experimental studies, the proteins were dialyzed against the appropriate buffer for 16–18 h in Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes. The resultant protein solution was cleared of any precipitate by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 280 nm with the previously stated extinction coefficient. Samples were then prepared by dilution of concentrated stock solutions and incubated for ≥3 h at room temperature to ensure that equilibrium was established. Samples of 100 μl at various protein concentrations were injected onto the pre-equilibrated column. Elution of resolved protein species was in the same buffer as the sample equilibration at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution profile was followed by absorbance at 280 nm. The chromatograms were analyzed using FPLC Director software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The retention times were determined by comparison of elution peaks at peak half-width and peak half-height. The calculated area under the elution peaks was used to determine the amount and percentage of dimeric and monomeric species present in the sample. A plot of the percent dimeric rA4-C321S as a function of the total protein concentration was used to determine dimer KD. All experimentally determined KD values (KD(app)) were divided by a dilution factor of 6.5 ± 0.27. The dilution factor was employed since dilution of the protein sample occurs as the protein is eluted through the column. The justification for this correction can be found under “Results” and in Refs. 22Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and 36Zimmerman J.K. Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7289-7292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The dilution factor equals the peak width at half-height (milliliter) divided by the sample load volume (100 μl) (22Manning L.R. Jenkins W.T. Hess J.R. Vandegriff K. Winslow R.M. Manning J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 36Zimmerman J.K. Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7289-7292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Gibbs free energy of dissociation was calculated using the equation ΔG 0 = −RT ln KD, where R is the gas constant (1.987 cal × mol−1 × K−1), T is the absolute temperature at which experiments were done (298 K), and KD is the dissociation constant or the concentration at which equal amounts of dimer and monomer exist in solution. Fluorescence measurements were performed on an SLM-AMINCO/Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer. The stock solutions of bis-ANS were filtered, and the concentration was determined by absorbance at 385 nm using an extinction coefficient of ε385 = 16,790 cm−1m−1(30Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Varying amounts of the apolar probe were used to titrate the rA4 domain while monitoring extrinsic probe fluorescence. Protein concentrations were held constant at 0.5 μm. The samples were excited at 385 nm, and emission was monitored at 497 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths were set to 4 and 8 nm, respectively. All results were corrected with respect to spectra of buffer and protein background. The establishment of dissociation kinetics was followed in a time-dependent manner by monitoring the increase in bis-ANS fluorescence as well. For dissociation kinetics, the protein was diluted to a concentration of 0.5 μm in the presence of 20 μm bis-ANS. The data were evaluated using the program KaleidagraphTM (Abelbeck Software) and fitted using a first-order equation with a single rate constant. The association rate constant (kon) for the conversion of monomer to dimer was calculated using the following equation, KD =koff/kon, whereKD represents the dissociation constant determined by size exclusion chromatography and koff is the dissociation rate constant d"

Although it has been considered to contain only positive cis-regulatory sequences, our study of the enhancement conferred by segments of HS2 in erythroid cells reveals a novel negative element. Individual cis-regulatory elements from HS2 such as E boxes or Maf-response elements produced as great or greater enhancement than the intact core in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, indicating the presence of negative elements within HS2.

The genes are arranged 5′-HBE-HBG2-HBG1-HBD-HBB-3′ from the centromere to the telomere. The genes are temporally expressed in the order of their array along the chromosome, with ε-globin (encoded by HBE) produced embryonically, Gγ- and Aγ-globin (encoded by HBG2 andHBG1) produced fetally, and δ- and β-globin (encoded byHBD and HBB) produced in the adult.

To better understand the contribution of the several conserved sequences in the HS2 core to enhancement in erythroid cells, we developed methods using cationic lipids to transiently transfect several erythroid cell lines (50Elnitski L. Hardison R. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1999; 25: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This has allowed us to test constructs containing promoters from several β-like globin genes in murine MEL cells (which produce β-globin (51Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar)), human K562 cells (which produce ε- and γ-globin (52Rutherford T.R. Clegg J.B. Weatherall D.J. Nature. 1979; 280: 164-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 53Dean A. Ley T. Humphries R.K. Fordis M. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)), and human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells (which produce mainly γ-globin (54Martin P. Papayannopoulou T. Science. 1982; 216: 1233-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar)). The results identify cis-acting sequences within the HS2 core that negatively regulate expression of linked β-like globin genes in erythroid cell lines and in normal human adult erythroid cells. The negative effect is seen both in transiently transfected cells and after integration into stably transformed cells. The cationic lipid reagent Tfx50 (from Promega) was used to transiently transfect MEL, K562, and HEL cells (50Elnitski L. Hardison R. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1999; 25: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) following the manufacturer's protocol for suspension cells. Optimal transfection was obtained at a 2:1 ratio (charge to mass) of cationic lipid to DNA. The reagent and DNA remained in the cell culture for 48 h, at which point the cells were harvested. Three different experimental designs were used to examine the level of expression in transient transfections. In the first, each plasmid containing a reporter gene was assayed as a titration of DNA mass from 0.25 μg up to a maximum of 8.0 μg (maintaining the 2:1 charge to mass ratio), with the results reported as luciferase activity in relative light units (RLU)/s. In the second, plasmids were transfected in triplicate at the single DNA mass most frequently seen to be optimal for enhancement in each cell line, which was 2.0 μg for MEL cells and 3.0 μg for K562 and HEL cells. The resulting luciferase activities were normalized to the amount of total protein in each sample, which was determined by the Bio-Rad BCA microprotein assay. In this design, Student's t test was used to determine the probability that paired samples did not belong to distinct, nonoverlapping data sets. Our initial attempts to use pRSVlacZ as a cotransfection control were unsuccessful, since the amount of pRSVlacZ required to obtain activity above the background were incompatible with experimentally determined transfection conditions, which limited test DNA to a maximum of 2 μg total in MEL cells (50Elnitski L. Hardison R. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1999; 25: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Subsequent testing showed that small amounts of a cotransfection control vector expressing the luciferase gene from Renilla(sea pansy, Promega) provided measurable activity without interfering unacceptably with the test plasmid. Thus the third design was to include the Renilla luciferase cotransfection control plasmid in the following amounts: for MEL cells, 1.75 μg of test plasmid plus 0.25 μg of control plasmid, and for K562 and HEL cells, 1.9 μg of test plasmid and 0.1 μg of control plasmid. Normal human adult erythroid cells (hAEC) were cultured from human peripheral blood using the two-phase system of Fibach et al.(55Fibach E. Manor D. Oppenheim A. Rachmilewitz E.A. Blood. 1989; 73: 100-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were transiently transfected by electroporation using the methods described in Li et al. (56Li J. Noguchi C. Miller W. Hardison R. Schechter A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10202-10209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). MEL cells (1 × 106) were stably transfected using the Tfx50 reagent to introduce 1.5 μg of linearized test plasmid plus 0.5 μg of pSV2neo, a neomycin phosphotransferase expression vector. One day after transfection, G418 was added to the culture at 0.6 mg/ml. Pools of stably transfected cells were harvested after 2 weeks of growth under selection to measure luciferase activity. Pools of transfected cells were induced by growth in 4 mm hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) for 5 days; uninduced cultures were maintained for the same period in the absence of inducer. As described previously (32Elnitski L. Miller W. Hardison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), up to 20 μl of cellular extract was assayed in 100 μl of Promega luciferase assay reagent. Luciferase constructs containing the rabbit ε-globin promoter from −573 to +85, without (εluc or pBSε-luciferase.4) or with the human HS2 core (εHS2 or pBSε-luciferase-hHS2HX) have been described previously (48Jackson J.D.

The human HS2 core is the HindIII-XbaI fragment, HUMHBB positions 8486–8860. The β-globin-luciferase reporter constructs contained the mouse β-major globin gene (Hbb-b1) promoter sequence from −106 to + 26 (β106), −340 to +26 (β340) or the HBB promoter from −374 to +45 (hβ) fused to the luciferase-coding region of pGL2Basic (Promega) (58Taxman D.J. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6619-6627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The human HS2 core was added by subcloning it initially into pBluescriptII KS− (Stratagene), excising it by digestion withKpnI and SacI and ligating it to these same restriction cleavage sites within the β-globin-luciferase plasmids to generate β106HS2 and β340HS2. Plasmid γluc contains the humanAγ-globin gene promoter from, −260 to +35, fused to the luciferase coding region of pGL3Basic (Promega), and plasmid γHS2 has in addition the KpnI to BglII DNA fragment (HUMHBB positions 7764–9218) containing HS2 (47Lam L. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). γHX and BX contain the HindIII-XbaI andBalI-XbaI fragments of HS2, respectively. Constructs containing the human MAREs or multimers of the HS2 E box were made by inserting oligonucleotides, listed below, that had flanking sequence to allow directional cloning (via HindIII and SpeI sites) into either the ε- or β-luciferase vectors. Beginning with theHindIII-XbaI fragment containing the human HS2 core cloned into pBluescript II KS− (pBSHS2HX), the desired deletion fragments were obtained by restriction digestion or PCR amplification and cloned into pBSε-luciferase.4 (48Jackson J.D. Petrykowska H. Philipsen S. Miller W. Hardison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11871-11878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 5′ deletion series contained four constructs: BX (BalI to XbaI), MX (Mares to XbaI), 8701X, and 8762X; the 5′ ends are at HUMHBB positions 8568, 8658, 8701, and 8762 (respectively), and all 3′ ends are at 8860. The 3′ deletion series contained four constructs: H8750 (HindIII-8750), HCAC (HindIII-CAC), H8650 (HindIII-8650), and HB (HindIII-BalI); the 3′ ends are at HUMHBB positions 8750, 8687, 8651, and 8568 (respectively), and all 5′ ends are at 8486. The BX fragment of HS2 was directionally cloned into the εluc plasmid by excising it from pBSHS2HX with MscI and PstI and ligating it into εluc at SmaI and PstI sites to generate εluc-Bal-Xba. The BX fragment was also inserted into the β106 luciferase expression plasmid by excising it from εluc-Bal-Xba withPstI and SpeI, cloning it into pBluescriptIIKS− at the same restriction sites, excising again with SacI andBssHII, and ligating it into SacI andMluI sites in the β106 plasmid. The other fragments were amplified by PCR using the following primers (sequences are listed below): MX by primers “human MAREs” and T7; 8701X by primers 8701/BamHI and T7; 8762X by primers 8762 and T7; H8750 by primers 8750/PstI and T3; HCAC by primers CAC/PstI and T3; H8650 by primers 8650/PstI and T3; HBalI by primers BalI and T3. The resulting PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes to allow directional cloning into pBSε-luciferase.4. Three deletions between the HindIII and BalI restriction sites were generated that corresponded at their 5′ ends to conserved sequences within the HS2 core. The template for amplification was the pBSHS2HX vector. All three constructs in this deletion series had the same sequences at their 3′ end, generated by using the T3 primer of pBluescript. PCR products were prepared for subcloning into the β106-luciferase vector by digestion with restriction endonucleases.KpnI was introduced in the sequence of the forward primer, and SacI is found in the polylinker between the 3′ end of the HS2 core and the T3 primer. The sequence of the top strand of the duplex oligonucleotides used in cloning or the single-stranded oligonucleotide used for PCR are as follows. 8701 E box multimer, agctAGGCTGAGAACATCT GGGCACTAAGGCTGAGAACATCTGGGCACTAAGGCTGAGAACATCTGGGCACTAAGGCTGAGAACATCTGGGCACTAAGGCTGAGAACATCTGGGCA; human MAREs, ctagATGCTGAGTCATGATGAGTCATG; rabbit MAREs, ctagCAGTGCTGAGTCATGCTGAGTCATGTTGAGTCATGCTG; 8701/BamHI, caggatccGTGCCCAGATGTTCTCAG; 8762, ctagAGGGCAGATGGCAA; 8750/PstI, aactgcagCCTGTAAGCATCCTGCTG; CAC/PstI aactgcagGGCACACACCCTAAGC; 8650 gatcTTGCTGTGCTTGAGC; BalI, agctCTGGCCAGAACTGCTC; CR2, atggtaccTTAGTTCCTGTTACATTT; CR3, atggtaccGTGTCTCCATTAGTGACC; CR4, atggtaccTCCCATAGTCCAAG.

Using cationic lipids to deliver DNA to erythroid cells lines for transient expression, we were surprised to find that the effects of HS2 on enhancement were quite modest in MEL cells. A series of luciferase reporter gene plasmids (Fig. 1 A), driven by promoters from either the rabbit embryonic HBE gene or the mouse fetal/adult Hbb-b1 gene (encoding the β-major globin), were transfected into MEL and K562 cells at increasing concentrations of DNA to find optimal conditions for enhancement. Comparison of the resulting luciferase activities between plasmids with and without the HS2 core shows the expected robust enhancement by HS2 for both theHBE and the Hbb-b1 promoters in K562 cells (50- and 30-fold in this experiment, Fig. 1, B and C). However, enhancement in MEL cells is substantially lower, being only 12- and 3-fold for the HBE and Hbb-b1 promoters, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). Although the measured fold enhancement varies in different experiments, comparisons of transfections done at the same time invariably show a lower level of enhancement in MEL than in K562 cells. Also, as will be shown later, this modest effect of the HS2 core in MEL cells is seen in several different transfection protocols. Furthermore, a similar response from the promoters of rabbit, mouse, or human globin genes to enhancers containing fragments of the human HS2 core suggests that species-specific effects are not evident. The data in Fig. 1 show that the transfected plasmid templates were active, even in cells in which the endogenous homologous genes are inactive. In particular, the plasmid with an HBE promoter without an enhancer is as active in MEL cells, which do not produce εy-globin from the endogenous Hbb-y locus, as in K562 cells, which produce ε-globin from the endogenousHBE gene (800 RLU/s in K562 and 500 RLU/s in MEL). However, the response to the HS2 core was considerably lower in transiently transfected MEL cells. Likewise, the plasmid with an Hbb-b1promoter responded better to the HS2 core enhancer in K562 cells, where the endogenous homolog HBB is inactive, than in MEL cells. The Hbb-b1 promoter used for the data in Fig. 1 Cextended to nucleotide position −340 (with respect to the cap), and thus contained some sequences implicated in negative regulation of this gene (59Antoniou M. deBoer E. Habets G. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 60Macleod K. Plumb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4324-4332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of these negative elements did not restore enhancement in MEL cells, since the Hbb-b1 promoter extending only to −106 still showed a 6-fold reduction in enhancement in MEL cells compared with K562 cells (Fig. 1 D). Thus, these results indicate that the reduced enhancement in MEL cells is not related to the type of globin gene promoter used or the activity of the endogenous homologous genes. The limited enhancement by the HS2 core in MEL cells is not an artifact of using only parts of the genes. The plasmid ε-luc (Fig.1 A) was designed to include almost all of the HBEgene (57Hardison R.

To identify essential domains required for EKLF transactivation function, we cotransfected a human erythroleukemia cell line (K562) with a locus control region γ/Luc-β/Cat reporter and an EKLF expression vector. In this assay EKLF mediates a 500-fold induction of β/CAT expression compared with controls. To map essential transactivation domains, progressive NH2-terminal and internal deletion mutants of EKLF were constructed. All EKLF mutants were expressed at wild-type levels, localized to the nucleus, and bound DNA. When mutant EKLF proteins were tested for β/CAT activation, a novel transactivation domain was identified. This novel domain, encompassing amino acids (aa) 140–358, is sufficient for maximal β/CAT activation. An 85-amino acid subdomain within this region (aa 140–225) is essential for its activity. Interestingly, this central transactivation subdomain is functionally redundant with the amino-terminal domain (aa 1–139).

W., Majerus, P., and Varmus, H. (eds) (1994) The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases, W. B. Saunders Company,PhiladelphiaGoogle Scholar). Expression is exclusive to erythroid tissues, and ε-, γ-, and β-globin gene expression is predominately restricted to the yolk sac, fetal liver, and bone marrow, respectively. The genes are present within a 100-kb1locus that contains a potent 22-kb enhancer termed the locus control region (LCR) (2Townes T.M. Behringer R.R.

Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 304-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Several groups have proposed that precise tissue and developmental regulation is accomplished by complex protein-protein interactions between factors that bind the LCR and those that bind the promoters of individual genes (6Behringer R.R.

Stamatoyannopoulos G. Nature. 1990; 344: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The competition model suggests that a number of erythroid-specific and ubiquitous factors bind the LCR and enable this region to function as a potent enhancer. Downstream genes then compete for productive interactions with the LCR (2Townes T.M. Behringer R.R.

Presumably, yolk sac-, fetal liver-, and bone marrow-specific factors bind to globin gene promoters and proximal enhancers and provide individual genes with a competitive advantage for interaction with the LCR at the appropriate developmental stage. Erythroid Kruppel-like Factor (EKLF) is one factor that is critical for the developmental stage-specific switch from the γ- to β-globin expression (reviewed in Ref. 8Perkins A. Int. J. Biochem.

EKLF is a 358-amino acid protein containing an amino-terminal, proline-rich transactivation region (aa 1–275) and a COOH-terminal DNA binding domain (aa 276–358) (10Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell.

Although EKLF also binds to the CACCC box in the γ promoter, the binding affinity to γ CACCC is 8-fold lower than the binding affinity for β CACCC and EKLF preferentially activates the β gene in transient transfection assays (12Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of EKLF in mice results in a drastic reduction in the β-globin gene expression, but γ gene expression remains unaffected (13Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 14Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Finally, persistence of γ gene expression during development is observed in EKLF knockout mice (15Perkins A.C. Gaensler K.M. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12267-12271Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the view that EKLF plays a central role in γ- to β-globin gene switching by binding specifically to the β promoter and providing a competitive advantage for interactions with the LCR in adult erythroid tissue. Recent studies also suggest that EKLF exerts important functions at sites other than the β-globin promoter (17Perkins A.C. Peterson K.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Witkowska H.E. Orkin S.H. Blood. 2000; 95: 1827-1833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Guy L.G. Delvoye N. Wall L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3675-3680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although a large amount of information suggests a critical role for EKLF in globin gene switching, the mechanisms underlying EKLF transactivation functions are not clearly understood. EKLF is expressed, and is functional at all developmental stages, yet its effects are apparent only during definitive hematopoiesis (19Guy L.G. Mei Q. Perkins A.C. Orkin S.H. Wall L. Blood. 1998; 91: 2259-2263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Southwood C.M. Downs K.M. Bieker J.J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Tewari R. Gillemans N. Wijgerde M. Nuez B. von Lindern M. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2334-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this specificity is unknown. The dissection of EKLF functional domains is an important step in elucidating these mechanisms. Previous studies have localized a transactivation domain at the amino-terminal region (aa 1–104) (22Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification of a new transactivation domain. This domain, consisting of amino acids 140–358, is sufficient for maximal transactivation of the β-globin promoter. Furthermore, an essential region within this domain (aa 140–225) is completely redundant with the amino-terminal transactivation domain (aa 1–139). The HA-EKLF plasmid was constructed by subcloning a 63-base pair double-stranded oligomer (top: 5′-CATGGGTAGCAGCTACCCTTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCAGCCTGGGCGGCCCTAGCAGAGG-3′; bottom: 5′-CATGCCCCTGCTAGGGCCGCCCAGGCTGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAAGGGTAGCTGCTACC-3′) encompassing the HA epitope at the NcoI site of the EKLF expression plasmid pSG5/EKLF (10Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). This HA-EKLF plasmid was used as the parental plasmid for the generation of deletion mutants. Restriction enzymes PvuII and Bpu10I cut in EKLF cDNA at positions corresponding to codon 3. Restriction enzymesBsaI, NarI, and AvaI cut at positions corresponding to codons 139, 225, and 254, respectively. Restriction enzyme SmaI cuts at positions corresponding to codons 155 and 255. Mutant HA-Δ4–139 was generated by ligating three fragments as follows: a 0.7-kb AvrII-PvuII fragment, a 0.8-kb BsaI-BamHI fragment (BsaI end was blunted by S1 nuclease), and a 3.3-kbBamHI-AvrII fragment. Mutant HA-Δ4–225 was generated by digesting HA-EKLF plasmid with Bpu10I andNarI. The Bpu10I end was blunted with Klenow, and the NarI end was blunted with S1. The 4.6-kbBpu10I(blunt)-NarI(blunt) fragment was gel-purified and self-ligated. Mutant HA-Δ4–254 was generated by digesting the HA-EKLF plasmid with Bpu10I andAvaI. The Bpu10I end was blunted with Klenow, and the AvaI end was blunted with S1. The 4.6-kbBpu10I(blunt)-AvaI(blunt) fragment was gel purified and self-ligated. Mutant HA-Δ140–226 was generated by ligating two fragments: a 1.2-kb AvrII-BsaI fragment (the BsaI end was blunted with Klenow), and a 3.7-kb NarI-AvrII fragment (the Nar1 end was blunted with Klenow). Mutant HA-Δ255–358 was generated by digesting the HA-EKLF plasmid with SmaI andBamHI. The BamHI end was blunted with Klenow. The 4.6-kb SmaI-BamHI(blunt) fragment was gel-purified and ligated with the 300-base pair SmaI fragment (codons 155–255) from EKLF cDNA. All constructs were sequenced and purified twice on cesium chloride gradients. K562 cells were grown and electroporated as described previously (12Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with different mutants along with CMV-Lac-Z using the calcium chloride coprecipitation method. Forty-eight hours after transfection, nuclear extracts were prepared (23Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar), and Western blots were performed using ∼50 μg of nuclear extracts that were normalized by β-gal activity. The anti-HA antibody 12CA5-HRP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at a 1:2500 dilution, and gels were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transactivation assays were performed as described previously (12Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Each construct was tested in at least three independent experiments. Within each experiment, each construct was electroporated in duplicate. CAT assays were performed in duplicate on each electroporated sample, and β-gal assays were performed in triplicate on each electroporated sample. The CAT assay values were normalized by β-gal values. Indirect immunofluorescence was conducted as described previously (24Shiio Y. Itoh M. Inoue J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), except that the cells were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min after the permeabilization step. Coverslips were mounted in media containing propidium iodide (Vector Laboratories). 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (generous gift of Dr. Susan Ruppert) was used (1:500 dilution) as the primary antibody, and a FITC anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz) was used as the secondary antibody (1:500 dilution). Images were captured with a Hamamatsu 3CDC camera mounted on a Nikon eclipse E800 microscope. COS cell nuclear extracts that were normalized by β-gal activity (∼20 μg) as described above were used in gel shift assays using a double-stranded oligomer encompassing the mammalian β promoter CACCC box (8Perkins A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1175-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The binding reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, and 1% Ficoll. Before loading the sample on the gel, a 0.1 volume of 20% Ficoll was added to each reaction. For supershift/ablation assays, HA antibody was included in the binding reaction. We performed a mutational analysis of EKLF using a previously established transient transfection assay (12Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) to map essential transactivation domains. The transactivation assay utilizes the human erythroid cell line K562, which expresses little endogenous EKLF (12Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and an LCR γ-β reporter (HS2-γ/Luc-β/Cat) that contains wild-type human γ- and β-globin promoters (Fig.1). In this assay, full-length EKLF activates β/CAT expression 500-fold compared with vector alone; therefore, the system provides a sensitive, quantitative assay for transactivation domains. We first tagged EKLF at the NH2terminus with the influenza HA epitope (HA-EKLF) to allow detection of the protein in transfected cells. HA-EKLF transactivated the β-globin promoter in the HS2-γ/Luc-β/Cat reporter at the same level (500-fold) as wild-type EKLF. Using this parental plasmid, we constructed three progressive amino-terminal truncations of HA-EKLF: HA-Δ4–139 that deletes amino acids 4 through 139, HA-Δ4–225 that deletes amino acids 4 through 225, and HA-Δ4–254 that deletes amino acids 4 through 254 (Fig. 2 A). The same methionine start site was retained for all mutants to avoid differences in the site of translation initiation. As an added control, untagged versions of each mutant were also produced and tested in the same assay; no differences between HA-tagged and untagged proteins were observed (data not shown).Figure 2Deletion mapping of the transactivation domain. A, schematic of HA-EKLF deletion constructs. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) is shown as a solid box, and the HA tag is shown as a stripped box. B, histogram of transactivation results. The HS2 γ/Luc-β/Cat reporter was cotransfected with either vector alone, full-length, or deletion mutants of HA-EKLF, and CMV-Lac-Z into K562 cells. CAT activities were normalized to β-galactosidase levels. Full-length HA-EKLF activated β/CAT levels 500-fold relative to the vector alone and is depicted as 100%. The transactivation capacities of the mutants are shown as percentage of wild-type HA-EKLF activity. The error bars denote S.E. of at least three independent experiments. The values for each construct are as follows: vector, 0.2 ± 0.07%; HA-Δ4–139, 99 ± 21%; HA-Δ4–225, 2.9 ± 2%; HA-Δ4–254, 1 ± 0.6%; HA-Δ140–226, 95 ± 23%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Each deletion construct was cotransfected with the LCR γ-β reporter and Lac-Z control and tested for the ability to transactivate the β-globin promoter. The results are depicted in Fig. 2 B. In these experiments full-length HA-EKLF (WT) activated the β-globin promoter 500-fold relative to the vector alone and is depicted as 100%. The activities of different mutants are expressed as a percentage of WT. Surprisingly, HA-Δ4–139 activated the β promoter at wild-type levels (99 ± 21%) even though this deletion removed the transactivation domain previously identified by Chen and Bieker (amino acids 1–104) (22Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A further 85 amino acid deletion (HA-Δ4–225) drastically reduced β/CAT activation to 2.9 ± 2%. Deletion to amino acid 255 (HA-Δ4–254) resulted in very low levels of β/CAT activation (1.0 ± 0.6%). These data demonstrate that amino acids 140–358 encompass a potent transactivation domain that is sufficient for maximal transactivation of the β-globin promoter. Furthermore, the results suggest that an 85-amino acid subdomain (amino acids 140–225) is critical for the function of this domain. To ensure proper integrity of the mutants, we first assessed EKLF protein levels after transfection into COS cells. Mutant constructs were cotransfected with a Lac-Z plasmid to control for transfection efficiency, and Western blots were conducted on normalized nuclear extracts using an anti-HA antibody. These results are illustrated in Fig. 3. All mutant EKLFs were detected at near wild-type levels, suggesting that the proteins were stable. We next assessed the subcellular localization of the mutants to determine whether the inactivity of HA-Δ4–225 and HA-Δ4–254 could be explained by protein mislocalization. Mutant constructs were transfected into COS cells, and HA-EKLFs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence with a FITC-labeled (green) anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4, A–E). Propidium iodide staining (red) was utilized to define the nucleus (Fig. 4, H–L), and a two-color merge (Fig. 4,O–S) was used to assess EKLF nuclear localization. As illustrated in the figure, all mutant EKLFs localized to the nucleus. These data suggest that the transcriptional inactivity of HA-Δ4–225 and HA-Δ4–254 does not result from protein mislocalization. Finally, we examined all mutant EKLFs for the ability to bind DNA. Gel shift assays were performed with nuclear extracts obtained from COS cells following transfection of the HA constructs described above. The binding sequence was a labeled oligomer (20 base pairs) encompassing the mammalian β-globin CACCC site (Fig.5). Control extracts from cells transfected with the vector alone are shown in lanes 2 and3. The background bands result from endogenous proteins that are known to bind the CACCC motif (8Perkins A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1175-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); as expected, HA antibody does not ablate or supershift these bands. Lanes 4 and5 represent extracts from cells transfected with full-length HA-EKLF. Unfortunately, the EKLF gel shift band is obscured by a background band and, therefore, cannot be detected. However, unique gel shift bands that are distinct from endogenous bands are detected for all deletion mutants. Lanes 6, 8, and10 represent extracts from cells transfected with EKLF mutants HA-Δ4–139, HA-Δ4–225, and HA-Δ4–254, respectively. Specific bands that migrate at the predicted size are observed in each of these lanes. These data demonstrate that all mutant EKLFs bind DNA. To confirm that unique bands are EKLF-specific gel shifts, HA antibody was included in the binding reactions. Lanes 7,9, and 11 demonstrate that HA antibody specifically ablates HA-Δ4–139, HA-Δ4–225, and HA-Δ4–254 gel shifts. We conclude that all EKLF mutants bind DNA and, therefore, that the transcriptional inactivity of HA-Δ4–225 and HA-Δ4–254 results from deletion of a novel transactivation domain. The results described above demonstrate that amino acids 4 to 139 of EKLF are dispensable for maximal activation of the β-globin promoter, although this region encompasses the minimal activation domain described by Chen and Bieker (22Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that different systems were utilized to define transactivation domains. Chen and Bieker (22Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) used a GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to EKLF and tested the ability of fusion proteins to activate a heterologous target promoter (GAL4 binding sites-TATA-CAT) in 32DEpo1 cells. On the other hand, we utilized native EKLF and the natural β-globin promoter in K562 cells. To determine whether the amino-terminal domain of EKLF would transactivate in our assay, we constructed a new mutant, HA-Δ140–226 (Fig.2 A), that essentially fuses the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–139) to the transcriptionally inactive mutant HA-Δ4–225. We then tested the ability of this protein to transactivate the β-globin promoter in our HS2-γ/Luc-β/Cat reporter (Fig.2 B). Interestingly, this mutant activated the β promoter at WT levels (95 ± 23%). This result confirms that the amino-terminal region of EKLF contains a potent transactivation domain as originally described by Chen and Bieker (22Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our data demonstrate that this amino-terminal domain is functionally redundant with the domain at aa 140–225. As expected, the HA-Δ140–226 EKLF protein is stable (Fig. 3), localizes to the nucleus (Fig. 4 panels F, M, and T), and binds DNA (Fig. 5, lanes 12 and 13). The results described above identify a novel transactivation domain in the erythroid-specific transcription factor EKLF. This domain, which is contained within amino acids 140–358 of the protein, is sufficient for maximal transactivation of the β-globin promoter (see HA-Δ4–139, Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, an 85-amino acid subdomain of this region (aa 140–225) is essential for activity; deletion of this subdomain dramatically reduces transactivation (HA-Δ4–225, Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, this subdomain can be functionally replaced by amino acids 1–139 (HA-Δ140–226, Fig.2 B), which contains a potent transactivation domain described by Chen and Bieker (22Chen X. Bieker J.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that EKLF possesses at least two transactivation domains that function in a redundant manner. In this respect, EKLF is similar to another Kruppel-like family member, Sp1, which also contains two potent transactivation domains that are functionally redundant (25Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Mutant constructs designed to delimit subregions within the 85-amino acid central domain (aa 140–225) produced unstable proteins (data not shown), precluding further definition of this domain. Our results also demonstrate that amino acids 255–358 encompass sequences sufficient for nuclear localization; the HA-Δ4–254 EKLF mutant efficiently localized to the nucleus (Fig. 4,panels E, L, and S), although the protein did not activate transcription. To confirm this result we generated a new construct HA-Δ255–358 that deletes amino acids 255–358. This mutant was expressed at WT levels in whole cell extracts (data not shown). When tested for subcellular compartmentalization, the mutant localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, panels G, N, and U). This result demonstrates that the first 254 aa of EKLF do not contain a nuclear localization sequence. The best candidate for the nuclear localization sequence is PKRSRR at position 260–265. This sequence is highly homologous to the nuclear localization sequence (PKRGRR) identified in other Kruppel-like family members (26Shields J.M. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18504-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for transactivation through the newly identified, central domain of EKLF is not known. However, some insight can be obtained from studies of the amino-terminal domain. The activity of this domain is regulated by phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue within the recognition site of casein kinase-II (27Ouyang L. Chen X. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23019-23025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). EKLF is heavily phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, and several consensus sites for phosphorylation are present within the central domain (27Ouyang L. Chen X. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23019-23025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); therefore, the activity of this region may also be regulated by phosphorylation. Alternatively, transactivation may be a function of the proline-rich nature of this region. The activation domains of several transcription factors are rich in prolines (28Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), and previous studies have demonstrated that a proline stretch of 10 residues is sufficient to confer high transactivation capacity when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (29Gerber H.P. Seipel K. Georgiev O. Hofferer M. Hug M. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Science. 1994; 263: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The entire EKLF protein is rich in prolines, except for the zinc finger domain (aa 275–358); therefore, both the amino-terminal and central domains may function through proline-rich sequences. The redundancy of amino-terminal and central domains could be achieved in several ways. Both domains may interact independently with the same coactivator. This has been observed for the two redundant Sp1 activation domains, both of which interact with the same coactivator, TAFII110 (a component of the TFIID complex) (30Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O. Gill G. Chen J.L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the two domains may interact with different coactivators that have redundant activities. Previous studies have demonstrated that EKLF interacts physically with CBP, P300, and P/CAF in vivo, and GATA-1 in vitro (31Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 32Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Armstrong et al. (33Armstrong J.A. Bieker J.J. Emerson B.M. Cell. 1998; 95: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) recently purified the SWI/SNF-related complex E-RC 1 based on its ability to interact functionally with EKLF in vitro. Additional experiments will be required to define the coactivators that interact with each EKLF transactivation domain. As mentioned above, EKLF is phosphorylated extensively, and Zhang and Bieker (31Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that specific lysines are acetylated (Lys261, Lys270). These post-translational modifications may promote interactions with specific coactivators and factors of the basal transcription machinery. Differential post-translational modifications of the two transactivation domains during development may provide a mechanism for the temporal-specific transcriptional activity of EKLF on the β-globin promoter, and identification of additional EKLF interacting proteins should provide insights into globin gene switching.

https://openalex.org/W2109687907,"The FILAMENTOUS FLOWER gene fromArabidopsis thaliana is a member of a gene family whose role is to specify abaxial cell fate in lateral organs. Analysis of the amino-terminal region of the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein suggests that seven cysteine residues at positions 14, 26, 30, 33, 54, 56, and 57, and two histidine residues at positions 18 and 24 contribute to a putative zinc finger motif, Cys-X 3-His-X 5-His-X-Cys-X 3-Cys-X 2-Cys-X 20-Cys-X-Cys-Cys. Zinc determination experiments revealed that the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein binds two zinc ions per molecule. Chemical modification was required to release one zinc ion, whereas the other was released spontaneously or more rapidly in the presence of metallochromic indicator. The loss of a zinc ion and the subsequent structural change of the zinc finger domain were correlated with the multimerization of the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein. A cysteine residue at position 56 in the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein potentially interferes with zinc ligation within the zinc finger and causes this zinc release. In support of this, substitution of the Cys56 by alanine suppressed both the zinc release and the multimerization of the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein. Deletion analysis showed that the region between positions 45 and 107 functions in the intermolecular contacts between FILAMENTOUS FLOWER proteins. This region corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal half of the zinc finger domain and the following hydrophobic region containing two putative α-helices. Our results suggest that the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein forms a range of different conformers. This attribute may lead to a greater degree of functional flexibility that is central to its role as an abaxial cell fate regulator.

These investigations suggest that normal juxtaposition of factors regulating abaxial and adaxial fate is necessary for normal organ growth and may feed-back to support the maintenance of the apical meristem (2Sawa S.

It has been thought that theFILAMENTOUS FLOWER(FIL)1 gene has a role in the formation and development of floral meristems and determination of the numbers of floral organs (5Okada K. Shimura Y. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1357-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Sawa S. Ito T. Shimura Y. Okada K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently, it is proposed that the FIL gene is a member of a gene family whose role appears to be pivotal in specifying the abaxial cell fate of lateral organs (3Siegfried K.R. Eshed Y. Baum S.F. Otsuga D. Drews G.N. Bowman J.L. Development. 1999; 126: 4117-4128PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to FIL, this gene family consists of six members, including the flower specific genesCRABS CLAW (CRC) (7Bowman J.L. Smyth D.R. Development. 1999; 126: 2387-2396PubMed Google Scholar), INNER NO OUTER(INO) (8Villanueva J.M. Broadhvest J. Hauser B.A. Meister R.J. Schneitz K. Gasser C.S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3160-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and YABBY2 (YAB2),YABBY3 (YAB3), and YABBY5(YAB5) (3Siegfried K.R. Eshed Y. Baum S.F. Otsuga D. Drews G.N. Bowman J.L. Development. 1999; 126: 4117-4128PubMed Google Scholar). YAB2, YAB3, andFIL are expressed abaxially in all developing lateral organs and are proposed to redundantly promote the abaxial fate of all lateral organs in the plant (2Sawa S. Watanabe K. Goto K. Liu Y.G. Shibata D. Kanaya E. Morita E.H. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 3Siegfried K.R. Eshed Y. Baum S.F. Otsuga D. Drews G.N. Bowman J.L. Development. 1999; 126: 4117-4128PubMed Google Scholar). The putative proteins encoded by this gene family share amino-terminal zinc finger and carboxyl-terminal HMG-box like domains (2Sawa S. Watanabe K. Goto K. Liu Y.G. Shibata D. Kanaya E. Morita E.H. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 3Siegfried K.R. Eshed Y. Baum S.F. Otsuga D. Drews G.N. Bowman J.L. Development. 1999; 126: 4117-4128PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of these domains suggests that these genes may function as transcriptional regulators. Consistent with this, the FIL protein has been shown to contain a zinc ion and be localized to the nucleus (2Sawa S. Watanabe K. Goto K. Liu Y.G. Shibata D. Kanaya E. Morita E.H. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that, in addition to DNA binding, zinc fingers can work in protein·protein interactions supporting the formation of homo- and heterodimers as well as protein self-association (9Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This suggests the aspects that the protein function of FIL and other members of this gene family may be mediated through protein·protein interactions. Several sequence motifs have been observed to accompany the zinc finger domain when they act in protein·protein interactions. These motifs include the Kruppel-associated box (10Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), the poxvirus zinc finger domain (11Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), and the SCAN domain (12Williams A.J. Blacklow S.C. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). GATA family proteins are also capable of protein·protein interactions (13Mackay J.P. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30560-30567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Nuclear bodies containing large assemblies of GATA proteins have been observed by confocal microscopy (14Elefancy A.G. Antoniou M. Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Grosvelt F.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among many zinc finger families, the LIM domain contains double zinc finger structures that mediate specific contacts between proteins participating in the formation of a multiprotein complex (15Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The LIM motif displays the consensus amino acid sequence Cys-X 2-Cys-X 16–23-His-X 2-Cys-X 2-Cys-X 2-Cys-X 16–23-Cys-X 2-Cys (where X is any amino acid (16Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar)), and spectroscopic studies of some LIM domains have revealed that they coordinate two zinc ions (17Michelsen J.W.

A. 1994; 91: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The RING finger domain contains eight conserved metal ligands with similar spacing to those in the LIM motif (consensus motif Cys-X 2-Cys-X 9–39-Cys-X 1–3-His-X 2–3-Cys -X 2-Cys-X 4–48-Cys-X 2-Cys (16Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar)) and binds two zinc atoms per molecule in a cross-brace arrangement. The FIL zinc finger domain occurs between positions 10 and 60 of the FIL protein, near the amino terminus. In this study, we investigated the FIL protein focusing on the zinc finger domain. We found that the zinc finger motif of FIL, Cys-X 3-His-X 5-His-X-Cys-X 3-Cys -X 2-Cys-X 20-Cys-X-Cys-Cys, is potentially an analogue of the LIM finger motif and that this domain readily changes conformation and is involved in the self-association of the FIL protein. FIL is thought to act as a transcriptional regulator in the plant, but the molecular basis of its action has yet to be demonstrated. We discuss the possibility that structural variability of the FIL protein due to the changing conformation of the zinc finger domain may be central to its molecular and biological action. Plasmid pET28a and Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were from Novagen, Inc. Plasmid pGEX-2T was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Competent cells of E. coli JM109 (recA1, endA1, gyra96,thi-1, hsdR17, supE44,relA1,Δ(lac-proAB)/F[traD36,proAB +, lacI q,lacZΔM15]) for plasmid construction were from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. The proteins used as standards for gel filtration were from Bio-Rad. A prestained protein marker for Western blotting was from New England BioLabs. DNA oligomers were synthesized by Sawady Technology Co., Ltd. The GelCode 6xHis protein tag staining kit and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP-HCl) were from Pierce. 4-(2-Pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) andp-hydroxymercuriphenyl sulfonate (PMPS) were from Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemicals. Other chemicals were of reagent grade. The FILgene has been isolated as described previously (2Sawa S. Watanabe K. Goto K. Liu Y.G. Shibata D. Kanaya E. Morita E.H. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The gene was amplified by PCR using the synthetic DNA oligomers P1 (5′-ATGTCGTCCATGGCCTCCCCTTCCTCAGCTG-3′) and P2 (5′-TTTATCCTCGAGATAAGGAGTCACACCAACG-3′) as primers. Recognition sites of restriction endonucleases NcoI andXhoI are shown by the two underlined areas, respectively. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed using a Trio-Thermoblock (Biometra) apparatus with KOD DNA polymerase and using the procedures recommended by the supplier. The DNA product was digested with NcoI and XhoI, and ligated to the large NcoI-XhoI fragment of plasmid pET28a to generate plasmid pETFIL, in which the FIL gene, encoding FIL-(6–229) with a histidine tag at a carboxyl terminus, is under the control of bacteriophage T7 transcription and translation signals. Mutation of Cys56 to Ala was generated by overlap PCR. Two initial PCRs were performed with primers P1 and P3 (5′-GATTGGTACAAGCACCACATCGG-3′) and P2 and P4 (5′-CCGATGTGGTGCTTGTACCAATC-3′), where the substituted residues are underlined. The amplified DNA fragments were purified, and a second PCR was carried out with primers P1 and P2. The sequences of the wild-type and mutant FIL genes in pETFIL were confirmed by cycle sequencing using the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kits and ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Truncation of the FIL gene was performed via PCR with the synthetic DNA oligomers carrying BamHI andEcoRI sites as primers, and using KOD DNA polymerase, according the procedures recommended by the supplier. The DNA product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated to the large BamHI-EcoRI fragment of plasmid pGEX-2T, thereby creating in-frame fusion with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene. The nucleotide sequences of the truncated FIL genes were confirmed as described above. Expression of the FIL protein was induced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the plasmid pETFIL by the addition of IPTG in the presence of 10 μm zinc acetate. Cultivation of the E. colitransformants was carried out as described previously (2Sawa S. Watanabe K. Goto K. Liu Y.G. Shibata D. Kanaya E. Morita E.H. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and subjected to the purification procedures described below. The production of the FIL protein in cells was examined by analyzing the whole-cell extract by sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). The solubility of FIL in cells was examined as described previously (23Kanaya E. Nakajima N. Morikawa K. Okada K. Shimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16068-16076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Cells from 1-liter culture were suspended in 50 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, sonicated on ice for 3 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (27,000 × g) for 30 min. EDTA (0.1 mm) was added to remove the zinc ions, which bind nonspecifically to the protein. The resulting supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C for 4 h. The dialyzed solution was applied to a HiTrap chelating column with Ni2+ ions from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. After the column was washed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaSCN, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.6% sodium deoxycholate (DOC), and 10% glycerol), the FIL protein was eluted with buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. The eluant was applied to Superose 12 PC 3.2/30 in a SMART system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech equilibrated with buffer A. The elution of the FIL protein was performed with a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 4 °C. The purity of the purified FIL protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Zinc release experiments were performed as described previously (24Pizzi S. Dieci G. Frigeri P. Piccoli G. Stocchi V. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2539-2548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The protein solution was dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 μm TCEP, 0.6% DOC, and 10% glycerol to remove β-mercaptoethanol. To the mixture of 0.2 mm PMPS and 0.1 mm PAR in buffer B (30 mm Hepes-Na, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 0.35 mNaCl), the wild-type or mutant FIL protein was added to a final concentration of 2 μm. Then, absorbance changes at 500 nm were measured every 2 min. Zinc release from FIL was determined indirectly by monitoring the formation of a (PAR)2·Zn2+ complex (ε500 = 66,000 cm−1m−1) (25Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Schachman H.K. Ginsburg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14793-14803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc release in the presence of PAR only was also similarly analyzed by measuring the absorbance change at 500 nm. Mercaptide bond formation was directly followed at 250 nm. CD spectra (200–260 nm) were measured on a J-720 automatic spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd.). Spectra were obtained using solutions containing the FIL proteins at 0.3 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The EDTA-treated samples were prepared by incubating the FIL protein solution with 10 mmEDTA for 1 h at 20 °C, followed by the removal of excess EDTA with a 20-h dialysis. The mean residue ellipticity [θ], expressed in units of deg·cm2·dmol−1, was calculated by using an average amino acid molecular weight of 110. The helical content of the protein was calculated by the method of Wu et al. (26Wu C.-S.C. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of FIL with a tag was determined from the UV absorption at 280 nm. The A 2800.1% value of 0.62 for FIL-(6–229) with a molecular weight of 26,305, was calculated by using 1,576 m−1·cm−1 for tyrosine (7×) and 5,225 m−1·cm−1 for tryptophan (1×) at 280 nm (27Goodwin T.W. Morton R.A. Biochem. J. 1946; 40: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). GST-FIL fusion proteins were prepared and adsorbed to the glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (13Mackay J.P. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Czolij R. King G.F. Crossley M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30560-30567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The beads containing the GST-FIL fusion protein were incubated with the purified FIL-(6–229) by the Ni2+ resin in 5-fold-diluted buffer A at 4 °C. After 7 days, the beads were collected and washed five times by the same buffer. The bound material was then released by boiling in SDS loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis and Western blotting. The presence of retained FIL-(6–229) with a histidine tag was detected using a nickel-activated derivative of horseradish peroxidase (India HisProbe-HRP). The secondary structure of FIL was predicted using a neural network system that was offered as a service on the Predict Protein Server on the Web. The program was provided by Rost and Sander (28Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2658) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of FIL was examined for similarity to known protein sequences by BLASTP (29Zhang Z. Schaffer A.A. Miller W. Madden T.L. Lipman D.J. Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3986-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and the sequence alignment was performed by ClustalW (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56228) Google Scholar). Both were available on the Web. Expression of theFIL gene in the plasmid pETFIL was induced in E. coli by the addition of IPTG as described previously (2Sawa S. Watanabe K. Goto K. Liu Y.G. Shibata D. Kanaya E. Morita E.H. Okada K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The cultivation of the transformants was performed at 30 °C to obtain the FIL protein in soluble form. Five amino acid residues at the amino terminus of FIL were removed to avoid the heterogeneity of the expressed protein. FIL-(6–229) was efficiently and selectively trapped by the chelating column when a histidine tag was attached to the carboxyl terminus. Elution with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaSCN, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.6% DOC, and 10% glycerol) containing 100 mm imidazole yielded 2.0 mg of protein product containing FIL from 1 liter of culture, which was identified as a single band using SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). When the FIL protein purification was performed in the absence of solubilizers and dissociating agents, the FIL protein formed a precipitate. This phenomenon prevented both the characterization and further increase in the concentration of the FIL protein. Changing pH and the addition of glycerol, Triton X-100, octylglycoside, CHAPS, and NaCl failed to prevent the formation of this precipitate, but the addition of 0.55m arginine and 0.44 m sucrose did (31Armstrong N. de Lencastre A. Gouaux E. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, gel filtration of the FIL protein using Superose 12 was performed at pH 5.5 in the presence of arginine and sucrose. The elution profile showed that all the FIL protein formed a multimer, which was eluted out with a void volume, and the peak corresponding to the FIL monomer was not observed (data not shown). This result suggests that more than twenty molecules of FIL assemble together as a multimer and cause FIL protein precipitation in the absence of the solubilizer. Among several dissociating agents examined to dissociate the multimer of the FIL protein, DOC (32Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar) and sodium thiocyanate (33Hochman J. Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Insel P.A. Krasny L. Melmon K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were most effective. Therefore, gel filtration was performed at pH 8.0 in the presence of 0.6% DOC and 0.1 m sodium thiocyanate. The elution profile showed two peaks that corresponded to the multimer eluted with the void volume (0.9 ml), and the FIL monomer protein eluted with a retention volume of 1.25 ml (Fig.1 a). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out to determine the molecular mass of this protein. Concentration versus radial distance profiles were obtained at three different rotor speeds (data not shown), and a nonlinear least squares analysis revealed that the data fit a simple single species model exhibiting a slight tendency for aggregation and a molecular mass of 27,100 ± 240 Da. This is very close to the theoretical mass of 26,305. When the FIL solution was applied to the column for gel filtration, immediately after recovery from the chelating column, the elution profile showed that the multimer and monomer forms of the FIL protein constituted 27 and 73% of the FIL protein, respectively (Fig. 1 b). A time course for the relative proportions of the FIL multimer and monomer forms were examined when the FIL protein with a total concentration of 2.0 mg/ml was kept in buffer A at pH 8.0 and 4 °C for 6 days. Fig. 1 b shows the decrease of the monomer and the increase of the multimer forms of the FIL protein observed over the 6-day period. The shift from the FIL monomer to the multimer form occurred gradually over this time. After 6 days, the monomer had decreased to 67% from 73%, conversely, the multimer increased to 33% from 27% (Fig. 1 b). After 30 days, the relative amount of the multimer was ∼70% and that of the monomer was ∼30% (data not shown). Lowering the pH of the buffer increased the multimerization of FIL, whereas dilution of the FIL solution diminished the multimerization (data not shown). The addition of EDTA to the FIL solution markedly enhanced the multimerization of FIL protein (Fig. 1, c and d). When the relative decrease of the monomer and the increase of the multimer in the presence of EDTA at 4 °C was monitored over 6 days (Fig. 1 d), the percentage of FIL monomer protein had decreased to 48% from 73% by the end of this period. Conversely, the percentage of FIL multimer protein had increased to 52% from 27% (Fig. 1 d). These results suggest that the formation of the FIL protein multimer could be related to a spontaneous release of a zinc ion from the FIL protein and that the addition of EDTA may enhance this process. We decided to examine the theoretical structure of the zinc finger domain of FIL to help investigate this possibility. The FIL protein has the amino-terminal C-rich structure with a CX 3HX 5HXCX 3CX 2CX 20CXCC (CH2C6) motif between positions 14 and 57 and the carboxyl-terminal HMG-box like domain for the potential DNA binding. The deduced amino acid sequence of the FIL protein was compared with those of the YAB2 and YAB3 proteins. Fig.2 shows the alignment of the three sequences. The zinc finger domain of the FIL protein has seven cysteine residues at positions 14, 26, 30, 33, 54, 56, and 57, and two histidine residues at positions 18 and 24 (CH2C6 motif) (Fig. 2). The zinc finger domain of the YAB2 protein has five cysteine residues at positions 11, 15, 18, 39, and 42, and two histidine residues at positions 14 and 41 (CHC3HC motif) (Fig. 2). The zinc finger domain of the YAB3 protein has five cysteine residues at positions 26, 30, 33, 54, and 57, and three histidine residues at positions 18, 29, and 56 (HCHC3HC motif) (Fig.2). The five cysteine residues at positions 26, 30, 33, 54, and 57 of the FIL protein are conserved in the three sequences (Fig. 2), and four cysteine residues at positions 30, 33, 54, and 57 are thought to be in the canonical positions for the zinc ligation. However, the cysteine residues at positions 14 and 56 of FIL are not conserved among the sequences of the three zinc finger domains shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, Cys56 was considered as a candidate residue for facilitating the observed zinc release from the FIL protein. To examine a possible role of the Cys56 in zinc ligation destabilization, alanine was substituted for cysteine at position 56 in the FIL protein. To examine a possible role of the Cys56 in zinc ligation destabilization, alanine was substituted for cysteine at position 56. The solution of the C56A mutant protein was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig.3 a). Immediately after the elution from the Ni2+ resin, the approximate percentage of the fil C56A multimer was 10% compared with 80% for the fil C56A monomer and 10% for the fil C56A oligomer (Fig. 3 b). This fil C56A oligomer was eluted with a retention volume of 1.09 ml, which was 0.16 ml smaller than that of the fil C56A monomer (1.25 ml) and 0.19 ml larger than that of the fil C56A multimer (0.9 ml) (Fig.3 a). The relative amount of the fil C56A multimer remained at 10% for 6 days (Fig. 3 b). These results differed markedly from comparable experiments with the wild-type FIL protein (Fig. 1 b), suggesting that the multimerization of the FIL protein is effectively suppressed by the substitution of Ala for Cys56. On the other hand, the monomer of fil C56A gradually decreased, with a commensurate, gradual increase in the concentration of the fil C56A oligomer over 6 days (Fig. 3 b). The formation of an oligomer was not observed in the elution profile of the wild-type protein (Fig. 1 a). As was observed for wild-type FIL protein, the addition of EDTA increased the amount of fil C56A multimer but the effect was less (Figs. 1 c, 1 d, 3 c, and 3 d). Moreover, it seems that the formation of the fil C56A oligomer was not influenced by EDTA (Fig. 3, b and d). This suggests that the fil C56A oligomer forms irrespective of whether there is zinc release from the zinc finger domain. Fig.4 shows the far-UV CD spectra of the wild-type FIL and fil C56A proteins at pH 8.5 and 20 °C. Both the spectra (Fig. 4, a and b) are very similar to each other, and the helical content of the protein was 14.3% for the wild-type protein, and 14.9% for the C56A mutant. The addition of 10 mm EDTA to both the wild-type FIL and fil C56A mutant proteins produced CD spectral changes and a decrease in the helical content. (12.0% for the wild-type protein, and 13.1% for the fil C56A protein). Notably, the decrease in the helical content of the wild-type (2.3%) was larger than that of C56A (1.8%), indicating that EDTA effected a greater structural change on the wild-type FIL protein than on the fil C56A mutant protein. These results suggest that the addition of EDTA may interfere with zinc ligation by the zinc finger in the wild-type FIL protein causing zinc release. Under this proposal the loss of zinc then results in structural changes in the FIL protein that increases its tendency for self-association and multimerization. To investigate the pote"
https://openalex.org/W2031799618,"Cyclic AMP-response element modulator α (CREMα) is a transcription factor that is highly related to cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) but represses cAMP-induced gene expression from simple artificial promoters containing a cAMP-response element (CRE). CREMα lacks two glutamine-rich Q regions that, in CREB, are thought to be necessary for transcriptional activation. Nevertheless, protein kinase A stimulation induces CREMα to activate the complex native promoter in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene. To study this phenomenon in the absence of protein kinase A stimulation, we introduced a mutation into CREMα to allow constitutive binding to the coactivator CREB-binding protein. This mutant, CREMαDIEDML, constitutively activated the PEPCK promoter. By engineering the leucine zipper regions of CREMαDIEDML and CREBDIEDML to direct their patterns of dimerization, we found that only CREMαDIEDMLhomodimers fully activated the PEPCK promoter. By using a series of deletion and block mutants of the PEPCK promoter, we found that activation by CREMαDIEDML depended on the CRE and two CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) sites. A dominant negative inhibitor of C/EBP, A-C/EBP, suppressed activation by CREMαDIEDML. Furthermore, a GAL4-C/EBPα fusion protein and CREMαDIEDML cooperatively activated a promoter containing three GAL4 sites and the PEPCK CRE. Thus, we propose that the C/EBP sites in the PEPCK promoter allow CREMα to activate transcription despite its lack of Q regions. Cyclic AMP-response element modulator α (CREMα) is a transcription factor that is highly related to cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) but represses cAMP-induced gene expression from simple artificial promoters containing a cAMP-response element (CRE). CREMα lacks two glutamine-rich Q regions that, in CREB, are thought to be necessary for transcriptional activation. Nevertheless, protein kinase A stimulation induces CREMα to activate the complex native promoter in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene. To study this phenomenon in the absence of protein kinase A stimulation, we introduced a mutation into CREMα to allow constitutive binding to the coactivator CREB-binding protein. This mutant, CREMαDIEDML, constitutively activated the PEPCK promoter. By engineering the leucine zipper regions of CREMαDIEDML and CREBDIEDML to direct their patterns of dimerization, we found that only CREMαDIEDMLhomodimers fully activated the PEPCK promoter. By using a series of deletion and block mutants of the PEPCK promoter, we found that activation by CREMαDIEDML depended on the CRE and two CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) sites. A dominant negative inhibitor of C/EBP, A-C/EBP, suppressed activation by CREMαDIEDML. Furthermore, a GAL4-C/EBPα fusion protein and CREMαDIEDML cooperatively activated a promoter containing three GAL4 sites and the PEPCK CRE. Thus, we propose that the C/EBP sites in the PEPCK promoter allow CREMα to activate transcription despite its lack of Q regions. cyclic AMP-response element modulator cAMP-response element-binding protein cAMP-response element basic leucine zipper kinase-inducible domain protein kinase A CREB-binding protein phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase luciferase The cyclic AMP-response element modulator (CREM)1 gene is alternatively spliced to generate multiple transcription factors that mediate the regulation of transcription by cAMP (reviewed in Ref. 1Sassone-Corsi P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 355-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). These CREM factors form homodimers and heterodimers with the related protein CREB that bind specifically to CREs (TGACGTCA) via their conserved C-terminal basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domains (2Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Three domains encoded by the CREM and CREB genes contribute to transcriptional activation: the kinase-inducible domain (KID) and two glutamine-rich regions designated as Q-1 and Q-2 (3Laoide B.M. Foulkes N.S. Schlotter F. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a serine residue within the KID by PKA allows CREB and CREM to bind to the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) (4Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R.

The Q regions are thought to interact with components of the basal transcriptional machinery (6Ferreri K. Gill G. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In CREB, the deletion of the Q-2 region prevents transcriptional activation (7Brindle P. Linke S. Montminy M. Nature. 1993; 364: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, CREM isoforms that lack Q regions have been shown to act as repressors of cAMP-induced transcription (2Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). These data have lead to the hypothesis that Q regions are required for CREB-mediated transcriptional activation. The CREMα isoform contains a KID but lacks both Q regions (2Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). CREMα represses transcription induced by PKA-activated CREB at a minimal promoter containing the somatostatin CRE (2Foulkes N.S. Borrelli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1991; 64: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). This repression may be mediated by CREB-CREMα heterodimers, which are only weak activators, or by CREMα homodimers that cannot activate transcription at the somatostatin CRE (8Loriaux M.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28839-28843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data form the bulk of the evidence for the hypothesis that CREMα is a repressor of cAMP-induced transcription. However, tests of this hypothesis at native promoters have produced mixed results. For example, CREMα has been shown to be a repressor at the native c-fos and insulin promoters (9Foulkes N.S. Laoide B.M. Schlotter F. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19078-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The PEPCK gene has a complex promoter that contains multiple elements to allow regulation by a variety of hormone-triggered signaling pathways and tissue-specific factors (reviewed in Ref. 12Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In addition, cAMP induces transcription via multiple PEPCK promoter elements (13Liu J. Park E.P. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several transcription factors have been proposed to be involved in the cAMP response: 1) CREB and CREM proteins, which can bind to a nonconsensus CRE (TTACGTCA) ∼85 base pairs upstream of the PEPCK transcription start site; 2) CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), which can bind to the CRE and three upstream sites; and 3) c-Jun, which can bind within the region encompassing the C/EBP sites. All of the above factors are necessary for the full cAMP response at the PEPCK promoter, suggesting that cooperativity among the factors is the crucial aspect of the activation mechanism. In this paper, we examined the mechanism of activation of PEPCK transcription by CREMα. The most direct way to do this was to study the activity of CREMα in isolation from other effectors of PKA at the PEPCK promoter. Thus, we developed a constitutively active PKA-independent mutant of CREMα, CREMαDIEDML, that contains a six-amino acid substitution within the KID (RRPSYR to DIEDML). In the related CREB protein, this substitution has been shown to confer constitutive binding to CBP, resulting in constitutive transcriptional activity (14Cardinaux J.-R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We tested whether the CREMα mutant could activate transcription from the PEPCK promoter as a homodimer or whether heterodimerization with another bZIP factor is required. Also, we used a fluorescence polarization equilibrium binding assay to demonstrate that CREMα binds with high affinity to the PEPCK CRE. Finally, we used the CREMα mutant to ask whether its transcriptional activity depended on other factors that bind to the PEPCK promoter. Our findings led us to propose that the recruitment of CBP to CREMα homodimers can result in the activation of complex promoters containing binding sites for C/EBP. Hep G2 cells were grown as described previously (11Goraya T.Y. Kessler S.P. Stanton P. Hanson R.W. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

C/EBPα protein was a generous gift of Dr. Peter Johnson (Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD). The binding of CBP in HeLa nuclear extracts to glutathioneS-transferase-CREMαDIEDML-(1–171) was assayed as described previously (19Zhang Q. Vo N. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell.

Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) recently developed a constitutively active CREB mutant (CREBDIEDML). This mutant (Fig. 1 A) was made by replacing six residues (RRPSYR, which includes S133) from the KID domain of CREB with six residues (DIEDML) from the sterol response element-binding protein, a transcription factor that binds CBP in the absence of phosphorylation. Whereas wild-type CREB must be phosphorylated at Ser133 to bind to CBP, the substitution of the DIEDML motif conferred constitutive phosphorylation-independent binding. CREBDIEDML activated transcription from CRE-containing reporter genes under basal conditions in a variety of cell types. Thus, the activity of CREBDIEDML could be studied in isolation from other activities stimulated by PKA. We sought to develop a similar mutant of CREMα. Because the relevant regions of CREB and CREMα are identical, we substituted the residues DIEDML for RRPSYR in CREMα to generate the mutant CREMαDIEDML. We tested the activity of this mutant with a reporter gene driven by 490 base pairs of the PEPCK promoter upstream from the transcription start site (−490 PEPCK). It has been demonstrated that the PEPCK promoter can be activated by wild-type CREMα in the presence of cotransfected PKA catalytic subunit in the Hep G2 human liver-derived cell line (11Goraya T.Y. Kessler S.P. Stanton P. Hanson R.W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19078-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that, in the absence of cotransfected PKA, CREMαDIEDML produced an ∼4–5-fold activation of the PEPCK promoter, whereas wild-type CREMα produced only marginal activation. We also performed a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay to confirm that CREMαDIEDML binds CBP (data not shown). Thus, CREMαDIEDML constitutively activates PEPCK transcription by recruiting CBP. We next tested the efficacy and specificity of CREMαDIEDML. To measure efficacy, we compared the ability of CREBDIEDML and CREMαDIEDML to activate the PEPCK promoter. Fig. 2 A shows that CREMαDIEMDL produced a slightly greater activation than CREBDIEDML at all doses. Thus, despite lacking the Q regions, CREMα appears to be a better activator than CREB in the context of the PEPCK promoter. To test specificity, we measured the activity of CREMαDIEDML at the c-fos promoter. Fig.2 B shows that CREMαDIEDML had little effect on c-fos reporter gene transcription, whereas CREBDIEDMLproduced ∼9-fold activation. Thus, it appears that CREMαDIEDML induces transcription only from promoters at which wild-type CREMα can produce activation. These data suggest that CREMαDIEDML can be an effective and specific reagent for testing the mechanism of transcriptional activation by CREMα. In principle, the differences in the activity of CREMαDIEDML and CREBDIEDML at the PEPCK promoter could be due to differences in their ability to bind the PEPCK CRE. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays have demonstrated that CREMα, CREB, and C/EBPα can all bind to the PEPCK CRE (11Goraya T.Y. Kessler S.P. Stanton P. Hanson R.W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19078-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Nizielski S.E. Hakimi P. Cao Z. Moorman A. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 613-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the quantitative accuracy of these assays may be compromised by the separation of bound and free transcription factors during gel electrophoresis. Thus, we used a fluorescence polarization assay (20Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) to determine the affinities of these interactions under equilibrium conditions in solution. Fig. 3 shows that CREMα, CREB, and C/EBPα all bind to the PEPCK CRE withK d = ∼1 nm. Thus, all three transcription factors have the ability to interact with the PEPCK CRE with similarly high affinity. Although it has been presumed that the transfection of CREMαDIEDML into Hep G2 cells results in the formation of stable homodimers, it is possible that CREMαDIEDMLheterodimerizes with endogenous CREB. To test the ability of CREMαDIEDML homodimers and heterodimers to activate the PEPCK promoter, we made two leucine zipper mutants of CREMαDIEDML and CREBDIEDML termed ZIP3 and ZIP4. ZIP3 and ZIP4 contain mutations that are designed to cause them to preferentially associate as heterodimers (8Loriaux M.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28839-28843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of heterodimerization between ZIP3 and ZIP4 mutants is explained in Fig.4 A, which shows these mutations in the context of the crystal structure of the CREB bZIP·CRE complex (21Schumacher M.A. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35242-35247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As indicated, the substitution of the charged residues in the e and g positions of the leucine zipper results in electrostatic repulsion except in the context of the ZIP3/ZIP4 heterodimer. Thus, by cotransfecting the ZIP3 and ZIP4 mutants, we can ensure the formation of the intended dimers. Fig.4 B shows that only the CREMαDIEDMLhomodimer (CREMαDIEDMLZIP3/CREMαDIEDMLZIP4) can activate the PEPCK promoter to the same degree as CREMαDIEDML containing a wild-type leucine zipper. CREMαDIEDML/CREBDIEDML heterodimers (CREMαDIEDMLZIP3/CREBDIEDMLZIP4 or CREMαDIEDMLZIP4/CREBDIEDMLZIP3) produced only marginal activation. Thus, CREMα can activate the PEPCK promoter as a homodimer. Therefore, the requirement of Q regions for CREM-mediated transcriptional activation is highly dependent on promoter context. One possible explanation for the context specificity of the function of CREMα is that it can only activate transcription in cooperation with other factors. The −490 PEPCK promoter contains three groups ofcis-regulatory elements (Fig.5 A) (reviewed in Ref. 12Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). To determine which factors cooperate with CREMα to produce activation, we tested the ability of CREMαDIEDML to activate a series of PEPCK promoter deletion mutants. Fig. 5 B shows that deleting group 3 elements had no effect on reporter gene expression levels produced by CREMαDIEDML. In contrast, deleting both groups 3 and 2 greatly diminished activation by CREMαDIEDML. Moreover, CREMαDIEDML did not activate a PEPCK promoter mutant lacking all regulatory elements upstream of the CRE. Thus, CREMαDIEDML must cooperate with transcription factors that bind to the group 2 region to produce full activation of the PEPCK promoter. Five cis-regulatory elements have been identified in the group 2 region of the PEPCK promoter (Fig. 5 A) (reviewed in Ref. 12Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), three of which (P3I, P3II, and P4) are required for full activation by cAMP (13Liu J. Park E.P. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which of these elements binds factors that cooperate with CREMαDIEDML, we used block mutants that were previously characterized (13Liu J. Park E.P. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The block mutations prevent the binding of rat liver nuclear proteins and greatly diminish the response of the promoter to the catalytic subunit of PKA. Fig. 6 shows the effect of the block mutations on the ability of CREMαDIEDML to activate the PEPCK promoter. Block mutation of the P3I site partially reduced activation by CREMαDIEDML. The activation was further reduced when both the P3I and P4 sites were mutated. In contrast, block mutations in the P2 and P3II sites had little effect on the activation by CREMαDIEDML (data not shown). Thus, CREMα activates transcription in cooperation with factors that bind to the P3I and P4 sites of the PEPCK promoter. The only transcription factors known to bind the P3I and P4 sites in the PEPCK promoter are members of the C/EBP family (22Croniger C. Leahy P. Reshef L. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31629-31632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To test whether C/EBP proteins are required for activation of the PEPCK promoter by CREMαDIEDML, we used a dominant negative inhibitor of C/EBP, A-C/EBP (18Krylov D. Olive M. Vinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5329-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig.7 A shows that A-C/EBP suppressed the stimulatory effect of CREMαDIEDML. Thus, C/EBP proteins appear to be required for the activation of the PEPCK promoter by CREMα. Of the various C/EBP proteins, C/EBPα has been reported to be most critical for activation by cAMP (23Crosson S.M. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5804-5809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To test whether C/EBPα could cooperate with CREMαDIEDML, we used a reporter gene driven by three binding sites for the yeast transcription factor GAL4 and a partial PEPCK promoter containing only the CRE (Fig. 7 B) (termed −109G3 in Ref. 17Roesler W.J. Crosson S.M. Vinson C. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8068-8074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fig.7 C shows that −109G3 was activated to a greater degree by the combination of both Gal4-C/EBPα and CREMαDIEDMLthan by each factor alone. These data suggest that the factor that cooperates with CREMα to allow activation of the PEPCK promoter is C/EBPα. In this study, we examined the mechanism by which CREMα activates PEPCK transcription. To do this, we developed a constitutively active mutant of CREMα, CREMαDIEDML. CREMαDIEDML probably functions by constitutive binding to CBP as does the related mutant, CREBDIEDML (14Cardinaux J.-R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol.

The phosphorylation-independent activity of these mutants allowed us to study their activity in isolation from other effectors of PKA at the PEPCK promoter (e.g. AP1) (24Gurney A.L. Park E.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14276-14283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In principle, the activation of PEPCK transcription by CREMαDIEDML (Fig. 1) could have been produced by CREMαDIEDML homodimers or by heterodimers of CREMαDIEDML with endogenous unphosphorylated CREB. In the latter case, the unphosphorylated CREB molecule could provide the Q regions capable of contacting the basal transcriptional machinery, which has been proposed to be a requirement for CREB-mediated transcriptional activation. We tested these two possibilities by engineering the leucine zipper regions of CREMαDIEDML and CREBDIEDML to direct their pattern of dimerization. Also, we tested whether activation of PEPCK transcription by CREMαDIEDML depended on cooperative interactions with other factors that bind the PEPCK promoter. Our finding that CREMα homodimer activates the PEPCK promoter (Fig.4 C) shows that Q regions are not always necessary for transcriptional activation. Indeed, Q regions appear to be detrimental to the activation at the PEPCK promoter. CREBDIEDML is slightly less active than CREMαDIEDML (Fig.2 A), and CREMαDIEDML/CREBDIEDMLheterodimers produce only marginal activation (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, the importance of these regions at some promoters is indicated by the observation that deletion of the Q-2 region eliminates activation of a somatostatin CRE reporter gene by CREB (7Brindle P. Linke S. Montminy M. Nature. 1993; 364: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that the c-fos promoter could not be activated by CREMαDIEDML. Thus, the function of the Q regions appears to be highly dependent on promoter context. CREMαDIEDML only marginally activated transcription from a promoter containing just the PEPCK CRE (Fig. 5) or a PEPCK promoter with mutations in two C/EBP sites (Fig. 6). Thus, the recruitment of CBP by CREMα is not sufficient for activation of the PEPCK promoter. Rather, it appears that CREMα must cooperate with C/EBPα to achieve full activation (Fig. 7). Perhaps C/EBPα also interacts with CBP, either directly or through an intermediate protein. This interaction might serve to stabilize the binding of CBP with CREMα at the PEPCK promoter as has been proposed for C/EBPβ and Myb at the Mim-1 promoter (26Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further work will be required to elucidate the mechanism of cooperation between CREMα and C/EBPα at the PEPCK promoter. Our data with CREMαDIEDML led us to propose the model shown in Fig. 8 for the mechanism of activation of the PEPCK promoter. In this model, a CREMα homodimer binds to the PEPCK CRE. Direct contacts between this homodimer and the basal transcriptional machinery are not required. Phosphorylation of CREMα leads to the recruitment of CBP. In addition, the binding of two C/EBPα dimers at the P3I and P4 sites appears to be required for transcriptional activation. C/EBPα may help to further stabilize the interaction of CBP with CREMα. The model implies that the characterization of CREMα as a transcriptional repressor may pertain only to certain promoters. At some promoters, cooperative interactions with factors such as C/EBPα may allow CREMα to function as a transcriptional activator. One prediction that could be made based on our data with the PEPCK promoter is that CREMα may be able to activate any promoter containing CRE and C/EBPα binding sites. However, the c-fos promoter contains a C/EBP binding site (27Metz R. Ziff E. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2165-2178PubMed Google Scholar), and it is not activated by CREMαDIEDML (Fig. 2 B). The spacing of the C/EBP binding sites and the CREs differ in the c-fos and PEPCK promoters, and this difference may be a critical determinant of whether CREMα can serve as an activator. Certainly cooperative activation by CREMα and C/EBPα is very much dependent on promoter context. It is possible, however, that CREMα and C/EBPα may cooperatively activate other genes. We thank Drs. Richard Hanson and William Roesler for providing plasmids. We also thank Drs. Peter Johnson and James Lundblad for the generous gifts of C/EBPα and CREMα proteins."

The mechanism of DNA synthesis and its regulation is highly complex requiring the interplay of many proteins that cooperate to duplicate the genetic information for the next generation rapidly and accurately (1Waga S.

Factors required for DNA replication in eukaryotes have been identified using replication of simian virus 40 (SV40) as a model system because all of the proteins required for SV40, except the viral large T antigen, are host-provided (5Li J.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our current understanding of DNA replication in eukaryotes suggests that polymerase α (pol1 α)−primase synthesizes the first RNA/DNA primer on the leading strand which is then followed by the binding of RF-C and loading of PCNA and a polymerase switch from pol α to pol δ. Thus pol δ holoenzyme performs processive leading strand synthesis, whereas pol α participates in RNA priming and lagging strand synthesis. However, complete synthesis of Okazaki fragments also requires participation of pol δ holoenzyme (9Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A vital element of the DNA replication machinery is the ability of DNA pol δ to execute processive DNA synthesis allowing the polymerase to move quickly along the template thousands of nucleotides without dissociation. This is accomplished in Escherichia coli by the β subunit of DNA pol III and in eukaryotes by PCNA, which is a processivity factor for pol δ (16Prelich G. Tan C.K. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. So A.G. Downey K.M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the β subunit and PCNA showed a toroidal structure that can encircle the DNA (17Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J.

Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). PCNA is a homotrimer in which each subunit consists of two structurally related domains giving the molecule a 6-fold symmetry. The center of the ring is positively charged, and it is large enough to allow free passage of double-stranded DNA. PCNA is loaded onto DNA by the action of RF-C (11Lee S.H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tsurimoto T. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell.

The RF-C·PCNA complex then tethers pol δ onto the template to assemble a highly processive pol δ·PCNA·RF-C complex also known as the pol δ holoenzyme. However, in the absence of RF-C, PCNA can still load onto linear DNA at a double-stranded end, albeit at much lower efficiency (22Burgers P.M. Yoder B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19226-19923Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The orientation of the PCNA ring provides two surfaces, one facing the primer-template junction required for pol δ and RF-C binding and the other surface facing the double-stranded DNA for binding of other proteins (23Fukuda K.

Besides being required for coordinated leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis at a replication fork (25Prelich G. Stillman B.

However, deletions in any part of the molecule including the N and C termini distort the tertiary structure, rendering the protein of limited use in functional assays. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of PCNA, pol30, shares 35% sequence identity with the human PCNA (hPCNA) and is able to enhance the processivity of the mammalian pol δ (52Bauer G.A. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7506-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but it is unable to complement hPCNA in SV40 DNA replication in vitro(53Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This suggests that S. cerevisiae PCNA (cPCNA) has very low affinity for mammalian pol δ and RF-C, even though both yeast and mammalian PCNAs exist as trimers (54Krishna T.S. Fenyo D. Kong X.P. Gary S. Chait B.T. Burgers P. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 55Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). We therefore argued that by swapping different regions between h- and cPCNA, it should be possible to generate hybrids that were equivalent to large deletions in hPCNA while retaining a trimeric structure. Functional analyses of these hybrids would help to define region(s) of hPCNA involved in DNA replication. We introduced mutations in the highly conserved region of PCNA and also generated a set of novel human-S. cerevisiae PCNA hybrids. These PCNAs were examined for their ability to stimulate pol δ and RF-C or to function in DNA replication assays. The stimulation of RF-C and pol δ involves associations on at least three sites located at the N and C termini, and at the interdomain connector (IDC) loop of PCNA. We have observed induction of RF-C-catalyzed ATPase activity by a PCNA hybrid that was predominantly dimeric, suggesting that PCNA trimers may not be necessary for stimulation of RF-C ATPase. Our data also suggest that assembly of the pol δ holoenzyme may require participation of other proteins at a replication fork.

This resulted in 10 different constructs containing part of the hPCNA fused with a part of cPCNA (see Table II), which were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The hybrids were named by two letters followed by a number in which the first letter was derived from the species contributing the N terminus followed by the species contributing the C terminus. For example, hybrids with the human sequence at the N terminus were named HC whereas those with S. cerevisiae sequence at their N terminus were named as CH. The contribution of the two PCNAs in each hybrid is shown in Table II.Table IIContribution of the h- and cPCNA in different hybrids used in this study along with the origin of IDC loopPCNA hybridsContribution from hPCNAContribution from cPCNAOrigin of IDC loop2-aIDC loop extends from residues 118 to 135.amino acidsamino acidsHC11–2021–258S. cerevisiaeHC51–211212–258HumanCH273–2611–72HumanCH3121–2611–12012% S. cerevisiae88% HumanCH4175–2611–174S. cerevisiaeCH5212–2611–211S. cerevisiae2-a IDC loop extends from residues 118 to 135. Open table in a new tab Plasmids constructs encoding wt, mutant, and hybrid PCNA were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for expression of protein. An overnight culture (0.75 ml) was used to inoculate 200 ml of LB + ampicillin and grown at 37 °C until A600 reached to 0.6. The protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for 3–6 h at 37 °C. The procedure for extraction and purification of PCNA from recombinant bacteria was carried out at 4 °C. Bacteria from 200-ml cultures were harvested at 3,000 rpm for 15 min, resuspended into 4 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 μm pepstatin A, 10 mm NaHSO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmDTT), and sonicated to disrupt cells and reduce viscosity. The mixture was adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl, cleared by centrifugation, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (1.2 × 11 cm) equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl and buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 μm pepstatin A, 10 mm NaHSO3, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT). After washing the column, bound PCNA was eluted with a 0.2–0.7 m linear NaCl gradient in buffer A. The PCNA-containing fractions, identified by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mmKPO4, pH 7.0, and buffer B (10 mmKPO4, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 μm pepstatin A, 10 mm NaHSO3, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT) and loaded onto an S-Sepharose column (1.2 x 11 cm). The PCNA-containing flow-through fractions were pooled and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (2.5 × 11 cm) equilibrated with 25 mmKPO4 and buffer B and eluted with a 0.025–0.5m linear phosphate gradient in buffer B. The PCNA-containing fractions from the hydroxyapatite column were pooled, dialyzed against 1.2 m NaCl and buffer C (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 μm pepstatin A, 10 mm NaHSO3, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm DTT), and 4 ml of the sample was loaded onto a phenyl-agarose column (1.2 × 11 cm). The protein was eluted with a decreasing linear salt gradient from 1.2 to 0 m NaCl in buffer C, and the PCNA-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20% sucrose, 25 mm NaCl, and buffer A and stored in aliquots at −70 °C until used. SDS-PAGE of PCNA proteins was carried out on 12% polyacrylamide gels using the conditions described elsewhere (61Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using nitrocellulose membranes as described earlier (62Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis was carried out on 8–25% gradient gels using the Phast System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Chemical cross-linking was carried out using ethylene glycol-bis-succinimidyl succinate as described previously (63Zhang P. Zhang S.J. Zhang Z. Woessner Jr., J.F. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10703-10712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purified wt, mutant, and hybrid PCNA preparations (100 μg) were applied onto a Superose 12 HR10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, and 250 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated by eluting a sample of blue dextran and five native molecular mass markers, lactate dehydrogenase (145 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa). The elution volume for each marker was the time taken to elute the peak fraction of that sample. The peak fractions (300–500 μl) for each PCNA were collected, concentrated using Centricon™ microconcentrators (Amicon), and the presence of PCNA was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The DNA pol δ stimulation assay used in this study was a slightly modified version of that described previously (12Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1961-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) contained 30 mm HEPES/NaOH pH 6.6 buffer, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, (dA)540, oligo(dT)16, in a ratio of 19:1 in nucleotides, 40 μm dTTP, 0.17 pmol of [α-32P]TTP, 0.15 unit of calf thymus pol δ, and different concentrations of PCNA. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and 2 μl was spotted on DE81 paper (Whatman), washed in 0.5 m Na2HPO4, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. The processivity assay was essentially as described above except that the reactions contained limiting amounts of PCNA (0.5–5 ng) and 0.0075 unit of pol δ in the presence of 1.7 pmol of [α-32P]TTP. The incorporated radioactivity was determined as described above, and the rest of the reaction mixture was analyzed on a 2% alkaline agarose gel and visualized by autoradiography. RF-C ATPase activity was measured according to a protocol described previously (57Ellison V. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5979-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 30 mm HEPES pH 7.5 buffer, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm ATP, 3 pmol of [α-32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol), 0.25 pmol of RF-C, 0.4 μmol of hairpin DNA with 5′-single-strand extension, and different concentrations of PCNA. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and stopped by 10 mm EDTA. One-tenth (2 μl) of the reaction mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate that had been pretreated with 1 m formic acid. The plates were then developed in a mixture of 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl for 60 min. After autoradiography the amount of ADP produced was determined by scanning the plates on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). M13 DNA synthesis reactions were carried out by incubating singly primed M13mp18 DNA with pol δ, RF-C, PCNA, and RPA as described previously (56Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3883-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The SV40 DNA replication assays in vitro were performed as described previously (16Prelich G. Tan C.K. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. So A.G. Downey K.M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) using S100, fraction IA, fraction II, large T antigen, and SV40 origin of replication containing plasmid, pSV011. The optimal amounts of extracts and proteins required in the assay were determined empirically by titration. Reaction mixtures were assembled using PCNA, pSV011, fractions IA and II, large T antigen, nucleotide mixture, and creatine phosphate/creatine phosphokinase on ice. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h; the controls were left on ice. After terminating the reaction with 20 mm EDTA, the32P incorporation was determined using DE81 paper. The remaining portion of the reaction mixture from either M13 or SV40 assay was deproteinated with proteinase K and extracted with phenol/chloroform. After precipitating with ethanol, the replication products were analyzed on an agarose gel, fixed in a mixture of 10% methanol + 10% acetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed. The techniques used for genetic manipulation of bacteria were performed using standard protocols (64Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Sigma) using BSA as standard. Nuclease contamination in PCNA preparations was tested by incubating each PCNA protein (20 ng–2 μg) with 1 μg of pGEX-2T for 1 h at 37 °C followed by separation on an agarose gel. All gel pictures and blots were scanned and assembled using the Adobe PhotoShop version 5. We have produced 4 hPCNA (HU) and 5 cP"
