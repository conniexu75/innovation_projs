https://openalex.org/W2005706069,"Poly(adenosine 5'-diphosphoribose) synthetase (PARS) is a nuclear enzyme which, when activated by DNA strand breaks, adds up to 100 adenosine 5'-diphosphoribose (ADP-ribose) units to nuclear proteins such as histones and PARS itself. This activation can lead to cell death through depletion of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (the source of ADP-ribose) and adenosine triphosphate. Nitric oxide (NO) stimulated ADP-ribosylation of PARS in rat brain. Benzamide and other derivatives, which inhibit PARS, blocked N-methyl-D-aspartate- and NO-mediated neurotoxicity with relative potencies paralleling their ability to inhibit PARS. Thus, NO appeared to elicit neurotoxicity by activating PARS."
https://openalex.org/W1986841583,"The role of the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in signal transduction is undefined. Nerve growth factor can activate the sphingomyelin cycle, generating the putative-lipid second messenger ceramide. In T9 glioma cells, addition of a cell-permeable ceramide analog mimicked the effects of nerve growth factor on cell growth inhibition and process formation. This signaling pathway appears to be mediated by p75NTR in T9 cells and NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing p75NTR. Expression of an epidermal growth factor receptor-p75NTR chimera in T9 cells imparted to epidermal growth factor the ability to activate the sphingomyelin cycle. These data demonstrate that p75NTR is capable of signaling independently of the trk neurotrophin receptor (p140trk) and that ceramide may be a mediator in neurotrophin biology."
https://openalex.org/W1577509897,"We describe experiments which show that: 1) two previously identified members of the GATA family of transcription factors (both of which were originally called GATA-4) correspond to chicken cDNAs for two distinct factors (which we now refer to as cGATA-4 and cGATA-5); 2) another new member of this family corresponds to a third factor designated cGATA-6; 3) each of these mRNAs displays a differential expression pattern. The cGATA-5 gene is initially transcribed in the cardiac crescent prior to formation of the primordial heart tube. Following formation of the primitive heart, cGATA-5 transcripts are evident in both endocardium and myocardium as well as in other lateral plate derivatives. The cGATA-5 gene is also transcribed in the primitive embryonic gut and in late stage embryos is sequentially up-regulated in distinct segments of gastrointestinal epithelia as they undergo terminal differentiation. These studies thus provide novel insights into tissue-specific regulation by GATA-5, as well as into possibly overlapping regulatory functions for these three family members."
https://openalex.org/W1983777466,"The neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) act upon populations of neurons that express specific receptors. The present study demonstrates that BDNF rescues motor neurons from degeneration and may also play a role in the normal physiology of these cells. BDNF is expressed in the local environment and in muscle targets of motor neurons; muscle expression is up-regulated by denervation. The a motor neurons express the gene encoding p145trkB, a receptor involved in BDNF signal transduction, whereas a subset of motor neurons express p75NGFR. BDNF is transported selectively to Î± motor neurons from skeletal muscles. Finally, BDNF prevents motor neuron death in the axotomized facial nucleus of the neonatal rat. The effects of BDNF on motor neurons raise the possibility that some neurotrophins may be useful in treating patients with motor neuropathies and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2072306011,"The height fluctuations on top of the protein lysozyme adsorbed on mica were measured locally with an atomic force microscope operated in tapping mode in liquid. Height fluctuations of an apparent size of 1 nanometer that lasted for about 50 milliseconds were observed over lysozyme molecules when a substrate (oligoglycoside) was present. In the presence of the inhibitor chitobiose, these height fluctuations decreased to the level without the oligoglycoside. The most straightforward interpretation of these results is that the height fluctuations correspond to the conformational changes of lysozyme during hydrolysis. It is also possible, however, that the height fluctuations are, at least in part, the result of a different height or elasticity of the transient complex of lysozyme plus the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1965796676,"Endogenous DNA adducts may contribute to the etiology of human genetic disease and cancer. One potential source of endogenous DNA adducts is lipid peroxidation, which generates mutagenic carbonyl compounds such as malondialdehyde. A sensitive mass spectrometric method permitted detection and quantitation of the major malondialdehyde-DNA adduct, a pyrimidopurinone derived from deoxyguanosine. DNA from disease-free human liver was found to contain 5400 adducts per cell, a frequency comparable to that of adducts formed by exogenous carcinogens."
https://openalex.org/W1512414376,"To understand the genes involved in breast cancer invasion and metastasis, we analyzed a novel candidate metastasis-associated gene, mta1, which was isolated by differential cDNA library screening using the 13762NF rat mammary adenocarcinoma metastatic system. Northern blot analyses showed that the mRNA expression level of the mta1 gene was 4-fold higher in the highly metastatic cell line MTLn3 than in the nonmetastatic cell line MTC.4. The mta1 gene was expressed in various normal rat organs, especially in the testis, suggesting its essential normal function. The mRNA expression levels of the human homologue of this gene also correlated with the metastatic potential in two human breast cancer metastatic systems. The full-length mta1 cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame encoding a protein of 703 amino acid residues, and sequence analysis by data base homology search indicated that mta1 is a novel gene. The Mta1 protein contained several possible phosphorylation sites, and a proline-rich amino acid stretch at the carboxyl-terminal end completely matched the consensus sequence for the src homology 3 domain-binding motif. Using antibodies raised against glutathione S-transferase-Mta1 fusion protein or a synthetic oligopeptide, Western blots showed that the molecular mass of the Mta1 protein was approximately 80 kDa, and the levels of the Mta1 protein also correlated with the metastatic potential, results similar to those obtained from the Northern analyses. Thus, the novel gene mta1 may encode a molecule that is functional in normal cells as well as in breast cancer invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1510108058,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins is a critical event in T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated activation. This pathway has also been implicated in cellular transformation in multiple systems. The viral oncogene v-cbl is the transforming gene of a murine retrovirus that induces pre-B cell lymphomas and myelogenous leukemias. The product of its cellular homolog, p120cbl, is a 120-kDa cytoplasmic protein that is non-transforming when overexpressed. Here we show that the 120-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylated in Jurkat T cells upon TCR engagement is p120cbl. Following stimulation through the TCR, this tyrosine phosphorylation is rapid and reversible. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p120cbl binds to glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins generated from SH2 domains of the Fyn, Lck, and Blk protein tyrosine kinases, GTPase-activating protein and phospholipase C gamma. The p120cbl from unactivated and activated cells also binds to full-length glutathione S-transferase-Grb2 and the Grb2 N-terminal SH3 domain, but not to the Grb2 C-terminal SH3 domain. Additionally, p120cbl binds to SH3 domains of Fyn and Lck, but not Blk. These data expand our knowledge of protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways in T cells by identifying a prominent tyrosine kinase substrate. This protein, the product of the cellular homolog of a transforming oncogene, can interact with several known signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1484834653,"The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1), detected in virtually all cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), is formed by a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22 that fuses Bcr-encoded sequences upstream of exon 2 of c-Abl. This oncogene produces a fusion protein, p210bcr-abl, in which the Abl tyrosine kinase activity is elevated. Using anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, we have compared the pattern of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins from freshly prepared neutrophils of patients in the stable phase of CML to normal controls. The only consistent difference was the presence of a 39-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in 18 out of 18 neutrophil samples from CML patients that was not seen in normal controls. This same protein, as assessed by two-dimensional anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, was also present in cell lines expressing p210bcr-abl, including K562 cells. Using K562 cells as a source of protein, the 39-kDa protein was purified and identified by microsequencing as Crkl, an SH2/SH3 adaptor protein related to the crk oncogene of the avian sarcoma virus, CT10. A direct interaction between Crkl and Abl has also been shown using a yeast two-hybrid screen."
https://openalex.org/W1636945110,"Arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) is a naturally occurring brain constituent that binds to a specific brain cannabinoid receptor (CBR1). An amidase activity (anandamide amidase) in membrane fractions of brain and in cultured neuroblastoma cells rapidly degrades anandamide to arachidonic acid (Deutsch, D. G., and Chin, S. (1993) Biochem. Pharmacol. 46, 791-796). In the current study, analogs of anandamide representing three classes of putative transition-state inhibitor (trifluoromethyl ketones, alpha-keto esters, and alpha-keto amides) were synthesized and tested as inhibitors of anandamide hydrolysis in vitro and as ligands for CBR1. The trifluoromethyl ketones and alpha-keto esters showed nearly 100% inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis in vitro at 7.5 microM inhibitor and 27.7 microM anandamide. Arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone was the only synthetic compound in the series of fatty acid derivatives able to displace [3H]CP-55940 binding to CBR1 with a Ki of 0.65 microM. It was also the most effective inhibitor in intact neuroblastoma cells, leading to a 12-fold increase of cellular anandamide levels at 12 microM. From the action of these inhibitors on this hydrolytic enzyme, it seems likely that anandamide is cleaved by a mechanism that involves an active-site serine hydroxyl group. These inhibitors may serve as useful tools to elucidate the role anandamide plays in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1507086201,"Abstract Pan-kinesin peptide antibodies (Cole, D. G., Cande, W. Z., Baskin, R. J., Skoufias, D. A., Hogan, C. J., and Scholey, J. M. (1992) J. Cell Sci. 101, 291-301; Sawin, K. E., Mitchinson, T. J., and Wordeman, L. G. (1992) J. Cell Sci. 101, 303-313) were used to identify and isolate kinesin-related proteins (KRPs) from Drosophila melanogaster embryonic cytosol. These KRPs cosedimented with microtubules (MTs) polymerized from cytosol treated with AMP-PNP (adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate), and one of them, KRP130, was further purified from ATP eluates of the embryonic MTs. Purified KRP130 behaves as a homotetrameric complex composed of four 130-kDa polypeptide subunits which displays a slow plus-end directed motor activity capable of moving single MTs at 0.04 +/- 0.01 microns/s. The 130-kDa subunit of KRP130 was tested for reactivity with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that are specific for various members of the kinesin superfamily. Results indicate that the KRP130 subunit is related to Xenopus Eg5 (Sawin, K. E., Le Guellec, K. L., Philippe, M., Mitchinson, T. J. (1992) Nature 359, 540-543), a member of the BimC subfamily of kinesins. Therefore, KRP130 appears to be the first Drosophila KRP, and the first member of the BimC subfamily in any organism, to be purified from native tissue as a multimeric motor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1531982572,"PHAS-I is a heat- and acid-stable protein that is phosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues in response to insulin and growth factors. To investigate the phosphorylation of PHAS-I, the protein was expressed in bacteria and purified for use as substrate in protein kinase reactions in vitro. Recombinant PHAS-I was rapidly and stoichiometrically phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. At saturating MgATP, the Km and Vmax observed with PHAS-I were almost identical to those obtained with myelin basic protein, one of the best MAP kinase substrates. PHAS-I was also phosphorylated at a significant rate by casein kinase II and protein kinase C. To investigate sites of phosphorylation, PHAS-I was digested with collagenase and phosphopeptides were resolved by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Almost all of the phosphate introduced by MAP kinase was recovered in the peptide, Leu-Met-Glu-Cys-Arg-Asn-Ser-Pro-Val-Ala-Lys-Thr. 32P was released in the seventh cycle of Edman degradation, identifying the Ser (Ser64) as the phosphorylated residue. Ser64 was also phosphorylated in response to insulin in rat adipocytes. We conclude that PHAS-I is a substrate for MAP kinase both in vivo and in vitro. As PHAS-I is one of the most prominent insulin-stimulated phosphoproteins in adipocytes, it may qualify as the major MAP kinase substrate in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1491993630,"The hnRNP C proteins (C1/C2) are tenacious nuclear pre-mRNA-binding proteins that belong to the large RNP motif family of RNA-binding proteins. This motif identifies an RNA-binding domain (RBD) that consists of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet packed against two alpha-helices. Despite considerable information on the structure of the hnRNP C RBD, little is known about its RNA-binding properties. To address this we used in vitro selection/amplification from pools of random sequence RNA to determine the RNA-binding specificity of hnRNP C1. After 8 rounds of selection/amplification nearly all RNAs contained contiguous stretches of at least 5 U residues, and filter-binding assays demonstrated that this sequence constitutes a high-affinity (Kd = 170 nM) binding site for hnRNP C1. The highest affinity we measured for hnRNP C1 was for r(U)14 (Kd = 14 nM). An RBD-containing peptide fragment of hnRNP C1 (amino acids 2-94) bound oligoribonucleotides containing an hnRNP C1 high-affinity binding site with nearly equal affinity to that of hnRNP C1. Unlike hnRNP C1, however, this peptide also bound oligoribonucleotides that do not contain high-affinity hnRNP C1-binding sites. We identified a region of 10 amino acids, immediately COOH-terminal to the RNP motif (amino acids 95-104), that prevents the minimal RBD from binding nonspecific RNA ligands. We propose that the highly conserved beta alpha beta beta alpha beta core structure of the RNP motif RBD confers a general RNA binding activity to RNP motif RBDs and that the determinants of RNA-binding specificity reside in the most variable regions, the loops connecting the beta-strands and/or the contiguous NH2 and COOH termini of the RBD."
https://openalex.org/W1646051950,"We have transiently expressed the rat Kv2.1 K+ channel polypeptide (pKv2.1) at high levels by transfection of mammalian COS-1 cells. Kv2.1-transfected cells express a molecular mass of 108 kDa pKv2.1, larger than the size of the core polypeptide (95 kDa) predicted from the deduced primary sequence and of pKv2.1 synthesized in cell free or Xenopus oocyte translation systems. The increased size of pKv2.1 in COS-1 cells is due to a posttranslational modification that occurs early (t1/2 = 5 min) in the biosynthetic transport through the endomembrane system, presumably while the protein resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. The increased size is entirely due to phosphorylation, based on in vivo 32P-labeling and sensitivity to alkaline phosphatase digestion. Immunofluorescent localization of pKv2.1 shows intense surface labeling; no intracellular pools of retained protein are apparent. Immunogold electron microscopy confirms that the expressed polypeptide is found on the cell surface in small clusters or patches of 10-15 gold particles. Cells expressing pKv2.1 exhibit large, voltage-dependent outward currents. The pharmacological properties of the expressed Kv2.1 currents are virtually indistinguishable from those described previously in Xenopus oocytes microinjected with Kv2.1 cRNA, but differences in voltage-dependent properties were observed. High level of expression of functional pKv2.1 in these cells points to the utility of this system for the rapid biochemical, cell biological and electrophysiological analysis of altered forms of pKv2.1, and other members of the K+ channel gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1500103283,"Previous studies have shown that the polysialic acid (PSA) moiety associated with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has strong antiadhesive properties that can influence a variety of cell-cell interactions. Based on the size and structure of this long linear homopolymer, we have proposed that the activity of PSA results from its physical properties. In the present study, the premise that the charge and hydration properties of PSA underlie its effects on membrane vesicle aggregation is investigated through the manipulation of ionic strength. The results establish that the antiadhesive properties of PSA are accentuated at low ionic strength, where charge and hydration cause expansion of the polymer size, and are absent at high ionic strengths, where the polymer size collapses. These large effects of PSA on aggregation were shown not to result from changes in the osmolarity of the solvent or from the relatively small effect of ionic strength on the intrinsic functional properties of the adhesion receptors. In addition to this influence on overall membrane-membrane interaction, PSA was found to have a highly localized and ionic strength-sensitive effect on the binding of monoclonal antibodies to NCAM. Together these results suggest that the charge and hydration properties of PSA can impede both molecular interactions between apposing membranes and more direct contact of NCAM with other proteins at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2266514541,"Phospholamban interacts with SERCA2 (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase isoform 2) but not SERCA3. The use of chimeric SERCA2/SERCA3 molecules has revealed that amino acids 336-412 in the phosphorylation domain of SERCA2 are essential for functional association with phospholamban (Toyofuku, T., Kurzydlowski, K., Tada, M., and MacLennan, D. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2809-2815). When mutations were made in SERCA2 between amino acids 336 and 412 and the mutants were coexpressed with phospholamban, only mutation of amino acids Lys397 to Val402 affected phospholamban association with the Ca(2+)-ATPase. A chimeric Ca(2+)-ATPase, CH2, was created in which the phosphorylation domain of SERCA2 was replaced with that of SERCA3, disrupting functional interaction with phospholamban. The SERCA3 sequence QGEQLV402 was then mutated to the corresponding SERCA2 sequence, KDD-KPV402, and to the sequence KGEKPV402, resulting in restoration of functional interaction with phospholamban. Mutation to KGNKPV402 or to QGEQPV402 did not restore functional interaction with phospholamban. These results demonstrate that amino acids Lys397-Val402 comprise the interaction site with phospholamban in SERCA2, and probably also in SERCA1, and that the appropriate balance of charged and hydrophobic residues is an important feature of the interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1526165969,"The pig and human dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) cDNAs were cloned and sequenced. The pig enzyme, expressed in Escherichia coli, catalyzed the reduction of uracil, thymine, and 5-fluorouracil with kinetics approximating those published for the enzyme purified from mammalian liver. DPD could be expressed in significant quantities only when uracil was added to the bacterial growth medium. The pig and human enzymes contained 1025 amino acids and calculated M(r) = 111,416 and 111,398, respectively. Conserved domains corresponding to a possible NADPH binding site and FAD binding site were found in the NH2-terminal half of the proteins and two motifs of putative [4Fe-4S] binding sites were found near to the carboxyl terminus of the enzyme. The latter corresponds to the labile COOH-terminal fragment previously shown to contain the iron sulfur centers. A sequence encompassing a peptide corresponding to the uracil binding site was found between the NADPH/FAD-containing NH2-terminal portion of the protein and the iron-sulfur binding sites near to the COOH terminus. Thus, the DPD appears to be derived from at least three distinct domains. The DPYD gene was localized to the centromeric region of human chromosome 1 between 1p22 and q21."
https://openalex.org/W1568862210,"The requirement for protein kinase C (PKC)-beta in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced macrophage differentiation of human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells was studied by using the variant HL-525, which is deficient in PKC-beta and is resistant to PMA-induced differentiation. Transfecting these resistant HL-525 cells with expression vectors containing either PKC-beta I or PKC-beta II cDNA resulted in clones that displayed PKC-beta transcript levels similar to or higher than those of the parental HL-60 cells or cells from a PMA-susceptible HL-60 clone, HL-205. These productive transfectants also exhibited PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading, inhibition of cell replication, reactivity to the OKM1 monoclonal antibody, and the ability to phagocytize opsonized beads, which are all characteristic macrophage markers. No PMA-induced differentiation markers were observed in any of the PKC-beta I or PKC-beta II transfectants that did not exhibit an increased PKC-beta RNA level or in cells transfected with control plasmids. These results indicate that restoration of the PKC-beta isozyme deficiency by productive gene transfection causes HL-525 cells to revert to a phenotype like that of the parental HL-60 cells, which is characterized by susceptibility to PMA-induced macrophage differentiation. Therefore, we can conclude that PKC-beta is one of the essential elements in the PMA-induced signal transduction pathway which leads to macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells and perhaps in other related cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1583215218,"A novel rat 4.4-kilobase (kb) cDNA encoding a low molecular weight Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and its murine homologue were cloned. The rat and mouse cDNA predict a mature protein of 130 amino acids (M(r) = 14, 763) preceded by a 28-amino acid prepro-peptide. The deduced amino acid sequences encode a protein containing 16 cysteines which distinguishes them from both mammalian group I and II PLA2s and the recently described group of mammalian PLA2s containing 12 cysteines. A rat RNA blot hybridized with the rat cDNA exhibited an abundant 2.3-kb and a less abundant 5-kb transcript in testis. When the rat cDNA was expressed using an Epstein-Barr virus-based vector in human 293s cells, PLA2 activity accumulated in the culture medium. Conditioned medium optimally hydrolyzed the phospholipids of [1-14C]oleate-labeled Escherichia coli at neutral to alkaline pH with 1-7 mM Ca2+. In assays with individual substrates, L-alpha-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl phosphatidylinositol was hydrolyzed more efficiently than L-alpha-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine, L-alpha-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine, or L-alpha-1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl phosphatidylethanolamine."
https://openalex.org/W1611994978,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase is the key enzyme in PAF inactivation. We recently purified one isoform of the enzyme from a bovine brain soluble fraction and revealed it as a heterotrimeric enzyme consisting of 29-, 30-, and 45-kDa subunits. Among them, the 29-kDa subunit possesses an active serine residue since diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), an inhibitor of the enzyme, labeled only this subunit (Hattori, M., Arai, H., and Inoue, K. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18748-18753). In the current study, we cloned the cDNA for the 29-kDa catalytic subunit. The predicted sequence of 232 amino acids is unique and is not homologous with those of any other proteins reported so far. When transfected into either Escherichia coli or COS7 cells, the cDNA produced PAF acetylhydrolase activity in both types of cells, indicating that this subunit alone is enough for catalysis. The recombinant 29-kDa protein was also inhibited and labeled by DFP. Furthermore, we isolated and sequenced the [3H]DFP-labeled peptide fragment, revealing that Ser47 is the active serine residue. The sequence surrounding it is different from the consensus sequence of the serine esterase family. Interestingly, the sequence of about 30 amino acids located 6 residues downstream from the active serine site exhibits significant homology to the first transmembrane region of the PAF receptor. These data demonstrate that the catalytic subunit of brain PAF acetylhydrolase is a novel type of serine esterase."
https://openalex.org/W92169787,"We report the entire primary structure of the human alpha 3(IV) collagen chain determined from cDNA clones and polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNAs. The deduced amino acid sequence demonstrates that the complete translation product consists of 1670 amino acid residues and the mature alpha 3(IV) chain contains 1642 residues with a corresponding calculated molecular mass of 161,753. The full-length translated polypeptide has a signal peptide of 28 amino acids, a 1410-residue collagenous domain starting with a 14-residue noncollagenous sequence, and a 232-residue NC1 domain. There are 23 noncollagenous interruptions in the Gly-X-Y repeat sequence of the collagenous domain. The major transcription start site of the alpha 3(IV) chain gene was also determined from genomic DNA by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection assays. Northern analysis revealed coexpression of the alpha 3(IV) and alpha 4(IV) chains in tissues where expression was observed such as in kidney, muscle, and lung."
https://openalex.org/W1575919497,"Biotin-dependent enzymes play an essential role in the metabolism of all organisms. Their biotinylation is catalyzed by holoenzyme synthetases, which attach a biotin molecule to a specific lysine residue on the apoenzymes. The sequence flanking the biotin binding site is highly conserved among biotin-dependent enzymes. This sequence conservation might be related to the extensive cross-species activity showed by holoenzyme synthetases. In this study, we have expressed carboxyl-terminal fragments of the alpha subunit of human propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC-alpha) in Escherichia coli and used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the sequence requirements for biotinylation by the bacterial holoenzyme synthetase. We show that the carboxyl-terminal 67 amino acids of PCC-alpha act as an independent domain in the biotinylation reaction. Mutations that affect several conserved Gly residues and a Pro-Met-Pro sequence near the biotin binding site are critical for biotinylation. Substitution of the amino acids that flank the biotin acceptor Lys residue or elimination of the last 3 amino acids of the PCC-alpha peptides had little or no effect on their biotinylation despite their high conservation in biotin enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1563035586,"Activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) or protein kinase C (PKC) causes a rapid desensitization of beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) stimulation of adenylylcyclase in L cells, which previous studies suggest involves the cAPK/PKC consensus phosphorylation site in the third intracellular loop of the beta AR, RRSSK263. To determine the role of the individual serines in the cAPK- and PKC-mediated desensitizations, wild type (WT) and mutant beta ARs containing the substitutions, Ser261-->Ala, Ser262-->Ala, Ser262-->Asp, and Ser261/262-->Ala, were constructed and stably transfected into L cells. Results showed that serine 262 was the primary site of the cAPK-induced desensitization, whereas either serine 261 or serine 262 was sufficient to confer the 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA)/PKC-mediated desensitization. Coincident stimulation of cAPK and PKC caused an additive desensitization (6-8-fold increase in the EC50) which was significantly reduced (80%) only by the double substitution mutation. Quantitative evaluation of the coupling efficiencies and the GTP-shift of the WT and mutant receptors demonstrated that only one of the mutants, Ser262-->Ala, was partially uncoupled. The Ser262-->Asp mutation did not significantly uncouple, demonstrating that introducing a negative charge did not appear to mimic the desensitized state of the receptor. The beta AR expression level played a critical role in determining the pattern of beta AR desensitization; i.e. while the overall desensitization was unaltered within a large range of beta AR expression level (10-300 fmol/mg), the increase in EC50 and decrease in Vmax were differentially affected by the change in the receptor level."
https://openalex.org/W1597326922,"Our characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TATA box-binding protein (TBP) has led to the identification of nine specific yeast TBP-associated factors (TAFs) ranging in size from 170 to 25 kDa. The amino acid sequence derived from a purified TAF with an apparent M(r) of 170,000 indicates that yeast Taf170 is encoded by the essential yeast gene MOT1. We describe in this report a series of experiments that demonstrate that the protein encoded by MOT1 is a bona fide yeast TAF and that Taf170 forms a separate complex with TBP distinct from the RNA polymerase II-specific multisubunit transcription factor IID TBP-TAF complex. The significance of this unique TBP-Taf170 complex regarding transcriptional regulation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1587664920,"The influence of apolipoprotein conformation on the ability of high density lipoprotein (HDL) to remove cellular free cholesterol (FC) has not been studied in detail. To address the effects of amphipathic alpha-helix structure on cellular FC efflux, three class A helical peptides and apolipoprotein (apo) AI were complexed to dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) to make discoidal complexes that were used as acceptors of cell cholesterol. The peptides consisted of an 18-amino acid, amphipathic, alpha-helical peptide with the sequence DWLKAFYDKVAEKLKEAF (18A), a dimer of 18A covalently linked by a proline residue (37pA), and acetyl-18A-amide (Ac-18A-NH2) that has a higher alpha-helix content than the unblocked 18A molecule. The three peptides strongly mimic the lipid-binding characteristics of the amphipathic segments of apolipoproteins and form discoidal complexes with DMPC that are similar in diameter (11-12 nm) to those formed by human apoAI when reconstituted at a 2.5:1 (w:w) phospholipid to protein ratio. The abilities of these complexes to remove radiolabeled FC were compared in experiments using cultured mouse L-cell fibroblasts; efflux of FC from both the plasma membrane and the lysosomal pools was examined. For each of the acceptors, the removal of cholesterol from the plasma membrane and lysosomal pools was equally efficient. All four discoidal complexes were equally efficient cell membrane FC acceptors when compared at saturating acceptor concentrations of > 200 micrograms of DMPC/ml of medium. However, at the same lipid concentration, protein-free DMPC small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were significantly less efficient. The initial rates of FC removal from cells at saturating concentrations of acceptor particles (Vmax) were 12, 10, 10, and 11% per h, respectively, for the complexes containing either 18A, Ac-18A-NH2, 37pA, or apoAI, but only 1% cellular FC per h for the DMPC SUV. The 10-fold higher Vmax for the apoprotein/peptide-containing acceptors was likely due to a reversible interaction of apoprotein or peptide with the plasma membrane that changed the lipid packing characteristics in such a way as to increase the rate of FC desorption from the cell surface. This interaction required amphipathic alpha-helical segments, but it was not affected by the length, number, or lipid-binding affinity of the helices. Furthermore, the efflux efficiency was not dependent on the amino acid sequence of the helical segments which suggests that this interaction is not mediated by a specific cell surface binding site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1575100111,"Prostaglandin G/H synthase (PGHS) is one of the key enzymes in prostaglandin synthesis. Regulation of the mRNA expression of the two isozymes PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 was investigated in mesangial cells. PGHS-1 was constitutively expressed and not modulated by any of the stimuli used. PGHS-2 was induced by the platelet products serotonin (5-HT) and thromboxane A2 (used as its analogue U46619), but not by ATP. Expression of PGHS protein was regulated correspondingly; whereas PGHS-1 protein was constitutively expressed, PGHS-2 protein was virtually absent in unstimulated cells, but could increasingly be induced by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 5-HT, or fetal calf serum. Induction of PGHS-2 mRNA was transient with a peak after 2-3 h. Stimulated mRNA levels persisted for more than 6 h when transcription was inhibited by actinomycin D or when translation was inhibited by cycloheximide. As shown by specific inhibitors, 5-HT signal transduction was mediated by 5-HT2 receptors, which couple to phospholipase C via pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. Induction of PGHS-2 mRNA by 5-HT was dependent on protein kinase C. Down-regulation of the enzyme by prolonged incubation with TPA abolished 5-HT-induced PGHS-2 mRNA expression. Short time activation of protein kinase C by TPA induced PGHS-2 mRNA expression. On the other hand, TPA given immediately before 5-HT decreased the 5-HT-induced PGHS-2 mRNA expression, indicating a negative feedback. The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A reduced induction of PGHS-2 mRNA expression by 5-HT, indicating interference with the signaling cascade, most likely with the Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin. Involvement of Tyr phosphorylation in 5-HT signaling was shown by the Tyr kinase inhibitor genistein, which inhibited the induction, while the Tyr phosphatase inhibitor vanadate by itself was able to induce PGHS-2 mRNA expression, which was further augmented when vanadate was combined with 5-HT. PGHS-2 mRNA expression is thus tightly regulated in mesangial cells and therefore allows modulation at various levels by physiological and pharmacological stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1637242734,"In addition to stimulation of the target gene fatty-acid synthetase, the synthetic progestin R5020 strongly inhibited estradiol-induced pS2 and cathepsin D mRNA levels in MCF7 human breast cancer cells as shown by Northern blot analysis. Inhibition was half-maximal with 30 pM R5020, and the antiprogestin RU486 had only a weak effect. Two human progesterone receptor isoforms have been described; isoform A is a truncated form of isoform B and lacks the 164 N-terminal amino acids. We hypothesized that the two isoforms could have a differential capacity to transrepress estrogen-induced responses. Therefore, in MDA-MB231 cells containing no progesterone and estrogen receptors, we transiently transfected progesterone receptor expression vectors coding for form B (hPR1 or hPR0) or form A (hPR2) along with the estrogen receptor expression vector HEO. We show that R5020 inhibited estradiol-induced transcription of the pS2-CAT reporter plasmid only in cells selectively expressing isoform B. The same results were obtained when progesterone receptor isoforms were overexpressed in MCF7, Ishikawa, HeLa, or NIH-3T3 cells. Transrepression was dependent on the promoter context since the extent of inhibition by isoform B was higher when evaluated with pS2 or cathepsin D nonpalindromic estrogen-responsive element-mediated transcription than with the perfect palindromic form of the vitellogenin gene. Isoform A was inefficient regardless of the reporter construct used. Inhibition varied with the isoform ratio, and isoform B had a dominant effect, with > 70% inhibition measured in cells transfected with the same amount of both progesterone receptor isoforms. Progestin repressed only one of the two transcription activation functions of the estrogen receptor, AF-2, which corresponds to the hormone-binding domain. We conclude that differential expression of progesterone receptor isoforms could be responsible for a tissue-specific inhibition of estrogen target genes by progestins."

To accomplish this goal, a subset of cytosolic CaM-binding proteins (CaMBPs) was partially purified by a combination of DE52 and CaM-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Monoclonal antibodies (CBP-KK1) were used to clone the cDNA for a 53-kDa CaMBP from a lambda ZAP expression library of the metacyclic stage of T. brucei. The deduced amino acid sequence of clone CaMBP-12B had 81% overall amino acid identity to the translation elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) from Euglena gracilis and 76% identity to the rabbit EF-1 alpha. Rabbit EF-1 alpha was recognized by CBP-KK1 and was shown to bind to CaM-Sepharose in a calcium-dependent manner. By contrast, the complex of EF-1 alpha beta gamma did not bind CaM-Sepharose. A heterobifunctional sulfhydryl derivative of CaM (N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate-CaM) formed reducible cross-links with EF-1 alpha in solution but not with the complex of EF-1 alpha beta gamma. Biotinylated CaM bound weakly to trypanosome and rabbit EF-1 alpha in a gel overlay assay. This report demonstrates the direct interaction between CaM and the translation elongation factor EF-1 alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1586044524,"Retinoic acid (RA), we show, induces in peripheral blood mononuclear cells a transient wave of newly transcribed, unstable interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and IL-1 beta mRNA. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA, by contrast, is expressed in multiple waves. IL-1 genes are primary targets for RA. Most IL-1 beta gene transcription induced by RA fails to yield mature mRNA. Instead, precursor transcripts accumulate, detected by ribonuclease protection analysis. The flow of precursors into IL-1 beta mRNA becomes inhibited during induction. When translation is blocked, e.g. by cycloheximide, expression of IL-1 beta mRNA is superinduced by 2 orders of magnitude. Superinduction is dependent on transcription, yet is unaccompanied by increased primary transcription or mRNA stability. Instead, processing of unstable IL-1 beta precursor transcripts into mature mRNA is greatly facilitated. Control is not narrowly localized within precursors: splicing of distinct exons and intron excision are enhanced by cycloheximide. Pre-mRNA processing thus is a limiting step in RA-induced IL-1 beta gene expression. This regulation is specific for RA: when induced by phorbol ester, IL-1 beta gene expression is also superinduced by cycloheximide but that response is accompanied by enhanced mRNA stability. Thus, IL-1 beta gene transcription is induced by RA, yet, unlike for other primary target genes, mRNA expression is regulated at pre-mRNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W1600891454,"Immunoscreening and DNA hybridization were used to isolate a 1.72-kilobase pair cDNA encoding cytosolic NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase from a rat liver, lambda gt11 cDNA library. The identity of the cDNA was confirmed by comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with sequences of peptides obtained from purified ovarian cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase. The 1.72-kilobase pair cDNA sequence translated into a protein of 414 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 46,681 Da. The amino acid sequence contains a tripeptide (AKL) at the COOH terminus which represents a possible peroxisomal targeting sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence of the rat liver cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase showed 70 and 59% identity with sequences reported for NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases from porcine mitochondria and yeast cytosol respectively. Northern blot analysis demonstrated a 13-fold increase in expression of cytosolic NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase mRNA during the gonadotropin-induced development of the immature rat ovary. In comparative studies, the cytosolic and mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase mRNAs were found to differ in size (2.2 and 1.8 kilobases, respectively) and to be differentially expressed in various tissues of the rat. Distinct digestion patterns were also obtained in Southern blot analysis of rat genomic DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1497167336,"Protozoan parasites are incapable of de novo purine biosynthesis and obtain purines by salvage pathways. A nucleoside hydrolase which prefers inosine and uridine as substrates (IU-nucleoside hydrolase) has been characterized and implicated in purine salvage in Crithidia fasciculata (Parkin, D. W., Horenstein, B. A., Abdulah, D. R., Estupinan, B., and Schramm, V. L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 31, 20658-20665). Treatment of C. fasciculata with inhibitors of the IU-nucleoside hydrolase did not prevent cell growth, suggesting alternative enzymes. A guanosine-inosine-preferring enzyme (GI-nucleoside hydrolase) has been purified from extracts of C. fasciculata and characterized. The enzyme is an oligomer of M(r) 38,500 subunits. The Vmax/Km for guanosine, inosine, and adenosine are 3.2 x 10(6), 6.2 x 10(6), and 9.8 M-1 S-1, respectively. Deoxynucleosides, nucleotides, and pyrimidine nucleosides are poor substrates. The pH profile for Km is independent of pH, whereas both Vmax and Vmax/Km demonstrate that a single protonated base, pKa 7.7 is required for activity. The transition state inhibitors of IU-nucleoside hydrolase, 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-1-(S)-phenyl-D-ribitol (Horenstein, B. A., and Schramm, V. L. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 9917-9925) and p-nitrophenylriboamidrazone (Boutellier, M., Horenstein, B. A., Semenyaka, A., Schramm, V.L., and Ganem, B. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 3994-4000), are unexceptional inhibitors of the GI-nucleoside hydrolase. The enzyme is inhibited by 3-deazaadenosine and 2-iodoadenosine with Km/Ki values of 145 and 61, respectively. The results demonstrate that this previously uncharacterized enzyme has distinct structure, kinetic, and chemical mechanisms relative to IU-nucleoside hydrolase. Metabolic studies with labeled inosine as the sole purine source indicated that the GI-enzyme is efficient for purine salvage in vivo."

Immun. 59, 2972-2977) as a probe. Sequencing of the full-length gene revealed an open reading frame that can encode a protein of 699 amino acids. The deduced NH2-terminal amino acid sequence did not correspond with that determined from the purified secretory acid proteinase; however, the encoded protein is antigenically related to secretory acid proteinase and has a putative active site for acid proteinase. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal 215 residues of Acprp is highly similar to the DNA binding domain of Ste12p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gel retardation experiments showed that this region of Acprp, like Ste12p, could bind to S. cerevisiae pheromone response elements, suggesting that Acprp has a function similar to Ste12p. Chimeric constructs composed of S. cerevisiae STE12 and C. albicans ACPR genes complemented the mating defect of S. cerevisiae a or alpha ste12 mutants. Our results suggest the presence of a signal transduction system in C. albicans similar to that of S. cerevisiae mating pathway."

In the presence of a slight excess of dioxygen over ascorbate oxidase, interaction between the trinuclear copper center and O2 is observed even with singly reduced ascorbate oxidase molecules. Under these conditions, the rate constant for intramolecular electron transfer from type 1 Cu(I) to type 3 Cu(II) increases 5-fold to 1100 +/- 300 s-1 (20 degrees C, pH 5.8) as compared to that of the same process under anaerobic conditions. This observation constitutes evidence for control of the internal electron transfer process by one of its substrates. The structural and functional significance of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1573211096,"The gamma chain of the high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E is a member of the T-cell antigen receptor zeta chain family and a functional subunit common to both T-cell and Fc receptors. Here we report that the gamma chain is phosphorylated on threonine in response to protein kinase C activation. Furthermore, the threonine phosphorylation of the gamma chain correlates with the endocytosis of this receptor. We identified a receptor-associated kinase as the calcium-independent protein kinase C-delta and found that it associates with the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the beta chain. In addition, protein kinase C-delta was the only isozyme capable of phosphorylating the gamma chain in vitro. These findings provide evidence for the functional role of protein kinase C-delta in early signal transduction events in the mast cell and suggest a more general mechanism of activation for receptors that share subunits of the zeta chain family."
https://openalex.org/W1581556098,"We have identified, in Xenopus oocyte cytosol, a protein kinase named REKS (Ras-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) stimulator), which phosphorylates and activates recombinant ERK2 through recombinant MEK in a recombinant GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate)-Ras-dependent manner. We show here that this REKS activity is synergistically enhanced by a combination of mammalian recombinant GTP gamma S-KiRas and 14-3-3 protein purified from rat brain. 14-3-3 protein is known to activate tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, to modulate the protein kinase C activity, to stimulate secretion, and to show phospholipase A2 activity per se. 14-3-3 protein did not affect the MEK activity. 14-3-3 protein neither interacted with Ki-Ras nor affected the neurofibromin activity to stimulate the GTPase activity of Ki-Ras under the conditions where the recombinant N-terminal fragment of c-Raf-1 inhibited it. These results suggest that 14-3-3 protein has an additional function in the regulation of the Ras-MEK-ERK cascade pathway through the activation of REKS."

It also inhibited the dephosphorylation of a synthetic tyrosine phosphorylated substrate by recombinant PTP-1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase), indicating that it acted via interaction with PTPase(s). A N-stearyl derivative of the peptide caused an approximately 4.5-fold increase in insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylaction in intact CHO/HIRc cells. The peptide displayed specificity toward tyrosine-class phosphatases only, as it had no effect on the activities of the serine/threonine phosphatases PP-1 and PP-2A, or alkaline phosphatase. The tyrosine sulfate ester bonds of the peptide were stable when incubated with PTP-1B (1 h, 30 degrees C). These data suggest that the sulfotyrosyl peptide functions as a nonhydrolyzable phosphotyrosyl peptide analogue capable of direct interaction with PTPase catalytic domain."

We have succeeded in expressing the 90-kDa mouse R1 protein in Escherichia coli in an active, soluble form using the T7 RNA polymerase pET vector system. To avoid inclusion bodies, the bacteria were grown at 15 degrees C with minimal concentration of the inducer isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside. After a rapid purification procedure, approximately 20 mg of pure R1 protein were obtained per liter of bacterial culture. The concentrated R1 protein solution had a pinkish red color. Spectroscopy in combination with iron and labile sulfur analyses demonstrated that the color originated from an iron-sulfur complex. However, all attempts to demonstrate a function of this complex have been inconclusive. A comparison of the recombinant R1 protein with the corresponding protein purified from calf thymus showed no evidence for glycosylation. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated an alpha-helical content of 50%. A flexible COOH-terminal tail of 7 residues in the R2 protein was earlier shown to be essential for binding to the R1 protein. Using a peptide protection assay and photoaffinity labeling, we now show that the R2 protein tail interacts with a region close to the carboxyl terminus of the R1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1546544159,"The cell division protein FtsZ, essential to initiate septum formation in Escherichia coli, is a GTPase. The thermosensitive ftsZ84 mutation, which impairs the ability of FtsZ to bind and hydrolyze GTP in vitro, maps to a short glycine-rich FtsZ segment. This region is conserved in eubacterial FtsZ homologs and is strikingly similar to the proposed GTP binding motif in the eukaryotic cytoskeletal protein tubulin. Here we show that in contrast to FtsZ, FtsZ84 protein has a Mg(2+)-dependent ATPase activity in vitro. This activity, unlike the wild-type GTPase, is specifically inhibited by sodium azide, a known antagonist of F-type ATPases and the bacterial SecA protein translocation ATPase (Oliver, D., Cabelli, R. J., Dolan, K. M., and Jarosik, G. P. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 8227-8231). Conversely, aluminum fluoride abolishes FtsZ GTPase activity but only partially affects FtsZ84 ATPase. Affinity-purified anti-FtsZ antibody blocks FtsZ84 ATPase activity, indicating that this enzymatic function is intrinsic to the mutant protein. This is, to our knowledge, the first example of a missense mutation that converts a GTPase to an ATPase."

J. 287, 741-747) we isolated and sequenced a cDNA encoding for this protein. The deduced 496 amino acids contain a 17-residue NH2-terminal signal peptide, a KDEL COOH-terminal ER retention signal and two thioredoxin-like active site domains, -CGHC-, identical with those in protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). The sea urchin egg protein shares a 55% sequence identity with mammalian PDI and its PDI activity is 30% of the activity of rabbit liver PDI. The corresponding mRNA was found in oocytes, mature eggs, embryos, and differentiated tissues of the sea urchin in varying amounts. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA, expressed a 58-kDa protein immunoreactive to antibodies against the sea urchin egg protein. This molecule appears to have a dual function of calcium storage and PDI activity within the ER. We hence redesignate it ERcalcistorin/PDI (ECaSt/PDI), a protein that is distinct from calsequestrin and calreticulin."
https://openalex.org/W1591290753,"Human cystatin D is a novel member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine proteinase inhibitors present in saliva and tears. Two alleles of the cystatin D gene (CST5), encoding protein variants with either Cys or Arg as residue 26 in their 122-residue polypeptide chains, are present in the population. Expression of the two alleles was investigated by immunochemical analyses of the secreted cystatin D in saliva from individuals homozygous for each of the two alleles, with results demonstrating that both are expressed at similar levels. The inhibitory characteristics of the two cystatin D variants were studied, by determination of dissociation equilibrium constants (Ki) for their complexes with papain and with the mammalian cysteine proteinases, cathepsins B, H, L, and S. The results demonstrate that 1) cystatin D has a characteristic inhibition profile since it does not inhibit cathepsin B (Ki > 1 microM), and when compared to cystatin C and all other known cystatins it is a much poorer inhibitor of cathepsin L (mean Ki 25 nM) but binds cathepsin H and S relatively tightly (mean Ki values of 8.5 and 0.24 nM, respectively); and 2) the inhibitory activities of the two cystatin D variants are not significantly different, demonstrating that the presence of an extra cysteine residue in the cystatin D molecule affects neither the stability nor the functional activity of the inhibitor, thus explaining the widespread distribution of the Cys26-cystatin D encoding allele in the population. The inhibitory properties displayed by cystatin D suggest that it has a function in saliva as inhibitor of either endogenous or exogenous enzymes with cathepsin S- or H-like properties."

Direct oxidation of the CPA metabolic intermediate aldophosphamide (ALDO) is catalyzed efficiently in vitro by the class 1 ALDH isozyme, but the involvement of the class 3 isozyme in OAP resistance is problematic since in vitro studies do not show efficient oxidation of ALDO. Cell lines were established that express stably transfected rat class 3 ALDH to model the potential role of this isozyme in OAP resistance. Clonogenic survival assay data indicated that even modest expression of rat class 3 ALDH was associated with resistance (2-4-fold) to the CPA analog mafosfamide and that the fold resistance was directly proportional to the class 3 ALDH activity expressed in clonal transfectants. Pretreatment of the highest activity cell line (3A1-31A) with 75 microM diethylaminobenzaldehyde, an ALDH substrate and inhibitor of benzaldehyde oxidation, effectively reversed the 3.8-fold resistance in this line; drug sensitivity was unaffected by diethylaminobenzaldehyde in the control transfected cell line. The resistance conferred by ALDH to mafosfamide is OAP-specific since the 3A1-31A line is also resistant to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (2.9-fold) and 4-hydroperoxyifosfamide (3.2-fold) but not to the non-oxazaphosphorine drugs phosphoramide mustard and melphalan, which cannot be detoxified by aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W32541012,"The human growth hormone/human chorionic somatomammotropin (hGH/hCS) gene cluster contains five genes: hGH-N, hGH-V, hCS-A, hCS-B, and hCS-L. The expression of the first four genes has been well documented. In contrast, the hCS-L gene has been considered a pseudogene inactivated by loss of the normal intron 2 splice donor site. Previously our laboratory has shown that hCS-L transcripts are present in human placenta and that their levels are induced during the second trimester. More detailed studies of hCS-L transcript processing and mRNA structure are hindered by overwhelming levels of the structurally similar hCS-A and hCS-B transcripts in the placenta. To circumvent this problem, we have established stably transfected cell lines selectively expressing the hCS-L gene. Analysis of hCS-L mRNA from these cell lines demonstrates at least five major alternative splicing pathways, four of which could be confirmed qualitatively by parallel analysis of placental RNA. This analysis reveals an unexpectedly high frequency of exon 2 skipping (73%) as well as utilization of three competing exon 3 splice acceptor sites. Since exon 2 encodes the signal peptide, the majority of hCS-L transcripts are unable to express a secreted protein. Three of the defined hCS-L mRNAs contain an extended open reading frame similar to that present in the functional GH and CS genes. All three of these hCS-L transcripts are of minor abundance and only two, hCS-L(L) and hCS-L(L'), contain exon 2. In vitro translation and signal peptide processing of hCS-L(L) mRNA yields a 20-kDa hCS-L isoform in vitro. These data confirm the placental expression of the hCS-L gene, demonstrate surprising complexity in the splicing of its transcripts, predict that the majority of processed hCS-L mRNAs are nonfunctional, and identify specific, low abundance mRNAs that may encode novel gestational hormones."

https://openalex.org/W1648689484,"pip92 is an immediate early gene that is transcriptionally activated in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts upon treatment with serum growth factors or the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Here we show that a 73-base pair pip92 promoter fragment located between base pairs 1231 and 1158 upstream of the transcription start site is sufficient to mediate transcriptional activation. This promoter fragment contains two binding sites for transcription factors of the Ets family and a low affinity binding site for the serum response factor. The minimal sequence that mediates serum induction includes at least one copy of the Ets-binding site and a low affinity binding site for the serum response factor. This sequence can interact with at least two proteins in a fibroblast nuclear extract that have binding characteristics of an Ets family protein and a serum response factor-like protein. These proteins can bind the pip92-inducible element simultaneously, thus forming a ternary complex. Furthermore, the same element interacts with recombinant serum response factor and Elk1 proteins individually as well as simultaneously to form a ternary complex. This mode of ternary complex formation is in contrast to the one seen in the promoter of the c-fos protooncogene, where formation of the ternary complex is dependent on the prior assembly of the serum response factor-DNA binary complex. The activation of a number of immediate early genes appears to be mediated through a ternary complex involving members of the Ets family of transcription factors and the serum response factor. We propose that different mechanisms can lead to the formation of such ternary complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1608285494,"The functional consequences of Arg-242 to Ser or Lys substitutions in type I alpha regulatory (R) subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase were analyzed by using recombinant murine R subunits expressed in Escherichia coli. These mutations arose in cAMP-resistant mutants to S49 mouse lymphoma cells and were shown previously to inhibit cAMP binding to site A, the more amino-terminal of two intrachain cAMP-binding sites. Binding of cAMP to site A of the mutant R subunits could be detected by cAMP-dependent quenching of endogenous tryptophan fluorescence, [3H]cAMP binding to mutant R subunits with the Arg-242 mutations without or with an inactivating mutation in site B, or biphasic dissociation of [3H]cAMP from the mutant subunits at low temperature. The mutations reduced site A affinities by about 25-fold, and the reductions were attributable to accelerated rates of cAMP dissociation. While the presence of cAMP in site A retards dissociation of [3H]cAMP from site B of wild-type R subunits, saturation of site A had little or no effect on dissociation of [3H]cAMP from site B of the mutant subunits. The predominant effect of the mutations, therefore, was loss of allosteric coupling between the two cAMP-binding sites. A second allosteric interaction, that coupling occupation of site A with a reduced affinity of R for catalytic subunit, was inhibited only partially by these mutations at Arg-242."
https://openalex.org/W138157765,"Cholesterol loading of macrophages, such as occurs in atheroma foam cells, has recently been shown to upregulate a novel receptor activity that mediates the internalization degradation of the atherogenic lipoprotein, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), and its protein moiety, apoprotein(a), (apo(a)). Herein, the regulation of this receptor activity by macrophage activation and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was investigated. Compared with control foam cells, 125I-recombinant-apo(a) (r-apo(a)) degradation assayed after 5 h of incubation was 3-6-fold less in foam cells derived from thioglycollate- or concanavalin A-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages. In vitro treatment of foam cells derived from resident mouse peritoneal macrophages or from human monocyte-derived macrophages with IFN-gamma also led to a substantial decrease in the ability of these cells to degrade 125I-rapo(a); similar results were obtained with 125I-Lp(a). In contrast, IFN-gamma-treated foam cells that were incubated for 10 min with 125I-r-apo(a) and then chased for 2 h in the absence of ligand degraded similar amounts of 125I-r-apo(a) as untreated foam cells. To reconcile these data, we hypothesized that the apo(a) receptor activity undergoes ligand-induced recycling and that IFN-gamma disrupts this recycling. To test this idea, control and IFN-gamma-treated foam cells were incubated for 10 min with unlabeled r-apo(a), and then 125I-r-apo(a) receptor activity was assayed at various times thereafter. Untreated foam cells showed clear evidence of ligand-induced recycling of the apo(a) receptor activity, whereas recycling was markedly diminished in the IFN-gamma-treated foam cells. Thus, by disrupting ligand-induced receptor recycling, IFN-gamma leads to down-regulation of the foam cell Lp(a)/apo(a) receptor activity. Since T cells are known to be present in atherosclerotic lesions, these findings raise the possibility that the degradation by atheroma foam cells of Lp(a) and other possible ligands for the receptor may be reversibly regulated by IFN-gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1497413258,"To elucidate the interactions between residues found in the active-site cavity of human carbonic anhydrase III, we have prepared a series of single and double mutants with Lys-64, Arg-67, and Phe-198 replaced with Ala, Asp, Glu, His, and Leu. Rates of catalysis were determined using 18O exchange between CO2 and water measured by mass spectrometry and initial velocity measured by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Replacement of these residues resulted in increases in kcat/Km for CO2 hydration as much as 200-fold and increases in the pKa of the zinc-bound water by as much as 3.5 units. We conclude that the effect of replacements made at positions 64, 67, and 198 were in general additive for kcat/Km for CO2 hydration, indicating that there is no interaction between these sites that affects the catalytic interconversion of CO2 and HCO3-. One notable exception is the antagonism exhibited by the double mutant of human carbonic anhydrase III containing Glu-64 and Leu-198. The data also show that one source of the large enhancement of kcat/Km for the mutant containing Asp-198 in human carbonic anhydrase III is the presence of both Asp-198 and Lys-64; when Lys-64 was replaced with Ala, a reduction of catalytic activity was observed. These results provide an additional view of the independent interactions of amino acids that affect the catalytic pathway of isozyme III, the least active of the known carbonic anhydrase isozymes."

Removal of these cations reduces the stability of proteinase K as shown by thermal denaturation, but the proteolytic activity is unchanged. The x-ray structures of native and Ca(2+)-free proteinase K at 1.5-A resolution show that there are no cuts in the polypeptide backbone (i.e. no autolysis), Ca 1 has been replaced by Na+, while Ca 2 has been substituted by a water associated with a larger but locally confined structural change at that site. A small but concerted geometrical shift is transmitted from the Ca 1 site via eight secondary structure elements to the substrate recognition site (Gly100-Tyr104, and Ser132-Gly136) but not to the catalytic triad (Asp39,His69,Ser224). This is accompanied by positional changes of localized waters."
https://openalex.org/W1558404952,"The fluorescence properties of porphyrin were compared in protoporphyrin-protoheme hybrid hemoglobins (Hb) in which the protohemes (Fe) in either the alpha or beta subunits were substituted with protoporphyrin IX, alpha (P)2 beta (Fe)2-Hb and alpha (Fe)2 beta(P)2-Hb, respectively. The fluorescence lifetimes of the porphyrin in these hybrid derivatives are shorter than for the tetra-substituted protoporphyrin Hb, indicating that there is energy transfer from the porphyrin to the heme. The energy transfer resulted in only approximately 20% diminution of donor fluorescence, thereby allowing for the examination by fluorescence of the interaction of porphyrin with a given subunit peptide chain. Fluorescence line-narrowing spectroscopy, a high resolution fluorescence technique that involves laser excitation, produced vibrationally resolved emission spectra in which the zero phonon lines were separated from a broadened background consisting of phonon wings. Resolved spectra were obtained in the temperature range of 5-50 K; above 70 K the spectra were unresolved. By changing the excitation frequency the mean energy of the 0,0 transition, characterizing the separation in energy between the ground and excited states, can be determined. For both derivatives a bimodal distribution was seen, indicating that more than one conformation of molecules was present. The distribution of 0,0 transition energies of the porphyrin in the beta-chain in alpha(Fe)2 beta(P)2-Hb was shifted to lower energy relative to the alpha chain in alpha(P)2 beta(P)2-Hb, whereas the excited state molecules in the two subunits had very little difference in vibrational energy. These data point to the same configuration of the porphyrins in the two sites, but differences in the electric field for the alpha and beta subunits."
