https://openalex.org/W2793543443,"Materials research has driven the development of modern nano-electronic devices. In particular, research in magnetic thin films has revolutionized the development of spintronic devices1,2 because identifying new magnetic materials is key to better device performance and design. Van der Waals crystals retain their chemical stability and structural integrity down to the monolayer and, being atomically thin, are readily tuned by various kinds of gate modulation3,4. Recent experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to obtain two-dimensional ferromagnetic order in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6 (ref. 5) and CrI3 (ref. 6) at low temperatures. Here we develop a device fabrication technique and isolate monolayers from the layered metallic magnet Fe3GeTe2 to study magnetotransport. We find that the itinerant ferromagnetism persists in Fe3GeTe2 down to the monolayer with an out-of-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The ferromagnetic transition temperature, Tc, is suppressed relative to the bulk Tc of 205 kelvin in pristine Fe3GeTe2 thin flakes. An ionic gate, however, raises Tc to room temperature, much higher than the bulk Tc. The gate-tunable room-temperature ferromagnetism in two-dimensional Fe3GeTe2 opens up opportunities for potential voltage-controlled magnetoelectronics7–11 based on atomically thin van der Waals crystals. Monolayers of Fe3GeTe2 exhibit itinerant ferromagnetism with an out-of-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy; ionic gating raises the ferromagnetic transition temperature of few-layer Fe3GeTe2 to room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2896893468,"Sepsis is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the main cause of mortality in hospitals1–3, but the best treatment strategy remains uncertain. In particular, evidence suggests that current practices in the administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors are suboptimal and likely induce harm in a proportion of patients1,4–6. To tackle this sequential decision-making problem, we developed a reinforcement learning agent, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Clinician, which extracted implicit knowledge from an amount of patient data that exceeds by many-fold the life-time experience of human clinicians and learned optimal treatment by analyzing a myriad of (mostly suboptimal) treatment decisions. We demonstrate that the value of the AI Clinician’s selected treatment is on average reliably higher than human clinicians. In a large validation cohort independent of the training data, mortality was lowest in patients for whom clinicians’ actual doses matched the AI decisions. Our model provides individualized and clinically interpretable treatment decisions for sepsis that could improve patient outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2897570487,"MALAT1 has previously been described as a metastasis-promoting long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). We show here, however, that targeted inactivation of the Malat1 gene in a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, without altering the expression of its adjacent genes, promotes lung metastasis, and that this phenotype can be reversed by genetic add-back of Malat1. Similarly, knockout of MALAT1 in human breast cancer cells induces their metastatic ability, which is reversed by re-expression of Malat1. Conversely, overexpression of Malat1 suppresses breast cancer metastasis in transgenic, xenograft, and syngeneic models. Mechanistically, the MALAT1 lncRNA binds and inactivates the prometastatic transcription factor TEAD, preventing TEAD from associating with its co-activator YAP and target gene promoters. Moreover, MALAT1 levels inversely correlate with breast cancer progression and metastatic ability. These findings demonstrate that MALAT1 is a metastasis-suppressing lncRNA rather than a metastasis promoter in breast cancer, calling for rectification of the model for this highly abundant and conserved lncRNA. Targeted inactivation, restoration and overexpression of MALAT1 in multiple in vivo models demonstrate that the lncRNA MALAT1 suppresses breast cancer metastasis through binding and inactivation of the pro-metastatic transcription factor TEAD."
https://openalex.org/W2950885009,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci contributing to variation in complex traits, yet the majority of loci that contribute to the heritability of complex traits remain elusive. Large study populations with sufficient statistical power are required to detect the small effect sizes of the yet unidentified genetic variants. However, the analysis of huge cohorts, like UK Biobank, is challenging. Here, we present an atlas of genetic associations for 118 non-binary and 660 binary traits of 452,264 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Results are compiled in a publicly accessible database that allows querying genome-wide association results for 9,113,133 genetic variants, as well as downloading GWAS summary statistics for over 30 million imputed genetic variants (>23 billion phenotype–genotype pairs). Our atlas of associations (GeneATLAS, http://geneatlas.roslin.ed.ac.uk ) will help researchers to query UK Biobank results in an easy and uniform way without the need to incur high computational costs. GeneATLAS is a web resource that presents genetic association results for 118 non-binary and 660 binary traits using UK Biobank data. This atlas allows researchers to query these results without incurring high computational costs."
https://openalex.org/W2952504784,"To make decisions, animals must evaluate candidate choices by accessing memories of relevant experiences. Yet little is known about which experiences are considered or ignored during deliberation, which ultimately governs choice. We propose a normative theory predicting which memories should be accessed at each moment to optimize future decisions. Using nonlocal 'replay' of spatial locations in hippocampus as a window into memory access, we simulate a spatial navigation task in which an agent accesses memories of locations sequentially, ordered by utility: how much extra reward would be earned due to better choices. This prioritization balances two desiderata: the need to evaluate imminent choices versus the gain from propagating newly encountered information to preceding locations. Our theory offers a simple explanation for numerous findings about place cells; unifies seemingly disparate proposed functions of replay including planning, learning, and consolidation; and posits a mechanism whose dysfunction may underlie pathologies like rumination and craving."
https://openalex.org/W2897661414,"Aspergillus section Nigri comprises filamentous fungi relevant to biomedicine, bioenergy, health, and biotechnology. To learn more about what genetically sets these species apart, as well as about potential applications in biotechnology and biomedicine, we sequenced 23 genomes de novo, forming a full genome compendium for the section (26 species), as well as 6 Aspergillus niger isolates. This allowed us to quantify both inter- and intraspecies genomic variation. We further predicted 17,903 carbohydrate-active enzymes and 2,717 secondary metabolite gene clusters, which we condensed into 455 distinct families corresponding to compound classes, 49% of which are only found in single species. We performed metabolomics and genetic engineering to correlate genotypes to phenotypes, as demonstrated for the metabolite aurasperone, and by heterologous transfer of citrate production to Aspergillus nidulans. Experimental and computational analyses showed that both secondary metabolism and regulation are key factors that are significant in the delineation of Aspergillus species."
https://openalex.org/W2896025743,"We quantified genome-wide patterns of lysine H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in entorhinal cortex samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases and matched controls using chromatin immunoprecipitation and highly parallel sequencing. We observed widespread acetylomic variation associated with AD neuropathology, identifying 4,162 differential peaks (false discovery rate < 0.05) between AD cases and controls. Differentially acetylated peaks were enriched in disease-related biological pathways and included regions annotated to genes involved in the progression of amyloid-β and tau pathology (for example, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and MAPT), as well as regions containing variants associated with sporadic late-onset AD. Partitioned heritability analysis highlighted a highly significant enrichment of AD risk variants in entorhinal cortex H3K27ac peak regions. AD-associated variable H3K27ac was associated with transcriptional variation at proximal genes including CR1, GPR22, KMO, PIM3, PSEN1, and RGCC. In addition to identifying molecular pathways associated with AD neuropathology, we present a framework for genome-wide studies of histone modifications in complex disease."

https://openalex.org/W2896399042,"The human genome encodes a variety of poorly understood RNA species that remain challenging to identify using existing genomic tools. We developed chromatin run-on and sequencing (ChRO-seq) to map the location of RNA polymerase for almost any input sample, including samples with degraded RNA that are intractable to RNA sequencing. We used ChRO-seq to map nascent transcription in primary human glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumors. Enhancers identified in primary GBMs resemble open chromatin in the normal human brain. Rare enhancers that are activated in malignant tissue drive regulatory programs similar to the developing nervous system. We identified enhancers that regulate groups of genes that are characteristic of each known GBM subtype and transcription factors that drive them. Finally we discovered a core group of transcription factors that control the expression of genes associated with clinical outcomes. This study characterizes the transcriptional landscape of GBM and introduces ChRO-seq as a method to map regulatory programs that contribute to complex diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2897250433,"Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) has been found at both promoters and distal enhancers, suggesting additional functions beyond mRNA production. To understand this role, we sequenced nascent RNAs at single-molecule resolution to unravel the interplay between Pol II initiation, capping and pausing genome-wide. Our analyses identify two pause classes that are associated with different RNA capping profiles. More proximal pausing is associated with less complete capping, less elongation and a more enhancer-like complement of transcription factors than later pausing. Unexpectedly, transcription start sites (TSSs) are predominantly found in constellations composed of multiple divergent pairs. TSS clusters are intimately associated with precise arrays of nucleosomes and correspond with boundaries of transcription factor binding and chromatin modification at promoters and enhancers. TSS architecture is largely unchanged during the dramatic transcriptional changes induced by heat shock. Together, our results suggest that promoter- and enhancer-associated Pol II is a regulatory nexus for integrating information across TSS ensembles."
https://openalex.org/W2896400030,"The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is known to contain spatial encoding neurons that likely contribute to encoding spatial aspects of episodic memories. However, little is known about the role MEC plays in encoding temporal aspects of episodic memories, particularly during immobility. Here using a virtual 'Door Stop' task for mice, we show that MEC contains a representation of elapsed time during immobility, with individual time-encoding neurons activated at a specific moment during the immobile interval. This representation consisted of a sequential activation of time-encoding neurons and displayed variations in progression speed that correlated with variations in mouse timing behavior. Time- and space-encoding neurons were preferentially active during immobile and locomotion periods, respectively, were anatomically clustered with respect to each other, and preferentially encoded the same variable across tasks or environments. These results suggest the existence of largely non-overlapping subcircuits in MEC encoding time during immobility or space during locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2897717946,Animals strategically scan the environment to form an accurate perception of their surroundings. Here we investigated the neuronal representations that mediate this behavior. Ca2+ imaging and selective optogenetic manipulation during an active sensing task reveals that layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the vibrissae cortex produce a diverse and distributed representation that is required for mice to adapt their whisking motor strategy to changing sensory cues. The optogenetic perturbation degraded single-neuron selectivity and network population encoding through a selective inhibition of active dendritic integration. Together the data indicate that active dendritic integration in pyramidal neurons produces a nonlinearly mixed network representation of joint sensorimotor parameters that is used to transform sensory information into motor commands during adaptive behavior. The prevalence of the layer 5 cortical circuit motif suggests that this is a general circuit computation.
https://openalex.org/W2897480633,"The principles governing the functional organization and development of long-range network interactions in the neocortex remain poorly understood. Using in vivo widefield and two-photon calcium imaging of spontaneous activity patterns in mature ferret visual cortex, we find widespread modular correlation patterns that accurately predict the local structure of visually evoked orientation columns several millimeters away. Longitudinal imaging demonstrates that long-range spontaneous correlations are present early in cortical development before the elaboration of horizontal connections and predict mature network structure. Silencing feedforward drive through retinal or thalamic blockade does not eliminate early long-range correlated activity, suggesting a cortical origin. Circuit models containing only local, but heterogeneous, connections are sufficient to generate long-range correlated activity by confining activity patterns to a low-dimensional subspace via multisynaptic short-range interactions. These results suggest that local connections in early cortical circuits can generate structured long-range network correlations that guide the formation of visually evoked distributed functional networks. Distributed networks in visual cortex precisely link the fine-scale functional architecture with distant network elements and appear early in development, when heterogeneous local connections may seed long-range network interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2897444845,"The formation and retrieval of conditioned fear memories critically depend on the amygdala. Here we identify an inhibitory projection from somatostatin-positive neurons in the central amygdala to parvalbumin-positive neurons in the zona incerta that is required for both recent and remote fear memories. Thus, the amygdala inhibitory input to parvalbumin-positive neurons in the zona incerta, a nucleus not previously implicated in fear memory, is an essential component of the fear memory circuitry. Using genetic tools of neural circuit tracing and manipulation, we identify a novel projection from the amygdala to the zona incerta—a nucleus not previously implicated in fear memory—that is essential for recent and remote fear memories."
https://openalex.org/W2897570668,"Bombesin-like receptor 3 (BRS3) is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor that regulates energy homeostasis and heart rate. We report that acute activation of Brs3-expressing neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMHBrs3) increased body temperature (Tb), brown adipose tissue temperature, energy expenditure, heart rate, and blood pressure, with no effect on food intake or physical activity. Conversely, activation of Brs3 neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus had no effect on Tb or energy expenditure, but suppressed food intake. Inhibition of DMHBrs3 neurons decreased Tb and energy expenditure, suggesting a necessary role in Tb regulation. We found that the preoptic area provides major input (excitatory and inhibitory) to DMHBrs3 neurons. Optogenetic stimulation of DMHBrs3 projections to the raphe pallidus increased Tb. Thus, DMHBrs3→raphe pallidus neurons regulate Tb, energy expenditure, and heart rate, and Brs3 neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus regulate food intake. Brs3 expression is a useful marker for delineating energy metabolism regulatory circuitry."

https://openalex.org/W2897212208,"Sleep cycles consist of rapid alterations between arousal states, including transient perturbation of sleep rhythms, microarousals, and full-blown awake states. Here we demonstrate that the calretinin (CR)-containing neurons in the dorsal medial thalamus (DMT) constitute a key diencephalic node that mediates distinct levels of forebrain arousal. Cell-type-specific activation of DMT/CR+ cells elicited active locomotion lasting for minutes, stereotyped microarousals, or transient disruption of sleep rhythms, depending on the parameters of the stimulation. State transitions could be induced in both slow-wave and rapid eye-movement sleep. The DMT/CR+ cells displayed elevated activity before arousal, received selective subcortical inputs, and innervated several forebrain sites via highly branched axons. Together, these features enable DMT/CR+ cells to summate subcortical arousal information and effectively transfer it as a rapid, synchronous signal to several forebrain regions to modulate the level of arousal. Mátyás, Komlósi, et al. describe a highly specialized, calretinin-containing cell population in the dorsal medial thalamus. Connectivity, activity, and optogenetic manipulations identify these neurons as key mediators of forebrain arousal."
https://openalex.org/W2896667872,"Identifying immunodominant T cell epitopes remains a significant challenge in the context of infectious disease, autoimmunity, and immuno-oncology. To address the challenge of antigen discovery, we developed a quantitative proteomic approach that enabled unbiased identification of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)-associated peptide epitopes and biochemical features of antigenicity. On the basis of these data, we trained a deep neural network model for genome-scale predictions of immunodominant MHCII-restricted epitopes. We named this model bacteria originated T cell antigen (BOTA) predictor. In validation studies, BOTA accurately predicted novel CD4 T cell epitopes derived from the model pathogen Listeria monocytogenes and the commensal microorganism Muribaculum intestinale. To conclusively define immunodominant T cell epitopes predicted by BOTA, we developed a high-throughput approach to screen DNA-encoded peptide-MHCII libraries for functional recognition by T cell receptors identified from single-cell RNA sequencing. Collectively, these studies provide a framework for defining the immunodominance landscape across a broad range of immune pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2898082362,"Breast cancer is one of the most dangerous and frequently occurring cancers among women, and it also affects men. We aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with mortality among patients with breast cancer in Saudi Arabia.Data for this analysis of breast cancer mortality among Saudi Arabians were obtained from the Saudi Arabian Cancer Registry at the King Faisal Hospital and Research Centre. Both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted using proportions, chi-squared tests, and the Cox regression model. Frequentist and Bayesian inferential statistics were used to estimate the risk ratios. A frailty term was specified to control for suspected heterogeneity across regions. Bayesian and deviance information criteria were used to discriminate between the frequentist and Bayesian frailty models, respectively.Out of 5,411 patients, 708 (13.08%) deaths occurred that were attributable to breast cancer. Of those, 12 (1.69%) were men. Among patients who died of breast cancer, 353 (49.86%) had tumours that originated on the left side and 338 (47.74%) on the right side. In terms of the stage or extent of breast cancer, 318 (44.92%) deaths occurred among patients who had distant metastases, followed by 304 (42.94%) who had regional metastases and 86 (12.15%) with localized cancers. Men were 72% more likely than women to die from breast cancer. Divorcees were twice as likely to die, compared to their married counterparts. Patients whose tumours were classified as Grade IV had the highest mortality rate, which was 5.0 times higher than patients with Grade I tumours (credible interval (CrI); 1.577, 14.085) and 3.7 times higher than patients with Grade II tumours (CrI; 1.205, 9.434).There is a high prevalence of breast cancer mortality among Saudi Arabian women, with the highest prevalence among divorced women. Though the prevalence of breast cancer mortality among men is lower than that of women, men had a higher risk of death. We therefore recommend an intensive health education programme for both men and women. These programmes should discuss the consequences of divorce, the prevalence of breast cancer among men, and early diagnoses and treatments for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2896312705,"Humans and other primates sample the visual environment using saccadic eye movements that shift a high-resolution fovea toward regions of interest to create a clear perception of a scene across fixations. Many mammals, however, like mice, lack a fovea, which raises the question of why they make saccades. Here we describe and test the hypothesis that saccades are matched to natural scene statistics and to the receptive field sizes and adaptive properties of neural populations. Specifically, we determined the minimum amplitude of saccades in natural scenes necessary to provide uncorrelated inputs to model neural populations. This analysis predicts the distributions of observed saccade sizes during passive viewing for nonhuman primates, cats, and mice. Furthermore, disrupting the development of receptive field properties by monocular deprivation changed saccade sizes consistent with this hypothesis. Therefore, natural-scene statistics and the neural representation of natural images appear to be critical factors guiding saccadic eye movements."
https://openalex.org/W2883667768,"Small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones, and sHsp mutations or altered expression are linked to multiple human disease states. sHsp monomers assemble into large oligomers with dimeric substructure, and the dynamics of sHsp oligomers has led to major questions about the form that captures substrate, a critical aspect of their mechanism of action. We show here that substructural dimers of two plant dodecameric sHsps, Ta16.9 and homologous Ps18.1, are functional units in the initial encounter with unfolding substrate. We introduced inter-polypeptide disulfide bonds at the two dodecameric interfaces, dimeric and nondimeric, to restrict how their assemblies can dissociate. When disulfide-bonded at the nondimeric interface, mutants of Ta16.9 and Ps18.1 (TaCT-ACD and PsCT-ACD) were inactive but, when reduced, had WT-like chaperone activity, demonstrating that dissociation at nondimeric interfaces is essential for sHsp activity. Moreover, the size of the TaCT-ACD and PsCT-ACD covalent unit defined a new tetrahedral geometry for these sHsps, different from that observed in the Ta16.9 X-ray structure. Importantly, oxidized Tadimer (disulfide bonded at the dimeric interface) exhibited greatly enhanced ability to protect substrate, indicating that strengthening the dimeric interface increases chaperone efficiency. Temperature-induced size and secondary structure changes revealed that folded sHsp dimers interact with substrate and that dimer stability affects chaperone efficiency. These results yield a model in which sHsp dimers capture substrate before assembly into larger, heterogeneous sHsp–substrate complexes for substrate refolding or degradation, and suggest that tuning the strength of the dimer interface can be used to engineer sHsp chaperone efficiency.

Although vertebrate sHsps assemble principally as polydisperse oligomers, some bacterial, yeast, and plant sHsps are monodisperse. In all oligomeric forms, sHsp dimers interact through a conserved interface between an I-X-I motif in the CT and a groove formed by β4 and β8 in the ACD of a monomer in another dimer (hereafter the CT-ACD interface) (1Basha E.

Although the above studies suggest that substructural dimers of these sHsps interact with substrates, there is no direct evidence for sHsp dissociation being essential for activity, or for dimers being important for substrate capture. To address the mechanism of substrate protection by sHsps, we engineered disulfide bridges that prevent dissociation at either of the two major oligomeric interfaces, dimeric and nondimeric, in the Ta16.9 and Ps18.1 dodecamers, and tested their activity in protecting a heat-sensitive protein, malate dehydrogenase (MDH). The mutants led us to re-examine the quaternary structures of Ta16.9 and Ps18.1 and support the conclusions that sHsps need to dissociate at specific interfaces to protect substrate, and that free, folded dimers are the active substrate-capturing units. To test the functional importance of sHsp oligomer dynamics, we made cysteine mutant pairs in Ta16.9 and Ps18.1 to prevent dissociation at the nondimeric or dimeric interfaces. To link the nondimeric interfaces, cysteine residues were introduced to create a disulfide bridge between the CT of one monomer and β4 of the ACD from a monomer in another dimer (Fig. 1A). Of cysteine pairs tested, the mutants E74C V144C Ta16.9 (TaCT-ACD) and E81C V151C Ps18.1 (PsCT-ACD) were soluble and purified as dodecamers (Table S1, Fig. S1). To prevent dissociation at the dimeric interface, cysteines were introduced in a nonhydrogen-bonded registered pair between β6 on one monomer and β2 of the partner subunit such that the resulting disulfide-bonded dodecamer would dissociate into six covalent dimers when oxidized (Fig. 1A). The mutant K49C W96C Ta16.9 (Tadimer) was soluble and purified as a dodecamer; we were unable to create an analogous, dodecameric Psdimer (Table S1), and studies on this interface are confined to the Tadimer protein. This interface, which involves strand-swapping between ACDs, is characteristic of plant, bacterial, and yeast sHsps (3Haslbeck M. Vierling E.

Among Kv channels, KCNQ1–5 (Kv7.1–7.5) channels are regulated by several intracellular signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is present in the inner leaflet of the cell plasma membrane at only modest abundance. For some time, it has been known that interactions with PIP2 regulate M-channel activity (2Suh B.C. Hille B.

However, the answers to several key questions remain elusive: How and where does PIP2 regulate KCNQ channels, and are those mechanisms disparate between KCNQ1-containing channels and the others, or do they generalize among KCNQ1–5? To understand the molecular mechanisms by which PIP2 regulates KCNQ channels, it is necessary to identify the site(s) of PIP2 interaction. Kv channels are tetramers of subunits containing six transmembrane domains (S1–S6). The earliest study suggested that PIP2 interacts with the junction between S6 and the first C-terminal “A helix” (which we call the S6Jx domain) of KCNQ2; thus, replacement of the histidine at position 328 in the S6Jx of KCNQ2 (His367 in KCNQ3; Fig. 1A) by a cysteine reduced the sensitivity of the channel to PIP2 (4Zhang H. Craciun L.C. Mirshahi T. Rohács T. Lopes C.M. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. PIP2 activates KCNQ channels, and its hydrolysis underlies receptor-mediated inhibition of M currents.Neuron. 2003; 37 (12670425): 963-97510.1016/S0896-6273(03)00125-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We identified a “cationic cluster” (Lys452, Arg459, and Arg461 in KCNQ2) in the linker between the A and B helices (A–B linker) of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, which were suggested to form electrostatic bonds with the phosphate headgroups of PIP2 molecules (8Hernandez C.C. Zaika O. Shapiro M.S. A carboxy-terminal inter-helix linker as the site of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate action on Kv7 (M-type) K+ channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132 (18725531): 361-38110.1085/jgp.200810007Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Expanding on those findings, Tinker and co-workers (9Thomas A.M. Harmer S.C. Khambra T. Tinker A. Characterization of a binding site for anionic phospholipids on KCNQ1.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (21084310): 2088-210010.1074/jbc.M110.153551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) localized a cluster of basic residues (Lys354, Lys358, Arg360, and Lys362) in the S6Jx of KCNQ1 channels. In KCNQ3, the analogous Lys358, Gln362, Arg364, and Lys366 residues (Fig. 1A) were suggested to interact with PIP2. More recent work has suggested two additional domains that interact with PIP2 and regulate gating, the linker between transmembrane helices S2 and S3 (S2–S3 linker) and between the S4 and S5 helices (S4–S5 linker), domains in KCNQ1 channels whose interactions with PIP2 were suggested moreover to be important for coupling between the voltage sensor and the gate (10Zaydman M.A. Silva J.R.

Lastly, a recent study based heavily on molecular dynamics simulations suggested state-dependent interactions between PIP2 and the S2–S3 and S4–S5 linkers of KCNQ2 channels that were weakly coupled to the voltage dependence of activation (11Zhang Q. Zhou P. Chen Z. Li M. Jiang H. Gao Z. Yang H. Dynamic PIP2 interactions with voltage sensor elements contribute to KCNQ2 channel gating.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lending support for a generalized structural interaction between PIP2 and the region just distal to the final transmembrane helix of K+ channels is the crystal structure of PIP2 bound to the Kir2.2 channel (12Hansen S.B. Tao X. MacKinnon R. Structural basis of PIP2 activation of the classical inward rectifier K+ channel Kir2.2.Nature. 2011; 477 (21874019): 495-49810.1038/nature10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), which shows a PIP2 molecule interacting with residues not only in the proximal C terminus as it emerges from the lipid bilayer, but also residues at the distal end of the M2 helix. Thus, it behooved us to more systematically examine all of these regions of a KCNQ channel most amenable to study via a voltage-dependent phosphatase (VSP), which can dephosphorylate nearly all of the PIP2 in the plasma membrane within about 500 ms (13Murata Y. Okamura Y. Depolarization activates the phosphoinositide phosphatase Ci-VSP, as detected in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing sensors of PIP2.J.

This method has been exploited to examine the PIP2 sensitivity of KCNQ (14Falkenburger B.H. Jensen J.B. Hille B.

Most significantly, unlike reducing PIP2 abundance by stimulating Gq– and phospholipase C–coupled receptors, which could also produce inositol triphosphate, Ca2+ rises, activate protein kinase C and induce other downstream signals, activation of VSP only dephosphorylates PIP2 to PI(4)P, a singly phosphorylated lipid that does not allow activation of M channels (17Telezhkin V.

The Hille group (14Falkenburger B.H. Jensen J.B. Hille B. Kinetics of PIP2 metabolism and KCNQ2/3 channel regulation studied with a voltage-sensitive phosphatase in living cells.J. Gen. Physiol. 2010; 135 (20100891): 99-11410.1085/jgp.200910345Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) studied KCNQ2/3 heteromers and found the time constant of dephosphorylation of available PIP2 in the membrane of a tissue culture cell to be ∼250 ms; in that work, while not quantifying the kon or koff of PIP2, they found a “dwell time” of ∼10 ms to be consistent with the modeling of their data, most likely due to the low affinity of KCNQ2 subunits that determine whether KCNQ2/3 channels are open or closed due to PIP2 interactions. Hence, mutations that decrease their apparent affinity of PIP2, resulting in “dwell times” necessarily shorter than 10 ms in KCNQ2-containing channels cannot possibly be meaningfully quantified during the decay of the current during the depolarization step to a very positive potential that activates Danio rerio VSP (Dr-VSP), because any shorter koff would be wholly confounded by the time required for PIP2 dephosphorylation. In such a case, only an altered rate of recovery of the current, reflecting an altered kon, could be meaningful. Thus, such relatively low PIP2 apparent affinity channels are unsuitable for this approach. For these reasons, we chose the KCNQ3 homomer as our test channel, due to its extremely high apparent affinity for PIP2, as manifested by its saturating open probability near unity at saturating voltages and its maximal depression by M1 receptor stimulation of only ∼40% (5Li Y.

Our assumption was that that this channel would be amenable to such analysis using the VSP approach and that high structural and mechanistic similarity with the other KCNQ subtypes should make our data generalizable among this K+ channel family. In some experiments, we used the alternative assay of quantifying the extent of depression of the current by stimulation of muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors (M1Rs) co-expressed with the channels (see below). In our patch-clamp experiments, we used the well-expressing KCNQ3-A315T (KCNQ3T) channel as a baseline, an inner-pore mutant that increases whole-cell current amplitudes by >10-fold (20Zaika O.

Falkenburger B. Shapiro M.S. Affinity for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate determines muscarinic agonist sensitivity of Kv7 K+ channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 134 (19858360): 437-44810.1085/jgp.200910313Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We probed the effects of charge neutralizations in the S2–S3 linker, the S4–S5 linker, the S6Jx domain, and the A–B helix linker on changes in the apparent PIP2 affinity of the channels as well as their voltage dependence of activation. In addition, homology modeling and PIP2-docking simulations were performed to seek a structural framework for our experimental results. We find that all of the regions tested are involved, complementing the PIP2-binding “cationic cluster” described previously in the A–B helix linker of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (8Hernandez C.C. Zaika O. Shapiro M.S. A carboxy-terminal inter-helix linker as the site of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate action on Kv7 (M-type) K+ channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 132 (18725531): 361-38110.1085/jgp.200810007Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whereas the four domains identified here for KCNQ3 as interacting with PIP2 are conserved with KCNQ1, and likely KCNQ2, mutations that lowered the apparent affinity of the channels for PIP2 were not correlated with alterations in voltage dependence. We chose Dr-VSP because it activates at +40 mV, well positive to the saturating voltage for all KCNQ channels. Upon activation of Dr-VSP by depolarization to +120 mV, which dephosphorylates PIP2 into PI(4)P, quantification of the rate of decay of the current provides an estimate of changes in koff of PIP2 from the channels due to mutations. We realize that this is an approximation, due to the confound of the known rate of Dr-VSP dephosphorylation of PIP2 by Dr-VSP at that voltage (τ ∼250 ms). However, the deconvolution of those rates is beyond the scope of this paper; moreover, we would need information on the allosteric influence of the binding of one PIP2 molecule to one subunit on its affinity with another and the precise number of PIP2 molecules required for the opening of KCNQ3 homomers, and both sets of data are lacking at this time. Upon the step back to +30 mV, changes in kon of PIP2 due to mutations were estimated by the rate of recovery of the current. We again realize that this estimate is an approximation due to the confound of the known rate of PI(4)P-5 kinase (τ ∼10 s) (14Falkenburger B.H. Jensen J.B. Hille B. Kinetics of PIP2 metabolism and KCNQ2/3 channel regulation studied with a voltage-sensitive phosphatase in living cells.J. Gen.

Again, an even more sophisticated deconvolution would be extremely difficult without more information, which is also not presently available. Besides the measurements described above, we also compared the amplitude of tonic whole-cell currents between cells transfected with KCNQ3T and mutant KCNQ3T channels and the voltage dependence of activation. The first measurement is based on the correlation between the tonic open probability at the single-channel level, macroscopic current amplitudes, and PIP2 apparent affinity observed for KCNQ2, KCNQ2/3, KCNQ3, and KCNQ4 channels (5Li Y.

We were therefore keen to investigate these issues for the case of KCNQ3, which is found primarily in neurons, as opposed to cardiomyocytes or epithelia.

Because these sites are most novel in terms of PIP2 interactions suggested for KCNQ2–5 channels, we begin here. For KCNQ1, the interactions with the S2–S3 linker involve Arg190 and Arg195, and for the S4–S5 linker, they involve Arg243, His258, and Arg259. The sequence alignment of the S2–S3 and the S4–S5 linkers among KCNQ1–5 channels (Fig. 1A and Fig. S3E) indicates the Arg190, Arg195, and His258 residues to be conserved. The perforated patch variant of whole-cell recording was performed to maintain the intracellular milieu and prevent “run-down” of PIP2 abundance. We tested the effect of charge-neutralizing mutations at the analogous positions, Arg190 and Arg195, in the S2–S3 linker and His257 (corresponding to His258 in KCNQ1) in the S4–S5 linker of KCNQ3T (Figs. 1 (A–C) and 2). In the S2–S3 linker, the R190Q mutation, but not R195Q, decreased current densities from 197 ± 6 to 66 ± 12 pA/pF (Fig. 2 (A and B) and Table 1). Using the Dr-VSP assay, we found the rate of current decay upon depolarization that turns on Dr-VSP (τdecay) for the R190Q mutant (0.35 ± 0.11 s) to be much faster than for KCNQ3T (0.94 ± 0.13 s) (Fig. 2 (D and E)); however, the rates of recovery of the current (τrecovery) were not significantly different (7.5 ± 1.7 s versus 9.6 ± 1.6 s for KCNQ3T and R190Q, respectively). The same result was obtained from the analogous mutant R190A (τdecay = 0.35 ± 2 s, τrecovery = 7.5 ± 1.8 s). Neither response was altered by the R195Q mutation. Either Arg190 influences Koff for PIP2, but not kon, or our assay is not sensitive enough to detect changes in both rates accurately. As an alternative assay, we thus turned to the classic M1R-dependent depression of the current in cells co-expressing M1 muscarinic receptors and KCNQ3T mutants. Because maximal M1R stimulation in tissue culture cells leads to about an 80% decrease in PIP2 abundance, rather than to near zero when VSPs are activated (14Falkenburger B.H. Jensen J.B. Hille B. Kinetics of PIP2 metabolism and KCNQ2/3 channel regulation studied with a voltage-sensitive phosphatase in living cells.J. Gen. Physiol. 2010; 135 (20100891): 99-11410.1085/jgp.200910345Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the maximal depression of KCNQ3 currents is only ∼30–40%, because enough PIP2 molecules remain in the membrane to keep most KCNQ3 channels PIP2-bound (19Hernandez C.C. Falkenburger B. Shapiro M.S. Affinity for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate determines muscarinic agonist sensitivity of Kv7 K+ channels.J. Gen.

Thus, for such high PIP2 apparent affinity channels, a change in that affinity is manifested most in the fractional suppression of the current, not a shift of the dose–response relation of [agonist] versus current suppression (Fig. S1F). In these experiments, we decided to use mutants in which the arginines at positions 190 and 195 were mutated to alanines instead of the highly hydrophilic and bulky glutamines, which can interact with PIP2 via several types of H+ bonds, to avoid any such confounding effects. Consistent with previous work, we found the KCNQ3T current to be suppressed by a supramaximal concentration (10 μm) of the receptor agonist, oxotremorine methiodide, by only 29.5 ± 5.5%, and for cells expressing KCNQ3T-R195A, the maximal inhibition was only 24.9 ± 5.8%. However, for KCNQ3T-R190A, the maximal inhibition was 63 ± 13%, indicating that the R190A mutation reduces PIP2 affinity, consistent with the Dr-VSP assay (Fig. 2G and Fig. S1). Neither the R190Q/A nor the R195Q/A mutations affected the voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the apparent affinity of PIP2 for this site is unrelated to voltage dependence.Table 1Effects of mutations on the properties and PIP2 apparent affinities of KCNQ3 channelsKCNQ3TStructural domainChannel functionRates from Dr-VSP assaysM1R inhibitionCurrent densityV½τ, decay at +120 mVτ, recovery at +30 mVpA/pFmVss%WT197 ± 6 (n = 19)−34.0 ± 1.9 (n = 19)0.94 ± 0.13 (n = 10)7.5 ± 1.7 (n = 11)29.5 ± 5.5 (n = 3)R190QS2–S3 linker66 ± 12*** (n = 6)−39.9 ± 1.9 (n = 5)0.35 ± 0.11** (n = 8)9.6 ± 1.6 (n = 8)63 ± 13 (n = 6)R195QS2–S3 linker195 ± 13 (n = 6)−36.0 ± 1.8 (n = 6)0.98 ± 0.22 (n = 5)7.4 ± 1.0 (n = 5)24.9 ± 5.8 (n = 7)R242AS4–S5 linker146 ± 16*** (n = 10)−4.0 ± 3.2*** (n = 7)0.77 ± 0.13 (n = 10)14.2 ± 1.7* (n = 10)64.8 ± 9.2 (n = 3)R243AS4–S5 linker56 ± 16*** (n = 4)−31 ± 4.7 (n = 4)0.59 ± 0.19* (n = 4)13.1 ± 1.8* (n = 4)42 ± 5.5 (n = 3)R242A/R243AS4–S5 linker65 ± 11*** (n = 11)−0.2 ± 2.9*** (n = 5)0.45 ± 0.11** (n = 5)15 ± 1.7* (n = 5)91.6 ± 2.7 (n = 4)H257NS4–S5 linker30 ± 3*** (n = 7)2.5 ± 2.8*** (n = 7)0.58 ± 0.14* (n = 4)11.03 ± 1.4 (n = 2)81.6 ± 7.9 (n = 4)K358AS6Jx195 ± 7 (n = 9)−28.8 ± 2.2 (n = 9)0.94 ± 0.25 (n = 6)8.0 ± 1.7 (n ="
https://openalex.org/W2896958358,"The vertebrate pineal gland is dedicated to the production of the hormone melatonin, which increases at night to influence circadian and seasonal rhythms. This increase is associated with dramatic changes in the pineal transcriptome. Here, single-cell analysis of the rat pineal transcriptome was approached by sequencing mRNA from ~17,000 individual pineal cells, with the goals of profiling the cells that comprise the pineal gland and examining the proposal that there are two distinct populations of pinealocytes differentiated by the expression of Asmt, which encodes the enzyme that converts N-acetylserotonin to melatonin. In addition, this analysis provides evidence of cell-specific time-of-day dependent changes in gene expression. Nine transcriptomically distinct cell types were identified: ~90% were classified as melatonin-producing α- and β-pinealocytes (1:19 ratio). Non-pinealocytes included three astrocyte subtypes, two microglia subtypes, vascular and leptomeningeal cells, and endothelial cells. α-Pinealocytes were distinguished from β-pinealocytes by ~3-fold higher levels of Asmt transcripts. In addition, α-pinealocytes have transcriptomic differences that likely enhance melatonin formation by increasing the availability of the Asmt cofactor S-adenosylmethionine, resulting from increased production of a precursor of S-adenosylmethionine, ATP. These transcriptomic differences include ~2-fold higher levels of the ATP-generating oxidative phosphorylation transcriptome and ~8-fold lower levels of the ribosome transcriptome, which is expected to reduce the consumption of ATP by protein synthesis. These findings suggest that α-pinealocytes have a specialized role in the pineal gland: efficiently O-methylating the N-acetylserotonin produced and released by β-pinealocytes, thereby improving the overall efficiency of melatonin synthesis. We have also identified transcriptomic changes that occur between night and day in seven cell types, the majority of which occur in β-pinealocytes and to a lesser degree in α-pinealocytes; many of these changes were mimicked by adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol. The cellular heterogeneity of the pineal gland as revealed by this study provides a new framework for understanding pineal cell biology at single-cell resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2895866812,"A sodium carboxy-methylcellulose (CMC)/chitosan (CS) composite sponge as drug carrier was prepared, and its structure and functions were investigated. Samples with different CMC/chitosan ratios and under different pH conditions were synthesized via a freeze-drying method. The microstructure of the dried sponges was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Molecule interactions between polymers were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and Thermal gravimetric analyze (TGA). The swelling degree, weight loss, in vitro drug release behavior and antibacterial property of the sponges were determined as well. The results showed that the CMC/chitosan ratio and the pH value significantly affected the appearance of the blending solution and the microstructure of the final product, and also affected the sponge’s degradation behavior, drug-loading capacity and the antibacterial activity. Gentamicin (GEN) as a hydrophilic model drug was remarkably superior to the other two hydrophobic drugs, ibuprofen (IBU) and roxithromycin (ROX), with respect to in vitro releasing. Moreover, higher CMC content and lower pH value of the sponge were confirmed to lead a larger loading for GEN. The bacteriostatic experiment showed a strong antimicrobial ability of GEN-loaded sponges on inhibiting Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W2896167348,"Therapeutic potential of bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) has been reported in several animal models of liver fibrosis. Interleukin (IL) 17A, IL6 and Stat3 have been described to play crucial roles in chronic liver injury. However, the modulatory effect of MSCs on these markers was controversial in different diseases. BM-MSCs might activate the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway and promote cell invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma, but the immunomodulatory role of BM-MSCs on IL17A/IL6/STAT3 was not fully elucidated in liver fibrosis. In the present study, we evaluated the capacity of the BM-MSCs in the modulation of cytokines milieu and signal transducers, based on unique inflammatory genes Il17a and Il17f and their receptors Il17rc and their effect on the IL6/STAT3 pathway in CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in rats. A single dose of BM-MSCs was administered to the group with induced liver fibrosis, and the genes and proteins of interest were evaluated along six weeks after treatment. Our results showed a significant downregulation of Il17a, Il17ra, il17f and Il17rc genes. In accordance, BM-MSCs administration declined IL17, IL2 and IL6 serum proteins and downregulated IL17A and IL17RA proteins in liver tissue. Interestingly, BM-MSCs downregulated both Stat3 mRNA expression and p-STAT3, while Stat5a gene was downregulated and p-STAT5 protein was elevated. Also P-SMAD3 and TGFβR2 proteins were downregulated in response to BM-MSCs treatment. Collectively, we suggest that BM-MSCs might play an immunomodulatory role in the treatment of liver fibrosis through downregulation of IL17A affecting IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2896930952,"Our understanding of genomic heterogeneity in lung cancer is largely based on the analysis of early-stage surgical specimens. Here we used endoscopic sampling of paired primary and intrathoracic metastatic tumors from 11 lung cancer patients to map genomic heterogeneity inoperable lung cancer with deep whole-genome sequencing. Intra-patient heterogeneity in driver or targetable mutations was predominantly in the form of copy number gain. Private mutation signatures, including patterns consistent with defects in homologous recombination, were highly variable both within and between patients. Irrespective of histotype, we observed a smaller than expected number of private mutations, suggesting that ancestral clones accumulated large mutation burdens immediately prior to metastasis. Single-region whole-genome sequencing of from 20 patients showed that tumors in ever-smokers with the strongest tobacco signatures were associated with germline variants in genes implicated in the repair of cigarette-induced DNA damage. Our results suggest that lung cancer precursors in ever-smokers accumulate large numbers of mutations prior to the formation of frank malignancy followed by rapid metastatic spread. In advanced lung cancer, germline variants in DNA repair genes may interact with the airway environment to influence the pattern of founder mutations, whereas similar interactions with the tumor microenvironment may play a role in the acquisition of mutations following metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2896076867,"Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) can be measured in the EEG as response to a visual stimulus. Commonly, VEPs are displayed by averaging multiple responses to a certain stimulus or a classifier is trained to identify the response to a certain stimulus. While the traditional approach is limited to a set of predefined stimulation patterns, we present a method that models the general process of VEP generation and thereby can be used to predict arbitrary visual stimulation patterns from EEG and predict how the brain responds to arbitrary stimulation patterns. We demonstrate how this method can be used to model single-flash VEPs, steady state VEPs (SSVEPs) or VEPs to complex stimulation patterns. It is further shown that this method can also be used for a high-speed BCI in an online scenario where it achieved an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 108.1 bit/min. Furthermore, in an offline analysis, we show the flexibility of the method allowing to modulate a virtually unlimited amount of targets with any desired trial duration resulting in a theoretically possible ITR of more than 470 bit/min."

Methods Retrospective study of 354 patients primarily treated with surgery between 2006 and 2016. Cases were selected according to completeness and accuracy of available clinical data. Thus, a selection bias cannot be excluded. Patients who received PBT were identified by our controlling department and verified by our blood bank data base. Results Both, preoperative anemia and PBT significantly decreased OS in univariate analysis. Although PBT was needed more frequently by older patients in worse physical conditions with more advanced HNSCC, subgroup analysis also demonstrate a profoundly negative effect of PBT on OS in younger patients and early stage HNSCC. According to a restrictive transfusion policy at our hospital the transfusion rate was comparably low. We could not verify increasing effects of PBT on cancer recurrence rates as it was previously shown. Discussion Preoperative anemia is the most common paraneoplastic syndrome in HNSCC. Despite its devastating prognostic effect we suggest a restrictive transfusion policy whenever possible. Our data also show that anemia as an independent prognostic factor in head and neck surgical oncology is defined not only by low hemoglobin concentrations but low red blood cell counts as well."

The aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms of ConA-mediated signaling and synthesis/release of mediators by HSCs that damage hepatocytes. Primary cultures of wildtype (WT) and IRF1-knockout (KO) HSCs and hepatocytes were used, and ConA-induced liver damage in interferon (IFN)αβ receptor-deficient (IFNαβR-KO) mice was determined. Specific binding of ConA to HSCs induced rapid activation of JAK2 and STAT1. ConA-induced expression of IRF1, IFNβ, tumor necrosis factor α, and CXCL1 was abrogated by selective inhibition of JAK2 and STAT1. Despite activating JAK2/STAT1, ConA failed to stimulate expression of inflammatory cytokines in HSCs from IRF1-KO mice. ConA-conditioned WT-HSC medium caused activation of JNK and caspase 3, and apoptosis of hepatocytes from WT but not from IRF1-KO or IFNαβR-KO mice. Conversely, ConA-conditioned medium of IRF1-KO HSCs failed to cause apoptosis of WT or IRF1-KO hepatocytes. IFNαβR-KO mice were protected from ConA-induced liver damage, and ConA-induced hepatic expression of IRF1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and infiltration of neutrophils were significantly lower in IFNαβR-KO than in WT mice.

https://openalex.org/W2895849857,"This study examines whether the relationship between the employees’ perceived job autonomy may be prone to the contextual influence of supervisor support and presenteeism climate in explaining the attendance behaviors of presenteeism–the employees’ decision to attend work despite being ill or not feeling well. Does work context play a role on presenteeism climate and the specific act of presenteeism? This study includes 213 health care employees (e.g., nurses, doctors) working in one private hospital in Lebanon. We used the ordinary least squared (OLS) regressions path analytical framework and bootstrapping methods to estimate the hypothesized moderated-mediation models. Our findings indicate that healthcare job resources (job autonomy) is correlated with the presenteeism climate and the occurrence of presenteeism attendance behaviors. We also found that this relationship is mediated by presenteeism climate and that supervisor support moderates the observed indirect relationship. This study extends the organizational attendance research domain to presenteeism climate by explaining for both doctors and nurses how contextual variables explains the relationship between jobs resources and presenteeism attendance behaviors. Supervisor support plays an important role in encouraging task autonomy and thus allowing employees increase their perception of empowerment to manage their actions at work. Overall, healthcare managers should ensure that employees understand their roles and duties and have an up-to-date, clearly defined role (e.g., job description) so that they can meet their organizations’ goals."
https://openalex.org/W2898051062,"The proliferative darkening syndrome (PDS) is an annually recurring disease that causes species-specific die-off of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) with a mortality rate of near 100% in pre-alpine rivers of central Europe. So far the etiology and causation of this disease is still unclear. The objective of this study was to identify the cause of PDS using a next-generation technology detection pipeline. Following the hypothesis that PDS is caused by an infectious agent, brown trout specimens were exposed to water from a heavily affected pre-alpine river with annual occurrence of the disease. Specimens were sampled over the entire time period from potential infection through death. Transcriptomic analysis (microarray) and RT-qPCR of brown trout liver tissue evidenced strong gene expression response of immune-associated genes. Messenger RNA of specimens with synchronous immune expression profiles were ultra-deep sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology (NGS). Bioinformatic processing of generated reads and gap-filling Sanger re-sequencing of the identified pathogen genome revealed strong evidence that a piscine-related reovirus is the causative organism of PDS. The identified pathogen is phylogenetically closely related to the family of piscine reoviruses (PRV) which are considered as the causation of different fish diseases in Atlantic and Pacific salmonid species such as Salmo salar and Onchorhynchus kisutch. This study also highlights that the approach of first screening immune responses along a timeline in order to identify synchronously affected stages in different specimens which subsequently were ultra-deep sequenced is an effective approach in pathogen detection. In particular, the identification of specimens with synchronous molecular immune response patterns combined with NGS sequencing and gap-filling re-sequencing resulted in the successful pathogen detection of PDS."

These services have expanded in health systems around the world. However, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of factors that may hinder the implementation of CPS in health systems. Objective To identify pharmacists’ and managers’ perceptions of barriers regarding the implementation of CPS in some public health units in a metropolis in Northeast Brazil. Methods This is a qualitative study based on focus groups and semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews. Participants were health-system pharmacists and managers, selected based on their direct participation in the implementation process. Focus groups were carried out with the pharmacists, and interviews were carried out with managers. The audio and videos were transcribed verbatim in full, and were independently analyzed using content analysis. This study was approved by the Brazilian Committee of Ethics in Research and all participants signed informed consent forms. Findings There were two focus groups and five interviews. The discussions generated 240 minutes of recordings. The health-system pharmacists and managers expressed barriers were allocated into five categories to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the implementation of CPS; these barriers were related to: the local healthcare networks, the healthcare team, the pharmacists, the implementation process, and the patients. Conclusions This study revealed the perceptions of barriers associated with the participants involved in the implementation of CPS in some public health units in a metropolis in Northeast Brazil. The barriers reflect the challenges to be overcome in the CPS implementation process in the health systems."

The aim of our study was to determine if serum and urine calprotectin are disease activity and prognosis biomarkers in ANCA vasculitis patients during remission. Methods Forty-two ANCA vasculitis patients were included. Twenty-seven patients were in remission phase under immunosuppressive therapy, and 15 patients were in the acute phase. Four healthy controls were included. We determined calprotectin in serum and urine samples at the time of the inclusion. We recorded the incidence of relapse and the evolution of GFR, proteinuria, hematuria, and C reactive protein and ANCA titer during 24 months of follow-up. Results In remission phase, serum calprotectin was higher than in healthy controls but lower compared to acute patients (p = 0.05). Serum calprotectin at inclusion was higher in patients who increased proteinuria during follow-up (p = 0.04), with hematuria (p = 0.08), and with non-decreasing ANCA titer (p = 0.0019). Serum calprotectin at inclusion in stable patients who subsequently decreased GFR during follow-up was higher compared with those with a stable or improving GFR (p = 0.03). Urine calprotectin was lower in patients with sclerotic histology in remission (p = 0.03) and acute phase (p = 0.12) compared to the rest of histologies. Conclusions Worsening of renal function, hematuria, rising proteinuria and non-decreasing ANCA correlated with higher levels of serum calprotectin at recruitment. Low urine calprotectin was found in patients with sclerotic histology. Calprotectin during remission in ANCA vasculitis may be useful to identify subclinical inflammation and worse renal prognosis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2897487144,"Background The obesity epidemic is spreading rapidly in Guatemala, a low/middle income country still struggling with undernutrition. Sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) consumption is strongly associated with overweight, obesity, and non-communicable diseases. In Guatemala, SSBs are readily available and consumption is high, particularly among adolescents. SSB taxes have been proposed as a cost-effective way to reduce consumption and generate revenues for public health, as has been demonstrated in several countries around the world. Objective To estimate the price, expenditure, quality, and cross-price elasticity of beverage demand using household survey data. Method We conducted a secondary analysis on the 2014 Guatemala Living Conditions National Survey that includes national representative household data on expenditure. Own price, expenditure, quality, and cross-price elasticities of milk, soft drinks, packaged juices, and bottled water were estimated using Deaton’s Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS), controlling for goods’ quality. Household characteristics and beverage expenditure are summarized for urban and rural locations using descriptive statistics. Results Positive expenditure on soft drinks was highest (50.9% of households). Positive expenditure on bottled water was next for urban households (43.8%) and lowest for rural households (10.8%). Own-price elasticities for all beverages are negative and statistically significant. Own-price elasticity of soft drinks is -1.39, suggesting that with a 10% increase in price, consumption would decrease by 13.9%. Expenditure elasticity for soft drinks (0.99) suggests that a 10% household expenditure increase would result in a 9.9% increase in demand. Milk (0.07) and soft drinks (0.07) have positive quality elasticity implying that, as household total expenditure increases, the quality of these beverages, measured by their unit values, also increases. Conclusion Soft drink demand is highly sensitive to changes in prices, suggesting that SSB taxes could significantly reduce consumption, which, in turn, could contribute to curbing the overweight/obesity epidemic."

Plants use the sequential activities of FAD2 and FAD3 desaturases to convert 18:1Δ9 to the important PUFA 18:3Δ9,12,15, whereas the fungus Fusarium verticillioides 7600 uses the bifunctional desaturase Fm1 for both reactions. Here, we used a combination of sequence comparisons, structural modeling, and mutagenesis experiments to investigate Fm1’s regioselectivity and identified two functionally relevant clusters of residues that contribute to Fm1 activity. We found that cluster I (Leu153, Phe157, and His194), located near the catalytic iron ions, predominantly affects activity, whereas cluster II (Tyr280, His284, and Leu287), located in a helix forming the entrance to the substrate-binding pocket, mainly specifies 15-desaturation. Individual or combined substitutions of cluster II residues substantially reduced 15-desaturation. The combination of F157W from cluster I with Y280L, H284V, and L287T from cluster II created an increased-activity variant that almost completely lost the ability to desaturate at C15 and acted almost exclusively as a 12-desaturase. No variants were identified in which 15-desaturation occurred in the absence of 12-desaturation. Fm1 displayed only traces of activity with C16 substrate, but several cluster I variants exhibited increased activity with both 18:1 and 16:1 substrates, converting 16:1Δ9 to 16:3Δ9,12,15, consistent with Fm1 performing sequential v + 3 desaturation reactions at C12 and then C15.

They are deemed as essential fatty acids because mammals lack the desaturases for producing them, and they must be obtained from dietary sources (8Lee J.M. Lee H. Kang S. Park W.J.

LA and ALA are also industrially important drying agents that are widely used in paints and varnishes (9Soucek M.D. Khattab T. Wu J. Review of autoxidation and driers.Prog. Org.

Further insertion of a double bond at Δ15(ω3)-position in LA gives rise to ALA. The main dietary source for obtaining VLC-PUFAs is marine fish. However, with increasing demand for fish oil, other sustainable sources of VLC-PUFAs are needed (10Racine R.A. Deckelbaum R.J.

FAD2 inserts a double bond three carbons toward the methyl end from an existing double bond, in most cases a Δ9 double bond; therefore, it is considered as a v + 3 desaturase (or a Δ12-desaturase in the case of 16:1Δ9 and 18:1Δ9), whereas FAD3 performs ω3-desaturation, which inserts a double bond three carbons from the methyl end, hence making it an ω3-desaturase. The membrane desaturases share highly similar overall structures and secondary structures comprising four transmembrane domains and a soluble catalytic domain; however, their functions can vary greatly. In particular, high regioselectivity is one of the most remarkable properties for fatty acid desaturases (22Shanklin J. Guy J.E. Mishra G. Lindqvist Y. Desaturases: emerging models for understanding functional diversification of diiron-containing enzymes.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19363032): 18559-1856310.1074/jbc.R900009200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is of great interest to determine how these enzymes discriminate their substrates and perform regiospecific oxidation to lay the groundwork for engineering enzymes with novel desired functions. Although FAD2 and FAD3 share the same overall structural motifs, they share only 40% sequence identity and 55% similarity at the amino acid level. Other membrane fatty acid desaturases from microbes have been reported to possess both Δ12- and Δ15(ω3)-desaturation activity; for instance, Damude et al. (2Damude H.G. Zhang H. Farrall L. Ripp K.G. Tomb J.F. Hollerbach D. Yadav N.S. Identification of bifunctional Δ12/ω3 fatty acid desaturases for improving the ratio of ω3 to ω6 fatty acids in microbes and plants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These bifunctional enzymes provide an opportunity to investigate the structural/sequence determinants for their substrate specificity. For example, Hoffmann et al. (23Hoffmann M. Hornung E. Busch S. Kassner N. Ternes P. Braus G.H. Feussner I. A small membrane-peripheral region close to the active center determines regioselectivity of membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases from Aspergillus nidulans.J. Biol.

However, the detailed structural factors or amino acid determinants for regioselectivity as well as the mechanism of regioselectivity remain unresolved. Here, we report the identification of two clusters of residues in Fm1. Cluster I residues are close to the diiron center and principally affect the rate of desaturation, whereas cluster II residues are located at the opening of the substrate-binding pocket and likely interact with the substrate headgroup, establishing the substrate specificity of the enzymes. Alteration as few as two amino acids in the sequence of Fm1 can efficiently block the desaturation at the 15-position while retaining the 12-desaturation capability of the enzyme. Using a mutant with higher overall activity enabled the C16 desaturation products to be evaluated. 16:3 derived from such reactions have double bonds at the 9-, 12-, and 15-positions, showing that Fm1 performs two sequential v + 3 desaturation reactions. The amino acid sequences for membrane-bound fatty acid desaturases and related enzymes share relatively low homology. This reflects their diversity with respect to selectivity toward headgroups, substrate chain lengths, regioselectivity, and functional outcome. Nonetheless, they all share a core conserved tripartite histidine motif that ligates the catalytic iron ions (13Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Desaturation and related modifications of fatty acids.Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49 (15012248): 611-64110.1146/annurev.arplant.49.1.611Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment reveals that the iron-coordinating histidine residues align well, whereas other portions of the sequences vary greatly (Fig. 1). The conserved sequence regions of membrane desaturases are likely related to the overall architecture of the desaturases, whereas the less-well conserved regions may contribute to their observed substrate specificities. We included 12- and 15(ω3)-desaturase sequences from Arabidopsis and Synechocystis together with Fm1 in the alignment to encompass the diversity of available sequences. These sequences can be divided into two groups: one with 12-desaturation activity, including AtFAD2, 6803_DesA, and AtFAD6, and the other with 15(ω3)-desaturation activity, containing AtFAD8, AtFAD7, AtFAD3, and 6803_DesB. Fm1 can be classified into both groups as it is capable of performing both 12- and 15(ω3)-desaturation with respect to its 18-carbon substrate; therefore, we reasoned that it could possess features in common with both groups, whereas the features that are not shared by the two groups could potentially confer Fm1 with bifunctionality. At any specific amino acid location, if the residue within one group is conserved but differs from that in the other group, the residue of Fm1 at this position was considered to be potentially functionally relevant. Our first round of analyses revealed 44 such positions (Fig. 2A). Specifically, the residues at Fm1 positions 36, 97, 110, 136, 139, 143, 156, 162, 165, 198, 199, 206, 207, 208, 228, 229, 235, 237, 238, 240, 248, 250, 273, 280, 284, 288, 290, 302, 304, 305, 327, 330, 335, 367, 380, 391, and 398 are common to 15(ω3)-desaturases (Fig. 2A, ➃), whereas positions 98, 99, 120, 298, 350, and 377 are conserved in 12-desaturases (Fig. 2A, ➁). Fm1 shares conservation with 15(ω3)-desaturases at positions 110, 162, 229, 235, 238, 240, 273, and 280 (Fig. 2A, ➂) and with 12-desaturases at positions 98, 99, and 318 (Fig. 2A, ➀), which could potentially contribute to determining desaturation selectivity. The above analyses reveal 44 sites that potentially contribute to the desaturation specificity/activity of Fm1. We therefore preformed site-directed mutagenesis to analyze each site’s potential contribution to enzyme activity. At each site, if one group was conserved but differed from that in Fm1, the site in Fm1 was mutated to the residue equivalent to that of the consensus group. Alternatively, if the consensus was shared with Fm1, then the site in Fm1 was mutated to the equivalent residue from the second group (i.e. FAD2 for the 12-desaturase group and FAD3 for the 15-desaturase group). Because some sites are closely located in sequence, we simplified our analysis by treating them as single sites. Although mutations of the sites that are conserved between FAD2 (12-desaturation) enzymes and Fm1 led to dramatically impaired Fm1 activity (Fig. 2B), mutations at sites that are only conserved in FAD2 enzymes did not result in substantial changes (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, mutations at sites that are conserved in both Fm1 and 15(ω3)-desaturation enzymes or FAD3 enzymes had broad effects on Fm1 specificity (Fig. 2, D and E). Notably, mutations at positions 280 and 284 resulted in an altered product profile: Fm1 mainly produces ALA with an ALA/LA ratio of ∼0.86 (as calculated by the observed ALA/(ALA + LA) because all the ALA resulted from a second desaturation of LA), whereas mutations at both sites preferentially produce LA, reducing the ratio of ALA/LA. Particularly, Y280L showed significant reduction of the accumulation of ALA with an ALA/LA ratio of ∼0.4, although overall enzyme activity was compromised. However, although H284N altered Fm1’s ratio of ALA/LA to 0.55, it resulted in an increase in overall activity by more than 30%. These results show that these residues can influence both activity and specificity, and their separation by only four amino acids suggests that they are likely located within the same secondary structural element. To investigate the possible spatial distribution of the sites described above, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of Fm1. The only membrane-bound fatty acid desaturase structures available to date are mammalian fatty acyl-CoA Δ9-desaturases (24Wang H. Klein M.G. Zou H. Lane W. Snell G. Levin I. Li K. Sang B.C. Crystal structure of human stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase in complex with substrate.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 (26098317): 581-58510.1038/nsmb.3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Bai Y. McCoy J.G. Levin E.J. Sobrado P. Rajashankar K.R. Fox B.G. Zhou M.

In contrast to 12- and 15(ω3)-desaturases, these enzymes introduce the first double bond into fatty acyl chain at the Δ9-position and share very little sequence homology with Fm1 (∼18% identity and 30% similarity). However, the residues comprising their active sites are conserved, particularly the histidine residues that coordinate the catalytically essential iron ions. We therefore used the mouse fatty acyl-CoA Δ9-desaturase (mSCD1) structure as the template to model Fm1 3D structure and mapped the residues potentially related to Fm1 specificity/activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, the overall Fm1 model adopts a mushroom-like shape with four transmembrane helices and a cytosolic portion that possesses the substrate-binding channel and active site. Like the mammalian fatty acyl-CoA Δ9-desaturases, the substrate-binding channel of Fm1 is boomerang-shaped and can accommodate a cis-oleoyl or a cis-linoleoyl chain (Fig. 3B). The spatial distribution of nine histidine residues that coordinate two iron ions is also strictly conserved. In primary sequence, these nine residues are dispersed in four clusters, including motifs 105HXXXH109, 141HXXHH145, and 337HXXHH341 and a separate His295. The two iron ions are located adjacent to the bend in the substrate-binding pocket where they can activate a molecular oxygen to create the high-valence iron–oxygen adduct necessary to abstract two pro-R hydrogens to form the cis-double bond. Interestingly, the model predicts that the two residues that affected the product profile of Fm1, i.e. 280 and 284, are in consecutive turns of the same helix (Fig. 3B). Moreover, this helix forms the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket, consistent with a potential role in substrate recognition and orientation. We hypothesized that the residues close to the iron ions could potentially fine-tune catalytic efficiency. We therefore analyzed residues within 5 Å of the iron ions in our model. Besides the conserved histidine residues, three residues appeared in our list, i.e. Phe157, Ile290, and Trp308 (Fig. 3B). Ile290 had already been investigated in the analysis of 15(ω3)-desaturase conserved sites in which mutation of Ile290 resulted in impaired Fm1 activity. Trp308 is strictly conserved in all the desaturases used for the alignment, and location 157 showed some diversity: for example, 6803_DesA, AtFAD6, and all the FAD3-like enzymes have a Trp at this position, whereas mSCD1 possesses an His. We tested the effects of the Phe157 mutations by substituting it with either Trp or His. Interestingly, both mutations significantly increase Fm1 activity (Fig. 4A). Specifically, substitution of His for Phe at position 157 increased Fm1 activity by ∼150%, and F157W increased activity by 65%. Moreover, F157W altered Fm1’s product profile, producing ALA/LA at a ratio of 0.56, confirming that residues close to the catalytic iron ions can play an important role in both activity and specificity. The residues in the helix that forms the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket seem to be critical for determining the product profile of Fm1 as revealed by Y280L and H284N/V. These two residues face the same direction of the helix. We hypothesized that other residues in the same helix facing the same direction could also affect the enzyme specificity in a similar way. We tested the effects of mutagenesis of Leu287, which is one turn away from His284. It is relatively conserved among all the desaturases in the alignment except for 6803_DesA and AtFAD6 in which Leu is replaced by another hydrophobic residue, Met. However, in the model template, mSCD1 possesses a Thr at this position. Therefore, we chose to test the effects of mutations at position 287 to Thr. As shown in Fig. 4A, L287T indeed enables Fm1 to produce fewer ALA relative to native Fm1, further confirming the importance of the residues in the same helix. F. verticillioides 7600 has two bifunctional 12/ω3-desaturases, i.e. Fm1 and Fm2. Fm1 preferentially produces more ω3 products, whereas Fm2 is mainly an LA producer. We added Fm2 to the sequence alignment (Fig. S1) and compared the sequences of these two enzymes to identify residues that could discriminate their product specificity. We focused on sites where neither Fm1 and Fm2 nor Δ12 and ω3 groups share identity. This led to 14 candidates at locations 25, 67, 121, 153, 164, 190, 194, 207, 210, 240, 264, 271, 345, and 396. These sites in Fm1 were mutated to corresponding residues in Fm2 to investigate their potential effects on specificity and activity. Interestingly, two mutations, L153R and H194Q, increased the overall activity of Fm1 by 106 and 90%, respectively (Fig. 4B). In addition, H194Q shifted the Fm1 product profile to the preferential production of LA with an ALA/LA ratio of ∼0.5. When we mapped these two sites in the Fm1 model, we found that, like Phe157, Leu153 is very close to the catalytic iron ions. Therefore, it might also participate in fine-tuning active-site geometry, thereby increasing Fm1 activity. His194 is in a small helix adjacent to Phe157, which is very close to the upper edge of the substrate-binding pocket, suggesting that it might influence the orientation of the secondary structural elements, thereby affecting Fm1 activity. The above analyses reveal a series of residues that affect Fm1 overall activity and product specificity: mutations K36R, L153R, and F157H increase the activity of Fm1 by more than 25%; Y280L, H284V, and L287T reverse the product specificity (i.e. from preferential production of ALA to LA); and F157W, H194Q, and H284N have effects on both activity and specificity. It is noteworthy that the increased-activity mutants are not the result of increased accumulation of the enzymes because the mutants’ expression levels are similar to those of the native enzyme (Fig. S2). We next combined beneficial mutations to test whether their effects would be additive. As shown in Fig. 5, most of the activity-increasing mutations showed some additive effects. For example, K36R/L153R/F157H increased Fm1 activity by almost 3-fold with the majority of the products being ALA, consistent with each of them individually contributing to Fm1 activity. The Y280L/H284V/L287T mutant produces exclusively LA but with greatly compromised enzyme activity. Further stacking F157H or F157W in combination with Y280L/H284V/L287T partially restored Fm1 activity without altering the product profile. In contrast, F157W/Y280L/L287T produced ALA/LA at a ratio of ∼0.06, i.e. only about 115 that of Fm1, whereas its overall activity increased 80%. H194Q seems to have different effects in combination with other mutations. F157W/H194Q displayed a slight increase in overall activity relative to H194Q; however, the combination of these two sites did not result in a further decrease in the ALA/LA ratio. Interestingly, L153R/F157H/H194Q has impaired overall activity relative to L153R/F157H, suggesting that H194Q and F157H either have overlapping effects on enzyme activity or function negatively when present in combination. Although we were able to identify many mutants with altered activity or specificity with respect to 15-desaturation, no mutants were identified that could desaturate at the 15- but not the 12-position. Fm1 can insert a double bond at the 15(ω3)-position in LA to produce ALA. Two possible mechanisms could account for this activity. In the first scenario, the enzyme could perform an ω3-desaturation, counting three carbons from the methyl end of linoleic acid in a manner like that of FAD3. A second possibility could be that Fm1 performs a desaturation by counting three carbons from the existing Δ12 double bond (v + 3 desaturation). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined the products of Fm1 with respect to 16-carbon substrate. Fm1 produces 16:2 and 16:3 from 16:1Δ9 but with much lower activity relative to that with 18:1Δ9 (Fig. 6B), which precluded reliable double bond positional analysis. We therefore took advantage of the enhanced-activity mutant Fm1-K36R/L153R/F157H (abbreviated as Fm1-3 hereafter), which is more active but shows the same product profile as native Fm1 (Fig. 6, A and B). When we fed the Fm1-3-expressing strain with palmitoleic acid, the production of both 16:2 and 16:3 was enhanced (Fig. 6, D and F). Double bond positional analysis from pyrrolidide derivatives identified the desaturation products as 16:2Δ9,12 and 16:3Δ9,12,15, respectively (Fig. S4). These results indicated that Fm1 processively desaturates its 16:1Δ9 substrate to 16:2Δ9,12 and 16:3Δ9,12,15 via two sequential v + 3 desaturation reactions. Direct structure–function analysi"

While there have been a number of attempts to develop a vaccine for Ft, few candidates have advanced beyond experiments in inbred mice. We report here that a prime-boost strategy with aerosol delivery of recombinant live attenuated candidate Ft S4ΔaroD offers significant protection (83% survival) in an outbred animal model, New Zealand White rabbits, against aerosol challenge with 248 cfu (11 LD50) of virulent type A Ft SCHU S4. Surviving rabbits given two doses of the attenuated strains by aerosol did not exhibit substantial post-challenge fevers, changes in erythrocyte sedimentation rate or in complete blood counts. At a higher challenge dose (3,186 cfu; 139 LD50), protection was still good with 66% of S4ΔaroD-vaccinated rabbits surviving while 50% of S4ΔguaBA vaccinated rabbits also survived challenge. Pre-challenge plasma IgG titers against Ft SCHU S4 corresponded with survival time after challenge. Western blot analysis found that plasma antibody shifted from predominantly targeting Ft O-antigen after the prime vaccination to other antigens after the boost. These results demonstrate the superior protection conferred by a live attenuated derivative of virulent F. tularensis, particularly when given in an aerosol prime-boost regimen."
https://openalex.org/W2896704490,"We describe and test an obstacle-detection system for small, lake-deployed autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) that relies on a low-cost, consumer-grade camera and runs on a single-board computer. A key feature of lakes that must be accounted for is the frequent presence of the shoreline in images as well as the land-sky boundary. These particularities, along with variable weather conditions, result in a wide range of scene variations, including the possible presence of glint. The implemented algorithm is based on two main steps. First, possible obstacles are detected using an innovative gradient-based image processing algorithm developed especially for a camera with a low viewing angle to the water (i.e., the situation for a small ASV). Then, true and false positives are differentiated using correlation-based multi-frame analysis. The algorithm was tested extensively on a small ASV deployed in Lake Geneva. Under operational conditions, the algorithm processed 640×480-pixel images from a Raspberry Pi Camera at about 3—4 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B computer. The present algorithm demonstrates that single-board computers can be used for effective and low-cost obstacle detection systems for ASVs operating in variable lake conditions."

Data and methods The study uses data from the VII Encuesta de Presupuestos Familiares (Family Budget Survey) 2011–2012 conducted by the National Institute of Statistics. Because of problems with the quality of the measurement units, hot-deck imputation method was used with the alcohol purchases that presented problems. To estimate the demand elasticities, the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) method proposed by Deaton was used. Quality decisions were estimated for each beverage separately using an equation proposed by Deaton in the three-step AIDS. Results The estimated elasticities were more inelastic for spirits (-0.14, P<0.01), followed by wines (-0.77, P<0.01) and beers (-0.93, P<0.01). Spirits reported less sensitivity to changes in the total budget, while wines reported the most sensitivity to changes in the total budget (expenditure elasticity). Wines also reported the most sensitivity related to quality for changes in the total budget (0,20, meaning that a 10% increase in a household’s total expenditure increases the “quality” of purchased wines by 2%). Conclusions Own-price elasticities reported for spirits, wines and beers are consistently negative, and inelastic, in line with international evidence. Although own-price elasticities for spirits is more inelastic than found in most studies, its quality-elasticity is more positive and greater. This could be explained by the greater price dispersion of spirits, as well as spirits (and wine) being consumed more than beers in Chile. This in turn may be because consumers have the option of switching to cheaper, Chilean-produced spirits such as pisco and wines when prices rise. The existence of these relatively broad quality-elasticities points to the need for a change in the alcohol tax structure from the current ad-valorem tax to a specific tax that could reduce price dispersion and curb total consumption."

Accordingly, the progress in family planning has varied over the time across the countries.This study investigates long-term trajectories of demand for family planning and contraceptive prevalence rates and tests the hypothesis of convergence across the world countries.This study used data from United Nations Population Prospects for 185 countries and regions during 1970-2015. Standard graphical, parametric and nonparametric convergence metrics have been used for testing of the convergence hypothesis.The results suggest a substantial increase in the global average of both demand and actual prevalence of contraceptive practice across the countries, but the actual contraceptive use is yet to catch up with the demand. Our findings suggest that there is a convergence in contraceptive use across the countries, particularly since the mid-1990s.A major part of the convergence in demand for family planning and contraceptive prevalence rate is due to its stalling in both developed and many developing countries and its increase in several developing and least developed countries. Family planning has a greater role in human wellbeing particularly enhancing reproductive, maternal and child health outcomes than being a mere tool for fertility reduction. Therefore, the emphasis is needed on family planning efforts in the lagged behind countries for global convergence of family planning."
https://openalex.org/W2896453582,"Despite downward trends, driving under the influence (DUI) remains one of the most salient traffic safety problems. It is crucial to identify the processes behind a problem behaviour to target the most effective measures to address it. One way of exploring precursors of behaviour is measuring attitudes. All persons hold two types of attitudes, explicit and implicit. Although only one of these (explicit) lays the groundwork for current understandings of DUI, it is imperative to explore both types of attitudes. We explore the relationship between explicit and implicit attitudes towards DUI for the first time in the field. Explicit attitudes (what we say we mean) are measured by a questionnaire. Implicit attitudes (which are introspectively unidentified or inaccurately identified traces of past experience) are measured by the Go/No-go Association Task (GNAT) in a sample of young male drivers (n = 101). The results show a relationship between the two types of attitudes, but not completely in the expected way. Depending whether the amount of alcohol is over or under the legal limit, the relationship between explicit and implicit attitudes varies. We discuss the findings and provide directions for future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2896523897,"Humans build models of their environments and act according to what they have learnt. In simple experimental environments, such model-based behaviour is often well accounted for as if subjects are ideal Bayesian observers. However, more complex probabilistic tasks require more sophisticated forms of inference that are sufficiently computationally and statistically taxing as to demand approximation. Here, we study properties of two approximation schemes in the context of a serial reaction time task in which stimuli were generated from a hierarchical Markov chain. One, pre-existing, scheme was a generically powerful variational method for hierarchical inference which has recently become popular as an account of psychological and neural data across a wide swathe of probabilistic tasks. A second, novel, scheme was more specifically tailored to the task at hand. We show that the latter model fit significantly better than the former. This suggests that our subjects were sensitive to many of the particular constraints of a complex behavioural task. Further, the tailored model provided a different perspective on the effects of cholinergic manipulations in the task. Neither model fit the behaviour on more complex contingencies that competently. These results illustrate the benefits and challenges that come with the general and special purpose modelling approaches and raise important questions of how they can advance our current understanding of learning mechanisms in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2897811039,"An unusual novel plant virus provisionally named goji berry chlorosis virus (GBCV) was isolated from goji berry plants (Lycium chinense Miller) showing chlorosis symptoms and its complete genome sequence was determined. The viral genome consists of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA of 10,100 ribonucleotides and contains six open reading frames (ORFs). Electron microscopy showed that the viral genome is packaged as a filamentous particle with an average length of approximately 850 nm. Phylogenetic analysis and amino acid similarity analysis of the encoded ORFs revealed that this new virus could be classified in an intermediate position between the families Benyviridae and Virgaviridae. The GBCV 200-kDa replicase (ORF1) is more similar to benyvirus replicases than to virgavirus replicases, while its 17-kDa coat protein (CP, ORF2) is more closely related with virgavirus CPs than benyvirus CPs. ORF3 was predicted to produce a C-terminally extended protein from ORF2 via frameshifting. While ORF4 (45-kDa), ORF5 (44-kDa), and ORF6 (16-kDa) have no apparent sequence homology with other known viruses, ORF5 is predicted to encode a movement protein (MP) that is phylogenetically related to the furovirus MP and ORF6 was experimentally proven to encode a viral suppressor of RNA silencing. These unusual characteristics suggest that GBCV may represent an evolutionary link between the families Benyviridae and Virgaviridae and indicate the existence of a novel, unidentified virus group."
https://openalex.org/W2897930054,"Recent studies have indicated that birth weight to placental weight (BW/PW) ratio is related to perinatal outcomes, but the effect of congenital abnormalities on BW/PW ratio remains unclear. We performed this study to elucidate correlations between BW/PW ratio and congenital abnormalities. Subjects were 735 singleton infants born at 34-41 weeks of gestation admitted to our center between 2010 and 2016. Of these, 109 infants (15%) showed major congenital anomalies. Major congenital anomalies and subgroups were diagnosed according to European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies criteria. The primary outcome was the association between BW/PW ratio and major congenital anomaly, and secondary outcomes were the distribution pattern of BW/PW ratio with major anomalies and by major anomaly subgroups in each categorization (<10th percentile, 10-90th percentile, or >90th percentile) of BW/PW ratio. BW/PW ratio was not associated (P = 0.20) with presence (adjusted mean BWPW ratio = 5.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.87-5.18) or absence (adjusted mean BW/PW ratio = 4.91, 95%CI 4.85-4.97) of major anomalies, after adjusting for gestational age and sex. Proportions of infants with major anomalies according to BW/PW ratio categories were as follows: 12% in <10th percentile, 15% in 10-90th percentile, and 25% in >90th percentile of BW/PW ratio. Among major anomalies of the nervous system, congenital heart defects, and orofacial clefts, BW/PW ratio showed equally distributed trend across the three BW/PW ratio categories, but showed unequally distributed trend for anomalies of the digestive system, other anomalies/syndromes, or chromosomal abnormalities. BW/PW ratio was not associated with major congenital anomaly, and was distributed diffusely according to major anomaly subgroups. Major anomalies may tend to aggregate in the 90th percentile of the BW/PW ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2895869478,"Small Heat-Shock Proteins (sHSPs) and other proteins bearing alpha-crystallin domains (ACD) participate in defense against heat and oxidative stress and play important roles in cell cycle, cytoskeleton dynamics, and immunological and pathological mechanisms in eukaryotes. However, little is known about these proteins in early-diverging lineages of protists such as the kinetoplastids. Here, ACD-like proteins (ACDp) were investigated in genomes of 61 species of 12 kinetoplastid genera, including Trypanosoma spp. (23 species of mammals, reptiles and frogs), Leishmania spp. (mammals and lizards), trypanosomatids of insects, Phytomonas spp. of plants, and bodonids. Comparison of ACDps based on domain architecture, predicted tertiary structure, phylogeny and genome organization reveals a kinetoplastid evolutionarily conserved repertoire, which diversified prior to trypanosomatid adaptation to parasitic life. We identified 9 ACDp orthologs classified in 8 families of TryACD: four previously recognized (HSP20, Tryp23A, Tryp23B and ATOM69), and four characterized for the first time in kinetoplastids (TryACDP, TrySGT1, TryDYX1C1 and TryNudC). A single copy of each ortholog was identified in each genome alongside TryNudC1/TrypNudC2 homologs and, overall, ACDPs were under strong selection pressures at main phylogenetic lineages. Transcripts of all ACDPs were identified across the life stages of T. cruzi, T. brucei and Leishmania spp., but proteomic profiles suggested that most ACDPs may be species- and stage-regulated. Our findings establish the basis for functional studies, and provided evolutionary and structural support for an underestimated repertoire of ACDps in the kinetoplastids."
https://openalex.org/W2896625048,"Nowadays traditional training methods for promotion of oral health behaviors cannot meet the demand of the society and there is a need for effective new methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of social marketing approach versus the traditional method on promotion of tooth brushing habits in primary school students of Kahak and Jafariyeh, Qom, Iran.This study was conducted in the 2016-2017 academic year. First, the reasons for lack of interest in proper tooth brushing were evaluated. Forgetting and laziness were determined as the most important reasons. According to these results, appropriate intervention tools related to proper tooth brushing habits were designed. Then, the students' tooth brushing habits were recorded before the intervention. Students in Kahak that were considered non-randomly as intervention group received the designed educational package according to the social marketing approach for one and a half months. In Jafariyeh (control group), the students received training only through pamphlets as traditional method. After the intervention, the tooth brushing habits of the students were recorded. The habits before and after the intervention were compared using statistical tests.Increased length of tooth brushing to at least two minutes was 28.0% in Kahak and 14.0% in Jafariyeh (P<0.001) and increased frequency of tooth brushing to at least two times per day was 30.5% in Kahak and 11.8% in Jafariyeh (P<0.001). Improvement in tooth brushing habits (at least two minutes twice daily) was 32.9% in Kahak and 13.0% in Jafariyeh (P<0.001).The use of the social marketing approach is more effective than traditional methods in promoting oral health behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2896929156,"There is a large body of evidence showing substantial sensorimotor reorganizations after an amputation. These reorganizations are believed to contribute to the development of phantom limb pain, but alternatively, pain might influence the plasticity triggered by the deafferentation. The aim of this study was to test whether pain impacts on deafferentation-induced plasticity in the somatosensory pathways. Fifteen healthy subjects participated in 2 experimental sessions (Pain, No Pain) in which somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) associated with electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve were assessed before and after temporary ischemic deafferentation induced by inflation of a cuff around the wrist. In the Pain session capsaicin cream was applied on the dorsum of the hand 30 minutes prior to cuff inflation. Results show that pain decreased the amplitude of the N20 (main effect of condition, p = 0.033), with a similar trend for the P25. Temporary ischemic deafferentation had a significant effect on SSEPs (main effect of time), with an increase in the P25 (p = 0.013) and the P45 amplitude (p = 0.005), together with a reduction of the P90 amplitude (p = 0.002). Finally, a significant time x condition interaction, reflecting state-dependent plasticity, was found for the P90 only, the presence of pain decreasing the reduction of amplitude observed in response to deafferentation. In conclusion, these results show that nociceptive input can influence the plasticity induced by a deafferentation, which could be a contributing factor in the cortical somatosensory reorganization observed in chronic pain populations."
https://openalex.org/W2895908361,"Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis is the most common form of systemic amyloidosis. However, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms that initiate and modulate the associated protein aggregation and deposition. Model systems have been established to investigate these disease-associated processes. One of these systems comprises two 114 amino acid light-chain variable domains of the kappa 4 IgG family, SMA and LEN. Despite high sequence identity (93%), SMA is amyloidogenic in vivo, but LEN adopts a stable dimer, displaying amyloidogenic properties only under destabilising conditions in vitro. We present here a refined and reproducible periplasmic expression and purification protocol for SMA and LEN that improves on existing methods and provides high yields of pure protein (10-50mg/L), particularly suitable for structural studies that demand highly concentrated and purified proteins. We confirm that recombinant SMA and LEN proteins have structure and dimerization capabilities consistent with the native proteins and employ fluorescence to probe internalization and cellular localization within cardiomyocytes. We propose periplasmic expression and simplified chromatographic steps outlined here as an optimized method for production of these and other variable light chain domains to investigate the underlying mechanisms of light chain amyloidosis. We show that SMA and LEN can be internalised within cardiomyocytes and were observed to localise to the perinuclear area, assessed by confocal microscopy as a possible mechanism for underlying cytotoxicity and pathogenesis associated with amyloidosis."
