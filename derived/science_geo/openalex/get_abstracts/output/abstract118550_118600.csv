https://openalex.org/W2038514344,"Substantial functional reorganization takes place in the motor cortex of adult primates after a focal ischemic infarct, as might occur in stroke. A subtotal lesion confined to a small portion of the representation of one hand was previously shown to result in a further loss of hand territory in the adjacent, undamaged cortex of adult squirrel monkeys. In the present study, retraining of skilled hand use after similar infarcts resulted in prevention of the loss of hand territory adjacent to the infarct. In some instances, the hand representations expanded into regions formerly occupied by representations of the elbow and shoulder. Functional reorganization in the undamaged motor cortex was accompanied by behavioral recovery of skilled hand function. These results suggest that, after local damage to the motor cortex, rehabilitative training can shape subsequent reorganization in the adjacent intact cortex, and that the undamaged motor cortex may play an important role in motor recovery."

https://openalex.org/W2005026678,"A second gene for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease was identified by positional cloning. Nonsense mutations in this gene (PKD2) segregated with the disease in three PKD2 families. The predicted 968-amino acid sequence of the PKD2 gene product has six transmembrane spans with intracellular amino- and carboxyl-termini. The PKD2 protein has amino acid similarity with PKD1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of PKD1, and the family of voltage-activated calcium (and sodium) channels, and it contains a potential calcium-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2044199827,"During neuromuscular synapse formation, motor axons induce clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the muscle fiber membrane. The protein agrin, originally isolated from the basal lamina of the synaptic cleft, is synthesized and secreted by motoneurons and triggers formation of AChR clusters on cultured myotubes. We show here that postsynaptic AChR aggregates are markedly reduced in number, size, and density in muscles of agrin-deficient mutant mice. These results support the hypothesis that agrin is a critical organizer of postsynaptic differentiation. However, some postsynaptic differentiation does occur in the mutant, suggesting the existence of a second nerve-derived synaptic organizing signal. In addition, we show that intramuscular nerve branching and presynaptic differentiation are abnormal in the mutant, phenotypes which may reflect either a distinct effect of agrin or impaired retrograde signaling from a defective postsynaptic apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2142638534,"CHOP, a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, mediates effects of cellular stress on growth and differentiation. It accumulates under conditions of stress and undergoes inducible phosphorylation on two adjacent serine residues (78 and 81). In vitro, CHOP is phosphorylated on these residues by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase). A specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB203580, abolished the stress-inducible in vivo phosphorylation of CHOP. Phosphorylation of CHOP on these residues enhanced its ability to function as a transcriptional activator and was also required for the full inhibitory effect of CHOP on adipose cell differentiation. CHOP thus serves as a link between a specific stress-activated protein kinase, p38, and cellular growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2148646540,"Formation of neuromuscular synapses requires a series of inductive interactions between growing motor axons and differentiating muscle cells, culminating in the precise juxtaposition of a highly specialized nerve terminal with a complex molecular structure on the postsynaptic muscle surface. The receptors and signaling pathways mediating these inductive interactions are not known. We have generated mice with a targeted disruption of the gene encoding MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase selectively localized to the postsynaptic muscle surface. Neuromuscular synapses do not form in these mice, suggesting a failure in the induction of synapse formation. Together with the results of an accompanying manuscript, our findings indicate that MuSK responds to a critical nerve-derived signal (agrin), and in turn activates signaling cascades responsible for all aspects of synapse formation, including organization of the postsynaptic membrane, synapse-specific transcription, and presynaptic differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2098470595,"Members of the E2F transcription factor family (E2F-1–E2F-5) are believed to be critical positive regulators of cell cycle progression in eukaryotes although the in vivo functions of the individual E2Fs have not been elucidated. Mice were generated that lack E2F-1 and, surprisingly, these mice develop and reproduce normally. However, E2F-1−/− mice exhibit a defect in T lymphocyte development leading to an excess of mature T cells due to a maturation stage-specific defect in thymocyte apoptosis. As E2F-1−/− mice age they exhibit a second phenotype marked by aberrant cell proliferation. These findings suggest that while certain members of the E2F family may positively regulate cell cycle progression, E2F-1 functions to regulate apoptosis and to suppress cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2093417867,"Components of the signaling pathways that lie downstream of Ser/Thr kinase receptors and are required for signaling by the TGF beta superfamily have been poorly defined. The Drosophila gene Mothers against dpp (MAD) and the C. elegans sma genes are implicated in these signaling pathways. We show that MAD functions downstream of DPP receptors and is required for receptor signaling. Phosphorylation of MADR1, a human homolog of MAD, is tightly regulated and rapidly induced by BMP2, but not TGF beta or activin. This phosphorylation is necessary for function, since a point mutant that yields a null phenotype in Drosophila is not phosphorylated. BMP2 treatment results in accumulation of MADR1 in the nucleus. MAD proteins may thus define a novel class of signaling molecules with nuclear function in Ser/Thr kinase receptor signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1980759602,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) is a transcriptional repressor that regulates gene expression by physically associating with transcription factors such as E2F family members. Although pRB and its upstream regulators are commonly mutated in human cancer, the physiological role of the pRB–E2F pathway is unknown. To address the function of E2F-1 and pRB/E2F-1 complexes in vivo, we have produced mice homozygous for a nonfunctional E2F-1 allele. Mice lacking E2F-1 are viable and fertile, yet experience testicular atrophy and exocrine gland dysplasia. Surprisingly, mice lacking E2F-1 develop a broad and unusual spectrum of tumors. Although overexpression of E2F-1 in tissue culture cells can stimulate cell proliferation and be oncogenic, loss of E2F-1 in mice results in tumorigenesis, demonstrating that E2F-1 also functions as a tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2086874557,"Formation of th neuromuscular junction depends upon reciprocal inductive interactions between the developing nerve and muscle, resulting in the precise juxtaposition of a differentiated nerve terminal with a highly specialized patch on the muscle membrane, termed the motor endplate. Agrin is a nerve-derived factor that can induced molecular reorganizations at the motor endplate, but the mechanism of action of agrin remains poorly understood. MuSK is a receptor tyrosine kinase localized to the motor endplate, seemingly well positioned to receive a key nerve-derived signal. Mice lacking either agrin or MuSK have recently been generated and exhibit similarly profound defects in their neuromuscular junctions. Here we demonstrate that agrin acts via a receptor complex that includes MuSK as well as a myotube-specific accessory component."

https://openalex.org/W2022446120,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple the cellular metabolic state to electrical activity and are a critical link between blood glucose concentration and pancreatic insulin secretion. A mutation in the second nucleotide-binding fold (NBF2) of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) of an individual diagnosed with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy generated KATP channels that could be opened by diazoxide but not in response to metabolic inhibition. The hamster SUR, containing the analogous mutation, had normal ATP sensitivity, but unlike wild-type channels, inhibition by ATP was not antagonized by adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Additional mutations in NBF2 resulted in the same phenotype, whereas an equivalent mutation in NBF1 showed normal sensitivity to MgADP. Thus, by binding to SUR NBF2 and antagonizing ATP inhibition of KATP++ channels, intracellular MgADP may regulate insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2070428103,"SHP is an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that contains the dimerization and ligand-binding domain found in other family members but lacks the conserved DNA binding domain. In the yeast two-hybrid system, SHP interacted with several conventional and orphan members of the receptor superfamily, including retinoid receptors, the thyroid hormone receptor, and the orphan receptor MB67. SHP also interacted directly with these receptors in vitro. In mammalian cells, SHP specifically inhibited transactivation by the superfamily members with which it interacted. These results suggest that SHP functions as a negative regulator of receptor-dependent signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2118345984,"Peridinin-chlorophyll-protein, a water-soluble light-harvesting complex that has a blue-green absorbing carotenoid as its main pigment, is present in most photosynthetic dinoflagellates. Its high-resolution (2.0 angstrom) x-ray structure reveals a noncrystallographic trimer in which each polypeptide contains an unusual jellyroll fold of the alpha-helical amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains. These domains constitute a scaffold with pseudo-twofold symmetry surrounding a hydrophobic cavity filled by two lipid, eight peridinin, and two chlorophyll a molecules. The structural basis for efficient excitonic energy transfer from peridinin to chlorophyll is found in the clustering of peridinins around the chlorophylls at van der Waals distances."
https://openalex.org/W2016899885,"The human beta T cell receptor (TCR) locus, comprising a complex family of genes, has been sequenced. The locus contains two types of coding elements--TCR elements (65 variable gene segments and two clusters of diversity, joining, and constant segments) and eight trypsinogen genes --that constitute 4.6 percent of the DNA. Genome-wide interspersed repeats and locus-specific repeats span 30 and 47 percent, respectively, of the 685-kilobase sequence. A comparison of the germline variable elements with their approximately 300 complementary DNA counterparts reveals marked differential patterns of variable gene expression, the importance of exonuclease activity in generating TCR diversity, and the predominant tendency for only functional variable elements to be present in complementary DNA libraries."
https://openalex.org/W2080546144,"Xenopus cDNAs homologous to the Drosophila Mad gene and C. elegans CEM genes have been cloned and functionally analyzed by microinjection into frog embryos. The results show that these genes (Xmad) encode intracellular proteins that act downstream of TGFβ superfamily ligands. Most interesting is the fact that different Xmad proteins produce distinct biological responses. Xmad1 produces ventral mesoderm, apparently transducing a signal for BMP2 and BMP4, whereas Xmad2 induces dorsal mesoderm like Vg1, activin, and nodal. These results suggest that an individual Xmad protein waits poised in the cytoplasm for instruction from a distinct subset of TGFβ ligands and then conveys specific information to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2069493740,"The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of a covalently linked pair of calcium-binding (cb) epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains from human fibrillin-1, the protein defective in the Marfan syndrome, is described. The two domains are in a rigid, rod-like arrangement, stabilized by interdomain calcium binding and hydrophobic interactions. We propose a model for the arrangement of fibrillin monomers in microfibrils that reconciles structural and antibody binding data, and we describe a set of disease-causing mutations that provide the first clues to the specificity of cbEFG interactions. The residues involved in stabilizing the domain linkage are highly conserved in fibrillin, fibulin, thrombomodulin, and the low density lipoprotein receptor. We propose that the relative orientation of tandem cbEGF domains in these proteins is similar, but that in others, including Notch, pairs adopt a completely different conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2123775894,"The plant cell vacuole has multiple functions, including storage of proteins and maintenance of an acidic pH where proteases will have maximal activity. It has been assumed that these diverse functions occur in the same compartment. Here, we demonstrate that antibodies to two different tonoplast intrinsic proteins, alpha-TIP and TIP-Ma27, label vacuole membranes of two different compartments within the same cell. These compartments are functionally distinct, because barley lectin, a protein stored in root tips, is exclusively contained within the alpha-TIP compartment, while aleurain, a protease that serves as a marker for an acidified vacuolar environment, is exclusively contained within the TIP-Ma27 compartment. As cells develop large vacuoles, the two compartments merge; this may represent a process by which storage products in the alpha-TIP compartment are exposed to the acidic lytic TIP-Ma27 compartment for degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2035917634,"The T cytoplasm of maize serves as a model for the nuclear restoration of cytoplasmic male sterility. The rf2 gene, one of two nuclear genes required for fertility restoration in male-sterile T-cytoplasm (cmsT) maize, was cloned. The protein predicted by the rf2 sequence is a putative aldehyde dehydrogenase, which suggests several mechanisms that might explain Rf2-mediated fertility restoration in cmsT maize. Aldehyde dehydrogenase may be involved in the detoxification of acetaldehyde produced by ethanolic fermentation during pollen development, may play a role in energy metabolism, or may interact with URF13, the mitochondrial protein associated with male sterility in cmsT maize."
https://openalex.org/W2092058842,"Dual specificity protein phosphatases (DSPs) regulate mitogenic signal transduction and control the cell cycle. Here, the crystal structure of a human DSP, vaccinia H1-related phosphatase (or VHR), was determined at 2.1 angstrom resolution. A shallow active site pocket in VHR allows for the hydrolysis of phosphorylated serine, threonine, or tyrosine protein residues, whereas the deeper active site of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) restricts substrate specificity to only phosphotyrosine. Positively charged crevices near the active site may explain the enzyme's preference for substrates with two phosphorylated residues. The VHR structure defines a conserved structural scaffold for both DSPs and PTPs. A ""recognition region,"" connecting helix alpha1 to strand beta1, may determine differences in substrate specificity between VHR, the PTPs, and other DSPs."
https://openalex.org/W2042070050,"The saturated hydrocarbons ethane (C2H6) and methane (CH4) along with carbon monoxide (CO) and water (H2O) were detected in comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake with the use of high-resolution infrared spectroscopy at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The inferred production rates of molecular gases from the icy, cometary nucleus (in molecules per second) are 6.4 X 10(26) for C2H6, 1.2 X 10(27) for CH4, 9.8 X 10(27) for CO, and 1.7 X 10(29) for H2O. An abundance of C2H6 comparable to that of CH4 implies that ices in C/1996 B2 Hyakutake did not originate in a thermochemically equilibrated region of the solar nebula. The abundances are consistent with a kinetically controlled production process, but production of C2H6 by gas-phase ion molecule reactions in the natal cloud core is energetically forbidden. The high C2H6/CH4 ratio is consistent with production of C2H6 in icy grain mantles in the natal cloud, either by photolysis of CH4-rich ice or by hydrogen-addition reactions to acetylene condensed from the gas phase."
https://openalex.org/W1972317299,"<h2>Abstract</h2> The 70 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (pp70<sup>S6k</sup>) plays an important role in the progression of cells through G1 phase of the cell cycle. However, little is known of the signaling molecules that mediate its activation. We demonstrate that Rho family G proteins regulate pp70<sup>S6k</sup> activity in vivo. Activated alleles of Cdc42 and Rac1, but not RhoA, stimulate pp70<sup>S6k</sup> activity in multiple cell types. Activation requires an intact effector domain and isoprenylation of Cdc42 and Rac1. Coexpression of Dbl, an exchange factor for Cdc42, also activates pp70<sup>S6k</sup> . Growth factor–induced activation of pp70<sup>S6k</sup> is abrogated by dominant negative alleles of Cdc42 and Rac1. In addition, Cdc42 and Rac1 form a GTP-dependent complex with the catalytically inactive form of pp70<sup>S6k</sup> in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a mechanism by which these G proteins activate pp70<sup>S6k</sup>."
https://openalex.org/W2050130095,"The immunoglobulin alpha (Ig-alpha)-Ig-beta heterodimer is the signaling component of the antigen receptor complex on B cells (BCR) and B cell progenitors (pre-BCR). A mouse mutant that lacks most of the Ig-alpha cytoplasmic tail exhibits only a small impairment in early B cell development but a severe block in the generation of the peripheral B cell pool, revealing a checkpoint in B cell maturation that ensures the expression of a functional BCR on mature B cells. B cells that do develop demonstrate a differential dependence on Ig-alpha signaling in antibody responses such that a signaling-competent Ig-alpha appears to be critical for the response to T-independent, but not T-dependent, antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2081574196,"For more than two decades there has been intense debate over the hypothesis that most morphological evolution occurs during relatively brief episodes of rapid change that punctuate much longer periods of stasis. A clear and unambiguous case of punctuated evolution is presented for cell size in a population of Escherichia coli evolving for 3000 generations in a constant environment. The punctuation is caused by natural selection as rare, beneficial mutations sweep successively through the population. This experiment shows that the most elementary processes in population genetics can give rise to punctuated evolution dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2028123717,"Unesterified sterol modulates the function of eukaryotic membranes. In human cells, sterol is esterified to a storage form by acyl-coenzyme A (CoA): cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT). Here, two genes are identified, ARE1 and ARE2, that encode ACAT-related enzymes in yeast. The yeast enzymes are 49 percent identical to each other and exhibit 23 percent identity to human ACAT. Deletion of ARE2 reduced sterol ester levels to approximately 25 percent of normal levels, whereas disruption of ARE1 did not affect sterol ester biosynthesis. Deletion of both genes resulted in a viable cell with undetectable esterified sterol. Measurements of [14C]acetate incorporation into saponified lipids indicated down-regulation of sterol biosynthesis in the are1 are2 mutant cells. With the use of a consensus sequence to the yeast and human genes, an additional number of the ACAT gene family was identified in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2125735909,"The crystal structure of the ATP-dependent DNA ligase from bacteriophage T7 has been solved at 2.6 A resolution. The protein comprises two domains with a deep cleft running between them. The structure of a complex with ATP reveals that the nucleotide binding pocket is situated on the larger N-terminal domain, at the base of the cleft between the two domains of the enzyme. Comparison of the overall domain structure with that of DNA methyltransferases, coupled with other evidence, suggests that DNA also binds in this cleft. Since this structure is the first of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, which includes the eukaryotic mRNA capping enzymes, the relationship between the structure of DNA ligase and that of other nucleotidyltransferases is also discussed."

These mutations convert valine at position 642 to isoleucine, phenylalanine, or glycine. Expression of these mutant proteins, but not of normal APP695, was shown to induce nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in neuronal cells. Induction of DNA fragmentation required the cytoplasmic domain of the mutants and appeared to be mediated by heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins (G proteins)."
https://openalex.org/W2026995402,"In a previous study, an RNA aptamer for the specific recognition of arginine was evolved from a parent sequence that bound citrulline specifically. The two RNAs differ at only 3 positions out of 44. The solution structures of the two aptamers complexed to their cognate amino acids have now been determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Both aptamers contain two asymmetrical internal loops that are not well ordered in the free RNA but that fold into a compact structure upon ligand binding. Those nucleotides common to both RNAs include a conserved cluster of purine residues, three of which form an uneven plane containing a G:G pair, and two other residues nearly perpendicular to that surface. Two of the three variant nucleotides are stacked on the cluster of purines and form a triple contact to the amino acid side chain, whereas the edge of the third variant nucleotide is capping the binding pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1997450773,"An Arabidopsis thaliana mutant (mur1) has less than 2 percent of the normal amounts of L-fucose in the primary cell walls of aerial portions of the plant. The survival of mur1 plants challenged the hypothesis that fucose is a required component of biologically active oligosaccharides derived from cell wall xyloglucan. However, the replacement of L-fucose (that is, 6-deoxy-L-galactose) by L-galactose does not detectably alter the biological activity of the oligosaccharides derived from xyloglucan. Thus, essential structural and conformational features of xyloglucan and xyloglucan-derived oligosaccharides are retained when L-galactose replaces L-fucose."
https://openalex.org/W2058036227,"The centrosomin (cnn) gene encodes a protein associated with mitotic centrosomes in Drosophila melanogaster and is a target of homeotic gene regulation. Here we report that CNN is an essential component of the centrosome. Loss of zygotic cnn expression disrupts the development of the second midgut constriction, the gastric caeca, and the nervous system. Embryos that lack maternal as well as zygotic cnn expression display defects in nuclear division, chromosome alignment, and microtubule organization, while adult flies that are mosaic for cnn-cells exhibit defects indicative of a block in cell proliferation. We propose that cnn provides an example of homeotic genes directly regulating the accumulation of essential cellular proteins to carry out segment-specific morphogenetic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2071534440,ZPR1 is a zinc finger protein that binds to the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Deletion analysis demonstrated that this binding interaction is mediated by the zinc fingers of ZPR1 and subdomains X and XI of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. Treatment of mammalian cells with EGF caused decreased binding of ZPR1 to the EGFR and the accumulation of ZPR1 in the nucleus. The effect of EGF to regulate ZPR1 binding is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR. ZPR1 therefore represents a prototype for a class of molecule that binds to the EGFR and is released from the receptor after activation.
https://openalex.org/W2049447247,"Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a multigenic autoimmune disease. An IDDM susceptibility gene was mapped to chromosome 2q34. This gene may act early in diabetogenesis, because ""preclinical"" individuals also showed linkage. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-disparate, but not HLA-identical, sibs showed linkage, which was even stronger in families with affected females. The genes encoding insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins 2 and 5 were mapped to a 4-megabase pair interval near this locus. These results indicate the existence of a gene that acts at an early stage in IDDM development, screening for which may identify a specific subset of at-risk individuals."

https://openalex.org/W2052504672,"For unknown reasons, the eukaryotic transcription factor TFIID inefficiently recognizes promoters. Human TFIID was found to form highly specific homodimers that must dissociate before DNA binding. TFIID dimers formed through self-association of the TATA-binding polypeptide (TBP) subunit and could be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to TAF(II)250, the core subunit of TFIID. Chemical cross-linking experiments in HeLa cells revealed the presence of TBP dimers in vivo. These findings suggest that dimerization through TBP is the physiological state of TFIID when not bound to DNA. Thus, the inefficiency of TFIID binding to a promoter may be partly attributable to the competitive effect of dimerization."

Only one VSG is expressed at any time, except for short periods during switching. The reasons for this pattern of expression and the consequences of expressing more than one VSG are unknown. Trypanosoma brucei was genetically manipulated to generate cell lines that expressed two VSGs simultaneously. These VSGs were produced in equal amounts and were homogeneously distributed on the trypanosome surface. The double-expressor cells had similar population doubling times and were as infective as wild-type cells. Thus, the simultaneous expression of two VSGs is not intrinsically harmful."

These neuroactive compounds could be identified from their electrophoretic migration times, unitary channel conductances, and power spectra that yielded corner frequencies and mean single-channel conductances characteristic for each of the different agonist-receptor interactions. This technique has the sensitivity to observe the opening of a single ion channel for agonists separated by capillary electrophoresis."
