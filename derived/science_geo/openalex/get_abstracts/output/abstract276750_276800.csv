https://openalex.org/W1982129609,"Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analyses of desert varnish reveal that microorganisms concentrate ambient manganese that becomes greatly enhanced in brown to black varnish. Specific characteristics of desert varnish and of varnish bacteria support a microbial origin for manganese-rich films. Varnish microbes can be cultured and produce laboratory manganese films. Accordingly, natural desert varnish and also manganese-rich rock varnishes in nondesert environments appear to be a product of microbial activity."

During this period, CO decreased at nearly a constant rate in the high northern latitudes. In contrast, in the tropics an abrupt decrease occurred beginning at the end of 1991. In the Northern Hemisphere, CO decreased at a spatially and temporally averaged rate of 7.3 (±0.9) parts per billion per year (6.1 percent per year) from June 1990 to June 1993, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere, CO decreased 4.2 (±0.5) parts per billion per year (7.0 percent per year). This recent change is opposite a long-term trend of a 1 to 2 percent per year increase inferred from measurements made in the Northern Hemisphere during the past 30 years."
https://openalex.org/W2020002203,"The development of in vitro fertilization systems in flowering plants is important for understanding and controlling the mechanisms of fertilization. Here a method is described in which isolated maize gametes fuse. In a medium containing 5 mM calcium chloride, sperm and egg cells adhere for several minutes and then fuse within 10 seconds. The method is specific to male-female gamete pairs and results in 80 percent fusion, whereas fusions with other combinations of gametic and mesophyllic cells are less frequent. Eggs fertilized in vitro do not fuse with additional male gametes, which suggests that a block to polyspermy exists."
https://openalex.org/W2027945587,"Empty shells of spinose planktonic foraminifera on the seabed are significantly enriched in oxygen-18 as compared with the shells of their living counterparts in surface waters. This enrichment is due to gametogenic calcification, which extracts calcium carbonate from deeper and colder waters as the shell sinks below the euphotic zone."
https://openalex.org/W1976982174,"The serpent's forked tongue has intrigued humankind for millennia, but its function has remained obscure. Theory, anatomy, neural circuitry, function, and behavior now support a hypothesis of the forked tongue as a chemosensory edge detector used to follow pheromone trails of prey and conspecifics. The ability to sample simultaneously two points along a chemical gradient provides the basis for instantaneous assessment of trail location. Forked tongues have evolved at least twice, possibly four times, among squamate reptiles, and at higher taxonomic levels, forked tongues are always associated with a wide searching mode of foraging. The evolutionary success of advanced snakes might be due, in part, to perfection of this mechanism and its role in reproduction."

https://openalex.org/W1998111808,"Ponderosa pine twigs collected from trees used by tassel-eared squirrels as sources of cortical tissue for food contained smaller amounts of monoterpenes than twigs from similar trees not used by the squirrels as food sources. Of the 18 monoterpenes isolated from the twig samples, α-pinene was the best single predictor of food source trees. In experiments with captive tassel-eared squirrels, consumption of a preferred food was inversely correlated with the concentration of α-pinene added to the food."
https://openalex.org/W2027750074,"Two closely related and coexisting plants (Chenopodiaceae) of the Australian arid zone are adapted for seed dispersal by ants. These facultatively perennial shrubs persist in saltbush communities largely as a result of highly directional dispersal to ant mounds, where conditions are favorable for establishment and growth. The two species grow predominantly on mounds and compete for dispersal to these favorable microhabitats."
https://openalex.org/W2014222742,"Sound velocities in fluid and crystalline hydrogen were measured under pressure to 24 gigapascals by Brillouin spectroscopy in the diamond anvil cell. The results provide constraints on the intermolecular interactions of dense hydrogen and are used to construct an intermolecular potential consistent with all available data. Fluid perturbation theory calculations with the potential indicate that sound velocities in hydrogen at conditions of the molecular layer of the Jovian planets are lower than previously believed. Jovian models consistent with the present results remain discrepant with recent free oscillation spectra of the planet by 15 percent. The effect of changing interior temperatures, the metallic phase transition depth, and the fraction of high atomic number material on Jovian oscillation frequencies is also investigated with the Brillouin equation of state. The present data place strong constraints on sound velocities in the Jovian molecular layer and provide an improved basis for interpreting possible Jovian oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2070294563,"The growth of small ( approximately 10-micrometer) diamond particles (on 0.1-or 0.25-micrometer seed crystals) using an effusive glow discharge nozzle for H.and a separate supersonic pyrolysis jet for .CH(3) is reported. Laser micro-Raman, scanning electron microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data are presented as evidence that well-crystallized diamond is indeed formed. Resonant multiphoton ionization spectroscopy is used as a diagnostic for the gas-phase chemistry indicating that the radical sources are clean and quantitative and that there is no detectable interconversion of .CH(3) to C(2)H(2) under the conditions of the experiment. Diamond growth is found at substrate temperatures greater than or equal to 650 degrees C with no marked increase in the rate of growth up to 850 degrees C. Acetylene does not give good quality diamond under similar conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2017142202,The neodymium isotope and samarium-neodymium systematics of 2.7-billion-year-old mantle-derived magmas indicate that the lifetime of chemical heterogeneities was much shorter in the Archean mantle than in the modern mantle. Isotopic evidence is compatible with a Rayleigh number 100 times larger and convection 10 times faster in the Late Archean compared with the present-day mantle. Modern plate tectonics thus may be an improbable analog for the Archean. Chemical heterogeneities in the mantle may originate upon magma migration and mineralogical phase changes rather than by recycling of oceanic and continental crust.
https://openalex.org/W2003117832,"Sodium silicoglycolate, an organosilicon compound in which silicon is in 5-coordination with respect to oxygen, is shown to be a reaction intermediate in the synthesis of a purely siliceous sodalite with ethylene glycol as solvent. The presence of silicon-29 nuclear magnetic resonances at -105.5 +/- 0.3 parts per million in solution and -102.7 parts per million in the solid state as well as x-ray powder diffraction patterns demonstrate that 5-coordinate silicon is intimately involved in the synthesis. Silicon compounds of the 5-coordinate type are highly reactive and are promising starting materials for the synthesis of novel silicone polymers, molecular sieves, glasses, semiconductors, and ceramics. We have used sodium silicoglycolate to prepare the molecular sieve silicalite as well as sodalites of different compositions."
