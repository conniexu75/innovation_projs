This effect is generally regarded as an inhibition of fermentation by respiration, for example, as a result of a lack of inorganic phosphate (Pi) or adenosine diphosphate (ADP)1,2."

They are often multiple, frequently recur following surgical excision or radiotherapy, and generally have fibropapillomatous features. Horses, donkeys and mules are susceptible. Neither a seasonal incidence nor an age distribution of equine sarcoids has been detected2. Jackson pointed out that the gross and microscopic appearance of the tumours, the predilection sites, and the pattern of spread to secondary sites on affected animals were suggestive of viral aetiology. Auto- and homo-transplantation have been reported3–6. Voss recently reported that several tumours were produced in horses with centrifuged sarcoid extracts which probably were cell-free although they had not been filtered5. Intrader-mal inoculation of bovine papilloma virus in horses produced localized, fibroblastic growths similar to equine sarcoid which suggests the interesting possibility of a causal relationship to equine sarcoid7. Equine sarcoid has no known relationship to Boeck's sarcoid in man."

https://openalex.org/W1975104829,"OUR knowledge of the pathways of steroid biosynthesis in the ovary has been gained mainly by incubations of ovaries in vitro1,2. The tissues incubated have contained numerous cell types: granulosa cells, theca interna cells, stromal cells, interstitial cells, and sometimes luteal cells. Possibly such mixtures of two or more different cell types are able to secrete hormones that one cell type cannot secrete by itself3–9. Furthermore, during such incubations in vitro an exchange of precursors and products between different cell types may be facilitated because of breakdown of naturally occurring barriers, such as the basement membrane between the granulosa layer and the theca interna of the follicle."

https://openalex.org/W2090085813,"Calam, Todd and Waring1 reported that almost as many eggs of the potato cyst-nematode, Heterodera rostochiensis, were stimulated to hatch by a 3 mM aqueous solution of anhydrotetronic acid as by potato root diffusate; other tetronic acid derivatives they synthesized did not stimulate hatching. Marrian, Russell and Todd2 synthesized various compounds based on an α-arylidene-Δβ:γ-butenolide skeleton and reported that two of these, α-(p-hydroxybenzylidene)-γ-methyl-Δβ:γ-butenolide and α-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzylidene)-γ-methyl-Δβ:γ-butenolide, “showed definite activity” at a concentration of 0.1–0.5 mM, whereas the rest were inactive or only slightly active. That anhydrotetronic acid is a good synthetic hatching agent has been confirmed4–6, and in our tests, at 3 mM concentration, its hatch rating3 was 90 (potato root diffusate = 100, water = 0), whereas 0.1–0.05 mM α-(p-hydroxybenzylidene) -γ-methyl-Δβ:γ-butenolide was only slightly active (hatch rating 7)."

https://openalex.org/W2005943171,"CALCIFICATION in the testes of bulls has been the subject of a few reports over several decades1–3. Accounts of the condition have been mainly concerned with its incidence in surveys and theories on its aetiology. It is established now that the condition is usually bilateral in its occurrence, varies in degree, and is by no means rare. There is general support for a hypothesis that semen statis is a fundamental factor in the development of the condition4,5. Doubt has been cast on the reproductive significance of such calcification with the statement that, per se, it does not necessarily indicate infertility3. The association between the condition and fertility has not otherwise been closely considered."

He further suggested that they break down on silicic acid to give moieties having the currently accepted structures of the known phospholipids1,2. Considerations of stability led de Koning to put forward alternative structures involving pyrophosphate bonds3."

https://openalex.org/W1979452773,"MAMMALIAN germ cells have been utilized by several investigators for the investigation of the biochemical and physiological mechanisms of senescence in living cells1. Functionally and metabolically active bovine sperm have been successfully maintained and studied at room temperature for a period of 6 days or more2. The results of these studies led to the present work in which two chemically defined media were used to maintain large numbers of vigorously motile rabbit sperm. The two media tested here were ‘Coconut Milk Extender’ (CME)3 and Norman-Johnson solution No. 2 (N-J-2)4, a chemically defined medium. Over a 6 day period of storage at room temperature (24° ± 2° C), N-J-2 proved to be the more satisfactory medium for supporting survival and activity of the sperm."

https://openalex.org/W2061291113,"THERE is evidence that the number or size of the cell inoculum, the site of inoculation, the host of origin or the conditioning of the host1 can alter the strain specificity of neoplasms and that some neoplasms can be transplanted from strain of origin and grow progressively in homologous strains with the animals dying of the neoplastic disease. Greene2 reported the successful transplantation of heterologous neoplasms into the brains of rats and mice and suggested that the brain might be exempt from any immunological response."

https://openalex.org/W1995395517,"A SURVEY of the parasites of the trout, char, stickleback, minnow and eel in Llyn Padarn was begun in April 1963. The trout Salmo trutta L. and the char Salvelinus alpinus perisii (Günther) were heavily infected by the plerocercoids of Diphyllobothrium ditremum (Creplin, 1825) and Diphyllobothrium dendriticum (Nitzsch, 1824) which were found encapsuled in the viscera and body wall. The parasite survey was continued in 1964 when a marked fall in the occurrence of Diphyllobothrium plerocercoids in the trout was noted. Observations made in 1965 showed a further fall in the numbers of the plerocercoids in the trout. The numbers of plerocercoids present in the char remained more or less constant throughout the period of investigation (see Table 1)."
https://openalex.org/W2013361721,"IT is known that certain, chemical agents can influence the differentiation of the ectoderm and the entomeso-derm in the larva of the sea urchin. Thus certain acidic organic derivatives which carry sulphonic groups tend to favour the differentiation of ectodermic structures (animalization). The animalizing activity of these agents increases with their affinity for proteins1."

This extraction process removes unhealthy substances and improves the flavour and aroma of such leaves when they are used as a smoking product. The extracted leaf is reconstituted, preferably to its original weight, by adding back non-toxic chemical agents which enhance the burning qualities, flavour and aroma."

https://openalex.org/W2043012799,"IN the course of a continuous survey1,2 on the occurrence and levels of activity of ornithine–urea cycle3 enzymes, an unexpected opportunity was afforded for quantitative measurement of these activities in the instance of the African lion, Felis leo. At the Vilas Park Zoo in Madison (Wisconsin) the director, Mr. Dan Watson, decided that an infirm male lion about twelve years old had to be destroyed. The lion exhibited progressive difficulty in its ability to leap to a platform some 2 m high in the cage; this created a feeding problem and difficulty in moving the animal to an outside exercise yard."
https://openalex.org/W2060965811,"THE injection of pregnant rats with certain antimeta-bolites, such as ethionine, in sub-lethal doses, may result in resorption or stillbirth1–4. We wish to report the effect of smaller, repeated doses of ethionine on the course and outcome of pregnancy in rats. Daily subcutaneous injections, in the doses listed in Table 1, were given from the twelfth day of pregnancy until delivery. Control animals received saline injections. All injections were in a volume of 1 ml. The date of conception was established by the first appearance of sperm on vaginal smears."
