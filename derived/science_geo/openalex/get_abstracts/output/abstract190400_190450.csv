https://openalex.org/W2055458093,"IT has long been known that when a fertilized egg is flattened between two plates it may cease to divide. Zeuthen1 has shown recently that although cell division is inhibited, nuclear division may continue, so that many nuclei may be present in a single flattened cell. I obtained essentially similar results during the summer of 1951, at Roscoff. It Was found that, if the egg was not too greatly compressed, it would eventually divide and, once division set in, cleavage of the cytoplasm would continue until the normal ratio of one nucleus to one cell was re-established."

https://openalex.org/W2412571631,"Edlbacher and Neber (1) showed in 1934 that the liver enzyme named histidase degrades histidine to NH3, formic acid, and an unknown product which on further treatment with strong alkali yields glutamic acid. This led to the suggestion that glutamic acid is a metabolic product of histidine, a suggestion that was supported by the finding that glycogen was formed from histidine about as well as from glutamic acid (2). These findings did not prove that glutamic acid was one of the products of histidine metabolism, and the idea became questionable when the evidence from subsequent investigations with non-isotopic histidine (3), imidazole-N16-histidine (4), and carboxyl-C14-histidine (5) were negative or inconclusive. 

In studies on the fate of carboxyl-C14-L-histidine in the liver of rabbits after injection and after incubation with guinea pig liver slices, we have found direct evidence that glutamic acid is a major product of histdine metabolism. Another highly radioactive compound was isolated by ion exchange chromatography, whose properties with respect to chromatography and lability to alkali and acid appear to correspond to those reported for isoglutamine. Takeuchi (6) isolated and identified isoglutamine as a product of the action of urocanicase on urocanic acid, which was obtained by the action of another liver enzyme on histidine. The formation of isoglutamine as an intermediate is consistent with our finding that the label in the radioactive glutamic acid formed from carboxyl-C14-histidine is not in the α-carboxyl group, and the inference is very strong that the label is in the γ-carboxyl group."

https://openalex.org/W2087744509,"THE yolk and white of the hen's egg show wide differences in osmotic pressure, pH and ionic composition, which are maintained for a long period of time on storage. This has frequently been supposed to result from a property of the vitelline membrane which separates the two phases, although J. Needham, who has recently reviewed this subject1, has concluded that there must be the co-operation of some physical property of the yolk and white."
https://openalex.org/W2034330878,"THE belief that the word ‘chromatography’ was coined by Tswett1 about 1906 is incorrect; it appears to have been widely used, though with a different connotation, for more than a century and a half previously. As so often happens, Tswett appears merely to have adopted an existing word and given it an additional meaning. Paradoxically, many modern works of reference define chromatography in every way but the one which would first spring to the mind of a chemist."

https://openalex.org/W2072329980,"THIS preliminary communication on the inhibition of acid secretion in vivo in dogs by one of a new group of potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is prompted by the recent report of Davies and Edelman1, which has appeared since our work was completed. These workers have shown that several other known carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which include prontosil, p-toluenesulphonamide, p-sulphonamidobenzoate and thiophene-2-sulphonamide, can suppress the in vitro acid secretion of the isolated frog and toad gastric mucosa, although sulphanilamide was without effect."
