https://openalex.org/W2039954136,"A luminous X-ray source is associated with MGG 11—a cluster of young stars ∼200 pc from the centre of the starburst galaxy M 82 (refs 1, 2). The properties of this source are best explained3,4 by invoking a black hole with a mass of at least 350 solar masses (350 M⊙), which is intermediate between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. A nearby but somewhat more massive cluster (MGG 9) shows no evidence of such an intermediate-mass black hole1,3, raising the issue of just what physical characteristics of the clusters can account for this difference. Here we report numerical simulations of the evolution and motion of stars within the clusters, where stars are allowed to merge with each other. We find that for MGG 11 dynamical friction leads to the massive stars sinking rapidly to the centre of the cluster, where they participate in a runaway collision. This produces a star of 800–3,000 M⊙, which ultimately collapses to a black hole of intermediate mass. No such runaway occurs in the cluster MGG 9, because the larger cluster radius leads to a mass segregation timescale a factor of five longer than for MGG 11."

https://openalex.org/W1993731501,"The NF-κB family of transcription factors plays a pivotal role in regulation of diverse biological processes, including immune responses, cell growth, and apoptosis. Activation of NF-κB is mediated by both canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways. Although the canonical pathway has been extensively studied, the mechanism mediating the noncanonical pathway is still poorly understood. Recent studies have identified the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) as a key component of the noncanonical pathway of NF-κB activation; however, how the signaling function of NIK is regulated remains unknown. We report here that one important mechanism of NIK regulation is through its dynamic interaction with the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). TRAF3 physically associates with NIK via a specific sequence motif located in the N-terminal region of NIK; this molecular interaction appears to target NIK for degradation by the proteasome. Interestingly, induction of noncanonical NF-κB signaling by extracellular signals involves degradation of TRAF3 and the concomitant enhancement of NIK expression. These results suggest that induction of noncanonical NF-κB signaling may involve the rescue of NIK from TRAF3-mediated negative regulation.

These results suggest that induction of noncanonical NF-κB signaling may involve the rescue of NIK from TRAF3-mediated negative regulation. The transcription factor NF-κB regulates genes involved in diverse biological processes, such as immune and inflammatory responses, cell growth, and apoptosis (1Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 69: 6910-6924Crossref Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 2Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 3Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). NF-κB represents a family of dimeric DNA-binding proteins, composed of RelA, RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (or p50), and NF-κB2 (or p52) (4Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 are produced as inactive precursors, p105 and p100, which undergo proteasome-mediated processing to generate the mature proteins, p50 and p52, respectively (4Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). Although various NF-κB complexes have been identified, the predominant forms of NF-κB are the heterodimers formed between the Rel proteins and p50 or p52. The NF-κB dimers are normally sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes with a family of ankyrin repeat-containing inhibitors, including IκBα and related proteins (5Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB can be stimulated by a large variety of cellular stimuli, such as cytokines, mitogens, DNA-damaging agents, and microbial components (6Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). The canonical pathway of NF-κB activation is mediated by a large IκB kinase (IKK) 1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; NIK, NF-κB inducing kinase; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; BaffR, Baff receptor; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small inhibitory RNAs; GFP, green fluorescence protein; IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblotting; HA, hemagglutinin; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase.1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; NIK, NF-κB inducing kinase; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; BaffR, Baff receptor; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small inhibitory RNAs; GFP, green fluorescence protein; IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblotting; HA, hemagglutinin; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. complex, composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit termed IKKγ (also named NEMO, IKKAP1, or FIP-3) (6Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Upon activation by the various NF-κB stimuli, IKK phosphorylates IκBα, triggering its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome, which results in rapid and transient nuclear translocation of the active NF-κB dimers. Another mechanism of NF-κB regulation is through proteolytic processing of p105 and p100. In addition to serving as the precursors of p50 and p52, p105 and p100 function as IκB-like molecules (7Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A.

A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The processing of these precursor proteins not only leads to generation of p50 and p52 but also results in disruption of the IκB-like function of these precursor proteins. Recent studies suggest that although the processing of p105 is largely constitutive and cotranslational (10Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the processing of p100 is tightly regulated by both positive and negative mechanisms (11Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Induction of p100 processing is mediated by a noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway that relies on the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (11Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) as well as its downstream kinase IKKα (12Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Kraehn G. Greten F. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.-C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). This novel pathway of NF-κB activation does not require IKKβ and IKKγ (12Senftleben U. Cao Y.

Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). In addition to producing p52, the processing of p100 is required for liberating RelB, allowing this specific NF-κB member to move to the nucleus and exert its gene regulation function (16Solan N.J.

Genetic evidence suggests that the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway plays a key regulatory role in maturation of B cells and development of lymphoid organs (12Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G.

Consistently, this novel pathway of NF-κB activation is regulated by a subset of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family members known to be important for B-cell function and lymphoid organogenesis, including Baff receptor (BaffR), CD40, and lymphotoxin β receptor (14Claudio E. Brown K. Park S. Wang H. Siebenlist U. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 17Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G.

How the different receptors mediate activation of the noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway remains unclear. The TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) proteins may play an important role, since they are known to be recruited to various TNFR family members (24Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a common TRAF molecule recruited by the different noncanonical NF-κB-stimulating receptors (BaffR, CD40, and lymphotoxin β receptor) is TRAF3 (25Kuhne M.R. Robbins M. Hambor J.E. Mackey M.F. Kosaka Y. Nishimura T. Gigley J.P. Noelle R.J. Calderhead D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Xu L.-G. Shu H.-B. J.

Chem. 2003; 16: 14363-14369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (49) Google Scholar), although the role of this adaptor protein in regulation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway remains unclear. In the present study, we show that TRAF3 is a negative regulator of NIK, a key signaling molecule involved in noncanonical NF-κB activation. TRAF3 physically interacts with NIK and targets NIK for degradation by the proteasome. Remarkably, the receptor-mediated activation of noncanonical NF-κB signaling is associated with persistent degradation of TRAF3 and the marked elevation of NIK expression. These findings suggest that induction of the noncanonical NF-κB signaling involves rescue of NIK from TRAF3-mediated destruction. Plasmid Constructs—HA-ubiquitin has been described previously (11Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 13Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). HA-NIK was created by cloning the human NIK cDNA, together with a C-terminal HA tag, into the pCMV4 expression vector (28Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21081-21085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Truncation mutants of NIK were generated by PCR and designated by the specific amino acid residues retained in the mutant proteins. For example, NIK-(152–947) contains the region from amino acid 152 to 947. NIK mutants harboring internal deletions were produced by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using wild type NIK expression vector as template. To generate the HA-tagged TRAFs, human TRAF1 and TRAF3 and murine TRAF2 cDNAs were cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR and inserted into the pcDNA-HA vector (29Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22911-22914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) downstream of an HA tag. Truncation mutants of TRAF3 were created by PCR. The retroviral expression vectors encoding NIK, NIKΔ78–84 (NIK harboring deletion of amino acids 78–84), and TRAF3 were constructed by inserting the corresponding cDNA into the pCLXSN retroviral vector (provided by Dr. Inder M. Verma (30Naviaux R.N. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The expression vector encoding human p100 was provided by Dr. Warner C. Greene. Antibodies and Other Reagents—The antibodies for NIK (H248), TRAF3 (H122), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated TRAF3, TRAF2 (C-20), tubulin (TU-02), and RelB (C-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated HA monoclonal antibody (3F10) was from Roche Applied Science. Anti-mouse CD40 antibody was purchased from PharMingen. The anti-p100 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Warner C. Greene. Recombinant IKKα was a gift from Dr. Michael Karin. Human recombinant Baff was purchased from BIOSOURCE. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem and used at a dose of 25 μm. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the MATCHMAKER LexA two-hybrid system (Clontech). A cDNA fragment encoding the N-terminal 710 amino acids of NIK was cloned into the pLexA vector downstream of the DNA binding domain of LexA to generate the pLexA-NIK-(1–710) bait. This bait was used to screen a Jurkat T cell library constructed using pB42AD vector (human leukemia MATCHMAKER LexA cDNA library; Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Putative positive clones were retransformed to the yeast strain with pLexA-NIK-(1–710) or a nonspecific bait, pLexA-lamin. After this step of false positive elimination, specific clones were subjected to DNA sequencing and subsequent BLAST search analyses. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Retroviral Infection—M12.4.1 B cell line (31Hamano T. Kim K.J. Leiserson W.M. Asofsky R. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1403-1406PubMed Google Scholar) and its derivative stably transfected with hCD40 (M12-hCD40) (32Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Gail A. Bishop. The M12-NIK cells were created by infecting the M12-hCD40 cells with the pCLXSN-NIK retroviral vector as previously described (33Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and bulk-infected cells were used in the experiments. All of these B-cell lines were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, antibiotics, and 10 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. The kidney carcinoma cell line 293 was cultured in Dulbecco's medium with the same supplements. The 293-NIK, 293-NIKΔ78–84, and 293-TRAF3 cells were constructed by infecting 293 cells with retroviruses carrying the corresponding cDNAs. Sequential infections were used to generate cells expressing two or more exogenous genes. Transient transfection of 293 cells was carried out in 6-well tissue culture plates using DEAE-dextran (34Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA (expression vectors plus carrier DNA) was 2 μg/well, with the amounts of individual expression vectors being adjusted to achieve similar levels of protein expression. In Vitro Translation—In vitro translation was performed using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Immunoblotting (IB) and Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) Assays—Whole-cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and one-hundredth volume of a protease inhibitor mixture (35Ballard D.W. Walker W.H. Doerre S. Sista P. Molitor J.A. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J. Hannink M. Greene W.C. Cell. 1990; 63: 803-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)). To prepare subcellular extracts, the cells were lysed in buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to obtain the cytoplasmic fraction, and the nuclear pellets were washed once with buffer B and then extracted for 10 min in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to IB using the indicated antibodies. For co-IP assays, whole-cell lysates (∼250 μg for transfected 293 cells and ∼500 μg for M12 B cells) were diluted to 500 μl using radioimmune precipitation buffer and precleared for 30 min with a preimmune serum and protein A-agarose. The precleared cell lysates were then incubated with the indicated antibodies (6 μl) for 1 h and with protein A-agarose (30 μl) for another 2 h. The agarose beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted in 2× SDS loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and IB analyses. In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro kinase assays were performed as previously described (36Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIK and NIKΔ78–84 were isolated by IP from transiently transfected 293 cells and then incubated with its substrate, recombinant IKKα (25 ng), in a kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated IKKα as well as autophosphorylated NIK proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Cell Labeling and Pulse-Chase Assays—293 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran. At 30 h posttransfection, the cells were starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine and then metabolically labeled for 30 min with 350 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine. The pulse-labeled cells were either immediately lysed or chased for the indicated times in regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm cold methionine. The cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer and subjected to IP using anti-NIK antibody. The radiolabeled NIK proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. RNA Interference (RNAi)—Small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) specific for human TRAF3 or the green fluorescence protein (GFP) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sequences of the oligonucleotides are as follows: GFP siRNA, GCU ACC UGU UCC AUG GCC ATT (sense) and UGG CCA UGG AAC AGG UAG CTT (antisense); TRAF3 siRNA, AGA GUC AGG UUC CGA UGA UTT (sense) and AUC AUC GGA ACC UGA CUC UTT (antisense). For siRNA delivery, 293 cells were seeded into 6-well plates to around 70% confluence. After 12–16 h, the cells were transfected with 140 pmol of siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). To maximize the efficiency of RNAi, the transfection was repeated at 24 h following the first transfection. The highest efficiency of RNAi was achieved when the second transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), in which the siRNA was mixed with 300 ng of carrier DNA (pcDNA). Accordingly, this strategy (an Oligofectamine transfection followed by a LipofectAMINE transfection) was used in this study. At about 30 h after the second transfection, the cells were collected for preparation of protein lysates. The efficiency of RNAi-mediated gene suppression was monitored by IB. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA was prepared from the indicated cells and subjected to reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis as described (33Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using the following primers: NIK, CAT GCA GAC AGG CAC CCC AC (forward) and CGA ACA ATA TTG AAG TAG CCA GC (reverse); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, CTA CTG GCG CTG CCA AGG C (forward) and GTG GGT GTC GCT GTT GAA GTC (reverse). Identification of TRAF3 as a Major NIK-associated Protein—We have previously shown that the N-terminal region of NIK contains regulatory sequences that appear to inhibit the function of NIK (28Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21081-21085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to investigate whether this negative regulatory region associates with any cellular factors involved in NIK regulation. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening using the N-terminal portion of NIK (NIK1–710) as bait. A clone that was frequently isolated encoded the C-terminal portion of TRAF3. Although several other TRAF members have been shown to interact with NIK (37Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 38Song H. Regnier C. Kirschning C. Goeddel D. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), none of them were identified using this bait. This result was consistent with the previous finding that the common TRAF-binding site of NIK is located at its C terminus (37Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 38Song H. Regnier C. Kirschning C. Goeddel D. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), which was missing in the bait used in our screening. To confirm the NIK/TRAF3 physical interaction in mammalian cells, co-IP was performed using transfected 293 cells. Indeed, NIK and TRAF3 formed a stable complex, which was readily precipitated from the cell lysates by the anti-NIK antibody (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 3). Interestingly, parallel IP assays revealed that the interaction of NIK with TRAF3 was markedly stronger than that with TRAF1 and TRAF2 (lanes 1 and 2). This result was not due to the variation in protein expression, since the cell lysates contained even higher amounts of TRAF1 and TRAF2 than TRAF3 (bottom panel). We also performed binding assays using in vitro translated NIK and TRAF3 and demonstrated their strong interaction under such in vitro conditions (Fig. 1B). Together with the yeast two-hybrid results, these findings suggest that TRAF3 is a major partner protein of NIK and that the N-terminal region of NIK may contain a domain specifically mediating its strong interaction with TRAF3. To map the domain of NIK mediating its interaction with TRAF3, a panel of deletion mutants of NIK was subjected to TRAF3-binding assays. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid assays, two NIK mutants containing the N-terminal portion (1–736 and 1–710) were capable of TRAF3 association (Fig. 1C, top panel, lanes 4 and 5). On the other hand, a NIK mutant lacking the N-terminal 151 amino acids (positions 152–947) was largely defective in binding to TRAF3 (lane 3). A NIK mutant harboring an internal deletion of amino acids 30–120 (Δ30–120) also exhibited a severe defect in TRAF3 association (lane 2). Additional truncation analyses revealed that the N-terminal 29 amino acids of NIK were dispensable for its TRAF3-binding function (Fig. 1C, upper panel, lanes 8–10). These results, which are summarized in Fig. 1D, suggest that the N-terminal TRAF3-binding domain of NIK is located between amino acids 30 and 120. A Specific Sequence Motif of NIK Is Required for Its Strong Interaction with TRAF3—Prior studies suggest that TRAF3 binds to target proteins via a conserved sequence motif, PX-QX(S/T), which is also recognized by TRAF2 and certain other TRAF members (39van Kooten C. Banchereau J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). However, the TRAF3-binding domain of NIK does not contain such a motif. The preferential binding of NIK to a specific TRAF member, TRAF3, also suggests the involvement of a novel interaction mechanism. To systematically define the TRAF3-binding motif of NIK, we generated a large panel of NIK mutants harboring various internal deletions in the TRAF3-binding domain (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, most of the sequences in this domain were dispensable for TRAF3 binding; these include those covering amino acids 31–50 (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 3), 51–70 (lane 4), and 91–120 (lane 6). However, a region covering amino acids 71–90 was essential for the TRAF3-binding activity of NIK, since removal of this region largely abolished the NIK/TRAF3 interaction (lane 5). More detailed deletion analyses within this region revealed a sequence motif ISIIAQA (located between amino acids 78 and 84; see Fig. 2A) that was critical for the TRAF3-binding function of NIK. Deletion of this sequence motif generated a NIK mutant, NIKΔ78–84, which was largely defective in TRAF3 binding (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 9). On the other hand, removal of the flanking sequence downstream of this TRAF3-binding motif (amino acids 85–90) had no effect on the NIK/TRAF3 interaction (lane 10), although removal of the upstream flanking sequence (amino acids 71–77) caused a partial reduction (lane 8). These biochemical analyses, summarized in Fig. 2A, suggest that the strong interaction of NIK with TRAF3 requires a specific sequence motif (ISIIAQA) located in the N-terminal region of NIK. We then determined the domain within TRAF3 that is required for its binding to NIK. As depicted in Fig. 2C, TRAF3 contains three major domains: a ring finger (RF) domain, a zinc finger (ZF) domain, and a TRAF domain. Co-IP assays were performed to detect the interaction between NIK and TRAF3 mutants lacking the different domains. Deletion of the ring finger domain of TRAF3 had no effect on its interaction with NIK (Fig. 2D, top panel, lane 2; also see summary in Fig. 2C). Further deletion of the zinc finger domain also did not abolish the NIK-binding function of TRAF3 (lane 3). On the other hand, the removal of 120 amino acids from the C terminus of TRAF3, which disrupted the TRAF domain, completely abolished its interaction with NIK (lane 4). Thus, the C-terminal TRAF domain of TRAF3 is required for its interaction with NIK. Transfected TRAF3 Inhibits the Signaling Function of NIK—To investigate the functional significance of NIK/TRAF3 interaction, we examined the effect of TRAF3 on NIK-induced p100 processing. As expected (11Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), expression of NIK in 293 cells resulted in the induction of p100 processing, as demonstrated by generation of the processing product p52 (Fig. 3A, top panel, lane 2). Interestingly, this signaling function of NIK was inhibited by TRAF3 in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 3 and 4). A C-terminal truncation mutant of TRAF3, TRAF-(1–423), failed to inhibit the NIK-mediated induction of p100 processing (lanes 6 and 7). Since the TRAF3-(1–423) is defective in NIK binding (see Fig. 2D), it raised the possibility that the TRAF3/NIK interaction is required for the negative regulation of NIK by TRAF3. To further confirm this idea, we examined the inhibitory effect of TRAF3 on NIKΔ78–84, a NIK mutant lacking the TRAF3-binding motif (see Fig. 2, A and B). This NIK mutant retained its function in inducing p100 processing (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 5). In fact, it exhibited elevated function compared with the wild type NIK (compare lanes 2 and 5). Importantly, the signaling function of NIKΔ78–84 was no longer inhibited by TRAF3 (lanes 6 and 7). This result further suggests that the TRAF3/NIK physical interaction is required for TRAF3-mediated negative regulation of NIK. Parallel kinase assays revealed that deletion of the TRAF3-binding sequence of NIK did not alter its catalytic activity. Both NIK and NIKΔ78–84 exhibited strong activity in autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the target IKKα (Fig. 3C). TRAF3/NIK Interaction Targets NIK Degradation through the Proteasome—In the transient transfection studies, we noticed that the level of NIK was reduced in cells cotransfected with TRAF3 (see Fig. 3, A and B, middle panel, lanes 3 and 4). This result was unlikely to be due to transfection variation, since it was observed in multiple experiments (data not shown). Further, the effect of TRAF3 on NIK expression appeared to require their physical interaction, since the C-terminal truncation mutant of TRAF3-(1–423) defective in NIK binding did not alter the level of NIK expression (Fig. 3A, middle panel, lanes 6 and 7). Similarly, the expression of NIKΔ78–84, a NIK mutant incapable of TRAF3 binding, was not affecte"

In particular, we show that for large networks on which flows are influenced or generated by gradients of a scalar distributed on the nodes, scale-free structures will ensure efficient processing, whereas structures that are not scale-free, such as random graphs, will become congested."

In the context of hypermutating B cells, AID deaminates cytosine in the DNA of immunoglobulin genes, leading to the accumulation of mutations in the variable regions. However, when AID is expressed ectopically, it is a generalized mutator of G:C base pairs. Therefore, we asked whether AID may be partially regulated by an active system of nuclear export. We found that removal of a highly conserved nuclear export signal in the C terminus of AID causes accumulation of AID in the nucleus.

Our understanding of the molecular basis of somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes was greatly enhanced by the discovery of a novel cytosine deaminase (AID) (4Muramatsu M.

Science. 2002; 295: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Given its homology to the RNA-editing enzyme Apobec-1, it was speculated that the substrate for deamination by AID may be cytosine in the RNA transcript encoding a molecule critical to SHM, CSR, and gene conversion. Instead, recent data suggest that the target of AID is the DNA encoding the V and switch regions of immunoglobulin genes. In a study by Neuberger and co-workers (8Rada C. Williams G.T. Nilsen H. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Neuberger M.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that in mice deficient in uracil DNA glycosylase, there is a highly altered pattern of mutation in Ig genes that points to uracil in the DNA of Ig V regions as an intermediate product of the SHM reaction. Because cytosine deamination produces uracil, these data strongly suggest that the substrate of AID is the DNA of Ig V and switch regions. Although AID likely deaminates cytosine in the DNA of Ig V and switch regions, it cannot deaminate cytosine in double-stranded DNA. Instead, in vitro deamination by AID can be accomplished with single-stranded DNA or with double-stranded DNA undergoing transcription, suggesting that accessibility of DNA-cytosine residues to AID is hindered in duplex DNA (9Bransteitter R.

The lack of strand bias at G:C mutations in Ig V genes (24Fugmann S.D. Schatz D.G. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 429-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), 2M. Diaz and I. B. Rogozin, unpublished data. in particular the equally altered G and C mutation pattern in the absence of uracil DNA glycosylase (8Rada C. Williams G.T. Nilsen H. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Neuberger M.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), argues that AID has equal access to both strands, a scenario that appears unlikely with a transcription-mediated process. Thus, although a direct role for transcription-mediated AID deamination appears likely in CSR, it is difficult to reconcile a direct role for transcription in SHM with the absence of mutational strand bias at G:C base pairs. With the exception of the BCL6 gene in humans, SHM in hypermutating B cells is targeted to Ig V regions (25Shen H.M. Peters A. Baron B. Zhu X. Storb U. Science. 1998; 280: 1750-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, ectopic expression of AID in non-lymphoid tissues and in Escherichia coli leads to accumulation of mutations at G:C base pairs in non-Ig genes (26Yoshikawa K. Okazaki I.M. Eto T. Kinoshita K. Muramatsu M. Nagaoka H. Honjo T. Science. 2002; 296: 2033-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 27Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Harris R.S. Neuberger M.S.

Kinoshita K. Honjo T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1173-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and in humans, certain subsets of germinal center-derived B cell lymphomas display untargeted AID-mediated hypermutation in multiple protooncogenes such as C-MYC and PAX5 (29Pasqualucci L.

Therefore, when expressed outside of the context of targeted SHM in germinal center B cells, AID can act alone as a general mutator of G:C bases. These data suggest that although AID may have a preference for local DNA sequence (31Rogozin I.B. Diaz M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3382-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 32Yu K. Huang F.T. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6496-6500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 33Beale R.C. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Watt I.N. Harris R.S. Rada C. Neuberger M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), it requires cofactors for its proper targeting to the Ig V and switch regions. Furthermore, the data suggest that in the absence of cofactors, expression of AID leads to generalized mutagenesis and perhaps neoplasia. The existence of these cofactors and their identification remain the subject of intense investigation. Given its properties as a general mutator of G:C base pairs, we wondered whether AID is actively kept away from DNA by a nuclear export mechanism and then specifically transported back into the nucleus by targeting cofactors. AID has a molecular weight of 24,000 and thus would be expected to diffuse passively through the nuclear membrane because the upper threshold of the nuclear pore in eukaryotic cells is ∼50 kDa (34Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In searching for evidence of nuclear traffic regulation of AID, we aligned the AID amino acid sequences of various species and identified a highly conserved putative nuclear export sequence (NES). NES regions in proteins are binding sites for the exportin CRM1 (34Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). This ubiquitous mechanism of nuclear export is commonly associated with molecules of small size that function in the cytoplasm or with molecules whose entry into the nucleus must be regulated, such as transcription factors that translocate to the nucleus when activated (34Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In addition, we detected by proteomic analysis putative nuclear localization signals (NLS) in human AID, but not in mouse or chicken AID. Indeed, when we tested various human AID constructs that lacked either the putative NES or NLS, we found strong evidence that the NES sequence in the AID C terminus is active via a CRM1-mediated export mechanism. However, the putative NLS appears to be non-functional. We also examined the impact of DNA-damaging agents on nuclear retention of AID. We reasoned that if AID has affinity to DNA breaks, exposing transfected cells to DNA-damaging agents would result in the accumulation of AID in the nucleus. Strikingly, we found significant retention of AID in the nucleus following exposure to bleomycin, ionizing radiation, and hydrogen peroxide but not to UVC radiation, the only agent in the group that did not induce DNA breaks. Together, these results suggest that AID passively diffuses into the nucleus but that it is actively transported out of the nucleus by an NES-mediated mechanism. These results also suggest that in the presence of DNA damage, AID accumulates in the nucleus by binding to DNA single-(SSBs) or double-strand breaks (DSBs) either directly or indirectly through the ensuing DNA repair process. Cell Culture—293 fibroblast cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C in minimum Eagle's medium (MEM). The medium was supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% horse serum, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, 10,000 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml amphotericin (Invitrogen). Plasmid Constructs—Human AID cDNA was subcloned into the pD-sRED2-N1 vector (Clontech, BD Biosciences; Palo Alto, CA) using the EcoRI, BamHI, and KpnI sites in the vector. In this vector, the multiple cloning site is upstream of the DSRed gene, resulting in a recombinant protein that consists of AID with the red fluorescent protein fused to the C terminus. Consensus Kozac translation start sequences were placed upstream of the AID-encoding region in all of the constructs. Each construct was generated by PCR amplification using the primer sets described below, which result in deletion of the putative NLS (N-truncated), the putative NES (C-truncated), or the full-length AID (Wild type). The primer sequences were the following: Wild Type 1 (5′-cgcgaattccgccaccatggacagcctcttgatgaaccggaggaagt-3′) and Wild Type 2 (5′-cctggatccctagactcgagaagtcccaaagtacgaaatgc-3′), N-truncated 1 (5′-gctggtaccgccgccaccatggcctacctgtgctacgtagtgaagaggcgt-3′) and N-truncated 2 (5′-agcggatccgcaagtcccaaagtacgaaatgcgtctcg-3′), and C-truncated 1 (5′-gctggtaccgccgccaccatggacagcctcttgatgaaccggagga-3′) and C-truncated 2 (5′-agcggatccagacgaactgaattttcatgcagccct-3′). The NLS-deleted and the NES-deleted proteins had truncations of 29 amino acids in the N terminus and the C terminus, respectively. The clones were sequence-verified with DsRed2-N and -C primers (Clontech, BD Biosciences) using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator version 1.1 cycle-sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Transfection of 293 Cells and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were seeded/grown in sterile 2-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Exponentially growing cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) using the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 2 μg of appropriate eukaryotic expression vector and 3 μl of FuGENE 6 were mixed, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and applied directly to cells growing in the chambered coverglass for 6 h. 48 h after transfection, the following agents were added directly to the medium: 1) bleomycin (Sigma) (200 μg/ml) for 1 h, 2) hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) (50 and 100 μm) for 30 min, 3) 10 grays γ-rays, and 4) UVC radiation (100 J/m2, 254 nm, a dose predicted to yield 1 pyrimidine dimer/kb). Following treatments, cells were either fixed immediately or allowed to recover in complete medium (for 30 min in the case of hydrogen peroxide and 1 h for ionizing radiation). For the nuclear export experiments, cells were treated with leptomycin B (Calbiochem) at 50 ng/ml for 6 h before fixation and staining. All slides were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min, the DNA stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20 min, and washed twice with PBS. A laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 mounted on an Axiovert 200M microscope, Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was used to obtain the fluorescence images. The objective lens was the PlanApo 63×/1.4 Oil DIC, and the pinhole was set to achieve a z-resolution of 1.0 μm. For red fluorescence, the 543-nm line from the included HeNe laser was used for excitation, and a 560-nm long pass filter was used for the emission. For DAPI fluorescence, the 361-nm line from the included Coherent Ar laser was used for excitation, and a 435–485-nm band-pass filter was used for emission. Photographs were taken from each field of vision where at least 2–3 transfected cells could be viewed, and a single experiment was ended when either 50 transfected cells were counted or 15 fields were acquired. All treatments/transfections were done in at least two separate experiments. Flow Cytometry—The H2A.X phosphorylation assay (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake Placid, NY) was performed per the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, exponentially growing cells were treated with bleomycin, hydrogen peroxide, γ-rays, or UVC as done for the confocal studies. Cells were harvested, washed twice with 1× PBS, and fixed (37% formaldehyde in 10–15% methanol) on ice for 20 min to stop any DNA repair. Washed cells were incubated with antiphosphohistone H2A.X-FITC conjugate antibody in the presence of permeabilization solution (5% saponin, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.4 m NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2) on ice for 20 min with occasional gentle agitation. After washing once with PBS, cells were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSort. Comet Assay—The comet assay was a modified version of that described by Singh et al. (35Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (9058) Google Scholar). Briefly, following exposure to DNA-damaging agents under the same conditions as done for the confocal studies, cells were suspended in 100 μl of 1% (w/v) low melting point agarose in PBS, pH 7.4, at 37 °C and immediately pipetted onto a frosted microscope slide that had been precoated with 1% (w/v) normal melting point agarose. Slides were cooled at 4 °C for ∼10 min before a second layer of 100 μl of low melting point agarose was placed on top of the previous layer. After cooling the slides as above, they were immersed in lysis solution (2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm Tris, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, NaOH to pH 10.0) at 4 °C overnight. After they were neutralized for 5 min in 0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, slides were subjected to electrophoresis in a horizontal tank containing 0.3 m NaOH and 1 mm Na2EDTA at pH 13 for 20 min to unwind DNA before electrophoresis at 25 V constant for 40 min. The slides were rinsed three times for 5 min each with 0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, placed in cold ethanol for a minimum of 30 min, dried, and stained with 20 μg/ml ethidium bromide. A total of 25 comets/slide were scored for amount of DNA damage using the Komet 5.0 software (Kinetic Imaging Ltd., Liverpool, UK). Each treatment was done in duplicates. Statistical and Proteomic Analysis—Putative NLS and NES motifs were detected utilizing the PSORT II for eukaryotic sequences or NES Finder programs, respectively, available at psort.nibb.ac.jp (36Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar) and www.nki.nl/nkidep/h4/maarten/NES-Finder.htm. Chi-square tests were used to compare the fraction of cells with a particular subcellular distribution given various treatments/genetic constructs. The α-level for each set of comparisons was adjusted by the Bonferroni method (37Miller R.G. Simultaneous Statistical Inference, 2nd Ed. Springer Verlag, New York1981: 6-8Google Scholar) to p = 0.0127 to account for increased probability of type 1 errors by multiple comparisons. AID Is Actively Transported out of the Nucleus by a CRM1-mediated Mechanism—A putative NLS in the N terminus and NES in the C terminus of human AID were detected by proteomic programs. To investigate their functionality, we aligned the amino acid sequence of AID across several species and found that although the critical residues associated with the NES were highly conserved, the NLS sequence is only detectable in human AID (Fig. 1) by the PSORT II program. We generated various genetic constructs wherein wild type AID, AID lacking the putative NLS, and AID lacking the putative NES were fused to red fluorescent protein (RFP). We then visualized by confocal microscopy the intracellular locations of the various versions of the AID protein in transiently transfected fibroblast cells (Figs. 2 and 3). While 87% of the cells transfected with wild type AID displayed a cytoplasmic distribution of the fusion protein, 90% of the cells transfected with the NES-lacking AID construct displayed either a diffuse or nuclear distribution, with the majority of the cells having the AID protein in the nucleus (Fig. 2, a and c, and Fig. 3). These results imply that AID is actively shuttled out of the nucleus via its NES.Fig. 2Visualization of intracellular localization of the AID protein. AID (red) was fused to RFP, while DAPI (blue) stains the nuclear DNA. The majority of the cells transfected with wild type AID (a) localized to the cytoplasm, while cells transfected with NLS-lacking AID (b) displayed a diffuse pattern. The majority of cells transfected with NES-lacking AID (c) displayed a strictly nuclear distribution of AID.

The prediction is that if the NLS is important for AID entry into the nucleus, its removal would result in the disappearance of the class seen in cells transfected with the wild type AID that displayed a diffuse pattern (∼13% of wild type cells). Instead, this class of cells increased to a majority with the removal of the putative NLS. These results not only argue against a functional NLS in the N terminus but also raise the possibility that the resulting reduction in size of the fusion protein from the truncation in the N terminus (from ∼50 to ∼46 kDa) dropped the molecular weight below the threshold for size exclusion, significantly improving passive diffusion through the nuclear membrane of the fusion protein. Various reports place the size limit for passive diffusion at 50 kDa with a gray area between 40 and 50 kDa (34Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The NES-lacking construct was designed to be the same size as the NLS-lacking construct. However, the distribution of the NES-lacking construct was significantly different from the NLS-lacking protein; namely, the majority of the cells displayed a strictly nuclear distribution (Figs. 2c and 3, p < 0.001). To further confirm that the nuclear distribution of AID lacking the NES was the result of its NES region, we treated cells transfected with the full-length AID-RFP fusion with leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of the CRM1 exportin, the molecule most frequently associated with NES-mediated nuclear export. Indeed, nearly 50% of the cells treated with leptomycin B displayed either a diffuse pattern or a nuclear distribution of the AID-RFP molecules (Fig. 2d), a distribution that is significantly different from untreated cells transfected with the same length construct (Fig. 3). Together, these results demonstrate that the highly conserved NES in the C terminus of AID is indeed functional through a CRM1-mediated mechanism, whereas the poorly conserved NLS is most likely not functional. These results also suggest that the small AID molecule is able to passively diffuse through the nuclear pore but is then shuttled out of the nucleus primarily by the CRM1 exportin. DNA Damage-inducing Agents Caused Significant Retention of AID Molecules in the Nucleus—The above results strongly suggest that AID transiently moves into the nucleus via passive diffusion but is actively shuttled out by exportins. Given this finding, we wondered whether this process of export could be interrupted if AID binds another molecule such as DNA in the nucleus prior to being exported. Given recent findings that DNA breaks are associated with the IgV regions of hypermutating cells (16Sale J.E. Neuberger M.S.

Therefore, we treated fibroblasts transfected with full-length AID with the DNA-damaging agents bleomycin, hydrogen peroxide, ionizing radiation (γ-rays), or UVC radiation and visualized the intracellular location of the AID-RFP molecule by confocal microscopy. Bleomycin and γ-rays produce DNA breaks, particularly DSBs; hydrogen peroxide produces base damage, DSBs, and SSBs; and UVC is primarily associated with pyrimidine dimers (38Gabelova A. Slamenova D.

A sizeable fraction of the transfected cells treated with bleomycin, hydrogen peroxide, or ionizing radiation displayed significant nuclear retention of AID. Various confocal views of the cells treated with these agents are depicted in Fig. 4. We noticed that among the cells with nuclear retention of AID, the distribution of AID in the nucleus varied; some cells displayed discrete AID foci (less than 5% of the cells with retention, Fig. 4, b and d), a patch AID distribution that was confined to a particular region of the nucleus (∼35% of cells, Fig. 4a), or a diffuse pattern throughout the nucleus (∼60% of the cells, Fig. 4c). The fraction of cells retaining AID in the nucleus after treatment with bleomycin, hydrogen peroxide, or ionizing radiation was significantly higher than in untreated cells, particularly in the case of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 5). However, treatment of cells with UVC did not result in a significantly higher fraction of cells with nuclear retention of AID (Fig. 5).Fig. 5A significant fraction of the cells treated with bleomycin, γ-rays, and hydrogen peroxide but not UVC radiation displayed AID retention in the nucleus.Asterisks depict significant differences from untreated cells.

Previous studies have implicated endoglin in the inhibition of cell migration in vivo and in vitro. In the course of studies to address the relationship of the conserved cytosolic domain to endoglin function, we identified zyxin, a LIM domain protein that is concentrated at focal adhesions, as an interactor with endoglin in human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells. This interaction is localized within the 47-amino acid carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain of endoglin, and maps within zyxin residues 326–572. The endoglin-zyxin interaction was found to be largely mediated by the third LIM domain of zyxin, and is specific for endoglin because the homologous cytosolic domain of the transforming growth factor-β type III receptor, betaglycan, fails to interact with zyxin. Expression of endoglin is associated with reduction of zyxin, as well as its interacting proteins p130cas and CrkII, from a focal adhesion protein fraction, and this reduction is correlated with inhibition of cell migration. We also show that endoglin-dependent: (i) inhibition of cell migration, (ii) reduction of focal adhesion-associated p130cas/CrkII protein levels, (iii) tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas, and (iv) focal adhesion-associated endoglin levels are mediated by the cytosolic domain of endoglin. These results suggest a novel mechanism of endoglin function involving its interaction with LIM domain-containing proteins, and associated adapter proteins, affecting sites of focal adhesion.

Arteriovenous malformations occur in ∼20% of patients and are associated with life-threatening complications including stroke and brain abscess. Pathological features found in HHT telangiectases include focal dilatation of postcapillary venules and a prominence of actin stress fibers in pericytes (4Jacobson B.S. Am. J.

Mice lacking endoglin die from defective angiogenesis characterized by failure of vascular smooth muscle investment of embryonic blood vessels, suggesting a defect in vascular smooth muscle cell development (7Li D.Y.

The molecular mechanism underlying the angiogenic phenotype in the endoglin null mouse remains unclear. In vivo data points to a role for endoglin in the vascular response to injury. Findings from this laboratory showed that endoglin was expressed in human aortic smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic plaques but was absent from normal smooth muscle (8Conley B.S. Smith J.D.

However, following angioplasty, endoglin was present on adventitial myofibroblasts and medial smooth muscle cells of porcine coronary arteries. These workers also found that antisense oligonucleotides to endoglin decreased its expression and antagonized the TGF-β-mediated inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration in vitro, suggesting that endoglin may be required for modulation of smooth muscle cell migration by TGF-β. In addition, overexpression of endoglin in fibroblasts (10Guerrero-Esteo M. Lastres P. Letamendia A. Perez-Alvarez M.J. Langa C. Lopez L.A. Fabra A. Garcia-Pardo A. Vera S. Letarte M. Bernabeu C.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8272-8281Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) leads to an inhibition of cellular migration. These studies implicate endoglin in the control of cell migration within the context of the injured vessel wall and in embryonic development, although no molecular mechanism has been proposed to link endoglin expression to cell migration. The two known TGF-β type III receptors, endoglin and betaglycan, are auxiliary components of the TGF-β receptor system that associate with the types I and II signaling receptors and modulate the cellular responses to TGF-β (12Cheifetz S.

The cytosolic domains (CDs) of betaglycan and endoglin comprise 46 and 48 amino acid residues, respectively, are very similar bearing 71% homology at the protein level (12Cheifetz S. Bellon T. Cales C. Vera S. Bernabeu C. Massague J. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19027-19030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and are highly conserved between mammalian species. Whereas the CDs of endoglin and betaglycan are both serine- and threonine-rich, and to similar extents (S+T, 40%), the distributions of serine and threonine in the two CDs are quite distinct. The serine residues in the endoglin CD are more centrally clustered, whereas serine clustering in the betaglycan CD is more COOH-terminal. Despite these differences, potential similarities also exist. It has been suggested that the carboxyl-terminal three amino acids of endoglin (15Lux A. Gallione C.J. Marchuk D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and betaglycan (16Blobe G.C. Liu X. Fang S.J. How T. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39608-39617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) resemble sequences that may bind class 1 PDZ domains. To date, proteins, other than the TGF-β-receptors, that interact with endoglin and which could provide insight into the role of endoglin in vascular disease, vessel remodeling, and angiogenesis, have not been described. This paper is the first to examine the interaction of the LIM-domain protein zyxin, with endoglin, and describes functional consequences of endoglin expression including coordinate changes in the composition of sites of focal adhesion and cellular migration. Plasmids and Retroviral Constructs—The CD of endoglin was amplified with primers designed to encompass amino acids 612–658 of human endoglin: 5′-AAGAATTCTACATCTACTCGCACACCCGT and 5′-CGGGATCCTATGCCATG-CTGCTGGTGGA, and cloned into pAS-2-1 (Clontech). The CD of endoglin was subcloned into pGEX4T3 (Amersham Biosciences). The CD of betaglycan was amplified with primers designed to encompass amino acids 805–849 of human betaglycan: 5′-GCTCGAGCTACATCTATTCTCACACA and 5′-CTAGGGCCGTGCTGCTGCTGGA, and cloned into pGEX4T3. Zyxin constructs were amplified with the primers listed below and cloned into pMALC2 (New England Biolabs), engineered to contain an HA epitope between maltose-binding protein and the zyxin fragments. The zyxin forward primer (5′-GGAATTCCCATGGCGGCCCCCCGC) was designed to amplify beginning at amino acid 328 of the human zyxin cDNA. The zyxin reverse primers were as follows: LIM1, to amplify to amino acid 438: 5′-TCAAGTGTAACAGCCCTCGCA; LIM2, to amplify to amino acid 499: 5′-TCACTGCTTGTGGTAGTCGGG; and LIM3, to amplify to amino acid 572: 5′-TCAGGTCTGGGCTCTAGC. Human endoglin cDNA from pcEXVEndoL (17Bellon T. Corbi A. Lastres P. Cales C. Cebrian M. Vera S. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Letarte M. Bernabeu C. Eur. J.

Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar). pWZL is based on the pBABE retrovirus (19Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar), which uses an internal ribosomal entry site to drive hygromycin resistance. The -ΔC mutant of endoglin, lacking the cytosolic domain, and the -ΔSMA deletion mutant, lacking the 3 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues, were constructed by creation of termination codons immediately after amino acid residues 611 or 655, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™, Stratagene), and subsequently cloned into the pWZL retrovirus. Human zyxin cDNA was obtained in Bluescript from ATCC (clone number 1016104), and was subcloned into pcDNA 3.1, pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) engineered to contain an HA epitope upstream of zyxin. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Yeast Two-hybrid Construction and Screening—The Matchmaker Two-hybrid system 2 (Clontech) was used to isolate proteins that physically interact with the cytosolic domain of endoglin. pAS2-END-CD was transfected into yeast and used to screen a human lung cDNA library constructed in the GAL-4 AD vector, pACT2 (Clontech). Potential protein interactions between the DNA-BD/endoglin and the AD/lung library proteins were identified by cotransfecting both constructs into yeast (CG-1945) followed by determination of their ability to grow on medium lacking histidine. Interactions in His+ clones were confirmed by assaying for β-galactosidase activity. The identities of the potential proteins that interact with the endoglin CD were determined by DNA sequence analysis. GST Binding Analysis—Zyxin in pcDNA3.1 was transcribed and translated in vitro in the reticulocyte lysate programmed with T7 polymerase (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. For binding assays, GST-CD fusion proteins or GST alone (1.5–5 μg) were incubated with radiolabeled zyxin in 200 μl of GST binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm ZnCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2). After washing with binding buffer, proteins were eluted in SDS gel loading buffer (0.2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and separated by SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using a phosphorimager (Typhoon 8600, Amersham Biosciences) following exposure of the fixed dried gel to phosphorscreens for 1 h. Bands corresponding to zyxin were quantified using ImageQuant software version 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences). For GST pull down reactions from cells, GST-protein-containing bacterial lysates were diluted in GST binding buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and added to human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cell lysates obtained as described below. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) and immunoblotted using the indicated antibodies. Cell Lines and Transfections—Mouse C3H10T1/2, HEK 293, and BOSC23 (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GM7372 (ATCC) bovine endothelial cells were propagated in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Retrovirally transduced C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). The GM7372-EL, BOSC23, and HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected using the Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HUVEC were grown as previously described (21Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) for no more than 15 to 21 passages at a split ratio of 1:5 on a human fibronectin matrix, prepared as previously described (22Maciag T. Hoover G.A. Stemerman M.B. Weinstein R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), in Medium 199 supplemented with 10% FBS and supplemented with endothelial growth factor BulletKit (Clonetics). Construction of Tetracycline-inducible Cells—GM7372 cells were used to prepare stable Tet-responsive cell lines expressing the VP16Tet activator protein. Cells were transfected with the pTet-On vector (Clontech) followed by selection with G418 according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Isolated tetracycline-resistant clones were expanded and tested for inducibility by transient transfection with the pTRE-luciferase vector followed by assay for luciferase activity in the presence or absence of doxycycline (Sigma, 1 μg/ml). Doxycycline-responsive GM7372 clones were used for subsequent transfection with endoglin-containing Tet-responder plasmids. GM7372 Tet-responder cells transfected with the pBI-endoglin construct were selected using hygromycin-B. Clones were expanded and tested for Tet-dependent induction of endoglin by Western blotting. Doxycycline-inducible endoglin expressing clones (GM7372-EL) were further subjected to Western blotting to estimate endoglin levels at maximal induction (1 μg/ml doxycycline) and the doxycycline dose dependence of induction (data not shown). Construction of Retroviral-transduced Cell Lines—Subconfluent BOSC23 cells (20Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected with either control pWZL, or pWZL bearing -FL, -ΔC, or -ΔSMA endoglin constructs. The transfection medium was changed 16–24 h later, and virus was harvested 48 h post-transfection, filtered through 0.4-μm low protein binding filters (Millipore Inc.), and used immediately or stored at -70 °C. C3H10T1/2 cells were plated at 50% confluency in 6-well culture dishes, and the following day the medium was removed and replaced with 1.5 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS, 0.5–1.0 ml of the retrovirus preparation, and 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Following incubation with virus for 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS and 400 μg/ml hygromycin-B. Selection and expansion over the course of 10–14 days yielded a pooled polyclonal cell population. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to confirm the efficiency of retroviral gene expression, which was found to be greater than 95% in all cases (data not shown). Antibodies, Western Blot, and Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis— Anti-GST antibody was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-HA, anti-vinculin, anti-zyxin (goat, C19, and rabbit, H-200), anti-EGFP, and anti-p130cas antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Inc. Anti-endoglin P4A4 monoclonal antibody was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (NICHD, National Institutes of Health). Anti-endoglin monoclonal clone 35, and anti-CrkII antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) antibody was obtained from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine peroxidase-labeled antibody (RC20:PO) was obtained from BD Biosciences. Primary antibodies were used at the dilutions recommended by the manufacturer in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat dry milk. The phosphotyrosine antibody conjugate RC20:PO was used in TBST containing 5% BSA. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies were visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For Western blot analysis, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed three times with PBS, and lysed in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For co-immunoprecipitation studies cell culture plates were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysates were prepared using a modified radioimmunoprecipitation analysis (RIPA) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 μm EDTA, 100 μm EGTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture Set II, Calbiochem). Analysis of p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation was conducted essentially as previously described (23Kim J.T. Joo C.K. J. Biol.

Following three washes with serum-free DMEM, cells were either harvested (untreated) or stimulated with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) for 10 min. Culture plates were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 μm EDTA, 100 μm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and aliquots of cleared cell lysates containing the same amount of protein were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Protein A/G Plus-Sepharose (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS gel loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) and immunoblotted using the indicated antibodies. Quantitation of bound peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody and peroxidase-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, RC20:PO, was accomplished by phosphorimager analysis of ECL chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were seeded on 25-mm fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (BioCoat, BD Biosciences) and grown to 50–70% confluency. Cells were transfected with EGFP-zyxin, and either empty vector or pcDNA containing -FL or -ΔC endoglin. Following an additional incubation for 48 h, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 8 min. Coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated in blocking solution (5% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Primary anti-human endoglin antibody (SN6h, Dako), diluted 1:200 in blocking solution, was added to slides and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, and anti-mouse Cy3 conjugate, diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution, and incubated with the cells for 30 min. After a final 1× PBS wash, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Aquamount (Lerner Laboratories) and observed using the LTCS-SP confocal system with an inverted DMIRBE microscope using a ×100 objective (Leica). Affinity Purification of Focal Adhesion-associated Proteins—Tosyl-activated magnetic microspheres (4.5 μm diameter; Dynal) were coated with an RGD-containing peptide (Biomol) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were plated at high density (106 cells per 10-cm plastic culture dishes). Twenty-four hours later, cells were dispersed with trypsin-EDTA, washed twice in 1% BSA/DMEM, placed in polypropylene tubes (Costar), suspended (1 × 106 cells/ml) in BSA/DMEM containing magnetic RGD-labeled microspheres (2 × 107/ml), and rotated for 30 min at 37 °C. For experiments involving cytokine-dependent effects on focal adhesion proteins, TGF-β1 and activin A (R&D Systems) were used at 2 ng/ml. Microspheres and bound cells were isolated by magnetic collection and suspended in ice-cold cytoskeleton extraction buffer (CSK-EB, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes (25Plopper G. Ingber D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All subsequent procedures were carried out on ice. The magnetic bead pellet was transferred to freshly prepared complete CSK-EB (CSK-EB containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease and phosphatase mixtures), sonicated with 5 pulses (VWR Scientific, output setting, 1.3; duty cycle, 30) from a Branson sonifier. The microspheres were magnetically collected and washed 5 times with complete CSK-EB. Proteins in the bead complexes and total cell lysates (TCL) were dissolved in gel loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using an electroblotting system (Bio-Rad). Migration Assays—Cells were harvested by light trypsinization and washed twice in serum-free DMEM containing 200 μg/ml BSA and counted using a hemacytometer (AO Scientific Instruments). Final volumes were adjusted so that all cell preparations were at final concentrations of 106 cells/ml. Cells (40,000) were then added to the upper chamber of a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber (Neuro Probe) and allowed to migrate from 200 μg/ml BSA (upper chambers) to either 200 μg/ml BSA as a migration negative control, or DMEM containing FBS at the indicated concentrations. Following incubation for 5 h at 37 °C and at 5% CO2, migrating cells were fixed in 50% aqueous methanol for 5 min and then stained with PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Calbiochem). Migrating cells were quantitated by phosphorimager scanning of the cell-associated propidium iodide fluorescence. Scanning was conducted using a 532-nm excitation laser. Fluorescence was detected at 580 nm using a 30-nm band pass filter. Each measurement is the average of at least 6 microchemotaxis chamber wells. Zyxin Interacts with the Cytosolic Domain of Endoglin—In attempts to elucidate the function of endoglin by identifying proteins that interact with it, we screened a human lung cDNA library using the endoglin cytosolic domain as bait. Approximately 2 × 105 yeast transformants were screened, and His+ β-galactosidase+ clones were identified for further study. DNA sequence analysis identified the COOH-terminal region of the LIM domain-containing phosphoprotein, zyxin, corresponding to amino acid residues 326–572, as a potential interactor. In vitro affinity binding was used to characterize the specificity of the endoglin-zyxin interaction. Full-length zyxin in pcDNA3.1 was used to produce zyxin mRNA and 35S-labeled zyxin protein using the reticulocyte-coupled transcription-translation (TnT) system. Crude bacterial lysates containing the GST-endoglin CD or GST-betaglycan CD fusion proteins, or GST only, were incubated with the TnT lysate. A clear dose response of 35S-labeled zyxin protein bound to the GST affinity resin in terms of GST-endoglin CD added (Fig. 1A, histogram bars 2–4). The histogram bars corresponding to no added GST (bar 1), GST-betaglycan CD (bars 5–7), or empty GST vector (bars 8–10) produced only background binding. The inset panel in Fig. 1A shows the result of immunoblot analysis of constant volumes (5 μl) of GST proteins using anti-GST antibody to confirm equivalence of the protein levels corresponding to GST, endoglin-GST, and betaglycan-GST used in the binding reactions. These results indicate that the interaction of zyxin with the endoglin CD is markedly greater than with the betaglycan CD. GST pull down assay of transfected full-length zyxin (GFP-HA-zyxin) in pcDNA3.1 was conducted in HEK 293 cells using the GST-endoglin CD and betaglycan CD fusion proteins. HEK 293 cells were chosen for this experiment because they express negligible levels of endogenous zyxin by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Western blot analysis of the binding reactions confirms binding of zyxin by the GST-endoglin CD construct (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Interactions between zyxin and GST-betaglycan CD (lane 2) or GST alone (Lane 3) were not observed under these conditions. These results confirm the specificity of the interaction for the endoglin CD as compared with that of betaglycan. HUVEC were next used as a source of endogenous endoglin (26Gougos A. St. Jacques S.

Endoglin co-immunoprecipitated with zyxin, as shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1C, using an anti-zyxin antibody (immunoprecipitation, anti-zyxin; Western blot, anti-endoglin) thus confirming that the endoglin-zyxin interaction occurs between endogenous proteins in a primary endothelial cell. To further investigate the requirement of the cytosolic domain of endoglin for the interaction of endoglin with zyxin in intact cells, retrovirally infected C3H10T1/2 cells bearing full-length (-FL) endoglin and a carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant lacking the entire cytosolic domain (-ΔC) were constructed. In addition, we constructed a truncated endoglin mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal three amino acids because these residues have been proposed to constitute a PDZ liganding motif in betaglycan (-ΔSMA (15Lux A.

To explore the role of centrin in the protozoan parasite Leishmania, we created Leishmania deficient in the centrin gene (LdCEN). Remarkably, centrin null mutants (LdCEN(-/-)) showed selective growth arrest as axenic amastigotes but not as promastigotes. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the mutant axenic amastigotes have a cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M stage. The axenic amastigotes also showed failure of basal body duplication and failure of cytokinesis resulting in multinucleated cells. Increased terminal deoxy uridine triphosphate nick end labeling positivity was observed in centrin mutant axenic amastigotes compared with wild type cells, suggesting the activation of a programmed cell death pathway. Growth of LdCEN(-/-) amastigotes in infected macrophages in vitro was inhibited and also resulted in large multinucleated parasites. Normal basal body duplication and cell division in the LdCEN knockout promastigote is unique and surprising. Further, this is the first report where disruption of a centrin gene displays stage-specific/cell type-specific failure in cell division in a eukaryote. The centrin null mutant defective in amastigote growth could be useful as a vaccine candidate against leishmaniasis."

Arginine di-methylation, which is restricted to eukaryotic cells, occurs frequently in the context of RGG tripeptides (1Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Type I PRMTs account for the formation of asymmetric NG,NG-dimethylarginine, whereas type II enzymes catalyze the formation of symmetric NG,NG′-di-methylarginine. Five related enzymes that catalyze asymmetric arginine methylation have thus far been identified. The majority of Type I PRMT activity in eukaryotic cells appears to be accounted for by PRMT1 and its functional yeast homologue Hmt1/Rmt1 (3Tang J. Frankel A. Cook R.J. Kim S. Paik W.K.

Several recent studies have illustrated an important function of arginine methylation in the regulation of protein function. Methylation of Sam68, a proline-rich src-kinase substrate known to interact with WW or Src homology 3 domain containing signaling proteins, decreases its affinity for Src homology 3 domains but does not alter binding to WW motif-containing proteins (4Bedford M.T.

Similarly, arginine methylation of the STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) transcription factor decreases its affinity for its inhibitor PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1), thereby modulating interferon-induced gene transcription (5Mowen K.A.

A positive modulatory effect of arginine methylation on protein-protein interaction is observed with the Type II PRMT substrates SmD1 and SmD3, which require methylation for efficient binding to the spinal muscular atrophy gene product, SMN (6Brahms H.

Proteins within eukaryotic cells that shuttle across the nuclear envelope to facilitate proper cell function undergo nucleocytoplasmic transport by utilizing specific nuclear transport receptors, which ferry the cargo proteins through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). A signal sequence domain contained within the cargo proteins allows for the recognition of the protein by the transport receptor (8Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). The classical and by far most well characterized nuclear localization sequence (NLS), which consists of multiple basic amino acids including lysine and arginine residues, was originally identified in the SV40 large T antigen (9Goldfarb D.S. Gariepy J. Schoolnik G. Kornberg R.D. Nature. 1986; 322: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This NLS, which utilizes an importin α/β heterodimer as the import receptor, is both necessary and sufficient for protein transport across the NPC. During the import process, importin α binds the NLS-containing protein and serves as a link to importin β, which in turn interacts with the NPC. Recently, several proteins containing arginine-rich motifs within their NLS have been discovered that can bind to importin β independently of importin α (10Fagerlund R. Melen K. Kinnunen L.

RNA helicase A (RHA), whose nuclear import was previously thought to employ importin α and β, contains several arginine residues within its nuclear localization signal sequence. Mammalian RHA, also known as nuclear DNA helicase II, was first identified as a protein capable of unwinding double-stranded RNA as well as double stranded DNA sequences and has since been shown to fulfill multiple roles in mammalian cells (12Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16822-16830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhang S.S. Grosse F. J. Biol.

An additional function of RHA, which has similarity to yeast pre-mRNA splicing factors prp2, prp16, and prp22 (12Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

RHA has also been reported to increase retroviral RNA transcription by binding to the HIV trans-activation response elements (18Li J. Tang H. Mullen T.M. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W.

Additionally, RHA promotes the export of mRNA transcripts through binding to TAP and HAP95 (20Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 21Westberg C. Yang J.P. Tang H. Reddy T.R. Wong-Staal F. J. Biol.

Because of these multiple roles of RHA in the cell, it is important to elucidate the mechanism which governs the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of RHA. The C terminus of RHA contains a 110-amino acid bi-directional nuclear transport domain (NTD) that is necessary and sufficient for both nuclear import and export (24Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Heterokaryon analysis demonstrated that the RG/RGG-rich NTD confers bi-directional shuttling activity when linked to GST or other non-transport proteins, even though immunofluorescence studies revealed that the NTD confers a primarily nuclear steady-state localization onto the fusion protein. To date, phosphorylation is the only signal transduction mechanism shown to be involved in nuclear import. Since the NTD of RHA contains several RG/RGG motifs, we decided to investigate whether these residues are methylated by PRMT1 and whether the nuclear translocation of RHA is altered depending on its methylation state. Indeed we find that the NTD of RHA can be methylated by PRMT1 in vitro and that this methylation is necessary for NTD nuclear translocation. As such, our findings provide the first direct evidence that arginine methylation within a mammalian NLS regulates the function of the nuclear import signal. Tissue Culture and PRMT Inhibitors—U266 cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For microinjection experiments, HeLa cells were grown to 75% confluence on sterile cover slips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS at 37 °C. To inhibit PRMT activity cells were treated with 2 mm adenosine, 2 mm dl-homocysteine, and 2 mm N6-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine for 4 h at 37 °C. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of NTD Fusion Proteins—All RHA-NTD sequences were cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyrano-side for 4 h at 30 °C. GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with 20% glutathione (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl). In Vitro Arginine Methylation Assays—Reactions were carried out for 90 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 15 μg of substrate, 5 μg of GST-PRMT1, and 2 μlof S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (specific activity of 55.0 Ci/mmol). Reactions were stopped by adding SDS loading buffer. Proteins were subject to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk and soaking for 30 min in Amplify reagent (Amersham Biosciences), the blots were subjected to fluorography for 18 h at –80 °C on Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Arginine-methylated NTD for Microinjection—For these experiments, His-tagged PRMT1 was utilized instead of GST-PRMT1. Methylation reactions were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C and contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 150–200 μg of GST-NTD, 150–200 μg His-PRMT1 on nickel beads, and 72 μm S-adenosyl-l-methionine. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatants containing methylated GST-NTD were concentrated using a Centricon Y-10 filtration unit (Amicon) at 5000 × g to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. To determine efficiency of the methylation stochiometry, a parallel reaction was carried out as above, except radiolabeled S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine was used in place of non-radiolabeled SAM. Reactions were stopped by adding 800 μlof10% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μg of γ-globulins as carrier. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation the formic acid solubilized pellets were subjected to liquid scintillation counting in a Beckman LS-6500 scintillation counter. GST Pull-down Assays—U266 cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. GSH beads with 25 μg of “bait protein” were added to the cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer prior to addition of 50 μl of SDS loading buffer. Resolved proteins were probed for the presence of PRMT1 or RHA. To determine that the “bait” proteins were present in equal amounts, the blots were reprobed with GST antiserum. Microinjection Assays and Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were injected with the respective GST-NTD fusion proteins and rhodamine-conjugated dextran (Molecular Probes). Injections were performed at room temperature, and cells were returned to 37 °C after injection. After 1 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 10% FBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated with GST antisera followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies and fixed in mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole stain. RHA contains a 110-amino acid (position 1150–1259) bi-directional NTD that is necessary and sufficient for both nuclear import and export of the enzyme. This region harbors an NLS as well as a nuclear export sequence. Mutation or deletion of Lys-1162 causes the loss of RHA nuclear import, whereas deletion of amino acids 1221–1259 impairs the nuclear export of the protein (Fig. 1A). The “RGG” motifs found in the arginine-rich sequences of the NTD follow the consensus substrate recognition site for PRMTs (Fig. 1B). As PRMT1 accounts for the vast majority of PRMT activity in the cell, we decided to test whether the NTD can indeed function as a substrate for this enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2, PRMT1 is able to methylate GST fusion proteins of the full-length NTD (lane 1) as well as of both the ΔK62 and 508 deletion mutants (lanes 2 and 3, respectively), whereas GST alone was not methylated under these conditions (lane 4).Fig. 2PRMT1 interacts with full-length RHA and RHA-NTD. A, GST fusion proteins of full-length NTD, ΔK62, and 508 or GST alone were subject to in vitro methylation using recombinant PRMT1 (upper panel). The blot was probed with GST antisera to determine protein loading. B, wild-type and mutant GST-NTD fusion proteins were incubated with whole cell lysates and bound proteins probed for the presence of PRMT1 (upper panel). The blot was reprobed with GST antisera to determine the amounts of GST fusion proteins. C, whole cell lysates were incubated with GST-PRMT1 or GST alone and associated proteins probed for the presence of RHA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next wanted to determine whether the NTD can interact with endogenous PRMT1 in vivo. Using the GST-NTD fusion proteins as bait, we performed pull-down experiments in U266 whole cell lysates. As expected, PRMT1 associated with the GST-fusion proteins of the full-length NTD as well as the ΔK62 deletion mutant but not with GST alone. Intriguingly, PRMT1 also did not bind to the GST-508 fusion protein, even though this protein is methylated by PRMT1 in vitro (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 4, and 6). It thus appears that the C-terminal domain of the NTD, which harbors multiple RG/RGG motifs that are absent in the 508 truncation, may be crucial for the high affinity NTD/PRMT1 interaction required to sustain the association under the experimental conditions. To confirm the association of PRMT1 with RHA, we also performed pull-down experiments with GST-PRMT1 to test for its ability to associate with full-length endogenous RHA (Fig. 2C). Indeed, RHA bound to GST-PRMT1 but not to GST alone, supporting the concept of a physical interaction between these two proteins. The above experiments established that PRMT1 associates with RHA and is able to methylate full-length NTD as well as the ΔK62 and 508 deletion mutants in vitro. The localization of the RGG motifs suggested that methylation of the arginine within the NTD might exert a regulatory effect on the subcellular localization of RHA. To test this hypothesis, we performed microinjections of the full-length GST-NTD as well as the GST-ΔK62 and GST-508 deletion mutants, followed by immunofluorescence analysis with anti-GST antibodies. Previous studies had demonstrated that the GST-NTD fusion protein displays a nuclear steady-state localization despite its shuttling between cytoplasm and nucleus (24Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when full-length GST-NTD was injected into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells, it appeared in the nucleus in 100% of the injected cells (Fig 3A, top row). To determine whether arginine methylation would alter the subcellular localization of GST-NTD, we treated the cells with PRMT inhibitors prior to microinjection of the GST-NTD fusion protein. Incubation of cells with adenosine and dl-homocysteine in the presence of the S-adenosylhomocysteine-hydrolase inhibitor N-methyl-2-deoxyadenosine results in the cellular accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine, a potent inhibitor of PRMTs. We had previously found this regimen to be highly effective in abrogating the arginine methylation of the interferon activated transcription factor STAT1 (25Zhu W. Mustelin T. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35787-35790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). When these methylation inhibitors were added to cells prior to microinjection, more than 85% of the injected cells displayed a clear inhibition of nuclear import of the GST-NTD (Fig. 3A, bottom row). Importantly, when the truncated GST-508 fusion protein, which lacks several of the RGG motifs, was injected, it localized to the nucleus even in the presence of the methylation inhibitors (Fig. 3B). Together, these findings not only demonstrate that the RGG-motifs in the C terminus of the NTD, which are absent in GST-508, are not necessary for the nuclear localization but also argue that arginine methylation of its C-terminal region overcomes a negative effect exerted by this region on the nuclear import of the GST-NTD. One concern with the interpretation of the above experiments is the possibility that the abrogation of GST-NTD nuclear import by the PRMT inhibitors might not be due to blocking of the methylation of the NTD itself. Even though the fact that the nuclear translocation of the GST-508 is unaffected by the methylation inhibitor argues against this possibility, we could not exclude that the methylation inhibitors do not only target the methylation of the NTD but also that of additional cofactor(s) that might be required for its nuclear translocation. We therefore decided to subject the GST-NTD to in vitro arginine methylation by recombinant PRMT1 prior to microinjection of such arginine methylated fusion protein into untreated cells or into cells that had previously been exposed to the methylation inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3A, unmethylated GST-NTD is restricted to the cytoplasm when injected into cells treated with the methylation inhibitors. In contrast, when in vitro arginine-methylated GST-NTD is introduced into these cells, we found that the premethylated GST-NTD was still able to localize to the nucleus (Fig. 3C). These results clearly establish that the arginine methylation of the NTD itself is a crucial requirement for the nuclear import of the NTD fusion protein. The above results and those of additional nuclear and cytoplasmic microinjections are summarized in Table I. To exclude the possibility that our observations were an artifact of the isolated NTD, we performed heterokaryon assays with GFP-RHA(ApaI) as previously described (24Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T.J. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Exposure of the cells to methylation inhibitors prevented the movement between the nuclei as anticipated (data not shown).Table ISummary of microinjections of wild-type and mutant NTD fusion proteinsConstructInjectionDrugLocalizationNTDCytoNoNucNTDCytoYesCytoNTDNucNoNucNTDNucYesNucCH3-NTDCytoNoNucCH3-NTDCytoYesNucΔK62CytoNoCytoΔK62CytoYesCytoΔK62NucNoNucΔK62NucYesNuc508CytoNoNuc508CytoYesNuc508NucNoNuc508NucYesNuc Open table in a new tab The role of phosphorylation in the control of nuclear import in mammalian cells has been well documented; in contrast, a function for arginine methylation as a requirement for this process has not been previously reported. Precedence exists for a role of arginine methylation in cytoplasmic nuclear transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There, the RGG-rich domain of Npl 3p, when methylated by Hmt1/Rmt1, inhibits the phosphorylation of its NLS and its nuclear import. In a converse manner, arginine methylation is known to regulate the nuclear export of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins in yeast. Our results presented here provide the first evidence of arginine methylation-dependent nuclear import in mammalian cells. Consistent with a role for arginine methylation in NTD-mediated nuclear import, we find that the RHA-NTD can be methylated in vitro by PRMT1. Moreover, the NTD interacts with PRMT1 in GST pull-down assays, and conversely, GST-PRMT1 is able to bind endogenous RHA. Nuclear import mediated by the NTD of RHA is abrogated in the presence of inhibitors of PRMTs. This block of nuclear translocation can be overcome by in vitro methylating of the NTD prior to microinjection. Our studies summarized in Table I, however, do not provide any evidence for a role of arginine methylation in NTD-mediated nuclear export. Intriguingly, GST-508, created by removal of the RGG-rich C terminus of the NTD, is able to enter the nucleus even in the presence of inhibitors of arginine methylation. One potential explanation for the differential dependence of RHA-NTD and RHA-508 on arginine methylation for their nuclear localization might be the presence of an unidentified cytoplasmic “retention factor,” which binds to the unmethylated RGG-rich domain of the NTD and thereby prevents access of importin β to the NTD-NLS. Arginine methylation of the NTD causes the inhibitory protein to be released from RHA and thus allows for the exposure of the NLS, a process that is abrogated by inhibition of the methylation reaction. Removal of the RGG-rich C-terminal domain of the NTD eliminates the docking site for this putative inhibitor protein and allows nuclear import to proceed even in the presence of the PRMT inhibitors. This model is consistent with the finding that PRMT1 binds to GST-NTD but not to GST-508. In summary, we have shown that arginine methylation affects NTD-mediated nuclear import via an RGG-rich NLS; thus, it is likely that methylation affects the import of other proteins containing arginine-rich nuclear localization signals as well. As such, methylation may prove to be an important posttranslational modification of proteins requiring nuclear import/export for proper cellular function. We thank Dr. D. Forbes for discussions and support and C. Buckmaster and Dr. J. R. Feramisco for assistance with the microinjections."

Here we purified pleurotolysin, a novel sphingomyelin-specific two-component cytolysin from the basidiocarps of Pleurotus ostreatus and studied the pore-forming properties of the cytolysin. Pleurotolysin consisted of non-associated A (17 kDa) and B (59 kDa) components, which cooperatively caused leakage of potassium ions from human erythrocytes and swelling of the cells at nanomolar concentrations, leading to colloid-osmotic hemolysis. Hemolytic assays in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol)s with different hydrodynamic diameters suggested that pleurotolysin formed membrane pores with a functional diameter of 3.8–5 nm. Pleurotolysin-induced lysis of human erythrocytes was specifically inhibited by the addition of sphingomyelin-cholesterol liposomes to the extracellular space. Pleurotolysin A specifically bound to sphingomyelin-cholesterol liposomes and caused leakage of the internal carboxyfluorescein in concert with pleurotolysin B. Experiments including solubilization of pleurotolysin-treated erythrocytes with 2% (w/v) SDS at 25 °C and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/Western immunoblotting showed that pleurotolysin A and B bound to human erythrocytes in this sequence and assembled into an SDS-stable, 700-kDa complex. Ring-shaped structures with outer and inner diameters of 14 and 7 nm, respectively, were isolated from the solubilized erythrocyte membranes by a sucrose gradient centrifugation.

Pore-forming cytolytic proteins are distributed in a wide variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms (1Bernheimer A.W. Rudy B. Biochim. Biophys.

Complement, perforin from the cytotoxic T-cells, α-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus, streptolysin O from Streptococcus pyogenes, aerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila, and some others have been intensively studied in terms of pathophysiological functions (1Bernheimer A.W.

Several cytolytic proteins have been isolated from the basidiocarps of both toxic and edible mushrooms, and their pore-forming properties as well as cardiotoxicity and cytotoxicity were studied (5Faulstich H.

Although physiological function of the mushroom cytolysins remains enigmatic, recent studies implied the involvement of hemolytic proteins in the fruiting initiation of some mushrooms. The Aa-Pri1 gene encoding a 16-kDa putative protein has been shown to be specifically expressed in the fruiting initiation of the edible mushroom Agrocybe aegerita (10Fernandez Espinar M. Labarere J. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Berne S. Krizaj I. Pohleven F. Turk T. Macek P. Sepcic K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1570: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Aegerolysin, a 17-kDa hemolytic protein isolated from the basidiocarps of A. aegerita, has an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence with the predicted Aa-Pri1 protein, and it was detected only in the primordia and immature fruiting bodies of the mushroom (11Berne S. Krizaj I. Pohleven F. Turk T. Macek P. Sepcic K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1570: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Previously, Bernheimer and Avigad (12Bernheimer A. Avigad L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 585: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) isolated a 12-kDa cytolysin from the basidiocarps of Pleurotus ostreatus and designated it pleurotolysin. They show that pleurotolysin has unique characteristics such as sphingomyelin-specific hemolytic activity and an unusual amino acid composition with the lack of seven amino acids commonly found in proteins. Although we detected hemolytic activity in the homogenate of the mushroom, we failed to isolate the 12-kDa hemolysin. Instead, we found that the hemolytic activity of the mushroom homogenate was lost by a gel filtration using Sephadex G-75, but it was recovered to the original level when all of the fractions were recombined. In addition, hemolytic activity of the mushroom homogenate decreased to 10% of the original level at 4 °C within a day unless protease inhibitors were added. The results suggested that P. ostreatus hemolysin consists of multiple components, and the pleurotolysin of Bernheimer and Avigad (12Bernheimer A. Avigad L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 585: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) could be a proteolytic product. Recently, ostreolysin was isolated as a 16-kDa hemolysin from the basidiocarps of P. ostreatus, which was suggested to be specifically expressed in primordia and fruiting bodies of the mushroom (11Berne S. Krizaj I. Pohleven F. Turk T. Macek P. Sepcic K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1570: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast to the sphingomyelin-specific pleurotolysin described by Bernheimer and Avigad (12Bernheimer A. Avigad L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 585: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), ostreolysin is inhibited by a series of lysophospholipids but not inhibited by sphingomyelin (11Berne S. Krizaj I. Pohleven F.

In this study, we purified a novel sphingomyelin-specific cytolysin consisting of A (17 kDa) and B (59 kDa) components from the basidiocarps of P. ostreatus and designated it pleurotolysin (Ply) 1The abbreviations used are: Ply, pleurotolysin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250; CF, carboxyfluorescein; OD, optical density. because of its sphingomyelin specificity. We studied the interaction of the two-component cytolysin with mammalian erythrocytes and liposomes. Our results showed that Ply A and B bind to sphingomyelin-containing membranes in this sequence and assemble into a ring-shaped transmembrane pore with a functional diameter of 3.8–5.0 nm. Purification of Ply—All purification steps were carried out at 0–4 °C, except for high performance liquid chromatography, and Ply fractions were treated with protease inhibitors at each step. Human erythrocytes were used for hemolytic assay. Basidiocarps of P. ostreatus (1 kg, wet weight) were homogenized in 1 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 10 mm ethylenediamine tetraacetate. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 h, and ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 60% saturation. The precipitates obtained were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.3) and adsorbed onto a DEAE Cellulofine A-500 column (5 × 30 cm; Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan). Hemolytically active fractions, eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0–400 mm), were dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.3) and were adsorbed on to a hydroxylapatite column (2.5 × 20 cm; Seikagaku). Hemolytically active fractions, eluted with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate (10 to 100 mm, pH 7.3) with 600 mm KCl, were combined and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Ammonium sulfate was added to the hydroxylapatite fraction to 25% saturation and was adsorbed onto a phenyl Toyopearl 650M column (2 × 20 cm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Unadsorbed fractions were combined as the Ply A fraction and passed through a Toyopearl HW50S column (3 × 150 cm; Tosoh). Adsorbed proteins were eluted from the phenyl Toyopearl 650M column with a descending linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (25–0% saturation). Ply B fractions were combined and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Hemolytic activity of Ply A and B was assayed in the presence of their counterpart (final concentration, 1 μg/ml). The Ply B fraction was concentrated and electrofocused into two fractions using Immobiline gels (pH 6–8; Amersham Biosciences). The active fractions obtained were purified by two steps of column chromatography using a DEAE-5PW column (0.75 × 20 cm; Tosoh). Hemolytic Assay—Hemolytic assay was performed as described (8Tomita T. Ishikawa D. Noguchi T. Katayama E. Hashimoto Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes (3 × 107 cells/ml) were incubated with Ply at 25 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, the supernatants obtained were assayed for absorbance at 541 nm. 100% lysis was defined as the absorbance of the supernatants obtained from the osmotically lysed cells. Anti-Ply Sera—Antisera were raised in female New Zealand White rabbits as described (8Tomita T. Ishikawa D. Noguchi T. Katayama E. Hashimoto Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Purified Ply A was used for the preparation of anti-Ply A serum. To prepare antisera against Ply B and its 41-kDa fragment, the Ply B fraction from phenyl Toyopearl 650M column chromatography was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands corresponding to 59 and 41 kDa were cut off and used as antigens. Efflux of Intracellular Potassium—Washed human erythrocytes (∼6 × 108 cells/ml) were incubated with Ply A and B (final concentration of each component, 0.5 μg/ml) at 25 °C for 0–30 min. After centrifugation for 1 min at 5,000 × g, small portions of the supernatants were withdrawn for hemolytic assay. The rest of the supernatants were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min. Portions of the supernatants obtained were dried, decomposed at 550 °C, and dissolved in 20 mm HCl. Potassium ions were assayed using a Hitachi Z-8100 Polarized Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan). Functional Diameter of Membrane Pores—Ply-induced hemolysis was assayed at 25 °C in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol)s of different sizes. Poly(ethylene glycol)s were added at a concentration equivalent to 40 mosm to counterbalance the osmotic pressure of intracellular hemoglobins (14Freedman J.C. Hoffman J.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1979; 74: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and total osmotic pressure of the solutions was adjusted to 295 mosm. The hydrodynamic diameters of poly(ethylene glycol)s are from the reports of Scherrer and Gerhardt (15Scherrer R. Gerhardt P. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 718-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Sabirov et al. (16Sabirov R.Z. Krasilnikov O.V. Ternovsky V.I. Merziliak P.G. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1993; 12: 95-111PubMed Google Scholar) where the hydrodynamic diameters were calculated on the viscosity of poly(ethylene glycol) solutions. Binding of Ply to Liposomes and Liposome Lysis—Multilamellar liposomes were prepared from phospholipid and cholesterol as described (17Tomita T. Watanabe M. Yasuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13391-13397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The liposomes (0.1 μmol of lipids) were incubated with Ply A or B (10 μg of each) in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at 25 °C for 30 min. The liposomes were washed twice with TBS and were subjected to SDS-PAGE after treatment with 2% SDS at 100 °C for 5 min. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB). To assay liposome lysis, carboxyfluorescein (CF)-loaded liposomes (0.5 nmol of lipids in 50 μl) were incubated with Ply A and B at 25 °C for 30 min in a microplate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Fluorescence of the released CF was measured using a microplate reader MTP32 (Corona Electric, Katsuda, Japan). 100% CF release was defined as the fluorescence intensity obtained upon exposure to 0.5% Triton X-100. Assembly of Ply A and B into a High Molecular Weight Complex on Erythrocytes and Sphingomyelin-Cholesterol Liposomes—Erythrocytes (6 × 107 cells) were incubated with Ply A and B (5 and 0.5 μg of each for direct stain with CBB or for immunostain, respectively) in 1 ml of TBS at 25 °C for 30 min. The erythrocytes were collected by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2). The erythrocyte membranes were solubilized with 2% (w/v) SDS at 25 °C and were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a linear gradient gel of 3–22% (w/v) acrylamide followed by Western immunoblot using antisera against Ply A and B. Sphingomyelin-cholesterol liposomes (0.2 μmol of lipids) were incubated with Ply A and B (10 μg of each) at 25 °C for 30 min. The liposomes were collected and washed twice with TBS. The washed liposomes were solubilized with 2% (w/v) SDS at 37 °C for 10 min and were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot. Isolation of the High Molecular Weight Complex—Human erythrocytes (6 × 109 cells) were incubated with Ply A and B (500 μg of each) in 100 ml of TBS at 25 °C for 30 min. Erythrocyte membranes were collected and washed twice with 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2). The washed cell membranes were packed by centrifugation using a Beckman SW40Ti rotor at 36,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 h. The packed cell membranes were treated with 2% SDS (w/v) at 25 °C and loaded onto a 10–40% (w/w) sucrose gradient in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% SDS. Centrifugation was performed using a Beckman SW40Ti rotor at 32,000 rpm for 19 h at 4 °C. Thyloglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (480 kDa), and catalase (232 kDa) were used as molecular size markers. Electron Microscopy—Fractions containing the high molecular weight complexes were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 4 °C. The dialyzed samples were placed onto carbon-coated grids, washed briefly with 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and stained negatively with 1% (w/v) sodium phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.2). Specimens were examined under a Hitachi electron microscope H-8100 (Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. Miscellaneous—Protein concentration was assayed as described by Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was analyzed using an ABI model 491 protein sequencer (PE/Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (19Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Osmotic pressure of the poly(ethylene glycol) solutions was measured at 25 °C using a micro-osmometer, model 3MO (Advanced Instruments, Needham Heights, MA). Phosphorus was assayed as described (20Gerlach E. Deuticke B. Biochem. Z. 1963; 337: 477-479PubMed Google Scholar). Sphingomyelinase activity was assayed as described (21Wadstroem T. Moellby R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 242: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Materials and Chemicals—Basidiocarps of P. ostreatus were purchased from a farm and stored at –40 °C before use. Poly(ethylene glycol)s were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine was from Nippon Oil and Fats Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Bovine brain sphingomyelin, bovine brain phosphatidylserine, egg yolk phosphatidylglycerol, soybean phosphatidylinositol, and bovine cardiac muscle cardiolipin were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol (Sigma) was crystallized twice in methanol. CF was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and purified as described (22Ralston E. Hjelmeland L.M. Klausner R.D. Weinstein J.N. Blumental R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 649: 133-137Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Purification of a Novel Two-component Hemolysin from the Basidiocarps of P. ostreatus—The hemolytically active extract from the basidiocarps of P. ostreatus was fractionated by column chromatography using DEAE-Cellulofine A-500, hydroxylapatite, and a phenyl Toyopearl 650M column. The column chromatography using the phenyl Toyopearl 650M column separated the hemolytically active hydroxylapatite fraction into the unadsorbed Ply A and the adsorbed Ply B fractions (results not shown). Approximately 130 and 20 mg proteins were obtained in the A and B fractions, respectively, from the basidiocarps (1 kg, wet weight). The Ply A fraction was further purified by passing it through a Toyopearl HW50S column, and the A fraction thus obtained gave a single protein band corresponding to 17 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the B fraction obtained from the phenyl Toyopearl 650M column chromatography gave six major protein bands corresponding to 64, 59, 43, 41, 23, and 18 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). On the basis of the following results, we assumed that the 41- and 18-kDa proteins derived from the 59-kDa protein through a limited proteolysis. (i) High performance liquid chromatography using a DEAE-5PW column fractionated the B fraction into two Ply B peaks (Fig. 1B). The first Ply B peak gave a major protein band corresponding to 59 kDa, which was eluted in tandem with Ply B activity (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the second Ply B peak contained two major proteins of 41 and 18 kDa (Fig. 1B). (ii) Unless protease inhibitors were used at each purification step, the relative amount of the 59-kDa protein decreased in the B fraction, and relative amounts of the 41- and 18-kDa proteins increased (results not shown). To test this possibility, we raised specific antisera to the 59- and the 41-kDa proteins for Western immunoblot. Antiserum against the 59-kDa protein recognized all the protein bands corresponding to 59, 41, and 18 kDa, whereas antiserum against the 41-kDa protein reacted with the 59-kDa protein as well as the 41-kDa protein but not with the 18-kDa protein (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 59-, 41-, and 18-kDa proteins (i.e. Ser-Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Arg-Thr-Leu-Asn-Asp-Val-Ile-Gln-, Phe-Asp-Asp-Val-Ile-Lys-Leu-Ser-Pro-Gln-Phe-Thr-His-Gly-Val-Gln-Ala-Ala-Leu-Ala-Lys-, and Ala-Gly-Asp-Arg-Leu-Asn-Asp-Val-Ile-Gln-, respectively) indicated that the 59- and the 18-kDa proteins have identical N-terminal amino sequences, although the 18-kDa polypeptide has lost the first two amino acid residues. The results suggested that the 59-kDa protein is Ply B, and the 18- and 41-kDa proteins derived from the N- and C-terminal regions of the 59-kDa protein, respectively. To identify Ply B, we attempted to purify the 59-, 41-, and 18-kDa proteins. The Ply B fraction obtained from the phenyl Toyopearl 650M column chromatography was electrofocused into two fractions corresponding to pH 6.8 and 7.0 (Fig. 2A; fractions I and II, respectively). Fraction I contained a single major protein of 59 kDa and minor ones of 41 and 18 kDa, whereas fraction II contained the major proteins of 41 and 18 kDa and a minor one of 59 kDa (results not shown). Fraction I was adsorbed on to a DEAE-5PW column, and two Ply B peaks were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (Fig. 2B). The 59-kDa protein, which was eluted as the major protein in the first peak, was purified to homogeneity by the second DEAE-5PW column chromatography (Fig. 2, D and F, lane I). The 41- and 18-kDa proteins were purified from fraction II using two steps of DEAE-5PW column chromatography (Fig. 2, C, E, and F, lane II). The purified 59-kDa protein and the mixture of the 41- and the 18-kDa proteins caused 50% lysis of human erythrocytes at 17 and 58 ng/ml, respectively, in concert with Ply A (1 μg/ml). Both the 59-kDa protein and the mixture of the 41- and 18-kDa proteins gave single peaks of absorbance at 280 nm corresponding to 60 kDa on the gel filtration using a TSKgel G-3000SW column (results not shown). Therefore, the 59-kDa protein existed as a monomer in solution, and the polypeptides of 41- and 18-kDa were non-covalently associated with each other. Taken together with the results of the Western immunoblot (Fig. 1C) and the protein sequencing described above, the 59-kDa protein is Ply B, and Ply is the single hemolysin in the basidiocarps of P. ostreatus. To assess the optimal molar ratio of Ply A to B for induction of hemolysis, the mixtures of Ply A and B in various molar ratios were assayed for hemolytic activity toward human erythrocytes. Ply exhibited the maximal hemolytic activity when the A and B components were mixed in a molar ratio of 3 (Fig. 3A). On the basis of the results, Ply A and B of the same protein concentration were mixed and used in the following experiments (where molar ratio of Ply A to B was 3.5) unless otherwise stated. Ply A and B caused 50% hemolysis when each of the components was present at 50 ng/ml (i.e. 2.9 and 0.85 nm, respectively), whereas neither Ply A nor B induced significant hemolysis at higher concentrations of up to 80 μg/ml without their counterpart (Fig. 3B). The N-terminal 32 and 12 amino acid residues of Ply A and B were determined to be Ala-Tyr-Ala-Gln-Trp-Val-Ile-Ile-Ile-Ile-His-Asn-Val-Gly-Ser-Lys-Asp-Val-Lys-Ile-Lys-Asn-Leu-Lys-Pro-Ser-Trp-Gly-Lys-Leu-His-Ala- and Ser-Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Arg-Leu-Asn-Asp-Val-Ile-Gln-, respectively. A similarity search on the DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI nucleotide sequence data bases indicated that Ply B has no similar sequence with any other protein registered. In contrast, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of Ply A is identical with that of the P. ostreatus PriA protein (GenBank™ accession number AF331453-1), which is a predicted product from the nucleotide sequence of a mRNA from the mushroom. However, no information other than the nucleotide sequence is available for the P. ostreatus PriA protein. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of Ply A also exhibits 93 and 75% identity with those of P. ostreatus ostreolysin (GenBank™ accession number P83467) and A. aegerita Aa-Pri1 (GenBank™ accession number AF004297-1), respectively. Cooperative Pore-forming Activity of Ply—When human erythrocytes were exposed to Ply A and B at 25 °C, intact disc shaped erythrocytes became swollen round shaped cells with a clear edge within 2–3 min, and thereafter the swollen cells released hemoglobins (Fig. 4A–C). Because swelling of cells is generally caused by an increased permeability of cell membranes, we assayed Ply-induced leakage of potassium ions and hemoglobins from human erythrocytes. >90% of the intracellular potassium ions leaked within 3 min after the addition of Ply A and B, whereas the onset of hemolysis occurred after a 3-min or longer incubation time (Fig. 4D). No leakage of intracellular potassium ion and hemoglobin took place upon exposure to either Ply A or B alone (Fig. 4D). Ply-induced leakage of potassium ions and hemoglobins were also assayed in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) 6000. Although Ply A and B did not lyse human erythrocytes in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) 6000, >90% of the intracellular potassium ions leaked within 3 min (Fig. 4D). The Ply-treated erythrocytes were swollen but not lysed in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) 6000 (results not shown). The results suggested that Ply A and B cooperatively formed membrane pores to cause the colloidosmotic burst of human erythrocytes, and the functional diameter of the pore was smaller than the hydrated diameter of hemoglobin but larger than that of a potassium ion. To estimate the functional diameter of the pores, we assayed the Ply-induced lysis of human erythrocytes in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol)s with different hydrodynamic diameters. Ply-induced hemolysis was not significantly affected by the addition of poly(ethylene glycol)s 200–1000 (Fig. 5). In contrast, Ply-induced hemolysis was partially inhibited by poly-(ethylene glycol)s 2000, 3000, and 4000, and it was entirely suppressed by poly(ethylene glycol)s 6000, 8000, and 10,000 (Fig. 5). The hydrodynamic diameters of poly(ethylene glycol)s 4000 and 6000 were estimated to be 3.8 and 5.0 nm, respectively (15Scherrer R. Gerhardt P. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 718-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sabirov R.Z. Krasilnikov O.V. Ternovsky V.I. Merziliak P.G. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1993; 12: 95-111PubMed Google Scholar). Similar experiments using neutral sugars showed that Ply lysed human erythrocytes in the presence of dextran 4, but it caused no hemolysis in the presence of dextran 500 (results not shown; the hydrodynamic diameters of dextran 4 and 500 were estimated to be 3.5 nm and 28 nm, respectively) (15Scherrer R.

Biophys. 1993; 12: 95-111PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggested that Ply formed membrane pores with a functional diameter of 3.8–5.0 nm.Fig. 5Ply-induced lysis of human erythrocytes in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol)s of different molecular sizes. Human erythrocytes were incubated with Ply A and B at 25 °C for 30 min in the absence (•) or presence of poly(ethylene glycol) 200 (○), 600 (♦), 1000 (⋄), 2000 (▴), 3000 (▵), 4000 (▪), 6000 (□), 8000 (▾), or 10,000 (▿).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sphingomyelin-binding Activity of Ply A and Sphingomyelin-specific Hemolysis—Erythrocytes from various mammalian species exhibited different susceptibilities to Ply, and the concentrations of Ply A and B for inducing 50% hemolysis were estimated to be 7, 50, 120, 4800, and 14,000 ng/ml for the erythrocytes from sheep, human, rabbit, dog, and horse, respectively (Fig. 6A). The results are consistent with those of Bernheimer and Avigad (12Bernheimer A. Avigad L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 585: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the susceptibility of erythrocytes to Ply may correlate with sphingomyelin content of the cell membrane (23Rouser G. Nelson G.J. Fleischer S. Simon G. Chapman D. Biological Membranes Physical Fact and Function. Academic Press, New York1968: 5-69Google Scholar). To clarify what component of Ply differentiates the mammalian erythrocytes, we assayed the binding of Ply A and B to the cells. Ply A bound to the erythrocytes from sheep, human, and rabbit more efficiently than to those from dog and horse (Fig. 6B), whereas Ply B did not substantially bind to the mammalian erythrocytes (results not shown). The results suggested that Ply A determined the susceptibility of erythrocytes to Ply. To test the sphingomyelin specificity of Ply, we assayed the hemolytic activity of Ply in the presence of multilamellar liposomes composed of each of various phospholipids and cholesterol in a molar ratio of 1:1. Sphingomyelin-cholesterol liposomes inhibited Ply-induced hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner"

Repair mechanisms for chromium and other DNA phosphate-based adducts are currently unknown in human cells. We found that nucleotide excision repair (NER)-proficient human cells rapidly removed chromium-DNA adducts, with an average t½ of 7.1 h, whereas NER-deficient XP-A, XP-C, and XP-F cells were severely compromised in their ability to repair chromium-DNA lesions. Activation of NER in Cr(VI)-treated human fibroblasts or lung epithelial H460 cells was manifested by XPC-dependent binding of the XPA protein to the nuclear matrix, which was also observed in UV light-treated (but not oxidant-stressed) cells. Intracellular replication of chromium-modified plasmids demonstrated increased mutagenicity of binary Cr(III)-DNA and ternary cysteine-Cr(III)-DNA adducts in cells with inactive NER. NER deficiency created by the loss of XPA in fibroblasts or by knockdown of this protein by stable expression of small interfering RNA in H460 cells increased apoptosis and clonogenic death by Cr(VI), providing genetic evidence for the role of monofunctional chromium-DNA adducts in the toxic effects of this metal. The rate of NER of chromium-DNA adducts under saturating conditions was calculated to be ∼50,000 lesions/min/cell. Because chromium-DNA adducts cause only small changes in the DNA helix, rapid repair of these modifications in human cells indicates that the presence of major structural distortions in DNA is not required for the efficient detection of the damaged sites by NER proteins in vivo.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; CPDs, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA. is the major DNA repair mechanism responsible for the removal of UV light-induced DNA lesions and bulky DNA adducts generated by many chemical mutagens (1Wood R.D. Mitchell M. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. Science. 2001; 291: 1284-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 2Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Elimination of DNA damage by NER is a highly coordinated process consisting of recognition of the damaged site, excision of a short oligonucleotide containing the DNA lesion, and filling in of the repair-generated gap by a DNA polymerase, followed by ligation of the nick. In vitro reconstitution experiments with protein preparations from human cells have identified six core factors that are required for recognition and excision of bulky DNA modifications: XPA protein, XPC HR23B complex, replication protein A heterotrimer, multisubunit transcription factor IIH complex, and two structure-specific nucleases, XPG and XPF-ERCC1 (3Araujo S.J.

NER consists of two subpathways that specialize in the removal of DNA lesions from either the entire genome (global NER) or the transcribed strands (transcription-coupled NER) (2Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The difference in these two subpathways lies in the mechanisms of lesion detection. The initial damage recognition in global NER is usually performed by the XPC-HR23B complex (4Sugasawa K. Ng J.M. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7476-7485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which may require additional factors for sensing DNA modifications that cause relatively minor duplex distortions. For example, efficient global repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and recruitment of XPC are dependent on the presence of the UV-DDB (UV-damaged DNA-binding factor) protein complex (6Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 7Fitch M.E. Nakajima S. Yasui A. Ford J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46906-46910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In transcription-coupled NER, DNA lesions are detected by stalling of RNA polymerase II, followed by the recruitment of the NER core machinery with the help of three additional proteins, CSA, CSB, and XAB2 (2Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 8Nakatsu Y. Asahina H. Citterio E. Rademakers S. Vermeulen W. Kamiuchi S. Yeo J.-P. Khaw M.-C. Saijo M. Kodo N. Matsuda T.

The most common substrates for NER are bulky base lesions causing a major disruption of hydrogen bonding (2Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Smaller chemical modifications of DNA bases formed by oxidative damage and alkylating agents are usually repaired by the base excision repair process (2Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 9Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Although major caretakers of DNA bases are now known, the nature of human repair processes involved in preserving the integrity of the DNA phosphate backbone is not well understood. The DNA phosphate group is a frequent site of adduct formation by chemical carcinogens and chemotherapeutic drugs (10Singer B. Environ. Health Perspect. 1985; 62: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Maccubbin A.E. Caballes L. Riordan J.M. Huang D.H. Gurtoo H.L.

Alkylation of DNA phosphates generates alkylphosphotriesters that, in Escherichia coli, are repaired via a non-NER process involving the Ada protein (13McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2683-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ada homologs have not been found in human cells (1Wood R.D. Mitchell M. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. Science. 2001; 291: 1284-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 9Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), raising the question of whether DNA phosphate adducts could be substrates for NER, which has not yet been clearly addressed. Protein extracts from hamster cells have been found to excise only very small amounts of methylphosphotriester-containing oligonucleotides (14Branum M.E. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25421-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but this result could have reflected the inefficiency of the in vitro NER. However, persistence of DNA alkylphosphotriesters in human fibroblasts was reported to be independent of the NER status (15Bodell W.J. Singer B. Thomas G.H. Cleaver J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 2819-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although the employed analytical methodology was not very specific. In this work, we examined the role of cellular NER in the removal of DNA phosphate modifications by determining the intracellular persistence and biological activity of chromium-DNA adducts in human cells with normal and deficient NER. Various Cr(III)-DNA adducts are formed after intracellular uptake and reduction of Cr(VI), which is a recognized human carcinogen causing major environmental concerns and significant exposure in several dozens of occupations (16Zhitkovich A. Wilson S.H. Suk W.A. Biomarkers of Environmentally Associated Disease: Technologies, Concepts, and Perspectives. CRC Press LLC, New York2002: 267-285Google Scholar). The main forms of chromium-DNA adducts in mammalian cells are ternary complexes generated by cross-linking of cysteine and histidine to DNA via a phosphate-bound Cr(III) atom (17Zhitkovich A. Voitkun V. Costa M. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Quievryn G. Messer J. Zhitkovich A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3156-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All chromium-DNA adducts have been determined to be mutagenic in human cells (19Voitkun V. Zhitkovich A. Costa M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2024-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Zhitkovich A. Song Y. Quievryn G. Voitkun V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Quievryn G. Peterson E. Messer J. Zhitkovich A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We found that NER was a principal repair mechanism for chromium-DNA adducts in human cells, which establishes NER as the most comprehensive DNA repair system capable of removing damage from both the backbone and base components of the DNA structure. Rapid repair of weakly distorting chromium-DNA phosphate adducts indicates that the presence of major structural deformations in the DNA helix is not always necessary for the efficient recognition of DNA modifications by human NER. Cells—Human primary IMR90 fibroblasts and SV40-immortalized XP-A (XPA–, GM04312C) and XP-F (XPF–, GM08437B), XPA-complemented XP-A (XPA+, GM15876A), and repair-proficient (WT/SV, GM00637H) human fibroblasts were obtained from the Coriell Repository. Human lung epithelial H460 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Measurements of Chromium Adducts in Cellular DNA—Cells were treated with 1–5 μm K2CrO4 for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), supplemented with normal growth medium, and collected for the determination of chromium-DNA adducts at different times. Isolation of cellular DNA and measurements of DNA-bound chromium by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy were performed as described recently (18Quievryn G. Messer J. Zhitkovich A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3156-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The detection limit was 0.4 pmol of chromium. The half-life of chromium adducts was determined by the following formula: t½ = ln 2/k, where k is the exponential coefficient determined from the plots of the number of adducts versus time. NER-dependent loss of adducts/min/cell was calculated using the initial number of lesions and their half-life adjusted for the spontaneous loss of DNA-bound chromium (22Quievryn G. Zhitkovich A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1573-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The average half-life of chromium-DNA adducts in three XP cells was used as the rate of NER-unrelated loss. All rate calculations were adjusted for cell proliferation. In Situ Cellular Fractionation and Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on Superfrost Plus slides, exposed to 20 J/m2 UVC light at 254 nm (21Quievryn G. Peterson E. Messer J. Zhitkovich A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or treated with H2O2 for 1 h or with Cr(VI) for 3 h, and then returned to the regular medium. At the indicated times, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and extracted in a modified cytoskeleton buffer (100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) at 4 °C for 10 min. This was followed by incubation in extraction buffer (cytoskeleton buffer plus 250 mm ammonium sulfate) at 4 °C for 5 min. Nuclear DNA was digested with 300 units/ml DNase I (United States Biochemical Corp.) in cytoskeleton buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed with extraction buffer for 5 min and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Double labeling was performed by simultaneous incubation of primary antibodies for XPA (Pharmingen) and lamin A (Cell Signaling) for 2 h at 37°Cina humidified chamber, followed by addition of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20. After each incubation, slides were rinsed five times with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. Nuclei were then counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescence images were recorded using a Nikon Eclipse E800 digital microscope and analyzed by SPOT software. Shuttle Vector Experiments—Binary Cr(III)-DNA adducts were generated by reacting the pSP189 plasmid with 0–60 μm freshly dissolved (Cr(H2O)4Cl2)Cl·2H2O (18Quievryn G. Messer J. Zhitkovich A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3156-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To form ternary cysteine-Cr(III)-DNA adducts, pSP189 DNA was modified in the presence of 0–75 μm Cr(VI) and 2 mm cysteine (20Zhitkovich A. Song Y. Quievryn G. Voitkun V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Shuttle vector mutagenesis experiments were performed as described previously (20Zhitkovich A. Song Y. Quievryn G. Voitkun V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Quievryn G. Peterson E. Messer J. Zhitkovich A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In brief, control and chromium-modified plasmids were transfected into XP-A and XPA+ fibroblasts and propagated for 48 h. Replicated progeny of the plasmids was isolated and electroporated into the E. coli MBL50 strain, and the yield of bacterial transformants and supF mutants was scored on ampicillin- and ampicillin/arabinose-containing plates, respectively. Cytotoxicity—For analysis of clonogenic survival, 500–1000 cells were seeded onto 100-mm dishes and treated with Cr(VI) or cisplatin for 3 h or with H2O2 for 1 h, and colonies were counted after 12–16 days. Short-term toxicity was determined by trypan blue staining. A caspase-cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase fragment was detected by Western blotting using anti-85 kDa poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibody (Cell Signaling), and protein extracts were obtained by lysis of cells in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na2P2O7, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. Intact lamin A and cleaved lamin A were detected in whole cell lysates obtained by boiling of cells in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Knockdown of XPA Expression in H460 Cells—Stable down-regulation of XPA expression in lung epithelial H460 cells was achieved by infection with a pRETRO-XPA retroviral vector encoding a hairpin-forming small interfering RNA (siRNA). This vector was constructed by digestion of pRETRO-SUPER with HindIII and BglII, followed by ligation with a 5′-gatccccGCTACTGGAGGCATGGCTAttcaagagaTAGCCATGCCTCCAGTAGCtttttggaaa-3′/5′agcttttccaaaaaGCTACTGGAGGCATGGCTAtctcttgaaTAGCCATGCCTCCAGTAGCggg-3′ double-stranded oligonucleotide. The nucleotides directed to XPA are indicated in uppercase letters. Viral particles were packaged in 293T cells by cotransfection with plasmids encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope protein and Moloney murine leukemia virus capsid protein and reverse transcripase. H460 cells were infected twice at 24-h intervals and selected in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml puromycin for 48 h. The efficiency of XPA down-regulation was determined by Western blotting of protein extracts obtained as described for poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase analysis. Repair of Chromium-DNA Adducts in NER+ and NER– Human Cells—The role of NER in the removal of chromium-DNA adducts was first examined by determining the rate of repair of chromium adducts from chromosomal DNA in NER-competent cells and those deficient in one of the essential NER proteins. Chromium-DNA adducts were formed by treatment of SV40-immortalized human fibroblasts with 5 μm Cr(VI) for 3 h, a dose that did not induce any detectable toxicity or cell cycle changes over a 36-h post-exposure interval as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (G1 phase, 52.4 versus 49.6% for control and chromium-treated XPA+ cells, respectively; S phase, 25.6 versus 26.2%; and G2/M phase, 19.8 versus 20.6%). The first DNA samples were collected 3 h after the treatment to ensure that both Cr(VI) metabolism and Cr(III)-DNA binding were complete. Fig. 1A shows that the loss of chromium-DNA adducts from XPA+ cells was much faster relative to XP-A cells and that it followed single-component log-linear kinetics during the first 24 h. At 36 h post-exposure, XP-A cells retained 15.5 times more chromium-DNA adducts than the isogenic XPA+ counterpart. XP-A cells displayed no decrease in the amount of DNA-bound chromium during the first 9 h, whereas XPA+ cells lost 70% of the chromium adducts over this time. The initial levels of chromium-DNA adducts in XP-A/XPA+ cells were essentially identical and were similar to those in WT/SV cells expressing the endogenous XPA gene (20, 22, and 20 chromium adducts/104 DNA phosphates, respectively). To further verify the importance of NER in the removal of chromium-DNA damage, we measured the rate of repair of chromium adducts in NER+ WT/SV fibroblasts and two NER– cell lines that are deficient in other NER proteins, XPC and XPF (Fig. 1, B and C). XP-C and XP-F fibroblasts also exhibited a very slow removal of chromium-DNA adducts, which was comparable with XP-A cells. The average half-life of chromium-DNA adducts in three SV40-transformed NER– cells was 43.9 h versus 6.7 h in two NER+ cells (6.5-fold difference). NER of chromium-DNA damage did not appear to be affected by SV40 immortalization, as primary IMR90 fibroblasts had a similar rate of repair, with t½ = 8.2 h (Fig. 1C). The residual loss of DNA-bound chromium in XP cells was probably caused by slow ligand exchange reactions with intracellular inorganic phosphate (20Zhitkovich A. Song Y. Quievryn G. Voitkun V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Nuclear Dynamics of the XPA Protein in UV Light- and Cr(VI)-treated Cells—Recent studies using localized UV irradiation of cellular nuclei have found that the XPA protein becomes immobilized at the sites of DNA damage (23Volker M. Mone M.J. Karmakar P. van Hoffen A. Schul W. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Driel R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 24Rademakers S. Volker M. Hoogstraten D. Nigg A.L. Mone M.J. van Zeeland A.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Houtsmuller A.B. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5755-5767Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA damage, the majority of XPA rapidly moves throughout the nucleus, indicating the absence of its association with nuclear structures. Because NER is the only known function of XPA, stable binding of this protein to nuclear DNA could be used as the indicator of DNA lesions processed by NER in vivo. Unlike UV irradiation, DNA damage by chemical agents could not be directed to a particular nuclear location, which requires a different strategy for the detection of immobilized XPA-NER complexes. We reasoned that the presence of immobilized XPA-NER complexes could become evident by washing out nucleoplasmic XPA with detergent extractions. We studied binding of XPA to nuclear structures using a mild low salt fractionation procedure, which preserves nuclear morphology and yields a well developed interior nuclear matrix (25He D. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Potential precipitation and aggregation artifacts were further minimized by performing this procedure in situ. To validate our approach, we first examined the nuclear distribution of the XPA protein in UV light-treated WT/SV cells (Fig. 2A). As expected, UV light-treated (but not control) cells exhibited a strong nuclear association of XPA. Interestingly, even after the complete in situ digestion of chromatin DNA with DNase I (evidenced by the lack of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole signal), anti-XPA staining remained similar to that in permeabilized nuclei, indicating that the majority of immobilized XPA protein was bound to the nuclear matrix of UV light-damaged cells. Immobilization of XPA protein at the sites of UV light-damaged DNA was previously found to be XPC-dependent (24Rademakers S. Volker M. Hoogstraten D. Nigg A.L. Mone M.J. van Zeeland A.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Houtsmuller A.B. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5755-5767Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that the stable association of XPA with permeabilized nuclei and the nuclear matrix of UV light-treated cells required the presence of functional XPC protein (Fig. 2B). Thus, these experiments showed that our in situ fractionation procedure was capable of detecting the presence of damaged DNA-bound XPA-NER complexes. Immunostaining of Cr(VI)-exposed WT/SV fibroblasts also revealed a strong nuclear retention of the XPA protein and its recruitment to the nuclear matrix (Fig. 2A). Control experiments revealed no increase in binding of secondary antibodies to nuclei of Cr(VI)-treated cells (data not shown). Time course studies showed that nuclear binding of the XPA protein was significantly decreased after 18 h and was no longer detectable after 24 h (data not shown), at which point cells removed ∼95% of the chromium-DNA adducts (Fig. 1B). Unlike NER-proficient cells, treatment of XP-C fibroblasts with 5 μm Cr(VI) did not cause any increase in XPA binding to the nuclear structures at 3 h post-exposure (Fig. 2B). This result was not caused by the inefficient formation of chromium-DNA damage in XP-C cells, as they and WT/SV fibroblasts had very similar initial levels of chromium-DNA adducts (19 and 20 chromium adducts/104 DNA phosphates, respectively). XPA association with nuclei of XP-C cells was also absent at longer post-exposure times and up to five times higher concentrations of Cr(VI) (data not shown), indicating an absolute requirement of functional XPC protein for the assembly of XPA-containing NER complexes at chromium-damaged DNA. To test whether oxidative DNA damage can also stimulate tight nuclear binding of XPA, we immunostained WT/SV cells treated with a toxic dose of H2O2 (50 μm, 1% clonogenic survival) (Fig. 2C). There was no detectable increase in stable XPA complexes in these cells, indicating that accumulation of XPA in the nuclear matrix of cells treated with mildly toxic doses of Cr(VI) was not a result of processing of oxidative DNA lesions. Tight nuclear binding of XPA was also absent in cells exposed to lower concentrations of H2O2 (10 and 25 μm) (data not shown). Replication of Chromium-modified Plasmids in XPA– and XPA+ Cells—The role of NER in repair of individual chromium-DNA adducts was examined by replicating chromium-modified pSP189 plasmids in XPA– and XPA+ fibroblasts. Propagation of Cr(III)-adducted plasmids in XPA– cells produced on average a three times higher number of the supF mutants relative to XPA+ cells (Fig. 3A). XPA deficiency only modestly decreased the yield of replicated progeny of Cr(III)-modified plasmids, indicating that the major genotoxic lesions are probably not substrates for NER. Reaction of Cr(III) with DNA generates monofunctional Cr(III)-DNA adducts, a fraction of which undergo further rearrangements to produce DNA interstrand cross-links (26Bridgewater L.C. Manning F.C.R. Patierno S.R. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15 (F. C. R.): 2421-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). DNA cross-links are potent polymerase-blocking lesions (26Bridgewater L.C. Manning F.C.R. Patierno S.R. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15 (F. C. R.): 2421-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27O'Brien T. Mandel G.H. Pritchard D.E. Patierno S.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12529-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and repaired by XPA-independent processes (28De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 29Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Exposure of mammalian cells to Cr(VI) generates abundant ternary chromium-DNA adducts, among which the cysteine-Cr(III)-DNA cross-link is the most frequent DNA modification (17Zhitkovich A. Voitkun V. Costa M. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18Quievryn G. Messer J. Zhitkovich A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3156-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Replication of cysteine cross-link-containing plasmids in XPA– cells significantly increased both mutagenic and genotoxic responses relative to isogenic XPA+ cells (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating the importance of NER in repair of this major Cr(VI)-induced DNA adduct. Effect of NER Status on Toxicity of Cr(VI)—To examine the biological significance of chromium-DNA adducts and NER in Cr(VI) injury, we studied cytotoxic responses in XPA– and XPA+ fibroblasts (Fig. 4). XPA– cells showed a much higher short-term toxicity and greatly enhanced apoptotic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamin A following Cr(VI) exposure. Apoptotic proteolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamin A reflects activation of caspase-3 and caspase-6, respectively (30Degterev A. Boyce M. Yuan J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8543-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Reduced apoptosis in XPA+ cells also led to their better long-term survival after chromium-DNA damage (Fig. 4D). The difference in clonogenic survival between XPA– and XPA+ cells for Cr(VI) was similar to that for cisplatin (Fig. 4E), whose toxicity is known to be higher in NER-deficient cells due to their inability to repair major platinum-DNA adducts (5You J.S. Wang M. Lee S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7476-7485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We found no significant effect of XPA status on clonogenic survival after treatment with H2O2 (–1.60 and –1.61 slopes for XPA– and XPA+ fibroblasts, respectively), indicating that decreased survival of Cr(VI)-treated NER– fibroblasts was caused by the deficient repair of chromium-DNA adducts. Because the lung is the main target of toxic and carcinogenic effects of Cr(VI), we also examined the role of NER in response to chromium-DNA damage in human lung epithelial H460 cells. As with fibroblasts, exposure of H460 cells to Cr(VI) stimulated tight binding of XPA to the nuclear structures, which persisted after digestion of chromosomal DNA by DNase I (Fig. 5A). The importance of NER and chromium-DNA adducts in cytotoxic responses of these cells was investigated by down-regulating XPA levels through stable expression of targeting siRNA (Fig. 5B). The siRNA-expressing cells showed a 70% decrease in the XPA amount relative to the parental or vector-transfected cells, and this significantly inhibited their NER capacity by increasing the half-life of chromium-DNA adducts by 3.0-fold, from 7.1 to 21.6 h (Fig. 5C). Down-regulation of XPA levels by siRNA did not change the initial levels of chromium-DNA modifications (at 1 μm chromium, 10.7 and 9.4 chromium adducts/104 DNA phosphates for XPA knockdown and control cells, respectively; and at 5 μm chromium, 59.9 and 64.9 chromium adducts/104 DNA phosphates). The difference in survival between vector- and siRNA-transfected H460 cells was somewhat smaller than that observed between XPA– and XPA+ fibroblasts, which could be attributed to the remaining activity of NER in siRNA-expressing H460 cells. Unlike Cr(VI)-induced damage, vector- and siRNA-transfected H460 cells exhibited similar clonogenic survival after exposure to H2O2 (–0.8 and –0.82 slopes, respectively). Thus, a protective role of NER against Cr(VI) toxicity is common to cells of different histological origin and reflects the importance of this repair process in the removal of chromium-DNA monoadducts. Time course analyses of chromium-DNA adducts in normal and XP fibroblasts from three complementation groups clearly showed that NER status is the main determining factor in the intracellular persistence of these lesions. Increased mutagenicity of two chromium-DNA adducts in NER– cells and a longer half-life of chromium-DNA modifications in lung epithelial H460 cells with down-regulated expression of the XPA protein further confirmed the importance of human NER in the removal of chromium-DNA damage. Human NER was quite efficient in the detection and removal of chromium-DNA adducts, as indicated by a short half-life of these lesions, averaging 7.1 h for four NER+ human cell lines. For comparison, (6-4) photoproducts, which are considered to be the best natural NER substrate, have a half-life of ∼2 h in mammalian cells (32Perdiz D. Grof P. Mezzina M. Nikaido O. Moustacchi E. Sage E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26732-26742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33van Hoffen A. Venema J. Meschini R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). CPDs, another major UV light-induced DNA lesion, are removed by NER at a much slower rate, with t½ = 17 h (33van Hoffen A. Venema J. Meschini R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The rate of NER of bulky benzo-[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxide-DNA adducts was found to be dependent on the amount of the initial damage, with the half-life varying from 4 to >24 h for a low and high number of adducts, respectively (34Venkatachalam S. Denissenko M. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, based on the half-life comparison with other lesions, chromium-DNA adducts appear to be a good substrate for cellular NER. Another measure of susceptibility to repair is the rate of lesion removal per unit of time. Using the reported 50% repair values and the initial amount of damage (34Venkatachalam S. Denissenko M. Wani A.A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2029-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we calculated that the maximal rate of NER of benzo-[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol 9,10-epoxide-DNA adducts was ∼500 lesions/min/diploid cell. The same type of calculations showed that (6-4) photoproducts formed at NER-saturating UVC doses (32Perdiz D. Grof P. Mezzina M. Nikaido O. Moustacchi E. Sage E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26732-26742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33van Hoffen A. Venema J. Meschini R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) were removed at a rate of ∼13,000/min/cell. Our data for chromium-DNA adducts yielded remarkably rapid NER rates of 49,000 and 51,000 chromium lesions/min/cell for SV40-immortalized and primary IMR90 fibroblasts, respectively. This high absolute repair rate reflected processing of a very high number of adducts initially formed in the cells (20–25 chromium adducts/104 DNA phosphates). The calculated rates of repair are certainly biologically plausible considering that a human cell contains on the order of 105 molecules of each core NER factor (35Araujo S.J. Nigg E.A. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2281-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our results do not mean that chromium-DNA adducts are recognized and removed by NER more efficiently than (6-4) photoproducts. The most abundant forms of UVC light-induced DNA damage are slowly repaired CPDs (2Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 32Perdiz D. Grof P.

Mullenders L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which probably sequester many NER factors and thereby decrease the actual number of repair complexes available for the removal of (6-4) photoproducts. The NER substrate has been defined as a DNA lesion formed by chemical modification of the DNA structure that causes a significant disruption of base pairing (36Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 37Sugasawa K. Okamoto T. Shimizu Y. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). DNA duplex distortion alone is not sufficient to activate the NER process, as DNA mismatches of various sizes are resistant to repair by NER. However, the presence of DNA duplex distortions in the vicinity of a DNA modification is required for NER because non-distorting C-4′ deoxyribose substitutions are repaired by human NER only in combination with disrupted base pairing (36Hess M.T. Schwitter U. Petretta M. Giese B. Naegeli H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6664-6669Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the case of UV light-induced lesions, there is a very good concordance between the susceptibility to NER and the extent of DNA distortion by the lesion: a slowly repaired CPD induces a minor kink of 9°, whereas rapidly repaired (6-4) photoproducts bend DNA by 44° (38Kim J.K. Patel D. Choi B.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Consequently, easy repairability of bulky DNA adducts has been commonly attributed to their induction of major distortions in the DNA structure. DNA phosphate adducts do not generate major helix distortions, although the presence of structural changes is clearly detectable. As a consequence of charge neutralization, one phosphate adduct bends DNA by 3.5° (39Tomky L.A. Strauss-Soukup J.K. Maher III, L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and unwinds the duplex by ∼2° (40Blankert S.A. Coryell V.H. Picard B.T. Wolf K.K. Lomas R.E. Stearns D.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Clonogenic survival of XP-A fibroblasts containing one unrepairable chromium adduct/500 DNA phosphates was only modestly decreased (Fig. 3, 5 μm chromium dose), providing biological evidence that chromium-phosphate adducts do not induce major structural changes, as they were well tolerated by human cells. Our findings on a rapid repair of chromium-DNA phosphate adducts indicate that the bulkiness by itself could be a very important determinant of a good NER substrate, perhaps because lesion verification is a rate-limiting step in NER and the presence of large chemical modifications is easy to detect. Unlike weakly distorting CPDs, whose removal by NER requires p53-dependent expression of the p48 subunit of the UV-DDB complex (2Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 6Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), NER of chromium-DNA adducts does not appear to be p53-dependent, as SV40-immortalized cells with functionally inactivated p53 and primary IMR90 fibroblasts repaired chromium adducts with essentially identical rates. This result is consistent with the idea that weakly distorting, but bulky modifications can be efficiently detected and processed by the core NER machinery. Cr(III) forms hexacoordinate complexes arranged in an octahedral configuration (16Zhitkovich A. Wilson S.H. Suk W.A. Biomarkers of Environmentally Associated Disease: Technologies, Concepts, and Perspectives. CRC Press LLC, New York2002: 267-285Google Scholar), which creates spatially bulky modifications that, unlike linear alkyl groups, cannot be positioned in either of the DNA grooves. Even on the basis of the molecular weight (Mr = 207 for the cysteine-chromium cross-link), chromium-DNA adducts are ∼10 times larger than the corresponding methyl- or ethylphosphotriesters, and this may largely account for the much better repairability of chromium lesions relative to alkylphosphate adducts (14Branum M.E. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25421-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 15Bodell W.J. Singer B. Thomas G.H. Cleaver J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 2819-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Biochemical fractionation studies of UV light-irradiated cells have previously detected nuclear retention of a portion of total XPA after nuclease digestions (40Blankert S.A. Coryell V.H. Picard B.T. Wolf K.K. Lomas R.E. Stearns D.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2003; 16: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 41Otrin V.R. McLenigan M. Takao M. Levine A.S. Protic M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was not interpreted as evidence of nuclear matrix binding because of a different operational designation of this nuclear component, which was defined as nuclear material remaining after nuclease digestion and extraction with 2 m NaCl. The interior nuclear matrix obtained by 2 m NaCl extractions consists of a network of thin core filaments supported by nuclear RNA, whereas the low salt procedure (as employed here) yields a better preserved nuclear morphology and a more developed interior matrix containing thick polymorphic fibers (25He D. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). This suggests that XPA complexes participating in global NER are probably bound to the polymorphic fibers of the interior nuclear matrix, whereas components of transcription-coupled repair, such as CSA (42Kamiuchi S. Saijo M. Citterio E. de Jager M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Tanaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), associate with the RNA-rich core filaments."

However, the role of Wnt in regulating normal intestinal epithelial cell proliferation is not well established.

Treatment of IEC6 cells with Wnt11 conditioned media failed to induce nuclear translocation of β-catenin but led to increased activities of protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Inhibition of protein kinase C resulted in a decreased ability of Wnt11 to induce foci formation in IEC6 cells. Finally, E-cadherin was redistributed in Wnt11-treated IEC6 cells, resulting in diminished E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact. We conclude that Wnt11 stimulates proliferation, migration, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and contact-independent growth of IEC6 cells by a β-catenin-independent mechanism.

Tumors are thought to originate from these crypt cells although progression into malignancy requires additional transforming signals that further enhance growth, invasiveness, and differentiation (3Bienz M.

The analysis of Wnt expression in the gastrointestinal tract has been performed largely in the context of embryonic development (19Lickert H. Domon C. Huls G. Wehrle C. Duluc I. Clevers H. Meyer B.I.

From these studies, several Wnts have been identified as potential signaling molecules in intestinal cancers including Wnts 2, 4, 5a, 6, 7a, and 11. In contrast, there is relatively sparse literature that examines the expression of Wnts in the normal adult intestinal tract (24Holcombe R.F. Marsh J.L. Waterman M.L. Lin F. Milovanovic T. Truong T. Mol. Pathol. 2002; 55: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the significance of the Wnt signaling pathway is illustrated by recent studies (25Kuhnert F. Davis C.R. Wang H.-T. Chu P. Lee M. Yuan J. Nusse R. Kuo C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 101: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 26Pinto D. Gregorieff A. Begthel H. Clevers H. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) showing that overexpression of a Wnt inhibitor, Dickkopf1 (DKK1), can inhibit proliferation of the intestinal epithelial cells in mice. Although the classical (“canonical”) mechanism by which Wnt exerts its action depends on the nuclear localization of β-catenin and subsequent transcriptional activation of target genes (17Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 27Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Biochim. Biophys.

Clevers H. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 961-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), increasing evidence indicates that β-catenin-independent (“noncanonical”) mechanisms are also important in signal transduction initiated by Wnt (30Veeman M.T. Axelrod J.D. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 31Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T.

BioEssays. 2002; 24: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For example, β-catenin-independent Wnt signal transduction has been shown to involve the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-independent kinase II (CamKII) and protein kinase C (PKC) in a manner that is modulated by intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ (33Kuhl M.

Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Evidence also indicates that activators of the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway can antagonize the β-catenin-dependent Wnt pathway (38Kuhl M. Geis K. Sheldahl L.C. Pukrop T. Moon R.T. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 39Ishitani T. Kishida S. Hyodo-Miura J. Ueno N. Yasuda J. Waterman M. Shibuya H. Moon R.T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1123-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible mechanism by which cell proliferation can be modulated. This antagonism might explain why inactivating mutations in Wnts that function through alternative pathways are also associated with a transformed phenotype (41Olson D.J. Gibo D.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The co-existence of multiple Wnts that function via multiple pathways in the intestine suggests a complex interplay and perhaps sub-compartmentalization of effects of Wnt signaling that has not thoroughly been investigated to date. To characterize further the function of the Wnt family of proteins in regulating intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, we aimed at establishing the identity and location of Wnts expressed in the mouse intestinal tract and at characterizing such Wnts with regard to intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. We show that Wnt11 is one protein in this family that has a relatively compartmentalized pattern of expression in the gut, and that both exogenous treatment of intestinal epithelial cells IEC6 with Wnt11 and overexpression of Wnt11 in IEC6 result in accelerated proliferation, migration, and transformation in a manner that is dependent on PKC and/or CamKII but independent of β-catenin. These findings underscore the importance of noncanonical signaling pathways of Wnt in modulating proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells. Cell Lines—The nontransformed rat small intestinal epithelial cell line, IEC6 (42Quaroni A. Isselbacher K.J. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 0.1 units/ml insulin. C57MG-Wnt1, provided by A. Levine (see Ref. 44Xu L. Corcoran R.B. Welsh J.W. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Caco2-BBE cells, provided by D. Merlin (see Ref. 45Buyse M. Charrier L. Sitaraman S. Gewirtz A. Merlin D. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1969-1977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), were both cultured in DMEM and 10% FBS. All media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. A Wnt11-transfected quail cell line, W11ox, and its parental cell line, QCE6 (46Eisenberg C.A. Eisenberg L.M. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), were cultured on fibronectin-coated plates (1 μg/cm3 fibronectin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) in media consisting of minimum essential medium with 292 mg/liter glutamine, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 2% heat-inactivated chicken serum, 10% iron-supplemented calf serum, and 200 μg/ml G418 for W11ox. Generation of Conditioned Media—The media (control media) used to generate conditioned media (CM) were minimum essential medium supplemented with insulin/transferrin/selenium, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 4 g/liter Albumax, and 20 μg/liter dexamethasone. Conditioned media were generated by culturing W11ox cells to 60% confluency, washed once with control media, and maintained in control media for an 3 additional days. The conditioned media were harvested, centrifuged to remove debris, and stored at -80 °C. Conditioned media were depleted of Wnt11 protein by incubation with 4 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse Wnt11 antibody at 4 °C overnight. Generation of Wnt11 Transfectants of IEC6 Cells—A full-length cDNA encoding the mouse Wnt11 was obtained by PCR amplification based on the published sequence and cloned into a TA cloning vector, pCR®-II (Invitrogen). The cDNA was then subcloned into the EcoRI restriction sites of the expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and sequenced for orientation and fidelity. IEC6 cells were transfected by electroporation (300 V, 1 millifarad) with pcDNA3-Wnt11 or the pCDNA3 vector control. Transfectants were selected in 1 mg/ml G418. Independent stable populations were tested for their ability to form foci in soft agar by plating 104 cells in 2.5% agar culture medium with antibiotic selection on plates with a 5% agar base. Cells were cultured for 3 weeks, and visible foci were selected and clonally expanded for further analysis (IEC6/W11 cells). IEC6 cells stably transfected with the pcDNA3 vector were selected with G418 and pooled as controls (IEC6/V cells). Co-culture Experiments—5 × 105 IEC6 cells were co-cultured in 10-cm2 dishes with 102 W11ox cells in antibiotic-free W11ox culture media. Media were changed every 4 days, and cells were monitored for foci after 3 weeks. Co-culture experiments were performed in transwell plates with 6-well polyester inserts (Corning Glass) with 0.4-μm membrane pore sizes. 105 W11ox cells were plated in the wells as a feeder layer, and 105 IEC6 cells were plated in the inserts and both grown in G418-free W11ox media. Media were changed once a week, and monolayers were observed after 3 weeks of culture. Foci images were captured on a Coolpix MDC Lens (Nikon). Foci sizes were measured after staining transwell membranes with 0.1% methylene blue following fixation in 75% ethanol. Differentiation Model Using Caco2-BBE Cells—Caco2-BBE cells were cultured to confluency in growth media and then allowed to continue growing in control CM, W11 CM, or normal growth media. Cells were harvested at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 18 days post-confluency for standard fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to determine the cell cycle profiles. Harvested cells were trypsinized, pelleted, washed twice in PBS, fixed in ethanol prior to staining with propidium iodide, and analyzed using FACS techniques (47Yoon H.S. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2101-2105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The percentages of cells in G1 and S phases were compared among different treatments. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA extracted from multiple tissues of wild type C57BL/6 mice was prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Colon and small intestine RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) and Superscript II (Invitrogen). Degenerate primers for Wnt genes spanning the conserved 5′ and 3′ sequences of QECKCH and FHWCC (48Gavin B.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) were used to amplify all Wnt species from the cDNA pool by PCR, with the expected product size ranging between 400 and 550 bp. Specific primers for amplifying Wnt1, Wnt3a, Wnt4, Wnt5a, and Wnt11 (Table I), based on representation in embryonic tissues (20Lickert H. Kispert A. Kutsch S. Kemler R. Mech. Dev. 2001; 105: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), were also used to amplify Wnts from the cDNA pool. Primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Amplified products were separated on 1% agarose gels. PCR products were cloned using the TOPO-TA kit for sequencing (Invitrogen) and submitted for sequence analysis (Emory DNA Core Facility).Table ISequences of primers used to amplify Wnt sequencesProductPrimer sequenceWnt degenerateReverse, AAAATCTAGARCARCACCARTGRAAForward, GGGGAATTCCARGARTGYAARTGYCATWnt1Reverse, GCACGTCAACGCCGTCGACTGCForward, CGGTTCTCACGTTTACGGTGCCWnt3aReverse, GGTCACCACCCACCTATATCGForward, GTGGGTATCTTGTCTTGTCTGAGWnt4Reverse, GCCGGTCGAGGTGAACGCGForward, GCACGACCGCACGACAGGGWnt5aReverse, CTGTATCGTCGTGGTCACTTTGAACGForward, GTGCATGCGCCACTCGCGTCGAWnt11Reverse, CTTGCAGACGTAGCGCTCCAForward, TCCAACGGAAGCGACAGCTG Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from intestinal and nonintestinal tissue was separated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Nytran membrane (Hybond™; Amersham Biosciences) for Northern blot analysis. Complementary cDNA probes encoding Wnt11 and β-actin were labeled with [α-32P]dATP by using random priming kits (Stratagene) and purified with MicroBio® spin P-30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). Blots were pre-hybridized in QuikHyb® hybridization reagent (Stratagene) at 68 °C for 20 min, hybridized with labeled probe for 1 h, washed in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS twice for 15 min at room temperature, and washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 30 min before autoradiography. Proliferation Assays—IEC6 cells at 70-80% confluency were trypsinized and plated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 103 cells per well and allowed to attach for 4 h in IEC6 media. Media were then replaced with IEC6 growth media containing 5% FBS, control serum-free media (control CM), Wnt11 conditioned media from W11ox (W11 CM), or depleted W11 CM. At the specified time points, cells were assayed for proliferation by incubation for 2 h with an MTS-based reagent (Promega/Roche Applied Science), a colorimetric method for the determination of viable cells in proliferation. MTS is bioreduced by cells into a formazan that is soluble in tissue culture medium and can be measured directly on a multiplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 490 nm. Western Blot Analysis, PKC, and CamKII Assays—Protein was extracted from cultured cells by incubation in 1× lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), vortexed, and followed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 20 min. Protein lysates were quantified by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was performed by standard protocols using a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against a mouse Wnt11 peptide, W11259 (49Christiansen J.H. Monkley S.J. Wainwright B.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2705-2711PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Protein lysates were also used in PKC and CamKII activity assays using the PepTag® nonradioactive detection of protein kinase C assay kit (Promega; V5330) or radioactive protein kinase C and CamKII assay kits (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., catalog numbers 17-139 and 17-135, respectively). An active and purified PKC enzyme was used as a positive control, and water or lysis buffer was used as a negative control. In certain experiments, calphostin C (Calbiochem) was included to inhibit PKC at a concentration of 100 nm in Me2SO. Migration Assays—IEC6 cells grown to confluency were scratched with a 0.5-mm pipette tip to cause wounding. Images were taken of all cultures immediately following wounding, and the location was referenced by indelible ink. Media were replaced with 5% serum media, control CM, W11 CM, or depleted W11 CM. Images of the plates at the referenced locations were captured at intervals of 6 and 24 h. The wound gap was measured, and the percent wound repair was determined for each time point. All treatments were assessed in triplicate. Luciferase Assays—IEC6 cells were harvested from a 70-80% sub-confluent culture and resuspended in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM at a concentration of 1.25 × 107 cells/ml. Transfection was performed by electroporation (300 V, 1 millifarad) of 107 cells with 15 μg of TCF3WT-pGLS-luciferase (Clontech) and co-transfected with 0.5 μg of cytomegalovirus-Renilla luciferase and pEGFP-EC3 (Clontech) constructs as transfection controls. Fifty μl of the transfected cells were plated in 6-well plates overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Test media were then added, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h prior to harvesting and assaying for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) per the manufacturer's protocol. Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry—Immunofluorescence was performed on cells cultured on coverslips to 50-80% confluency and treated with 5% serum media, control CM, Wnt11, or Wnt1 conditioned media for 8 h. The cultures were washed twice in PBS, incubated in methanol at -20 °C for 15 min, and washed twice in cold PBS. Cells were blocked for 1 h in 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with the following primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:100 dilution, β-catenin, E-cadherin, and LI-cadherin, and then washed three times for 5 min in PBS followed by a 1-h incubation in the secondary antibodies anti-mouse IgG FITC 1:300 and anti-goat FITC 1:160 (Sigma). The nuclear stain To-Pro3 (Molecular Probes) was added to the final PBS wash (200 ng/ml); the coverslips were rinsed once in double-distilled H2O and mounted onto coverslips with mounting media (Sigma) for observation under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon eclipse TS-100 and/or LSM 510 Zeiss Confocal Microscope). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against a mouse Wnt11 peptide (49Christiansen J.H. Monkley S.J. Wainwright B.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2705-2711PubMed Google Scholar) was used for immunohistochemistry. Paraffin-embedded sections from the colon and jejunum of two C57BL/6 mice were incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of the primary antibody followed by immunodetection by standard techniques. A 2-h incubation with 5× blocking peptide was performed prior to immunohistochemistry as a control. Identification and Localization of Wnt11 in Mouse Tissues—In order to identify Wnt molecules that are expressed in normal adult mouse gastrointestinal tract, C57BL/6 mouse colon and small intestine were harvested and RNA extracted. Following reverse transcription, cDNAs were amplified using primers specific for Wnts shown previously to be present in embryonic intestine or associated with intestinal cancers. By using these sequence-specific primers, only Wnt11 was amplified, whereas the remaining primers against Wnt 1, 3a, 4, and 5a did not yield any products. As a further screen for intestinal Wnt expression, reverse-transcribed cDNA was PCR-amplified using well characterized degenerate primers against the conserved regions of known Wnts (48Gavin B.J. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, this approach did not identify any other Wnt genes as candidates for intestinal tract expression. Thus, we focused subsequent experiments on Wnt11. We first determined the tissue distribution of Wnt11 transcripts in a panel of RNA extracted from various adult mouse tissues. As shown in Fig. 1 by Northern blot analysis, Wnt11 transcripts were present in the distal and proximal colon and small intestine as well as a variety of other tissues including the liver, kidney, spleen, heart, brain, and whole embryo. These data are consistent with reports of function of Wnt11 in kidney (50Kispert A. Vainio S. Shen L. Rowitch D.H. McMahon A.P. Development. 1996; 122: 3627-3637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and heart morphogenesis (46Eisenberg C.A. Eisenberg L.M. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 216: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 51Pandur P. Lasche M. Eisenberg L.M. Kuhl M. Nature. 2002; 418: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The presence of Wnt11 transcript in both small and large intestines suggests that it may serve an equally important function in the intestinal tract. Cellular Localization of Wnt11 in the Intestinal Tract—To localize further the specific cell types in the intestinal tract that express Wnt11, we performed immunohistochemical studies of the adult mouse jejunum and colon using a polyclonal antibody generated against a mouse Wnt11 peptide (49Christiansen J.H. Monkley S.J. Wainwright B.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2705-2711PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibody was demonstrated by the lack of signals in sections that were blocked with excessive amounts of the peptide antigen (Fig. 2 B, D, and F). As seen in Fig. 2, A, C, and E, the smooth muscle in both muscularis propria and muscularis mucosa in the jejunum, distal colon, and proximal colon, respectively, stained strongly. Staining was also observed in cells of the lamina propria but not in the submucosa. Finally, epithelial cells lining both the crypt region as well as the villus and surface epithelium of the small and large intestine, respectively, stained positively. The presence of Wnt11 in the intestinal epithelium prompted us to investigate further the biological function of Wnt11 in intestinal epithelial cells. The Effect of Wnt11 on Intestinal Epithelial Differentiation—We first examined the effect of Wnt11 on cell differentiation because of its presence in the differentiated epithelial cells within the intestinal epithelium. This was accomplished by studying the effect of Wnt11 on a well established culture model of intestinal epithelial differentiation, Caco2-BBE (45Buyse M. Charrier L. Sitaraman S. Gewirtz A. Merlin D.

A long list of data supports a role for DNMT1 in cellular transformation and inhibitors of DNMT1 were shown to have antitumorigenic effects. It was long believed that DNMT1 promoted tumorigenesis by maintaining the hypermethylated and silenced state of tumor suppressor genes. We have previously shown that DNMT1 knock down by either antisense oligonucleotides directed at DNMT1 or expressed antisense activates a number of genes involved in stress response and cell cycle arrest by a DNA methylation-independent mechanism. In this report we demonstrate that antisense knock down of DNMT1 in human lung carcinoma A549 and embryonal kidney HEK293 cells induces gene expression by a mechanism that does not involve either of the known epigenomic mechanisms, DNA methylation, histone acetylation, or histone methylation. The mechanism of activation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and apoptosis inducer BIK by DNMT1 inhibition is independent of the mechanism of activation of the same genes by histone deacetylase inhibition. We determine whether DNMT1 knock down activates one of the nodal transcription activation pathways in the cell and demonstrate that DNMT1 activates Sp1 response elements. This activation of Sp1 response does not involve an increase in either Sp1 or Sp3 protein levels in the cell or the occupancy of the Sp1 elements with these proteins. The methylation-independent regulation of Sp1 elements by DNMT1 unravels a novel function for DNMT1 in gene regulation. DNA methylation was believed to be a mechanism for suppression of CG-rich Sp1-bearing promoters. Our data suggest a fundamentally different and surprising role for DNMT1 regulation of CG-rich genes by a mechanism independent of DNA methylation and histone acetylation. The implications of our data on the biological roles of DNMT1 and the therapeutic potential of DNMT1 inhibitors as anticancer agents are discussed.

DNA modification by methylation of cytosines residing at the dinucleotide sequence CG plays an important role in epigenomic programming of gene expression (1Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Not all CGs are methylated, and the pattern of distribution of methylated and unmethylated CGs is cell type-specific (2Razin A. Szyf M. Biochim. Biophys.

DNA methylation in regulatory regions of genes plays a role in silencing genes either by directly inhibiting the interaction of transcription factors with their regulatory sequences (3Comb M.

The mechanisms through which DNMT1 causes cellular transformation and through which inhibition of DNMT1 reverses cellular transformation are unknown (16Szyf M. Knox D.J. Milutinovic S. Slack A.D. Araujo F.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910 (discussion 175–177): 156-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The most obvious mechanism is that aberrant expression of DNMT1 causes methylation and silencing of tumor suppressor genes (17Herman J.G. Merlo A. Mao L. Lapidus R.G. Issa J.P. Davidson N.E. Sidransky D. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4525-4530PubMed Google Scholar, 18Merlo A. Herman J.G. Mao L. Lee D.J. Gabrielson E. Burger P.C. Baylin S.B. Sidransky D. Nat.

Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Schuebel K. Herman J.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 687-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance with this hypothesis, knock down of DNMT1 by either antisense or siRNA results in demethylation and activation of tumor suppressor genes such as p16 (14Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Robert M.F. Morin S. Beaulieu N. Gauthier F. Chute I.C. Barsalou A. MacLeod A.R. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar).However, it was surprisingly previously shown that knock down of DNMT1 results in induction of the unmethylated tumor suppressor gene p21 by a mechanism that does not involve DNA methylation (21Milutinovic S. Knox J.D. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6353-6359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that DNMT1 interacts with histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 (22Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) and 2 (23Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), suggesting that DNMT1 silences gene expression by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes. It was also shown that ectopic expression of DNMT1 could suppress exogenous genes bearing E2F1 sites by recruiting Rb·E2F1·HDAC1 complex (25Robertson K.D. Ait-Si-Ali S. Yokochi T. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether DNMT1 regulates endogenous genes by these mechanisms.We have previously shown that DNMT1 expression is regulated with the cell cycle (8Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G.

Chem. 1985; 260: 8653-8656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that antisense knock down of DNMT1 results in an intra-S-phase arrest of DNA replication (28Milutinovic S. Zhuang Q. Niveleau A. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14985-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This intra-S-phase arrest requires knock down of the DNMT1 protein rather than inhibition of DNA methylation, suggesting that DNMT1 protein plays an important role in the regulatory circuitry independent of its methyltransferase activity (29Szyf M. Ageing Res. Rev. 2003; 2: 299-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that antisense ODNs directed at DNMT1 exhibit sequence-specific down-regulation of DNMT1 and that they could be utilized to delineate the immediate consequences of knock down of the DNMT1 protein on gene expression and cellular regulation (14Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Robert M.F. Morin S. Beaulieu N.

In difference from agents such as 5-azacytidine that inhibit the catalytic activity of DNMT1 and, thus, mainly measure the DNA methylation-dependent roles of this protein (32Jones P.A. Taylor S.M. Wilson V.L. Recent Results Cancer Res. 1983; 84: 202-211PubMed Google Scholar), antisense knock down of DNMT1 causes an immediate arrest of DNA replication (28Milutinovic S. Zhuang Q. Niveleau A. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14985-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), resulting in limited passive demethylation. This allows us to study mainly DNA methylation-independent regulatory functions of DNMT1. We have previously shown that a number of stress response-related genes are activated by DNMT1 knock down (28Milutinovic S. Zhuang Q. Niveleau A. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14985-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this report we dissect the transcription factor pathway activated by DNMT1 knock down and show that surprisingly DNMT1 regulates gene expression by a new mechanism that does not involve either DNA methylation or chromatin modification. We show that DNMT1 knock down and histone deacetylation inhibition activate gene expression by independent mechanisms. These results have important implications on understanding the regulatory roles of DNMT1 in the cell cycle and cellular transformation, as well as on future approaches to targeting DNMT1 in anticancer therapy.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Antisense Oligonucleotides, and TSA Treatment—A549 cells, a human non-small cell lung carcinoma-derived cell line (33Giard D.J. Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. Arnstein P. Kersey J.H. Dosik H. Parks W.P. J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 1973; 51: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar) (ATCC:CCL 185), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. 18–24 h before treatment, cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish, or 4 × 104 cells/well in a six-well plate in the absence of antibiotics. The phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study were MG88 (human DNMT1 antisense) and its mismatch control MG208, which has a 6-bp difference from MG88 (14Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were transfected into cells at a concentration of 120 nm with 3.75 μg/ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The oligonucleotide-containing Opti-MEM was removed from the cells and replaced with regular growth media after 4 h. The treatment was repeated after 24 h. The cells were harvested 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, or 48 h after the first treatment. For TSA treatment, cells were grown in regular culture media in the presence of 1 μm of trichostatin A (TSA). The cells were harvested 2, 6, or 12 h after the initiation of treatment. HEK293 cells, a human adenovirus type 5-transformed human embryonal kidney cell line (ATCC, CRL 1573), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine.Western Blot Analysis—50 μg of nuclear protein was fractionated on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and reacted with the polyclonal anti-DNMT1 antibody (New England Biolabs) at a dilution of 1:2,000 in the presence of 0.05% Tween and 5% milk, and it was then reacted with anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:5,000 in the presence of 0.05% Tween and 5% milk. As a control for protein loading, β-actin protein levels were examined in the same nuclear extracts. 50 μg of protein was fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and reacted with the monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma, A5316) at a dilution of 1:5000 in the presence of 0.05% Tween and 5% milk, and it was then reacted with anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunochemicals) at a dilution of 1:20,000 in the presence of 0.05% Tween.RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 2 μg of total RNA, 40 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MBI), 5 μm random primer (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm of each of the deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 40 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). mRNA was denatured for 5 min at 70 °C, the random primers were annealed for 10 min at 25 °C, and the mRNA was reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 37 °C. The reverse transcriptase was heat-inactivated for 10 min at 70 °C, and the products were stored at –20 °C until use. PCRs were performed in a 40-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl of synthesized cDNA product, 4 μl of 10 × PCR buffer with (NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 unit of Taq polymerase (all from MBI), and 0.4 μm of each primer. Amplifications were performed in a Biometra T3 thermocycler (Biomedizinische Analytik GmbH). The primer sequences and the amplification programs were as follows: p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1) (sense, 5′-GCCCAGTGGACAGCGAGCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-GCCGGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGA-3′)95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 68 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 66 °C, 72 °C for 30 s each), 24 cycles (95 °C, 65 °C, and 72 °C 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min; BIK (BCL2-interacting killer) (sense, 5′-GGCCTGCTGCTGTTATCTTT-3′; antisense, 5′-CCAGTAGATTCTTTGCCGAG-3′) 95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 62 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), 29 cycles (95 °C, 58 °C, and 72 °C 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min; HSPA2 (heat shock protein 70-kDa 2) (sense, 5′-CTTTCGCCTTCTGCCGTGA-3′; antisense, 5′-ACTGCACTGTGGCATCCTC-3′)95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 58 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 56 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), 26 cycles (95 °C, 54 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min; β-actin (sense, 5′-GTTGCTAGCCAGGCTGTGCT-3′; antisense, 5′-CGGATGTCCACGTCACACTT-3′) 95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 66 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 64 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 62 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), and 17 cycles (95 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min. The number of cycles was tested and selected so that the PCR amplification remained in the linear phase. 20 μl of the PCR products were run on a 1.2% gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Densitometric analysis was performed using MCID software (Imaging Research Inc.).Bisulfite Mapping of the BIK Promoter—A549 cells were treated with 120 nm MG88 or MG208 for 24 h. Bisulfite mapping was performed as described previously with minor modifications (34Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). 50 ng of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA samples were subjected to PCR amplification using the first set of primers (sense, 5′-GTAAAAAAAGTTAGATTTGTGG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTCACCTCCTCTAAATACC-3′). PCR products were used as templates for the nested PCR using the second set of primers (sense, 5′-AGGGATTGGGGGAGGAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CAACTACTCACACCTCAAC-3′). The PCR products of the second reaction were subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), and the clones were sequenced using the T7 Sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences).Reporter Constructs and Luciferase Assay—The calcium phosphate precipitation method was used to transiently co-transfect HEK293 cells, plated in six-well dishes, with 2 μg of luciferase reporter constructs and 5 μg of either control pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) or a DNMT1 antisense (bp 396–5066) subcloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (as DNMT1). The reporter constructs that were used contained either full p21 promoter (–2326 bp) or four different 5′ deletions (–1481, –883, –291, and –94) upstream from the luciferase gene (35Somasundaram K. Zhang H. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1-responsive reporters were constructed using basic luciferase reporter containing only TATA box and initiator sequence (pGL2 T+I). An oligonucleotide containing consensus Sp1 binding site corresponding to the bases –71 to –86 of the p21 promoter was synthesized and inserted either once (1 × Sp1) or four times (4 × Sp1) into the pGL2 T+I vector (36Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and luciferase activity was assayed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.A549 cells plated in six-well dishes were transfected using 3.75 μg/ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and 0.5 μg of the reporter vectors containing different cis-acting enhancer elements upstream from the firefly luciferase gene. All the reporters, except for the 4 × Sp1, belong to the Mercury Pathway Profiling System (Clontech). 24 h after transfection, the cells were either treated with 120 nm MG88 and MG208 for 24 h or with 1 μm TSA for 6 h. The luciferase activity was assayed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega).The full p21 promoter-luciferase reporter construct (–2326 p21) was used to create a construct with 2-bp mutations (CC→GA) within the Sp1 site corresponding to bases between –71 and –86 of the p21 promoter (–2326 p21 CC→GA). A QuikChange XLII site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was used with the following mutagenic primers: 5′-GCGCGGGTCCCGGATCCTTGAGGCGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCGCCTCAAGGATCCGGGACCCGCGC-3′. The amplification cycles were as follows: 98 °C 3 min, 18 cycles (98 °C 50 s, 68 °C 17 min), 68 °C 7 min. A549 cells plated in six-well dishes were transfected using 3.75 μg/ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and 0.5 μg of either wild type or Sp1-mutated full p21 promoter construct. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 120 nm MG88 and MG208 for 24 h, and the luciferase activity was assayed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—A549 cells were treated with 120 nm MG88 and MG208 for 24 h or 48 h, or with 1 μm TSA for 6 h. Formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were washed and harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (Complete mini, Roche Applied Science), were pelleted, resuspended in 300 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Lysates were sonicated with six 10-s bursts. Debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) and incubated with 80 μl of agarose G mix (50% agarose G, 0.2 mg/ml sonicated herring sperm, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted for 5 min at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C. 100 μl of the supernatant was saved as input, and the rest was divided into equal aliquots and incubated by rocking with either no antibody (control), or with 10 μl of specific antibodies o/n at 4 °C. The following antibodies were used: antiacetylated histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology #06-599), antiacetylated histone H4 (Upstate Biotechnology #06–866), antidimethylhistone H3 (Lys-9) (Upstate Biotechnology #07-212), anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-59), and anti-Sp3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-644X). 60 μl of agarose G mix was added, and the samples were rocked for 2 h at 4 °C. The bead complexes were washed for 5 min at 4 °C with the following buffers: low salt (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and six washes of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Immune complexes were eluted twice with 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) for 15 min at room temperature. The input (volume adjusted to 500 μl with elution buffer) and combined eluates were de-cross-linked by adding 20 μl of 5 m NaCl and incubating for 4 h at 65 °C. EDTA, Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and proteinase K were then added to the final concentrations of 10 mm, 40 mm, and 0.1 μg/μl, respectively, and the samples were incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitated DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and was analyzed by PCR. For amplifying 255-bp region of p21 promoter, BIK promoter, and enhancer region of 4 × Sp1 luciferase reporter, PCR was performed in a 40-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl of ChIP product, 4 μl of 10 × PCR buffer with (NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 unit of Taq polymerase (all from MBI), and 0.2 μm of each primer. For the 324-bp region of the p21 promoter, and promoter and exon regions of HSPA2, the FailSafe PCR system (Epicenter) was used with pre-mixes D, A, and E (respectively), 0.5 μm of each primer, 0.5 μl of FailSafe polymerase, and 2 μl of ChIP product. The primer sequences and the amplification programs were as follows: p21 (324-bp region) (sense, 5′-ACCAACGCAGGCGAGGGACT-3′; antisense, 5′-CCGGCTCCACAAGGAACTGA-3′), 95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 64 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 62 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), 32 cycles (95 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min; p21 (255-bp region) (sense, 5′-GGTGTCTAGGTGCTCCAGGT-3′; antisense, 5′-GCACTCTCCAGGAGGACACA-3′), 95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 64 °C, 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 62 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), 32 cycles (95 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min; 4 × sp1 (sense, 5′-AGGTACCGAGCTCTTACGC-3′; antisense, 5′-CGCCGGGCCTTTCTTTATG-3′), 95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 58 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), 24 cycles (95 °C, 56 °C, and 72 °C 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min; BIK (sense, 5′-GCACACTCTTTGAACGCTG-3′; antisense, 5′-GCTACAAAGTGCAGCCCGTTG-3′) 95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 62 °C, 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), 32 cycles (95 °C, 58 °C, and 72 °C 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min; promoter of HSPA2 (sense, 5′-TGCTTGGTTCTCATTCTCTCT-3′; antisense, 5′-AGGTGTACCAGCATTTCAGC-3′), 95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 58 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), 32 cycles (95 °C, 56 °C, and 72 °C 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min; exon region of HSPA2 (sense, 5′-GGGGCAAGATTAGCGAGCAGGA-3′; antisense, 5′-TTCGATGGTGGGTCCCCCGGAG-3′), 95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 58 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), 32 cycles (95 °C, 56 °C, and 72 °C 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min. 20 μl of the PCR products was run on a 1.4% gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Densitometric analysis was performed using MCID software (Imaging Research Inc.).To assess the effect that Sp1 mutation might have on Sp1 occupancy of the p21 promoter in living cells, the wild type (–2326 p21) and Sp1-mutated (–2326 p21 CC→GA) p21 promoter luciferase reporter construct, were transiently transfected into A549 cells using 3.75 μg/ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μg/10 cm plate of the reporter construct. 48 h after transfection, the cells were cross-linked, and the chromatin was immunoprecipitated using 10 μg of Sp1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, #07-124) as described above. The precipitated wild type and Sp1-mutated reporter constructs were PCR-amplified using the same primers (sense, 5′-ACCAACGCAGGCGAGGGACT-3′; antisense, 5′-CGCCGGGCCTTTCTTTATG-3′). The 5′ primer corresponds to the bases between –256 and –236 of the p21 promoter, whereas the 3′ primer corresponds to the luciferase sequence. Thus our primers will selectively amplify the exogenous p21 promoter luciferase reporter and not the endogenous wild type p21 promoter. The FailSafe PCR system (Epicenter) was used with the pre-mix D, 0.5 μm of each primer, 0.5 μl of FailSafe polymerase, and 2 μl of ChIP product with the following program: 95 °C 5 min, one cycle (95 °C, 60 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), one cycle (95 °C, 58 °C, and 72 °C for 30 s each), 23 cycles (95 °C, 56 °C, and 72 °C 30 s each), 72 °C 5 min. 20 μl of the PCR products was run on a 1.4% gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometric analysis using MCID software (Imaging Research Inc.). The intensities of the p21-amplified bands immunoprecipitated with the anti-Sp1 antibody were normalized to the intensities of the bands amplified from the input material.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Compleme"
https://openalex.org/W2112415662,"Peptide presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules is of central importance for immune responses, which are triggered through recognition of peptide-loaded MHC molecules (pMHC) by cellular ligands such as T-cell receptors (TCR).

Peptidic fragments of self- or non-self-proteins are loaded on MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmatic reticulum, followed by transport to the cell surface. Recognition of these peptide-loaded MHC molecules (pMHC) by cellular ligands such as T-cell receptors (TCR) triggers an immune response. Despite their inherent cross-reactivity (2Mason D. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 395-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), TCR must be able to discriminate between foreign antigens and the huge number of self-peptides to avoid autoreactivity. The biological activity of T-cells has been correlated with pMHC-TCR binding kinetics (3Krogsgaard M. Prado N. Adams E.J. He X. Chow D. Wilson D.B. Garcia K.C. Davis M.M. Mol.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To solve this puzzle, a closer look at the underlying dynamical processes at the atomic level is mandatory (5Rudolph M.G. Luz J.G. Wilson I.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 6Housset D. Malissen B. Trends. Immunol. 2003; 24: 429-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To that aim, we have combined site-directed fluorescence labeling, picosecond time-resolved fluorescence depolarization, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Two human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I subtypes were compared, which are differentially associated with the autoimmune disease ankylosing spondylitis (AS). HLA-B*2705 and B*2709 differ only in one amino acid at position 116 at the floor of the peptide binding groove (Asp-116 in the AS-associated subtype B*2705 and His-116 in the B*2709 subtype, which lacks the AS association) (10Ramos M. López de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). High resolution x-ray structures of the soluble ectodomains of both subtypes in complex with the peptide m9 (GRFAAAIAK) have been determined previously and are virtually indistinguishable (11Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A. Ruhl M. Schroder W. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47844-47853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the dynamics of this peptide varies dramatically between the subtypes, and a pronounced peptide flexibility is seen only for one of the subtypes. The differential peptide flexibility explains the difference in the entropic component of the free energy between the subtypes at physiological temperature, suggesting an entropic control of peptide recognition. Additional thermodynamic data for two self-peptides support this hypothesis. Protein Preparation—Complexes of HLA-B27 with the model peptide m9, and the self-peptides TIS and pVIPR, were prepared as described previously (11Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A. Ruhl M. Schroder W. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47844-47853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The m9-C6-LY (GRFAAC(LY)IAK), TIS-C6-LY (RRLPI C(LY)SRL), and pVIPR-C8-LY (RRKWRRWC(LY)L) peptides were from Biosynthan. HLA complexes were refolded from 6 m urea in the presence of the respective peptide. After size exclusion chromatography, the concentrations of the HLA-B27:peptide complexes in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl were adjusted for the experiments using the absorption band of Lucifer Yellow (λmax = 426 ± 2 nm) to A426 = 0.02 OD. The fluorescence emission maximum of Lucifer Yellow covalently bound to the peptides is λmax = 532 ± 1 nm. Time-resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The fluorescence anisotropy decays were measured employing a tunable Ti:sapphire laser/microchannel plate based single-photon counting apparatus with picosecond time resolution (12Alexiev U. Rimke I. Pöhlmann T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The fluorescence decay profiles (I∥(t) and I⊥(t)) and the time-resolved anisotropy as given by the following equation, r(t)=I∥(t)−I⊥(t)I∥(t)+2I⊥(t) were analyzed using the software package Global Unlimited V2.2 (Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, University of Illinois). The time course of the fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S1) was fitted with a sum of exponentials (Equation 2). I(t)=∑i=1αie−t/τi (Eq. 2) The anisotropy decay was fitted with the model function (Equation 3). r(t)=∑i=1nβie−t/ϕi (Eq. 3) The instrumental response function of the system was ∼40 ps (FWHM) at a channel width of 5 ps. Thermally Induced Peptide Dissociation and HLA-B27 Complex Unfolding—The mole fraction of bound peptide molecules and the fraction of peptides free in solution were monitored directly by steady-state anisotropy, as the fluorescence quantum yield of the attached fluoro-phore did not change upon peptide binding for m9-C6-LY (supplemental Fig. S2). For pVIPR, the fluorescence quantum yield of Lucifer Yellow changes upon peptide dissociation and the change in fluorescence intensity was used to follow peptide dissociation. The anisotropy data were fitted to the following equation using the least square method assuming a two-state transition (13Eftink M.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 482-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), r=r0b+sbT+[r0d+sdT]exp((−ΔHp0+TΔSp0)/RT)1+exp((−ΔHp0+TΔSp0)/RT) (Eq. 4) with Tm=ΔHp0/ΔSp0. This equation involves six fitting parameters, the fluorescence anisotropy of the peptide in the bound state, r0b, and of the peptide in the unbound state, r0d, at the reference temperature, the temperature dependence of the polarization of the peptide bound state, sb, and of the peptide unbound state, sd, the enthalpy change, ΔH0p, and the entropy change, ΔS0p, for the two state unfolding reaction. r0d and sd were determined from the temperature dependence of the peptide free in solution. Tm is the transition temperature. HLA-B27 complex unfolding was followed by the change in the tryptophan fluorescence intensity at the blue (320 nm) and red (360 nm) side of the tryptophan emission band. Tm was determined from the first derivatives of the denaturation curves. Comparison of the Tm from tryptophan fluorescence with the Tm for unfolding determined by CD (14Hillig R.C. Hülsmeyer M. Saenger W. Welfle K. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Kozerski C. Volz A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 652-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) shows a good agreement for B*2705:m9 (CD: ∼63 °C) and for B*2709:m9 (CD: ∼49 °C), indicating that the modification with Lucifer Yellow does not change the thermodynamic properties of the respective complex. Molecular Dynamics Simulations—As start structures, HLA-B*2709 and HLA-B*2705 subtypes complexed with m9 were taken (Protein Data Bank entries 1K5N and 1JGE at 1.09 Å and 2.10 Å, respectively (11Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A. Ruhl M. Schroder W. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47844-47853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). The simulations were performed in a periodic box (8.9 × 8.3 × 10.0 nm); the structures were solvated with 21,904 and 22,406 TIP4 (15Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30918) Google Scholar) water molecules, corresponding to a water shell thickness of at least 1.4 nm around the protein, adding up to simulation sizes of more than 94,000 atoms (supplemental Fig. S3). Na+Cl– ions (150 mm) were added to the simulation systems with access Na+ ions to compensate for the net negative charge of the MHC molecules. The OPLS all-atom forcefield was applied (16Kaminski G. Friesner R.A. Tirado-Rives J. Jorgensen W.L. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 6474-6487Crossref Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). All MD simulations were carried out using the Gromacs simulation suite (17Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). Application of the Lincs (18Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C. Fraije J.G.E.M. J.Phys. Comp. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Google Scholar) and Settle (19Miyamoto S. Kollman P.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1992; 13: 952-962Crossref Scopus (5409) Google Scholar) methods allowed for an integration step size of 2 fs. Short range electrostatic interactions (distance <1 nm) between charge groups were calculated explicitly, and long range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle-Mesh Ewald Method (20Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21714) Google Scholar). The systems were coupled to an external temperature bath (21Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (24191) Google Scholar) of 310 K with a coupling time constant of τT = 0.01 ps separately for the protein and the solvent (including ions). The pressure was kept constant by a weak coupling to a pressure bath (21Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (24191) Google Scholar) with τP = 1 ps. Each simulation started with an energy minimization using a steepest descent algorithm (1000 steps) and was followed by simulations of 100-ps length with harmonic position restraints applied on all heavy protein atoms (force constant: 1000 kJ/mol/nm2) to allow relaxation of the solvent molecules. Estimation of Peptide Entropy from MD Simulation—The entropy of the m9 peptide bound to the MHC is estimated based on a quasi-harmonic approximation of the absolute entropy (22Schlitter J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1993; 215: 617-621Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The entropy S = –kB〈lnρ〉 with the probability distribution ρ for a harmonic oscillator is shown to yield an upper bound for the true entropy of the system. The generalization for many degrees of freedom reads S=kBγeγ−1−kBln(1−e−γ) with γ=hβ2πσ where σ denotes the mass-weighted covariance matrix, σik=mimk〈(xi−〈xi〉)(xk−〈xk〉)〉 which is computed from the MD trajectories. The dynamics and motional freedom of the bound m9 peptide, as well as the thermodynamic stability of the two differentially autoimmune disease-associated HLA-B27-subtypes B*2705 and B*2709 complexed with m9, were probed by time-resolved fluorescence depolarization using the fluorescent reporter group Lucifer Yellow iodoacetamide (LYIA) covalently bound to a cysteine introduced at position 6 of the m9 peptide (m9-C6-LY). Rotational correlation times of peptide motion were extracted from time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decays (Fig. 1, A–C, and supplemental Table S1). The anisotropy decay of the fluorescent peptide complexed with the HLA-B27 subtypes at 20 °C (Fig. 1B) can be best fitted by three correlation times, one reflecting the motion of the fluorescent dye (∼0.2 ns), a 2-ns component assigned to the bound peptide (described below), and a longer correlation time (∼17 ns) corresponding to the rotational motion of the whole complex. The fastest rotational correlation time (0.2 ns) agrees well with the rotational correlation time of Lucifer Yellow in solution (0.14 ns) (Fig. 1A). The size of the molecule estimated from the viscosity dependence of the slowest rotational correlation time under the assumption of a spherical rotator yields an effective hydrodynamic diameter of d = 57 ± 3 Å for both subtypes, in very good agreement with the average diameter of about 60 Å obtained from the crystal structures (Fig. 1D) (11Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A. Ruhl M. Schroder W. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47844-47853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This result suggests that under our experimental conditions B*2705 and B*2709 complexes exist in a monomeric rather than in an oligomeric form (23Gakamsky D.M. Haas E. Robbins P. Strominger J.L. Pecht I. Immunol. Lett. 1995; 44: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The assignment of the fastest and slowest of the three rotational correlation times to the motion of the fluorescent dye itself and the whole complex, respectively, leaves only the 2-ns component (at 20 °C) for the dynamics of the peptide. This correlation time is slower than the rotational correlation time of the peptide free in solution (0.64 ± 0.03 ns; Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1), likely due to interaction with the binding groove. At 20 °C no significant difference was seen between the two subtypes (Fig. 1B). However, the respective peptide dynamics shows pronounced differences at physiological temperature (Fig. 1C). Specifically, the peptide in the binding groove of the HLA-B*2709 subtype is more flexible than in B*2705:m9 as evidenced by the faster rotational correlation time of the peptide component with ϕ2 = 1.1 ± 0.2 ns (B*2709:m9-C6-LY) compared with ϕ2 = 1.60 ± 0.03 ns (B*2705:m9-C6-LY). To obtain an atomistic interpretation of the measured enhanced mobility of the peptide we performed extended MD simulations of B*2705 and B*2709 with bound m9 (Fig. 2). Indeed, the m9 peptide displays a dramatically enhanced flexibility when bound to B*2709, as can be seen from representative snapshots of the m9 conformations (Fig. 1, E and G). The different conformational ensembles sampled by the peptide in the simulations are depicted in Fig. 2. Whereas the conformational bundle is narrow in B*2705 (Fig. 2A, top), the simulations yield an exceptionally broad distribution of m9 conformations in the B*2709 subtype (Fig. 2B, top). The subtype-dependent conformational heterogeneity increases toward the C terminus of the peptide (compare Fig. 2, top), with main chain atoms of pLys-9 and pAla-8 showing deviations of up to 7 Å around the B*2709 x-ray conformation, whereas the corresponding value for B*2705 is less than 2 Å (Fig. 2, bottom). Thus, in the simulations at 310 K, the peptide bound to B*2709 gets partially untrapped at the C terminus. This contrasts with the small deviations (maximum 0.6 Å) of peptide residues between the crystal structures of the two subtypes, which were, however, obtained at 100 K (11Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A. Ruhl M. Schroder W. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47844-47853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Unlike the C terminus, the primary anchor residue pArg-2, which is common among HLA-B27 subtypes, remains tightly bound in both simulations. The increase in peptide flexibility can be quantified by the root mean square fluctuations. The root mean square fluctuation of pAla-6 (Fig. S4), the attachment position of the fluorescent dye, is 1.24 ± 0.05 Å in B*2709:m9, compared with 0.71 ± 0.03 Å in B*2705:m9, when averaging over 1-ns trajectory sections. Fig. 1E shows three representative conformations of the B*2709-bound m9 peptide (blue, occupation (oc) 66%; green, occupation 25%; and red, occupation 9%) sampled in the simulation (Fig. 2B), derived from a principal component analysis (24Amadei A. Linssen A.B.M. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1993; 17: 412-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2705) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1F), and the crystal conformation found in B*2709:m9 (gray). In addition to the large shift in the C-terminal pLys-9 with respect to the crystal conformation, we identified two conformations for pPhe-3 (Fig. 1e, blue/red and green). However, the salt bridge of pLys-9 to Asp-77 of the α1-helix is only broken for one of the three peptide conformations (Fig. 1E, red). This conformation is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between pAla-6 and Gln-155. In addition, a hydrogen bond between Lys-146 and the carboxyl oxygen of pLys-9 is retained. Thereby, pLys-9 imposes an increased flexibility also on the N-terminal part of the α2-helix (residues 137–150). A higher mobility of this domain is also seen in simulations of peptide-free HLA-B27 subtypes (data not shown) and in a normal mode analysis of peptide-free HLA-A2 molecules (25Nojima H. Takeda-Shitaka M. Kurihara Y. Kamiya K. Umeyama H. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 51: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This suggests that the flexibility of the α2-helix in B*2705:m9 is restricted by firm anchoring of the pLys-9 side chain to the floor of the binding groove (Asp-116). This type of anchoring cannot be realized between pLys-9 and His-116 in B*2709:m9, which contributes to the observed flexibility. Several residues in the α2-helix including Lys-146 are highly conserved among HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens (26Reche P.A. Reinherz E.L. J. Mol.

The different flexibilities of the peptide and its binding grooves, as seen both in the simulations and in the time-resolved experiments, explain the measured entropy changes for the thermally induced peptide dissociation (Fig. 3A). Assuming a two-state reaction, the steady-state anisotropy data in Fig. 3A yield the enthalpy change, ΔH0, and entropy change, ΔS0, for peptide unbinding (Table I). The transition temperatures for m9 dissociation with 46 ± 2 °C (B*2709) and 65 ± 1 °C(B*2705) (Fig. 3, A and B, and Table I), match those of the unfolding of the whole complex as deduced from the change in fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan emission band (Fig. 3B). The second peak observed for B*2709:m9 (Fig. 3B) is due to β2m unfolding (14Hillig R.C. Hülsmeyer M. Saenger W. Welfle K. Misselwitz R. Welfle H. Kozerski C. Volz A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A.

Open table in a new tab This difference in entropy is further explained by the simulations, from which the entropic contribution of the peptide was estimated using a quasi-harmonic approximation (22Schlitter J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1993; 215: 617-621Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In the non-disease-associated B*2709 subtype, the entropic energy of m9 at physiological temperature is higher than in B*2705 by TΔS = 175 kJ/mol (Fig. 3C), which is about 60% of the measured change. We attribute the remaining 40% of the loss in entropy upon peptide binding to the peptide-induced immobilization of the binding groove. These results suggest an entropic control of peptide presentation. In particular, our study shows that virtually identical pMHC crystal structures (11Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A. Ruhl M. Schroder W. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47844-47853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) can exhibit drastic HLA subtype-dependent dynamical differences, even though the subtypes are distinguished only by a deeply buried polymorphism. This differential flexibility of the HLA-B27 subtypes is due to a complex interplay between residue 116 polymorphism and the peptide displayed (Figs. 1C and 2 and Table I). It is tempting to speculate that also the binding of TCR or other ligands on an effector cell to a pMHC must at least partly be controlled by the observed pMHC flexibility, influencing effector cell responses (3Krogsgaard M. Prado N. Adams E.J. He X. Chow D. Wilson D.B. Garcia K.C. Davis M.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1367-1378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To test this entropic control hypothesis, we obtained thermodynamic data also for two additional peptides, TIS (RRLPIFSRL) and pVIPR (RRKWRRWHL) (28Fiorillo M.T. Greco G. Maragno M. Potolicchio I. Monizio A. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2508-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Fiorillo M.T. Maragno M. Butler R. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Strikingly, for both LY-labeled self-peptides the change in entropy upon peptide dissociation from B*2709 is close to that for m9, whereas for the disease-associated subtype B*2705 the entropy changes are peptide-dependent (Table I). The increased thermal stability of B*2705:pVIPR compared with B*2709:pVIPR is in agreement with the recently resolved crystal structures of B*2705:pVIPR and B*2709:pVIPR (30Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which show two distinct conformations of pVIPR. The non-conventional p6α conformation with an additional salt bridge between pArg-5 and Asp-116 was only observed for B*2705:pVIPR, suggesting an increased stability of this complex with respect to B*2709:pVIPR. As the entropy changes for B*2705 are never smaller than the corresponding values for B*2709, they imply MHC polymorphism-linked entropic thresholds, which distinguish peptide presentation by the two subtypes (Table I and Fig. 3). In the case of HLA-B27, the existence of such entropic thresholds between the disease-associated and the non-associated subtype (Table I and Fig. 3) points to a possible connection with AS pathogenesis through differential development of HLA-B27-restricted T-cell repertoires in B*2705- and B*2709-positive individuals (29Fiorillo M.T. Maragno M. Butler R. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 30Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Distinct repertoires against the self-peptide pVIPR have already been shown to exist in individuals with B*2705 or B*2709, respectively (29Fiorillo M.T. Maragno M. Butler R. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). pVIPR evokes a specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response that is higher in B*2705-positive AS patients than in healthy B*2705 controls, while such CTL responses have so far not been found in persons who are positive for B*2709. Subtype-dependent differential peptide dynamics might also be connected to the pathogenesis of other disease states. For example, the rate of progression to AIDS in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients (31Gao X. Nelson G.W. Karacki P. Martin M.P. Phair J. Kaslow R. Goedert J.J. Buchbinder S. Hoots K. Vlahov D. O'Brien S.J. Carrington M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) or the outcome of bone marrow transplants between unrelated individuals (32Ferrara G.B. Bacigalupo A. Lamparelli T. Lanino E. Delfino L. Morabito A. Parodi A.M. Pera C. Pozzi S. Sormani M.P. Bruzzi P. Bordo D. Bolognesi M. Bandini G. Bontadini A. Barbanti M. Frumento G. Blood. 2001; 98: 3150-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) are both associated with residue 116 polymorphism. Thus, the dissection of the subtype-dependent peptide flexibilities provides a dynamical frame-work for unraveling the link between a class I molecule, e.g. HLA-B27, and autoimmune diseases. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the bound peptide and surrounding heavy chain residues in class I molecules exhibit a wide range of flexibilities, which are linked to MHC polymorphism. Enhanced peptide flexibilities, however, do not necessarily influence peptide binding affinities (33de Haan E.C. Wauben M.H.M. Grosfeld-Stulemeyer M.C. Kruijtzer J.A.W. Liskamp R.M.J. Moret E.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that peptide residues are mainly involved in pMHC-TCR complex stabilization, allowing efficient T-cell activation (34Wu L.C. Tuot D.S. Lyons D.S. Garcia K.C. Davis M.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 553-556Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, an optimal dwell-time range for the interaction of TCR and pMHC is crucial as well (3Krogsgaard M. Prado N. Adams E.J. He X.

In addition, a role of entropic effects for TCR binding has been assumed (35Willcox B.E. Gao G.F. Wyer J.R. Ladbury J.E. Bell J.I. Jakobson B.K. van der Merve P.A.

Our results, however, demonstrate that also the bound peptide and surrounding heavy chain residues may exhibit pronounced flexibility. By entropically contributing to ligand binding and unbinding kinetics, the degree of pMHC flexibility can in particular control optimal T-cell recognition and activation via the half-life of the pMHC-TCR interaction (3Krogsgaard M.

https://openalex.org/W2036503829,"It is widely thought that myogenin is one of the earliest detectable markers of skeletal muscle differentiation. Here we show that, during human myoblast differentiation, an inward rectifier K(+) channel (Kir2.1) and its associated hyperpolarization trigger expression and activity of the myogenic transcription factors, myogenin and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2). Furthermore, Kir2.1 current precedes and is required for the developmental increase in expression/activity of myogenin and MEF2. Drugs or antisense reducing Kir2.1 current diminished or suppressed fusion as well as expression/activity of myogenin and MEF2. In contrast, LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (a pathway controlling initiation of the myogenic program) that inhibited both myogenin/MEF2 expression and fusion, did not affect Kir2.1 current. This non-blockade by LY294002 indicates that Kir2.1 acts upstream of myogenin and MEF2. We propose that Kir2.1 channel activation is a required key early event that initiates myogenesis by turning on myogenin and MEF2 transcription factors via a hyperpolarization-activated Ca(2+)-dependent pathway."

The interaction between rat ALP and α-actinin 2 has been reported to be mediated via the PDZ domain and the spectrin repeats of α-actinin 2 (10Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J.

To better understand how ALP functions, we have characterized its interaction sites with α-actinin in more detail. Here we show that there are the two interaction sites between human skeletal muscle ALP and α-actinin 2. ALP PDZ domain recognized the C terminus of α-actinin 2, whereas the ZM motif was required for ALP interaction with the rod region of α-actinin. Moreover, we show that the ZM motif was necessary for the recruitment of ALP to the Z-lines in cultured myoblasts. The two interaction sites suggest that ALP may regulate actin filament cross-linking by stabilizing the hinge region between the head and rod regions of α-actinin. Generation of Human ALP, CLP36, and α-Actinin 2 Constructs—A cDNA of human skeletal muscle ALP corresponding the full-length protein (amino acids 1–364) (AF039018) was amplified from the human skeletal muscle cDNA library (Matchmaker, BD Biosciences, Clontech). This was used as a template to generate shorter fragments of ALP. A plasmid containing full-length human CLP36 (11Vallenius T. Luukko K. Mäkelä T.P. J. Biol.

ALP and CLP36 fragments were cloned in a modified pET24d vector (Novagen, Merck Biosciences, Schwalbach, Germany). All inserts in the modified pET24d vector contained an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site (27Parks T.D. Leuther K.K. Howard E.D. Johnston S.A. Dougherty W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and three extra residues (ENLYFQ↓GAMG, ↓ denotes the tobacco etch virus cleavage site). Full human α-actinin 2A (M86406) (28Young P. Gautel M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6331-6340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in modified pET8c (Novagen) vector (described in Djinovic-Carugo et al.

C-terminally GFP-tagged ALP constructs were generated in pELGFP vector (a gift from Michael Way, Cancer Research UK, London, UK (29Frischknecht F. Moreau V. Rottger S. Gonfloni S. Reckmann I.

Fragments of chicken smooth muscle ALP (AJ249218, full-length cDNA was a gift from M. Beckerle, Salt Lake City, UT) were also generated in pEGFP-C1 vector. To generate Myc-tagged constructs, a PCR fragment containing an EcoRI restriction site, Myc-epitope sequence (EQKLISEEDL), and BsmBI and NotI restriction sites was amplified by PCR and introduced to pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Constructs used in this study are shown in Table I. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.

Synthesized peptide was eluted from 4-hydroxymethylphenoxymethyl polystyrene resin (Applied Biosystems) using trifluoroacetic acid and further ether-precipitated and lyophilized. The purity of the peptide was 95%, and the molecular mass was 1041 as expected. Protein Expression and Purification—Protein expression was induced in +37 °C for 3–4 h in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. An N-terminal His6 tag was used for protein purification by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The tag was removed by tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) cleavage either in overnight dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at +4 °C, or buffer was changed using PD10 columns (Amersham Biosciences), and proteolysis was performed overnight at 23 °C. Anion exchange chromatography (ProteinPakQ 8HR columns, Waters) was used for further purification. Size exclusion chromatography was performed in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, using Superdex 200 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). The molecular weight standards for the gel filtration were from Bio-Rad (catalog number 151-1901). Surface Plasmon Resonance Detection—Biacore 3000 system (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) was used for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Purified protein fragments of ALP and CLP36 were covalently bound from their amino groups to the gold sensor chip surface (CM5) and used as ligand proteins. α-Actinin fragments were used as analyte proteins in the fluid phase, with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20 (BR-1000–54, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as the running buffer. The Biaevaluation (Biacore) program, assuming 1:1 Langmuir binding, was used for kinetic calculations. SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins used in Biacore is shown in Fig. 1A. Low molecular weight marker was from Amersham Biosciences. Filamentous Actin (F-actin) Sedimentation Assay—Monomeric actin (Cytoskeleton Inc, Denver, CO) was polymerized in the general polymerization buffer (1 mm ATP, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, according to Cytoskeleton Inc.) but in the absence of divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) and in the presence of 5 mm EDTA. Polymerization was allowed to continue for 30 min at 23 °C. Purified full-length α-actinin 2 (1 μm) and ALP PDZ+I (3.8 μm) were added to the reaction and mixed carefully. After 30 min of incubation the samples were ultracentrifuged (90,000 rpm, 30 min, +18 °C, TLA100 rotor, Beckman Coulter, Buckinghamshire, UK), and supernatants and pellets were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Intensities of protein bands were quantified using the QuantityOne program (Bio-Rad). Results of three experiments were used in GraFit 5.0.6 (Erithacus Software Ltd.) to calculate Kd values for α-actinin and F-actin interaction. The molar ratio of ALP PDZ+I and α-actinin 2 in pellet fractions in increasing concentrations of actin (0–10 μm) was calculated using formula, molar ratio of ALP PDZ+I/α-actinin 2 = (SC - S0 - (UC - U0))/(AC - A0), where S denotes specific ALP pelleting, U is unspecific ALP pelleting, A denotes α-actinin 2 pelleting, SC is mol of ALP pelleting in a given actin concentration in constant α-actinin 2 concentration, S0 is mol of ALP pelleting in the absence of actin in constant α-actinin 2 concentration, UC is mol of ALP pelleting in given actin concentration without α-actinin 2, U0 is mol of ALP pelleting in the absence of actin and without α-actinin 2, AC is mol of α-actinin 2 pelleting in given actin concentration in constant ALP concentration, and A0 is mol of α-actinin 2 pelleting in the absence of actin in constant ALP concentration. In the calculations α-actinin 2 was assumed to be a dimer (Mr = 207,800) and ALP PDZ+I a monomer (Mr = 30,400). Transfection of CHO and C2C12 Cells—Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO-K1) cells (ATCC CCL-61, American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm l-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (DMEM, FBS, and supplements were from Cambrex Bioscience, Verviers, Belgium). CHO cells were transfected at 90–95% confluence on 6-well plates using 4 μg of DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) per well in the absence of serum and antibiotics for 6 h. Serum-containing media was added to cells for overnight incubation. 24 h after transfection cells were plated on coverslips coated with 30 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). After 4 h cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, and 0.5% Triton X-100 on ice for 10 min and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Mouse myogenic cells C2C12 (ATCC, CRL-1772) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.15% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich). Undifferentiated C2C12 cells were cultured on coverslips and transfected when 50–60% confluent using 4 μg of DNA and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 per well in a 6-well plate. During transfection no FBS or antibiotics were added to culture media. Media was changed to DMEM with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.15% sodium bicarbonate 6 h after transfection. The next day media was changed to DMEM, 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.15% sodium bicarbonate, and antibiotics. After 4–6 h the media was changed to differentiation media: DMEM, 2% horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, antibiotics, and 0.15% sodium bicarbonate. Cells were allowed to differentiate for 5 days. Differentiation media was changed at least twice. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, on ice for 10 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Antibodies—Actin fibers were stained with 0.004 units/ml rhodamine-phalloidin (R-415, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) 30 min at 23 °C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated c-Myc 9E10 antibody (sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) was used to detect the localization of Myc-tagged proteins. Sarcomeric α-actinin was stained using sarcomeric α-actinin-specific antibody (A7811, Sigma-Aldrich) as a primary antibody and TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as a secondary (115–025-075, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Vinculin was stained using VIIF9 primary antibody (30Glukhova M.A. Frid M.G. Koteliansky V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13042-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as a secondary antibody. ALP and α-Actinin 2 Have Two Interaction Sites—To clarify the conflicting literature about the interactions between PDZ-LIM proteins and α-actinin (see the Introduction for references), we studied the interaction of purified recombinant protein fragments by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We found that the PDZ domains of ALP (amino acids 1–84) and CLP36 (amino acids 1–85) interacted with the C-terminal EF-hands (EF3-4) of human α-actinin 2 (Table II). The C terminus of α-actinin 2 contains the sequence ESDL, which fits with the consensus ligand sequence of group I PDZ domains (S/T)XΦ-COOH (X is any amino acid, Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid) (for review, see Ref. 13Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion of this sequence from the EF3-4 fragment abolished the interaction, and a synthetic peptide containing the sequence of the last 10 residues of α-actinin 2 (SSALYGESDL) inhibited the interaction in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The apparent Kd values for the interaction of ALP PDZ-(1–84) and CLP36 PDZ-(1–85) with EF3-4 were 8.6 μm (S.E. ± 1.02 μm) and 15.0 μm (S.E. ± 0.62 μm), respectively.Table IISummary of SPR interaction resultsProteinα-Actinin 2 2-894ΔEF3-4 2-820R1-R4 274-746EF3-4 821-894EF3-4ΔC 821-890C-peptide 885-894ALP PDZ+I, 1-284++++-NTaNT, not testedCLP36 PDZ+I, 1-256++++-NTALP I, 112-284+++--NTCLP I, 117-256+++--NTALP PDZ, 1-84+bMeasured by competitive assay--+-+bMeasured by competitive assayCLP PDZ, 1-85+bMeasured by competitive assay--+-+bMeasured by competitive assayCLP PDZ, 1-119+--+-NTALP PDZ+ZM, 1-232NTNT++NTNTa NT, not testedb Measured by competitive assay Open table in a new tab Although we could measure the interaction of ALP and CLP36 PDZ domains with the EF3-4 fragments, we could not directly show their interaction with the full-length α-actinin 2. To test whether this was caused by steric hindrance on the SPR surface, we tested the interaction with longer PDZ domain constructs. CLP36 PDZ-(1–119) interacted with the full-length α-actinin 2 (Table II) but not with the full-length α-actinin lacking the last two EF-hands (ΔEF3-4, Table II). Size exclusion chromatography confirmed that the recombinant full-length α-actinin 2 (not shown) and ΔEF3-4 proteins were dimers (Fig. 1B). In competitive assays, the short ALP PDZ-(1–84) and CLP36 PDZ-(1–85) inhibited the interaction of CLP36 PDZ-(1–119) with the full-length α-actinin 2 (Fig. 2B), although the inhibition by ALP PDZ-(1–84) was weaker when compared with CLP36 PDZ-(1–85). Thus, our results showed that the PDZ domains of ALP and CLP36 interact with the C-terminal peptide of α-actinin 2. In addition to the interaction mediated by the PDZ domains, the internal regions (named I) of ALP and CLP36 interacted with the rod region α-actinin 2 (Fig. 2C and Table II). In this study we used the rod fragment composed of four spectrin repeats that form a stable dimer (2Ylänne J. Scheffzek K. Young P. Saraste M. Structure (Camb). 2001; 9: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and should not contain exposed hydrophobic surfaces. SPR experiments revealed apparent Kd values of 6.8 μm (S.E. ± 0.82 μm) and 1.3 μm (S.E. ± 0.03 μm) for the internal regions of ALP I (residues 112–284) and CLP36 I (residues 117–256), respectively. We hypothesized that ZM motif might be involved in the internal recognition of the rod region because this motif is present both in ALP and CLP36. Indeed, ALP PDZ+ZM-(1–232) interacted with the rod region of α-actinin 2 (Fig. 2D; Table II). Taken together, our SPR results suggested that there are two interaction sites between these PDZ-LIM proteins and α-actinin 2. The PDZ domains interact with the C terminus of α-actinin, and the ZM motif in the internal region of ALP is involved in the interaction with the rod region of α-actinin. ALP Does Not Affect the Ability of α-Actinin 2 to Bind F-actin—After finding the two interaction sites we wanted to see if the binding of ALP would affect the ability of α-actinin 2 to bind F-actin. To avoid the effects of Zn2+ binding LIM domain in actin polymerization, ALP PDZ+I (residues 1–284), containing the PDZ domain and the internal region, was used in this assay. Still, this protein had a tendency to nonspecifically sediment with F-actin, but this could be avoided by per"

Here we report the isolation of a human cDNA encoding a DNA sequence-specific binding protein with significant homology to the transcription factor YY1. A sequence analysis of this novel protein, YY2, revealed an overall 65% identity in the DNA sequence and a 56% identity in protein sequence compared with human YY1. The most pronounced similarity between YY1 and YY2 exists within the zinc finger regions of the two proteins, and consistent with this observation, YY2 can bind to and regulate some promoters known to be controlled by YY1. Similar to YY1, YY2 contains both transcriptional activation and repression functions. The finding of a protein with structure and function similar to YY1 provides a new opportunity to explore additional mechanisms by which YY1-responsive genes can be regulated and suggests that gene regulation by YY1 is far more complicated than previously assumed.

Early investigations firmly established that YY1 activates or represses the transcription of many different genes, and recent studies are beginning to uncover the biological functions and the underlying mechanisms of YY1 action. For example, we now know that the targeted disruption of YY1 in mice results in peri-implantation lethality, thus arguing that YY1 is essential for mouse embryo development (16Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In vivo studies in Drosophila show that YY1 functions as a polycomb group protein that maintains transcriptional repression patterns during embryogenesis (15Atchison L. Ghias A. Wilkinson F. Bonini N. Atchison M.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). YY1 also participates in checkpoint functions that regulate cell cycle transitions in differentiated cells (17Petkova V. Romanowski M.J. Sulijoadikusumo I. Rohne D. Kang P. Shenk T. Usheva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7932-7936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). YY1 is overexpressed in failing human hearts and in a transgenic mouse model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (18Sucharov C.C. Mariner P. Long C. Bristow M. Leinwand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31233-31239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Additionally, YY1 is a component of a repressor complex that binds to a chromosomal repeat that is deleted in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (19Gabellini D. Green M.R. Tupler R. Cell. 2002; 110: 339-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). A chief mechanism by which YY1 activates and represses transcription is the interaction with cellular transcription factors including TBP, TAFs, TFIIB, and Sp1 (7Austen M. Luscher B.

Alternatively, although not mutually exclusively, YY1 recruits histone modification enzymes including p300, HDACs, and PRMT1 to regulate transcription (24Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 25Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is estimated that >7% of all vertebrate gene promoters contain at least one YY1 consensus-binding site (27Hyde-DeRuyscher R.P. Jennings E. Shenk T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, YY1 potentially controls the expression of a vast array of genes ranging from those that are important in basic cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and cell cycle control to genes that are directly linked to the immune response, cancer, viral infections, and development (28Shi Y. Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 29Thomas M.J. Seto E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Proteins that occupy a critical role in the cell often occur in multiple homologous yet distinct forms. Many transcription factors, once thought to exist as a single member, are now known to belong to a family of proteins. For example, several highly conserved proteins homologous to one of the first and best characterized DNA-binding transcription factors, Sp1, exist in humans (30Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 31Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, DNA-control elements such as AP1- and cAMP-response element-binding sites located in the promoters and enhancers of many eukaryotic genes bind families of multiple transcription factors (34Kouzarides T. Ziff E. Cancer Cells. 1989; 1: 71-76PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hai T.W. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Here we report that, similar to Sp1 and many other human DNA sequence-specific binding transcription factors, YY1 also exists in a family of more than one protein. Using DNA and amino acid sequence data base analysis, we discovered that at least one protein with a structure and functions similar to those of YY1 (hereafter designated YY2) is present in humans. As determined by Northern blot analysis, YY2 is derived from multiple mRNAs with a predominant transcript of ∼7.3 kb. YY2 migrates as a protein of ∼58 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and is expressed in multiple tissues. In gel shift assays, YY2 binds specifically to a YY1-consensus sequence and to some, but not all, promoter sequences previously shown to interact with YY1. Deletion analysis of a Gal4-YY2 fusion protein indicates that YY2 contains both activation and repression domains. Finally, using overexpression and siRNA 1The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interference RNA; Luc, luciferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; RT, reverse transcription. technology, we show that YY2 activates a number of promoters previously demonstrated to be responsive to YY1. Our results suggest that YY2 is intimately involved in the regulation of genes previously known to be controlled by YY1. Cell Culture—HeLa and U2OS cells in monolayer were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Identification and cDNA Cloning of YY2—The NCBI BLASTP program was used to search for proteins with a similarity to YY1. Several human clones that potentially encode proteins with significant homology to YY1 were found, and primers were designed to amplify one of the cDNA clones (AK091850). For reverse transcription, poly(A+) RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using the Qiagen poly(A) kit according to the manufacturer's suggestion. After DNase I treatment, 100 ng of poly(A+) mRNA was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a 50-μl reaction mixture that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.20 mm dNTPs, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, 200 units/μl avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, and 20 pmol of a synthetic primer (5′-TCTAGTCACGGGTTGTTTTTGGTC3-′). The cDNA product then was amplified with forward (5′-ATGGCCTCCAACGAAGAT-3′) and reverse (5′-TCTAGTCACGGGTTGTTTTTGGTC-3′) primers. The PCR was performed at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The last cycle was extended at 72 °C for 7 min. The final product was purified, subcloned into a pCR-TOPO-4 vector, and verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids—pGST-YY1, pHis-YY1, pGal4tk-Luc, p53-Luc, pcMyc-Luc, pcFos-Luc, and pCXCR4-Luc have been described previously (2Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2359-2366PubMed Google Scholar). pcDNA3-YY2 was engineered by inserting an EcoRI/XbaI YY2 fragment from pCR-TOPO4-YY2 into a pcDNA3.1FLAG vector downstream and in-frame with the FLAG epitope. For pET-YY2, the PCR product generated from pCR-TOPO4-YY2 with primers 5′-CATATGATTCCGGTGTCGCTG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCGGGTTGTTTTTGGT-3′ was purified, digested with NdeI/BamHI, and ligated into a pET16b vector (Novagen). The same approach was used to construct pET-YY2-(1-167) with primers 5′-CATATGATTCCGGTGTCGCTG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCGTGCCCAG-3′. pGal4-YY2 was constructed by subcloning the full-length YY2 fragment from pcDNA3-YY2 into the pM1 vector (39Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), such that YY2 would be expressed as a fusion protein in-frame and downstream of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Plasmids that express different Gal4-YY2 C-terminal deletions, pGal4-YY2-(1-33), pGal4-YY2-(1-102), and pGal4-YY2-(1-239), were produced using pGal4-YY2 linearized with BamHI/PstI followed by treatment with ExoIII/S1 and religation. pGal4-YY2-(1-195), pGal4-YY2-(1-291), and pGal4-YY2-(237-372) were constructed by isolating fragments from pGal4-YY2 digested with EcoRI/StyI, EcoRI/HindIII, and AcsI/XbaI, respectively, and ligating them into the pM1 vector digested with EcoRI/XbaI, EcoRI/HindIII, and EcoRI/XbaI, respectively. pGal4-YY2-(32-102) was constructed by inserting a PCR product, generated with pGal4-YY2 as a template and primers 5′-GGAATTCATGGAGGACATTCCGACG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACTCCAAGTCGTTGCCTA-3′, into the pM1 vector. Similarly, pGal4-YY2-(232-292) was generated with primers 5′-GGAATTCCCTAAACAGCTGGCAGA-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAAAAGCTTTGCCACATTC-3′. For pGST-YY2, the primers were 5′-CGGGATCCTGGCCTCCAACGAAGAT-3′ and 5′-TCCCCCGGGTACCCGGGTTGTTTTTG-3′ and the PCR product was subcloned into the BamHI/SmaI sites of pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). To construct pBS/U6-YY2, oligonucleotides (5′-GGCTATTGCGACTCAGACAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTGTCTGAGTCGCAATAGCC-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 264-285 of the YY2 cDNA were first inserted into the BS/U6 vector (40Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) that had been digested with ApaI and HindIII. The inverted repeat (5′-AGCTTTTGTCTGAGTCGCAATAGCCCTTTTTG-3′ and 5′-AATTCAAAAAGGGCTATTGCGACTCAGACAAA-3′) containing the six nucleotide spacers and five Ts then was subcloned into the HindIII/EcoRI sites of the intermediate plasmid to generate the final product. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was purified from HeLa cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). After separation on formaldehyde-agarose gels, RNA was transferred onto Biobond nylon membranes (Sigma) and cross-linked to the membranes in a Stratalinker. An 870-bp EcoRI/HindIII cDNA fragment encoding the N-terminal portion of YY2 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a DECA prime II kit (Ambion). Hybridizations with the radiolabeled probes were performed overnight in PerfectHyb Plus solution (Sigma) at 65 °C. Blots were washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS before exposure to x-ray film and subsequent visualization by autoradiography. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—pGal4-YY2-(1-102) served as a template in a PCR reaction to generate a YY2 probe with primers 5′-GAATAAGTGCGACATCATCATC-3′ and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGTTTTTTAAG-3′. The PCR product was gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]UTP using the MAXIscript™ in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). Ribonuclease protection assays were performed according to the protocol described in the RPA III™ kit (Ambion). The labeled probe was precipitated with the indicated amount of total RNAs isolated from HeLa cells followed by resuspension in 10 μl of hybridization buffer. After overnight incubation at 42 °C, the RNA sample mixture was digested for 30 min at 37 °C using the RNase A/RNase T1 mixture at 1:300 dilutions. The reaction was terminated, and the sample was precipitated and subsequently resuspended in 10 μl of gel loading buffer and resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to 3 m of blotting paper, dried, and exposed to x-ray film overnight at -80 °C. Antibodies and Western Blots—Histidine-tagged YY2-(1-167) fusion protein was expressed in bacteria using pET-YY2-(1-167), purified in a nickel column (Novagen) as described previously (2Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), and injected into New Zealand White rabbits. Polyclonal anti-YY2 antibodies were affinity-purified using GST-YY2 protein cross-linked to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad). Anti-Gal4 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunoblotting, cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The proteins were visualized using the Super-Signal West Femto kit (Pierce). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Single-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled individually using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, heated together at 90 °C, and allowed to anneal by slowly cooling to room temperature. Binding reactions were performed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 100 ng of purified YY1 or YY2 protein, and 5 fmol of radiolabeled DNA. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and separated on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels then were dried and exposed to film. Transfection and Reporter Assays—Plasmids were prepared using the Qiagen™1 plasmid midi kit, and transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Reporter and effector plasmids were cotransfected into HeLa cells grown in 6-well plates at 50-70% confluence (seeded at 5 × 105 cells/well a day earlier). 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and luciferase activities were measured using a Berthold Lumat model LB 9501 luminometer. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and all of the transfections were performed in duplicates to ensure reproducibility. Assays of Endogenous c-myc and β-actin Expression—Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, grown in 60-mm dishes, were transfected with 6 μg of pBS/U6 or pBS/U6-YY2 plasmid using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen). After 72 h, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScript™ first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's manual. 5 μg of total RNA was mixed with 1 μl of oligo(dT)12-18 (0.5 μg/μl), 2.5 μl of 10 mm dNTP mixture, and DEPC-treated water to a final volume of 10 μl and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then chilled on ice. The reaction mixture was further mixed with 4 μl of DEPC-treated water, 2 μl of 10× RT buffer, 4 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of RNaseOUT™ and incubated at 42 °C for 2 min. SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (1 μl) was added, and the samples were incubated at 42 °C for 50 min followed by 70 °C for 15 min and then the samples were chilled on ice. RNase H (1 μl) was added to each sample, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min prior to PCR amplification. 2 μl of cDNA synthesized from the RT reaction was incubated with 2× PCR Master Mix (Promega) and c-myc primers at 94 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. The forward primer (5′-TCCAGCTTGTACCTGCAGGATCTGA-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-CCTCCAGCAGAAGGTGATCCAGACT-3′) were designed to generate a 338-bp cDNA fragment derived from the c-myc mRNA. For the detection of β-actin, forward primer (5′-GCGGCACCACCATGTACCCT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-AGGGGCCGGACTCGTCATACT-3′) were used to generate a 202-bp cDNA fragment. The amplified products were fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.8% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The specificity of the RT-PCR assays was determined by including a negative control reaction in which reverse transcriptase was omitted. Identification and Cloning of Human YY2 cDNA—The human YY1 amino acid sequence (2Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) was used to screen the NCBI data base for proteins with homology to YY1. Our search identified a cDNA clone (AK091850) that potentially encodes a protein with a similarity to YY1. This clone was submitted previously to the NCBI data base by the NEDO human cDNA sequencing project group. We refer to this clone as YY2. The YY2 DNA sequence also was found in a genomic clone (U73479) derived from a chromosome X-specific cosmid library (41The Sanger Centre and The Washington University Genome Sequencing CenterGenome Res. 1998; 8: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another clone (BC012905) possessed an identity to YY2, but it may have retained exons and introns from the S2P (site 2 protease) gene. YY2 and YY1 are 56.2% identical in an overall amino acid sequence and 86.4% identical in the zinc fingers region (Figs. 1, A and B). The YY2 protein has a theoretical molecular mass of 41.4 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.98. As determined by a human genome BLAST analysis using the NCBI Map Viewer program, the YY2 gene is located on Xp22.1-22.2 of the human X chromosome. An analysis of YY2 DNA sequence reveals a poly(A) addition signal (AATAAA) 54 nucleotides downstream of the YY2 stop codon as well as an in-frame stop codon (TAA) 9 nucleotides upstream of the presumed start codon. YY2 cDNA isolated from HeLa cells by PCR migrates as a single band of 1.1 kb in an agarose gel (Fig. 1C). There are two nucleotide differences between our PCR product and the cDNA clone (AK091850), which was deposited in GenBank™. Nucleotides 26 and 431 are C and G, respectively, in our PCR product and T and A, respectively, in the AK091850 clone. Thus, the YY2 cDNA we have cloned contains a threonine at residue 9 and an arginine at residue 144 rather than an isoleucine and a lysine, respectively. Analyses of YY2 Transcripts in HeLa Cells—To demonstrate the existence of YY2 RNA, a Northern blot was performed using total RNA isolated from HeLa cells and a unique 5′ region of the YY2 cDNA as the probe. As shown in Fig. 2A, a major YY2 transcript of ∼7.3 kb was observed. Two faint minor bands of ∼11.9 and 10.9 kb and a band of ∼6.3 kb with intermediate intensity were also detected. To further confirm the existence of YY2 RNA, we performed a ribonuclease protection assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, antisense YY2 RNA probes were protected from ribonuclease digestion when hybridized with total RNA isolated from HeLa cells (lanes 3-5). This finding demonstrates the presence of YY2 mRNA in HeLa cells. Expression of YY2 Protein—To examine the expression of YY2 protein, a polyclonal anti-YY2 antibody was raised in rabbits using recombinant YY2 (residues 1-167) fused to six histidines. The anti-YY2 antibody recognized recombinant GST-YY2 (Fig. 3A, lane 7) but not GST (lane 6) or GST-YY1 (lane 8) in Western blots. It also recognized a protein of ∼58 kDa in whole cell lysates of HeLa cells (Fig. 3B, left panel). Extracts from various normal human tissues were tested for the expression of YY2. As shown in Fig. 3B, right panel, YY2 is expressed in kidney, liver, spleen, and testicle but not in the colon (compare lane 1 with lanes 2-5). DNA Binding Properties of YY2—The presence of highly conserved Krüppel-like zinc fingers in YY2 suggests that YY2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. The 86% identity between the zinc finger regions of YY2 and YY1 predicts that YY2 will interact with a consensus YY1 DNA-binding site. As shown by EMSA, this is indeed the case. In these assays, purified His-YY2 was incubated with a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probe containing a YY1 consensus site (Table I). Two protein-DNA complexes were detected by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4, lane 2). The formation of these two YY2-DNA complexes are specific, because they can be eliminated by the addition of excess oligodeoxynucleotides containing YY1-binding sites (lanes 3-5) but not by the addition of excess oligodeoxynucleotides containing an AP1-binding site (lanes 6-8).Table ISequence of oligonucleotides used in EMSAYY1 consensusAAGACGCCATTTTGAGTTACRef. 27Hyde-DeRuyscher R.P.

The binding of YY2 to these promoter sequences is specific because it could be competed by excess unlabeled specific oligodeoxynucleotides but not by oligodeoxynucleotides containing an AP-1-binding site (Fig. 5B, lanes 2-8). Under identical conditions, YY2 did not interact with the YY1 sites of promoters for interferon γ, ENOS, Spi2.1, LDLR, or H4 (Fig. 5A, lanes 3, 5-7, and 10).

Immunoblot analysis and pulse-chase metabolic labeling revealed that hephaestin is synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide modified by N-linked glycosylation to a mature 161-kDa species. Cell surface biotinylation and immunofluorescent studies of polarized, differentiated colon carcinoma cells detected hephaestin on the basolateral surface under steady-state conditions. However, a decrease in the intracellular copper concentration resulted in a marked diminution in the abundance of this protein. Metabolic studies revealed no effect of decreased intracellular copper on the rate of hephaestin synthesis but a dramatic, specific, and reproducible increase in the turnover of the mature 161-kDa protein. Surprisingly, inhibitor studies revealed that this turnover occurs exclusively in the proteasome, and consistent with this finding, in vitro studies identified polyubiquitinated hephaestin under conditions abrogating copper incorporation into this protein. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the presence of a quality control system for posttranslational protein modification occurring beyond the endoplasmic reticulum that, in the case of hephaestin, directly links the rate of enteric iron uptake to nutritional copper status.

Copper is an essential transition metal in all aerobic organisms where it functions in specific cuproenzymes to facilitate electron transfer reactions necessary for respiration, antioxidant defense, connective tissue formation, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, peptide amidation, pigment metabolism, and iron homeostasis (1Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 3. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3105-3136Google Scholar). The useful chemical reactivity of copper also accounts for the considerable toxicity of this metal, and thus specific mechanisms exist to chelate and compartmentalize this metal upon entry into the cell. For this reason, intracellular copper availability is limited under physiological conditions and the delivery of this metal to sites of cuproprotein synthesis within the cell requires delivery and transfer by specific metallochaperones (2O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 3Rosenzweig A.C. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 673-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Most cuproproteins are synthesized in the secretory pathway, and copper enters this compartment via P-type ATPases resident in the trans-Golgi network (1Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Molecular and Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 3. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3105-3136Google Scholar). Although copper incorporation is a critical posttranslational protein modification, the precise mechanisms of this process within the secretory compartment remain poorly understood. Recent studies on the mechanisms of copper incorporation into the multicopper oxidase ceruloplasmin have revealed a precise and sensitive mechanism for the synthesis of this cuproprotein where copper serves as a positive allosteric factor, increasing the affinity for subsequent copper binding (4Hellman N.E. Kono S. Miyajima H. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Hellman N.E. Kono S. Mancini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46632-46638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The allosteric effects giving rise to this cooperativity are mediated by conformational changes within apoceruloplasmin upon copper binding, thereby permitting rapid synthesis of the holoprotein under the circumstances of limited copper availability. Although such a mechanism would abrogate the need for a specific metallochaperone and could accommodate the broad variation in cell-specific expression, structure, and function of the known secretory pathway cuproenzymes, further studies are needed to assess the general validity of this concept. Hephaestin is a multicopper oxidase essential for normal iron homeostasis. Inherited loss of function of hephaestin in mice results in a microcytic, hypochromic anemia because of impaired intestinal iron transport (6Vulpe C.D. Kuo Y.M. Murphy T.L. Cowley L. Askwith C. Libina N. Gitschier J. Anderson G.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Consistent with this concept, hephaestin expression is detected in the intestine where the protein is hypothesized to play a role in iron movement across the basolateral membrane (7Frazer D.M.

Heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrates that hephaestin oxidase activity is required for iron transport and is dependent upon copper incorporation into the protein, supporting the proposed role for hephaestin as a multicopper ferroxidase (9Li L. Vulpe C.D. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of hephaestin includes a potential secretory peptide and a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane region predicted to result in a type I membrane protein, suggesting that biosynthesis occurs in the secretory pathway (10Syed B.A. Beaumont N.J.

In this study, the availability of a well studied colon carcinoma cell line expressing hephaestin and a polyclonal-specific antiserum provided the opportunity to directly examine the mechanisms of biosynthesis of this cuproprotein.

CuCl2 and bathocuproine disulfonic acid (BCS) were made fresh for each experiment and used at the indicated concentrations in appropriate media containing 1% bovine serum. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to calnexin (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and murine monoclonal antibody to cathepsin D (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used according to the manufacturer's specifications. To generate antisera to hephaestin, a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 26 amino acids of human hephaestin was synthesized and used to produce polyclonal antisera in rabbits (Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX). All of the experiments were performed with antisera purified against the hephaestin peptide coupled to AminoLink Plus coupling gel (Pierce). Immunoblotting and Metabolic Labeling—Cell lysates were prepared in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein concentration for all of the samples was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Lysates were heated at 100 °C for 10 min in the presence of SDS sample buffer, separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected with a donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) (12Hamza I. Prohaska J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling, cells were pulse-labeled for 20 min with 60 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and chased with regular medium for the indicated time points followed by the collection of lysate for immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE as described previously (4Hellman N.E.

Some cells were incubated for 3 h in media containing 10 μg/ml tunicamycin prior to pulse-chase experiments. For lysosome and proteasome inhibition studies, T84 cells were grown in the presence or absence of BCS for 2 days, pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, and chased in the presence or absence of BCS and 5 μm MG132, 10 μm lactacystin, 5 μm epoxomicin, or lysosome inhibitor mixture consisting of 20 μm EST, 100 μm leupeptin, and 100 μm pepstatin. Brefeldin A (1.6 μg/ml) and bafilomycin A1 (0.3 μm) were added 2 h after initiation of chase. Limited trypsin proteolysis was performed on hephaestin immunoprecipitated from pulse-labeled T84 cells and incubated in 25 μl of PBS containing 2.5-5 ng/μl bovine pancreatic trypsin for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteolysis was quenched by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were analyzed as described previously (5Hellman N.E. Kono S. Mancini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J. Gitlin J.D. J.

Cell Surface Biotinylation and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For biotinylation, polarized T84 monolayers were washed with PBS on ice, 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) was added for 30 min at 4 °C, the reaction was quenched with PBS containing 100 mm glycine, filters were excised, and cells were lysed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (14Gottardi C.J.

In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Hephaestin cDNA was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Ubiquitination reaction mixtures contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde (Calbiochem), 5 μm MG132, protease inhibitor mixture, 1 μg/μl ubiquitin, 35S-labeled hephaestin, rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), and either an ATP-regenerating system (0.5 mm ATPγS, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase) or an ATP-depleting system (0.25 μg of hexokinase, 10 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose) as described previously (16Stancovski I. Gonen H. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7106-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 72 °C for 15 min, and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by PhosphorImager (Typhoon 9410, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblot analysis of lysates from Madin Darby canine kidney cells transfected with a cDNA encoding human hephaestin identified two specific bands of 144 and 161 kDa, and an analysis of multiple human cell lines revealed endogenous hephaestin expression in the colorectal adenocarcinoma-derived cell line T84 (Fig. 1A). Pulse-chase analysis in T84 cells demonstrated that hephaestin is synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide with a precursor-product relationship between these two specific bands (Fig. 1B). Consistent with these data, endoglycosidase studies revealed that newly synthesized hephaestin is modified by N-linked glycosylation to a mature endoglycosidase H-resistant 161-kDa species (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3 versus 6 and 7). Hephaestin synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin was smaller than the products that resulted from Endo H or peptide N-glycosidase F digestion (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 8), suggesting that additional posttranslational modifications occur during biosynthesis. Hephaestin was not detected in the media either at steady state or during the pulse-chase studies (data not shown). To determine the cellular localization of hephaestin, T84 cells were polarized and differentiated on permeable membrane supports followed by biotinylation and streptavidin precipitation of cell-surface proteins. This analysis revealed that mature 161-kDa hephaestin is present on the plasma membrane, exclusively localized to the basolateral surface (Fig. 2). To determine whether this localization is altered by intracellular copper concentration, experiments were performed following treatment of polarized T84 cells with either CuCl2 or the copper-specific chelator BCS. The results indicate that while hephaestin localizes to the basolateral surface under all conditions, the abundance of hephaestin on the plasma membrane is reduced greatly as the intracellular copper content is decreased (Fig. 2). To examine the cellular localization of hephaestin, filter-grown T84 cells were processed for immunofluorescence. In agreement with the data obtained from the biotinylation experiments, hephaestin was found to localize to the basolateral membrane (Fig. 3, panel A). When this experiment was repeated with cells grown in 100 μm CuCl2 or 200 μm BCS, the abundance of hephaestin was affected dramatically with the amount of plasma membrane signal detected directly proportional to the intracellular copper content (Fig. 3, panels B and C). These findings were specific for hephaestin as neither the abundance nor the apical membrane localization of TLR4, a glycosylated protein localized to the apical membrane of T84 cells (17Cario E. Brown D. McKee M. Lynch-Devaney K. Gerken G. Podolsky D.K. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), was altered by changes in the intracellular copper content (Fig. 3, panels D-F). No specific staining was observed when these experiments were performed without cell permeabilization (data not shown). This membrane localization is specific to differentiated enterocytes as no plasma membrane hephaestin was detected in CHO cells transfected with the human hephaestin cDNA despite abundant intracellular expression (data not shown). These data indicate that the plasma membrane content of hephaestin is decreased with decreasing intracellular copper content. This effect of copper is on the intracellular pool of hephaestin as can be seen in Fig. 4A where immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates was carried out in polarized T84 cells incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μm CuCl2 or 200 μm BCS for 4 days. A striking difference in the steady-state level of the 161-kDa mature hephaestin species is observed in these experiments with significantly greater hephaestin in the presence of increased copper and significantly decreased hephaestin with decreased copper (Fig. 4A). Of note, the immature 144-kDa species was not affected by these changes in copper content (Fig. 4A). These effects were specific for copper and not observed with alterations in the intracellular content of zinc, magnesium, cadmium, or iron (data not shown) and were specific for hephaestin with no decrease in the abundance of calnexin (Fig. 4A, lower panel) or TLR4 (data not shown) following treatment with BCS. The time course experiments revealed that these effects were maximum by 24 h for BCS and within 48 h for added CuCl2 (Fig. 4B). These findings were not specific to T84 cells as identical copper-dependent differences in steady-state levels of hephaestin were observed in experiments with lysates from CHO and Madin Darby canine kidney cells transfected with hephaestin (data not shown). Variation in the abundance of hephaestin in cells grown in media alone is the result of the initial intracellular copper content under these conditions (data not shown). Previous studies of the homologous multicopper oxidase ceruloplasmin revealed that failure to incorporate copper during biosynthesis results in a marked increase in trypsin sensitivity reflecting conformational differences between the apoprotein and holoprotein (5Hellman N.E. Kono S. Mancini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46632-46638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase studies in T84 cells revealed that newly synthesized immature 144-kDa hephaestin is equally sensitive to trypsin regardless of intracellular copper content (Fig. 5, lanes 1-3). However, whereas the 161-kDa hephaestin present after a 4-h chase was much more resistant to proteolysis than the immature species (Fig. 5, upper panel, lane 3 versus lane 6), the 161-kDa hephaestin synthesized under copper-limiting conditions remained sensitive to proteolysis (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6, upper versus lower panel). The above data suggest that a decrease in the intracellular copper content may result in conformational changes in hephaestin that target the apohephaestin moiety for increased turnover. Consistent with this concept, pulse-chase experiments in T84 cells cultured in standard media or media supplemented with copper or BCS revealed that while equivalent amounts of hephaestin are synthesized under each of these conditions (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2) and there is no apparent difference in the turnover rate of the 144-kDa immature protein (Fig. 6, lanes 3-5), a striking difference is observed in the t1/2 of the fully glycosylated 161-kDa protein (Fig. 6, lanes 6-10). This difference in half-life was readily apparent when the rate of disappearance of the mature 161-kDa protein was quantitated under each of the three conditions (Fig. 7). This effect of BCS was entirely due to abrogation of copper incorporation into newly synthesized protein within the secretory pathway, because analysis of steady-state levels of cell surface hephaestin under these same conditions revealed identical turnover rates of the mature protein under normal and copper-limiting conditions (Fig. 8A). Consistent with this concept, the treatment of T84 cells with BCS for 4 h was without effect on the abundance of cell-surface hephaestin (Fig. 8B) despite the fact that nearly 50% of the newly synthesized protein is turned over in this same time period under these conditions (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Effect of intracellular copper on the half-life of hephaestin. Autoradiographs from Fig. 5 were quantitated following scanning using UnScanIt imaging software (Silk Scientific), and data were fitted to the curve using Sigma Plot (SPSS). The data are plotted to indicate the half-life of the 161-kDa mature hephaestin under different conditions where the amount of this protein at the 2-h time point was calculated to represent 100% of total hephaestin in each case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 8Effect of copper on stability of cell-surface hephaestin.

Lysosomal inhibition had no effect on the increased turnover of hephaestin under copper-limiting conditions, as equivalent amounts of this protein remained at the end of the chase period (Fig. 9A, lanes 3 and 4 versus 5 and 6) despite a distinct effect on the turnover of cathepsin D (18Lobel P. Fujimoto K. Ye R.D. Griffiths G. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1989; 57: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), a known lysosomal protein (Fig. 9A). In contrast, the increase in hephaestin turnover observed in the presence of BCS was completely abrogated by proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 9B). This effect was specific to proteasomal inhibition, because no change in the abundance of cathepsin D was observed under these conditions (data not shown). Moreover, the treatment of cells with either brefeldin A or bafilomycin A1, two agents known to disturb the Golgi apparatus and inhibit retrograde Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum transport (19Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), also abrogated the increase in hephaestin turnover observed in the presence of BCS (Fig. 9C). This effect of copper was direct, because the analysis of hephaestin under conditions of in vitro translation that do not permit copper incorporation during synthesis (20Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) readily revealed covalent conjugates with ubiquitin that could be immunoprecipitated specifically from the reaction mixture (Fig. 10, lanes 4 and 8).Fig. 10Ubiquitin conjugation (Ub conj) to hephaestin. Hephaestin was translated in vitro for 1 h at 30 °C, and ubiquitin conjugation reactions were performed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Lysate) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction then was divided into two aliquots and analyzed directly (lanes 1-4) or following immunoprecipitation (IP) of hephaestin (lanes 5-8). Arrows indicate the in vitro synthesized hephaestin and the high molecular mass ubiquitin conjugates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data in this study demonstrate a dramatic and specific effect of copper on the turnover rate of the multicopper oxidase hephaestin. In polarized differentiated T84 cells, hephaestin is synthesized in the secretory pathway, modified by N-linked glycosylation, and trafficked to the basolateral plasma membrane, consistent with the hypothesized role of this protein in basolateral iron efflux. The biosynthetic data indicate that the rate of hephaestin synthesis, folding, and trafficking through the Golgi is unaffected by copper availability and that it is the abundance of the mature glycosylated form of the protein that is altered by the intracellular copper content (Figs. 6 and 7). As chelation with BCS completely abrogates copper incorporation into cuproproteins in both the cytoplasm and the secretory pathway (5Hellman N.E. Kono S. Mancini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the data indicate that it is the mature apohephaestin moiety that is unstable and rapidly degraded. The marked increase in proteolytic sensitivity of the mature glycosylated apoprotein (Fig. 5) suggests that this difference in turnover is the result of conformational changes occurring upon copper incorporation late in the secretory pathway, analogous to what has been observed with the homologous multicopper oxidase ceruloplasmin (5Hellman N.E. Kono S. Mancini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46632-46638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas previous studies have revealed that the homologous multicopper oxidase Fet3p in S. cerevisiae is demetallated by BCS at the plasma membrane (22Davis-Kaplan S.R. Askwith C.C. Bengtzen A.C. Radisky D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13641-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), here the data clearly indicate that mature cell surface holoprotein is stable to BCS treatment (Fig. 8, A and B), supporting the concept that the effect of BCS on hephaestin was attributed entirely to abrogation of copper incorporation into newly synthesized protein within the secretory pathway. Importantly, although these conclusions regarding BCS and copper incorporation are entirely consistent with previous findings and the known function of BCS (4Hellman N.E. Kono S. Miyajima H. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the experiments shown here are indirect in terms of demonstrating the loss of copper and catalytic activity in hephaestin under these conditions. Although the intracellular copper content does affect the steady-state abundance of membrane-localized hephaestin (Fig. 4), this is most probably secondary to the turnover rate and not a direct effect of copper on hephaestin trafficking to or from the plasma membrane. In support of this concept, an identical effect of copper on hephaestin turnover is observed in transfected CHO cells where no expression is detected on the plasma membrane (data not shown). Furthermore, proteasomal inhibition prevents the copper-dependent turnover of hephaestin, and it is the mature glycosylated apoprotein that accumulates under such conditions (Fig. 9, A and B). These data, as well as the finding that the effect of BCS on the turnover of hephaestin is abrogated by brefeldin A and bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 9C), support the concept that apohephaestin is retrotranslocated from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum prior to turnover. In the case of proteins that are misfolded in the endoplasmic reticulum, polyubiquitination is critical for translocation and destruction (23Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although the paucity of hephaestin in BCS-treated cells did not allow for direct examination of ubiquitination of the apoprotein in vivo, translation of this protein under conditions permitting synthesis of only apohephaestin demonstrates polyubiquitination (Fig. 10), a finding consistent with the proteasomal inhibition data. These findings were specific for hephaestin, as alteration of the intracellular copper content in T84 cells did not induce the unfolded protein response or alter the turnover rate of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (data not shown). Although the analysis of ubiquitination of hephaestin in T84 cells in vivo under conditions of BCS treatment and proteasomal inhibition did not reveal the anticipated presence of higher molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates (data not shown), the failure to observe such products may reflect the physiologic balance of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and deubiquitinases present under the experimental conditions (24Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this is an important issue, and future studies will be needed to directly address this experimental finding. Most importantly, these studies of hephaestin biosynthesis reveal a system of quality control in the late secretory pathway that involves retrotranslocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Although it is well established that during protein biosynthesis quality control systems exist in the endoplasmic reticulum to ensure that only correctly folded proteins reach their final destination (25Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 26Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), the system of quality control described here for hephaestin probably is to be utilized widely because many posttranslational modifications in addition to metal incorporation occur late in the secretory pathway. In this regard, recent studies in yeast have identified a subset of membrane-associated proteins that are ubiquitinated in response to mutations in the endoplasmic reticulum degradation machinery (27Hitchcock A.L. Auld K. Gygi S.P. Silver P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12735-12740Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), some of which may be marked for turnover after exiting the endoplasmic reticulum and may therefore utilize a similar pathway to that of hephaestin for degradation. Interestingly, an analogous pathway of retrograde trafficking is utilized by Shiga and other bacterial toxins to access the cytosol following binding at the plasma membrane (28Lencer W.I. Tsai B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 639-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 29Hazes B. Read R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11051-11054Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that microorganisms may co-operate an existing quality control mechanism for the retrieval of misfolded proteins from the secretory pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum. The biotinylation and immunofluorescent data (Figs. 2 and 3) revealed that hephaestin is a type I plasma membrane protein and that intracellular copper is a critical factor, albeit indirectly, in determining this localization. The lack of plasma membrane hephaestin in transfected CHO cells regardless of intracellular copper content and previous studies that have localized transfected hephaestin to the endocytic pathway in yeast and mammalian cells (9Li L. Vulpe C.D. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) indicate that copper is necessary but not sufficient for newly synthesized mature holohephaestin to reach the plasma membrane and that additional factors must be required for basolateral membrane localization in enterocytes. In S. cerevisiae, iron transport across the cell surface requires both the homologous multicopper oxidase Fet3 and an associated iron permease Ftr1, and proper plasma membrane targeting of these proteins requires simultaneous synthesis of both (30Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Iron export in mammalian cells requires the permease ferroportin (31Donovan A. Brownlie A. Zhou Y. Shepard J. Pratt S.J. Moynihan J. Paw B.H. Drejer A. Barut B. Zapata A. Law T.C. Brugnara C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27144-27148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role for ferroportin in the basolateral membrane localization of hephaestin in enterocytes. Several studies indicate that hephaestin is expressed in multiple organs (6Vulpe C.D. Kuo Y.M. Murphy T.L. Cowley L. Askwith C. Libina N. Gitschier J. Anderson G.J. Nat.

Vulpe C.D. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel mechanism for the quality control of protein synthesis in mammalian cells that may have a broad significance for cell biology. In terms of iron homeostasis, previous work (7Frazer D.M. Vulpe C.D. McKie A.T. Wilkins S.J. Trinder D. Cleghorn G.J. Anderson G.J. Am. J.

Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 746-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) has revealed that the abundance of hephaestin is increased as systemic iron levels decrease. Although such regulation serves to increase the uptake of enteric iron, this would not be desirable when systemic iron levels are decreased secondary to copper deficiency because absorbed iron only would be sequestered further within the reticuloendothelial system (36Nittis T. Gitlin J.D. Semin. Hematol. 2002; 39: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The data in this study reveal a cell biological mechanism, whereby the systemic effects of copper deficiency promote the retrograde transport and proteasome-mediated degradation of hephaestin in enterocytes, abrogating any increase in enteric iron uptake. Consistent with this physiological model, nutritional studies demonstrate a marked increase in iron accumulation within the gastrointestinal tract of copper-deficient pigs (37Lee G.R. Nacht S. Lukens J.N. Cartwright G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1968; 47: 2058-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Future experiments will focus on dissecting the mechanisms of recognition and retrograde transport of apohephaestin in enterocytes as well as the relationship of this cellular process to quality control mechanisms for other protein modifications occurring late in the secretory pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2126923168,"We have isolated a cardiotoxin, denoted jingzhaotoxin-III (JZTX-III), from the venom of the Chinese spider Chilobrachys jingzhao. The toxin contains 36 residues stabilized by three intracellular disulfide bridges (I-IV, II-V, and III-VI), assigned by a chemical strategy of partial reduction and sequence analysis. Cloned and sequenced using 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, the full-length cDNA encoded a 63-residue precursor of JZTX-III. Different from other spider peptides, it contains an uncommon endoproteolytic site (-X-Ser-) anterior to mature protein and the intervening regions of 5 residues, which is the smallest in spider toxin cDNAs identified to date. Under whole cell recording, JZTX-III showed no effects on voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) or calcium channels in dorsal root ganglion neurons, whereas it significantly inhibited tetrodotoxin-resistant VGSCs with an IC50 value of 0.38 μm in rat cardiac myocytes. Different from scorpion β-toxins, it caused a 10-mV depolarizing shift in the channel activation threshold. The binding site for JZTX-III on VGSCs is further suggested to be site 4 with a simple competitive assay, which at 10 μm eliminated the slowing currents induced by Buthus martensi Karsch I (BMK-I, scorpion α-like toxin) completely. JZTX-III shows higher selectivity for VGSC isoforms than other spider toxins affecting VGSCs, and the toxin hopefully represents an important ligand for discriminating cardiac VGSC subtype.

Similar to the shaker potassium channel (1Sokolova O. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Grigorieff N. Structure. 2001; 9: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the three-dimensional structure of sodium channel is a bell-shaped molecule determined by helium-cooled cryo-electron microscopy and single particle image analysis (2Sato C. Ueno Y. Asai K. Takahashi K. Sato M. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2001; 409: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In terms of tetrodotoxin (TTX), they can be classified into TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) and TTX-resistant (TTX-R) types. More recently, from mammals including human, more than 10 mammalian (Nav1.1–Nav1.9 and Navx) subtypes have been identified, cloned, functionally expressed, and characterized (3Lopreato G.F. Lu Y. Southwell A. Athinson N.S. Hillis D.M. Wilcox T.P. Zakon H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Most of them can express in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, except for Nav1.4 in skeletal muscles and Nav1.5 in cardiac myocytes (4Ogata N. Ohishi Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 88: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These subtypes have been highly conserved during evolution (5Goldin A.L. Barchi R.L. Caldwell J.H. Hofmann F. Howe J.R.

Biol. 2002; 205: 575-584PubMed Google Scholar). With more than 75% sequence identity among one another, they exhibit relatively similar pharmacological properties in different expression systems. However, it is the divergent residues among the sequences of these VGSC isoforms that determine their response to distinct ligands. For instance, after tyrosine 371 is substituted by serine in rNav1.6 and rNav1.3 (wild types), which are TTX-S phenotypes, the mutants become resistant to TTX (7Cummins T.R. Aglieco F. Renganathan M.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8261-8270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the major contributors to the initiation and propagation of action potentials, VGSCs become the main targets attacked by many spider toxins. With specific pharmacological properties and higher affinity with VGSCs, spider peptides have attracted the interests of many scientists. Until now, more than 30 sodium channel toxins have been purified and well characterized from venoms of various species. NMR and homology modeling techniques indicate that, irrespective of the different composition of amino acids, most of them adopt a typical inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold distinct from the α/β scaffold emerging in scorpion toxins (9Escoubas P. Diochot S. Corzo G. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 893-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Goudeta C. Chi C.W. Tytgata J. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 1239-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Most residues in their primary structure are believed to support the peptide framework, whereas only a few charged residues situated at the loop domains of ICK motifs are critical to interact with sodium channels. Recently, scorpion toxin determinants demonstrate that some conserved aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, and Trp) also play an important role in modifying the sodium channel activities (11Sun Y.M. Bosmans F. Zhu R.H. Goudet C. Xiong Y.M. Tytgat J. Wang D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24125-24131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Spider toxins exhibit limited sequence identity in the sodium channel toxins from other origins, such as marine animals, scorpions, and snakes, revealing that there is a perspective for searching for new valuable ligands to dissect variant VGSCs. Furthermore, spider toxins have been shown to lead to new insecticides and pharmaceuticals. On the functional α subunit of VGSCs, more than six sites (sites 1–6) have been disclosed to bind certain ligands (12Cestele S. Ben Khalifa R.B. Pelhate M. Rochat H. Gordon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15153-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Spider toxins mainly interact with three of them, corresponding to blocking channel pore (site 1, hainantoxin-IV (HNTX-IV) and Huwentoxin-IV (HWTX-IV)), slowing channel inactivation (site 3, μ-agatoxins and δ-atracotoxins), and inhibiting channel activation (site 4, Magi 5 and ProTx I–II), respectively (13Omecinsky D.O.

Most of them are found to have high affinity with the subtypes of VGSCs localizing on sensory neurons, but a few affect the cardiac isoform. In this study, we report the isolation, cDNA sequence clone, and functional characterization of a novel cardiotoxin from the spider Chilobrachys jingzhao, which was identified as a new species recently (19Zhu M.S. Song D.X. Li T.H. J. Baoding Teachers Coll. 2001; 14: 1-6Google Scholar). The crude venom is lethal to mice with an intrapertoneal LD50 of 4.4 mg/kg. The spider toxin, denoted jingzhaotoxin-III (JZTX-III), is composed of 36 amino acid residues including 6 cysteines cross-linked in a pattern of I-IV, II-V, and III-VI. The toxin shows no effect on voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1.1–1.3) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or VGSCs and voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) distributed in DRG neurons. However, it can selectively inhibit activation of TTX-R VGSCs in cardiac myocytes followed by shifting activated voltage in a depolarizing direction. We further assume that JZTX-III binds to site 4 on sodium channel proteins, which is formed by amino acid residues in the extracellular linker between domain II-S3 and domain II-S4. Toxin Purification and Sequencing—The venom from female C. jingzhao spiders was collected as described earlier (16Peng K. Shu Q. Liu Z. Liang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 49: 47564-47571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Lyophilized venom (1 mg in 0.2 ml in distilled water) was applied to a Vydac C18 analytical reverse-phase (RP) HPLC column (218TP54, 4.6 × 250 mm) and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by a linear gradient of 0–40% of buffer B (acetonitrile containing 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid) over 50 min after an equilibrium period of 3 min with buffer A (distilled water containing 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid). The fraction containing JZTX-III was purified further on the same RP-HPLC column by a slower linear gradient of 30–35% buffer B over 20 min. Once purified to >99% homogeneity assessed by RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry, the peptide sample was lyophilized and stored at -20 °C until use. The molecular mass was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Voyager-DE™ STR Biospectrometry™ work station. The entire amino acid sequence was obtained from a single sequencing run on an Applied Biosystems/PerkinElmer Life Sciences Procise 491-A protein sequencer. Identification of JZTX-III cDNA—The characterization of JZTX-III cDNA was performed using 3′- and 5′-RACE methods described previously (20Diao J.B. Lin Y. Tang J.Z. Liang S.P. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). First, according to the manufacturer's instructions, the total RNA was extracted from 0.1 g of fresh venom glands of female spiders using the TRIzol reagent kit. 5 μg of RNA was taken to convert mRNA into cDNA using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase with an universal oligo(dT)-containing adapter primer (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC (dT)17-3′). The cDNA was then used as a template for PCR amplification in 3′-RACE. A degenerate primer 1 (5′-GG(A/T/C/G)CA(G/A)TT(T/C)TGGTGGAA(A/G)TG(T/C)-3′) was designed corresponding to the N-terminal residues (5GQFWWKC11) of mature JZTX-III. The cDNA of mature toxin was amplified using primer 1 and an abridged universal adapter primer containing an additional HindIII restriction site (5′-CGAAGCTTGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′). Second, based on the partial cDNA sequence of JZTX-III determined by 3′-RACE, the antisense primers were designed and synthesized for 5′-RACE as follows: the genespecific primer 2 (5′-GCAGGCATACCCTTTGCAGCA-3′) corresponding to the C-terminal residues (18CCKGYAC24). With the strategy described by the RACE kit supplier, the 5′-end cDNA of JZTX-III was amplified using its gene-specific primer 2. Amplified products in both 3′- and 5′-RACE were precipitated and cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector for sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed by Bioasia Inc. Nucleic acid sequences were analyzed using the software DNAclub (by Xiongfong Chen) (www.imtech.res.in/pub/nsa/dnaclub/dos/) and DNAman (by Nynnon Biosoft) (www.Lynnon.com). Assignment of the Disulfide Bonds of JZTX-III—To determine the disulfide connections of JZTX-III, partial reduction by Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) at low pH was employed (16Peng K. Shu Q. Liu Z. Liang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 49: 47564-47571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Li D.L. Xiao Y.C. Hu W.J. Xie J.Y. Bosmans F. Tytgat J. Liang S.P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 0.1 mg of JZTX-III, dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1 m citrate buffer (pH 3) containing 6 m guanidine-HCl, was partially reduced by adding 10 μl of 0.1 m TCEP at 40 °C for 8 min at pH 3. The intermediates were isolated by RP-HPLC, and their masses were measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Appropriate intermediates containing free thiols were dried and then alkylated by adding 100 μl of 0.5 m iodoacetamide (pH 8.3). The alkylated peptide was desalted by RP-HPLC and then submitted to an Applied Biosystems 491 protein sequencer. Preparation of Cardiac Myocytes—Single ventricular cardiomyocytes were enzymatically dissociated from adult rats by a previously described method (22Cao C.M. Xia Q. Chen Y.Y. Zhang X. Shen Y.L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2002; 443: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, Sprague-Dawley rats (about 250 g) of either sex were killed by decapitation without anesthetization, and the heart was rapidly removed and rinsed in ice-cold Tyrode's solution containing (in mm): 143.0 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.3 NaH2PO4, 0.5 MgCl2, 10.0 glucose, 5.0 HEPES, 1.8 CaCl2 at pH 7.2. Then the heart was mounted on a Langendorff apparatus for retrograde perfusion via the aorta with non-recirculating Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution bubbled at 37 °C by 95% O2 and 5% CO2. After 10 min, perfusate was switched to a Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution supplemented with 0.3% collagenase IA and 0.7% bovine serum albumin, and the hearts were perfused in a recirculated mode for 5 min. After the enzymatic solution was replaced by KB buffer containing (in mm): 70.0 l-glutanic, 25.0 KCl, 20.0 taurine, 10.0 KH2PO4, 3 MgCl2, 0.5 EGTA, 10.0 glucose, 10.0 HEPES at pH 7.4, the partially digested hearts were cut, minced, and gently triturated with a pipette in the KB buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. The single cells were obtained after undigested tissues filtered through 200-μm nylon mesh. All cells were used within 8 h of isolation. Electrophysiological Studies—Whole cell cardiac sodium currents were recorded from rod-shaped cells with clear cross-striations at room temperature (20–25 °C). Recording pipettes (2–3-μm diameter) were made from borosilicate glass capillary tubing, and their resistances were 1–2 megaohms when filled with internal solution containing (in mm): 135.0 CsF, 10.0 NaCl, 5.0 HEPES at pH 7.0. External bath composition was (in mm): 30 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 25 d-glucose, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, 20 triethanolamine-chlorine, 70 tetramethylammonium chloride at pH 7.4. Ionic currents were filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 3 kHz on EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Electronics). Linear capacitive and leakage currents were subtracted by using a P/4 protocol. Experimental data were acquired and analyzed by the program pulse+pulsefit8.0 (HEKA Electronics). The needed concentrations of toxin dissolved in external solution were applied onto the surface of experimental cells by low pressure injection with a microinjector (IM-5B, Narishige). Data Analysis—Data analysis was performed using Pulsefit (HEKA Electronics) and Sigmaplot (Sigma). All data are presented as means ± S.E., and n is the number of independent experiments. The fitted curves of concentration-dependent inhibition were obtained by using the following form of the Boltzmann equation: Inhibition% = 100/[1+ exp(C - IC50)/k], in which IC50 is the concentration of toxin at half-maximal inhibition, k is the slope factor, and C is the toxin concentration. Purification and Sequence Analysis of JZTX-III—A typical RP-HPLC chromatogram of the female spider venom was shown in Fig. 1A, in which more than 20 fractions eluted were monitored at 280 nm. The fraction with the retention time of 38 min, containing JZTX-III, was further purified by a repeated RP-HPLC (Fig. 1B). Two purifications yielded about 0.05 mg of JZTX-III/mg of crude venom with a purity over 99%. Its molecular mass was determined to be 3919.4 Da by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The complete amino acid sequence of the toxin was obtained by Edman degradation and found to contain 36 residues including 6 cysteines (see Fig. 4A). After being reduced by dithiothreitol and then alkylated with iodoacetamide, the molecular mass of JZTX-III increased 348 Da (58 Da × 6), implying that all 6 cysteines were involved in forming three disulfide bridges. Since the primary structure had a mass of 3919.52 Da, consistent with the measured mass, the C-terminal residue could not be amidated. JZTX-III is a basic peptide sharing less than 50% sequence identity with any know peptides, although its 6 cysteines were highly conserved at corresponding positions in many toxins, such as HWTX-IV, ProTx-I, and ProTx-II (16Peng K.

Except for JZTX-III and ProTxs, others had an amidated C terminus. ProTx-I and ProTx-II were isolated from the venom of the tarantula Thrixopelma pruriens. HNTX-I, HNTX-IV, and HWTX-IV were isolated from the venoms of the Chinese bird spiders Selenocosmia hainana and S. huwena, respectively. The identical residues are shaded in black. The disulfide bridge pattern of the toxins is indicated under their sequences. JZTX-III inhibited activation of TTX-R VGSCs in rat cardiac myocytes. ProTx I–II inhibited the activation of Nav1.2, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8 expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. HNTX-I blocked rNav1.2 and para/tipE expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes.

As shown in Fig. 2, four main peaks were obtained from the RP-HPLC separation of the partial reduced mixture of JZTX-III by TCEP. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis points out that the two intermediates yielded were resolved to contain one or two disulfide bridges in peak II and I, respectively, whereas peaks R and N represent completely reduced peptide and intact peptide, respectively. Peaks I–II were collected and alkylated rapidly with iodoacetamide followed by further purification using analytical RP-HPLC. Molecular mass determination and sequencing indicated that the free thiols of these two peptides had been alkylated. In Fig. 3A, Pth-CM-Cys signals were observed at the 4th and 19th cycles in the sequencing chromatograms of alkylated peak I, whereas no signals emerged at other cysteine cycles. The result indicates that the only reduced disulfide bond is Cys4–Cys19. When sequencing alkylated peak II, Pth-CM-Cys signals were observed at the 4th, 11th, 19th, and 24th cycles in the profiles of cysteine cycles (Fig. 3B), indicating that Cys18 was still linked to Cys31 by a disulfide bond. The above results indicate that two of three disulfide bridges in JZTX-III were determined to be Cys4–Cys19 and Cys18–Cys31. Accordingly, the third one is cross-linked between Cys11 and Cys24. Thus, JZTX-III has a conserved disulfide connectivity emerging among ICK motifs where 6 cysteines were linked in a pattern of I-IV, II-V, and III-VI (9Escoubas P. Diochot S. Corzo G. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 893-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequencing of JZTX-III cDNA—The full-length cDNA sequence of JZTX-III was completed by overlapping two fragments resulting from 3′- and 5′-RACE. As shown in Fig. 4B, the oligonucleotide sequence of the cDNA was a 373-bp bond in which the first ATG was assumed to serve as the translation start codon. The open reading frame, ending before the first stop codon TGA at 3′-terminal position, encoded 63 residues corresponding to the JZTX-III precursor. It comprised a signal peptide of 21 residues, a pro-peptide of 5 residues, and a mature peptide of 36 residues. The deduced mature peptide sequence was consistent with that of native JZTX-III determined by Edman degradation. Unlike huwentoxin-IV, JZTX-III had no extra Gly or Gly + Arg/Lys residues at the C terminus, which are known to allow “post-modification” α-amidation at the C-terminal residue (20Diao J.B. Lin Y. Tang J.Z. Liang S.P. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The prepro-regions common to all spider toxins are a hydrophobic peptide and can be processed at a common signal site-X-Arg-before mature peptide sequences, which is recognized by special endoprotelytic enzymes. In general, this region is composed of over 40 residues. Interestingly, further analysis indicated that JZTX-III had a very small pre-pro-region that exhibits no similarity to those of other spider toxins from diverse species including the Chinese bird spider Selenocosmia huwena Wang (also known as Ornithoctonas huwena Wang) (20Diao J.B. Lin Y. Tang J.Z. Liang S.P. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Li D.L. Xiao Y.C. Hu W.J. Xie J.Y. Bosmans F. Tytgat J. Liang S.P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is worth noting that the signal site anterior to mature JZTX-III was an uncommon one (-X-Ser-) (20Diao J.B. Lin Y. Tang J.Z. Liang S.P. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Cardoso F.C. Pacifico L.G. Carvalho D.C. Victoria J.M. Neves A.L. Chavez-Olortegui C. Gomez M.V.

J. 2003; 375: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, was found in the 3′-untranslated region at position 16 upstream of the poly(A). Effects of JZTX-III on VGSCs—Using whole cell patch clamp technique, the actions of JZTX-III were characterized on VGSCs in rat DRG neurons and ventricular myocytes, in which both TTX-S and TTX-R types are co-expressed. TTX (200 nm) was added to the external bath solution to separate TTX-R type from mixture currents. Although Maier et al. (26Maier S.K. Westenbroek R.E. Schenkman K.A. Feigl E.O. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4073-4078Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) suggested that some brain TTX-S subtypes were situated in transverse tubules of ventricular myocytes, in our experiments, the induced sodium currents were not changed in the absence or presence of TTX at 0.2 μm (data not shown, n = 4). Therefore, the effects of JZTX-III on cardiac myocytes were assayed in bath solution without TTX. After establishing whole cell configuration, the experimental cells were held at -80 mV for over 4 min to allow adequate equilibration between the micropipette solution and the cell interior, and then the current traces were evoked using a 50-ms step depolarization to -10 mV every second. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, 1 μm JZTX-III showed no evident effects on the normal activities of both TTX-S and TTX-R VGSCs in DRG neurons (n = 3). However, cardiac TTX-R currents were sensitive to the novel toxin. 1 μm JZTX-III reduced the control peak amplitude to a maximum effect by 64.7 ± 4.7% (Fig. 5C, n = 8). JZTX-III up to 10 μm completely eliminated the remaining currents within less than 1 min (Fig. 5, D and E, n = 4). The rapid inhibition was dose-dependent with an IC50 value of 0.38 ± 0.04 μm (Fig. 5F). It was observed that similar to ProTx I–II (15Corzo G. Gilles N. Satake H. Villegas E. Dai L. Nakajima T. Haupt J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), JZTX-III failed to alternate channel inactivation, although most spider toxins (e.g. δ- and μ-toxins) identified to date share a common mode of slowing channel inactivation similar to scorpion α-toxins (7Cummins T.R. Aglieco F. Renganathan M. Herzog R.I. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5952-5961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ProTx I–II have been suggested to bind to VGSC site 3 or site 4. To further determine the detailed site for the toxin of interest, a simple competitive assay was introduced between JZTX-III and site 3 toxins. Buthus martensi Karsch I (BMK-I), acting on site 3, is a typical α-like scorpion toxin isolated from the Asian scorpion, B. martensi Karsch. It can slow the inactivation of VGSCs expressing in both mammalian sensory neurons and ventricular myocytes without significantly affecting the peak amplitudes (10Goudeta C. Chi C.W. Tytgata J. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 1239-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Ji Y.H. Mansuelle P. Terakawa S. Kopeyan C. Yanaihara N. Hsu K. Rochat H. Toxicon. 1996; 34: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Exposed to 10 μm JZTX-III, the slowing currents induced by 10 μm BMK-I were eliminated completely, suggesting that the spider toxin modulated cardiac VGSCs through a mechanism distinct from site 3 toxins. Fig. 6 shows the current-voltage (I-V) curve of cardiac TTX-R VGSCs, yielding that initial activated voltage and reversal potential are -50 mV and +25 mV, respectively (n = 4). After 1 μm JZTX-III treatment for 1 min, the inhibition of currents could be observed at tested potential from -40 mV to +20 mV. JZTX-III shifted the threshold of initial activation more than +10 mV in a depolarizing direction, but no change was observed significantly in the membrane reversal potential, implying that it did not change the ion selectivity of channels. Effects of JZTX-III on VGCCs and Voltage-gated Potassium Channels (VGPCs)—There are two main categories of VGCCs distributed in rat DRG neurons: high voltage-activated channels and low voltage-activated channels, which can be discriminated by their voltage dependence and kinetics. JZTX-III (1 μm) was not found to affect VGCCs (Fig. 7, n = 3). Three different VGPC isoforms (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3) were expressed in Xenopus Laevis oocytes and checked for toxins using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (28Huys I. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1786-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). No effects were detected with JZTX-III at 1 μm (Fig. 8, n = 4).Fig. 8Effects of JZTX-III on VGPCs expressed in X. laevis oocytes. Kv1.1 (A), Kv1.2 (B), and Kv1.3 (C) current traces were evoked by depolarizations to +10 mV from a holding potential of -90 mV. After exposure to 1 μm JZTX-III, no changes of the currents were detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this work, we have isolated and characterized a 3.9-kDa toxin named JZTX-III from the Chinese spider C. jingzhao (19Zhu M.S.

Transfection of CADD into mammalian cells induces apoptosis. Here we present the CADD crystal structure, which reveals a dimer of seven-helix bundles. Each bundle contains a di-iron center adjacent to an internal cavity, forming an active site similar to that of methane mono-oxygenase hydrolase. We further show that CADD mutants lacking critical metal-coordinating residues are substantially less effective in inducing apoptosis but retain their ability to bind to death domains. We conclude that CADD is a novel redox protein toxin unique to Chlamydia species and propose that both its redox activity and death domain binding ability are required for its biological activity.

Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria and the causative agents of important sexually transmitted and disabling ocular (blinding trachoma) human diseases (1Antilla T. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 285Google Scholar). Chlamydia engages in a unique relationship with its host. Upon entering host cells, the parasite starts a biphasic developmental cycle from the infectious form, called an elementary body, to a non-infectious, vegetative growth form, called a reticulate body, and then eventually back to the replication-incompetent infectious form (2Schachter J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 138: 109-139PubMed Google Scholar). After the transition back to the infectious form, the host cell dies and releases its infectious load (3Belland R.J. Scidmore M.A. Crane D.D. Hogan D.M. Whitmire W. McClarty G. Caldwell H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13984-13989Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To accommodate its life cycle, Chlamydia may inhibit apoptosis during the early stages of infection (4Fischer S.F. Schwarz C. Vier J. Hacker G. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7121-7129Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Geng Y. Shane R.B. Berencsi K. Gonczol E. Zaki M.H. Margolis D.J. Trinchieri G. Rook A.H. J.

Recently, the Chlamydia protein CADD 1The abbreviations used are: CADD, Chlamydia protein associating with death domains; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous diffraction; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MMOH, methane monooxygenase; ICP-AAS, inductively coupled atomic absorption spectroscopy; PQQ, pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone; wt, wild type. has been shown to associate with tumor necrosis factor family proteins and to induce apoptosis when transfected into a variety of mammalian cell lines (8Stenner-Liewen F. Liewen H. Zapata J.M. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9633-9636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CADD has no close homologues but does show 18% sequence identity with coenzyme PQQ (pyrrolo-quinolinequinone) synthesis protein C (PqqC) family members, which are part of the six-step PQQ synthesis pathway in bacteria (9Meulenberg J.J. Sellink E. Loenen W.A. Riegman N.H. van Kleef M. Postma P.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 59: 337-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, homologues of other members of the pathway are not found in Chlamydia species for which genome information is available. Indeed, ectopic expression of PqqC from Klebsiella pneumoniae failed to cause apoptosis, demonstrating the specificity of CADD-induced cell death (8Stenner-Liewen F. Liewen H. Zapata J.M. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9633-9636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CADD is expressed late in the infectious cycle of Chlamydia trachomatis and is secreted into the host cytoplasm, where it co-localizes with tumor necrosis factor receptors in the proximity of the inclusion body. Sequence comparisons had suggested that CADD contains a death domain. Here we present the crystal structure of CADD, which reveals an iron-containing redox enzyme that bears no resemblance to death domains. Mutagenesis of the active site of CADD reduced but did not eliminate its apoptotic activity, suggesting that both its catalytic activity and death domain binding activities contribute to its biological activity. Mutation, Expression, and Purification of CADD—The open reading frame encoding CADD, CT610 (GI: 3329055) from C. trachomatis was subcloned into pcDNA3-hemagglutinin (Invitrogen), pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences), pet21d (Invitrogen), and PEGFP-C2. The following mutations, Y170F (CADD-mut1) and E81A/H88A/Y170F/H174A (CADD-mut2) were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), confirmed by DNA sequencing, subcloned into pet21d (Invitrogen), pGEX-4T, PEGFP-C2 and pDS-RED-C2, and transformed into Escherichia coli XLBlue. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were obtained by induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C for 8 h and then purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After thrombin cleavage, CADD was further purified on an s200 gel filtration column (Aekta-FPLC, Amersham Biosciences), concentrated to 12 mg/ml (AMICON), and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for long term storage at –80 °C. The selenomethionine-substituted protein was expressed as described (10Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C. Science. 1994; 263: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and purified as for the wild type, except that 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was added to the dialysis and gel filtration buffers. Crystallization—Purified CADD was crystallized by the vapor diffusion method at room temperature using a sparse matrix screen (Hampton). Sitting and hanging drops consisting of 3 μl of precipitant solution (10% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 12000, 20 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5) and 3 μl of protein solution (12 mg/ml protein) yielded crystals within 3–5 days. Crystals grew as very thin plates with dimensions of 200 × 200 × 20 μm in space group C2221. The crystal structure was determined by a selenium MAD experiment using a seleno-methionine substituted protein (10Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C. Science. 1994; 263: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For data collection, crystals were transferred into cryobuffer (crystallization buffer with 25% (v/v) glycerol) and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—The three-wavelength MAD data set was collected from one single crystal, using synchrotron radiation at beamline X12B of the National Synchotron Light Source. Oscillation data were recorded in frames of 1° through a continuous angular range of 120° for the peak (λ = 0.9791 Å), the high energy remote (λ = 0.925 Å), and the inflection point (λ = 0.9794 Å). The native data set was collected at beamline X9B of National Synchotron Light Source. All data were processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The CADD structure was phased and traced using the program SOLVE/RESOLVE (12Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Model building and refinement were carried out in O (13Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar). The final CADD model comprises three protein monomers (residues A7–A219, B7–B219, C7–C219), 6 Fe2+ ions with 3 closely bound putative water molecules, and 176 water molecules. Residues 1–6 and 220–231 were not visible in the electron density maps and therefore were not included in the model. Statistics for data collection, refinement, and model quality are summarized in Table I. Surface calculations were carried out with the CASTP server (15Liang J. Edelsbrunner H. Woodward C.

Open table in a new tab Cell Culture, Transfections, and Apoptosis Measurements—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Cells (106) were transfected with PEGFP-C2 plasmids containing CADDwt, CADD-mut1, and CADD-mut2, using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the vendor's protocol. Both floating and adherent cells were recovered 1 day later and pooled, and the percentage of transfected (green fluorescent) cells with nuclear apoptotic morphology was determined by staining with 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (mean ± S.D.; n = 3). Cytosolic extracts from HeLa cells were subjected to immunoblotting and probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody (Invitrogen) for the presence of GFP-CADD fusion proteins. Protein Binding Assays—A plasmid containing DR5 was in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of l-[35S]methionine using the TnT kit from Promega. GST-CADD, GST-CADD-mut1(data not shown), GST-CADD-mut2, and control GST-CD40 (cytosolic domain) fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose at 1 μg/μl and incubated with in vitro translated target proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times in 1 ml of 140 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. Mass Spectrometry and ICP-AAS—Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight, peptide mapping, and ICP-AAS-spectrometric analysis on the purified CADD protein were accomplished using standard techniques at the Facility for Mass Spectrometry at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla. Coordinates—Coordinates and structure factors for CADD have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb) under accession code 1RCW. CADD Structure—Recombinant CADD from C. trachomatis was expressed in E. coli, purified, and crystallized. The crystal structure was determined by a selenium MAD experiment (10Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C. Science. 1994; 263: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CADD is a 231-residue protein, molecular mass = 26,734 Da, which forms a homo-dimer in solution, as judged by gel filtration. The CADD monomer is cylindrical with approximate dimensions of 45 × 29 × 37 Å. CADD folds into a seven-helix mostly parallel/anti-parallel bundle, where six α-helices (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H7) partly embrace the seventh helix (H6) (see Fig. 2A). According to the Structural Classification of Proteins Data Base (18Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5594) Google Scholar), CADD belongs to the “heme-oxygenase” fold. Helices H1, H3, H4 are kinked and can therefore be represented as separate shorter α-helices denoted as A and B. This is especially true for helix H3, where a hairpin loop, residues 82–87, is inserted (Figs. 1A and 2).Fig. 1The overall structure of CADD. A, CADD depicted in ribbon representation, rainbow color-coded from N terminus (blue) to C terminus (red), with helices H1–H7, the two iron ions, and loop L3 labeled. B, the CADD dimer is shown normal and parallel to its long axis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The CADD dimer is formed through an interaction via helices H2 and H3A, residues 59–85 (Figs. 1B and 2). The interface-accessible surface area is 915 Å2/monomer, which accounts for 9.2% of the accessible surface area of the CADD dimer. The interaction is predominantly hydrophobic (55% non-polar atoms) but also includes a number of polar interactions and salt bridges. The most similar structures found using the DALI server (19Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar) are: PqqC (20Magnusson O.T. Toyama H.

Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), with an r.m.s.d. of 2.9 Å for 199 Cα atoms and 11% sequence identity; the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (R2-RNR) (22Eriksson M. Jordan A. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13359-13369Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), with an r.m.s.d. of 3.2 Å for 178 Cα atoms and 12% sequence identity; and the α-subunit of methane monooxygenase (MMOH) (23Rosenzweig A.C. Brandstetter H. Whittington D.A. Nordlund P. Lippard S.J. Frederick C.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), with an r.m.s.d. of 3.1 Å for 174 residues and 9% sequence identity. Although none of the active sites are conserved, each of these enzymes appears to be a redox enzyme, suggesting that this fold is particularly suitable for this type of enzyme. According to sequence similarity searches with the bioinformatics server Fold and Function Assignment System (24Jaroszewski L. Li W. Godzik A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), CADD shares distant sequence homology with transcription enhancement gene A transcription factors (25Pang A.S. Nathoo S. Wong S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 46-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can be used as a template to obtain homology models for these proteins. The Active Site—The seven helices of CADD provide the scaffold for a narrow internal cavity equipped with a di-metal center (Figs. 2 and 3A). The experimental electron density map clearly indicates the presence of two metal ions coordinated by 6 residues (Glu-81, His-88, Glu-142, His-174, Asp-178, His-181) (Figs. 2 and 3A). The di-metal site is located in the center of the molecule adjacent to the cavity, which most likely serves as the active site. Atomic absorption measurements using ICP-AAS revealed the presence of iron and small but significant amounts of zinc in the protein. This indicates the presence of a di-iron site, which, judged by difference maps and elevated B-factors, is not fully occupied in the CADD crystals. The small amounts of zinc might be due to oxidation and partial replacement of iron for zinc, which has been observed in several crystal structures of di-iron-containing proteins (26Stubbe J. Nocera D.G. Yee C.S. Chang M.C. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2167-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The di-metal center appears to be octahedrally coordinated and bridged by a glutamate residue (Glu-81) and a water molecule or hydroxide ion. Fe1 is coordinated by two histidines (His-174, His-88) and the glutamate (Glu-81), as well as the putative water, which it shares with Fe2. Fe2 is coordinated by histidine (His-181), two glutamates (Glu-142, Glu-81), aspartate (Asp-178), and the bridging water molecule (Fig. 3A). All 6 active site residues coordinating the metal ions are strictly conserved among CADD proteins from Chlamydia species (Fig. 2). The water molecule or hydroxide ion is coordinated by both iron atoms at a distance of 2.2 Å (Figs. 3A and 4B). It is adjacent to Asp-178, His-174, and Tyr-170 and faces the internal active site cavity. The elliptically shaped density (3σ peak in 2Fo–Fc map) for the water molecule/hydroxide ion is obscured by the electronrich iron atoms nearby and therefore not unambiguously interpretable. The electron density and resulting B-factors are also consistent with a reactive oxygen species bound to the di-iron site. The cavity next to the di-iron site shows an overall positive charge and measures 5 × 7 × 14 Å, with a volume of 340 Å3 (15Liang J. Edelsbrunner H. Woodward C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The cavity is lined with 15 conserved hydrophilic or aromatic residues (His-50, Ile-51, Phe-54, Glu-81, Ile-89, Glu-142, Asp-178, Tyr-141, Ile-145, Lys-152, Tyr-170, His-174, Pro-55, Glu-82, and Asn-87 (Fig. 2)). Below this cavity, the hydrophobic core is largely aromatic and also contains a buried lysine (Lys-152). A system of cavities spans across the core of the molecule, with two potential openings next to loop L3 and between helices H1B and H5. One opening, E1, penetrates the surface of the protein between helices H2, H3, and the unique loop L3 (Figs. 1A and 3B). It is lined by residues Ile-51, Pro-55, Ile-89, and Glu-82. An alternative access path, E2, leads from the di-iron site through a narrow opening into a second cavity lined by residues Met-21, Tyr-43, Tyr-47, Trp-92, Ile-148, Ala-149, Phe-171, Ala-149, Lys-152, and Tyr-27 and from there to the surface next to residues Trp-30 and Asp-151 (helices H1B and H5). The size of the active site cavity openings restricts the substrates to small compounds such as O2, H2O2, CH4, CH3OH, CO, or CO2. Larger molecules could only pass through by means of a conformational change.Fig. 4Comparisons of CADD and MMOH. A, superposition of CADD (purple) and the α-subunit of MMOH (Protein Data Bank accession code 1mhyD; white) in ribbon representation. The metal ions in the active site are shown as spheres colored purple (CADD) and white (MMOH). B, same as A showing a superposition of the two di-iron sites. The Fe2+ ions are shown as purple spheres with the coordinating residues in sticks (CADD in orange, 1mhyD in white). C, comparison of the active site cavities in transparent surface representation from CADD (orange) and 1mhyD (gray). The di-metal site is shown for reference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The active site of CADD is similar to that found in RNR-R2 from E. coli (Protein Data Bank accession code 1xsm). The helices forming the core that contains the active site can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. of 2.8 Å. The function of RNR-R2 is to generate a tyrosyl radical on an adjacent tyrosine with the help of its di-iron center. The organic free radical is transferred to the RNR-R1 subunit, which catalyzes the de novo production of deoxy nucleotides (22Eriksson M. Jordan A. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13359-13369Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CADD also contains a tyrosine (Tyr-170) next to the di-iron center. These similarities raise the question of whether the physiological function of CADD is the production of radicals for RNR-R1. However, no equivalents are seen for Asp-84, Asp-237, and Trp-48, which are critical residues for the radical initiation pathway proposed in RNR-R2 (Tyr-122-Asp-84-Fe1-His-118-Asp-237 to Trp-48) (26Stubbe J. Nocera D.G. Yee C.S. Chang M.C. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2167-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that CADD cannot function as a RNR-R2 but might use a tyrosyl-radical for catalysis. Cellular Activity of CADD—To test whether Tyr-170 and the di-metal site are involved in the toxicity of CADD, we generated two active site mutants by PCR mutagenesis and tested their apoptotic activity through transfection experiments in mammalian cells. The role of Tyr-170 was tested with a Y170F (CADD-mut1) mutant. To prevent the formation of a functional di-metal center, we made the quadruple mutant of the metalcoordinating residues: E81A/H88A/H174A/Y170F (CADD-mut2). When equivalents of each plasmid DNA were transfected into HeLa cells, CADD-mut1 showed a decrease in toxicity of about 5–15% when compared with the wild-type. CADD-mut2 showed more than 60% reduction in apoptotic activity (Fig. 5A). Immunoblotting shows (Fig. 5B) that both CADD mutants are expressed at similar or higher levels to wild-type. This indicates that the mutants, especially CADD-mut2, are better tolerated by the transfected mammalian cells than the wild-type. To address the question of whether the active site mutant proteins still bind to death receptors, we carried out an in vitro DR5 binding assay (Fig. 5C), comparing GST-CADD-wt, GST-CADD-mut1 (data not shown), and GST-CADD-mut2. CADD wild type and active site mutants show comparable binding to death receptor DR5, indicating that the active site mutations do not alter the DR5 binding activity of CADD. The crystal structure shows that CADD shares similarity to heme-oxygenase and PqqC enzymes. The sequence similarity and “PqqC-like” annotation for CADD proteins are reflected by the same fold, but the active sites are not conserved, and the two proteins are therefore functionally and most likely also evolutionarily unrelated (20Magnusson O.T. Toyama H. Saeki M. Rojas A. Reed J.C. Liddington R.C. Klinman J.P. Schwarzenbacher R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7913-7918Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). CADD is consequently an orphan unique to Chlamydia species, which further emphasizes its role as a highly specific toxin that evolved in this intracellular parasite. Comparison with the more distant structural homologues, RNR-R2 (22Eriksson M. Jordan A. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13359-13369Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and MMOH (23Rosenzweig A.C. Brandstetter H. Whittington D.A. Nordlund P. Lippard S.J. Frederick C.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), reveals di-iron active sites in a strikingly similar structural context. Although the three proteins belong to different fold subclasses (CADD shows the heme-oxygenase fold, whereas RNR-R2 and MMOH belong to the ferredoxin fold), the helices forming the core containing the active site can be superimposed with an r.m.s.d. <2.8 Å. The active site of CADD is structurally similar to that in RNR-R2 but does not contain the conserved residues of the radical pathway. CADD can therefore not serve as an RNR-R2, but it is tempting to speculate that CADD, like RNR-R2, may generate and use a free tyrosyl radical on Tyr-170 to facilitate redox reactions. However, mutagenesis studies with an Y170F mutant show only a 5–15% decrease in toxic activity, indicating that Tyr-170 is not essential for CADD function. The central cavity of CADD contains several tyrosines, and it is possible that another one (Tyr-47, Tyr-141) may substitute for the loss of Tyr-170. A structural comparison with the di-iron center in MMOH from Methylococcus capsulatus (Protein Data Bank accession code 1mhyD) (23Rosenzweig A.C. Brandstetter H. Whittington D.A. Nordlund P. Lippard S.J. Frederick C.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) reveals strong conservation of the metalcoordinating residues, except for a difference in the coordination of Fe1 in CADD, where Glu-114 is replaced on the other side of Fe1 with His-174 (Fig. 4, A and B). A detailed analysis of the active sites further reveals that in contrast to RNR-R2, MMOH and CADD contain an internal cavity next to the diiron center (Fig. 4C). In MMOH, the cavity functions as the site of catalysis, where substrate and product access the di-iron center through the tunnel-like cavity from the bottom of the molecule. CADD contains a similar tunnel when the entrance next to Trp-92, between H1B and H5, is used (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the opening next to the loop L3 is a potential region for a conformational change that could open the cavity to the outside for the exchange of substrate and product. Thus, CADD is most likely an enzyme similar to MMOH (23Rosenzweig A.C. Brandstetter H. Whittington D.A. Nordlund P. Lippard S.J. Frederick C.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which uses an internal active site equipped with a di-iron center to catalyze redox reactions on small molecule substrates. Further biochemical studies are needed to determine the reaction catalyzed by CADD. Transfection assays with a CADD mutant lacking critical metal-coordinating residues establish a direct connection between the di-iron site and the apoptotic activity of CADD. Alterations at the active site, which is buried within the molecule, do not abolish interaction with death receptors, which suggests that the optimal induction of apoptosis by CADD requires both the intracytoplasmic cross-linking of death receptors as well as its redox activity. We thank Jose Maria de Pereda for valuable discussions and helpful suggestions."

Concomitantly, nucleotides are released from plateletdense granules, and ADP is known to contribute to shear-induced platelet aggregation (SIPA). We found that the impaired SIPA of platelets from a Hermansky-Pudlak patient lacking dense granules was restored by exogenous l-β,γ-methylene ATP, a stable P2X1 agonist, as well as by ADP, confirming that in addition to ADP (via P2Y1 and P2Y12), ATP (via P2X1) also contributes to SIPA. Likewise, SIPA of apyrase-treated platelets was restored upon P2X1 activation with l-β,γ-methylene ATP, which promoted granule centralization within platelets and stimulated P-selectin expression, which is a marker of α-granule release. In addition, during SIPA, platelet degranulation required both extracellular Ca2+ and VWF-glycoprotein Ibα interactions without involving αIIbβ3. Neither platelet release nor SIPA was affected by protein kinase C inactivation, even though protein kinase C blockade inhibits platelet responses to collagen and thrombin in stirring conditions. In contrast, inhibiting myosin light chain (MLC) kinase with ML-7 reduced platelet release and SIPA by 30%. Accordingly, the potentiating effect of P2X1 stimulation on the aggregation of apyrase-treated platelets coincided with intensified phosphorylation of MLC and was abrogated by ML-7. SIPA-induced MLC phosphorylation occurred exclusively through released nucleotides and selective antagonism of P2X1 with MRS2159-reduced SIPA, ATP release, and potently inhibited MLC phosphorylation. We conclude that the P2X1 ion channel induces MLC-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements, thus contributing to SIPA and degranulation during VWF-triggered platelet activation.

Blood platelets are constantly subjected to hemodynamic forces imposed by the blood flow, including fluid shear stress. High shear stress is generated at sites of arterial injury where laminar blood flow is forced through a stenosis (1Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. McIntire L.V. Schafer A.I. Moake J.L.

(3Ikeda Y. Murata M. Goto S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. In addition, platelets from patients with acute myocardial infarction (4Goto S. Sakai H. Goto M. Ono M. Ikeda Y. Handa S. Ruggeri Z.M. Circulation. 1999; 99: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or cerebral ischemia (5Konstantopoulos K. Grotta J.C. Sills C. Wu K.K. Hellums J.D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) display enhanced SIPA in vitro. High shear stress is required for the interaction between von Willebrand factor (VWF) and platelet glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα) (for review, see Ref. 6Ruggeri Z.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but the effects of shear forces on GPIbα signaling are only just beginning to be defined. Downstream effectors that have been implicated in the VWF-dependent activation of αIIbβ3 include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (7Yap C.L. Anderson K.E. Hughan S.C. Dopheide S.M. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), protein kinase C (PKC) (8Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. Guo Z. Durante W. Razdan K. Hrbolich J.K. Schafer A.I. J. Biol.

Shen Y. Dopheide S.M. Gardiner E.E. Andrews R.K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A recent study of platelet adhesion to dimeric VWF A1 domain, which recognizes only GPIbα, showed that GPIbα itself can signal to activate αIIbβ3 through sequential actions of Src kinases, Ca2+ oscillations, and PI3K/PKC (9Kasirer-Friede A. Cozzi M.R. Mazzucato M. De Marco L. Ruggeri Z.M. Shattil S.J. Blood. 2004; 103: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that GPIb signals directly as a consequence of its association with structural cytoskeletal proteins (10Christodoulides N. Feng S. Resendiz J.C. Berndt M.C. Kroll M.H. Thromb. Res. 2001; 102: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), among which GPIbα-bound filamin A, filamentous actin cross-linked by α-actinin, vinculin, and talin would directly link the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbα with the β3 tail of αIIbβ3 (11Feng S. Reséndiz J.C. Lu X. Kroll M.H. Blood. 2003; 102: 2122-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Studies examining SIPA have suggested that VWF primarily stimulates platelet activation through an indirect pathway linked to ADP release (12Moritz M.W. Reimers R.C. Baker R.K. Sutera S.P. Joist J.H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1983; 101: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar, 13Moake J.L. Turner N.A. Stathopoulos N.A. Nolasco L. Hellums J.D. Blood. 1988; 71: 1366-1374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have also shown that platelet activation initiated by VWF-GPIbα interaction requires a transmembrane Ca2+ influx independent of released ADP and VWF binding to αIIbβ3 (14Chow T.W. Hellums J.D. Moake J.L. Kroll M.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 113-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ikeda Y. Handa M. Kamata T. Kawano K. Kawai Y. Watanabe K Kawakami K. Sakai K. Fukuyama M. Itagaki I.

In blood vessels, shear stress causes the release of high levels of nucleotides, including ATP and ADP, into the extracellular environment; these nucleotides mainly originate from endothelial cells (20Bodin P. Bailey D. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1203-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and platelet-dense granules (21Nakai K. Hayashi T. Nagaya S. Toyoda H. Yamamoto M. Shiku H. Ikeda Y. Nishikawa M. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 181-191PubMed Google Scholar). Although the shear-induced ATP release from endothelial cells probably involves vesicular exocytosis (22Bodin P. Burnstock G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 38: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms of such a release are largely unknown. In platelets, the time course of this ATP release appeared to parallel the association of myosin with the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that these two processes are related (21Nakai K. Hayashi T. Nagaya S. Toyoda H. Yamamoto M. Shiku H. Ikeda Y. Nishikawa M. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 181-191PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+ influx-dependent phosphorylation of myosin light chain, preceding the myosin-actin interactions, has been proposed to be an initial step during SIPA (21Nakai K. Hayashi T. Nagaya S. Toyoda H. Yamamoto M. Shiku H. Ikeda Y. Nishikawa M. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 181-191PubMed Google Scholar). ATP is the physiological agonist at P2X1, but its role in platelet activation is only starting to be unraveled. In the aggregometer, the selective P2X1 agonists α,β-meATP and l-β,γ-meATP evoke a transient Ca2+ influx accompanied by rapid and reversible platelet shape change and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, provided that measures are taken to avoid desensitization of P2X1 by ATP spontaneously released during platelet preparation (23Rolf M.G.

Toth-Zsamboki E. Bonnefoy A. Danloy S. Vreys I. Feijge M.A. De Vos R. Vermylen J. Heemskerk J.W.M. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2003; 101: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), have reported a prominent role for P2X1 in platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in shear stress conditions. Notably, P2X1 overexpressing platelets displayed potent SIPA in conditions where wild-type platelets hardly aggregated (27Oury C. Kuijpers M.J.E. Toth-Zsamboki E. Bonnefoy A. Danloy S. Vreys I. Feijge M.A. De Vos R. Vermylen J. Heemskerk J.W.M. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2003; 101: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the role of the P2X1-mediated Ca2+ influx and the associated downstream signaling pathways in VWF-dependent shear-induced granule release and aggregation of washed human platelets. Materials—ADP, l-β,γ-meATP, the P2X1 antagonist MRS2159, the P2Y1 antagonist MRS2179, and the ectonucleotidase apyrase (grade I) were purchased from Sigma. AR-C69931MX was a gift from AstraZeneca R&D, Charnwood, UK. The P2X1 antagonist MRS2159 at the concentration used in this study was verified to selectively inhibit a P2X1-mediated platelet shape change without affecting platelet shape change and aggregation induced by ADP. The calmodulin inhibitor W-7, the MLC kinase inhibitor ML-7, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, and the PKC inhibitors GF109203X, Go6976, and Go6983 were purchased from Calbiochem. Human VWF was purified from plasma cryoprecipitate by gel filtration on a Sepharose 4B-CL column. Tirofiban (Aggrastat) was obtained from Merck Sharp and Dohme. The murine-neutralizing anti-VWF monoclonal antibody AJvW-2 was from Ajinomoto Co., Inc. (Kawasaki, Japan) (28Kageyama S. Yamamoto H. Nagano M. Arisaka H. Kayahara T. Yoshimoto R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the neutralizing monoclonal anti-GPIbα antibody G19H10 was raised in our laboratory. ADP and l-β,γ-meATP were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on an Adsorbosphere HS C18, 7 μm, 250 × 4.6-mm column (Alltech) as described by Oury et al. (24Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Thys C. Tytgat J. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 1264-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Preparation of Washed Human Platelets—Washed human platelets (2.5–3.5 × 105 platelets/μl) were prepared as described previously (29Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2002; 100: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Apyrase (0.5 units/ml) was added to the blood sample and platelet resuspension buffer when indicated. Platelet preparations were free of red blood cells, as validated via microscopy and blood cell counting (CellDyn 1300, Abbott, Abbott Park, IL). Shear-induced Platelet Aggregation, ATP Secretion, and P-selectin Expression—Shear-induced aggregations of washed human platelets were performed in an annular ring-shaped viscometer generating laminar flow (Ravenfield viscometer; Heywood, Lancashire, UK) at 37 °Cin the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and 10 μg/ml human soluble VWF unless otherwise indicated. A shear rate of 9000 s-1 was used, which corresponds to a shear stress of 80 dynes/cm2. The threshold shear rate causing platelet aggregation ranged between 3000 s-1 and 5000 s-1. At defined time points, platelet samples were collected and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde; the percentage of platelet aggregation was calculated by comparing single platelet counts before and after shearing. Shear-induced P-selectin surface translocation on tirofiban-treated washed platelets was detected by flow cytometry with the phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-P-selectin CD62P antibody (BD Biosciences). For ATP secretion assays, the reactions were stopped with an ice-cold Hepes buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). After immediate centrifugation at 4 °C, ATP was measured in the supernatants by the addition of a luciferase/luciferin reagent (Chrono-Lume, Kordia) in a microplate luminometer LB96V (Berthold Technologies, Vilvoorde, Belgium). At least five independent experiments were performed on platelets from different individuals. The data are represented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis of the data was done using nonpaired Student's t tests. Immunoblotting Analyses—Platelets (0.3-ml platelet suspensions) were lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Sample aliquots were loaded on SDS-PAGE (12.5%) and subjected to Western blotting. Thr-18/Ser-19 MLC phosphorylation was detected with the anti-phospho-MLC polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturers. Electron Microscopy—Washed platelets were immediately fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, a condensed pellet of platelets was formed. After fixation in 1% OsO4 (w/v), 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and dehydration in a graded series of ethanol, the pellets were embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before examination with a Zeiss EM 10 electron microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). VWF-GPIbα Interactions and Extracellular Ca2+ in SIPA—When suspensions of washed human platelets were subjected to uniform high shear stress (80 dynes/cm2 = 9000 s-1 shear rate) in the presence of soluble human VWF in an annular ring-shaped viscometer, aggregation rapidly occurred, reaching a plateau after 3 min (Fig. 1A). In contrast, a shear rate of 1000 s-1 did not cause platelet aggregation (Fig. 1A). The inclusion of the VWF A1 domain-blocking antibody AJvW-2, neutralizing anti-GPIbα antibody G19H10, or the αIIbβ3 antagonist tirofiban (Fig. 1B) confirmed the findings by others (30Ikeda Y. Handa M. Kawano K. Kamata T. Murata M. Araki Y. Anbo H. Kawai Y. Watanabe K. Itagaki I. Sakai K. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) that SIPA requires VWF interactions with GPIbα and the activation of αIIbβ3. We also confirmed that SIPA does not occur in the absence of added extracellular Ca2+ (14Chow T.W. Hellums J.D. Moake J.L. Kroll M.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 113-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ikeda Y. Handa M. Kamata T. Kawano K. Kawai Y. Watanabe K Kawakami K. Sakai K. Fukuyama M. Itagaki I. Yoshioka A. Ruggeri Z.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Platelet aggregation was accompanied by gradually increasing shear stress-dependent ATP release (Fig. 1A). ATP release was initiated as early as 10 s after exposure to shear stress. When measured at the maximal aggregation time point, this release clearly relied on VWF-GPIbα signaling, as it was at least partly inhibited by AJvW-2 and G19H10 (Fig. 1B). Omitting the addition of extracellular Ca2+ also reduced the amount of released ATP, although only partly (Fig. 1B). The combined absence of VWF and extracellular Ca2+ almost abolished platelet degranulation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, αIIbβ3 antagonism had no effect on the degree of platelet degranulation (Fig. 1B). Therefore, both VWF-GPIbα signaling and Ca2+ contribute to platelet release under shear stress, a process that is independent of αIIbβ3 outside-in signals. MLC Kinase (but Not PKCs) Controls the SIPA-induced Platelet Degranulation—Platelet granule release that is induced by most agonists requires an increase of intracellular Ca2+ and PKC activation (reviewed in Ref. 31Flaumenhaft R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Whether or not PKC plays a role in SIPA is controversial (8Kroll M.H. Hellums J.D. Guo Z. Durante W. Razdan K. Hrbolich J.K. Schafer A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3520-3524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Oda A. Yokoyama K. Murata M. Tokuhira M. Nakamura K. Handa M. Watanabe K. Ikeda Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In our experimental conditions, the nonselective PKC inhibitor GF109203X, which blocks both conventional (α, βI, βII, γ) and novel (δ, θ, η, ϵ) PKC isoforms, failed to inhibit either platelet aggregation or release produced by shear stress (Fig. 2A), although it prevented such responses to collagen (2 μg/ml) or to the PAR-1-activating peptide TRAP1–6 (1 μm) under stirring conditions (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the PKC α/β-specific inhibitor Go6976 did not affect SIPA and associated platelet release (Fig. 2A), although shear stress-independent collagen-induced release and aggregation were fully blocked (Fig. 2B). In agreement with previous reports that PKC α/β isoforms do not play a major role downstream of PAR-1 (33Murugappan S. Tuluc F. Dorsam R.T. Shankar H. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2360-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), Go6976 had a minimal inhibitory effect on TRAP1–6-induced granule release (Fig. 2B). Finally, to determine whether other PKC isoforms could be involved in platelet release accompanying SIPA, we used Go6983, which blocks the platelet-expressed atypical PKC ζ isoform in addition to PKC α, βI, βII, γ, and δ. This inhibitor had no effect on shear-induced platelet release or aggregation, although it diminished TRAP1–6-induced ATP release by about 50% without affecting platelet aggregation (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that shear-induced platelet dense granule release and aggregation are dependent on signaling pathways distinct from those activated downstream of the collagen receptor GPVI or PAR-1. They also suggest that the known conventional, novel, and atypical PKC isoforms do not play a major role in platelet degranulation during SIPA. In addition to PKC, GPVI-mediated platelet dense granule release also depends on Ca2+-sensitive MLC kinase activation (25Toth-Zsamboki E. Oury C. De Vos R. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46661-46667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Inhibiting this kinase with ML-7 abolished both the ATP release and platelet aggregation induced by collagen (2 μg/ml) (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2A, ML-7 reduced the shear-induced ATP release and platelet aggregation by about 30%, indicating a role for MLC kinase in SIPA and associated platelet degranulation. Secreted ADP and ATP in VWF-dependent Shear-induced Platelet Release and Aggregation—Under stirring conditions in an aggregometer, MLC kinase is activated downstream of the P2X1-mediated Ca2+ influx, playing an essential role during cytoskeletal rearrangements evoked by selective agonists (α,β-meATP and l-β,γ-meATP) of this ion channel (25Toth-Zsamboki E. Oury C. De Vos R. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46661-46667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The activation of MLC kinase can also result from phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores downstream of the Gq protein-coupled P2Y1 receptor or of GPVI (34Bauer M. Retzer M.

Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the selective antagonists of P2Y1 (MRS2179, 10 μm) and P2Y12 (AR-C69931MX, 1 μm) inhibited SIPA by more than 50% (Fig. 3). In previous studies of platelet aggregation performed under stirring conditions in an aggregometer, a high concentration of the ATP/ADP scavenger apyrase always was required to demonstrate P2X1 function, as this ion channel is rapidly desensitized by ATP released during platelet preparation (23Rolf M.G. Brearley C.A. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Thys C. Tytgat J. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Thromb.

Chem. 2003; 278: 46661-46667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, the P2X1 antagonist MRS2159 (10 μm) reduced SIPA by about 40% even when apyrase was omitted (Fig. 3). Thus, the three platelet P2 receptors contribute to SIPA through secreted ADP and ATP. The effect of combined P2X1 and P2Y1 antagonism on SIPA was not significantly different from that of P2Y1 antagonism only (Fig. 3), suggesting that these receptors share common signaling pathways. Neither the antagonism of P2X1, P2Y1, nor their combination could inhibit the remaining SIPA observed in the presence of the P2Y12 antagonist (data not shown). ATP secretion assays performed in the presence of the selective P2 receptor antagonists revealed a contribution of P2Y1, P2Y12, and P2X1 to VWF-dependent platelet degranulation (measured after 3 min) (Fig. 3). With the exception of P2X1 antagonism, the effects of P2Y1 and P2Y12 antagonism on secretion did not fully correlate with their ability to inhibit platelet aggregation (Fig. 3), which is in agreement with the interpretation that these receptors participate in other processes leading to SIPA besides secretion regulation. P2X1 Enhances Degranulation and SIPA via Calmodulin-dependent MLC Kinase Activation—To further examine the contribution of individual nucleotides to SIPA, we have used platelets of a Hermansky-Pudlak patient lacking dense granules and secreting almost no ATP in response to supraoptimal doses of collagen (36Zhang Q. Zhao B. Li W. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Rusiniak M.E. Gautam R. Chintala S. O'Brien E.P. Zhang Y. Roe B.A. Elliott R.W. Eicher E.M. Liang P. Kratz C. Legius E. Spritz R.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Swank R.T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These platelets displayed severely impaired SIPA comparable with SIPA observed in the presence of P2Y1 or P2Y12 receptor antagonists (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, platelet aggregation could be largely restored by the addition of not only ADP but also of the selective P2X1 agonist l-β,γ-meATP immediately prior to shearing, which supports the central roles for both ATP and ADP secreted during SIPA. We pursued this aspect of SIPA using normal platelets but in the presence of the ectonucleotidase apyrase, which degrades secreted ATP and ADP. The addition of apyrase (0.5 units/ml) to the platelet resuspension buffer reduced the level of SIPA to 70% of the control (Fig. 4B). In this condition, the selective P2Y1 and P2X1 receptor antagonists MRS2179 and MRS2159 no longer inhibited the remaining SIPA (not shown), indicating that the reduction of aggregation by apyrase is due to the absent activation of P2Y1 and P2X1 signaling (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the P2Y12 antagonist still reduced the aggregation of apyrase-treated platelets from 26.3 ± 9.5% to 17.1 ± 3.2%, indicating the presence of sufficient remaining secreted ADP to activate this receptor. The addition of the selective apyrase-resistant P2X1 agonist l-β,γ-meATP to this set-up just prior to shearing fully restored the aggregation of apyrase-treated platelets (Fig. 4B). The resulting aggregation still depended on VWF and αIIbβ3 activation, as shown by its full inhibition by AJvW-2 and tirofiban (Fig. 4B). Therefore, this experimental approach enabled us to study the P2X1-driven signaling pathways in more detail during SIPA. We found that the enhanced SIPA was the result of CaM and MLC kinase activation, as W-7 and ML-7 inhibited the l-β,γ-meATP amplification (Fig. 4B). Notably, these inhibitors had no effect on the SIPA of apyrase-treated platelets without additional stimulation by l-β,γ-meATP (data not shown), indicating that the activation of these pathways exclusively depends on P2X1 potentiation. The fact that W-7 inhibited the l-β,γ-meATP-driven SIPA to a larger extent than ML-7 may indicate the existence of an additional CaM-dependent pathway activated downstream of P2X1. Thus, exogenous P2X1 activation selectively triggers CaM-dependent pathways contributing to SIPA. Moreover, in the presence of the P2Y12 receptor antagonist AR-C69931MX, the l-β,γ-meATP-driven SIPA was reduced to the same level (16.2 ± 3.4%) as that achieved during inhibition of apyrase-treated platelets themselves, confirming a central role for ADP also in the l-β,γ-meATP-driven SIPA. P2X1 Activation Promotes Shear-induced Platelet Granule Centralization and Release—We investigated whether P2X1-mediated MLC kinase activation would be instrumental in platelet degranulation to explain the enhanced SIPA of Hermansky-Pudlak patient platelets or of apyrase-treated platelets in the presence of l-β,γ-meATP. Flow cytometry analysis of P-selectin expression (as a marker of α-granule release) was done on the surface of apyrase-treated (0.5 units/ml) and tirofiban-treated platelets exposed to VWF and shear for 5 min in the presence or absence of l-β,γ-meATP. Fig. 5 shows a significant increase of the percentage of platelets expressing P-selectin following their pretreatment with l-β,γ-meATP. P-selectin expression was, in turn, reduced to the initial level in the presence of the MLC kinase inhibitor ML-7 (Fig. 5). Therefore, during SIPA, the P2X1-mediated MLC kinase activation can reinforce the shear-"

CtsW is largely restricted to the cytotoxic effector cell compartment, namely cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells (1Brown J. Matutes E. Singleton A. Price C. Molgaard H.

Levy B. Wex H. Bromme D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The linkage and high degree of similarity between these two molecules (58% at the amino acid (aa) level) resulted in the description of the cathepsin F-like subgroup with features more related to cruzipain, the well characterized cysteine protease of the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi (4Wex T.

Analysis of the deduced aa sequence suggests that human CtsW cDNA encodes a 376-aa protein with a putative 21-residue signal sequence, a putative 106-residue propeptide, and a catalytic triad with aa positions conforming to the well characterized features of the cathepsin family (2Linnevers C. Smeekens S.P. Bromme D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, there are signature features unique to CtsW. Of note is a 21-aa insertion between the His291 (numbering from the Met start residue) and Asn331 that contains a serine-proline-glutamine rich stretch (SSQSQPQPP). A hypothetical model of CtsW structure suggests that this insertion is part of an “extended loop” that may facilitate homologous or heterologous dimerization (6Brinkworth R.I. Tort J.F. Brindley P.J. Dalton J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). CtsW also contains a fourth disulfide bond that is not present in other cathepsins, as well as an “orphan” cysteine (Cys132) capable of contributing to dimerization (6Brinkworth R.I. Tort J.F. Brindley P.J. Dalton J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Lastly, CtsW contains an 8-aa C-terminal extension not found in other cathepsins (2Linnevers C. Smeekens S.P. Bromme D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Expression of human CtsW is largely restricted to CD8+ T cells and NK cells and up-regulated by interleukin (IL)-2 (3Wex T. Buhling F. Wex H. Gunther D. Malfertheiner P. Weber E. Bromme D. J.

Other hematopoietic cells, such as B cells and monocytes, do not contain a significant amount of CtsW mRNA (1Brown J. Matutes E. Singleton A. Price C. Molgaard H. Buttle D. Enver T.

In gastrointestinal samples taken from patients with autoimmune gastritis, CtsW is detected in up to 65% of CD45+ cells. In contrast, the number of CtsW-expressing cells in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is much lower (11 and 6%, respectively). However, the specific role of CtsW in these diseases remains largely undefined. The unique endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization of human CtsW was first suggested by studies using epitope-tagged CtsW expressed in HeLa and Cos-7 cells (8Wex T. Levy B. Smeekens S.P. Ansorge S. Desnick R.J. Bromme D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed by direct immunofluorescence using human CtsW-specific antisera as well as subcellular fractionation of HeLa cells transfected with untagged CtsW (3Wex T. Buhling F. Wex H. Gunther D. Malfertheiner P. Weber E. Bromme D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2172-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ER localization usually requires retention signals such as a KDEL motif (9Wex T. Wex H. Hartig R. Wilhelmsen S. Malfertheiner P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), KDEL-like motifs (10Pelham H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), C-terminal cysteine residues (11Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M.

Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar), or internal signal sequences (14Ouzzine M. Magdalou J. Burchell B. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31401-31409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), all of which are missing from the CtsW cDNA sequence. Whether the 21-aa insertion, the 8-aa C-terminal extension, or other mechanisms participate in the active retention of CtsW in the ER will require further elucidation. Nonetheless, given the restricted pattern of expression and the predominant ER subcellular localization, it is tempting to speculate that CtsW participates in the processing of CTL/NK cell-specific substrates and that its enzymatic activity regulates cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In fact, a recent report detected decreased cytotoxic activity in a human NK cell line treated with CtsW cDNA antisense oligonucleotides (9Wex T. Wex H. Hartig R. Wilhelmsen S. Malfertheiner P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This was the first study to support the hypothesis that CtsW is involved in cytotoxic processes. In this report, we characterized the mCtsW genomic locus. In addition, we generated a mouse deficient in CtsW using gene-targeted mutagenesis to further elucidate the role of mCtsW in cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Molecular Cloning and Sequencing of mCtsW cDNAs—A cDNA library of total mRNA from mouse splenocytes was generated using random hexamer priming. The primer pair 5′-atgacactgactgcccacctc-3′ (forward) and 5′-tcagggaggacaagaggtccg-3′ (reverse) was used to amplify by PCR double-stranded cDNAs. These primers were based on the mouse CtsW cDNA sequence, NCBI accession number NM_009985. Amplified products were subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Plasmids with appropriate insert lengths were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems model 373 automated sequencer, using vector-based external primers and cDNA-specific primers based on previously obtained sequences. Molecular Cloning and Sequencing of Murine Genomic CtsW—Fulllength genomic CtsW clones were obtained by screening a mouse (129/SvJ) bacterial artificial chromosome library (Genome Systems) with mCtsW cDNA. The clones were digested with multiple restriction enzymes and subcloned into BluescriptsKS (Stratagene). A 13-kb EcoRI fragment was found to contain the entire mCtsW gene. The exon/intron borders were sequenced and defined using vector and cDNA-derived primers. The entire locus was subsequently sequenced using intron-derived primers. Searching the GenBank™ data base, we found another bacterial artificial chromosome clone (RP23-389K5) from mouse chromosome 19 that contains a sequence with complete identity to mCtsW. RNA Preparation and S1 Nuclease Protection Assay—Total RNA from adult mouse tissues and activated lymphocytes was isolated using the previously described guanidinium thiocyanate miniprep protocol (15Pham C.T.

The mCtsW-specific probe spanning exons 6 and 7 was designed to differentiate between the full-length and alternatively spliced form of mCtsW. The probe was amplified by PCR using the primer pair 5′-atcaaacaccagcag-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctgctcattattggacaacatg-3′ (reverse). The 404-bp product was gel-purified and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). The S1 nuclease protection assay was performed as described previously using 25 μg of total RNA hybridized with 100,000 cpm of labeled probe (15Pham C.T. Armstrong R.J. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Payan D.G. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10695-10703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A β-actin-specific probe was used for RNA loading control (16Schaefer B.C. Strominger J.L. Speck S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10565-10569Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Splenocyte Activation—Activated T cells were generated by culturing mouse splenocytes with 5 μg/ml concanavalin A (ConA) and 50 units/ml recombinant human IL-2 as described previously (15Pham C.T. Armstrong R.J. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Payan D.G. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10695-10703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells were produced by culturing splenocytes in high dose IL-2 (1000 units/ml) for 5–7 days. One-way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)-induced CTL were generated by stimulating C57BL/6 splenocytes for 5 days with irradiated (2000 radians) BALB/c splenocytes at a 1:1 ratio. Splenocytes from mice expressing the DO11.10 T cell receptor (TCR) transgene (a gift from Dr. Osami Kanagawa) were stimulated as described previously (17Murphy K.M. Heimberger A.B. Loh D.Y. Science. 1990; 250: 1720-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 18Hsieh C.S. Macatonia S.E. Tripp C.S. Wolf S.F. O'Garra A. Murphy K.M. Science. 1993; 260: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (2856) Google Scholar) to generate activated CD4+ T cells for use in S1 nuclease protection assays. Splenocytes from mice expressing the DUC18 TCR transgene (a gift from Dr. Paul Allen) were stimulated as described previously (19Hanson H.L. Donermeyer D.L. Ikeda H. White J.M. Shankaran V. Old L.J.

Immunol. 2003; 15: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to generate the activated CD8+ T cells used in an S1 nuclease protection assay. NK Cell Lines—NK37.12 cells, derived from mice expressing SV40 T antigen under the human granzyme H promoter (21MacIvor D.M. Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 963-973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 mm non-essential aa, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 15 mm Hepes, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 500 units/ml recombinant human IL-2. Production of a mCtsW-specific Rabbit Polyclonal Antiserum—The putative proform of mCtsW (aa 18–371) was directionally subcloned into the XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites of the expression vector pTrcHis (Invitrogen) and transformed into Escherichia coli, BL21 codon plus (Stratagene). Purified inclusion bodies, obtained from bacteria induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, were solubilized in 8 m urea and separated from contaminating protein by SDS-PAGE (22Garboczi D.N. Hung D.T. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3429-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Emulsified gel fragments were used to immunize rabbits (BIOSOURCE International). Western Blot Analysis—Homogenized lymphoid organs and activated splenocyte cultures were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at 5 × 107 cells/ml in lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma)). Cells were left on ice for 1 h followed by three freeze/thaw cycles, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Lysate was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE protein gels under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was performed using rabbit anti-mCtsW antiserum, 4954, at a 1:5000 dilution. Rabbit anti-human β-actin (Sigma) was used as a protein loading control. Antibody-protein complexes were visualized with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). IL-2/ConA blasts were sorted using flow cytometry based on CD4 (20%) and CD8 (80%) expression for use in Western blots. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic (polyIC) Activation of NK Cells—Rag2-/- mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μl of 1 mg/ml polyIC or phosphate-buffered saline alone. After 48 h, mice were sacrificed, and spleens were processed for cell lysate as described above. Endoglycosidase H (EndoH) Treatment—Cell lysate was left untreated or treated with 2500 units of Endo Hf (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The different conditions were fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels as described above and blotted for mCtsW with the specific rabbit antiserum. Transfection of NK37.12 and Cos-7 Cell Lines—The primer pairs 5′-caccatgacactgactgccca-3′ (forward) and 5′-gggaggacaagaggtccg-3′ (reverse) and 5′-caccatgacactgactgccca-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttggacaacatggtgaaa-3′ (reverse) were used to amplify full-length mCtsW and alternatively spliced mCtsW. The products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) that encodes a C-terminal V5 and a His6 epitope. NK37.12 and Cos-7 cells were transfected with 50 μg of DNA by electroporation with a BTX EC 630 using the settings 150 V, 800 microfarads, and 75O ohms. The vector pcDNA 3.1 was used as a negative control. Transiently transfected cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before harvesting. Stably transfected cell lines were established by selection in G418 at 1 mg/ml (Fisher). Immunofluorescence—NK37.12 and Cos-7 cell lines were stained with mouse anti-V5 epitope (Invitrogen) and rabbit anti-BiP (Stressgen) or rabbit anti-granzyme A (MA2) (23Shresta S. Graubert T.A. Thomas D.A. Raptis S.Z. Ley T.J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary reagents. After staining, slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and visualized on a Nikon Eclipse E400. Pictures were generated using Magnafire software. Construction of the CtsW Targeting Vector—The 13-kb EcoRI fragment containing the complete mCtsW gene locus was used to generate the targeting construct. The 3-kb 5′-arm that contains mostly 5′ upstream sequence was amplified by PCR using the primer pair 5′-gagactagtgtcgaccttatttggttgcttcccaatc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gagactagtctaagctagaggcaggaagc-3′ (reverse) and subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). A 4-kb XbaI fragment containing exons 3–10 and 2.6 kb of 3′ flanking sequence was subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to be used as the 3′-arm of the targeting vector. To assemble the targeting construct, a 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase 1 gene promoter and flanked by LoxP sites (LoxP/PGK-Neo)) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pCR2.1 vector containing the 4-kb 3′-arm. The PGK-Neo gene served as a selectable marker for DNA integration. The 5′-arm was excised from pCR2.1 and subcloned into the SpeI site of pCR2.1 containing the LoxP/PGK-Neo cassette and the 3′-targeting arm. The junctions of the completed targeting vector were sequenced to confirm the identity and orientation of the targeting arms. Generation of CtsW-deficient Mice—The complete CtsW targeting vector was linearized with SalI, gel-purified, and electroporated into RW-4 (129/SvJ) ES cells. ES cells were generated as described previously (24Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The primer pair 5′-ggttgtagcaagagcccagaccc-3′ (forward) and 5′-cccactgtcctcgacctt-3′ (reverse) was used to amplify a 276-bp external probe fragment that hybridizes with mouse genomic DNA downstream to the 3′-targeting arm. A 500-bp XbaI fragment from the 5′-targeting arm served as an internal probe. Homologous recombination in G418-selected ES clones was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using both internal and external probes. ES clones (clones 96 and 97) with correctly targeted CtsW allele were microinjected into blastocysts from superovulated C57BL/6 females and transferred into pseudopregnant females. Chimeric males were bred to 129/SvJ and C57BL/6 females. Germline transmission of the disrupted CtsW allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Heterozygous animals were intercrossed to generate mutant mice. CtsW heterozygotes were backcrossed to C57BL/6 or maintained on pure 129/SvJ strain. In Vitro Lytic Assays—In vitro lytic assays were performed using two different procedures. Isotope release assays were performed as described previously using 51Cr- or 125Iudr-labeled TA3 and YAC-1 target cells (25Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A flow cytometry-based assay was established using green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing effector or target cells. CtsW+/- mice were crossed to a GFP transgenic mouse on the C57BL/6 background (C57BL/6-tg(ACTbEGFP)10sb/J, Jackson Laboratories) to generate GFP-expressing CtsW+/+ and CtsW-/- mice. To obtain a pure population of activated CD8+ cells, the CtsW mutation was bred into mice expressing the 2C TCR transgene (tg), which encodes a TCR alloreactive for H-2Ld (a gift from Dr. Ted Hansen) (26Sha W.C. Nelson C.A. Newberry R.D. Kranz D.M. Russell J.H. Loh D.Y. Nature. 1988; 335: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Splenocytes from 2C TCR-tg CtsW+/+ and CtsW-/- mice were stimulated in a oneway MLR with BALB/c H-2d splenocytes and used as effectors against H-2d P815 cells stably expressing GFP (a gift from Dr. Tim Ley). One-way MLR-derived CTL, induced as described above by culturing B10BR H-2k splenocytes with C57BL/6 H-2b splenocytes, were used as effectors against IL-2/ConA blast made from GFP expressing CtsW+/+ and CtsW-/- mice. Varying concentrations of effector and target cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. For measurement of target cell survival, the effector cell number was kept constant. For measurement of effector cell survival, target cell number was kept constant. After incubation, cells were stained with 2 μg/ml 7AAD (Molecular Probes) for 10 min, washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry, during which cells were collected for 60 s/sample. Effector and target cells were distinguished on the basis of GFP expression, and live and dead cells were differentiated by 7AAD uptake. The percentage of surviving cells was calculated by dividing with the number of live effector/target (7AAD low) cells in a lytic assay point with the number of live effector/target cells incubated in culture medium alone. Isolation and Analysis of mCtsW cDNA—Primers based on the published mCtsW cDNA sequence (NCBI accession number NM_009985) were used to clone the 1116-bp cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame of CtsW from a mouse splenocyte library. The deduced aa sequence of mCtsW is 371 aa (Fig. 1). In addition to the full-length form of mCtsW, we isolated a 1081-bp splice variant of mCtsW and named this product mCtsWalt (Fig. 2A). A gt/ag splice site within exon 7 resulted in the excision of 35 bp leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon after aa 231 (Fig. 2B). The mCtsWalt-deduced protein sequence also diverged from full-length mCtsW after aa Asn204. In mCtsW, Cys151, His289, and Asn326 comprise the conserved catalytic triad found in all cysteine proteases. mCtsWalt, if translated, encodes a form of mCtsW that lacks His289 and Asn326 of the catalytic triad and therefore will be inactive. It has been reported that some N-terminal sequences of cathepsins negatively regulate the enzyme activity (27Cygler M. Mort J.S. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Turk V. Turk B. Turk D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Whether mCtsWalt has a regulatory function remains to be elucidated. In both forms of mCtsW, potential N-linked glycosylation sites are found at Asn48 and Asn203. Murine and human CtsW share 68% aa identity. Based on papain, the prototypical protease of this family, a putative 19-aa signal sequence (21 aa in human CtsW) can be predicted from the mCtsW-deduced polypeptide sequence. Although there is no evidence for processing of CtsW in either species, putative cleavage sites for a proregion (106 aa in both species) and mature region are conserved in both human and murine sequences (252 and 246 aa, respectively).Fig. 2Comparison of deduced aa sequences of mCtsW and mCtsWalt. A, alignment of mCtsW and mCtsWalt aa sequences. Note that the two sequences diverge after aa 204. mCtsWalt terminates prematurely after aa 231. Only the cysteine residue of the catalytic triad is retained in mCtsWalt. B, exon 7 alternative splice site. A donor/acceptor site is found within exon 7. Splicing of the 35-nt sequence leads to deletion and a reading frameshift in mCtsWalt.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Genomic Organization of CtsW—The full-length coding region of mCtsW cDNA was used to screen a bacterial artificial chromosome library derived from 129/SvJ mice. Southern analysis and nucleotide sequencing confirmed that two of the positive clones contained the entire mCtsW locus as either a 9-kb PstI fragment or a 13-kb EcoRI fragment (data not shown). The sequence of the mCtsW gene was determined using vector and cDNA-derived primers, and subsequently, primers made from intron-derived sequences (GenBank™ accession number AY499549). The mCtsW gene from ATG to TGA stop codon spans 3.2 kb of the mouse and 3.8 kb of the human genome (8Wex T. Levy B. Smeekens S.P. Ansorge S. Desnick R.J. Bromme D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The coding region of the gene in both species consists of 10 exons and 9 introns (Fig. 3). The numbering of mCtsW exons and introns differs by one between mouse and human because a5′-untranslated exon was identified from the human genome. Using 5′-RACE, we were unable to identify a 5′-untranslated region located on a separate exon in the mouse system (data not shown). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that an untranslated 5′-exon exists in the mouse. The exon/intron borders use consensus donor/acceptor sites and are conserved between mouse and human (Fig. 3). In addition, murine and human CtsW exon lengths are conserved throughout, suggesting that the genes are true orthologues. CtsW mRNA Restricted Pattern of Expression—Detection of mCtsW and mCtsWalt mRNA was accomplished using S1 nuclease protection assays. A unique S1 probe was designed to hybridize specifically with exon 7, which contains the alternatively spliced sequence. Hybridization of the probe to fulllength mCtsW resulted in a protected fragment of 130 nucleotides (nt), whereas hybridization to the alternatively spliced form yielded a shorter protected fragment of 90 nt (Fig. 4D). An organ survey revealed that mCtsW mRNA is expressed at low levels in the thymus, lymph node, and spleen (Fig. 4A). mCtsW mRNA expression levels increased significantly upon activation with exogenous IL-2 (Fig. 4B). In addition, we detected a low level of mCtsWalt mRNA that was also up-regulated with activation (Fig. 4B). To determine the expression pattern of mCtsW mRNA in activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, pure populations of activated T cells were generated. Splenocytes from DO11.10, a class II restricted TCR-tg, and DUC18, a class I restricted TCR-tg, mice were stimulated with peptide, resulting in nearly pure populations of activated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, respectively. S1 analysis detected a significantly higher level of mCtsW transcripts in CD8+ T cells when compared with level in CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4C). mCtsW Protein Expression in Activated Lymphocytes—To determine the expression pattern of mCtsW protein, a mouse CtsW-specific rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated using recombinant protein expressed in E. coli. Western blot analysis revealed very low levels of 50–52-kDa mCtsW bands present in the thymus"

https://openalex.org/W2009391862,"Brightness--the perception of an object's luminance--arises from complex and poorly understood interactions at several levels of processing. It is well known that the brightness of an object depends on its spatial context, which can include perceptual organization, scene interpretation, three-dimensional interpretation, shadows, and other high-level percepts. Here we present a new class of illusion in which temporal relations with spatially neighbouring objects can modulate a target object's brightness. When compared with a nearby patch of constant luminance, a brief flash appears brighter with increasing onset asynchrony. Simultaneous contrast, retinal effects, masking, apparent motion and attentional effects cannot account for this illusory enhancement of brightness. This temporal context effect indicates that two parallel streams--one adapting and one non-adapting--encode brightness in the visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2171089551,"STAT4 signaling, activated by either interleukin 12 (IL12) or interferon α (IFNα), promotes TH1 responses in CD4+ T cells. Vascular endothelial cells (EC) may also become polarized in response to various cytokines, favoring recruitment and activation of TH1 or TH2 effector cells. Here we have investigated the role of the STAT4 pathway in EC. Cultured human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) express low levels of STAT4, which may be tyrosine-phosphorylated by treatment with IFNα but not IL12. This is because HUVEC lack both subunits of the IL12 receptor (IL12Rβ1 and IL12Rβ2), even following treatment with various cytokines. IL12 phosphorylation of STAT4 can be observed in HUVEC that have been transduced to express the IL12R. To identify STAT4-induced genes we pursued three approaches: analysis by DNA microarray and quantitative RT-PCR (Q-PCR) of the IL12 responses in IL12R-transduced EC; analysis by Q-PCR of IFNα responses in STAT4-overexpressing EC; and analysis of IFNα responses in U3A neuroblastoma cell lines that express either STAT1 or STAT4, but not both. In all three instances we observe STAT4-mediated induction of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) mRNA, and we confirm the production of each protein in both IL12R-transduced EC and STAT4-transduced U3A cells. These observations reveal that there is a STAT4 response of EC, activated by IFNα but not IL12, and that it may modulate the pro-inflammatory behavior of EC.

In the resting state EC do not normally interact with circulating leukocytes. However, in response to inflammatory stimuli EC express cell surface adhesion molecules including E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) that allow for tethering and firm attachment of leukocytes, and ultimately their transmigration into the underlying tissues. The process of leukocyte recruitment by EC has been extensively reviewed (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar, 2Luscinskas F.W. Ma S.

In general, the inflammatory response promoted by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), predominantly involves recruitment of neutrophils. However, the pro-inflammatory functions of human EC can be modulated by cytokines such as IFNγ, a TH1 cytokine, and IL4 and IL13, both TH2 cytokines, to favor recruitment of other cell types. Treatment of cultured EC with IFNγ enhances expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 (4Doukas J. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1727-1733PubMed Google Scholar), and the production of chemokines MIG, IP-10, and I-TAC (5Raju R. Malloy A. Shah T. Smith R. Oaks M. Hosenpud J.D. Transplantation. 2003; 75: 1072-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6Monaco C. Andreakos E. Young S. Feldmann M. Paleolog E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 71: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar), all of which may favor the recruitment of macrophages and possibly TH1 CD4+ lymphocytes. In contrast, IL4 treatment of EC attenuates E-selectin (7Bennett B.L. Cruz R. Lacson R.G. Manning A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10212-10219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) but promotes VCAM-1 expression (8Thornhill M.H. Wellicome S.M. Mahiouz D.L. Lanchbury J.S. Kyan-Aung U. Haskard D.O. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar) and leads to the production of chemokines such as eotaxin-3, which favor eosinophil recruitment and a TH2-like pattern of inflammation (9Shinkai A. Yoshisue H. Koike M. Shoji E. Nakagawa S. Saito A. Takeda T. Imabeppu S. Kato Y. Hanai N. Anazawa H. Kuga T. Nishi T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1602-1610PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cuvelier S.L. Patel K.D. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The effects of IFNγ are mediated by the transcription factor STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) (11Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and those of IL4 (and the related cytokine IL13) by STAT6 (12Wurster A.L. Tanaka T. Grusby M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Another member of the STAT family, STAT4, which is activated by IL12 and IFNα, also contributes to TH1 responses (12Wurster A.L. Tanaka T. Grusby M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). STAT4 was first identified based on homology to other STAT proteins, and has been most extensively investigated as the mediator of IL12 responses in both human and murine T lymphocytes (12Wurster A.L. Tanaka T. Grusby M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 13Yamamoto K. Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G.

A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). IL12 binding to the IL12 receptor (IL12R) leads to dimerization of the two receptor subunits (IL12Rβ1 and IL12Rβ2) and activation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases Jak2 and Tyk2. These kinases then specifically phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the IL12R intracytoplasmic regions that allow for STAT4 binding and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT4 on tyrosine residue 693. Phosphorylated STAT4 dissociates from the receptor, dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to STAT target sequences in IL12 responsive genes (15Jacobson N.G. Szabo S.J. Weber-Nordt R.M.

Miyasaka N. Miura O. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Zhang S. Schmidt N. Yu Q. Ramchandani S. Xu X. Naeger L.K. Sun Y.L. Kaplan M.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4237-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). STAT4 can also be activated by type 1 interferons. At least in humans, STAT4 is recruited to the IFNα receptor (IFNAR) indirectly via receptor-associated STAT2, leading to STAT4 tyrosine phosphorylation and ultimately the activation of STAT4-dependent genes as above (22Farrar J.D.

The STAT4 signaling pathway plays a role in the polarization of CD4+ cell responses to an IFNγ-secreting TH1 pheno-type, and STAT4-deficient mice have impaired TH1 responses (24Kaplan M.H. Sun Y.L.

Azzarone B. Delfraissy J.F. Taoufik Y. Blood. 2003; 102: 4084-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), NK cells (16Cho S.S. Bacon C.M. Sudarshan C. Rees R.C. Finbloom D. Pine R. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4781-4789PubMed Google Scholar), dendritic cells (DC), monocytes, and macrophages (28Frucht D.M. Aringer M. Galon J. Danning C. Brown M. Fan S. Centola M. Wu C.Y. Yamada N.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 4446-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). IL12-induced STAT4 activation in both B and NK cells stimulates IFNγ secretion. Immature DC and resting monocytes or macrophages express little STAT4. Upon DC maturation or monocyte/macrophage activation, for example by LPS, STAT4 expression is up-regulated and mediates IL12- or IFNα-induced IFNγ secretion. Human monocytes activate STAT4 in response only to IFNα, and not IL12 (28Frucht D.M. Aringer M. Galon J. Danning C. Brown M. Fan S. Centola M. Wu C.Y. Yamada N. El Gabalawy H. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4659-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Two reports have suggested that STAT4 may be expressed in non-lymphoid or non-myeloid cells. Specifically, STAT4 tyrosine phosphorylation was induced by cell surface binding of sublytic terminal complement complex in human aortic EC (30Niculescu F. Soane L. Badea T. Shin M. Rus H. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 42: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and by treatment of human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) with urokinase (31Dumler I. Kopmann A. Wagner K. Mayboroda O.A. Jerke U. Dietz R. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24059-24065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There are also some reports that both EC and VSMC may respond to IL12. In one study HUVEC were pretreated with IL12 prior to co-culture with allogeneic CD4+ T lymphocytes, and in the presence of the polyclonal mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA), IL12-treated EC enhanced IFNγ production by the T cells, compared with untreated EC (32Briscoe D.M. Henault L.E. Geehan C. Alexander S.I. Lichtman A.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3247-3256PubMed Google Scholar). A second study demonstrated that primary VSMC cultures treated with the combination of IL12 and IL18 could secrete IFNγ (33Gerdes N. Sukhova G.K. Libby P. Reynolds R.S. Young J.L. Schonbeck U. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether either IL12 or IFNα can activate a functional STAT4 signaling pathway in either human EC or VSMC, or whether STAT4 activation leads to the induction of gene expression in either cell type. In this report we demonstrate that human EC do express STAT4, but not the IL12 receptor. IFNα induces STAT4 tyro-sine phosphorylation, as does IL12 in HUVEC transduced to express both subunits of the IL12R. STAT4 signaling results in induction of the genes encoding the chemokine MCP1 and the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3, identifying a STAT4-dependent pathway that may influence the pro-inflammatory functions of EC.

Cell Culture—All human cell types were isolated following protocols approved by the Yale Human Investigation Committee. Human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were isolated from discarded umbilical cords as previously described (34Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Prog. Hemost. Thromb. 1976; 3: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). ECs from 2 or 3 cords were pooled and serially cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2-humidified air on tissue culture plastic coated with 0.1% gelatin in Medium 199 (M199) containing 20% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS, BD Biosciences) and 100 μg/ml porcine intestinal heparin (Sigma). Confluent cultures were serially passaged by trypsinization and used for experiments at the second or third subculture. The culture medium was changed at least 24 h prior to any cytokine treatment. Cytokines were added directly to the cultures without further change of media. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) were isolated from discarded human skin, purified using anti-CD31 mini MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and cultured in EGM2-MV growth medium (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) as previously described (35Kluger M.S.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained by leukapheresis of adult volunteer donors, and further purified by centrifugation over lymphocyte separation medium (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated PBMC were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine. To produce PHA-activated PBMC, 5 × 106 PBMC were cultured in 1 μg/ml PHA for 3 days, supplemented with 10 units/ml IL2 (R&D systems) on day 2. The Phoenix-Ampho packaging cell line (a kind gift of Dr G. Nolan, Stanford University, Stanford, CA), and U3A cells (a kind gift of Dr. G. Stark, Cleveland Clinic Foundation) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. DNA Constructs and Retroviral Transduction—cDNAs encoding human IL12Rβ1 and IL12Rβ2 subcloned into the vectors pBluescript II SK+ and SK-, respectively, were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA).

Primers to amplify the coding region of STAT4 from a plasmid kindly provided by Dr. D. Farrar (Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) were 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGATAAGAAAGCGGCCATGTCTCAGTGGAATCAAG-3′ and 5′-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCATTCTTATTCATTCAGCAGAATATGG-3′. This too was subcloned into LZRSpBMN-Z. STAT1 and, as a control, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the same vector were kindly provided by Dr. K. Mahboubi and Dr. A. Bothwell (Yale University, New Haven, CT). LZRSpBMN-Z constructs were transfected into Phoenix-Ampho cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Puromycin-resistant cells were selected and used to condition either M199 (containing 10% FCS and 2 mm l-glutamine but without ECGS, heparin or antibiotics) for HUVEC transduction or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS and 2 mm l-glutamine for U3A cell transduction. Collection of virus-conditioned medium and transduction of primary HUVEC cultures were performed as previously described (36Mahboubi K. Kirkiles-Smith N.C. Karras J. Pober J.S. J. Biol.

For transduction of U3A cells, the cells were grown in virus-conditioned medium containing 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) for 24 h and then passaged once prior to use. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and ELISA—Lysis of confluent U3A cell and HUVEC cultures grown in 6-well or 10-cm diameter tissue culture dishes (Falcon, BD Biosciences), sample preparation, and immunoblotting were performed exactly as described previously (36Mahboubi K.

For immunoprecipitation, confluent cultures in 10-cm plates were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm pefabloc, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride) and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Lysates were precleared by incubation with 4 μg of goat IgG (R&D Systems) and 50 μl of washed protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following brief centrifugation to remove the beads, the lysates were incubated with 4 μg of STAT4 antibody and 50 μl of washed protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. The Sepharose beads were recovered by brief centrifugation, washed five times in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer as previously described (36Mahboubi K.

Once the reaction was complete, the template RNA was hydrolyzed by incubation with 50 mm EDTA and 100 mm sodium hydroxide at 65 °C for 20 min. Following extraction with phenol/chloroform the cDNA was concentrated to a volume of 6 μl using an Amicon YM30 centrifugal filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and incubated with 1 μl of 5 mg/ml Cy3 or Cy5 monoreactive dyes dissolved in Me2SO (Amersham Biosciences) and 0.7 μl of 1 m sodium bicarbonate for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Unconjugated dye was removed by addition of 500 μl of water and concentration in a YM30 column, repeated three times. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined and resuspended in a final volume of 15 μl of water. Hybridization was performed in 1× Denhardt's solution (Amersham Biosciences), 4× SSPE (Ambion, Austin, TX), 0.2%SDS, containing 120 μg/ml poly(dA), 240 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 600 μg/ml human CotI DNA (all from Invitrogen) in a final volume of 26.4 μl. The probe mixture was heated to 94 °C for 2 min and then cooled to 55 °C before application to a DNA microarray comprising 16,000 70-mer oligonucleotide spots prepared by the Yale Keck Foundation Biopolymer Resource Laboratory. The probe was covered with a coverslip and incubated overnight at 55 °C in a water bath. After removing the coverslip the slide was washed in 2× SSC (Ambion)/0.1% SDS, 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS (twice), and 0.2× SSC, each for 12 min at room temperature. The microarray was scanned by the Yale/Keck facility and analyzed using GenePix software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Flow Cytometry—For cell surface immunostaining, HUVEC, or HDMEC were washed twice with Hanks-buffered saline solution (HBSS) and incubated with trypsin/EDTA for 1 min. Detached cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide (PBS/BSA), and incubated with either IL12Rβ1 or IL12Rβ2 antibodies or isotype controls at 2 μg/ml in PBS/BSA for 2 h at 4 °C. After two further washes cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml PE- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies in PBS/BSA for 1 h at 4 °C, washed a further two times and analyzed on a FACSort using Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). For intracellular immunostaining of STAT4, cells were detached as above and washed twice with ice-cold PBS before fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After a further two washes in PBS, cells were permeabilized for 15 min in PERM buffer (PBS containing 0.1% saponin, 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% sodium azide), washed once in PERM buffer and incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-STAT4 or goat IgG (R&D systems). Further washes and incubation with secondary antibody, all in PERM buffer, and flow cytometry were carried out as above. IFNα, but Not IL12 or IFNγ, Induces STAT4 Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Cultured HUVEC—IL12 or IFNα-mediated polarization of T cell immune responses to a TH1 phenotype depends on activation of the transcription factor STAT4. To determine whether this pathway is active in EC, we first investigated whether HUVEC express STAT4, and whether treatment with either IL12 or IFNα could induce STAT4 tyrosine phosphorylation. Because of its low abundance, we were unable to detect STAT4 by direct immunoblotting. To increase sensitivity we used immunoprecipitation with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody, followed by immunoblotting, either with the STAT4 antibody or a phosphotyrosine-specific (Tyr693) STAT4 antibody. Fig. 1A shows that STAT4 could be immunoprecipitated from both HUVEC and PBMC. Treatment of both cell types with IFNα resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT4, which was transient in HUVEC when compared with PBMC. In contrast, IL12 induced STAT4 tyrosine-phosphorylation only in PBMC and not in HUVEC (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of STAT4 in HUVEC is specific to type 1 IFN, and not induced by treatment with IFNγ (Fig. 1B), although both interferon types induce STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Parallel experiments using HDMEC and VSMC demonstrated STAT4 expression and tyrosine phosphorylation by IFNα in HDMEC but not in aortic or coronary artery VSMC (data not shown). These results demonstrate that cultured EC express STAT4, and that there appears to be a STAT4 signaling pathway in EC that may be activated by IFNα. Basal expression of STAT4 in both resting lymphocytes and monocytes is up-regulated upon activation of T cells, for example by PHA (16Cho S.S. Bacon C.M. Sudarshan C. Rees R.C. Finbloom D. Pine R. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4781-4789PubMed Google Scholar), and of monocytes by LPS or IFNγ (28Frucht D.M. Aringer M. Galon J. Danning C. Brown M. Fan S. Centola M. Wu C.Y. Yamada N. El Gabalawy H. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4659-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether STAT4 expression in HUVEC could be induced by similar treatments. Incubation of HUVEC with IFNα, LPS, IL6, oncostatin M, or VEGF for 24 or 72 h neither enhanced nor suppressed STAT4 expression (data not shown). However, 72 h treatment with IFNγ both reduced total STAT4 levels and attenuated STAT4 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IFNα (Fig. 1C). IFNα-induced STAT1 phosphorylation was unaffected by IFNγ pretreatment. HUVEC Transduced to Express the IL12 Receptor Phosphorylate STAT4 and STAT3 in Response to IL12—HUVEC may be unable to respond to IL12 because they do not express one or both of the IL12R subunits, or because they lack downstream components of IL12R-mediated signaling. To investigate the first possibility, we performed RT-PCR on RNA extracted from HUVEC and PBMC. Both IL12Rβ1 and IL12Rβ2 mRNA could be detected in PBMC, but neither in HUVEC (Fig. 2). This analysis was repeated on 3 HUVEC cultures, each derived from 2 donors. In no case could either IL12R subunit be identified. Similarly, we could not identify mRNA for either IL12R subunit in isolates of cultured HDMEC (not shown). We also failed to find IL12R subunits by RT-PCR and flow cytometry on both HUVEC and HDMEC that were either untreated or treated with IFNγ, TNF, both in combination, LPS or IFNα (data not shown). We next determined whether IL12 could induce STAT4 tyrosine phosphorylation in HUVEC transduced to express the IL12 receptor. Primary cultures of HUVEC were transduced to express both IL12Rβ1 and IL12Rβ2 or, as a control, EGFP. Cell surface expression of each subunit was analyzed by flow cytometry after 4 rounds of retroviral transduction. More than 95% of the HUVEC expressed either IL12R subunit, and 84% expressed both (Fig. 3A). Comparable frequencies of EGFP expression were o"

Caspases trigger apoptotic chromatin degradation by activating caspase-activated DNase and by inactivating a number of enzymes that sense or repair DNA damage. We have identified the mismatch repair protein MLH1 as a novel caspase-3 substrate by screening small pools of a human prostate adenocarcinoma cDNA library for cDNAs encoding caspase substrates. In this report, we demonstrate that human MLH1 is specifically cleaved by caspase-3 at Asp418in vitro. Furthermore, MLH1 is rapidly proteolyzed by caspase-3 in cancer cells induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, which damages DNA. Importantly, proteolysis of MLH1 by caspase-3 triggers its partial redistribution from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and generates a proapoptotic carboxyl-terminal product. In addition, we demonstrate that a caspase-3 cleavage-resistant D418E MLH1 mutant inhibits etoposide-induced apoptosis but has little effect on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that the proteolysis of MLH1 by caspase-3 plays a functionally important and previously unrecognized role in the execution of DNA damage-induced apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W1992545443,"We previously reported that c-Jun binds directly to the N-terminal 163 amino acids of Homo sapiens TATA-binding protein-associated factor-1 (hsTAF1), causing a derepression of transcription factor IID (TFIID)-driven transcription (Lively, T. N., Ferguson, H. A., Galasinski, S. K., Seto, A. G., and Goodrich, J. A. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 25582–25588). This region of hsTAF1 binds TATA-binding protein to repress TFIID DNA binding and transcription. Here we show that the basic leucine zipper domain of c-Jun, which allows for DNA binding and homodimerization, is necessary and sufficient for interaction with hsTAF1. Interestingly, the isolated basic leucine zipper domain of c-Jun was able to derepress TFIID-directed basal transcription in vitro. Moreover, when the N-terminal region of hsTAF1 was added to in vitro transcription reactions and overexpressed in cells, it blocked c-Jun activation. c-Fos, another basic leucine zipper protein, did not interact with hsTAF1, but c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers did bind the N terminus of hsTAF1. Our studies show that, in addition to dimerization and DNA binding, the well characterized basic leucine zipper domain of c-Jun functions in transcriptional activation by binding to the N terminus of hsTAF1 to derepress transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1999472603,"Much work has been focused on the pathways that restore the integrity of the genome after different kinds of lesions, especially double-strand breaks. A classical method to investigate double-strand break repair is the incubation of a DNA substrate with cell-free extracts. In these end-joining assays, the DNA is efficiently ligated by the proteins present in the extract, generating circular molecules and/or multimers. In contrast, using a similar in vitro system, we detected DNA cleavage rather than end ligation. When comparing our results with previous works, a paradox emerges: lower amounts of DNA become multimerized instead of degraded and higher amounts of DNA are degraded rather than multimerized. Here, we have demonstrated that when the DNA/protein ratio is low enough, the DNA-binding proteins of the nuclear extract protect the DNA substrate, avoiding DNA degradation and vice versa. Therefore, the variation of the DNA/protein ratio is enough to switch the outcome of the experiment from a DNA cleavage assay to a typical end-joining assay.

The function of the genome in the cell nucleus depends on a balance between DNA damage and repair. Much work has been focused on the pathways that restore the integrity of the DNA after different kinds of lesions, especially double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; NHEJ, non-homologous end-joining; H1, histone H1; ProTα, prothymosin α; TAE, 0.04 m Tris-acetate, 0.001 EDTA, pH 8.0.1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; NHEJ, non-homologous end-joining; H1, histone H1; ProTα, prothymosin α; TAE, 0.04 m Tris-acetate, 0.001 EDTA, pH 8.0. (1Pastink A. Eecker J.C. Lohman P.H. Mutat. Res. 2001; 480-481: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Because DSBs are one of the most common injuries affecting DNA (2Chu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 275: 26196-26205Google Scholar), the repair of these breaks is essential for the equilibrium of the genome (3Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. van Gent D.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Therefore, the knowledge of the processes involved both in DNA cleavage, including DSB generation, and DNA repair are crucial to understanding the stability of the genome. There are two main mechanisms that participate in DSB removal in higher eukaryotes: the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and the homologous recombination (4Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 5Richardson C. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9068-9075Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). NHEJ is a non-conservative pathway that achieves DSB repair without the need of extensive homology between the DNA ends to be joined. It frequently involves DNA end-binding by Ku70 and Ku80 proteins, which activate the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPKcs) by stabilizing its interaction with DNA ends (6Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This facilitates rejoining by a DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 heterodimer (6Karran P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition, NHEJ is known to be involved in V(D)J recombination and immunoglobulin class switching in mammals (7Singleton B.K. Jeggo P.A. Smith P.J. Jones C.J. DNA Recombination and Repair. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 16-37Google Scholar). A classical method to investigate DNA repair is the incubation of a DNA substrate containing a specific DSB with cell-free extracts (8North P. Ganesh A. Thacker J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6205-6210Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Nicolas A.L. Young C.S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Using this system, Baumann and West (10Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) developed the first in vitro end-joining assay that demonstrated a requirement for factors such as Ku70, Ku80, DNAPKcs, DNA ligase IV, and XRCC4, some of them known to be implicated in NHEJ by previous genetic studies. Later on, similar assays were carried out to investigate the involvement of other factors such as BRCA-1 (11Zhong Q. Boyer T.G. Chen P-L. Lee W-H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3966-3970PubMed Google Scholar), DNA polymerase α (12Pospiech H. Rytkönen A.K. Syväoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3277-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or human polynucleotide kinase (13Chappell C. Hanahaki L.A. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. West S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2827-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) in NHEJ. In these end-joining assays, the DNA was always efficiently ligated by the proteins present in the extract, generating circular molecules and/or multimers of the original substrate (10Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Zhong Q. Boyer T.G. Chen P-L. Lee W-H.

Surprisingly, little or no degradation of the DNA substrate was observed in the outcome of these assays, although endogenous nuclease activities should be present in those extracts. We have developed an in vitro assay that also implies incubation of a DNA fragment with nuclear extracts. This assay was primarily designed for the detection and location of DNA breaks in the human minisatellite MsH42 region (18Boán F. González A.I. Rodríguez J.M. Gómez-Márquez J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which has been demonstrated to enhance in vitro intramolecular homologous recombination (19Boán F. Rodríguez J.M. Gómez-Márquez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Boán F. Rodíguez J.M. Mouriño S. Blanco M.G. Viñas A. Sánchez L. Gómez-Márquez J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast to other assays, our in vitro system mainly promotes DNA substrate degradation instead of its multimerization. Why are DNA substrates preferentially degraded in our assay, whereas they are endligated in other in vitro end-joining assays? In the present work, we have investigated the differences between these end-joining assays and our assay. Our results revealed the effect of the DNA-binding proteins present in the cell-free extract on the outcome of in vitro DNA cleavage/end-joining experiments. DNA Substrates and Nuclear Extracts—In our assays, the DNA used as substrate was an 880-bp DNA fragment (Ms fragment) that comprises the human minisatellite MsH42 region (18Boán F. González A.I. Rodríguez J.M. Gómez-Márquez J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This fragment was obtained by EcoRI digestion of a pGemT-Easy plasmid that harbors this region and was purified by electroelution, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. For some assays, an aliquot of the Ms fragment was end-labeled by the exchange reaction of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) using [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/μl, 3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) following the protocol of the manufacturer. The end-labeled DNA was purified with the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen), yielding a specific activity of ∼2.8 × 107 cpm/μg. On the other hand, nuclear extracts were prepared from 2-month-old (∼300 g) Sprague-Dawley rat testes as described elsewhere (21Abmayr S.B. Workman J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1987: 12-3-12-6Google Scholar). The aliquots of nuclear extracts were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and quantified by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). DNA Cleavage Assay—The standard assay was performed by incubating 1.5 μg of the Ms fragment (2.8 pmol) with 12 μg of testes nuclear extract in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm of each dNTP. After incubation at 37 °C for 25 min, reactions were stopped by quickly freezing at -70 °C; followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels in 1× TAE buffer. In some experiments, increasing amounts (0.01-1 μg) of purified histone H1 (H1) (Roche Applied Science) were added to the reactions. In other assays, the same amounts of H1 were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 1 μg of recombinant prothymosin α (ProTα), and then this mixture was added to the reaction. Recombinant ProTα (22Vega F. Vidal A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Domínguez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10147-10152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Fernando Domínguez. In the experiments with different DNA/protein ratios, 3 ng (5.6 fmol) of end-labeled Ms fragment (∼84000 cpm) plus increasing amounts of unlabeled Ms fragment (0-2.8 pmol) were employed as substrate. In these assays, agarose gels were blotted onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences), followed by autoradiography. In previous works, we have shown that the human minisatellite MsH42 region is able to enhance intramolecular homologous recombination in vitro (19Boán F. Rodríguez J.M. Gómez-Márquez J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Boán F. Rodíguez J.M. Mouriño S. Blanco M.G. Viñas A. Sánchez L. Gómez-Márquez J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Because many recombinational processes are triggered by DNA damage, we set up an in vitro DNA cleavage assay to study where DNA lesions could be taking place in the MsH42 region. To this end, we incubated the Ms fragment that contains the minisatellite MsH42 plus its flanking sequences with rat testes nuclear extracts. After incubation, the processed DNA was separated by electrophoresis in agarose gels. As shown in Fig. 1 (third lane from the left), we obtained a pattern of smaller fragments derived from the nuclease activity on the Ms substrate, and the degree of end ligation was almost negligible. When these results are compared with those obtained in similar assays designed to study DNA end-joining, there is a striking difference: most of the end-joining assays employed to analyze NHEJ show a remarkable absence of DNA degradation (10Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Zhong Q. Boyer T.G. Chen P-L. Lee W-H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11756-11764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), indicating that the DNA is somehow protected against the endogenous nuclease activities, whereas this protection is undetectable in our assay. We first investigated whether under our in vitro assay conditions we could promote multimerization by protecting the Ms fragment. To obtain this protection, we incorporated into the reaction mixture growing amounts of H1, which enhances intermolecular end ligation in vitro (23Yamanaka S. Katayama E. Yoshioka K. Nagaki S. Yoshida M. Teraoka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 292: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments revealed that the addition of increasing amounts of H1 produces a complete switch in the result of the assay, blocking DNA degradation and enhancing DNA multimerization (Fig. 1). It is worth noting that at elevated concentrations of H1 the end ligation of the Ms fragment is reduced (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 10), suggesting that the DNA fragment becomes totally covered by the histone, avoiding its multimerization. To corroborate the effect of H1 on the DNA cleavage assay, we carried out experiments in which this protein was preincubated with ProTα before its addition to the reaction mixture. Because ProTα was demonstrated to be an H1-binding protein (24Gómez-Márquez J. Rodríguez P. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Karetsou Z Sandaltzopoulos R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 3: 1241-1246Google Scholar), it was expected that the addition of this protein would counteract the protection of the DNA fragment by H1. Fig. 2 shows that the presence of ProTα provoked a rise in the quantity of H1 needed to avoid the formation of the cleavage products as well as the hindrance to its multimerization (Fig. 2, compare with same amounts of H1 in Fig. 1). In our standard assay, the DNA/ratio employed was 234 fmol/μg protein, whereas in similar assays (10Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Zhong Q. Boyer T.G. Chen P-L. Lee W-H. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3966-3970PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pospiech H. Rytkönen A.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11756-11764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) it was much lower (0.25-5.8 fmol/μg protein). If we take into consideration the results obtained in each type of assay, multimerization versus degradation, with the different quantities of DNA substrate, a paradox emerges: lower amounts of DNA become multimerized instead of degraded and higher amounts of DNA are degraded rather than multimerized. The results obtained with H1 provide the clue to explain this apparent paradox. Thus, low amounts of DNA substrate would be protected against degradation by the DNA-binding proteins of the extract, whereas protection becomes insignificant when large quantities of DNA are present. To verify this hypothesis, several reactions with different DNA substrate/protein ratios were carried out by adding increasing amounts of unlabeled Ms fragment (0-2.8 pmol) with 3 ng (5.6 fmol) of end-labeled Ms fragment (Fig. 3). The DNA/protein ratio in these reactions ranges from 0.47 to 234 fmol of Ms fragment/μg of protein nuclear extract. The results of these experiments showed that reactions with the lower DNA/protein ratio, similar to that used in several end-joining assays (10Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The reactions with a high DNA/protein ratio, similar to the standard assay, show a pattern of bands derived from specific nuclease activities and much less end-joining activity. Altogether, these results are bona fide proof that the variation of the DNA/protein ratio in the in vitro assay is enough to switch the outcome of the experiment from a DNA cleavage assay to a typical end-joining assay. Therefore, when the DNA/protein ratio is sufficiently low, the DNA-binding proteins in the nuclear extract are able to cover the DNA substrate, thus avoiding its degradation. In vitro end-joining assays are a widely employed technique to study the mechanisms of NHEJ (8North P. Ganesh A. Thacker J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9068-9075Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have developed an in vitro assay to study the specific cleavage of a minisatellite-containing DNA fragment by the nuclear extract. We have shown that the interaction between the DNA substrate and H1 in our assay drastically modifies the result of the experiment. The binding of H1 to DNA not only abrogates the nuclease activity but also promotes its linear multimerization (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with previous work reporting that H1 enhances DSB-ligation reactions, probably facilitating the end to end connection of DNA molecules by the formation of long nucleoprotein complexes that lead to DNA assembled structures (23Yamanaka S. Katayama E. Yoshioka K. Nagaki S. Yoshida M. Teraoka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 292: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because these nucleoprotein complexes are probably unsuitable substrates for the degradation activity, multimerization goes along with DNA protection. Because ProTα is able to bind free H1 (25Karetsou Z Sandaltzopoulos R. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Lai C.-Y. Tsolas O. Becker P.B. Papamarcaki T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3111-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), its addition provokes a decrease in the effective concentration of H1 that can associate to the DNA fragment. The weakening of the H1 effect produced by preincubation with ProTα confirms the protective role played by H1 in our assays (Fig. 2). The mild attenuation of the H1 effect produced by ProTα could be explained because this protein may not be capable of releasing H1 bound to DNA (25Karetsou Z Sandaltzopoulos R. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Lai C.-Y. Tsolas O. Becker P.B. Papamarcaki T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3111-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and hence all H1 molecules that get joined to DNA remain stably associated to it. The results presented here provide strong evidence that DNA-binding proteins in the cell-free extracts are protecting DNA from degradation and favoring its ligation in end-joining/DNA cleavage assays. HMGB1 and HMGB2 are abundant nuclear proteins that bind to the nucleosome linker DNA of the chromatin in a competitive manner with H1 (27Ogawa Y. Aizawa S. Shirakawa H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9272-9280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been reported that these proteins stimulate in vitro DSB-ligation reactions (28Nagaki S. Yamamoto M. Yumoto Y. Shirakawa H. Yoshida M. Teraoka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1998; 246: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), promoting intramolecular rather than intermolecular ligation (23Yamanaka S. Katayama E. Yoshioka K. Nagaki S. Yoshida M. Teraoka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002; 292: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with our results in the experiments with a low DNA/protein ratio (Fig. 3). Thus, suppression of DNA degradation is achieved and intramolecular ligation is predominant, suggesting that nuclear DNA-binding proteins different from H1 may be involved in the protection of DNA against nuclease activity in these assays. The fact that DNA protection appears at low DNA/protein ratios indicates the shielding of DNA against nucleases is fully accomplished only if enough protein is present per DNA molecule. The DNA/protein ratio in several end-joining assays (10Baumann P. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14066-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Zhong Q. Boyer T.G.

The low DNA/protein ratio of 0.47 fmol of DNA/μg protein employed in this work is a value included within such a range. All these values are much lower than those in our standard assays (234 fmol of Ms fragment/μg protein extract). The apparent paradox of the absence of DNA degradation in the end-joining assays then becomes understandable. Degradation of the DNA in these assays with a low DNA/protein ratio is prevented by the binding of several proteins that act as a barrier for the nuclease activities present in the cell-free extract. Moreover, depending on the kind of proteins that associate to DNA, intra- and/or intermolecular end ligation can be obtained. At intermediate DNA/protein ratios, the concentration of DNA-binding proteins is too small to protect completely all the DNA molecules, although the accumulation of specific DNA cleavage products is interfered. Hence, these intermediate ratios are not optimal for the analysis of DNA end ligation or DNA fragmentation. In reactions with a high DNA/protein ratio, DNA is practically unprotected and substantial nuclease activity arises. Finally, the present results open up a new perspective for the interpretation of end-joining in vitro assays and show that the variation in the DNA/protein ratio switches the experimental system from a cleavage assay to an end-joining assay.
