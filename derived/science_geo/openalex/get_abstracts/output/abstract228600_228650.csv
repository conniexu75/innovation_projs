https://openalex.org/W2008165628,"Bile acid homeostasis is tightly controlled by the feedback mechanism in which an atypical orphan nuclear receptor (NR) small heterodimer partner (SHP) inactivates several NRs such as liver receptor homologue-1 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4. Although NRs have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of gluconeogenic genes, the effect of bile acids on gluconeogenic gene expression remained unknown. Here, we report that bile acids inhibit the expression of gluconeogenic genes, including glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and fructose 1,6-bis phosphatase in an SHP-dependent fashion. Cholic acid diet decreased the mRNA levels of these gluconeogenic enzymes, whereas those of SHP were increased. Reporter assays demonstrated that the promoter activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and fructose 1,6-bis phosphatase via hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, or that of G6Pase via the forkhead transcription factor Foxo1, was down-regulated by treatment with chenodeoxicholic acid and with transfected SHP. Remarkably, Foxo1 interacted with SHP in vivo and in vitro, which led to the repression of Foxo1-mediated G6Pase transcription by competition with a coactivator cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which bile acids regulate gluconeogenic gene expression via an SHP-dependent regulatory pathway.

During periods of fasting, once the glucagon signal is transmitted into the cells, the PEPCK gene is immediately up-regulated by activation of protein kinase A and following phosphorylation of CREB (7Hanson R.W.

However, little is known about transcriptional regulation of the FBP1 gene. Bile acid metabolism plays a critical role for the elimination of excess cholesterol in the liver. This pathway is achieved via transcriptional regulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid biosynthesis (10Russell D.W. Setchell K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 11Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Upon bile acid stimulation, a member of nuclear receptors (NRs), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), potently activates transcription of the small heterodimer partner, SHP, which is an atypical orphan NR lacking a DNA-binding domain. Elevated SHP heterodimerizes and inactivates the liver receptor homologue-1 that is a transactivator of the CYP7A1 gene, eventually inhibiting bile acid production by repressing CYP7A1 transcription (12Lu T.T.

SHP also antagonizes the functions of several NRs, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (14Borgius L.J. Steffensen K.R. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol.

Given the important roles for GR and HNF-4 in controlling gluconeogenesis, these studies suggested that bile acid metabolism might link to glucose homeostasis. In this study, we show that bile acids efficiently suppress the mRNA levels and promoter activities of G6Pase, PEPCK, and FBP1 in mouse liver and HepG2 cells, respectively. Remarkably, overexpression of SHP represses the gluconeogenic gene promoters by disrupting the association of CBP-Foxo1 or CBP-HNF-4. Our findings provide evidence that bile acids repress gluconeogenic gene transcription via the effect of the negative nuclear receptor SHP on HNF-4 or Foxo1. Animal Studies—Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (CLEA) were maintained on a fixed artificial light cycle (12 h of light and 12 of dark) on a standard diet or a diet supplemented with 1% cholic acid for 7 days. Both groups were allowed free access to water. Mice were sacrificed 12 h after fasting, and the livers were removed for Northern blot analysis. Cloning and Plasmids—The mouse Foxo1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 tagged with the FLAG epitope (16Hatta M. Daitoku H. Matsuzaki H. Deyama Y. Yoshimura Y. Suzuki K. Matsumoto A. Fukamizu A. Int. J.

Genomic fragments encompassing the human glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and fluctose-1,6-bis-phosphatase (FBP1) promoters extending from -826 to +7 bp, -600 to +71 bp, and -578 to +73 bp relative to the transcription sites, respectively, were subcloned into the BglII site of the promoterless pPicaGene-Basic vector II luciferase reporter gene vector (Toyo-Inki) to generate G6Pase-, PEPCK-, and FBP1-promoter-luc constructs. A series of PEPCK and G6Pase deletion fragments were generated by PCR and subcloned into pPicaGene-Basic vector II. PEPCK-gAF1 and G6Pase-mtIRS-luc reporter plasmids were generated by PCR mutagenesis. The 3×IRS-MLP-luc and 5×UAS-MLP-luc plasmids have been described previously (19Fukuoka M. Daitoku H. Hatta M.

A series of SHP deletion fragments were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-5× vector (Amersham Biosciences). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from mouse livers using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene), and the aliquots (10 μg) were pooled from eight mice per diet. After electrophoresis, RNA was blotted onto GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and subsequently hybridized with specific 32P-labeled cDNA probes. Relative expression levels were analyzed by utilizing a Typhoon 8600 (Molecular Dynamics) and standardized against β-actin controls. Mouse G6Pase (14-682 bp, a kind gift from Dr. Atsushi Miyajima), mouse PEPCK (1119-1869 bp), mouse FBP1 (221-1219 bp), and human SHP (1-774 bp) were used as hybridization probes. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Reporter Gene Assays—HepG2 and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and transfections were performed by FuGENE6 reagents (Roche Applied Science). pRSV or pSV40-β-galactosidase plasmid was included in each transfection experiment to control for the efficiency of transfection. To ensure equal DNA amounts, empty plasmids were added in each transfection. After transfection, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24-48 h. If necessary, 5 h after transfection, medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence or absence of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; Sigma) at the indicated concentrations, and cells were further incubated for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured with Wallac (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and normalized for β-galactosidase activity in the same sample. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—HEK293T cells were cotransfected with FLAG-Foxo1 or FLAG-HNF-4 and HA-SHP expression plasmids using FuGENE6 reagents. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 18 h and then lysed in the buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). The cell extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Sigma) for 3 h. Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and incubation continued for a further 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by electrotransfer onto polyvinylidine fluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), the membrane was probed with anti-FLAG (M2), anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), anti-HA high affinity (3F10; Roche Applied Science), or anti-CBP-CT (Upstate) antibodies and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence regents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GST Pull-down Assays—GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Promega) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST pull-down assays were performed by incubating cell extracts from HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-Foxo1 or HA-SHP with equal amounts of various GST-Foxo1 or GST-SHP proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Bile Acids Repress Gluconeogenic Gene Promoter Activities—To evaluate the effects of bile acids on hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression in vivo, C57BL/6J mice were treated for 7 days with a diet containing cholic acid, which is known to be a natural ligand of the nuclear receptor FXR (23Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). After overnight fasting, total RNA was isolated from the liver and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Consistent with previous reports (12Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A.

On the other hand, the cholic acid diet substantially reduced the mRNA levels of gluconeogenic genes, including G6Pase, PEPCK, and FBP1 (Fig. 1A). To elucidate the mechanism by which cholic acid down-regulates gluconeogenic gene expression, we performed reporter assays using human G6Pase-, PEPCK-, and FBP1-promoter-luciferase constructs. HepG2 cells were transfected with each reporter construct and then treated with increasing concentrations of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), which is a primary bile acid and induces SHP via the FXR-dependent pathway (12Lu T.T.

As expected from the results in mice (Fig. 1A), CDCA led to a dose-dependent decrease in the three reporter gene activities (Fig. 1B, left), whereas no difference was observed in SV40 promoter activity (Fig. 1B, right). These results indicate that bile acids repress gluconeogenic gene expression in the transcriptional level. Bile Acid-responsible Elements Are Identified in PEPCK and G6Pase Promoters—Next, we sought to address the bile acid-responsible element(s) in the PEPCK and G6Pase promoters. The effect of CDCA on the 5′-deletions of the human PEPCK and G6Pase promoters was assayed in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2, A and B, left panels). As shown in Fig. 2A, right, CDCA reduced the activity of the PEPCK promoter-containing sequence -600 to +7 (PEPCK/-600-luc). Although the promoter activity of 5′-deletion to -480 (PEPCK/-480-luc) was still repressed by CDCA treatment, this repressive effect was significantly diminished in the PEPCK/-335-luc construct, suggesting that the sequence -480 to -335 in the PEPCK promoter appears to contain the putative element, which is negatively regulated by CDCA. Similarly, CDCA repressed the G6Pase/-827-luc, G6Pase/-499-luc, and G6Pase/-237-luc constructs, but not the G6Pase/-154-luc construct (Fig. 2B, right), suggesting that the sequence -237 to -154 includes the bile acid response element in the G6Pase promoter. CDCA Represses Gluconeogenic Gene Promoter Activities via HNF-4 or Foxo1—Interestingly, the bile acid response elements identified in the PEPCK and G6Pase promoters overlap with the associate factor 1 (AF1) region (-441 to -410, PEPCK) and the insulin response sequence (IRS) (-189 to -157, G6Pase), respectively (Fig. 3A) (7Hanson R.W.

It has been shown that the AF1 region contains direct repeat sequences that correspond to a binding site for nuclear receptor HNF-4 (28Hall R.K. Sladek F.M. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the IRS consensus has been identified as the binding sites for the forkhead transcription factor, Foxo1 (29Ayala J.E. Streeper R.S. Desgrosellier J.S. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A.

Because both of the transcription factors are involved in maintenance of gluconeogenic gene expression (1Nakae J. Biggs III, W.H. Kitamura T. Cavenee W.K. Wright C.V. Arden K.C. Accili D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 5Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that bile acids may repress gluconeogenic gene promoter activities through HNF-4- or Foxo1-mediated transcriptions. To test this possibility, we generated the two types of mutated reporters. In the human PEPCK promoter, the direct repeat motif in the AF1 region was converted to the GAL4 recognition site (upstream activation sequence, UAS) (Fig. 3A, left). Alternatively, the consensus sequences of IRSs were mutated in the human G6Pase promoter (Fig. 3B, left). After confirming that gAF1-luc largely diminishes transactivation by HNF-4 and the mtIRS-luc construct completely abolishes the response to Foxo1 (data not shown), we investigated whether AF1 in the PEPCK or IRS in the G6Pase promoters coincides with bile acid response elements. Compared with the PEPCK and G6Pase wild-type reporters, CDCA-dependent repression was substantially abrogated in the gAF1 and mtIRS constructs (Fig. 3, A and B, right panels). These findings clearly indicated that HNF-4 and Foxo1 are target transcription factors for CDCA-dependent repression in gluconeogenic gene expression. To further clarify the repressive mechanism of CDCA, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with PEPCK- or FBP1-promoter-luciferase constructs together with HNF-4 expression plasmid following incubation with CDCA. In the absence of CDCA, HNF-4 stimulated the promoter activities of PEPCK and FBP1 5-7-fold, whereas CDCA drastically inhibited HNF-4-mediated transactivation of the promoters (Fig. 3C). Likewise, in the G6Pase promoter, CDCA efficiently inhibited Foxo1-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results suggest that CDCA down-regulates the transactivation function of HNF-4 and Foxo1 in gluconeogenic gene expressions. SHP Represses Gluconeogenic Gene Promoter Activities via HNF-4 or Foxo1—Bile acids have been shown to induce SHP protein via the FXR-dependent pathway (12Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K.

As shown in Fig. 4A, FXR (W469A) canceled repression by CDCA in these promoter activities, suggesting that CDCA repressed gluconeogenic gene transcription via FXR-dependent pathway. Moreover, we confirmed that the mRNA levels of SHP are increased by CDCA in HepG2 cells (32Shimamoto Y. Ishida J. Yamagata K. Saito T. Kato H. Matsuoka T. Hirota K. Daitoku H. Nangaku M. Fujii H. Takeda J. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to examine the effects of SHP on the gluconeogenic gene promoters. To this end, increasing amounts of SHP expression plasmids were cotransfected into HepG2 cells together with the G6Pase-, PEPCK-, and FBP1-promoter reporter constructs. As shown in Fig. 4B, SHP significantly repressed the gluconeogenic gene promoters in a dose-dependent manner (left panel), whereas SHP had no effect on SV40 promoter activity (right panel). Several studies have reported that bile acids repress human CYP8B1 and CYP27A1 transcription by attenuating the transactivation activity of HNF-4 through the interaction with SHP (33Chen W. Chiang J.Y. Gene. 2003; 313: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Zhang M. Chiang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41690-41699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, our recent study demonstrated that bile acids repress HNF-4-mediated human angiotensinogen gene expression in an SHP-dependent manner (32Shimamoto Y. Ishida J. Yamagata K. Saito T. Kato H. Matsuoka T. Hirota K. Daitoku H. Nangaku M. Fujii H. Takeda J. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore explored whether SHP could antagonize HNF-4-mediated gluconeogenic gene transcription. HNF-4 and increasing amounts of SHP expression plasmids were cotransfected into HepG2 cells together with the PEPCK- and FBP1-promoter-luc plasmids. As shown in Fig. 4C, SHP completely inhibited HNF-4-induced activation of the PEPCK and FBP1 promoters. Moreover, we examined the effect of SHP on the Foxo1-mediated G6Pase transcription. As expected, SHP potently repressed Foxo1-stimulated G6Pase promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that bile acids down-regulate the promoter activity of PEPCK and FBP1 via HNF4 or that of G6Pase via Foxo1 in an SHP-dependent fashion. Foxo1 Interacts with SHP in Vivo and in Vitro—To further confirm whether Foxo1 is a regulatory target whereby bile acids inhibit the G6Pase promoter, additional reporter assays were conducted using a 3×IRS model promoter construct that contains the cognate Foxo1 binding elements. Similar to that observed on the G6Pase promoter (Fig. 4, C and D), the treatment of CDCA and the cotransfection of SHP attenuated the activity of the 3×IRS model promoter (Fig. 5, A and B). These data strongly indicated that Foxo1 is a direct target of SHP. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the SHP-dependent inhibition of Foxo1 activity, we used coimmunoprecipitation assays to test whether Foxo1 interacts with SHP. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with FLAG-Foxo1 with or without HA-SHP expression plasmids. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-FLAG antibody, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5C, the Foxo1-SHP complexes were readily detected when both FLAG-Foxo1 and HA-SHP were cotransfected, indicating that Foxo1 can associate with SHP in vivo.To further determine which portions of Foxo1 and SHP are essential for their interactions, GST pull-down assays were conducted using HA-SHP transfected into HEK293T cells and several deletion mutants of GST-Foxo1 protein expressed in bacteria (Fig. 5D, upper panel). As illustrated in Fig. 5D, lower panel, SHP tightly bound the C terminus of Foxo1 (410-652 amino acids). Alternatively, Foxo1 exclusively bound the N terminus of SHP (1-91 amino acids) (Fig. 5E). These data demonstrate that Foxo1 is a target of SHP in vivo and in vitro. SHP Displaces CBP by Competing for Interaction with Foxo1—To elucidate the mechanism underlying the repression of Foxo1-mediated transcription by SHP, we employed mammalian one-hybrid analysis using the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the C terminus of Foxo1 (GAL4-Foxo1-CT). This region contains the minimum transactivation domain of Foxo1 (35Yeagley D. Guo S. Unterman T. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33705-33710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and the binding region of p300 (36Perrot V. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26111-26119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we confirmed that it corresponds to the binding region of CBP 2H. Daitoku and A. Fukamizu, unpublished data. and SHP (Fig. 5E). Thus, these observations raised the possibility that SHP may compete with the interaction of Foxo1 and CBP. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a GAL4 reporter gene containing the five GAL4 recognition sites upstream of the adenovirus major late promoter (5×UAS-MLP-luc) and expression plasmids for either the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4-DBD) as a negative control or GAL4-Foxo1-CT. Significantly, CDCA and SHP inhibited transactivation of GAL4-Foxo1-CT (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that SHP interfered with Foxo1 transactivation, probably by dissociating CBP from Foxo1. To verify this possibility, we investigated whether SHP prevents physical interaction between Foxo1 and CBP. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with FLAG-Foxo1 together with increasing amounts of SHP expression plasmid, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 6C). As shown in Fig. 6C, SHP interfered with the binding of Foxo1 to endogenous CBP in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that disruption of the Foxo1-CBP complex by SHP led to attenuating Foxo1-mediated transactivation. SHP Displaces CBP by Competing for Interaction with HNF-4 —Finally, we investigated how SHP represses HNF-4-mediated promoter activities. Because SHP competes with the association between HNF-4 and a coactivator, SRC-3 (15Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), we performed mammalian one-hybrid analysis using the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to HNF-4 (GAL4-HNF-4). HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a 5×UAS-MLP-luc and expression plasmids for either the GAL4-DBD or GAL4-HNF-4. Significantly, SHP inhibited GAL4-HNF-4-mediated promoter activity (Fig. 7A), suggesting that SHP interfered with HNF-4 transactivation, probably by dissociating coactivators. Because it was reported that HNF-4 interacts with CBP (20Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miyagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Dell H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9013-9021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we tested whether SHP could compete with the interaction of HNF-4 with CBP. As shown in Fig. 7A, CBP coactivated HNF-4-dependent reporter activities. Interestingly, we found that SHP interferes with CBP-mediated HNF-4 transactivation (Fig. 7A). To further investigate the mechanism by which SHP suppresses HNF-4-mediated transactivation, we investigated whether SHP prevents the physical interaction of HNF-4 with CBP. To this end, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with FLAG-HNF-4 together with empty vector or SHP expression plasmid and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 7B). As shown in Fig. 7B, SHP interfered with the binding of HNF-4 to endogenous CBP in vivo. These findings suggest that SHP inhibits HNF-4-mediated transactivation of PEPCK and FBP1 promoters by disrupting the HNF-4-CBP complex. In the present study, we have made four major findings. First, bile acids down-regulate G6Pase, PEPCK, and FBP1 gene expression in mice (Fig. 1). Second, CDCA and SHP repress HNF-4- or Foxo1-stimulated promoter activities of the gluconeogenic genes (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Third, SHP antagonizes the transactivation function of Foxo1 through direct interaction (Fig. 5). Finally, the mechanism underlying SHP-dependent inactivation of Foxo1 and HNF-4 is due to the dissociation of CBP from them (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, A and B). Based on these results and previous reports in which bile acids bind and activate the FXR/RXR heterodimer that leads to the induction of SHP (12Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A.

Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar), we summarize a model for bile acid-mediated down-regulation of the gluconeogenic genes via induced SHP (Fig. 7C). According to this model, the increased levels of SHP displace CBP by competing for interaction with Foxo1 on the G6Pase promoter and HNF-4 on the PEPCK and FBP1 promoters. More recently, De Fabiani et al. (38De Fabiani E. Mitro N. Gilardi F. Caruso D. Galli G. Crestani M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39124-39132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) have shown that bile acids repress CYP7A1 and PEPCK gene expression. They, however, argued that the suppressive effect was accomplished by an SHP-independent dissociation of the HNF-4-coactivator complex. Compared with their study, we showed that bile acids repressed the expression of the three gluconeogenic genes in an SHP-dependent manner. Furthermore, SHP directly targeted and inhibited transactivating abilities of Foxo1, which is a key regulator of G6Pase gene transcription (3Schmoll D. Walker K.S. Alessi D.R. Grempler R. Burchell A. Guo S. Walther R. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36324-36333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Combined with their findings and ours, it seems likely that there are at least two distinct pathways in bile acid-dependent suppression of gluconeogenic gene expression through SHP-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Downstream of the insulin-signaling pathway, the Foxo subfamily members are phosphorylated by protein kinase B, which leads to their exclusion from the nucleus (39Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J.

In addition to phosphorylation, we previously reported that Foxo factors are finely regulated by multiple modifications, namely acetylation (19Fukuoka M. Daitoku H. Hatta M. Matsuzaki H. Umemura S. Fukamizu A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 12: 503-508PubMed Google Scholar) and ubiquitination (41Matsuzaki H. Daitoku H. Hatta M. Tanaka K. Fukamizu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11285-11290Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). These modifications cause transcriptional repression (19Fukuoka M. Daitoku H. Hatta M. Matsuzaki H. Umemura S. Fukamizu A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 12: 503-508PubMed Google Scholar) or proteasomal degradation in Foxo proteins (41Matsuzaki H. Daitoku H. Hatta M. Tanaka K. Fukamizu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Valerie K. Sealy L. Engelhardt J.F. Grant S. Hylemon P.B. Dent P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3052-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that bile acids regulate C/EBPβ, CREB, and c-Jun function by their phosphorylation through extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathways. In view of these findings, it will be of interest to verify the additional possibility that bile acids can stimulate the phosphorylation, acetylation, or ubiquitination of Foxo1 via a signal-dependent cascade. Excessive hepatic glucose production by gluconeogenesis is a major contributor of both fasting hyperglycemia and exaggerated postprandial hyperglycemia. In vivo genetic analyses have shown that Foxo1 regulates the expression of G6Pase and PEPCK genes in response to insulin (1Nakae J. Biggs III, W.H. Kitamura T. Cavenee W.K. Wright C.V. Arden K.C. Accili D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). In addition, PGC-1 activates an entire program of key gluconeogenic enzymes and is controlled by Foxo1 in an insulin-dependent fashion (44Daitoku H. Yamagata K. Matsuzaki H. Hatta M. Fukamizu A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Hence, the suppression of gluconeogenesis remains a very attractive pharmaceutical target in diabetes (45Saltiel A.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Thus, our finding that bile acids inhibit expression of gluconeogenic genes for PEPCK, FBP1, and G6Pase through the interaction of SHP with HNF-4 or Foxo1 may provide a step toward the discovery of an antidiabetic drug to control hepatic gluconeogenesis. We thank Professor Atsushi Miyajima (University of Tokyo), Professor Jun Takeda (Gunma University), and Professor Hiroshi Fujii (Niigata University) for providing mouse G6Pase cDNA, human SHP cDNA, and human FXR cDNA, respectively. We thank the Fukamizu laboratory members for sharing unpublished data and critical comments."
https://openalex.org/W1986843840,"A conflict in cell cycle progression or DNA damage can lead to mitotic catastrophe when the DNA structure checkpoints are inactivated, for instance when the checkpoint kinase Chk2 is inhibited. Here we show that in such conditions, cells die during the metaphase of the cell cycle, as a result of caspase activation and subsequent mitochondrial damage. Molecular ordering of these phenomena reveals that mitotic catastrophe occurs in a p53-independent manner and involves a primary activation of caspase-2, upstream of cytochrome c release, followed by caspase-3 activation and chromatin condensation. Suppression of caspase-2 by RNA interference or pseudosubstrate inhibitors as well as blockade of the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization prevent the mitotic catastrophe and allow cells to further proceed the cell cycle beyond the metaphase, leading to asymmetric cell division. Heterokarya generated by the fusion of nonsynchronized cells can be driven to divide into three or more daughter cells when Chk2 and caspases are simultaneously inhibited. Such multipolar divisions, resulting from suppressed mitotic catastrophe, lead to the asymmetric distribution of cytoplasm (anisocytosis), DNA (anisokaryosis) and chromosomes (aneuploidy). Similarly, in a model of DNA damage-induced mitotic catastrophe, suppression of apoptosis leads to the generation of aneuploid cells. Our findings delineate a molecular pathway through which DNA damage, failure to arrest the cell cycle and inhibition of apoptosis can favor the occurrence of cytogenetic abnormalities that are likely to participate in oncogenesis."

This work is focused on the extracellular function of S100A4, in particular its involvement in tumor-stroma interplay in VMR (mouse adenocarcinoma cell line) tumor cells, which exhibit stroma-dependent metastatic phenotype. We demonstrated the reciprocal influence of tumor and stroma cells where tumor cells stimulate S100A4 secretion from fibroblasts in culture.

https://openalex.org/W1999731248,"We examined the mechanism by which estrogen regulates telomerase activity in Caov-3 human ovarian cancer cell lines, which express ER, to determine whether the regulation affects the expression and/or phosphorylation of the telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT). 17β-Estradiol (E2) induced telomerase activity and hTERT expression. Transient expression assays using luciferase reporter plasmids containing various fragments of hTERT promoter showed that the estrogen-responsive element appeared to be partially responsible for the E2-induced activation of the hTERT promoter. Either pretreatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, or transfection with a dominant-negative Akt attenuated the E2-induced activation of the hTERT promoter. In addition, estrogen induced the phosphorylation of IκB inhibitor protein via the Akt cascade, and cotransfection with a dominant-negative subunit of NFκB attenuated the response of the ERE-deleted hTERT promoter to E2. Moreover, E2 induced the phosphorylation of hTERT, the association of 14-3-3 protein and NFκB with hTERT, and nuclear accumulation of hTERT in an Akt-dependent manner. These results indicate that E2 induces telomerase activity not only by transcriptional regulation of hTERT via an ERE-dependent mechanism and a PI3K/Akt/NFκB cascade, but also by post-transcriptional regulation via Akt-dependent phosphorylation of hTERT. Thus, the phosphorylation of Akt is a key event in the induction of telomerase activity by E2 in human ovarian cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2043025574,"The POU transcription factor Oct-4 is a master regulator affecting the fate of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. However, the precise mechanisms by which the activation and expression of Oct-4 are regulated still remain to be elucidated. We describe here a novel murine ubiquitin ligase, Wwp2, that specifically interacts with Oct-4 and promotes its ubiquitination both in vivo and in vitro. Remarkably, the expression of a catalytically inactive point mutant of Wwp2 abolishes Oct-4 ubiquitination. Moreover, Wwp2 promotes Oct-4 degradation in the presence of overexpressed ubiquitin. The degradation is blocked by treatment with proteasome inhibitor. Fusion of a single ubiquitin to Oct-4 inactivates its transcriptional activity in a heterologous Oct-4-driven reporter system. Furthermore, overexpression of Wwp2 in embryonic stem cells significantly reduces the Oct-4-transcriptional activities. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that Oct-4 can be post-translationally modified by ubiquitination and that this modification dramatically suppresses its transcriptional activity.

However, Oct-4 is absent from all of the differentiated somatic cell types in vitro and in vivo (5Yeom Y. Fuhrman G. Ovitt C.E. Brehm A. Ohbo K. Gross M. Hubner K. Scholer H.R. Development. 1996; 122: 881-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brehm A. Ovitt C.E. Scholer H.R. APMIS. 1998; 106: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting its important role in maintaining cellular pluripotency. The deletion of Oct-4 in mice causes an early lethality at 3.5 days of gestation. The inner cell mass cells are not pluripotent. Instead, cells at the morula stage differentiate into a trophectodermal lineage (7Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Scholer H.R. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Thus, Oct-4 has an essential function in the establishment of the pluripotential inner cell mass lineage in preimplantation development. Further investigation via conditional repression and expression of Oct-4 in ES cells demonstrates that the level of Oct-4 expression governs the developmental fate of ES cells (8Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar). Therefore, Oct-4 transcription factor can be considered as a master regulator for initiation, maintenance, and differentiation of pluripotent cells (9Niwa H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). There has to be tight regulation of Oct-4 expression and activity for it to maintain the pluripotent state of ES cell. However, it is not known how such tight regulation is realized in vivo. A large number of recent findings have highlighted the close relationship between transcription regulation and the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome pathway (10Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 11Lipford J.R. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The best-studied function of ubiquitination is its role in protein degradation where polyubiquitinated proteins are recognized by the 26 S proteasome and are degraded rapidly (12Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 13Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). However, other functions for Ub are being discovered at a rapid rate (14Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15Freiman R.N. Tjian R. Cell. 2003; 112: 11-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 16Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is regulated by a cascade of enzymatic reactions resulting in the covalent addition of Ub, a 76 amino acid polypeptide, to target proteins. Ub is first activated by the E1 Ub-activating enzyme in an ATP-dependent reaction, resulting in thioester bond formation between a specific cysteine of the enzyme and the carboxyl terminus of Ub. The activated Ub is then transferred to one of many different E2s (Ub-conjugating enzyme or Ub-carrier enzyme). E2 enzymes then mediate the transfer of Ub to the target protein directly or to E3 Ub protein ligases, which are responsible for substrate recognition and for promoting Ub ligation to the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues on a substrate. The E3 ligases are critical components that are needed to determine the enzymatic specificity in the Ub cascade as a result of direct interaction with substrates (13Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Two distinct E3 families have now been identified. One family of E3 ligases is RING finger E3, which is believed to mediate the direct transfer of Ub from E2 to substrates (13Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 17Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Members of the other family of E3 Ub ligases accept activated Ub from E2 and form a thioester intermediate with Ub. The first identified member of the latter family is E6-associated protein, which mediates polyubiquitination of p53 (18Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 19Rolfe M. Beer-Romero P. Glass S. Eckstein J. Berdo I. Theodoras A. Pagano M. Draetta G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3264-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Other members of this family include Nedd4 and related Nedd4-like proteins (20Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 166-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These all have a carboxyl-terminal domain termed HECT (for homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain, which provides the Ub ligase enzyme activity. E3 ligases of Nedd4 family contain 2-4 tryptophan-based WW domains, which consist of 35-40 amino acids and bind certain proteins containing pro-line-rich motifs. The WW domains have been reported in a wide variety of proteins of yeast, nematode, vertebrate, and mammalian origins and play a direct role in mediating specific and distinct protein-protein interactions (21Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 22Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2897-2907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We describe here a murine E3 Ub ligase, Wwp2, that can directly bind to Oct-4. This interaction occurs through WW domains of Wwp2. Wwp2 promotes ubiquitination of Oct-4 both in vitro and in vivo. The enzymatic activity of Wwp2 is dependent on the integrity of its HECT domain. Furthermore, overexpression of Wwp2 in embryonic stem cells significantly suppresses trans-activation activity of Oct-4. Importantly, Wwp2 expression is decreased in parallel with the decrease in Oct-4 expression when ES cells are induced into differentiation. These results suggest that Wwp2 may serve as a regulator of Oct-4-mediated functions in ES cells and open up a new avenue to understand how self-renewal and pluripotency are maintained in ES cells. Construction of Vectors—The cDNA sequences corresponding to the full-length proteins of Oct-4 and Wwp2 were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from 128 and D3 mouse ES cell lines (ATCC), respectively, and cloned into pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega). The sequences were then subcloned either into pET-30a(+) (Novagen) and pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) vectors for expression in bacteria or pCMVNot, pCB6-Not (kind gifts from R. Baer) and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) vectors for expression in mammalian cells. Amino acid residual mutants were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. Mouse Itch cDNA was a kind gift from N. G. Copeland. Hemagglutinin-Ub expression vector was a kind gift from D. Bohmann. To generate Ub-Oct-4 fusion protein expression vector, the cDNA sequence of full-length Ub (GenBank™ accession number AK080925) was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from the D3 mouse ES cell line. For expression of Wwp2 and Oct-4 in CGR8 ES cells (a kind gift from A. Smith), the cDNA sequences were cloned into a modified X-pPNT vector (24Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—The nuclear extract from F9 cells was prepared as described previously (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, 26Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against BC200N (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9 at 25 °C, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Fusion Protein Expression and GST Purification—GST and His fusion proteins were expressed and prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions from Amersham Biosciences and Novagen, respectively. GST or GST-Oct-4N (the amino-terminal residues 29-124 of Oct-4) proteins bound to glutathione immobilized on Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in equal molar amounts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2-4 mg of the nuclear extracts prepared as described above. The bound proteins and beads were washed and then eluted with 250 μl of glutathione elution buffer (Amersham Biosciences). The samples were suspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. The bands only present in GST-Oct-4N lane were cut off for mass spectrometry analysis. In-gel Digestion of Proteins and Capillary-High Pressure Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometric Analysis for Protein Identification—The protein in-gel digestion and protein identification by nano-high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry was carried out according to the procedures described previously (27Zhao Y. Zhang W. White M.A. Zhao Y. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 3751-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Northern and Western Blot Analyses—A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (Kingrace) was hybridized with digitoxin (DIG)-labeled cDNA probes of Wwp2 (682 bp of 302-983 of NM_025830.3). The equivalent loading of mRNA in each lane was confirmed by hybridization of the same blot with a DIG-labeled β-actin cDNA probe. Hybridization and detection were performed with a DIG-labeling and detection kit (Roche Applied Science). For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed as described previously (28Jin Y. Xu X. Yang M.C. Wei F. Ayi T.C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each supernatant was determined by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For experiments involving samples from transiently transfected cells, the cotransfected pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid (a kind gift from R. Baer) was used to normalize each sample. Western analysis was conducted by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The Western blot analysis was performed in at least three different experiments, and representative data are shown. Antibodies—Antibodies against Oct-4 and Wwp2 were raised in rabbits against the purified GST-Oct-4N fusion protein and GST-Wwp2 M (amino acid residues 140-274 of Wwp2), respectively. The rabbit polyclonal antisera were purified by sequential affinity chromatography on His-Oct-4N or His-Wwp2 M conjugated to CNBr-activated-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and HiTrap protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope (Sigma), the His epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the Ub epitope (Cell Signaling) were used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—HEK 293 cells (a kind gift from R. Baer) were cultured under standard condition and transfected with the calcium phosphate method. F9 cells were grown as suggested by ATCC. Mouse ES cell lines, CGR8, D3, and SS1 (a mouse ES cell line derived in our laboratory with standard method), were cultured as described previously (30Turksen K. Embryonic Stem Cells: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002Google Scholar). CGR8 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation and Pull-down Assay—For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were prepared in a low stringency buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with a specific antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose beads for another 1 h. The coimmunoprecipitation experiments of endogenous Oct-4 and Wwp2 from nuclear extract of F9 cells were performed as described previously (31Klenova E. Chernukhin I. Inoue T. Shamsuddin S. Norton J. Methods. 2002; 26: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For GST pull-down experiments, 0.5 μg of GST fusion proteins were incubated with 0.5 μg of His fusion proteins in 250 μl of TBS-N (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 2 h followed by the addition of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for another hour. The samples from immunoprecipitation or GST pull-down assays were analyzed by Western blot. Ubiquitination Assay in Vivo and in Vitro—For the assay in vivo, HEK 293 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pCMV-Oct-4, 2 μg of pCMV-FLAG-Wwp2, 4 μg of pMT 107 (vector for His6-Ub expression, a kind gift from D. Bohmann), and 2 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase. 36-48 h after transfection, cells were treated for 5 h with proteasome inhibitor (20 μm MG132 or Me2SO) before harvest and then were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaH2PO4, and 500 mm NaCl). After β-galactosidase activity was measured, the cell lysates were normalized and adjusted to a final concentration of 8 m urea and 10 mm imidazole. The ubiquitinated proteins were affinity-purified on nitrilotriacetic acid His-bind resin (Novagen), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Oct-4 antibody. In vitro ubiquitination assay was carried out by adding GST-Oct-4 (1 μg), rabbit E1 (50 ng, Calbiochem), His-Ub-carrier enzyme H7/6 (0.4 μg, Calbiochem), His-Ub (2 μg, Calbiochem), and GST-Wwp2 (0.5 μg) to ubiquitination buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) to a final volume of 30 μl. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 120 min and stopped by boiling in SDS loading buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Ubiquitinated proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with antibody against Ub or Oct-4. Luciferase Reporter Assays—HEK 293 or CGR8 ES cells (1 × 106 cells in a 60-mm dish) were transiently transfected with vectors as indicated in the figures. Luciferase activities in the samples were measured using a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity in each sample. The experiments were performed at least three times in duplicate setting. The data are shown as the mean ± S.D. Immunofluorescence Staining—Mouse ES cell lines, SS1, were seeded onto microscope slides with feeder cells grown in a 100-mm culture dish. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (28Jin Y. Xu X. Yang M.C. Wei F. Ayi T.C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12075-12080Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The stained cells were mounted under coverslips, and immunofluorescence was recorded using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2) and analyzed by Leica confocal software (TCS SP2, version 2.5.1104). Identification of Wwp2 as a Novel Murine Oct-4-interacting Protein—To identify Oct-4-associated proteins, we purified Oct-4-interacting proteins from F9-embryonal carcinoma cell line nuclear extract using GST-Oct-4N (residual 29-124 of Oct-4) affinity chromatography. One protein (∼100 kDa) was found to be GST-Oct-4N-specific and therefore was excised for mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometric analysis identified this protein as the product of murine Riken cDNA 1300010006 gene (NP_080106, WW domain-containing protein 2). Researching the data base and performing reverse transcriptase-PCR, we obtained a cDNA clone of 2703 bp from mouse D3 ES cell line. The sequence includes an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 870 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 98.7 kDa. The predicted protein contains a protein kinase C conserved region 2 (C2 domain) at its amino terminus and a HECT domain at its carboxyl terminus. In addition, there are four WW domains between the C2 and HECT domains (Fig. 1B). The amino acid sequence is 96% identical to a human Nedd-4-like Ub-protein ligase, which is termed WW domain-containing protein 2, WWP2 (GenBank™ accession number NP_008945) (22Pirozzi G. McConnell S.J. Uveges A.J. Carter J.M. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Fowlkes D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14611-14616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because of the sequence similarity, we concluded that this novel Oct-4-interacting protein is the murine orthologue of human WWP2 and is designated Wwp2. Furthermore, there are sequences similar to Wwp2 in a number of other organisms including rat, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Analysis of the deduced protein from the Wwp2-homologous sequences and domain structures from different species indicates that Wwp2 is an evolutionally conserved protein (Fig. 1C). Wwp2 Is a Ubiquitously Expressed Protein with High Expression in Undifferentiated ES Cells—Northern blot analysis of RNA from various mouse tissues identified two Wwp2 mRNA transcripts with approximate lengths of 3.0 and 4.4 kb, respectively, with the former being the predominant form (Fig. 2A). Among the tissues examined, the mRNA expression level was highest in testis, relatively high in spleen, kidney, and liver, and low in brain, heart, and lung but absent in skeletal muscle. To examine the intracellular distribution of endogenous Wwp2, immunofluorescent staining of SS1 mouse ES cells was performed with Wwp2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, Wwp2 protein was present both in the nuclei and cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 2B, a-c). In control, Wwp2 protein was not detected in rabbit control IgG-stained cells (Fig. 2B, d-f). The same results were also obtained when CGR8 and D3 ES cells were stained (data not shown). The results demonstrate that Wwp2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein and exists in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in ES cells. To examine whether expression of Wwp2 in ES cell is related to the differentiation status of the cells, CGR8 ES cells were treated with 0.1 μm retinoic acid and the protein levels of Wwp2 and Oct-4 were determined by Western blot. Apparently, protein levels of both Wwp2 and Oct-4 were decreased when the cells were induced into differentiation (Fig. 2, C and D). The decrease pattern of Wwp2 was paralleled with that of Oct-4, although the decrease in Oct-4 protein level (<4% left by day 4) was more dramatic than in Wwp2 (∼36% left by day 4). The observation suggests that Wwp2 might be involved in the maintenance of Oct-4 activity within a normal range in ES cells. Wwp2 Associates with Oct-4 in Vitro and in Vivo—To confirm the association between Oct-4 and Wwp2 detected by affinity purification, GST pull-down assay was performed with bacterially expressed GST fusion protein of Wwp2 and His fusion protein of Oct-4. As shown in Fig. 3A, immobilized GST-Wwp2, but not GST alone, was able to pull down His-Oct-4. This indicates that Wwp2 interacts with Oct-4 directly in vitro. We next determined whether Wwp2 associated with Oct-4 in vivo. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using lysates of HEK 293 cells expressing exogenous Oct-4 and FLAG-tagged Wwp2 or vector alone. As shown in Fig. 3B, Oct-4 coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Wwp2. As a control, Oct-4 was not detected in the immunoprecipitates of cells expressing FLAG-Wwp2 or Oct-4 alone, providing evidence for the specific interaction of these two proteins in mammalian cells. Lastly, we examined whether the interaction between endogenous Oct-4 and Wwp2 occurred (Fig. 3C). Anti-Oct-4 antibody, but not the Rabbit IgG control, was able to coimmunoprecipitate Wwp2 from nuclear extracts of F9 cells, demonstrating the existence of endogenous Oct-4-Wwp2 complexes in embryonic pluripotent cells. Therefore, we conclude that there is a specific interaction between Oct-4 and Wwp2 both in vitro and in vivo. Mapping of Wwp2-interacting Domains—To determine which domains of Wwp2 interact with Oct-4, C2, WW (including all four WW domains), and HECT domains of Wwp2 were expressed as GST fusion proteins. Also, a Wwp2 full-length fusion protein and one with a mutation of residue 838 cysteine to alanine (Wwp2-CA) were used. The expression of these GST fusion proteins is shown in Fig. 4A, bottom panel. As shown in Fig. 4A, top panel, in addition to full-length Wwp2, WW domains bound to Oct-4 were detected by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody. Furthermore, the mutation of cysteine to alanine in the HECT domain of residue 838 did not affect its association with Oct-4. In contrast, C2 and HECT domains were not capable of binding to Oct-4. Therefore, the interaction with Oct-4 is probably mediated through the WW domains of Wwp2. Mapping of Oct-4-interacting Domains—The amino-terminal region of Oct-4 is rich in proline and acidic residues, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region is rich in proline, serine, and threonine. To determine the regions of Oct-4 involved in the interaction with Wwp2, full-length Oct-4, amino-terminal region (N-96, residual 29-124), and carboxyl-terminal region (C-70, residue 283-352) were expressed bacterially as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). GST pull-down assays with His-Wwp2 were performed. As shown in Fig. 4B, top panel, in addition to full-length Oct-4, both amino and carboxyl termini of Oct-4 interacted with Wwp2 directly, even when washed in 500 mm of salt condition. As a negative control, GST fusion with amino-terminal 118 amino acids of Rex-1 (GSTRex1N) could not pull down His-Wwp2 and GST alone could not either. This result indicates that both the amino-terminal region and carboxyl-terminal region of Oct-4 could interact with Wwp2. Wwp2 Promotes Oct-4 Ubiquitination—The presence of HECT domain in the carboxyl terminus of Wwp2 suggests that it might be an E3 Ub-protein ligase. To determine whether Wwp2 has an intrinsic E3 activity and whether Oct-4 is indeed a substrate for Wwp2, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 5A, left panel, higher molecular weight species indicative of the addition of Ub moieties to Oct-4 were only seen in the presence of added E1, E2, Ub, and Wwp2 (lane 5) and were Oct-4-dependent (not in lane 6). A cysteine residue in the HECT domains of E3 ligases of this family is thought to play a crucial role for ubiquitin thioester bond formation and for the ability of E3 to target protein substrates for ubiquitination (18Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 32Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To examine a possible role of the Wwp2 HECT domain in mediating Oct-4 ubiquitination, the mutant form of Wwp2 (Wwp2-CA) was tested. As expected, Wwp2-CA could not ubiquitinate Oct-4 (lane 7), which provides strong evidence for the importance of cysteine at residue 838 in this enzymatic reaction. To further confirm that the ubiquitinated protein is indeed Oct-4, Western blotting was performed with anti-Oct-4 antibody. Again, a higher molecular weight smear was only detected in the presence of E1, E2, Ub, Oct-4, and Wwp2 (lane 5 in Fig. 5A, right panel). These observations confirm that Oct-4 can serve as a substrate for Wwp2-dependent ubiquitination in vitro. We next tested whether Wwp2 can mediate Oct-4 ubiquitination in vivo. To detect ubiquitinated forms of cellular Oct-4, HEK 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding His-tagged Ub, Oct-4, and Wwp2. Ubiquitinated proteins in the cell lysate were isolated by nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Oct-4 antibody (Fig. 5B, top panel). Coexpression of His-tagged Ub with Oct-4 caused ubiquitination of exogenously expressed Oct-4 in the higher molecular weight form (lane 3). This could be the result of endogenous human WWP2 or other E3 activities present in the cells (the full-length of human WWP2 was cloned from HEK 293 cDNA, data not shown). Surprisingly, the ubiquitinated Oct-4 was reduced instead of being increased when Wwp2 was coexpressed (lane 4). Western blot analysis showed that Oct-4 protein level was significantly reduced in the presence of exogenous Wwp2 (lane 4, middle panel), which suggests that the reduction in the ubiquitinated Oct-4 might be caused by Wwp2-mediated Oct-4 degradation. To verify this hypothesis, the cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor (MG132) before harvest. Strikingly, ubiquitination of Oct-4 was significantly enhanced by the treatment with MG132 (compare lane 4 with lane 5). Meanwhile, the Oct-4 protein level was recovered to a level close to the control. These data reveal that Wwp2 promotes both Oct-4 ubiquitination and degradation in vivo. In contrast, Wwp2-CA did not affect Oct-4 ubiquitination significantly, either in the presence or absence of MG132 (lanes 6 and 7). Moreover, the Oct-4 protein level was not reduced by overexpression of Wwp2-CA (lane 6, middle panel), further confirming the specific effect of Wwp2 E3 ligase activity on Oct-4 ubiquitination and steady-state protein level. In contrast, there was no detectable ubiquitination when Wwp2 and His-tagged Ub were coexpressed in the cells (Fig. 5B, top panel, lane 2), suggesting that the ubiquitination"

In mesangial cells that regulate glomerular fibrosis in vivo, BMP7 inhibits transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-driven fibrogenesis, primarily by preventing the TGF-β-dependent down-regulation of matrix degradation and up-regulation of PAI-1. The signals and mechanisms of the BMP7 opposition to actions of TGF-β are unknown. Here we show in mesangial cells that BMP7 reduces nuclear accumulation of Smad3 and blocks the transcriptional up-regulation of the TGF-β/Smad3 target, CAGA-lux. Smad5 knock-down impairs the ability of BMP7 to interfere with the activation of CAGA-lux and the accumulation of PAI-1 by TGF-β indicating that Smad5 is required. Smad5 knock-down also reduces the rise in Smad6 upon BMP7. Forced expression of smad5 (found to be the preferred BMP7-induced receptor-activated Smad signal in mesangial cells) or of smad6 mimics BMP7 in opposing the increase in transcriptional activation of PAI-1 and its secretion upon TGF-β. This suggests a model for the BMP7-induced opposition to TGF-β-dependent mesangial fibrogenesis requiring Smad5; the model involves the inhibitory Smad6 downstream of Smad5 as well as reduced availability of Smad3 in the nucleus. BMP7 does not require signaling through Erk1/2, p38, or JNK and does not utilize the TGF-β transcriptional co-repressors Ski or SnoN in mesangial cells.

Its physiologic functions in the adult kidney are unknown presently. Observations from this and other laboratories recently have shown that renal BMP7 expression declines progressively in early experimental diabetic or obstructive nephropathy, predating the histological onset and progression of glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (5Wang S.

Although renal glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrogenesis share some of their regulatory mechanisms, they are two different processes, do not necessarily occur simultaneously, and involve different cell types. Renal fibrosis is the mutual, terminal fate of many chronic renal diseases and causes kidney failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. In experimental rodent models of obstructive or diabetic nephropathy, exogenously administered rhBMP7 reduces glomerular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and preserves renal function (7Morrissey J. Hruska K. Guo G. Wang S. Chen Q. Klahr S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: S14-S21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wang S. Chen Q. Simon T.C. Strebeck F. Chaudhary L. Morrissey J. Liapis H. Klahr S. Hruska K.A. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 2037-2049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Remarkably, therapy with rhBMP7 even can resolve early, established glomerular and interstitial fibrosis in rats with diabetic nephropathy (8Wang S. Chen Q. Simon T.C. Strebeck F. Chaudhary L. Morrissey J. Liapis H. Klahr S. Hruska K.A. Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 2037-2049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because fibrogenesis in both of these experimental diseases is heavily TGF-β-dependent, we hypothesized that BMP7 may antagonize TGF-β-induced fibrogenic events. Indeed, in cultured mesangial cells that were incubated with TGF-β, coincubation with BMP7 reduced accumulation of collagen and fibronectin. Some of these effects of BMP7 apparently result from inhibition of the TGF-β effects on fibrosis mediators and matrix protein degrading enzymes (MMP2) as well as their regulators (such as PAI-1) (9Wang S. Hirschberg R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F1006-F1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, BMP7 may induce signals that interfere with the actions of TGF-β. In some cell types TGF-β and BMPs may utilize non-Smad signal pathways involving ERK, p38MAPK, or JNK-c-Jun (5Wang S. LaPage J. Hirschberg R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2392-2399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lai C.F. Cheng S.L. J. Biol.

However, Smad2 and especially Smad3 are thought to be the primary TGF-β-induced fibrogenesis signals in most cells, and renal fibrogenesis may require Smad3 (11Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J.

Activation of TGF-β-receptors by their ligand causes the phosphorylation and activation of Smad substrates, Smad2 and -3, their heterodimerization with Smad4, translocation into the nucleus, and interaction with other regulatory proteins and specific gene targets (14Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). As a group, BMPs can utilize another series of receptor-activated (R-)Smads, namely Smad1 and Smad5 (15Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Smad6 and -7 are inhibitory Smads that interfere with the phosphorylation of R-Smads and with their association with Smad4 (16Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Smad6 is induced by BMPs and inhibits TGF-β and BMP signaling. Smad7 is induced by TGF-β and inhibits TGF-β signals in a negative feedback manner (17Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 18Kleeff J. Maruyama H. Friess H. Büchler M.W. Falb D. Korc M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Dev. 2000; 93: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In TGF-β as well as BMP7 signaling, Smad4 acts as a transcriptional co-activator together with Smad2 and -3 or Smad1 and -5, respectively. TGF-β-dependent transcriptional activation of gene targets by Smad2 and -3 is modified further by other proteins, which include the co-repressors Ski and SnoN. SnoN appears to be a selective inhibitor of Smad3-dependent transcription. Both Ski and SnoN bind to Smad3 and may not interfere with nuclear translocation but rather prevent Smad3-induced transcriptional activation at target Smad binding element sites through the recruitment of histone deacetylase (20Wotton D. Massagué J. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar, 21Xu W. Angelis K. Danielpour D. Haddad M.M. Bischof O. Campisi J. Stavnezer E. Medrano E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although there is evidence that BMP7 opposes TGF-β in kidney and in cultured mesangial cells, there is little known about mediating mechanisms. Here we examine which BMP7 signals contribute to antagonizing fibrogenic effects of TGF-β in mesangial cells as a model to understand how BMP7 opposes glomerular fibrogenesis. Cell Culture Models—Experiments were performed in murine mesangial cells, which were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (3:1) containing 14 mm HEPES and 5% fetal bovine serum (23MacKay K. Striker L.J. Elliot S. Pinkert C.A. Brinster R.L. Striker G.E. Kidney Int. 1988; 33: 677-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Prior to each experiment cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h. Some experiments were performed in mink lung epithelial cells (MLECs) stably expressing a PAI-1 promoter/lux construct (24Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). These cells were provided by Dan Rifkin, New York University, New York, NY. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and G418 supplement. Phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38, and JNK was examined in mesangial cells in 6-well plates that were incubated without (control) or with rhBMP7 (a kind gift from John McCartney, Curis, Cambridge, MA), rhTGF-β1 (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), or both combined each at 1 nm for 0.5-4 h. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Aliquots of cleared lysates were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and membranes underwent Western analysis with anti-phospho-Erk1/2 or anti-total Erk1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In other aliquots, Western blot analysis was performed with monoclonal anti-phospho-p38 and anti-total p38, or anti-phospho-JNK, or -total JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence and captured on x-ray film. R-Smad Phosphorylation by BMP7 in Mesangial Cells—Depending on cell type and context, both Smad1 and -5 have been implicated as major BMP-activated R-Smads. To examine which, if any, of these Smads is preferred by BMP7 in mesangial cells, serum-deprived, confluent cells in 10-cm plates underwent phosphate depletion and then were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free medium (ICN-Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA). BMP7, 1 nm, was added then for 30 min, and cells were washed and taken up in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were briefly sonicated (3 s, 4 watts) and cleared by centrifugation. Smad1 was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg/ml anti-Smad1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h at 4 °C. Then, 25 μl of protein G-agarose suspension was added, and samples were incubated on a rocking platform overnight. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and taken up in 1× reducing Laemmli buffer. Smad5 was immunoprecipitated similarly using specific Smad5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). None of the antibodies cross-reacted with other Smads. Proteins in the immunoprecipitates were electrophoretically separated, and dried SDS-polyacrylamide gels were autoradiographed. Control blots were performed for Smad1 and Smad5 in lysates from similarly treated, unlabeled cells. Smad5 was visualized directly by Western blot analysis. For visualization of Smad1, immunoprecipitation was required prior to immunoblotting. Nuclear Translocation of Smad3 and Smad5 upon Incubation with rhBMP7 and/or rhTGF-β—Mesangial cells that were grown to about 40% confluence in 6-well plates were co-transfected with pcDNA3-6xmyc-Smad5 and pcDNA3-flag-smad3 (kindly provided by Aris Moustakas and Serhiy Souchelnytskyi of Uppsala, Sweden). Cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of plasmid DNA at a ratio of 1:12.5 with Effectene reagent (Qiagen) using the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency as assessed by immunocytochemistry was ∼25-30%. Cells then were incubated with rhBMP7 (200 pm), rhTGF-β1 (200 pm), or both combined for 2 h. Cells were washed once with PBS containing phosphatase inhibitors, and separated cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were obtained using the Nuclear Extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) and the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, to each well was added 480 μl of PBS/phosphatase inhibitors. Cells from two wells of 6-well plates were scraped carefully, combined into one sample, and then pelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of 1× hypotonic buffer and incubated on ice for 15 min. After the addition of 3 μl of detergent per tube followed by vortexing, nuclei were recovered by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the cytoplasmic protein fraction was stored on ice. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with PBS and lysed in 30 μl of 1× reducing Laemmli buffer. Total protein in cytoplasmic lysates was measured with the RC DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Ten μg of cytoplasmic or nuclear protein extracts per lane underwent electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Smad3 and Smad5 were visualized by undergoing Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) and monoclonal anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Subsequently, membranes were washed with deionized water, stripped with 200 mm NaOH, washed again, and blotted with monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ) and anti-histone H4 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for loading control. Quantitative assessments were made after densitometry using nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios. Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Levels of Ski and SnoN upon Incubation with rhBMP7 and rhTGF-β—Mesangial cells were incubated with rhBMP7 (200 pm), rhTGF-β1 (200 pm) or both for 2 h, and cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. Aliquots underwent electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Ski and SnoN were visualized by Western blot with anti-Ski and anti-SnoN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. Stripped membranes were reblotted with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and anti-histone H4 for loading control. Expression of Inhibiting Smad6 and Smad7 upon BMP7 and TGF-β in Mesangial Cells—Cells were incubated with serum-free medium containing rhBMP7 or rhTGF-β (200 pm) for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted with the RNA-Stat60 reagent and the manufacturer's recommended method (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Smad6 and -7 mRNA levels were measured by reverse transcriptase PCR using specific primers for Smad6 (sense: 5′-CTG AGA GTG ACT GCG AGA CG-3′; antisense: 5′-CTT GAG CAG CGA GTA CGT GA-3′) and Smad 7 (sense: 5′-GAA GTC AAG AGG CTG TGT TGC-3′; antisense: 5′-CAG GCT CCA GAA GAA GTT GG-3′) with co-amplification of 18 S rRNA as the internal standard in each tube. PCR products were separated in agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Results were expressed as ratios of densitometric units of mRNA/18 S rRNA. Effect of Overexpressing Smad5 or Smad6 on TGF-β-induced PAI-1 Promoter Activation—Induction of PAI-1 is one of the mechanisms by which TGF-β contributes to fibrosis, i.e. the accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins. TGF-β raises PAI-1 levels by transcriptional activation, and this was used as an experimental model to test whether BMP7-dependent Smad5 or Smad6 contributes to the opposition to TGF-β. MLECs stably expressing the PAI-1/lux reporter construct were co-transfected with empty pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-smad5 expression vector or pcDNA3-smad6 (provided by Kohei Miyazono, Tokyo, Japan). Transfections were performed in 60-mm dishes with Effectene reagent and 1.0 μg of plasmid DNA at a ratio of 12.5:1. Transfection efficiency was 25-30% as established by the immunofluorescence staining of cells. Transfected cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Upon attachment, cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 24 h and then with control medium or medium containing TGF-β at 50, 100, or 200 pm. Cells were incubated for 12 h, washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed in 1× lysate buffer, and frozen at -80 °C for at least 2 h. Luciferase activity was measured in cleared lysates with luciferase reagent (Promega) in a luminometer (Zylux Corporation Berthold Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). PAI-1 protein levels also were examined in mesangial cell media during incubation with TGF-β and forced expression of smad5 or smad6. Mesangial cells in 6-well plates were transiently transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector or the above smad5 or smad6 expression plasmids. Cells then were incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of TGF-β (200 pm for 48 h). Media were cleared by centrifugation. Heparin-binding proteins were precipitated from cleared media with 25 μl/ml of a 1:1 slurry of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with PBS, extracted in reducing Laemmli buffer, and heated at 85 °C for 10 min. Proteins were electrophoretically separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Blocked membranes were immunoblotted with anti-PAI-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Requirement of Smad5 for BMP7 to Inhibit TGF-β-induced, Smad3-dependent Transcriptional Activation in Mesangial Cells—CAGA boxes are Smad3/Smad4-specific, TGF-β-responsive transcription-activating elements in several genes including PAI-1 (25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). We used a 9×CAGA-lux construct, which is up-regulated in a Smad3-dependent manner by TGF-β to examine whether BMP7 interferes with Smad3-mediated transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we tested whether Smad5 is required by BMP7 to reduce this TGF-β effect using a Smad5 knock-down approach. We designed and tested four different Smad5 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Transfection of each of these Smad5 siRNAs into mesangial cells reduces Smad5 levels, but siRNA 1 is most effective (Fig. 1) and was used in the main experiments. Smad5 siRNA duplexes were constructed using the Silencer siRNA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, two 29-mer DNA oligonucleotide templates were synthesized containing a 21-nucleotide smad5-specific sequence and the 8-nucleotide leader sequence 5′-CCT GTC TC-3′, which is complementary to the T7 promoter primer. The antisense strand of the Smad5 siRNA template 1 is 5′-AAG GCA GTG GAT GCT TTA GTG CCT GTC TC-3′, and the sense template sequence is 5′-AAC ACT AAA GCA TCC ACT GCC CCT GTC TC-3′. Templates for a nonsilencing siRNA were used to generate a negative control with the same nucleotide content but without sequence homology in the GenBank™ data base (antisense template, 5′-AAA GGC GTT GAT TTC GGT GAC CCT GTC TC-3′; sense template, 5′-AAC TCA CCG AAA TCA ACG CCT CCT GTC TC-3′). siRNA templates were hybridized to a T7 promoter primer, and the 3′-ends were extended by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase to create double-stranded transcription templates. Strands were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase, and the resulting transcripts were hybridized to each other. The leader sequences were removed with single strand-specific ribonuclease. Mesangial cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h cells were transfected with pGL3-9×CAGA-lux (kindly provided by Kohei Miyazono, Tokyo, Japan), 0.4 μg of plasmid DNA/well, and Effectene reagent at a ratio of 1:12.5. After 8 h cells were washed and co-transfected with Smad5 siRNA or non-silencing, control siRNA at a final concentration of 25 nm using siPORT amine reagent (Ambion). After 16 h cells were transferred into 96-well plates, allowed to attach for 8 h, incubated with serum-free medium for 24 h, and then incubated with TGF-β1 (0, 12.5, 50, or 200 pm) in the presence or absence of BMP7 (1000 pm) for 16 h. Cells were washed and luciferase activity was measured luminometrically in cell lysates. The dependence of BMP7 to interfere with the TGF-β-driven upregulation of PAI-1 was examined in separate experiments. Mesangial cells were transfected with scrambled, non-silencing Smad5 siRNA or silencing Smad5 siRNA and then were incubated with TGF-β in the absence or presence of BMP7 (1 nm each) for 48 h. Accumulation of PAI-1 in cleared, conditioned medium was examined by Western blot analysis of heparin-affinity-precipitated proteins. To elucidate whether Smad5 knock-down also blocks the increase in Smad6 upon BMP7, mesangial cells were transfected with non-silencing, scrambled, control siRNA or with Smad5 siRNA as described above. Cells then were incubated with or without rhBMP7 (1000 pm) for 24 h. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors, aliquots were electrophoretically separated, and transferred proteins underwent Western blot analysis to visualize Smad5 and Smad6, respectively. Stripped membranes were reblotted with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for loading control. Smad6 bands were quantified as the ratio over glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase densitometric units and expressed in % of controls that were transfected with non-silencing RNA and not exposed to BMP7. Statistical evaluations of quantitative data were made by analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls multicomparison test. Probabilities of p < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. BMP7 and TGF-β Do Not Activate Erk1/2, p38, or JNK in Mesangial Cells—To elucidate whether BMP7 and TGF-β, perhaps differentially, activate the Erk1/2, p38, or JNK pathways, phosphorylation of these signal kinases upon TGF-β and BMP7 was examined by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. In mesangial cells neither TGF-β nor BMP7 phosphorylate Erk1/2 efficiently compared with baseline control (Fig. 2). Similarly, TGF-β, BMP7, or both in combination (each at 200 pm) do not change the phosphorylation state of p38 or JNK in mesangial cells (Fig. 2). Thus, modifications of ERK, p38, or JNK activity are unlikely signal avenues for BMP7 in mesangial cells. BMP7 Utilizes Preferably Smad5 as R-Smad Substrate in Mesangial Cells—Mesangial cells expressed both BMP-sensitive R-Smads, Smad1, and Smad5 as tested by reverse transcriptase PCR (data not shown). Experiments were performed to examine whether Smad1, Smad5, or both are phosphorylated efficiently by BMP7 in mesangial cells. Incubation of metabolically 32P-labeled cells with BMP7 causes efficient phosphorylation of Smad5 but not or only minimal phosphorylation of Smad1 (Fig. 3). This suggests that Smad5 is the preferred R-Smad for BMP7 in mesangial cells. BMP7 and Smad5 Affect Nuclear Levels of Smad3—Both TGF-β- and BMP-activated R-Smads form dimers with Smad4; heterodimerization with Smad4 facilitates nuclear import and interaction with gene targets in collaboration with other transcriptional modulators (26Massagué J. Blain S. Lo R. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2092) Google Scholar). Even in serum-starved, unstimulated mesangial cells that were co-transfected with smad3 and smad5, some amount of these R-Smads resides in the nucleus (Fig. 4). However, upon incubation with TGF-β, there occurs a Smad3 shift from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, and the ratio of nuclear/cytoplasmic Smad3 increases (Fig. 4, top bar graph). Addition of equimolar BMP7 to TGF-β-exposed cells partially blocks the nuclear accumulation of Smad3 as indicated by a reduced nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (Fig. 4, top bar graph). BMP7 increases the ratio of nuclear/cytoplasmic Smad5 more than 2-fold compared with control (Fig. 4, bottom bar graph). TGF-β alone does not significantly change the distribution of Smad5 between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. However, TGF-β reduces the BMP7-induced nuclear translocation of Smad5, and the ratio of nuclear/cytoplasmic Smad5 in the presence of both TGF-β and BMP7 is not different from control (Fig. 4, bottom bar graph). BMP7 Does Not Affect Levels and Nuclear Distribution of TGF-β Transcriptional Co-repressors Ski and SnoN—Incubation of mesangial cells with TGF-β may modestly increase total levels of Ski but clearly causes Ski to translocate from cytoplasm into the nucleus (Fig. 5). Incubation of cells with TGF-β and BMP7 or with BMP7 alone does not modify the levels or nuclear accumulation of Ski. In contrast to Ski, TGF-β does not change substantially the total levels or nuclear accumulation of SnoN in mesangial cells. BMP7 itself also does not affect levels or distribution of SnoN. These results suggest that BMP7 does not (up-)regulate levels or nuclear distribution of the TGF-β transcriptional co-repressors Ski or SnoN, i.e. BMP7 does not use this avenue to inhibit TGF-β effects. TGF-β and BMP7 Differentially Regulate Smad6 Expression—Similar to its effects in other cell types, BMP7 (200 pm) substantially increases expression of Smad6 in mesangial cells. In contrast, isomolar TGF-β reduces Smad6 mRNA levels significantly by about 50% below base line (Fig. 6). As expected, TGF-β increases Smad7 mRNA levels, but BMP7 has no effect on the expression of this latter inhibiting Smad (Fig. 6). Thus, Smad6 expression is differentially regulated by BMP7 and TGF-β and may be a BMP7 signal that antagonizes the fibrogenic effects of TGF-β. Smad5 and Smad6 Raise the Resistance to TGF-β-dependent Activation of the PAI-1 Promoter—MLECs stably expressing the PAI-1/lux construct were used as a model to examine whether Smad5 or Smad6 reduces TGF-β effects on the transcriptional activation of PAI-1. As shown in Fig. 7, forced expression of smad5 substantially increases the resistance to TGF-β to increase PAI-1 promoter-driven luciferase activity. Similarly, overexpression of smad6 also reduces the ability of TGF-β to activate the PAI-1 promoter efficiently (Fig. 7). This phenomenon also can be demonstrated in mesangial cells. In control cells that are transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector, TGF-β (200 pm) increases secreted PAI-1 protein levels (Fig. 8). Overexpression of smad5 or smad6 each reduces the amount of PAI-1 that accumulates in the media upon the addition of TGF-β. BMP7 Requires Smad5 for Efficient Inhibition of TGF-β-dependent, Smad3-mediated Transcriptional Activation—Transcriptional activation of the 9×CAGA-lux construct by TGF-β is Smad3-dependent (25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). In mesangial cells that express 9×CAGA-lux, luciferase activity is increased by TGF-β in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 9a). However, co-incubation with BMP7 inhibits this effect of TGF-β (Fig. 9a, top panel). Beca"

We have identified and exploited the novel substrate specificity of the coliphage K5 lyase in studies of the domain organization of HS. We show that K5 lyase cleaves HS principally within non-sulfated sequences of four or more N-acetylated disaccharides. Uniquely, sections comprising alternating N-acetylated and N-sulfated units are resistant to the enzyme, as are the highly sulfated S domains. Spacing of the K5 lyase cleavage sites (∼7–8 kDa) is similar to that of the S domains. On the basis of these findings, we propose a refined model of the structure of HS in which N-acetylated sequences of four to five disaccharide units (GlcNAc-GlcUA)4–5 are positioned centrally between the S domains. The latter are embedded within N-acetylated and N-sulfated sequences, forming extended regions of hypervariable sulfation distributed at regular intervals along the polymer chain.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar); the initial product of chain polymerization is the polysaccharide precursor heparan, made up of repeating disaccharide units of α1,4-linked GlcNAc and β1,4-linked glucuronic acid (GlcUA). Subsequent modifications result in the formation of clusters of sulfated residues at intervals along the chain. These are the so-called S domains, separated by intervening regions of intermediate or low sulfation that include unmodified disaccharides (11Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The initial step in the transition from heparan to HS is catalyzed by N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase enzymes, which typically convert 40–50% of the GlcNAc residues to N-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS). Subsequently, Glc-UAs adjacent to these GlcNS units are frequently epimerized to form iduronate (IdoUA). The resulting GlcNS/IdoUA-rich domains are then the primary substrates for the O-sulfotransferases that can add sulfate groups to C-2 of IdoUA and C-6 and C-3 of GlcNSO3. Not all potential monosaccharide substrates become O-sulfated, and this leads to considerable variation in sulfation patterns within the S domains. Additionally, alternating sequences made up of GlcNS- and GlcNAc-containing disaccharides (NA/NS domains) are also found in the HS chain (12Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Lyon M. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and 6-O-sulfate groups frequently occur within these regions including GlcNAc (17Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A significant proportion of the heparan chain fails to be modified in any way, and thus extended sequences of GlcNAc-GlcUA disaccharides (NAc domains) still exist in the mature HS. To date, most of the proteins for which an HS-binding sequence has been identified interact with the heterogeneous S domains. Given the unmodified nature of the NAc domains, it is thought that this type of sequence has little or no interaction with protein ligands and merely acts to space the S domains correctly. Little is known about the relative positioning of the NA/NS domains within the polymer chain or the role they play in ligand binding, although they are thought to occur primarily at the borders between S domains and NAc domains, i.e. forming transition zones between the two. In some notable instances, e.g. antithrombin III (13Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the interactions between protein and the S domains are dependent on a critical sequence of sugars carrying essential sulfate modifications. For some proteins, the saccharide requirements for ligand binding are less well defined, although the length and the general composition of the binding sequences have been characterized, i.e. a preference for C-6 sulfation over C-2 or N-sulfation, in the case of both hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (18Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and vascular endothelial growth factor (19Ono K. Hattori H. Takeshita S. Kurita A. Ishihara M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently, the C-terminal endostatin fragment of collagen XVIII has been proposed to bind to S domains interrupted by one GlcNAc residue (20Kreuger J. Matsumoto T. Vanwildemeersch M. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Claesson-Welsh L. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6303-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and with specific requirements for sulfation at C-6 of amino sugars (21Blackhall F.H. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Jayson G.C. Folkman J. Javaherian K. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 131-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a third family of HS-binding proteins, the region of HS found to interact with the ligand is more extended, encompassing typically two S domains, including the intervening regions of lower sulfation. This kind of interaction is a particular characteristic of the multimeric cytokines, e.g. platelet factor-4 (22Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20508-20514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), interleukin-8 (23Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15487-15493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and interferon-γ (24Lortat-Jacob H. Turnbull J.E. Grimaud J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Experimentally, protein-interacting sequences in HS are typically excised by either chemical (low pH nitrous acid, hydrazine) or enzymatic (heparinase) depolymerization, followed by size- or charge-based separation of the resulting fragments. These are then analyzed for their composition, sequence, and biological function. In common with many other areas of biopolymer analysis, the available degradative techniques and separation tools limit the level of interpretation that can be achieved. At present, there are three commercially available heparinases that degrade HS. These lyase enzymes are produced naturally by the soil bacterium Flavobacterium heparinum, and their actions on HS have been well characterized (25Desai U.R. Wang H.M. Linhardt R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 26Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 27Lohse D.L. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparinase I has a specificity for cleaving within di- or trisulfated disaccharides of the type GlcNS(±6S)-IdoUA(2S). Thus, this enzyme will cleave exclusively within the S domains of HS. Heparinase III has a strong preference for linkages to GlcUA within units of the type GlcNS/NAc-GlcUA. Hence, this enzyme cleaves exclusively outside the S domains, digesting both the NAc domains and NA/NS regions. Heparinase II is the least discriminating of the three lyases and will cleave within a relatively wide range of sequences. The substrate specificities of these enzymes have facilitated many investigations concerning the structure of S domains and their distribution within the polymer chain, but they cannot provide information on the location of the NA/NS regions and their proximity to the S domains. This is an important question in relation to structure-function studies of HS, because these regions contain a significant proportion of N- and 6-O-sulfate groups (11Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The sulfation pattern, and potential information content of the NA/NS sequences, will therefore be distinct from the S domains. The K5 capsular polysaccharide of the K5 strain of Escherichia coli is a polymer composed of alternating β1,4-linked GlcUA and α1,4-linked GlcNAc residues (28Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This sequence is identical to heparan, the polymeric precursor of HS, and thus to the unmodified NAc domains of mature HS. It has been known for some time that there are two lyase enzymes that can degrade the K5 polysaccharide chain into smaller oligosaccharides by a β-elimination mechanism. One is an E. coli enzyme referred to as ElmA (29Legoux R. Lelong P. Jourde C. Feuillerat C. Capdevielle J. Sure V. Ferran E. Kaghad M. Delpech B. Shire D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Salome M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7260-7264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second is associated with the tail structure of the bacteriophage K5A (30Gupta D. Jann B. Jann K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1982; 16: 13-17Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This bacteriophage specifically infects E. coli K5, using the lyase to degrade the K5 polysaccharide capsule, thus allowing it access to masked receptors on the bacterial cell surface. Recently, the cloning, expression, and purification of a recombinant form of this bacteriophage lyase (KflA; K5 lyase) was reported (31Clarke B.R. Esumeh F. Roberts I.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3761-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here we describe the unique substrate specificity of recombinant K5 lyase and its limited cleavage of HS. Analysis of the products of K5 lyase degradation has enabled us to make significant refinements to the current model of the domain structure of HS. Bio-Gel P-10 (fine grade) was purchased from Bio-Rad. Sepharose CL-6B and PD-10 prepacked, disposable Sephadex G-25 columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. ProPac PA-1 analytical strong anion-exchange HPLC columns were from Dionex (Camberley, Surrey, UK). Heparinase I (F. heparinum, EC 4.2.2.7), heparinase II (F. heparinum, no EC number assigned), and heparinase III (F. heparinum, EC 4.2.2.8) were purchased from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK). K5 lyase was purified as described previously (31Clarke B.R. Esumeh F. Roberts I.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3761-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris, EC 4.2.2.4), heparin, hyaluronan, and DEAE-Sephacel were all purchased from Sigma. d-[6-3H]Glucosamine hydrochloride (20–45 Ci mmol-1) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell culture media and donor calf serum were from Invitrogen. K5 polysaccharide was supplied by Glycores (Milan, Italy). All HPLC and gel filtration solutions were prepared using MilliQ (Millipore; Watford, UK) ultrapure water. Preparation of Intact HS Chains—Maintenance, radiolabeling, and extraction of HS chains from cultures of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were carried out as described previously (32Merry C.L. Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18455-18462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, the culture medium from cells radiolabeled with [3H]glucosamine was digested with Pronase, and glycosaminoglycans were recovered on DEAE-Sephacel. Contaminating galactosaminoglycans were removed by digestion with chondroitinase ABC. Subsequent Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration yielded intact HS chains. Establishment of the K5 Lyase Incubation Conditions—Cleavage of the K5 polysaccharide by K5 lyase is through a β-elimination mechanism, which generates oligosaccharides terminating with a Δ4,5-unsaturated uronic acid at the non-reducing end (33Hanfling P. Shashkov A.S. Jann B. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4747-4750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enables the extent of degradation to be followed by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 232 nm. With 0.5 mg/ml K5 polysaccharide and 10 μg of enzyme the rate of degradation is initially very rapid, before leveling off and continuing at a much slower rate (data not shown). After 2 h the digestion was complete, because addition of more enzyme resulted in no further increase in the UV absorbance. Specific Enzyme Digestions of HS—Previous studies have indicated that K5 lyase has activity over a broad pH range from 5.5 up to 9 (31Clarke B.R. Esumeh F. Roberts I.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3761-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with an optimum at pH 8.5. Digests were therefore performed in a total volume of 1 ml of 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.5, with 10 μg of enzyme. Heparinase I or III digests of HS were performed in a total volume of 1 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m calcium acetate, pH 7.0, with 2 mIU of enzyme. All enzyme digestions were for 16 h at 37 °C. Digestion products were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography on a Bio-Gel P10 column eluted with 0.25 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 4 ml h -1 or a Sepharose CL6B column (1.5 × 70 cm) eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 12 ml h-1. Strong Anion-exchange HPLC—Large K5 lyase-resistant oligosaccharides, which eluted in the void volume of a Bio-Gel P10 column (1.5 × 170 cm), were further resolved using strong anion-exchange (SAX) HPLC. Samples were applied to a ProPac PA-1 column (4.6 × 250 mm) pre-equilibrated with MilliQ water adjusted to pH 3.5 with HCl. Elution was effected with a biphasic NaCl gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl over 7 min, followed by 0.3–1.1 m NaCl over 120 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and aliquots monitored for radioactivity. Relevant fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted on a PD10 column eluted with water and then evaporated to dryness on a centrifugal evaporator. Disaccharide Analysis—HS samples were completely digested with a combination of heparinases I–III (2 mIU of each) and analyzed for their disaccharide compositions, by SAX-HPLC, as described previously (34Merry C.L. Bullock S.L. Swan D.C. Backen A.C. Lyon M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35429-35434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Preparation of Modified Glycosaminoglycans—Completely desulfated heparin was produced by the sequential de-N-sulfation (35Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Carbohydr. Res. 1974; 36: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), re-N-acetylation, and de-O-sulfation (36Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Kamata T. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 58: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) of heparin. Disaccharide analysis revealed the main disaccharide present to be the unsulfated UA-Glc-NAc (99%), with the remaining trace being UA-GlcNAc(6S). N-Sulfated K5 polysaccharide was kindly supplied by Dr. P. Oreste at Glycores (Milan, Italy). Disaccharide analysis revealed its sole disaccharide component to be UA-GlcNS. Nitrous Acid Scission—Nitrous acid deaminative cleavage of HS was carried out at pH 1.5 using a ratio of nitrous acid to sample of 2:1 (v/v) (37Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by neutralization with 2 m Na2CO3. K5 Lyase Digestion of HS, Comparison with Heparinase I and Heparinase III—HS was digested with either K5 lyase, heparinase I, or heparinase III and fractionated on Sepharose CL-6B (Fig. 1) or Bio-Gel P10 (Fig. 2) to determine the size of the products.Fig. 2Bio-Gel P10 gel filtration profiles of HS before and after cleavage with K5 lyase, heparinase I, or heparinase III. Intact HS (A) and HS after incubation with either K5 lyase (B), heparinase I (C, inset shows the full-scale profile), or heparinase III (D) were chromatographed on a Bio-Gel P10 gel filtration column (1.5 × 170 cm). Fractions were monitored for radioactivity. Vo and Vt values were determined with hyaluronan and sodium dichromate, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Digestion of HS with K5 lyase caused a shift in peak elution position on Sepharose CL-6B from a Kav of 0.36–0.76 (Fig. 1, A and B), corresponding to a change in molecular mass from ∼45 kDa for intact HS to 7.5 kDa for K5 lyase-digested chains (by reference to the calibration curve of Wasteson (38Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar)). Heparinase I-digested chains eluted with a similar size (∼7.5 kDa) (Fig. 1C), whereas the products of a heparinase III digest eluted predominantly in the total volume of the column (i.e. <2.5 kDa) (Fig. 1D). A more detailed comparison of the sizes of the digested fragments can be seen in the Bio-Gel P10 profiles (Fig. 2). Intact HS elutes in the void volume (Fig. 2A). After digestion with K5 lyase (Fig. 2B), a series of small peaks representing oligosaccharides ranging in size from dp2 up to dp20 were resolved, though the majority of the oligosaccharides still eluted in the void volume. A similar profile was produced for heparinase I-degraded HS, although the degree of depolymerization was less than that observed with K5 lyase (Fig. 2C). As expected from previous studies (16Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Merry C.L. Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18455-18462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), digestion by heparinase III was more extensive than by heparinase I. Disaccharides predominated (56%), and almost no material remained in the void volume (Fig. 2D). The splitting of the disaccharide peak is due to almost complete resolution of the disaccharides into mono-sulfated (minor peak) and non-sulfated species (major peak). Disaccharide Compositions of HS Oligosaccharides Generated by K5 Lyase Cleavage—The disaccharide compositions of oligosaccharides that had been generated by K5 lyase digestion, and size-fractionated by Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography (Fig. 1B), were determined. The relative contents of sulfated and non-sulfated disaccharides are compared in Fig. 3. For comparison, the disaccharide composition of the intact parent HS was 54% non-sulfated and 46% sulfated disaccharides. In the K5 lyase-generated fragments, the content of sulfated disaccharides increases rapidly as the oligosaccharide size increases, e.g. from 0% at dp2 to 50% at dp12. Beyond dp14 the increase in sulfated disaccharides is much less pronounced and eventually appears to plateau at around 55%. Glycosaminoglycan-degrading Specificity of K5 Lyase—Substrates were selected to establish whether uronate epimerization, N-sulfation of GlcN residues in the K5 polysaccharide, or the presence of β-hexosaminidic linkages could prevent cleavage by K5 lyase. Heparin that had been completely desulfated and then N-acetylated (thus differing from K5 polysaccharide only by the presence of iduronate), N-sulfated K5 polysaccharide, and hyaluronan were all individually subjected to digestion by K5 lyase under conditions that gave rise to 90% digestion of susceptible linkages in the K5 polysaccharide. The reactions were monitored spectrophotometrically at 232 nm. No digestion occurred with either N-sulfated K5 polysaccharide or hyaluronan. Desulfated/N-acetylated heparin was digested only very slightly, to a level of 3% relative to the K5 polysaccharide (data not shown). Location of N-Sulfated Disaccharides in K5 Lyase-generated HS Oligosaccharides—Information on the positioning of the N-sulfated disaccharides within K5 lyase-generated oligosaccharides of size dp4–10 (see Fig. 2B) was obtained by deaminative cleavage with low pH nitrous acid, followed by Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography (Fig. 4). The sizes of the nitrous acid cleavage products, and their relative proportions, indicates the likely positioning of the N-sulfated units. The dp4 pool was largely resistant to nitrous acid with over 97% of constituent disaccharides identified as being N-acetylated (data not shown). In contrast, the majority of the dp6 pool was cleaved by nitrous acid, yielding dp4 and dp2 products, consistent with an N-sulfate group being present at an internal position (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the majority of the dp8s and dp10s was susceptible to nitrous acid (Fig. 4, B and C), the degradation products being mainly dp4 and dp6 fragments, again indicating the presence of a centrally positioned N-sulfate group. Disaccharide analyses confirmed that most of the dp6–10 fragments only contained a single N-sulfated residue (not shown). Cleavage of K5 Polysaccharide by K5 Lyase—Previous studies (33Hanfling P. Shashkov A.S. Jann B. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4747-4750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on K5 lyase reported that the main degradation products from its action upon K5 polysaccharide were dp6–dp10. However, smaller oligosaccharides were detected when HS was digested with the lyase (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the degradation of K5 polysaccharide was re-examined. Bio-Gel P10 separation of K5 lyase-digested K5 polysaccharide yielded a range of oligosaccharides from dp2 to dp8 (Fig. 5). These sizes were confirmed by re-chromatography of pooled fractions and comparison of their elution positions with those of sized HS oligosaccharides. Fragments of K5 polysaccharide were then prepared by partial degradation with heparinase III and tested for subsequent susceptibility to K5 lyase. As the oligosaccharide length shortened, the efficiency with which they were degraded by K5 lyase decreased dramatically (data not shown). Oligosaccharide sizes of ≥dp10 were degraded into a mixture of fragments ranging from dp2 to dp8, i.e. the same range produced by complete K5 lyase digestion of intact K5 polysaccharide (Fig. 5). Dp8 and dp6 saccharides were only partially degraded leaving 50 and 90%, respectively, of the starting material undigested after a 16-h incubation. The enzyme had negligible activity on tetrasaccharides. These results show that the K5 lyase can degrade contiguous N-acetylated oligosaccharides as small as a dp6, but relatively ineffectively. Its minimal effective substrate is more likely to be sequences containing at least four N-acetylated disaccharides. Structural Analysis of the Large Resistant Fragments Produced by K5 Lyase Digestion of HS—Following degradation of HS with K5 lyase, a significant proportion of material was resistant to the enzyme and remained in the void volume upon Bio-Gel P10 column chromatography (Fig. 2B). Information on the distribution of N-sulfated/N-acetylated disaccharides within these large HS fragments was obtained by subsequent deaminative cleavage with low pH nitrous acid, followed by Bio-Gel P10 chromatography (Fig. 6). Nitrous acid treatment resulted in extensive depolymerization of the large K5 lyase-resistant material to fragments of size dp2–dp8, with the predominant species being tetrasaccharides (Fig. 6B). These findings show that, compared with the nitrous acid profile of the original intact HS (Fig. 6A), the large K5 lyase-resistant sequences are enriched in N-sulfate groups. Most important, the preponderance of tetrasaccharide products (derived from alternating NA/NS disaccharides) demonstrates that the K5 enzyme does not degrade the NA/NS domains. In addition, the absence of species dp ≥10, and the minor content of dp8s, indicates that contiguous sequences of ≥4 N-acetylated units are the major substrates for the K5 lyase enzyme in the HS chain as well as in the K5 polysaccharide. To analyze further the range of HS species resistant to K5 lyase, the resistant fraction (i.e. material in the Vo in Fig. 2B) was resolved on the basis of charge density by using NaCl gradient elution from a SAX-HPLC column (Fig. 7). Because of the highly heterogeneous nature of this enzyme-resistant material, it did not clearly resolve into discrete species. The majority instead eluted as a broad peak spanning the range 0.5–1 m NaCl. This was arbitrarily split into 10 fractions (as shown), and each was analyzed for its disaccharide composition (Table I).Table IDisaccharide compositions of charge-fractionated K5 lyase-resistant HS fragments Each of the 10 pooled fractions from the SAX-HPLC profile in Fig. 7 were analyzed for their disaccharide compositions by SAX-HPLC (see “Methods”).DisaccharidePool numberTotal pool12345678910disaccharide as % total disaccharidesUA-GlcNAc5349464340383535332942UA-GlcNS3436353331302726262333UA-GlcNAc(6S)32224223233UA(2S)-GlcNAc41232441122UA-GlcNS(6S)00012234451UA(2S)-GlcNS711141516151616161413UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S)0123610121518245 Open table in a new tab As might be expected, the percentage of both the non-sulfated (UA-GlcNAc) and the major mono-sulfated (UA-GlcNS) disaccharides gradually fell as the overall charge of the oligosaccharides increased. These units were replaced mainly by the fully sulfated UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S) disaccharide. Most interesting, there were almost no changes in UA-GlcNAc(6S) and UA(2S)-GlcNAc contents across these fragments and only very modest differences in UA-GlcNS(6S) and UA(2S)-GlcNS disaccharides. Information on how the lengths of the S domains alter across the SAX-HPLC profile of the K5 lyase-resistant HS fragments was obtained by digesting selected fractions (Fig. 7, fractions 1, 3, 5, and 7) with heparinase III, followed by Bio-Gel P10 chromatography (Fig. 8, A–D). In fraction 1, 29% of the sequences compose S domains (i.e. fragments dp ≥4 after heparinase III digestion), and these are nearly all dp4 in length (Fig. 8A). As"
https://openalex.org/W2012169363,"The ATM kinase is a tumour suppressor and a key activator of genome integrity checkpoints in mammalian cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) and other insults that elicit DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In response to IR, autophosphorylation on serine 1981 causes dissociation of ATM dimers and initiates cellular ATM kinase activity. Here, we show that the kinetics and magnitude of ATM Ser1981 phosphorylation after exposure of human fibroblasts to low doses (2 Gy) of IR are altered in cells deficient in Nbs1, a substrate of ATM and a component of the MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1) complex involved in processing/repair of DSBs and ATM-dependent cell cycle checkpoints. Timely phosphorylation of both ATM Ser1981 and the ATM substrate Smc1 after IR were rescued via retrovirally mediated reconstitution of Nbs1-deficient cells by wild-type Nbs1 or mutants of Nbs1 defective in the FHA domain or nonphosphorylatable by ATM, but not by Nbs1 lacking the Mre11-interaction domain. Our data indicate that apart from its role downstream of ATM in the DNA damage checkpoint network, the MRN complex serves also as a modulator/amplifier of ATM activity. Although not absolutely required for ATM activation, the MRN nuclease complex may help reach the threshold activity of ATM necessary for optimal genome maintenance and prevention of cancer."

We sought to determine the positional specificity of phosphorylation by yeast CTD kinase-I (CTDK-I), an enzyme implicated in various nuclear processes including elongation and pre-mRNA 3′-end formation. Toward this end, we characterized monoclonal antibodies commonly employed to study CTD phosphorylation patterns and found that the H5 monoclonal antibody reacts with CTD species phosphorylated at Ser2 and/or Ser5. We therefore used antibody-independent methods to study CTDK-I, and we found that CTDK-I phosphorylates Ser5 of the CTD if the CTD substrate is either unphosphorylated or prephosphorylated at Ser2. When Ser5 is already phosphorylated, CTDK-I phosphorylates Ser2 of the CTD. We also observed that CTDK-I efficiently generates doubly phosphorylated CTD repeats; CTD substrates that already contain Ser2-PO4 or Ser5-PO4 are more readily phosphorylated CTDK-I than unphosphorylby ated CTD substrates. The C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II is composed of tandem heptad repeats with consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7. In yeast, this heptad sequence is repeated about 26 times, and it becomes hyperphosphorylated during transcription predominantly at serines 2 and 5.

The C-terminal domain (CTD) 1The abbreviations used are: CTD, C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II large subunit; RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RU, resonance units; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PIC, preinitiation complex; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; P-TEFb, positive transcription elongation factor. of the largest subunit (Rpb1p) of budding yeast RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is composed of about 26 tandem repeats of Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7 (YSPTSPS). Considering that five of seven of these consensus amino acids are potential phosphoacceptors, it is not surprising that this domain is a substrate for phosphorylation. The extent of CTD phosphorylation correlates with the activity of the polymerase: initiating polymerases have unphosphorylated CTDs, whereas CTD hyperphosphorylation is associated with elongation (1Cadena D.L.

Hardin S. Greenleaf A. Lis J.T. Nature. 1994; 370: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation also affects the protein-protein interactions between the CTD and binding partners such as mRNA processing factors (reviewed in Ref. 7Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, phosphorylation occurs predominantly at serines 2 and 5 of the CTD, and Ser2-PO4 and Ser5-PO4 are thought to have separate and essential roles. Substitution of either Ser2 or Ser5 with alanine or glutamate in each repeat is lethal in yeast (8West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and suppressors of Ser2 mutations do not suppress the lethal phenotype of Ser5 mutation (9Yuryev A. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1996; 143: 661-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser5 of the CTD occurs when polymerase is at promoters, whereas Ser2 phosphorylation is observed in coding regions (10Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). CTD-Ser5 phosphorylation is also present in coding regions of yeast genes, although it is detected at lower levels in coding regions than at promoters (11Ahn S.H. Kim M. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In metazoa, as in yeast, the CTD becomes increasingly phosphorylated on Ser2 as RNAPII moves along the transcription unit, and Ser5 phosphorylation has been detected both at promoters and in coding regions (12Boehm A.K. Saunders A. Werner J. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7628-7637Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Cheng C. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1961-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Differential phosphorylation of serine residues of the CTD is thought to identify the stage of transcription and help recruit the appropriate factors for that stage (10Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of Ser5 near promoters is important for capping enzyme recruitment (14McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S.

Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), whereas the 3′-end formation factor, Pcf11p, requires Ser2 phosphorylation for binding (19Licatalosi D.D. Geiger G. Minet M. Schroeder S. Cilli K. McNeil J.B. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). CTD kinases and phosphatases combine to define the CTD phosphorylation pattern and determine the protein-protein interactions involving the transcribing polymerase. Four transcriptionally relevant Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTD kinases have been identified. The Bur1p-Bur2p kinase is essential for viability and promotes transcription elongation (20Murray S. Udupa R. Yao S. Hartzog G. Prelich G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Keogh M.C. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell.

This kinase-cyclin pair co-precipitates with and phosphorylates Rpb1p (20Murray S. Udupa R. Yao S. Hartzog G. Prelich G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4089-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The other essential yeast CTD kinase is Kin28p, whose cyclin is Ccl1p. This kinase associates with the preinitiation complex (PIC) as a part of the TFIIH general transcription factor and phosphorylates the CTD after PIC formation (23Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) but before productive elongation. The Srb10p-Srb11p kinase-cyclin pair (24Liao S.M. Zhang J. Jeffery D.A. Koleske A.J. Thompson C.M. Chao D.M. Viljoen M. van Vuuren H.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) is thought to be a negative regulator of transcription. Mutation of a catalytically important residue or deletion of srb10 restores viability of CTD truncation mutants, and in vitro assays indicate that Srb10p may inhibit transcription by phosphorylating the CTD prior to initiation (23Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). CTDK-I, composed of Ctk1p (catalytic), Ctk2p (cyclin-like), and Ctk3p (unknown function), was the first CTD kinase to be characterized (25Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sterner D.E. Lee J.M. Hardin S.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5716-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This kinase cross-links to genes at all regions of a transcription unit (promoters, 5′-end, coding regions, 3′-end) (28Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The CTDK-I catalytic subunit shares a high degree of similarity with CDK9, the catalytic subunit of metazoan positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb), and CTDK-I and P-TEFb share several functional similarities including stimulation of transcription elongation (29Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10990-10993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and involvement in 3′-end formation (11Ahn S.H. Kim M. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 31Skaar D.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol.

Cell. 2004; 13: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, CTDK-I has been implicated in various other nuclear processes including splicing (33Morris D.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39935-39943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), chromatin modification (34Xiao T. Hall H. Kizer K.O. Shibata Y. Hall M.C. Borchers C.H. Strahl B.D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), and DNA repair (35Ostapenko D. Solomon M.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Determining the positional specificity of phosphorylation by a CTD kinase is one approach to revealing the timing and functional consequences of the activity of a kinase. Ser5 kinases, for example, might be expected to act near promoters and be involved in capping or promoter clearance, whereas Ser2 kinases might be involved in elongation or 3′-end formation. Most of the information about which residues of the CTD are phosphorylated by a CTD kinase has been determined by two methods: 1) comparing the extent of in vitro phosphorylation of wild type CTD substrates with phosphorylation of substrates that have mutations in potential phosphoaccepting residues and 2) comparing reactivity of the CTD with phosphorylation-specific antibodies in wild type strains versus strains with a deleted or inactivated CTD kinase. The results obtained with these techniques are consistent with the idea that the Kin28p, Srb10p, and Bur1p kinases phosphorylate Ser5 of the CTD (10Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 20Murray S. Udupa R. Yao S. Hartzog G. Prelich G. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Although CTDK-I is required for normal CTD phosphorylation in vivo (26Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 149-167PubMed Google Scholar, 28Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 36Patturajan M. Conrad N.K. Bregman D.B. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27823-27828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the exact phosphorylation pattern created by CTDK-I has not been completely determined. CTDK-I has been characterized by genetic interactions between its catalytic subunit gene and rpb1 constructs with point mutations in the CTD (37Lindstrom D.L. Hartzog G.A. Genetics. 2001; 159: 487-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Implicating CTDK-I in Ser5 phosphorylation is the synthetic lethal interaction between ctk1Δ and a mutant rpb1 construct that has a mix of wild type repeats and repeats with alanine substituted for serine at position 5. On the other hand, ctk1Δ is also synthetic lethal with rpb1 constructs that have mutations at position 2. CTDK-I has also been implicated in Ser2 phosphorylation because ctk1Δ strains have reduced H5 mAb epitopes in coding regions of certain genes (28Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Here we more completely characterized the phosphorylation of the CTD by CTDK-I. Using BIACORE technology, we first tested the specificity of monoclonal antibodies commonly used to determine CTD phosphorylation sites and found that mAb H5 binds to CTD peptides with Ser5 and/or Ser2 phosphorylated. In light of this lack of specificity, we sought to determine the site of CTDK-I phosphorylation by direct chemical analysis. We found that CTDK-I phosphorylates Ser5 if the CTD substrate is not phosphorylated at Ser5, but CTDK-I will phosphorylate Ser2 of a CTD substrate if Ser5 is already phosphorylated. In addition, CTDK-I is more reactive toward substrates that are prephosphorylated at serine 2 or 5 compared with an unphosphorylated CTD substrate; therefore, it efficiently creates doubly phosphorylated CTD repeats.

Purification of CTDK-I—CTDK-I was purified based on modification of the CTDK-I purification described in Refs. 25Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The enzyme was tracked through purification by activity assays and Western blotting against Ctk1 and Ctk3 protein subunits. 700 g of Fleischmann yeast were broken open in a 1-gallon stainless steel Waring blender with liquid nitrogen by blending six times for 30 s. The resulting yeast powder was resuspended in 800 ml of buffer B1 (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1:1000 dilution of a saturated solution in isopropyl alcohol), 0.5 mm leupeptin), and debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 50% saturation, and the precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer BH (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 8% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to give a conductivity equal to 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4 and loaded onto 175 ml of DEAE resin. DEAE flow-through was collected, diluted to a conductivity equal to 150 mm KCl, loaded onto a 45-ml CM resin, and eluted with a gradient of KCl in buffer BH. The 300–450 mm KCl fractions contained a peak of kinase activity and CTDK-I proteins. These fractions were further purified on an immunoaffinity resin made with a rabbit antibody raised against and affinity-purified against a peptide (“S2 peptide”; LSRYNDTSFQTSSRYQGSRY) unique to the N terminus of the Ctk1 protein (see Ref. 27Sterner D.E.

Open table in a new tab In Vitro Kinase Activity Assays—Typically, kinase reactions included 270 μm ATP (10 times the apparent enzyme Km for ATP (25Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3624-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)), 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 25mm HEPES, 10–50 ng of CTDK-I, and 1.0 μg of GST-CTD substrate or 5.0 μg of synthetic CTD peptide substrate in a 25-μl reaction volume. Reactions were 1 h at 30 °C (unless otherwise specified). For phosphorylation site determination, higher specific activity of radioactive ATP (100 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) was used to increase radioactive phosphate incorporation. For the time course with biotinylated peptides, reactions were stopped by quenching with 25 mm cold ATP and 100 mm EDTA followed by refrigeration. Biotinylated peptides were precipitated with 25 μl of streptavidin beads and washed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline until radioactivity was undetectable in supernatants (about 10×). Pellets were Cerenkovcounted, and radioactivity incorporation (arbitrarily normalized to a value of 1.0 for the 60-min 2-phospho peptide) was plotted against time. Streptavidin bead precipitation was selected over SDS-PAGE gels, because some phosphorylated peptide species co-migrate with free ATP (data not shown; also see Ref. 40Borggrefe T. Davis R.

Purification of Phosphorylated CTD Peptide Products—Kinase reactions (25 μl) were diluted to 100 μl in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto a C18 HPLC column. After 60 min of washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 1 ml/min, products were eluted with an acetonitrile gradient (0–100% over 30 min at 0.2 ml/min). Peaks of phosphorylated products were identified by Cerenkov counting. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—CTD peptide substrates were phosphorylated in an in vitro kinase assay (as described above). Phosphorylated products were purified by HPLC on a C18 column and incubated in 6 m HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. Hydrolyzed products, along with phosphoamino acid standards (Ser(P), Tyr(P), and Thr(P)), were separated by thin layer chromatography in one dimension on cellulose plates (41Jelinek T. Weber M.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 628-630PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak Biomax MR film. Phosphorylation Site Determination—CTD peptides were phosphorylated in vitro (as described above), and phosphorylated products were separated by HPLC on a C18 column. Peptide immobilization and Edman sequencing were done as described in Ref. 42MacDonald J.A. Mackey A.J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A. Mol.

Determination of Antibody-CTD Affinities Using Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements (BIACORE)—For immobilization of CTD peptides to the streptavidin sensor chip surface, biotinylated CTD peptides (Table I; nonphospho, 2-phospho, 5-phospho, and 2 + 5-phospho peptide) were diluted to ∼5 ng/ml in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. For low density immobilization, about 150 response units (RU) of each CTD peptide were immobilized to the sensor chip by injecting peptides over the surface at 5 μl/min, whereas about 600 RU of each peptide were immobilized to prepare the high density surface. Raw ascites fluid containing monoclonal antibody H5, H14, or 8WG16 was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 to the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Antibodies were interacted with CTD peptides (on the low and high density surfaces) for 300 s at 50 μl/min. Dissociation time was 200 s, followed by surface regeneration with 2 m MgCl2 (100 μl at 50 μl/min). For monoclonal antibodies H5 and H14, apparent equilibrium and kinetic association and dissociation constants were determined by fitting curves to the binding sensorgrams using the Langmuir binding model (A + B = AB) and using the BIAEvaluation software. Using BIAEvaluation software, the goodness of fit was assessed by examining residual plots and χ2 values. In cases where a simple Langmuir model gave a poor fit, additional parameters such as base-line drift or mass transfer were added (as indicated in the figure legends). An acceptable fit could not be obtained for the 8WG16 mAb, but equilibrium constants were determined using Scatchard analysis. Concentrations of monoclonal antibodies in ascites fluid were estimated based on manufacturer literature and stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The stock raw ascites fluids were determined to contain about 3 μm H14, 3 μm H5, and 33 μm 8WG16. Specificity of Monoclonal Antibodies 8WG16, H5, and H14 — Commercially available monoclonal antibodies that are regarded as phosphorylation specific have commonly been employed to determine in vivo CTD phosphorylation patterns and the positional specificity of phosphorylation by CTD kinases. The specificity of these antibodies has previously been characterized based on binding to wild type and mutant CTD substrates in Western blots, pull-downs, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (19Licatalosi D.D.

Because we hoped to use the available mAbs to analyze CTD phosphorylation by CTDK-I, we further characterized their binding properties. We were particularly interested in following up on previous indications that mAb H5 is not specific for serine 2 phosphorylation (19Licatalosi D.D. Geiger G. Minet M. Schroeder S. Cilli K.

Toward this end, surface plasmon resonance measurements (BIACORE) were used to investigate the binding of these antibodies to a set of CTD peptides (Fig. 1A). Because it is currently not possible to chemically synthesize or enzymatically generate long CTD substrates with rigorously known phosphorylation patterns, we used three-repeat synthetic peptides with Ser-PO4 in exactly known positions for the binding analyses. In these experiments, diluted ascites fluid containing either mAb H5, H14, or 8WG16 was interacted with CTD peptides that were immobilized on the surface of a streptavidin sensor chip. In the BIACORE sensorgrams, binding is represented by response units (on the y axis) as a function of time (on the x axis). Monoclonal antibody H14 bound to the 5-phospho and 2 + 5-phospho CTD peptides (Fig. 1B) but not the nonphospho or 2-phospho peptides, consistent with specificity for serine 5 phosphorylation. Also in agreement with previous characterization, mAb 8WG16 bound to the nonphospho CTD peptide with the highest steady state RU level. Binding to the 2-phospho, 5-phospho, and 2 + 5-phospho CTD peptide displayed very rapid dissociation kinetics, and much of the signal response was probably due to nonspecific binding (Fig. 1C). The H5 antibody did not display the specificity that it has previously been thought to possess (Fig. 1D). This antibody bound to CTD peptides that are phosphorylated at serine 5 and/or serine 2 (2-phospho, 5-phospho, and 2 + 5-phospho peptides). To determine apparent association constants for the interaction between each antibody and each CTD peptide, serial 2-fold dilutions of ascites fluid containing each antibody were titrated over the CTD peptides. Sensorgrams for the H5 mAb-peptide interactions are shown in Fig. 2. Antibodies H14 and 8WG16 were also titrated (data not shown). Although the H5 antibody has been considered specific for Ser2 phosphorylation, these sensorgrams show that the H5 mAb bound to 2-phospho (Fig. 2A), 5-phospho (Fig. 2B), and 2 + 5-phospho (Fig. 2C) peptides at antibody dilutions as high as 1:44,800, and binding response increased with increasing concentrations of antibody. The apparent affinities of each antibody for CTD peptides were calculated by curve fitting to data from the mAb titrations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Measured affinities of mAb H5 for the phosphorylated CTD peptides were relatively high, with dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range. The H5 antibody bound to the 5-phospho and 2-phospho peptides with similar high affinities, but this antibody bound to the 2 + 5-phospho peptide with the highest affinity (Fig. 1D and Table II). Curve-fitting analyses also indicated that the H14 antibody bound to the 2 + 5-phospho and the 5-phospho peptides with very similar high affinities (see legend to Table II).Table IIApparent kinetic and affinity constants for antibody H5 binding to CTD peptidesInteractionkonkoffKAKDμm-1 s-1s-1nm-1nmH5-2P15 (9)0.0015"
https://openalex.org/W1988172699,"Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) is currently the only ABC transporter that exports mono- and polyglutamates of folates and methotrexate (MTX). Here we explored the relationship between cellular folate status and BCRP expression. Toward this end, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with low BCRP and moderate multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) levels, and their mitoxantrone (MR)-resistant MCF-7/MR subline, with BCRP overexpression and low MRP1 levels, were gradually deprived of folic acid from 2.3 μm to 3 nm resulting in the sublines MCF-7/LF and MCF-7/MR-LF. These cell lines expressed only residual BCRP mRNA and protein levels and retained a poor MRP2 (ABCC2) through MRP5 (ABCC5) expression. Furthermore, MCF-7/MR-LF cells also displayed 5-fold decreased MRP1 levels relative to MCF-7/MR cells. In contrast, BCRP overexpression was largely retained in MCF-7/MR cells grown in MR-free medium containing 2.3 μm folic acid. Loss of BCRP expression in MCF-7/LF and MCF-7/MR-LF cells resulted in the following: (a) a prominent decrease in the efflux of Hoechst 33342, a BCRP substrate; (b) an ∼2-fold increase in MR accumulation as revealed by flow cytometry; this was accompanied by a 2.5- and ∼84-fold increased MR sensitivity in these cell lines, respectively. Consistently, Ko143, a specific BCRP inhibitor, rendered MCF-7 and MCF-7/MR cells 2.1- and ∼16.4-fold more sensitive to MR, respectively. Loss of BCRP expression also resulted in the following: (c) an identical MTX sensitivity in these cell lines thereby losing the ∼28-fold MTX resistance of the MCF-7/MR cells; (d) an ∼2-fold increase in the 4- and 24-h accumulation of [3H]folic acid. Furthermore, MCF-7/MR-LF cells displayed a significant increase in folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase activity. Hence, consistent with the mono- and polyglutamate folate exporter function of BCRP, down-regulation of BCRP and increased folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase activity appear to be crucial components of cellular adaptation to folate deficiency conditions.

This is the first evidence for the possible role of BCRP in the maintenance of cellular folate homeostasis. Reduced folate cofactors play a key role in one-carbon transfer reactions in the de novo biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate (1Stockstad E.L.R. Piccianno M.F. Stockstad E.L.R. Gregory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). As such, normal and neoplastic dividing cells have an absolute requirement for reduced folates in order to properly initiate and complete DNA replication and mitosis (1Stockstad E.L.R. Piccianno M.F. Stockstad E.L.R. Gregory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar).

Because mammalian cells are devoid of de novo biosynthesis of folic acid, they must obtain this folate vitamin from exogenous sources (1Stockstad E.L.R. Piccianno M.F. Stockstad E.L.R. Gregory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Membrane transport of folates and MTX is mediated by several systems (5Jansen G. Jackman A.L.

Following uptake, the enzyme folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) catalyzes the addition of several equivalents of l-glutamic acid to the γ-carboxyl group in the side chain of folate cofactors and antifolates like MTX (14McGuire J.J. Hsieh P. Coward J.K. Bertino J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5776-5788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This long chain polyglutamate conjugation (up to 10 glutamate residues) is believed to fulfill three cellular functions as follows. (a) By rendering folates and antifolates polyanionic, it dramatically increases their cellular retention by preventing efflux (15Moran R.G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 24-32PubMed Google Scholar). (b) It increases the binding affinity of folate cofactors and antifolates to some folate-dependent enzymes (4Shih C. Chen V.J. Gossett L.S. Gates S.B. MacKellar W.C. Habeck L.L. Shackelford K.A.

(c) It appears to facilitate, via mitochondrial FPGS activity, the accumulation in mitochondria of folate polyglutamates that are required for glycine biosynthesis (15Moran R.G. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 24-32PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular folate pools are controlled by the above folate influx systems, by FPGS activity, and by ATP-dependent efflux transporters of the ABCC sub-family (17Borst P. Oude Elferink R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Recent studies (18Hooijberg J.-H. Broxterman H.J. Kool M. Assaraf Y.G. Peters G.J. Noordhuis P. Scheper R.J. Borst P.

This MTX efflux in various tumor cell lines with MRP overexpression resulted in a significant resistance to MTX predominantly upon a short term (≤4 h) antifolate exposure (18Hooijberg J.-H. Broxterman H.J. Kool M. Assaraf Y.G. Peters G.J. Noordhuis P. Scheper R.J. Borst P. Pinedo H.M. Jansen G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2532-2535PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kool M. van der Linden de Haas M.

The restriction of this antifolate resistance to only a short term drug exposure has been attributed to the ability of these transporters to export only monoglutamate but not polyglutamate conjugates of MTX; indeed, these transporters failed to transport MTX diglutamates or longer chain polyglutamates (21Zeng H. Chen Z.S. Belinsky M.G. Rea M.G. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7225-7232PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chen Z.-S. Lee K. Walther S. Raftogianis R.B. Kuwano M. Zeng H. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3144-3150PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the restricted ability of MRP1 through MRP4 to export only monoglutamate forms of folates and MTX, the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) has been recently found to transport both mono-, di-, and triglutamate conjugates of folic acid and MTX in membrane vesicles isolated from tumor cell lines with BCRP overexpression (23Chen Z.-S. Robey R.W. Belinsky M.G. Schvaveleva I. Ren X.O. Sugimoto Y. Ross D.D. Bates S.E. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4048-4054PubMed Google Scholar, 24Volk E.L. Schneider E. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5538-5543PubMed Google Scholar). This enhanced efflux of MTX in various tumor cell lines with the wild type BCRP (Arg-482) resulted in a marked level of resistance to this drug (25Volk E.L. Rhode K. Rhee M. McGuire J.J. Doyle L.A. Ross D.D. Schneider E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3514-3521PubMed Google Scholar, 26Volk E.L. Farley K.M. Wu Y. Li F. Robey R.W. Schneider E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5035-5040PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the wild type BCRP, two BCRP variants Thr-482 and Gly-482 completely lost their ability to transport folates and MTX (23Chen Z.-S. Robey R.W. Belinsky M.G. Schvaveleva I.

J. 2003; 373: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and therefore displayed a wild type sensitivity to MTX (24Volk E.L. Schneider E. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5538-5543PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from MTX, BCRP also extrudes various anticancer drugs including MR, camptothecin-based and indocarbazole topoisomerase I inhibitors, flavopiridol, and quinazoline ErbB1 inhibitors (28Doyle L.A. Ross D.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7340-7358Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Furthermore, efflux of anthracyclines is variable and appears to depend on the presence of the above BCRP mutation at position 482. Here we initiated studies aimed at exploring the possible involvement of BCRP in the maintenance of cellular folate homeostasis. As a first step toward this end, MCF-7 and MCF-7/MR cells with low and high BCRP levels, respectively, were gradually deprived of folic acid. The resulting cell lines growing under low folate (LF) conditions displayed a nearly complete loss of BCRP mRNA and protein expression. Consequently, these cell lines displayed a prominently diminished Hoechst 33342 efflux activity thereby resulting in markedly increased sensitivity to both mitoxantrone (MR) and MTX. Consistent with the ability of BCRP to export folate triglutamates, these LF-adapted cell lines accumulated significantly more [3H]folic acid than their parental counterparts. Furthermore, these cell lines displayed a significantly increased FPGS activity. These results constitute the first evidence that down-regulation of BCRP expression along with increased FPGS activity are essential components of cellular adaptation to folate deficiency conditions. These findings suggest a functional role for BCRP in the maintenance of folate homeostasis. Chemicals—Folic acid, MTX, and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride were obtained from Sigma. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride was from Cyanamid of Great Britain Ltd. (Gosport, Hampshire, UK). Ko143 was generously provided by Dr. A. H.

The growth medium of MCF-7/MR cells also contained 0.1 μm MR. In order to establish cell lines growing under LF conditions, MCF-7 and MCF-7/MR cells were gradually deprived of folic acid from 2.3 μm (the standard concentration in RPMI 1640 medium) to 3 nm resulting in the sublines MCF-7/LF and MCF-7/MR-LF; this was achieved over a period of 3 and a half months in a folic acid-free RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries, Beth-Haemek, Israel) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) to which gradually decreasing folic acid concentrations were added. In order to examine the stability of BCRP expression during the omission of MR from the growth medium, MCF-7/MR-HF cells were continuously cultured in MR-free medium containing 2.3 μm folic acid. The human ovarian carcinoma cell line, 2008, and its sublines stably transduced with MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 cDNAs were kindly provided by Prof. P. Borst (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), whereas HEK293/MRP4 and HEK293/MRP5 cells were used as positive controls for MRP4 and MRP5 overexpression, respectively. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.3 μm folic acid, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Growth Inhibition with MR and MTX—For MR growth inhibition, cells (1 × 104–1.75 × 104/well) were seeded in 24-well plates in growth medium containing various concentrations of MR for 3–5 days at 37 °C. For MTX growth inhibition, cells were allowed to attach for 24 h at 37 °C. Attached cells were then exposed to various concentrations of MTX for 4 h at 37 °C, following which the drug-containing medium was aspirated, and three successive 10-min washes in RPMI 1640 containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum at 37 °C were performed. Drug-free medium was added (2 ml/well), and cultures were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C. After incubation with MR or MTX, cells were detached by trypsinization, and the number of viable cells was determined by using trypan blue exclusion. Western Blot Analysis of MRPs and BCRP Expression—To examine the expression of various MRPs and BCRP in the different cell lines, non-ionic detergent-soluble proteins were extracted from ∼2 × 107 cells in a buffer (250 μl) containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitors aprotinin (60 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μg/ml), and EGTA (1 mm). Following 1 h of incubation on ice, the extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing the fraction of Triton X-100-soluble proteins was collected, and protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins (6–60 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on 7% (for MRPs) or 10% (for BCRP) polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and electroblotted onto a Protran BA83-cellulose nitrate membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 1% skim milk. The blots were then reacted with the following anti-human MRP monoclonal antibodies (kindly provided by Prof. R. J. Scheper, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands): rat anti-MRP1 (MRP-r1; 1:1000), -MRP4 (M4I-10; 1:500), -MRP5 (M5I-1; 1:750), and -BCRP (BXP-53; 1:1000) as well as mouse anti-MRP2 (M2III-5; 1:50) and -MRP3 (M3II-21; 1:500). Blots were then rinsed in the same buffer for 10 min at room temperature and reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rat IgG (1:10,000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three 10-min washes in TBS at room temperature, enhanced chemiluminescence detection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biological Industries, Beth-Haemek, Israel). To normalize for loading differences, the nylon membranes were stripped and reacted with an antibody against β-tubulin (clone 2-28-33 from Sigma; 1:4000). Immunohistochemistry Studies—Mid-logarithmic monolayers in 24-well plates were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was neutralized by incubation for 20 min in a solution consisting of 4 volumes of methanol and 1 volume of 3% H2O2 in double distilled water. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS, blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 1% skim milk, and reacted with an anti-BCRP monoclonal antibody BXP-53 (1:100 dilution). Then a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:100 dilution) was added. Color development was performed with the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (0.6 mg/ml) in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and 0.02% H2O2. After counterstaining with hematoxylin, cells were examined with an Olympus BH-2 upright light microscope. On-line Efflux of Hoechst 33342—Efflux of Hoechst 33342 was measured by using an on-line computerized method. Cells were cultured on glass coverslips that fitted to the wall of a 1 × 1 × 4-cm cuvette (width, depth, and height, respectively). Cells were loaded with 10 μm Hoechst 33342 for 2 h at 37 °C in a phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) until steady state was achieved. Cells were then transferred to ice until the efflux was initiated. To follow Hoechst 33342 efflux, the coverslips were washed twice with ice-cold medium and then placed in a cuvette that contained 3 ml of warm (37 °C) medium. The fluorescence in the extracellular medium originating from the extruded chromophore was monitored on-line with a spectrofluorometer (FluoroMax, SPEX Industries, Edison, NJ). Hoechst 33342 fluorescence was measured every second at an ultraviolet excitation of 318 nm and emission at 460 nm. To correct for fluctuations in the number of cells/slide, cell numbers were determined by adding 0.4 μm of the DNA dye Syto 13 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The fluorescence of Syto 13 was determined at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 520 nm, respectively. Hoechst 33342 fluorescence was then normalized for the individual Syto 13 signals. [3H]Folic Acid Accumulation—Adherent cells (∼1 × 106) in 6-cm Petri dishes (Nunc) were washed three times in folic acid-free RPMI 1640 containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Following an equilibration for 2 h in the same medium at 37 °C, [3H]folic acid (69 Ci/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA) was added to a final concentration of 1 μm (specific radioactivity 1,200 dpm/pmol) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 and 24 h. Transport was stopped by the addition of 10 ml of ice-cold HBS containing 20 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH (32Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17460-17466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed three times in ice-cold HBS, detached by trypsinization, counted, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the radioactivity was determined using an Ultima Gold scintillation fluid and a scintillation spectrometer (Packard Instrument Co.). Controls for accumulation of radiolabeled folic acid contained a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled folic acid (1 mm). Flow Cytometric Analysis of MR Staining—Exponentially growing MCF-7, MCF-7/MR, and their LF-adapted cell sublines were trypsinized, adjusted to a density of 5 × 105–1 × 106/ml, and incubated in growth medium containing 20 μm MR for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and analyzed for mean fluorescence intensity per cell by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Excitation was at 633 nm and emission at 661 nm. Autofluorescence intensities of unstained cells were recorded and subtracted from those of MR-stained cells. FPGS Activity Assay—Frozen pellets of 2 × 107 cells grown in the absence of drugs for 3–4 passages were suspended in 0.5 ml of an extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. Total cell extracts were obtained by sonication (MSE Soniprep, amplitude 14 μm, three times for 5 s with 10-s intervals at 4 °C) followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The FPGS activity assay mixture contained 200 μg of protein, 4 mm l-[2,3-3H]glutamic acid (specific activity 6.6 mCi/mmol) and 250 μm MTX in a buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 10 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol in a final volume of 250 μl (33Jansen G. Schornagel J.H. Kathmann I. Westerhof G.R. Hordjik G.J. Van der Laan B.F.A.M. Oncol. Res. 1992; 4: 299-305PubMed Google Scholar). Following 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 5 mm unlabeled l-glutamic acid. Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Millipore, Waters Associates, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands) were used for the separation of free, unreacted l-[3H]glutamate from MTX-[3H]diglutamate. Controls lacking MTX were included in order to correct for polyglutamylation of endogenous folates present in the cell extract. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and DNA Sequencing—Following RNA isolation using the TriReagent protocol (Sigma) and cDNA synthesis, a 172-bp human BCRP fragment was PCR-amplified using the upstream primer 5′-TGCCCAAGGACTCAATGCAACA-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-ACAATTTCAGGTAGGCAATTGTG-3′ as described previously (34Kanzaki A. Toi M. Nakayama K. Bando H. Mutoh M. Uchida T. Fukumoto M. Takebayashi Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2001; 92: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and PCR conditions were as described recently (35Rothem L. Aronheim A. Assaraf Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8935-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To analyze whether BCRP in parental MCF-7 cells and their MCF-7/MR subline harbored the wild type Arg-482, we performed DNA sequencing of this region using an ABI Prism 310 DNA Sequencer (AME Bioscience). To this end, BCRP primers were designed using the LightCycler Probe Design Software version 1.0 (Idaho Technology Inc.); the upstream and downstream primers are 5′-CAGCGGATACTACAGAG-3′ and 5′-GCCGTAAATCCATATCGTG-3′, respectively. All cell lines were homozygous for the wild type Arg-482. Statistical Analysis—We used a Student's t test to examine the significance of the difference between two populations for a certain variable. A difference between the average of two populations was considered significant if the p value obtained was <0.05. Loss of BCRP Expression in the LF-adapted Cell Lines as Revealed by Western Blot Analysis—The levels of BCRP as well as MRP1 through MRP5 were determined in MCF-7/LF and MCF-7/MR-LF cells relative to their parental counterparts (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis revealed that folate deprivation in MCF-7/LF cells resulted in an 18-fold decrease in BCRP levels, relative to parental MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A); in contrast, no changes were observed in MRP1 levels (Fig. 1B). Similarly, whereas MR-resistant MCF-7/MR cells displayed an ∼55-fold BCRP overexpression, relative to parental MCF-7 cells, the MCF-7/MR-LF subline expressed only residual BCRP levels (Fig. 1A); remarkably, these barely detectable levels of BCRP in MCF-7/MR-LF cells were ∼4-fold lower than those present in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, folate deprivation in MCF-7/MR-LF cells resulted in a simultaneous 5-fold decrease in MRP1 levels, relative to their parental MCF-7/MR cells (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that when compared with parental MCF-7 cells, MCF-7/MR cells contained 3-fold less MRP1 levels even before gradual folate deprivation was initiated. Most important, MCF-7/MR-HF cells grown in the absence of MR but in the continuous presence of 2.3 μm folic acid had only a slight decrease in BCRP expression, relative to the near-complete loss of BCRP in MCF-7/MR-LF cells (Fig. 1A). Retention of Poor MRP2 through MRP5 Expression in the LF-adapted Cell Lines—MRP2, MRP3, and MRP4 have the facility to export folates, whereas previously, MRP5 was not shown to export folates and MTX (summarized in Ref. 17Borst P. Oude Elferink R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar); therefore, we determined the levels of these transporters in the LF-adapted cell lines (Fig. 1B). MRP2, MRP3, and MRP5 were essentially undetectable in both parental cells and their LF-adapted sublines, whereas MRP4 was expressed at equally low levels in both cells lines (Fig. 1B). Reprobing with a β-tubulin monoclonal antibody was used to correct for any differences in the amounts of Triton X-100-soluble proteins that were being analyzed (Fig. 1, A and B). Poor BCRP Gene Expression in the LF-adapted Cell Lines as Revealed by RT-PCR—We next examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis whether the marked loss of BCRP protein levels in the LF-adapted cell lines was because of decreased BCRP gene expression. Parental MCF-7 cells expressed notable levels of BCRP mRNA, whereas MCF-7/MR-HF cells displayed a prominent overexpression of BCRP mRNA (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the LF-adapted sublines MCF-7/LF and MCF-7/MR-LF contained only residual levels of BCRP mRNA (Fig. 1C, upper panel). An RT-PCR of a housekeeping gene (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) confirmed that comparable levels of cDNA were being analyzed in the various cell lines (Fig. 1C, lower panel).

https://openalex.org/W1999276461,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a key regulator of O2 homeostasis, which regulates the expression of several genes linked to angiogenesis and energy metabolism. Tumor hypoxia has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis in a variety of tumors, and HIF-1 induced by hypoxia plays pivotal roles in tumor progression. The presence of putative HIF-1-binding sites on the promoter of human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) prompted us to examine the involvement of HIF-1 in the regulation of hTERT and telomerase in tumor hypoxia. The telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay revealed that hypoxia activated telomerase in cervical cancer ME180 cells, with peak induction at 24–48 h of hypoxia. Notably, hTERT mRNA expression was upregulated at 6–12 h of hypoxia, concordant with the elevation of HIF-1 protein levels at 6 h. hTERT protein levels were subsequently upregulated at 24 h and later. Luciferase assays using reporter plasmids containing hTERT core promoter revealed that hTERT transcription was significantly activated in hypoxia and by HIF-1 overexpression, and that the two putative binding sites within the core promoter are responsible for this activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay identified the specific binding of HIF-1 to these sites (competing with c-Myc), which was enhanced in hypoxia. The present findings suggest that hypoxia activates telomerase via transcriptional activation of hTERT, and that HIF-1 plays a critical role as a transcription factor. They also suggest the existence of novel mechanisms of telomerase activation in cancers, and have implications for the molecular basis of hypoxia-induced tumor progression and HIF-1-based cancer gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2026846259,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a multifunctional protein involved in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The goal of this study was to determine the role of mTOR in type I collagen regulation. The pharmacological inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, LY294002, significantly inhibited collagen type I protein and mRNA levels. The effects of LY294002 were more pronounced on the collagen α1(I) chain, which was inhibited at the transcriptional and mRNA stability levels versus collagen α2(I) chain, which was inhibited through a decrease in mRNA stability. In contrast, addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, did not alter type I collagen steady-state mRNA levels. This observation and further experiments using an inactive LY294002 analogue suggested that collagen mRNA levels are inhibited independent of PI 3-kinase. Additional experiments have established that mTOR positively regulates collagen type I synthesis in human fibroblasts. These conclusions are based on results demonstrating that inhibition of mTOR activity using a specific inhibitor, rapamycin, reduced collagen mRNA levels. Furthermore, decreasing mTOR expression by about 50% by using small interfering RNA resulted in a significant decrease of collagen mRNA (75% COL1A1 decrease and 28% COL1A2 decrease) and protein levels. Thus, mTOR plays an essential role in regulating basal expression of collagen type I gene in dermal fibroblasts. Together, our data suggest that the classical PI 3-kinase pathway, which places mTOR downstream of PI 3-kinase, is not involved in mTOR-dependent regulation of type I collagen synthesis in dermal fibroblasts. Because collagen overproduction is a main feature of fibrosis, identification of mTOR as a critical mediator of its regulation may provide a suitable target for drug or gene therapy.

A common characteristic of all fibrotic diseases, including scleroderma, is an abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins. Fibrotic lesions disrupt normal tissue architecture and contribute to organ failure. Type I collagen, the primary component of fibrotic lesions, is a triple helix composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain. These chains, although coordinately expressed, are not regulated via the same mechanisms. It is well established that collagen protein degradation, mRNA stability, and transcription are tightly regulated during collagen biosynthesis.

Despite these advances, the pathways controlling collagen biosynthesis are not fully characterized, prompting us to further examine potential signaling molecules involved in type I collagen regulation.Prior studies suggested the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), a ubiquitous lipid kinase, in collagen regulation. For example, Ivarsson et al. (12Ivarsson M. McWhirter A. Borg T.K. Rubin K. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 409-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) described PI 3-kinase as a regulator of collagen production in attached, rounded fibroblasts. However, in the same study, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 did not inhibit collagen production in spread dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, in recent studies, Ricupero et al. (13Ricupero D.A. Poliks C.F. Rishikof D.C. Cuttle K.A. Kuang P.P. Goldstein R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C99-C105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that PI 3-kinase inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin) decreased collagen steady-state mRNA levels in lung fibroblasts. However, it has become clear that LY294002 and wortmannin have multiple targets, suggesting that PI 3-kinase may not be the relevant target. Other candidates include a family of proteins that share significant homology with the PI 3-kinase catalytic domain, a target of LY294002 and wortmannin. For the most part, these proteins act as checkpoints for DNA synthesis, protein translation, and mRNA quality and mediate cellular responses to stresses such as DNA damage and nutrient deprivation. For example, family members DNA-protein kinase (14Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P.

Although initially defined as a translational regulator that exerted its influence through p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) (22Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L.

Although mTOR regulates numerous genes, it in turn is regulated by a variety of stimuli and proteins. For example, c-Abl prevents mTOR phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo (30Kumar V. Sabatini D. Pandey P. Gingras A.C. Majumder P.K. Kumar M. Yuan Z.M. Carmichael G. Weichselbaum R. Sonenberg N. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10779-10787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and protein kinase B (or Akt) has been demonstrated to phosphorylate mTOR on Thr-2446 and Ser-2448, thereby linking mTOR to a mitogenic pathway (31Nave B.T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34496-34501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). mTOR may also regulate its own activity by autophosphorylating on Ser-2481, and mutation of residues Asp-2338 or Asp-2357, within the catalytic domain, abolishes the autophosphorylation reaction (22Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In addition to its kinase function, the presence of HEAT repeats (huntington, elongation factor 2, the A subunit of type 2A protein phosphatase (PP2A) and Tor) (reviewed in Ref. 33Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar) and FAT/FATC domains (FRAP, ATM, and TRRAP C-terminal) and its large size (289 kDa) raise the possibility that mTOR also acts as a scaffolding protein. mTOR has also been shown to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, although the function of this translocation is not clear. Surprisingly, however, no conventional nuclear import signal or nuclear export signal has been in found in the mTOR sequence. Nevertheless, this shuttling seems to be a necessary step in the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4EBP1 (34Kim J.E. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).The PI 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and the structurally unrelated inhibitor wortmannin have helped to elucidate the role of PI 3-kinase in many cellular processes. However, the nonspecific nature of these inhibitors warrants caution. For this reason, rapamycin, which binds the FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12)-rapamycin binding domain (35Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4947-4951Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) of mTOR, is useful in the characterization of PI 3-kinase-independent pathways. Based on previous work showing that PI 3-kinase and related molecules may be involved in collagen gene regulation, the aim of our study was to use these inhibitors and related reagents to ascertain the role of the PI 3-kinase pathway in collagen production. In this study, we show that mTOR inhibition decreases collagen mRNA stability via a PI 3-kinase-independent mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—LY294002, wortmannin, and rapamycin were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

Foreskins were treated with collagenase (Sigma) overnight at 37 °C. Primary fibroblasts cultures were established in 25-cm2 culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS and 2 mm glutamine. Monolayer cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2 until confluence. Cells were then passaged and used for experiments.RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Confluent fibroblasts were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA for 24 h, followed by incubation with inhibitors at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. Control cells received the vehicle (Me2SO). Total RNA was extracted; 3.5 μg of RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (36Yamakage A. Kikuchi K. Smith E.A. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Nylon membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for COL1A1 (kindly provided by Dr. E. Vuorio, Finland), COL1A2 (kindly provided by Dr. R. G. Crystal, New York), and TIMP-1 (as described previously (37Levy M.T. Trojanowska M. Reuben A. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 218-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) and normalized with a probe for 18 S rRNA (5′-ACG GTA TCT GAT CGT CGA ACC-3′) as described previously (38O'Neill L. Holbrook N.J. Fargnoli J. Lakatta E.G. Cardioscience. 1991; 2: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were scanned and quantitated by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).siRNA Transfection—Fibroblast (1.25 × 105) cells were plated in 60-mm2 dishes for the measurement of mTOR, COL1A1, and COL1A2 mRNA levels. Cells were transfected by using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and an mTOR-specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) (Xeragon) (DNA target sequence, TGA GAG GAA AGG TGG CAT C) and a nonsilencing siRNA (Xeragon) (DNA target sequence, AAT TCT CCG AAC GTG TCA CGT). The final concentration of the siRNA was 200 nm. Cells were incubated for 72 h and then total RNA was isolated and treated with DNase I. RNA concentrations were measured by a spectrophotometer and then confirmed by RNA electrophoresis. RNA (500 ng) was amplified by using the Qiagen QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit on the Bio-Rad iCycler. Primers were utilized at a final concentration of 0.3 μm, in a total volume of 25 μl. Amplification was for 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 38 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 73 °C for 30 s, followed by a 5-min extension at 72 °C. Endogenous mTOR levels were quantitated by using a standard curve. Endogenous human mTOR was amplified using upper primer (5′ GGC CGA CTC AGT AGC AT 3′) and lower primer (5′ CGG GCA CTC TGC TCT TT 3′), which yields a 119-bp product.Electroporation and Rat mTOR-KD Amplification—Fibroblasts (3 × 106) cells were resuspended in 750 μl of DMEM. A 200μg aliquot of pcDNA 3 or FLAG-tagged rat mTOR-kinase dead (D2338A) (mTOR-KD) in pcDNA 3 (kindly provided by Robert Abraham, Duke University) was added to the suspension. Suspensions were added to 0.4-cm gap electrocuvettes (Bio-Rad). Samples were electroporated at 0.36 kV and 0.5 microfarads (Gene Pulser® II Electroporation System with Capacitance Extender Plus, Bio-Rad). Samples were brought to a final volume of 3 ml in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Cells were allowed to recover 72 h before collection. Total RNA was isolated from electroporated cells and treated with DNase I. RNA (1 μg) was converted to cDNA by using a random hexamer primer.

In parallel, 3.5 μg of RNA was used for collagen Northern blot analysis.Measurement of Collagen mRNA Message Stability—Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Confluent fibroblasts were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA for 24 h, followed by incubation with inhibitors or Me2SO at the indicated concentrations for 12 h. Actinomycin D (8 μm) was added; and cells were scraped before actinomycin addition and at the indicated time points. Total RNA was extracted; 3.5 μg was analyzed by Northern blotting. Bands were normalized against 28 S and 18 S rRNA. The 0-h time point was set to 1 with the remaining time points relative to this time point. t1/2 was calculated as the amount of time required for the collagen message to decrease 50% from time 0 h. Bands were quantitated using NIH ImageJ software.Measurement of COL1A1 and COL1A2 Transcription—Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Confluent fibroblasts were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA for 24 h followed by incubation with inhibitors at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. Me2SO was added to control cells. Total RNA was isolated and treated with DNase I. RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by using a random hexamer primer. Transcription was measured using a RT-PCR-based method described previously (39Rolfe F.G. Sewell W.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unspliced COL1A1 (newly transcribed, heterogeneous RNA) was amplified using an upper primer to exon 46 (5′-AGG GTG AGA CAG GCG AAC AG-3′) and lower primer to intron 46 (5′-GCC CGA GGG TGT CCA TA-3′) and yielded a 300-bp product. Unspliced COL1A2 was amplified using an upper primer to exon 1 (5′-CGC GGA CTT TGT TGC TGC TTG-3′) and lower primer to intron 1 (5′-GGC CCT TGA CTT CCT CCA CCA C-3′) and yielded a 393-bp product. 18 S rRNA was amplified using the QuantumRNA™ Classic 18 S Standards (Ambion) to a yield a 488-bp product. One microliter of cDNA for unspliced collagen and 0.5 μl of cDNA for spliced and 18 S rRNA were used for amplification. Amplification used primers at a final concentration of 0.6 μm and MgCl2 at a final concentration of 1 mm in a total volume of 50 μl. Unspliced collagens were amplified in the presence of 6% formamide. Amplification was for 95 °C for 5 min, followed by cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s followed by a 5-min extension at 72 °C. Unspliced COL1A1, COL1A2, and 18 S rRNA were amplified for 34, 32, and 23 cycles, respectively. Product sizes were measured using a 100-bp DNA ladder.Measurement of COL1A2 Poly(A) Tail Length—Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Confluent fibroblasts were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA for 24 h. LY294002 (40 μm) or Me2SO was added for 6 h. Actinomycin D (8 μm) was then added, and cells were scraped at the indicated time points. Poly(A) tails were amplified based on the procedure of Salles and Strickland (40Salles F.J. Strickland S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 441-448PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated, and 2 μg of RNA was converted to cDNA using the lower poly(dT) primer. Primers were utilized at a final concentration of 0.6 μm and MgCl2 at a final concentration of 1.5 mm in a total volume of 50 μl. Amplification was for 5 min at 95 °C and then 26 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 59 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s followed by a 5-min extension at 72 °C. The 3′ poly(A) tail was amplified by using upper primer (5′-TGT TCT TTG CCA GTC TCA TTT-3′) and lower poly(dT) primer (5′-GCG AGT CCG CTT TTT TTT TTT TTT T-3′). Product sizes were measured using a 50-bp DNA ladder.Procollagen Analysis on SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel—Fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates and grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Confluent fibroblasts were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid for 24 h. LY294002 was then added at the indicated concentrations for 48 h in the presence of ascorbic acid. l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Proline (20 μCi/ml, 3.66 TBq/mmol) was added during the last 24 h of incubation. Medium was collected from each well, and cells were trypsinized and counted with a Z™ series Coulter® cell counter from Beckman-Coulter Inc. (Miami, FL). Aliquots of medium normalized for cell numbers were concentrated using a Speed-vac, denatured by boiling in SDS sample buffer containing 15 mm dithiothreitol, and loaded on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Media were then electrophoresed, and gels were enhanced using Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) and visualized by autoradiography. The nature of the collagen bands was verified previously by collagenase digestion (41Ichiki Y. Smith E.A. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar).For collagen assays utilizing RNA interference (siRNA), fibroblasts (6 × 104) were plated in 12-well plates. Cells were transfected with the mTOR-siRNA (400 nm) using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) 24 h after plating. Twenty four hours before each time point, applicable wells were placed in serum-free media containing [14C]proline (20 μCi/ml) and ascorbic acid (50 μg/μl). The medium was collected after 48, 72, and 96 h, and cell numbers were counted. Media normalized for cell number were concentrated using Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter devices (Millipore), denatured by boiling in SDS sample buffer containing 15 mm dithiothreitol, loaded on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresed. Gels were enhanced using Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) and visualized by autoradiography.[35S]Methionine-labeled Total Protein Synthesis—Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Confluent fibroblasts were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA for 24 h followed by the addition of LY294002 (80 μm) for 24 h. Cells were then incubated for 30 min in methionine-free DMEM. [35S]Methionine (100 μCi/ml) was added for 3 h. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping. An aliquot of cells was counted to normalize for cell number. Cells were lysed, and protein, normalized for cell number, was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to autoradiography film for 1 h.Akt Western Blot—Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 60-mm2 dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Inhibitors or Me2SO, as a control, were added for 24 h. Cells were then scraped and lysed in ice-cold Lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture set III (2 μl/ml), 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4). Cell lysates were normalized for protein concentrations by using the D.C. protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Lysate (30 μg) was electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 4% milk in Tween 20-TBS (TTBS) for 1 h and then incubated with either anti-phospho-Akt or anti-Akt antibody (1:1000) overnight in (TTBS). After being washed in TTBS three times for 5 min, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:2500) for 1 h. After washing in TTBS three times for 5 min, bands were visualized using ECL reagent. Membranes were stripped as instructed in the ECL protocol and reprobed with the next primary antibody as above.4EBP1 Western Blot—Inhibitors or Me2SO, as a control, were added to confluent fibroblasts in DMEM + 10% FCS for 2 h before scraping. Western blotting was performed as above. Briefly, primary antibody for 4EBP1 was used at a 1:1000 dilution (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Specific binding of antibody was detected with a secondary anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000) (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylation states were observed as changes in electrophoretic mobility. The α band represents the least phosphorylated form, whereas the δ band is the most highly phosphorylated form.In Vitro PI 3-Kinase Assay—Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and then serumstarved in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA for 24 h. Cells were scraped and lysed in ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4). Supernatants, normalized for protein concentrations using the BCA method (Pierce), were incubated with an anti-p85 PI 3-kinase antibody overnight at 4 °C. PI 3-kinase was immunoprecipitated with a 10% pansorbin suspension for 2 h. The pellet was washed in wash buffer 1 (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) followed by wash buffer 2 (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1 mm Na3VO4) and then with wash buffer 3/Assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3V"

Gliomas express elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which have been implicated in the control of proliferation and invasion as well as neovascularization. Progressive loss of LGI1 expression has been associated with the development of high grade gliomas. We have shown previously that the forced re-expression of LGI1 in different glioma cells inhibits proliferation, invasiveness, and anchorage-independent growth in cells null for its expression. Here, using Affymetrix gene chip analysis, we show that reexpression of LGI1 in T98G cells results in the down-regulation of several MMP genes, in particular MMP1 and MMP3. LGI1 expression also results in the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation but not p38 phosphorylation. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway using the pharmacological inhibitors PD98059, U0126, and SB203580 in T98G LGI1-null cells inhibits MMP1 and MMP3 production in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. Treatment of LGI1-expressing cells with phorbol myristate acetate prevents the inhibition of MMP1/3 and restores invasiveness and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that LGI1 acts through the ERK/MAPK pathway. Furthermore, LGI1 expression promotes phosphorylation of AKT, which leads to phosphorylation of Raf1Ser-259, an event shown previously to negatively regulate ERK1/2 signaling. These data suggest that LGI1 plays a major role in suppressing the production of MMP1/3 through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/ERK pathway. Loss of LGI1 expression, therefore, may be an important event in the progression of gliomas that leads to a more invasive phenotype in these cells.

LGI1, a putative tumor metastasis suppressor gene, controls in vitro invasiveness and expression of matrix metalloproteinases in glioma cells through the ERK1/2 pathway. VOLUME 279 (2004) PAGES 23151–23157Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 282Issue 4PreviewIn this article we suggested that phosphorylation of serine 259 in RAFB was part of the signaling cascade that led to down-regulation of MMP production by LGI1. As a result of due diligence in our continued analysis of this system, the suggestion that AKT regulation of RAFB is part of the mechanism by which LGI1 suppresses invasion in T98G cells has now been shown to be due to inadvertent contamination of the control T98G cell stocks with 293 cells. Thus, the AKT/RAFB axis should no longer be considered part of the mechanism that facilitates LGI1 regulation of MMP production in T98G cells. Full-Text PDF Open Access Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common malignant tumor of the adult central nervous system and has a median survival time of less than 12 months (1Feldman A.R.

The highly lethal nature of this tumor results from the acquisition of an invasive phenotype that allows the tumor cells to infiltrate surrounding brain tissue. Despite considerable heterogeneity in the genetic abnormalities detected in the various etiologies and histopathologies of these tumors (3Kleihues P. Cavenee W.K. Pathology and Genetics of Tumors of the Nervous System. IARC Press, Lyon, France2000Google Scholar), 90% of glioblastoma multiformes share losses of regions on chromosome 10 (4Fults D. Pedone C.A.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) identified the LGI1 gene associated with an apparently reciprocal t(10, 19)(q24;q13) chromosome translocation in the T98G glioma cell line. LGI1 is expressed in low grade tumors but not in most of the high grade gliomas or permanent cell lines tested (9Chernova O. Somerville R.P.T. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Besleaga R. Montesinos-Rongen M. Perez-Tur J. Siebert R. Deckert M. Virchows Arch. 2003; 443: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The coincident loss of LGI1 expression with loss of chromosome 10 suggested that it might be important in the malignant progression of gliomas. LGI1 carries a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) 1The abbreviations used are: LRR, leucine-rich repeat; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase. motif (9Chernova O. Somerville R.P.T. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) that places it in the F20 family of LRR genes. Members of this family are predominantly involved in either receptor functions or attachment to the extracellular matrix (11Buchanan S.G. Gay N.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 1-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strongest homology of the LGI1 LRR is with the slit genes (9Chernova O. Somerville R.P.T. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which are involved in the control of axonal movement in Drosophila. The loss of LGI1 function in glial cells at the transition from low grade to high grade tumors also suggested a possible role for this gene in controlling the invasive/migratory potential of these cells. To investigate this possible function in glioma cells, we recently expressed an exogenous copy of the wild type LGI1 gene in glioma cells that do not express detectable levels of LGI1 endogenously (12Kunapuli P. Chitta K. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3985-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Re-expression of LGI1 resulted in a significant reduction in growth potential but, significantly, almost completely suppressed the ability of these cells to invade an extracellular matrix or to form colonies in soft agar. Both of these in vitro phenotypes are indicative of a loss of malignant potential. We suggest, therefore (12Kunapuli P. Chitta K. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3985-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), that LGI1 may be a member of the emerging family of genes referred to as “tumor metastasis suppressors” (13Steeg P.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). To determine whether LGI1 exerts its effect by regulating specific signaling pathways, we used oligonucleotide microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles from T98G cells that do not express LGI1 with those that are forced to re-express it. The re-expression of LGI1 induced the suppression of a number of extracellular matrix genes, including members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, in particular MMP1 and MMP3. High levels of the expression of MMPs have been reported in high grade gliomas, where it is proposed that their action serves to facilitate invasion and metastasis (14Crawford H.C. Matrisian L.M. Invasion Metastasis. 1994; 14: 234-245PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nabeshima K. Inoue T. Shimao Y. Sameshima T. Pathol. Int. 2002; 52: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Recently, Mercapide et al. (16Mercapide J. Decicco R.L. Casresana J.S. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 106: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed that MMP3 is responsible for the invasive phenotype in astrocytomas. Matrix metalloproteinases are a family of structurally related zinc-dependent neutral peptidases collectively capable of degrading essentially all components of the extracellular matrix (17Nagase H. Woessener Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). These genes have been shown to play an important role in controlled tissue remodeling in physiological situations, including developmental morphogenesis, tissue repair, and angiogenesis (18Joansson N. Ahonen M. Kahari V.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 19Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The increased expression of various MMPs by peripheral tumors is strongly associated with invasive phenotypes. We now demonstrate that the re-expression of LGI1 in glioma cells suppresses ERK-dependent expression of MMP1 and MMP3, which correlates with the severe loss of in vitro invasiveness. Several pathways have been reported that lead to activation of MMPs. Using a variety of pathway-specific inhibitors, we now demonstrate that LGI1 affects MMP production predominantly by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK pathway. TriZOL was obtained from Invitrogen. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and protease and phosphatase inhibitors were obtained from Sigma. PD098059, U0126, and SB203580 were from Calbiochem. Antibodies for ERK1/2 were obtained from Upstate Signaling Solutions (Charlottesville, VA). Phospho-ERK, phospho-p38, p38 MAPK, phospho-Akt, and Raf1-phosphoserine 259 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, CA). MMP1 and MMP3 antibodies were purchased from Lab Vision (Freemont, CA). Cell Culture and Treatments—The T98G cell line was maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS under 10% CO2. The T98G LGI1 stable transfectants were maintained in DMEM plus 10% FBS and 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate. For all inhibition assays, inhibitors were added to the cells, which were then kept overnight in serum-free medium pending supernatant collection. For PMA treatment, cells were incubated with the appropriate concentration of the inhibitor for 30 min before the addition of PMA for 10 min. Gene Expression Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from three independently isolated T98G clones that showed exogenous expression of LGI1 and was used to prepare cRNA for hybridization to the Affymetrix U133A oligonucleotide arrays as described previously (20Maitra A. Hansel D.E. Ashfaq R. Rahman A. Naji A. Deng S. Geradts J. Hawthorn L. House M.G. Yeo C.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 5988-5995PubMed Google Scholar). The gene expression profile from these cells was compared with that obtained from T98G clones that had been stably transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector. To compare the vector-only clones with the LGI1-expressing clones, the base line-corrected data were imported into the Affymetrix Data Mining Tool (DMT 4.0) by using the publishing tool MicroDataBase (MDB 3.0). The genes were then sorted using a count and percent tool, and only those genes showing altered expression in at least two of both the vector-only clones and LGI1+ clones (two cross-comparisons) were used to define the final list. A cutoff of an average 2-fold or greater change was selected. The second analysis approach employed the dChip program developed at Harvard for analysis of GeneChip data and was available for downloading from www.dchip.org. This approach is based on the Li and Wong statistical model (21Li C. Hung Wong W.

The Affymetrix Microarray Suite (5.0) generated “.CEL” files were converted into “.DCP” files using dChip. The .DCP files were then normalized, and gene expression data were generated using the dChip system of model-based analysis. The vector-only clones were designated as the baseline (B), and the T98G LGI1 samples were designated as experimental (E). Genes that displayed 2-fold up- or down-regulation in the T98G-LGI1 clones, as compared with clones carrying the vector, were identified by defining the appropriate filtering criteria in the dChip software (mean E mean B > 2; mean E < 2 mean B = 100; p = 0.01; t test). Genes that were found by both data analysis tools to be significantly changed were considered to be consistent between experiments. All functional annotation and chromosomal locations were obtained using NetAffx (22Liu G. Loraine A.E. Shigeta R. Cline M. Cheng J. Valmeekan V. Sun S. Kulp D. Siani-Rose M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis—RNA was isolated from harvested cells using TriZOL (Invitrogen). cDNA was made using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT primers. To amplify MMP1 and MMP3, 1 μg of cDNA was used for each PCR reaction using the following primers: MMP1, 5′-CTTGCTCATGCTTTTCGACCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCGGGTAGAAGGGATTTGTG-3′ (reverse); MMP3, 5′-GAAAGTCTGGGAAGAGGTGACTCCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGTGTTGGCTGAGTGAAAGAGACCC-3′ (reverse); and β-actin, 5′-TGCTTGTAACCCATTCTCTTAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTC-3′ (reverse). Western Blot Analysis—Protein levels of MMP1 and MMP3 were examined in the serum-free supernatants from the cell lines stably transfected with either the pcDNA3 vector or LGI1 by immunoblotting. For all other experiments, total cell extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 0.2% protease- and phosphatase-inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). The extracts were kept on ice for 10 min, after which the supernatants were recovered by centrifugation at 14000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay method. Cell extracts containing 40 μg of protein were size-fractionated in 12% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked using 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%) and then probed overnight at 4 °C with specific primary antibodies diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin. The blots were then washed three times with PBS-Tween 20 for 10 min each wash, and then anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were added as secondary antibodies to the respective membranes at a 1:7500 dilution in 5% nonfat dry milk. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were washed three times with PBS-Tween 20 for 10 min each wash. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the Western Lightning chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), followed by exposure to Kodak X-Omat AR films. Matrigel Chamber Invasion Assay—Matrigel (BD Biosciences) chambers with 8 μm membrane pores, stored at -20 °C, were kept at room temperature for 1 h, after which 750 μl of DMEM was added to the empty wells. The inserts were then transferred to the medium-containing wells. 500 μl of DMEM was added to the inserts and kept at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2 for equilibration. After 2 h, the medium in the inserts was aspirated, and the inserts were placed into the wells containing DMEM and 5% FBS. FBS in this case acts as a chemoattractant for the cells to migrate. 50,000 cells in 500 μl of DMEM were added to the inserts. The plates were incubated for 22 h in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The chamber inserts were then stained using the Diff-Quick staining kit (Dade-Behring, Newark, DE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the membranes were separated with a sterile scalpel and observed using a light microscope. The number of cells that had passed through the membranes were counted as a measure of their migration potential. These assays were performed in triplicate. Casein Zymography—Cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight, and the supernatants were collected and mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer in the absence of reducing agents and electrophoresed through 4-16% gradient polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% (w/v) blue casein (Novex® zymogram gels from Invitrogen). Electrophoresis was carried out at 125 V. After electrophoresis, the gel was equilibrated by incubating in 1× zymogram renaturing buffer (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation to remove the SDS from the gel. 1× zymogram-developing buffer was added to the gel, which was incubated for 48 h at 37 °C to identify the proteolytic activity of the MMP enzymes. The protease activity was then visualized as a negative staining area (clear bands) on the blue casein gel, which otherwise has a dark blue background. The predicted location of the LGI1 protein at or in the cell membrane (9Chernova O. Somerville R.P.T. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), together with the membership of LGI1 in the family of F20 LRR genes, suggests that it may have a signaling function, as do many of these F20 family members (11Buchanan S.G. Gay N.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 1-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we compared the gene expression profile of LGI1-null glioma cells carrying the pcDNA3 vector with clones expressing exogenous LGI1. The full-length LGI1 open reading frame described by Chernova et al. (9Chernova O. Somerville R.P.T. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), fused to a C-terminal FLAG epitope by PCR, was cloned into pcDNA3 and then stably transfected into T98G cells (12Kunapuli P. Chitta K. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3985-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Comparative Gene Expression Analysis—RNA isolated from three independently derived T98G clones that showed exogenous expression of LGI1 (12Kunapuli P. Chitta K. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3985-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used to prepare cRNA for hybridization to the Affymetrix U133A arrays. The gene expression profiles from these cells were compared with those produced from T98G clones transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector. The data from the three clones was then filtered to display only those genes that were at least 2-fold up-regulated or 2-fold down-regulated in all three independent clones compared with the control. Of a total of 22,214 genes and expressed sequence tags analyzed, 614 genes were up-regulated and 475 were down-regulated using the Affymetrix Data Mining Tool analysis alone. However, combining this analysis with dChip, only 189 genes were up-regulated and 15 were down-regulated. Within this series of genes it was striking that a significant number of them were associated with the extracellular matrix (Table I). In addition, several members of the MMP gene family also showed down-regulation. This gene family has been associated with invasion characteristics in brain tumors (23Nakano A. Tani E. Miyazaki K. Yamamoto Y. Furuyama J. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 83: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 24VanMeter T.E. Rooprai H.K. Kibble M.M. Fillmore H.L. Broaddus W.C. Pilkington G.J. J. Neurooncol. 2001; 53: 213-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). MMP1 and MMP3 were the most consistently down-regulated in all of the clones in our analysis. Only one clone showed down-regulation of MMP11 and MMP12. The up-regulation of TIMP3, a known antagonist of MMP action, was also seen in all of the clones expressing LGI1.Table IAffymetrix data showing the increased (left) and decreased (right) fold changes for representative genes that are known to be involved in invasion and metastasis after re-expression of LGI1Gene nameFold changeGene nameFold changeCollagen type III α (COL3A1)58.08Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP3)-17.09Collagen type XIV (COL14A1)28.05Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP1)-5.77Collagen type V α2 (COL5A2)8.00Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP12)-4.30Collagen type I α2 (COL1A2)6.00Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP11)-3.60Collagen type V α1(COL5A1)3.50Collagen type XVIII Gα1 (COL18A1)2.03Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP3)3.27 Open table in a new tab Effect of LGI1 on MMP1 and MMP3 Expression—Because MMP1 and MMP3 were the most consistently and severely down-regulated MMP genes in the T98G/LGI1 cells, we concentrated our subsequent analysis on these two family members (see discussion). Using reverse transcription PCR, we demonstrated that MMP1 and MMP3 are expressed endogenously in the T98G clones that carried the empty vector (Fig. 1A). In contrast, MMP1 and MMP3 transcripts were below detectable levels in cells forced to re-express LGI1. The MMPs are structurally and functionally related zinc-dependent endopeptidases belonging to four different subfamilies (17Nagase H. Woessener Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar), namely collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs). These proteolytic enzymes are secreted as inactive proenzymes (pro-MMPs), which are subsequently activated extracellularly by proteolytic cleavage. To determine whether MMP1 and MMP3 proteins were secreted from the T98G cells, supernatants were harvested from cultures grown overnight in the absence of serum and then analyzed by Western blotting. Analysis using anti-MMP1 and anti-MMP3 antibodies demonstrated high levels of these proteins in the supernatant of the cells carrying the empty vector (Fig. 1B) but not in any of the T98G cell clones expressing LGI1, confirming the LGI1-induced suppression of MMP1/3 mRNA. To determine that the MMPs seen in the parental T98G cells were active, 10 and 20 μl of the supernatants from T98G cells carrying the empty vector were size fractionated on Novex zymogram gels (Fig. 1) and compared with supernatants from T98G clones carrying the exogenous LGI1 gene. MMP activity was clearly seen in cells that did not express LGI1 but was absent in clones that expressed it. These results demonstrate that the presence of LGI1 suppresses MMP activity. Analysis of the ERK and p38 MAPK Pathways—Earlier reports have shown that expression and activation of the MMP1 and MMP3 gene products are coordinately controlled by the activation of various extracellular, signal-related protein kinases, including ERK1/2 and p38. Several reports also indicate that the enhancement of human MMP1 and MMP3 transcription involves the activation of the AP-1 elements in the 5′-flanking regulatory regions of these genes through distinct MAPK pathways (25Westermarck J. Li S.P. Kallunki T. Han J. Kahari V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 26Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that activation of ERK1/2 plays a major role in MMP1/3 expression, whereas the activation of p38 apparently has little effect on the transcriptional activity of the MMP1 gene (25Westermarck J. Li S.P. Kallunki T. Han J. Kahari V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of these signaling pathways controls MMP1 and MMP3 production in the LGI1-expressing T98G cells, we analyzed the ERK proteins in these cells using Western blotting. T98G/vector clones show high levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 2). In contrast, T98G cells expressing LGI1 contained low levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 proteins. Total levels of ERK proteins were unaffected by the re-expression of LGI1 (Fig. 2). In contrast, neither p38 phosphorylation nor total p38 protein levels were affected by LGI1 re-expression (Fig. 2). These results suggest that LGI1 may be controlling the expression of MMP1/3 transcription through the ERK1/2 pathway. To further examine the roles of ERK1/2 in the regulation of MMP1 and MMP3 production by LGI1 (Fig. 3A), we treated the different T98G cell clones with the pharmacological MEK1 inhibitors PD98059 (50 μm) and U0126 (20 μm). Both inhibitors severely diminished relative ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels in the T98G/vector cells (data not shown). In these cells, PD98056 causes complete suppression of MMP1/3 production (Fig. 3A), and U0126 causes significant down-regulation of protein production (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with observations in other cell systems. To investigate the relative role of the p38 pathway in MMP1/3 production, T98G/vector cells were treated with SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38 MAPK pathway. In these experiments, expression of the MMP1/3 was suppressed (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that p38 MAPK is also involved in MMP1/3 production in these cells. Despite the fact that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK seem to be involved in MMP1/3 production in T98G/vector cells, because the phosphorylation status of p38 in T98G/LGI1 clones showed only a marginal decrease, it is apparently not the pathway through which LGI1 exerts its biological effect. Effect of PMA on ERK1/2 Activation and MMP Production—In some cell systems, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) activates the RAF1-MEK-ERK signaling pathway (27Besson A. Davy A. Robbins S.M. Yong V.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7398-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PKC also activates MMP1 production in malignant glioma cells (28Yabkowitz R. Meyer S. Black T. Elliott G. Merewether L.A. Yamane H.K. Blood. 1999; 93: 1969-1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PKC activation affects MMP production in T98G/vector and T98G/LGI1 cells that express exogenous LGI1, we treated these cells with PMA, a pharmacological activator of PKC. This treatment resulted in a further increase in the normal steady state expression levels of MMP1 and MMP3 in T98G/vector cells (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of LGI1 on MMP expression was abolished in T98G/LGI1 cells (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the LGI1-mediated inhibition of MMPs is sensitive to the activation of PKC. The PMA-induced reactivation of MMP1/3 in T98G/LGI1 was accompanied by phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 4) This result confirms the earlier suggestion (Fig. 2) that MMP1/3 production is regulated through the ERK pathway. To assess the migration potential of the T98G cells following treatment with PMA, we performed Matrigel matrix invasion assays (Fig. 5). T98G cells transfected with pcDNA3 migrate freely through these substrates, whereas T98G cells expressing exogenous LGI1 do not (Fig. 5). However, when T98G/LGI1 cells were treated with PMA, they were able to migrate through the Matrigel matrix membrane (Fig. 5). In contrast, when these cells were treated with PD98059 alone and in combination with PMA, they were no longer able to pass through the matrix, thus behaving in a similar matter to cells forced to re-express LGI1 (Fig. 5). These data demonstrate that LGI1-mediated inhibition of invasiveness can be reversed as a result of activating PKC.Fig. 5When the effect of migration through a Matrigel matrix was analyzed, T98G/vector cells showed high levels of invasion, whereas T98G/LGI1 cells did not (clone 2 is shown as an example). Constitutive activation of the ERK1/2 pathway using PMA maintains the invasion capability in the T98G/vector cell"
https://openalex.org/W2032348811,"Frequent mutations of coding nucleotide repeats are thought to contribute significantly to carcinogenesis associated with microsatellite instability (MSI). We have shown that shortening of the poly(T)11 within the polypyrimidine stretch/accessory splicing signal of human MRE11 leads to the reduced expression and functional impairment of the MRE11/NBS1/RAD50 complex. This mutation was selectively found in mismatch repair (MMR) defective cell lines and potentially identifies MRE11 as a novel target for MSI. Here, we examined 70 microsatellite unstable primary human cancers and we report that MRE11 mutations occur in 83.7 and 50% of the colorectal and endometrial cancers, respectively. In the colorectal cancer series, mutated MRE11 is more frequently associated with advanced age at diagnosis and A/B stages. Biallelic mutations were present in 38.8% of the cases and more frequently associated with lower (G1/G2) grade tumors. Impaired MRE11 expression was prevalent in primary colorectal tumors with larger and biallelic shortening of the poly(T)11. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the impaired MRE11 expression and revealed NBS1-defective expression in MRE11 mutated cancers. Together with the observation that perturbation of the MRE11/NBS1/RAD50 complex predisposes to cancer, our work highlights MRE11 as a new common target in the MMR deficient tumorigenesis and suggests its role in colorectal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2051066976,"p21 is a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases capable of arresting cell cycle progression. p21 is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level by several transcription factors, including p53. Previously, we reported that certain members of the E2F family of transcription factors may activate p21 transcription via a p53-independent mechanism. To further elucidate the consequences of E2F-1-regulated induction of p21, we developed cell lines with a tamoxifen-dependent form of E2F-1. We confirmed direct interaction of E2F-1 with the proximal region of the p21 promoter. Interestingly, elevated E2F-1 activity was sufficient to arrest a substantial subset of cells in S phase and this effect was correlated to and dependent on the induction of p21 protein. Since E2F proteins control genes required for cell cycle progression and are activated by various oncogenic events, we believe that the p21-dependent arrest described in this report represents an additional mechanism that guards against unrestricted cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1979149072,"Ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) induces oxidative renal damage leading to a high incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in rats. Differential display analysis of such RCCs revealed elevated expression of annexin 2 (Anx2), a substrate for kinases and a receptor for tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen. We conducted this study to clarify the significance of Anx2 in Fenton reaction-based carcinogenesis. Messenger RNA and protein levels of Anx2 were increased time-dependently in the rat kidney after Fe-NTA administration as well as in LLC-PK1 cells after exposure to H2O2. The latter was inhibited by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or catalase. Immunohistochemistry revealed negligible staining in the normal renal proximal tubules, but strong staining in regenerating proximal tubules, karyomegalic cells and RCCs. Metastasizing RCCs showed higher Anx2 protein levels. Anx2 was phosphorylated at serine and tyrosine residues in these cells and coimmunoprecipitated with phosphorylated actin. Overexpression of Anx2 induced a higher cell proliferation rate in LLC-PK1 cells. In contrast, a decrease in proliferation leading to apoptosis was observed after Anx2 antisense treatment to cell lines established from Fe-NTA-induced RCCs. These results suggest that Anx2 is regulated by redox status, and that persistent operation of this adaptive mechanism plays a role in the proliferation and metastasis of oxidative stress-induced cancer."

To define the cleavage region in the juxtamembranous NC16A linker domain and assess its structure and requirements for shedding, we constructed deletion mutants of the NC16A domain, expressed them in COS-7 cells, and analyzed their structural integrity and shedding behavior. A mutant lacking the furin consensus sequence was shed in a normal manner, demonstrating that furin does not cleave collagen XVII but rather activates ADAMs (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase). Large deletions of the NC16A domain prevented shedding, and analysis of defined smaller deletions pointed to the stretch of amino acid residues 528–547 as important for sheddase recognition and cleavage. Secondary protein structure predictions showed that deletion of this stretch resulted in an NC16A domain with a positive net charge and an amphipathic α-helix, which can cause conformational changes in the collagen XVII homotrimer. Assessment of triple-helix folding of the mutants revealed a lower thermal stability of all non-shed variants than of wild-type collagen XVII or the shed mutants. In contrast, deletion of the putative nucleation site for triple-helix folding of collagenous transmembrane proteins did not affect folding of collagen XVII.

https://openalex.org/W2111678604,"RRR-α-tocopheryl succinate (α-vitamin E succinate, VES), one of the vitamin E derivatives, can effectively inhibit the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells. However, little is known about its effect on prostate cancer cell invasive ability. Tumor metastasis is a complex process and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is the first barrier that tumor cells encounter. Therefore, we tested the effect of VES on the invasion of different prostate tumor cells, PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP, through Matrigel, a reconstituted ECM, using an in vitro cell invasion assay. The invasion of PC-3 and DU-145 cells through Matrigel was inhibited by 20 μ M VES after treating for 24 h. The condition did not alter cell survival, cell cycle, cell adhesion or cell motility. We further investigated whether the ability of VES to inhibit prostate cancer cell invasiveness was associated with its ability to inhibit the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the key enzymes in the proteolysis of basement membrane during invasion. PC-3 and DU-145 cells that were treated with VES showed a significant reduction in the levels of MMP-9 in the culture medium. In contrast, LNCaP cells, which did not secrete MMP-9, were poorly invasive in Matrigel and were hardly affected by treatment with VES. This is the first report suggesting that VES inhibits human prostate cancer cell invasiveness and the reduction of secreted MMP-9 activity could be one of the contributory factors, which points to the potential use of VES in the prevention and therapy of prostate cancer invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2027915529,"Several databases have been published to predict alternative splicing of mRNAs by analysing the exon linkage relationship by alignment of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to the genome sequence; however, little effort has been made to investigate the relationship between cancers and alternative splicing. We developed a program, Alternative Splicing Assembler (ASA), to look for splicing variants of human gene transcripts by genome-wide ESTs alignment. Using ASA, we constructed the biosino alternative splicing database (BASD), which predicted splicing variants for reference sequences from the reference sequence database (RefSeq) and presented them in both graph and text formats. EST clusters that differ from the reference sequences in at least one splicing site were counted as splicing variants. Of 4322 genes screened, 3490 (81%) were observed with at least one alternative splicing variants. To discover the variants associated with cancers, tissue sources of EST sequences were extracted from the UniLib database and ESTs from the same tissue type were counted. These were regarded as the indicators for gene expression level. Using Fisher's exact test, alternative splicing variants, of which EST counts were significantly different between cancer tissues and their counterpart normal tissues, were identified. It was predicted that 2149 variants, or 383 variants after Bonferroni correction, of 26 812 variants were likely tumor-associated. By reverse transcription–PCR, 11 of 13 novel alternative splicing variants and eight of nine variants' tissue specificity were confirmed in hepatocelluar carcinoma and in lung cancer. The possible involvement of alternative splicing in cancer is discussed."

We are interested in the biology of various DNA helicases that influence homologous recombination and DNA repair processes. One such helicase is encoded by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SRS2 gene, altered forms of which were first described as either suppressors of the DNA damage sensitivity of rad6 and rad18 mutants (6Lawrence C.W. Christensen R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 866-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or as hyperrecombination mutants (7Aguilera A. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1988; 119: 779-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed genetic analyses have shown that a major function of SRS2 is to attenuate homologous recombination activity to allow for the channeling of certain DNA lesions into the RAD6/RAD18-mediated postreplication repair pathway (8Chanet R. Heude M. Adjiri A. Maloisel L. Fabre F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4782-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Rong L. Palladino F. Aguilera A. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1991; 127: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, srs2 mutants are sensitive to DNA damaging agents and show a hyperrecombination phenotype. Genetic deletion of the RAD51 or RAD52, key members of the RAD52 epistasis group functioning in homologous recombination, alleviates the DNA damage sensitivity and hyperrecombination phenotypes of srs2 mutants (8Chanet R. Heude M. Adjiri A. Maloisel L. Fabre F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4782-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), implicating untimely recombination events as the progenitor of these srs2 phenotypes. Srs2 mutations are lethal when combined with mutations in a variety of genes needed for DNA repair and other chromosomal processes, e.g. with mutations in the DNA repair and recombination gene RAD54 and also with mutations in SGS1, which codes for the sole RecQ helicase in S. cerevisiae (10Lee S.K. Johnson R.E. Yu S.L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1999; 286: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Gangloff S. Soustelle C. Fabre F. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The synthetic lethality encountered in the srs2 sgs1 and srs2 rad54 double mutants is suppressed by inactivating key recombination genes (11Gangloff S. Soustelle C. Fabre F. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The available genetic evidence therefore implicates Srs2 protein in the attenuation of recombination events that produce toxic DNA structures or nucleoprotein intermediates (12Klein H.L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 557-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Klein H.L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In congruence with the genetic data, biochemical assays have shown that the Srs2 protein strongly suppresses the recombinase activity of Rad51. Interestingly, although Srs2 has the ability to unwind DNA (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 15Veaute X. Jeusset J. Soustelle C. Kowalczykowski S.C. Le Cam E. Fabre F. Nature. 2003; 423: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) and had been predicted to dissociate DNA intermediates in recombination reactions, its antirecombinase function can be attributed to an ability to disassemble the Rad51-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; MMS, methylmethane sulfonate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; RPA, replicative protein A. nucleoprotein filament (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 15Veaute X. Jeusset J. Soustelle C. Kowalczykowski S.C. Le Cam E. Fabre F. Nature. 2003; 423: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), the key catalytic intermediate in recombination reactions (16Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Likewise, the failure of srs2 mutants to recover from or adapt to DNA damage checkpoint-imposed G2/M cell cycle arrest has been linked to a failure to remove Rad51 from DNA (17Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These results imply that, in addition to its ability to unwind double-stranded DNA, Srs2 has a motor activity that clears proteins from single-stranded DNA. Srs2 physically interacts with Rad51 in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that complex formation between Srs2 and Rad51 helps target the former to DNA sites where Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments have assembled (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In addition to the recombination-related phenotypes, the srs2Δ mutant is partially deficient in the activation of the intra-S DNA damage checkpoint in response to treatment with methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) (18Liberi G. Chiolo I. Pellicioli A. Lopes M. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Foiani M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5027-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Additionally, two independent studies (19Aylon Y. Liefshitz B. Bitan-Banin G. Kupiec M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1403-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Ira G. Malkova A. Liberi G. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) have implicated SRS2 in DNA double-strand break repair by the synthesis-dependent single-strand annealing mechanism as well. Srs2 also appears to influence the efficiency of single-strand annealing (17Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As summarized above, Srs2 appears to have a multifunctional role in nuclear processes including an ability to unwind DNA and disassemble the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. Here, we address the role of ATP in Srs2 protein functions by mutating the highly conserved lysine residue in the Walker type A motif expected to be involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. We show that the resulting srs2 K41A and srs2 K41R mutant proteins are devoid of ATPase and helicase activities and are unable to dislodge Rad51 from DNA. Genetic analyses reveal that the srs2 K41A and srs2 K41R mutations cause hyperrecombination, sensitivity to MMS, and synthetic lethality with the sgs1Δ or rad54Δ mutation. Our results thus reveal a requirement for the Srs2 DNA motor activity in recombination attenuation. However, the srs2 K41A and srs2 K41R mutants are less sensitive to MMS than srs2 null cells and exhibit a more pronounced hyperrecombinational phenotype than the latter. It therefore seems possible that Srs2 has additional functions that are not strictly linked to ATP hydrolysis and Rad51 removal from DNA. Yeast Media and Strains—Yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium, synthetic complete (SC) medium, and synthetic complete media without leucine (SC-Leu), without uracil (SC-Ura), and without leucine and uracil (SC-Leu-Ura) were prepared as described (21Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 3-21Google Scholar). Media containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid were prepared as described (21Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 3-21Google Scholar). Except where noted, all strains are RAD5 derivatives of W303 (22Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Genetics. 1989; 123: 725-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining strains were derived from HKY344-27C and carry leu2-112::URA3::leu2-k and his3-513::TRP1::his3-537 recombination reporters (7Aguilera A. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1988; 119: 779-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—To generate the SRS2::pUC18 plasmid, the ORF of SRS2 was amplified using the following primers: CGGGATCCACATATGTCGTCGAACAATGATCTTTGGTTGC (sense, BamHI site italic, NdeI underline) and CGGGATCCGGAATTCCCTACTAATCGATGACTATGATTTCACCG (antisense, BamHI site italic, EcoRI site underline). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI-digested pUC18. The mutations in the Walker A site in Srs2, K41A, and K41R, were introduced by using mutagenic DNA primers and QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For protein purification, the srs2 K41R and srs2 K41A mutant genes were introduced into the pET11c vector. pBS::SRS2 and YIpLac211-srs2 were constructed as follows. The 3.1-kb NdeI-BglII fragments containing the K41R or K41A segments of the mutated SRS2 gene were used to replace the wild-type SRS2 segment in plasmid pRL101 (9Rong L. Palladino F. Aguilera A. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1991; 127: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, a 6.4-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment containing all of the SRS2 coding region plus 927 bp upstream of the ATG start codon and 1602 bp downstream of the stop codon was inserted into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the polylinker of YIpLac211, which carries the URA3 selectable marker, to form pHK284 (srs2 K41A) and pHK286 (srs2 K41R). These plasmids were linearized with BglII and then used to transform W303 and HKY344-27C strains. After selecting for Ura+ transformants, cells were grown non-selectively and then streaked on 5-fluoro-orotic acid plates. Fluoro-orotic acid-resistant colonies were tested for MMS sensitivity. MMS-sensitive colonies were examined for the presence of the srs2 mutations by PCR amplification of the genomic region surrounding the SRS2 K41 site. Primers used were CTTTTTCTTTTGCGCTGTAT and TCCCGAACTAAAGAAGGTGC. The mutant srs2 K41A and K41R sites carry an adjacent StyI site that is not present in the wild-type sequence. PCR products were tested for the StyI site by restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. Srs2 Expression and Purification—srs2 K41A and srs2 K41R proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified to near homogeneity as described previously for wild-type Srs2 (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 23Van Komen S. Reddy M.S. Krejci L. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44331-44337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Rad51 was overexpressed in yeast and purified to near homogeneity as described (16Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The concentration of the wild-type Srs2 and mutant srs2 proteins was determined by densitometric scanning of SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing multiple loadings of purified proteins against known quantities of bovine serum albumin. The concentrations of Rad51 and RPA were determined using extinction coefficients of 1.29 × 104 and 8.8 × 104 at 280 nm, respectively (24Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). DNA Substrates—The H2 and D1 oligonucleotides used in the construction of the helicase substrate have been described (23Van Komen S. Reddy M.S. Krejci L. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44331-44337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Oligo-1 used in the DNA binding experiments has also been described (25Krejci L. Song B. Bussen W. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40132-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were purified from 12% polyacrylamide gels and 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The unincorporated nucleotide was removed from the oligonucleotides using Spin30 columns (Bio-Rad). The DNA helicase substrate was obtained by heating equimolar amounts of H2 and radiolabeled D1 oligonucleotides to 95 °C for 10 min in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl), followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The annealed substrate was purified from a 12% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, as described (23Van Komen S. Reddy M.S. Krejci L. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44331-44337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ϕX174 (+) strand was purchased from New England Biolabs. ATPase Assay—Srs2 (35 nm) was incubated with viral ssDNA (25 μm nucleotides) in 10 μl of buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm KCl, and 100 μg/ml BSA) and 1 mm [γ-32P] ATP for the indicated times at 37 °C. The released phosphate was separated from unhydrolyzed ATP by thin layer chromatography, as described (26Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The levels of hydrolysis were determined by phosphorimaging analysis of the thin layer chromatography plates in a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). DNA Helicase Assay—Srs2 (20 and 40 nm), srs2 K41R (40 and 80 nm), or srs2 K41A (40 and 80 nm) was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min with the helicase substrate (300 nm nucleotides) in 10 μl of buffer H (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, and 100 μg/ml BSA). The reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis in a 12% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel run in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. The gel was dried onto Whatman DE81 paper and analyzed in the PhosphorImager. DNA Mobility Shift—Varying amounts of Srs2, srs2 K41A or srs2 K41R (0-80 nm) was incubated with 32P-labeled oligo-1 (1.36 μm nucleotides) at 37 °C in 10 μl of buffer D (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml BSA) for 10 min. After the addition of gel loading buffer (50% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% orange G), the reaction mixtures were resolved in 12% native polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C, and the DNA species were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). To release the DNA substrate from bound Srs2 and srs2 mutants, the reaction mixtures were treated with 0.5% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 10 min before being subject to electrophoresis. Binding of Srs2 to Rad51 Affi-beads—Affi-gel 15 beads containing Rad51 (Affi-Rad51; 5 mg/ml) and bovine serum albumin (Affi-BSA, 12 mg/ml) were prepared as described previously (26Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Purified Srs2, srs2 K41A, or srs2 K41R, 5 μg of each, was mixed with 5 μl of Affi-Rad51 or Affi-BSA in 60 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) for 30 min on ice. The beads were washed twice with 150 μl of the same buffer before being treated with 25 μl of 2% SDS to elute bound protein. The starting material, a supernatant that contained unbound Srs2, srs2 K41A, or srs2 K41R, and the SDS eluate, 10 μl of each, were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. D-loop Reaction—The reactions were carried out in Buffer R (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.0 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, containing an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate, 20 μg/ml creatine kinase) and had a final volume of 12.5 μl. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide D1 (3 μm nucleotides) was incubated with Rad51 (1 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C to assemble Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments, followed by the incorporation of Rad54 (150 nm) and RPA (200 nm) and a 2 min incubation at 23 °C. The D-loop reaction was initiated by the addition of pBluescript replicative form I DNA (50 μm base pairs). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 4 min, deproteinized by treatment with SDS (0.5%) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min, and then run in a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer. The gel was dried and subject to phosphorimaging analysis. The percentage D-loop refers to the quantity of the replicative form I substrate that had been converted into D-loop. When present, Srs2 (40, 50, and 60 nm), srs2 K41A (60 and 90 nm), and srs2 K41R (60 and 90 nm) were added to the pre-assembled Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments, followed by a 4-min incubation at 37 °C before Rad54 and RPA were incorporated. Transfer of Rad51 to Bead-bound Biotinylated dsDNA—M13mp18 circular (+) strand (7.2 μm nucleotides) was incubated for 5 min with Rad51 (2.4 μm)at37 °C, followed by the addition of Srs2 (60 and 90 nm), srs2 K41A (90 and 180 nm), or srs2 K41R (90 and 180 nm) in a final volume of 20 μl of buffer R containing 0.01% igepal. After 3 min at 37 °C, 4 μl of magnetic beads containing dsDNA (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) were added to the reaction mixture, followed by constant mixing for 5 min at 23 °C. The beads were captured with the Magnetic Particle Separator (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), washed twice with the same buffer, and the bound Rad51 was eluted with 20 μl of 1% SDS. The supernatant, which contained unbound Rad51, and the SDS eluate (10 μl of each) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Electron Microscopy—The reactions were carried out in buffer R and had a final volume of 12.5 μl. To assemble the Rad51 presynaptic filament, M13mp18(+) strand (7.2 μm nucleotides) and Rad51 (2.4 μm) were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by the addition of RPA (350 nm) and a 3 min incubation. To test the effects of Srs2 and mutant srs2 proteins, 60 nm of these proteins were incubated with the pre-assembled Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments at 37 °C for 3 min. For electron microscopy, 2.5 μl of each reaction mixture was applied to copper grids coated with thin carbon film, after glow-discharging the grids for 2 min. The grids were washed twice with buffer R and stained for 30 s with 0.75% uranyl formate. After air-drying, the grids were examined with a Philips Tecnai 12 electron microscope under low-dose conditions. Images were recorded with a charge-coupled device camera (Gatan). Genetic Studies—MMS sensitivity was determined using freshly made YPD plates containing 0.016% MMS. Overnight cultures of strains to be tested were serially diluted, and 3-μl aliquots of each dilution were applied onto YPD and YPD+MMS plates. Growth was assessed after 2 and 3 days at 30 °C. Forward mutation rates of CAN1 were determined in haploid CAN1 strains by fluctuation tests. These tests were conducted according to the median method (27Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. J. Genet. 1949; 119: 264-284Crossref Scopus (1092) Google Scholar) and were repeated three to five times for each genotype. Gene conversion between intrachromosomal leu2-112 and leu2-k as well as between his3-513 and his3-537 heteroalleles was measured in haploid strain HKY344-27C and its isogenic derivatives. srs2 Variants Mutated for the Walker Type A ATP Binding Motif—Srs2 contains canonical Walker-type ATP binding motifs. For addressing the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis in Srs2 functions, we have substituted the highly conserved lysine residue (lysine 41) in the Walker type A motif with either alanine or arginine using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1A). The srs2 K41A and srs2 K41R mutant genes were sequenced to ensure that no unintended change had been introduced during the mutagenesis procedure. To express the srs2 K41A and srs2 K41R proteins, the mutant genes were placed under the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter in the E. coli expression vector pET11c, which we previously used for the expression and purification of wild-type Srs2 (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Expression of the srs2 K41A and srs2 K41R mutant proteins in E. coli was verified by SDS-PAGE analysis of cell extracts (Fig. 1B) and by immunoblot analysis of these extracts with affinity-purified anti-Srs2 polyclonal antibodies (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The srs2 K41A and srs2 K41R mutant proteins were purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1C) using the chromatographic procedure that we have developed for wild-type Srs2 (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Biochemical Properties of srs2 K41A and srs2 K41R Mutant Proteins—Based on studies with the equivalent Walker mutations in other DNA-dependent ATPases (28Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 29Sung P. Stratton S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the srs2 K41A and srs2 K41R mutant proteins were expected to be defective in ATP hydrolysis. This expectation was confirmed by examining the ATPase activity of purified proteins with [α-32P] ATP and thin layer chromatography (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 23Van Komen S. Reddy M.S. Krejci L. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44331-44337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We showed previously that ATP hydrolysis by Srs2 occurs only in the presence of DNA with ssDNA being much more effective than dsDNA in this regard (9Rong L. Palladino F. Aguilera A. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1991; 127: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Van Komen S. Reddy M.S. Krejci L. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44331-44337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig. 2A, although robust ATPase activity was observed with wild-type Srs2 in the presence of ssDNA (14Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 23Van Komen S. Reddy M.S. Krejci L. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44331-44337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the two srs2 mutant proteins showed less than 1% of the wild-type level of ATP hydrolysis. Likewise, no significant ATP hydrolysis by either of the srs2 mutants was seen when the ssDNA was omitted or substituted with dsDNA (data not shown). We next examined the two srs2 mutant proteins for DNA helicase activity using a 32P-labeled substrate that contained a 40-bp duplex region adjacent to a 40-nucleotide 3′-ssDNA overhang (Fig. 2B and Ref. 23Van Komen S. Reddy M.S. Krejci L. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44331-44337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, although wild-type Srs2 at 40 nm unwound greater than 70% of the substrate after 5 min of incubation, neither of the srs2 mutants, even at the increased concentration of 80 nm, showed a significant helicase activity under the same conditions (Fig. 2B) or even after a prolonged incubation (data not shown). Even though the results presented in Fig. 2 were consistent with the premise that the K41A and K41R mutations abolish the ATPase activity of Srs2, there existed the possible caveat that this defect had originated from a loss of DNA binding by the mutant proteins. For this reason, we compared the DNA binding ability of the two Walker mutants to that of the wildtype protein by a DNA mobility shift assay. To do this, increasing amounts of wild-type Srs2 and the two mutant proteins were incubated with a 32P-labeled 83-mer oligonucleotide, followed by resolution of the reaction mixtures in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and phosphorimaging analysis of the dried gels to detect and quantify the DNA mobility shift. As shown in Fig. 3, both srs2 mutant proteins were just as proficient as wild-type Srs2 in DNA binding. Consistent with this result, using the same DNA substrate, we found that DNA binding by wild-type Srs2 and the two srs2 mutant proteins is not influenced by ATP (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2025781304,"Four major proteins designated DB1, DB2, DB3, and DB4 were isolated and characterized from the yam tuber Dioscorea batatas. The ratios of their yields were 20:50:20:10. DB1 was a mannose-binding lectin (20 kDa) consisting of 10-kDa subunits and was classified as the monocot mannose-binding lectin family. DB2, accounting for 50% of the total protein, was the storage protein, commonly called dioscorins consisting of a 31-kDa subunit. On the basis of amino acid sequence, DB2 was classified to be dioscorin A. DB3 was a maltose-binding lectin, having an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa and composed of a 66-kDa subunit and two 31-kDa subunits (DB3S). The 66-kDa subunit was further composed of two 31-kDa subunits (DB3L) cross-linked by disulfide bonds. DB3L and DB3S (242 and 241 amino acid residues, respectively) were homologous with each other with 72% sequence identity. They showed a sequence homology to dioscorin B and dioscorin A from Dioscorea alata, with 90 and 93% identity, respectively, and to carbonic anhydrase from Arabidopsis thaliana with about 45% identity. DB3S had one intrachain disulfide bond located at Cys28–Cys187, whereas DB3L had one interchain disulfide bond (Cys40–Cys40′) in addition to the intrachain disulfide bond (Cys28–Cys188) to form a 66-kDa subunit. DB1 and DB3 agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes at 2.7 and 3.9 μg/ml, respectively. Despite the structural homology between DB2 and DB3, DB2 had no lectin activity. The 66-kDa subunit itself revealed the full hemagglutinating activity of DB3, indicating that DB3L but not DB3S was responsible for the activity. The hemagglutinating activity of DB3 required Ca2+ ions and was exclusively inhibited by maltose and oligomaltoses (e.g. maltopentaose and maltohexaose) but not by d-glucose. DB3 could not be classified into any known plant lectin family. DB4 was a chitinase, homologous to an acidic chitinase from Dioscorea japonica. DB1, DB2, and DB3 did not show any activity of carbonic anhydrase, amylase, or trypsin inhibitor activity. These results show that two of the four major proteins isolated from the yam tubers D. batatas have unique lectin activities.

DB1, DB2, and DB3 did not show any activity of carbonic anhydrase, amylase, or trypsin inhibitor activity. These results show that two of the four major proteins isolated from the yam tubers D. batatas have unique lectin activities. Yam is the common name applied to plants of about 500 species of the genus Dioscorea of the Dioscoreaceae family. Yam is an important staple crop, which is basically made up of carbohydrates but also constitutes an important source of proteins accounting for 1–3% of the fresh tubers (1Shewry P. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2003; 91: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Over 80% of the protein represents the storage protein. Dioscorins, the major storage proteins in tubers of Dioscorea rotundata, consist of polypeptides of 31 kDa (2Harvey P. Boulter D. Phytochemistry. 1983; 22: 1687-1693Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The storage proteins are not structurally related to other storage proteins such as patatin from potato (Solanum tuberosum) (3Racusen D. Foote M. J. Food Biochem. 1980; 4: 43-52Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and sporamin from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) (4Maeshima M. Sasaki T. Asahi T. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 1899-1902Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Storage proteins have been accepted to be the storehouses of nutrients. They enable the plant to survive periods of adverse conditions or to survive between growing seasons and provide nutrients to support the growth of new plants as seedlings or shoots. It has also been shown that tuber storage proteins exhibit biological activities that could contribute to resistance to pests, pathogens, or abiotic stresses (1Shewry P. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2003; 91: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For example, patatin exhibits activity as an acylhydrolase and esterase (5Racusen D. Can. J. Bot. 1984; 62: 1641-1644Crossref Google Scholar); sporamin acts as a trypsin inhibitor (6Yeh K.W. Chen J.C. Lin M.I. Chen Y.M. Lin C.I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and dioscorin has antioxidative properties (7Hou W.C. Lee M.H. Chen H.J. Liang W.L. Han C.H. Liu Y.W. Lin Y.H. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 4956-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is therefore probable that storage proteins play a dual role in storage and defense. Plant tubers are known to contain other defense-related proteins such as chitinase and lectins. Chitinase, which acts as fungicide and insecticide, exists in the yam tubers of Dioscorea japonica (8Araki T. Funatsu J. Kuramoto M. Konno H. Torikata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19944-19947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Araki T. Kuramoto M. Torikata T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 430-434Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but the function of lectins in yam tubers has not yet been established. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that are widespread in the biosphere and occur in almost every living organism. The defensive role of plant lectins, such as anti-insect, anti-fungal, anti-microbial, as well as being toxic to birds and mammals, has been proposed on the basis of indirect and direct evidence (10Peumans W.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). A rich source of lectins are the plants, in particular their storage organs such as seeds, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, and bark, for example. Because many of the plants have been utilized as food resources by human beings, lectins are one of the most important physiologically active ingredients and potent exogenous biological signals in the diet (11Pusztai A. Bardocz S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 149-165Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the present work we isolated and characterized tuber proteins from the tubers of a typical Japanese yam, Dioscorea batatas, and we demonstrated for the first time that mannose- and maltose-binding lectins are present as major proteins in the yam. Moreover, dioscorin-like storage protein itself proved to be a maltose-binding lectin, which could not be classified into any known plant lectin family. Materials—The tubers of D. batatas were harvested in May at the Aomori prefecture, Japan, and were stored at 4 °C until used. For isolation of the proteins, whole tubers were used. Pyroglutamate aminopeptidase, endoproteinase Lys-C, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were purchased from Wako Chemical (Osaka, Japan). Chicken egg white lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17), bovine pancreatic trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4), carbonic anhydrase from bovine erythrocytes (EC 4.2.1.1), and α-amylase from Bacillus spp. (EC 3.2.1.1) were from Sigma. Dimethyl suberimidate and dimethyl adipimidate were from Nakalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). β-Amylase was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents were the highest grade commercially available. Purification of Tuber Proteins—Tubers (500 g) were homogenized in an equal volume (v/w) of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 6 m NaOH. Ammonium sulfate was added to 25% saturation with stirring. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant was subjected to hydrophobic chromatography on a phenyl-Toyopearl 650M column (3.5 × 20 cm) (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing ammonium sulfate to give 25% saturation. Elution was performed by a decrease of ammonium sulfate concentration from 25 to 0% in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). The fractions yielding absorbance at 280 nm were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and subjected to an anion-exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q HP column (5 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Fractionation of proteins was performed by a linear salt gradient (0–0.3 m) NaCl in equilibrium buffer. Gel filtration of purified proteins was performed on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (1.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl or a TSKgel 3000G SW column (0.75 × 30 cm, Tosoh) equilibrated with 0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Chemical Cross-linking and Gel Electrophoresis—The purified proteins (0.1 mg) were dissolved in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m triethanolamine (pH 8.0), reacted with 1 mg of dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) 1The abbreviations used are: DMS, dimethyl suberimidate; BAEE, Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester; DB, Dioscorea batatas; DMA, dimethyl adipimidate; GNA, Galanthus nivalis lectin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. and dimethyl adipimidate (DMA) homobifunctional cross-linkers for 1 h at 20 °C, and stopped by adding 20 μl of 0.2 m ammonium acetate. Cross-linked proteins were precipitated by ice-cold acetone and subjected to SDS-PAGE by using 12% (w/v) acrylamide gel as described by Laemmli (12Laemmli U. Nature. 1976; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Native PAGE was performed according to the Davis system (13Davis B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15961) Google Scholar). For glycoprotein detection proteins were stained using periodic acid-Schiff staining (14Devine P. Warren J. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 492-495PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated by the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Mass Spectrometry—Molecular masses were measured by a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE STR, Applied Biosystems) equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm; 4 ns) and delayed extraction unit. Aqueous solutions of protein samples (1 mg/ml) were diluted 1:1 in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing sinapinic acid (1 mg/ml) matrix. One microliter of the mixture was deposited on the target and air-dried. The MALDI-TOF spectrometer was run in linear mode with an acceleration voltage of 25 kV. Mass spectra were obtained as averages of 100 laser shots, and several independent MALDI-TOF mass measurements were made for each sample to evaluate reproducibility. Insulin (Mr 5,733.5) (bovine pancreas, Sigma) and myoglobin (Mr 16,949.5) (horse heart, Sigma) were used for external calibration. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were measured at room temperature using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) in the range of 210–260 nm with a 0.5-cm path length. Protein solutions were prepared at 0.1% (w/v) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing various concentrations of urea and were left for 2 h at room temperature before measurements. Amino Acid Sequencing—Each purified protein was reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.6) containing 10 mm EDTA and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride at 37 °C for 2 h, and reacted with 20 mm iodoacetamide for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. Excess reagent was removed by dialysis against distilled water and lyophilized. Reduced and carboxamidomethylated (CAM) proteins were directly applied to N-terminal sequencing on a protein sequencer (PPSQ-10, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Proteins having blocked N termini were further digested with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Trans-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by the method of Lauriere (15Lauriere M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250. The protein bands were cut out, destained, and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. CAM-DB3 subunits were digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Wako) (substrate/enzyme, 100:1), endoproteinase Arg-C (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) (substrate/enzyme, 100:1), endoproteinase Asp-N (Takara) (substrate/enzyme, 250:1), or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Wako) (substrate/enzyme, 50:1) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Each digest was separated by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography on a TSKgel ODS 120T column (4.6 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient increase of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The positions of the disulfide bonds in DB3 subunits were identified by analyzing the peptide fragments, which were derived from unmodified proteins upon cyanogen bromide cleavage in 70% formic acid and isolated by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequences of isolated peptide fragments were determined by the combined use of a protein sequencer, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, and an amino acid analyzer as described previously (16Tateno H. Saneyoshi A. Ogawa T. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Saneyoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19190-19197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Homologous sequences were searched by the FASTA program accessed by Genome Net. cDNA Sequencing of DB3—Oligonucleotide primers (DB3F/DB3R) specific to each subunit were designed based on the amino acid sequence of DB3 to amplify cDNA fragments of the lectin by means of RT-PCR as follows (F and R indicate sense (forward) and antisense (reverse) primers, respectively): DB3F, 5′-TGGAARACNTGYGGNAAYGGNATGGARCA-3′; DB3R, 5′-GCRTTRTTDATNGCRTTYTCRTT-3′. Total RNA was extracted using Concert Plant RNA Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was purified with a Micro-FastTrack mRNA Isolation kit (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed with oligo(dT) primer using Access Quick RT-PCR System (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR was done with a combination of DB3F and DB3R primers and first strand cDNA as template on PCR Express™. DNA was denatured at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by three step cycles (35 cycles) as follows: 95 °C for 0.5 min, 45 °C for 0.5 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and further extended at 72 °C for 5 min. Amplified DNA and fragment (0.8 kbp) generated by PCR with DB3F/DB3R-specific primers was subcloned into the pCR-Blunt II TOPO vector (Invitrogen). To obtain the full sequence of cDNAs, the flanking regions of cDNA encoding DB3 were obtained by the 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods using the Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). DNA was sequenced on an Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer (model 377) by cycle sequencing using T7, SP6, and M13 forward (–20) primers and the DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hemagglutination and Inhibition Assays—Hemagglutination assays were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates in a final volume of 100 μl containing 50 μl of serially diluted lectin solution and 50 μl of 2% fresh suspension of rabbit erythrocytes. Agglutination was assessed visually after 30 min at room temperature. Carbohydrate-binding specificity was determined by inhibition of agglutination of rabbit erythrocytes. Stock solutions of the inhibitors (25 μl) were diluted 2-fold in 96-well microtiter plates, followed by addition of 25 μl of lectin solutions. After 30 min of incubation, the erythrocyte suspension (50 μl) was added to the mixture and incubated for 30 min. The inhibitory activities were estimated by the minimum concentration of inhibitor needed to cause negative hemagglutination. To test the dependence of hemagglutination on divalent cations, lectins were kept in 0.1 m EDTA for 15 min at room temperature and then dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl overnight at 4 °C. The lectin solution was tested for hemagglutination activity in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ ions in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m NaCl. Enzymatic Activity Measurements—Chitinase activity was determined according to Hou et al. (17Hou W.C. Chen Y.C. Lin Y.H. Bot. Bull. Acad. Sin. (Taipel). 1998; 39: 93-97Google Scholar) using 0.05% deacetylated glycol chitin (G-7753, Sigma) as a substrate. The increased reducing ends were determined by the method of Imoto and Yagishita (18Imoto T. Yagishita K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1971; 35: 1154-1156Crossref Scopus (768) Google Scholar). One unit of chitinase activity was defined as an amount of enzyme capable of releasing reducing ends corresponding to 1 μg of GlcNAc from deacetyl glycol chitin in 30 min at 20 °C. GlcNAc (5–100 μg) was used to plot the standard curve. The chitinase activity of tuber proteins was compared with that of lysozyme. Carbonic anhydrase activity was measured by the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl acetate resulting in an increase of absorbance at 348 nm (19Verpoorte J.A. Mehta S. Edsall J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4221-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of tuber proteins was compared with that of carbonic anhydrase from bovine erythrocytes. Proteinase inhibitory activity was determined on bovine trypsin at 25 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2), containing 20 mm CaCl2 with Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester as substrate (100 μg/ml). After pre-incubation for 10 min, enzyme/inhibitor mixtures (20 μl) were added to a solution containing substrate in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2), containing 20 mm CaCl2 to give a final volume of 1 ml. The substrate hydrolysis was monitored by measuring absorbance at 253 nm. The trypsin inhibitory activity of tuber proteins was compared with that of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Wako). Amylase activity was assayed according to the method of Bernfeld (20Bernfeld P. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (3497) Google Scholar) using potato amylose (Sigma) (5 mg/ml) as substrate in a 16 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8) for β-amylase or 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.9) containing 6.7 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 for α-amylase. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1 mg of maltose in 3 min at 25 °C. The amylase activities of tuber proteins was compared with that of α-amylase from Bacillus spp. and β-amylase from soybean. Purification and Subunit Structures of Tuber Proteins—Extraction of yam tubers followed by phenyl-Toyopearl 650M chromatography (result not shown) yielded 2.0 g of crude protein from 1 kg of fresh tubers (87% yield) (Table I). The protein fraction, subjected to HiTrap Q HP chromatography gave four major peaks, designated DB1, DB2, DB3, and DB4 (Fig. 1). The yield of the fractions was 0.22, 0.60, 0.27, and 0.13 g, respectively. Approximate ratios of the yields are 20:50:20:10. None of the fractions was glycosylated. DB1, which was not retarded on the latter column, gave two bands corresponding to 20 and 10 kDa on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and a single band of 10 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 2). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed molecular masses of 11,784 for monomeric form and 23,428 Da for dimeric form (Fig. 3).Table IThe yields of D. batatas tuber proteinsPurification stepProteinRecoveryActivitygaValues were calculated per 1 kg of fresh tubers.%μg/mlbMinimum concentration required to agglutinate 2% rabbit erythrocytes.Homogenate2.3100Phenyl-Toyopearl 650M2.087HiTrap Q1.253DB10.222.7DB20.60NDcND, not detected.DB30.273.9DB40.13NDa Values were calculated per 1 kg of fresh tubers.b Minimum concentration required to agglutinate 2% rabbit erythrocytes.c ND, not detected.

B, DB2. C, DB3. D, DB4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DB2 gave a single band of 31 kDa using nonreducing/reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The molecular mass was estimated to be 27,788 Da by mass spectrometry, showing a multimeric form (Fig. 3). Gel filtration chromatography showed that DB2 existed as an aggregated form (result not shown). DB3 yielded two bands of 31 and 66 kDa under nonreducing conditions, and a single band of 31 kDa on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 2), indicating that the band of 66 kDa was composed of 31-kDa subunits cross-linked by disulfide bonds. DB3 migrated as a single band in native PAGE (data not shown) and eluted as a single peak at 120 kDa by gel filtration on HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 or TSKgel 3000G SW. DB3 dissociated into 66-(DB3L) and 31-kDa (DB3S) components by gel filtration in the presence of 8 m urea (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that DB3 was composed of one 66-kDa subunit and two 31-kDa subunits. The subunit structure of DB3 was confirmed by the combined use of chemical cross-linking of subunits and SDS-PAGE. DB3 cross-linked by either DMS or DMA yielded a band of 120 kDa (Fig. 4). The chemical cross-linking of DB3S gave a band of 66 kDa (Fig. 4), suggesting that the subunit formed a noncovalently bound dimer even after dissociating from DB3. Furthermore, DB3 showed a peak at m/z 111,291 as well as a peak corresponding to m/z 27,648 (Fig. 3). No sugars were detected in DB3 either by Schiff staining or the 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4′-azobenzenesulfonyl-hydrazide method (21Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that DB3 was not a glycoprotein. DB4 gave a single band of 28 kDa on SDS-PAGE under nonreduced conditions and 31 kDa under reduced conditions (Fig. 2). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showed the peak at m/z 55,536 corresponding to a dimer together with the peak at m/z 27,730 corresponding to a monomer (Fig. 3). CD Spectral Analysis—DB2 and DB3 showed characteristic far-UV CD spectra. Although both DB2 and DB3 showed high α-helix contents, the β-structure contents were quite different with 55% for DB2 and 9% for DB3. By increasing urea concentrations from 0 to 8 m, the spectral changes of DB3 were much larger than those of DB2 in the lower concentration range (Fig. 5). N-terminal Sequence of DB1—N-terminal amino acid sequences of yam tuber proteins were analyzed by Edman degradation on a gas-phase protein sequencer. DB1 was electro-blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and 10- and 20-kDa protein bands were subjected to a protein sequencer for N-terminal sequencing. The first 24 amino acid residues of both proteins identified are as follows: Asp-Phe-Ile-Leu-Tyr-Ser-Gly-Glu-Ser-Leu-Arg-Ser-Gly-Gln-Ala-Leu-Thr-Arg-Gly-Ser-Tyr-Thr-Phe-Ile, which was homologous to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of mannose-binding lectin, named GNA, from Galanthus nivalis (22Van Damme E. Kaku H. Goldstein I. Peeters B. Yagi F. Decock B. Peumans W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (58% sequence identity). Amino Acid Sequence of DB3—The 66-kDa subunit (DB3L) and the 31-kDa subunit of DB3 (DB3S) were reduced, S-carboxamidomethylated, and subjected to N-terminal sequencing (Fig. 6). The N-terminal sequence of DB3S was the same as that of DB2 (Fig. 6B). The total amino acid sequences of DB3L and DB3S were determined by both Edman degradation and cDNA sequencing as summarized in Fig. 6. The amino acid sequences of proteins were determined by analysis of peptides generated by digestion of CAM proteins with various proteases. DB3S was composed of 241 amino acid residues with a molecular mass calculated to be 27,599 Da, which is in good agreement with the value (27,611 Da) obtained from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The nucleotide sequence was analyzed by using a method of rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The cDNA of DB3S included 962 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 804 nucleotides encoding for a mature protein of 246 amino acid residues and a signal sequence of 22 residues. The stop codon at nucleotide position 805 was followed by a polyadenylation signal AATAAA, starting at position 905 (Fig. 6B). It should be noted that the C-terminal amino acid sequence, Lys-Val-Cys-Ala-Ile, which was deduced from the cDNA sequence, could not be detected in any digest prepared with various proteases. CAM-DB3L was composed of 242 amino acid residues with three half-cysteine residues. The molecular masses of DB3L before and after S-carboxamidomethylation were calculated to be 55,379 and 27,689 Da, respectively, which are in agreement with the values, 55,879 and 27,852 Da, respectively, obtained from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The cDNA of DB3L included 964 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 816 nucleotides encoding for a mature protein of 247 amino acid residues and a signal sequence of 25 residues (Fig. 6A). The stop codon at nucleotide position 817 was followed by a polyadenylation signal AATAAA, starting at position 917. As in the case of DB3S, the C-terminal amino acid sequence, Asn-His-Asp-Ala-Ile, which was deduced from the cDNA sequence, was lacking when the protein fragments were sequenced. Amino Acid Sequence of DB2—DB2 was subjected to amino acid sequencing as described for DB3. The amino acid sequence of DB2 was identical with that of DB3S. N-terminal amino acid sequences of DB2 and DB3 were highly homologous to the amino acid sequences deduced from the dioscorin cDNAs of Dioscorea cayenensis (23Conlan S. Griffits L. Napier J. Shewry P. Mantell S. Ainsworth C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Conlan S. Griffits L. Turner M. Fido R. Tatham A. Ainsworth C. Shewry P. J.

DB2 and DB3S were classified to be dioscorin A (93% identity), and DB3L was dioscorin B (90% identity). Localization of Disulfide Bonds of DB3—The amino acid sequences of DB3S and DB3L included two and three half-cysteine residues, respectively. Free cysteine residue could not be detected in either of the proteins. DB3L gave two fragments (C1 and C2) containing disulfide bonds upon cyanogen bromide cleavage. The Edman degradation of C2 yielded two amino acid sequences corresponding to Asp1–Met32 and Gly181–Met210. The result indicates that Cys28 and Cys188 formed an intrachain disulfide bond. The amino acid composition and the molecular mass of C2 supported the localization, m/z 6,673 (calculated as 6,687). On the other hand, C1 yielded a single sequence corresponding to Glu33–Met72. However, the molecular mass was measured to be m/z 9,080, which was double that of the calculated value (4,545) for the sequence, allowing us to locate one interchain disulfide bond at Cys40–Cys40′. N-terminal Amino Acid Sequence of DB4 —The N-terminal sequence analysis of DB4 yielded no N-terminal amino acids, indicating that the N terminus of this protein was blocked. Therefore, the protein was treated with pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase and subjected to sequencing. The N-terminal sequence was identified as follows: Asn-Cys-Gln-Cys-Asp-Thr-Thr-Ile-Thr-Cys-Cys-Ser-Gln-His-Gly-Tyr-Cys-Gly-Asn-Ser-Tyr-Asp-Tyr-Cys-Gly-Pro-, revealing that DB4 was highly homologous"

To date, three mammalian Fat cadherins have been described; however, only limited information is known about the function of these molecules. In this paper, we describe the second fat cadherin in Drosophila, fat-like (ftl). We show that ftl is the true orthologue of vertebrate fat-like genes, whereas the previously characterized tumor suppressor cadherin, fat, is more distantly related as compared with ftl. Ftl is a large molecule of 4705 amino acids. It is expressed apically in luminal tissues such as trachea, salivary glands, proventriculus, and hindgut. Silencing of ftl results in the collapse of tracheal epithelia giving rise to breaks, deletions, and sac-like structures. Other tubular organs such as proventriculus, salivary glands, and hindgut are also malformed or missing. These data suggest that Ftl is required for morphogenesis and maintenance of tubular structures of ectodermal origin and underline its similarity in function to a reported lethal mouse knock-out of fat1 where glomerular epithelial processes collapse. Based on our results, we propose a model where Ftl acts as a spacer to keep tubular epithelia apart rather than the previously described adhesive properties of the cadherin superfamily.

https://openalex.org/W2029682546,"Recent strategies to sensitize radioresistant tumours are based on combining gamma-irradiation with inducers of apoptosis. We report that the combination of three inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism, DL-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol.HCl(DL-PDMP)+imipramine +/- D-erythro-2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol (D-MAPP), with 10-Gy irradiation triggers both mitotic and apoptotic killing in radioresistant SQ20B squamous carcinoma cells. In these cells, apoptosis is defective due to a lack of ceramide generation upstream, which cannot be explained by sphingomyelinase (neutral and acidic) deficiency or rapid derivation to the sphingolipid pathway. We present evidence of a functional transduction death pathway when ceramide generation is restored, which involves the mitochondrial-mediated pathway coupled to alterations in redox status and to executive caspases activation. The poly-drug treatment restored apoptosis to levels similar to those observed in radiosensitive SCC61 squamous carcinoma cells. Simultaneous exposure to gamma-irradiation and poly-drug treatment acted synergistically in SQ20B cells to produce a marked increase in both mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase cleavage, which led to a 7.8-fold increase in apoptosis within 48 h, relative to irradiated cells. Moreover, the results suggest that the ceramide released by irradiation or poly-drug treatment converges upon common cellular targets. Modulation of endogenous ceramide levels by inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism may represent a new cellular target for the sensitization of radioresistant tumours to gamma-ray therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2005965515,"Post-translational maturation of cytochromes c involves the covalent attachment of heme to the Cys-Xxx-Xxx-Cys-His motif of the apo-cytochrome. For this process, the two cysteines of the motif must be in the reduced state. In bacteria, this is achieved by dedicated, membrane-bound thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases with a high reducing power, which are essential components of cytochrome c maturation systems and are also linked to cellular disulfide-bond formation machineries. Here we report high-resolution structures of oxidized and reduced states of a soluble, functional domain of one such oxidoreductase, ResA, from Bacillus subtilis. The structures elucidate the structural basis of the protein's high reducing power and reveal the largest redox-coupled conformational changes observed to date in any thioredoxin-like protein. These redox-coupled changes alter the protein surface and illustrate how the redox state of ResA predetermines to which substrate it binds. Furthermore, a polar cavity, present only in the reduced state, may confer specificity to recognize apo-cytochrome c.

Perhaps the best known are the mono-heme proteins that shuttle electrons between respiratory membrane-bound, proton-translocating protein complexes, i.e. from the cytochrome bc1 complex to cytochrome c oxidase. Many bacteria contain multi-heme c-type cytochromes in which the hemes have electron transfer and catalytic activities, e.g. cytochrome c nitrite reductase (2Einsle O. Messerschmidt A. Stach P.

Largely on the basis of genetic information, three markedly different CCM systems have been identified. Systems I and II occur predominantly in bacteria, whereas system III is found exclusively in eukaryotes (1Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem.

Reduction of the cysteinyls of the Cys-Xxx-Xxx-Cys-His motif prior to heme insertion is accomplished by CcmG and CcmH, but it is not clear whether the electrons flow from CcmG by means of CcmH, or from CcmH via CcmG, to the apo-cytochrome (27Fabianek R.A.

In addition to these CCM-specific proteins, DsbA, which catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds in the periplasm, and DsbB, which releases the electrons obtained from DsbA to the respiratory system by means of the quinol pool, have been reported to be important for formation of a disulfide bond in the apo-cytochrome prior to CCM (29Bardwell J.C.

Finally, DsbD (DipZ), an integral membrane protein that utilizes three distinct domains to transfer electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxins to the periplasm, supplies CcmGH with the necessary electrons for apo-cytochrome reduction (34Crooke H.

Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Remarkably, however, system II seems to comprise just three, rather than eight or nine, CCM-specific proteins (19Le Brun N.E. Bengtsson J. Hederstedt L. Mol.

The type II system of Bacillus subtilis (Fig. 1B) comprises the ResA, ResB, and ResC proteins (19Le Brun N.E. Bengtsson J. Hederstedt L. Mol.

The function of ResB and ResC has not been studied on a molecular level but may lie in heme delivery and/or ligation to the apo-cytochrome. ResC contains a tryptophan-rich sequence motif, also found in system I CcmE and CcmF, thought to be involved in heme binding (18Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol.

ResA is a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase with a very low midpoint redox potential (-340 mV at pH 7) that is tethered to the membrane via a single transmembrane helix (39Erlendsson L.S. Acheson R.M. Hederstedt L. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17852-17858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is thought to reduce the disulfide bond of the Cys-Xxx-Xxx-Cys-His motif of the apo-cytochrome. The necessary electrons to do this are probably delivered by the integral membrane protein CcdA, a relative of DsbD (18Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 39Erlendsson L.S. Acheson R.M. Hederstedt L. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol.

Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1423-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The role of CcdA in apo-cytochrome disulfide reduction is supported by the fact that inactivating mutations in bdbC and bdbD, which encode orthologs of the E. coli DsbB and DsbA proteins, can complement the cytochrome c-deficient phenotype of a CcdA-inactivated mutant (43Erlendsson L.S. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1423-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).The apparent simplicity of the Bacillus (type II) system in relation to that of E. coli (type I) makes it an attractive system for study. It also raises questions as to whether system II is indeed simpler than system I, whether each system II protein may combine functions of several system I proteins in one, and whether different pathways or underlying chemical principles may occur in the two CCM systems. To begin to address these issues, the three-dimensional structure of the enzymatic domain of ResA has been elucidated in its two biologically relevant redox states. These structures explain the molecular basis of the low redox potential that is fundamental to its function in reducing apo-cytochrome c. Moreover, the observed conformational differences in the two structures suggest a mechanism whereby the redox state of ResA might predetermine which substrate, apo-cytochrome c or CcdA, it binds. This selective substrate recognition may be a general feature of CCM-specific disulfide bond reduction systems.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSeleno-l-methionine Labeling of Soluble and His-tagged Soluble ResA—Histidine-tagged and wild-type soluble domain constructs of ResA were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (39Erlendsson L.S. Acheson R.M. Hederstedt L. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17852-17858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For over-expression and production of seleno-methionine-containing ResA, the E. coli selenium auxotroph strain B834(DE3) was transformed with plasmids pRAN8 (encoding His-tagged soluble ResA (htsResA)) or pRAN11 (encoding soluble ResA (sResA)) according to standard procedures (44Sambrook J. Fritsch F.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The B834 strain cells were initially grown on M9 minimal media, supplemented with 50 μg/ml methionine, at 37 °C. When the cells reached an A600 = 1.0, the culture was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 1 liter of M9 minimal media without methionine, incubated at 37 °C, and centrifuged at 200 rpm. After 6 h, seleno-l-methionine was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml and the culture was incubated at 37 °C and centrifuged at 200 rpm for 30 min. Over-expression of ResA was then induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and the culture was incubated at 37 °C and centrifuged at 200 rpm for a further 10 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The incorporation of seleno-methionine was verified by electro-spray mass spectrometry. Labeled htsResA was purified as described previously for the unlabelled proteins (39Erlendsson L.S. Acheson R.M. Hederstedt L. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17852-17858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—As ResA was isolated as a mixture of 70% oxidized and 30% reduced states (39Erlendsson L.S. Acheson R.M. Hederstedt L. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17852-17858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), complete oxidation of samples prior to crystallization was carried out by incubation in 10 mm diamide for 3 h at 277 K in the dark. Excess diamide was removed by using a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column that was previously equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Samples were subsequently concentrated to 12 mg/ml in 20 mm Na+/K+ phosphate, pH 7.0, and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 277 K. Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of oxidized htsResA and sResA grew in approximately 2 weeks at 277 and 289 K from 24-27% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6-5.9. The optimal crystallization conditions for both protein forms were identical, and the resulting crystals were indistinguishable, although crystals of the His-tagged protein were not as reproducible. Two distinct crystal forms were obtained for both His-tagged and non-tagged proteins. The first type of crystals grew as extruded hexagonal needles that belonged to space group P65 with cell dimensions a = b = 36.6 Å, c = 176.9 Å with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The second crystal form also exhibited morphology strongly indicative of the underlying hexagonal symmetry. These bipyramidal hexagonal crystals belonged to space group P65 with cell dimensions a = b = 61.0 Å, c = 165.4 Å, with two monomers per asymmetric unit. Crystals of reduced ResA were obtained from similar conditions as the oxidized form with the addition of 10-40 mm dithiothreitol. These crystals grew in 2-3 days and belonged to space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 47.5, b = 59.7, c = 110.1 Å. All ResA crystals could be frozen successfully in a solution containing 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 30% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m tri-sodium citrate, pH 5.6. The cryoprotectant solution of reduced crystals was supplemented with 40 mm dithiothreitol.Native data sets of the first, needle-like crystals of both htsResA and sResA were collected at 1.8 Å resolution at beam line XRD1 at Sincrotrone Trieste, Trieste, Italy. Data sets of the second type of oxidized ResA and of reduced ResA crystals were collected at 1.50 and 1.95 Å resolution, respectively, at BM14 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. A multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data set was collected at 2.37 Å resolution of seleno-methionine ResA crystals at the Protein Structure Factory, Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung mbH, Berlin, Germany. All data sets were processed and reduced with the HKL package (45Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38349) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of untagged, oxidized ResA was determined by MAD using the anomalous signal of five incorporated selenium atoms per ResA molecule. Identification of the 10 Se atom substructure and subsequent phasing was carried out with SOLVE (46Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The obtained phases were of excellent quality (FOM = 0.82), which allowed for 87% of all amino acids in the asymmetric unit to be built automatically by RESOLVE (47Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 48Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The model was completed using alternating rounds of manual model building using O (49Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar) and automated refinement using programs of the CCP4 suite (50Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

As refinement of the protein model approached completion, refinement was continued using a 1.5 Å resolution native data set, and phases were calculated from the model. Water molecules were incorporated using ARP (52Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, in the latter stages of refinement, the model was further improved by applying individual atomic anisotropic B-factor refinement using REFMAC (53Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta. Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar).Throughout refinement, progress was monitored with the aid of an Rfree value calculated with 5% of the data (54Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar). Upon completion of the model (Rfree = 12.3%, Rwork = 15.0%), a final round of refinement using all of the data was used to give a single crystallographic R factor (Rcryst = 12.25%). The final model comprises 2 monomers of ResA (residues 37-173 and 39-173), 434 molecules of water, and 4 molecules of ethylene glycol. Several residues also exhibit clearly defined alternate conformations.The structure of reduced ResA was determined by molecular replacement using the CCP4 version of AMORE (55Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The addition of 300 waters and a final round of correlation-based refinement using all of the data completed the model (Rfree = 21.0%, Rwork = 18.3%, Rcryst = 18.1%). The reduced structure incorporates residues 39-175 in the first monomer and 39-174 in the second. Both the oxidized and reduced structures exhibit excellent stereochemistry and geometry as judged with PROCHECK (58Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structure determination and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHigh-resolution Structures of Oxidized and Reduced ResA—The crystal structure of oxidized ResA was determined at 2.37 Å by the MAD method using the anomalous signal of five incorporated selenium atoms per monomer and subsequently refined at 1.5 Å (Rcryst = 12.25%, Rwork = 12.3%, Rfree = 15.0%). The crystals contain two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit of a hexagonal P65 cell. These molecules can be superimposed with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.63 Å.The overall structure of monomeric ResA contains a classical thioredoxin fold, comprising a mixed four-stranded β-sheet surrounded by three helices. ResA contains two additions to this motif, one N-terminal β-hairpin (residues 36-63), and one insertion (residues 104-127), which gives rise to an additional strand and helix between strand β2 and helix α3 (Fig. 2A). Similar additions to the thioredoxin fold have been described recently in the structures of Bradyrhizobium japonicum CcmG (59Edeling M.A. Guddat L.W. Fabianek R.A. Thöny-Meyer L. Martin J.L.

A, the protein exhibits a classical thioredoxin-like fold (blue) with two significant insertions: residues 37-63 contain a two-stranded, anti-parallel hairpin (green), whereas the central insert (residues 104-127, colored salmon) comprises one helix and one strand.

https://openalex.org/W2132983574,"The N-terminal NC4 domain of collagen IX is a globular structure projecting away from the surface of the cartilage collagen fibril. Several interactions have been suggested for this domain, reflecting its location and its characteristic high isoelectric point. In an attempt to characterize the NC4 domain in more detail, we set up a prokaryotic expression system to produce the domain. The purified 27.5-kDa product was analyzed for its glycosaminoglycan-binding potential by surface plasmon resonance and solid-state assays. The results show that the NC4 domain of collagen IX specifically binds heparin with a Kd of 0.6 μm, and the full-length recombinant collagen IX has an even stronger interaction with heparin, with an apparent Kd of 3.6 nm. The heparin-binding site of the NC4 domain was located in the extreme N terminus, containing a heparin-binding consensus sequence, whereas electron microscopy suggested the presence of at least three additional heparin-binding sites on full-length collagen IX. The NC4 domain was also shown to bind cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. This interaction and the association of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein with other regions of collagen IX were found to be heparin-competitive. Circular dichroism analyses of the NC4 domain indicated the presence of stabilizing disulfide bonds and a thermal denaturation point of about 80 °C. The pattern of disulfide bond formation within the NC4 domain was identified by tryptic peptide mass mapping of the NC4 in native and reduced states.

A similar pattern was demonstrated for the NC4 domain of full-length recombinant collagen IX. IntroductionCollagen IX is a heterotrimer of α1(IX), α2(IX), and α3(IX) polypeptide chains that fold into the triple helix characteristic of the members of the collagen family of extracellular matrix proteins (1van der Rest M. Mayne R. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1987: 195-221Google Scholar). This helix consists in the case of collagen IX of COL1, COL2, and COL3 domains, numbered from the carboxyl terminus, which are flanked by short noncollagenous segments, domains NC1–NC4. The domain NC4 is formed by the 245 extreme N-terminal amino acid residues of the α1(IX) chain, since a corresponding region is absent from the α2(IX) and α3(IX) polypeptides (2Mayne R. Brewton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 883-890Google Scholar).The function of collagen IX remains elusive. It is a minor component of the collagen fibrils of cartilage extracellular matrix and is also found in several other tissues. Collagen IX molecules are not present within the fibril body in cartilage but are instead associated with the surface of the collagen fibril and become covalently cross-linked to other collagen IX molecules and to collagen II, the main constituent of the fibril (2Mayne R. Brewton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 883-890Google Scholar, 3Eyre D. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 30-35Google Scholar). Collagen IX is not required for the assembly of the heterotypic collagen fibrils, but it is important for preservation of the long term stability of the cartilage extracellular matrix (4Olsen B.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 555-558Google Scholar, 5Aszódi A. Bateman J.F. Gustafsson E. Boot-Handford R. Fässler R. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 73-84Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism involved is not understood, however. The NC4 domain of collagen IX is seen in electron microscopy as a compact globulus projecting away from the fibril body, with the COL3 domain acting as a spacer arm (6Irwin M.H. Silvers S.H. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 814-823Google Scholar, 7Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Irwin M.H. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Google Scholar). This location and the high theoretical pI of the NC4 domain implicate collagen IX as a potential docking molecule, possibly connecting the host fibril to adjacent collagen fibrils or to other macromolecules of the extracellular matrix (8Vasios G. Nishimura I. Konomi H. van der Rest M. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2324-2329Google Scholar). Proteoglycans of the cartilage extracellular matrix may serve an intermediary purpose in these processes. A proteolytic fragment of collagen IX, lacking the NC4 domain and some other parts of the molecule, is indeed known to bind heparin with high affinity in vitro (9Munakata H. Takagaki K. Majima M. Endo M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1023-1027Google Scholar). The NC4 domain reportedly shows homology to the heparin-binding N-terminal domain of thrombospondin, but the residues believed to be crucial for heparin-binding potential of thrombospondin are not conserved in the NC4 domain (10Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 49-54Google Scholar). No research has yet been reported, however, on the glycosaminoglycan binding properties of the NC4 domain or full-length collagen IX.Studies in vitro have demonstrated that cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) 1The abbreviations used are: COMP, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; MED, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; rNC4, recombinant NC4 domain; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; DTT, dithiothreitol; SUV, small unilamellar vesicle; rcIX, recombinant collagen IX; rCOMP, recombinant COMP; COMP T3+TC, recombinant C-terminal fragment of a COMP monomer; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is able to bind collagen IX and collagen II with high affinity in a Zn2+-dependent fashion (11Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegård D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Google Scholar, 12Holden P. Meadows R.S. Chapman K.L. Grant M.E. Kadler K.E. Briggs M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6046-6055Google Scholar). The collagen IX molecule appears to possess four binding sites for the C-terminal globular domain of COMP, one at or near each NC domain of the protein (11Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegård D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Google Scholar, 12Holden P. Meadows R.S. Chapman K.L. Grant M.E. Kadler K.E. Briggs M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6046-6055Google Scholar). According to a recent report, another oligomeric protein of the cartilage matrix, matrilin-3, also binds to collagen IX and collagen II in a Zn2+-dependent fashion in vitro (13Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Google Scholar) and has been reported to interact with COMP in a manner that is inhibited by cations Zn2+ and Ca2+ (13Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Google Scholar). Although direct evidence is lacking, it seems possible that these in vitro interactions reflect the potential of collagen IX, COMP, and matrilin-3 for forming a macromolecular complex in a controlled fashion in vivo. Interestingly, mutations in these three proteins are known to cause a similar phenotype, multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, MED (13Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Google Scholar). This form of osteochondrodysplasia is a diverse disease both genetically and phenotypically and is typically manifested in irregular epiphyses of the long bones and in most cases early onset osteoarthritis. All mutations thus far characterized in the three genes encoding collagen IX result in an in-frame deletion of at least 12 amino acids from the COL3 domain of the respective component polypeptide. Despite this intriguing finding and the existence of detailed information on mutations found in the genes encoding COMP and matrilin-3, the molecular mechanism of the pathogenesis of MED is not yet properly understood (13Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Google Scholar).In the present work, we describe the production and characterization of the NC4 domain of human collagen IX as a recombinant protein and report on the interaction properties of this domain and its parental molecule with heparin and COMP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of the Bacterial Strain Expressing the Collagen α1(IX) NC4 Domain—To generate a DNA construct for expression of the NC4 domain of the human α1(IX) polypeptide, oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify the region corresponding to amino acids 24–268 of the full-length polypeptide (NCB accession number NP_001842), thereby omitting the 23-amino acid signal peptide (14Pihlajamaa T. Perälä M. Vuoristo M.M. Nokelainen M. Bodo M. Schulthess T. Vuorio E. Timpl R. Engel J. Ala-Kokko L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22464-22468Google Scholar). The 5′-primer (CGA TCC ATG GTC ATC GAA GGT CGA GCT GTC AAG CGT CGC) contained an engineered NcoI cleavage site, and the 3′-primer (GAC TGA ATT CTT ATC TCT CGT CGG TGG TCT G) contained an engineered EcoRI cleavage site. Since the respective domain of the avian α1(IX) chain had previously been produced as a C-terminal GST fusion protein (15Douglas S.P. Jenkins J.M. Kadler K.E. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 497-505Google Scholar), a similar expression strategy was chosen here. Consequently, the 5′-primer contained an additional sequence to generate a cleavage site for Factor Xa protease between the fusion partner and the NC4 domain. A previously characterized viral expression construct for the full-length collagen α1(IX) chain (14Pihlajamaa T. Perälä M. Vuoristo M.M. Nokelainen M. Bodo M. Schulthess T. Vuorio E. Timpl R. Engel J. Ala-Kokko L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22464-22468Google Scholar) was used as a template in PCR. The amplification product was digested with the enzymes indicated above and ligated into the pGAT-2 bacterial expression vector in-frame with the sequences for the GST fusion tag. Following transformation into TOP10 cells (Invitrogen), a positive clone pGAT2-NC23 was obtained and found to contain the correct nucleotide sequences. An additional clone pGAT2-NC1 with a mutation converting the Cys219 to an arginine residue was obtained. For expression of the fusion protein, the DNA constructs were transferred into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells.Expression and Purification of the NC4 Domain—The fusion protein was expressed in shaker flasks by inoculating an aliquot of the frozen cell line directly into the desired final volume of luria broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C until absorbance at 600 nm reached the value 1.0. The expression was started by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 4–6 h. Following centrifugation, the cell pellets were stored frozen and later homogenized on ice by sonication in 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), and 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the fusion protein was precipitated from the supernatant by adding ammonium sulfate to 30% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 23,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and dissolved in PBS supplemented with 1% IGEPAL-CA 630. The solution was clarified by centrifugation and incubated with a 1:20 volume of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS at 4 °C for 1 h. Following removal of the unbound material by centrifugation and three washing steps with PBS, the recombinant NC4 domain (rNC4) was cleaved off from the fusion partner by overnight digestion with Factor Xa protease (Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature. The insoluble fraction was then removed by centrifugation, and the rNC4 solution was diluted with 0.1 m NaCl and 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 8, and subjected to further purification using a Hi Trap Heparin affinity column and a Hi Trap SP cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), eluting with an increasing NaCl concentration gradient. The size and purity of the product were determined by both SDS-PAGE analysis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The identity of the purified protein was verified by amino acid analysis in an Applied Biosystems 421 analyzer and by analysis of the tryptic peptides by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The concentration of purified rNC4 was determined in a dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) calibrated by quantitative amino acid analysis of rNC4.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Collagen IX and COMP—Full-length collagen IX was prepared using a baculovirus expression vector system as described earlier (14Pihlajamaa T. Perälä M. Vuoristo M.M. Nokelainen M. Bodo M. Schulthess T. Vuorio E. Timpl R. Engel J. Ala-Kokko L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22464-22468Google Scholar). Full-length recombinant COMP and recombinant COMP T3+TC, containing residues 266–755 of COMP (Swiss Protein Database accession number P35444), were prepared as recently described (11Thur J.

Zaucke F. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 479-487Google Scholar).Circular Dichroism Analyses—CD spectra were measured using a JASCO J-810 instrument. Far-UV spectra were measured using a 0.1-cm path length cell for the 185–250-nm region, with a step size of 0.1 nm, scan speed of 20 nm/min, response of 0.25 s, bandwidth of 1 nm, and two accumulations per spectrum. The temperature was raised from 5 to 90 °C in steps of 5 °C and at a rate of 1 °C/min, allowing stabilization for 2 min before scanning. Lyophilized rNC4 was dissolved in water at a concentration of 10 μm. Measurements under reducing conditions were performed in water supplemented with 1 mm DTT. The temperature scan experiments were performed at the wavelength of 205 nm, raising the temperature from 10 to 90 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/min. Near-UV CD spectra were measured for 105 μm rNC4 in 1 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence or absence of a 10-fold molar excess of 17–19-kDa heparin (Sigma), using a 0.5-cm path length cell for the 250–320-nm region. Other parameters were as above.Preparation of Biotinylated Small Unilamellar Vesicles—Biotinylated small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) for the surface plasmon resonance studies were prepared by a method adapted from those described earlier (17Cooper M.A. Hansson A.

A solution of egg yolk l-α-phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) in chloroform/methanol (9:1) containing 2% biotinylated phosphatidylethanolamine (biotin DHPE; Molecular Probes Europe BV) was dried under a stream of nitrogen on a 37 °C water bath and lyophilized in a vacuum for 2 h. Multilamellar vesicles were obtained by quickly hydrating the dried mixture with HBS buffer (150 mm NaCl and 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4). The solution was subjected to probe sonication until the sample became clear (5 × 3 min on a cool water bath using a microtip probe), and the resulting SUV were purified by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The top third of the supernatant was collected and stored, protected from light, at 4 °C for use in the surface plasmon resonance studies.Surface Plasmon Resonance Assay—The surface plasmon resonance assays were performed on a Biacore 2000™ instrument using either streptavidin-coated SA or hydrophobic HPA sensor chips (Biacore AB), and kinetic parameters were determined with the manufacturer's BIAevaluation 3.02 software using both simultaneous and separate ka and kd rate constant measurements according to the Langmuir binding model. The hydrophobic surface of the HPA sensor chips was coated with biotinylated SUV as suggested by the manufacturer. The biotin-binding protein NeutrAvidin™ (Pierce), dissolved in HBS, was injected over the biotinylated lipid surface to obtain an active surface for binding biotinylated ligands.To study the interactions of the analytes with heparin surfaces, high molecular mass (17–19 kDa) heparin (Sigma) was biotinylated by incubation with an excess of N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce), followed by dialysis in water and lyophilization, and dissolved in HBS buffer. The biotinylated heparin was injected over the NeutrAvidin™ or streptavidin surface in a Biacore instrument, and the remaining binding sites were blocked by injecting dilute uncoupled biotin. One of the four flow paths in each sensor chip was left free of bound heparin to provide a negative control. Either rNC4 or recombinant human collagen IX (rcIX) produced in insect cells (14Pihlajamaa T. Perälä M. Vuoristo M.M. Nokelainen M. Bodo M. Schulthess T. Vuorio E. Timpl R. Engel J. Ala-Kokko L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22464-22468Google Scholar) was injected as the analyte at various concentrations at a flow rate of 10 or 25 μl/min for 2 or 5 min in HBS buffer. To study the specificity of interaction with heparin, a constant amount of analyte was preincubated with different amounts of heparin, chondroitin 6-sulfate, or dermatan sulfate (Sigma) prior to injection. The surfaces were regenerated after each injection cycle with repeated injections of a solution containing 0.61 m NaCl and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4.To study the interaction between NC4 and COMP, an aliquot of rNC4 was biotinylated at its carboxyl groups by incubation with a 10-fold molar excess of 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride solution and a 100-fold molar excess of biotin-PEO-amine (Pierce), followed by dialysis and lyophilization, and dissolved in HBS buffer containing 0.5 mm ZnCl2. Biotinylated rNC4 was attached to a biacore sensor chip in a similar fashion as above, but supplementing the HBS buffer with 0.5 mm ZnCl2 (19Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Google Scholar), and the interaction between COMP and rNC4 was studied by injecting various amounts of rCOMP (11Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegård D. Paulsson M. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6083-6092Google Scholar) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min with a 10-min contact time. The surface was regenerated after each cycle with three injections of a solution containing 0.61 m NaCl, 15 mm HEPES, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The kinetics of the interaction between rNC4 and COMP were determined by using COMP T3+TC (16Spitznagel L. Nitsche D.P. Paulsson M. Maurer P. Zaucke F. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 479-487Google Scholar), which was biotinylated by incubation with a 2-fold molar excess of biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) in 0.2 m NaHCO3, pH 8.2, followed by dialysis and lyophilization, and dissolved in HBS buffer containing 0.5 mm ZnCl2. Biotinylated COMP T3+TC was attached to the surface of a sensor chip as above, and rNC4 or rcIX was injected over the surface in the presence or absence of excess heparin at a flow rate of 40 μl/min with a 2-min contact time. After each cycle, the surface was regenerated with two injections of 10 mm EDTA in HBS.Solid-phase Heparin-binding Assays—For solid-state binding assays, rNC4 or rcIX at 1 μg/ml in PBS (0.137 m NaCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2.7 mm KCl) were coated onto 96-well plates (Maxi-Sorp™, Nunc, Denmark) overnight at 4 °C. Further binding was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Heparin-albumin-biotin (Sigma) at 5 μg/ml or biotinylated heparin (see above) at 36 μg/ml in PBS supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 was allowed to interact with rNC4 or collagen IX surface, respectively, in the absence or presence of a nonbiotinylated competitor. The levels of bound biotinylated reagents were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated NeutrAvidin™ using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Pierce) as substrate. The low background levels from wells coated with bovine serum albumin were subtracted from the experimental data.Electron Microscopy—Bovine serum albumin was coupled to high molecular weight heparin by incubating with a 20-fold molar excess of heparin and a 200-fold excess of 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride solution for 2 h at room temperature in 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 5.0. The obtained heparin-bovine serum albumin was purified by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences), dialyzed, conjugated with colloidal gold of 4 nm, and allowed to react with full-length collagen IX. Formed complexes were visualized by electron microscopy after negative staining with uranyl formate. Preparation of gold conjugates and electron microscopy were performed as described recently in detail (20Wiberg C. Klatt A.R. Wagener R. Paulsson M. Bateman J.F. Heinegård D. Mörgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37698-37704Google Scholar).Identification of the Heparin-binding Region of the NC4 Domain— The recombinant NC4 domain was reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Free iodoacetamide was reduced with 0.1 m DTT and removed by dialysis into 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. A 450-μg aliquot of the alkylated rNC4 was subjected to digestion with 12 units of V8 protease (Sigma) in the same buffer at room temperature for 4 h. The reaction mixture was diluted 4-fold with 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8, and part of the sample was passed through a heparin-Sepharose affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). Unbound material, the material eluted with 0.5 m NaCl, and the remaining digestion mixture were desalted with ZipTip reversed phase tips C4 and μC18 (Millipore Corp.) in tandem prior to analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. On the basis of the obtained results a peptide spanning amino acids 1–19 of the mature NC4 domain was synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistries in a 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems), purified, inspected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and analyzed for its heparin-binding potential by heparin affinity chromatography. The peptide, designated as peptide 1–19, was also analyzed by CD under similar conditions as rNC4.Using synthetic oligonucleotides and the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), a construct was prepared for expression of mutant rNC4 carrying a sequence NGL in place of the normal sequence KRR at positions 3–5 of the polypeptide. The mutant rNC4 was expressed as above, purified using glutathione-Sepharose and Factor Xa digestion, and subjected to heparin affinity chromatography.Analysis of Disulfide Bonding Pattern—In order to isolate the NC4 domain from full-length collagen molecules, rcIX was digested with collagenase (Sigma), the reaction mixture was passed through a heparin-Sepharose affinity column (Amersham Biosciences), and the bound material was eluted with an increasing salt gradient and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. This material and rNC4 were then subjected to trypsin digestion with or without prior reduction with DTT and alkylation with 4-vinylpyridine. For in-liquid digestion, both the native and alkylated material were subjected to reversed phase chromatography on a C1 column, and the proteins were collected and dried. Trypsin (sequencing grade modified trypsin; Promega) in 50 μl of 0.1 m (NH4)2HCO3 was added to the dried proteins to 5% (w/w), and digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 4 h. The digestion mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—Secondary structures of rNC4 and its mutated form were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Samples were exchanged to D2O and concentrated to about 20 mg/ml. Spectra were recorded at room temperature in IR cells having CaF2 windows and 15-μm Teflon spacers using a Bruker I55 spectrometer and a Hg/Cd/Te infrared detector. For each sample, 15 spectra of 64 scans were averaged, and the separately collected solution background absorption for each sample in the same cell assembly was subtracted from the final spectra. Gaussian curve fitting was used to determine the secondary structures.Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray ionization mass spectra of the expressed rNC4 were obtained using a Micromass Q-TOF quadrupole/time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass) calibrated using myoglobin as a standard. Protein masses were calculated by deconvulation in MassLynx 3.4 (Micromass).The NC4 peptides generated by either trypsin or V8 protease digestion were analyzed with a Biflex™ MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonics) in positive ion reflector mode (for peptides under 3500 Da) and positive ion linear mode (for peptides larger than 3500 Da) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. The MALDI spectra were externally calibrated with the standard peptides, angiotensin II and adrenocorticotropin 18–39 or insulin.RESULTSProduction of the Recombinant NC4 Domain of Human Collagen IX—To study the structure and interactions of the NC4 domain of human collagen IX, sequences encoding amino acids 24–268 of the human α1(IX) polypeptide were cloned into a prokaryotic expression vector for production as a C-terminal GST fusion protein lacking the native α1(IX) signal peptide. Following induction in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, the recombinant protein was isolated from the harvested cells and subjected to initial affinity purification by glutathione-Sepharose. The GST tag was removed enzymatically, and a solution containing the suspected recombinant NC4 domain was applied to a heparin-Sepharose affinity column at physiological pH and ionic strength. A protein with a size expected for the recombinant NC4 domain bound effectively to the column and began to elute in the presence of about 0.25 m NaCl. Further purification was obtained by cation exchange chromatography. The purified protein was identified as the NC4 domain by amino acid analysis and analysis of the tryptic peptides. The expected molecular mass of 27,446 Da was obtained for the protein, designated as rNC4, by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.Surface Plasmon Resonance and Solid-state Analyses of the Interaction of rNC4 with Heparin—In the surface plasmon resonance analyses carried out to study the heparin-binding properties of rNC4, high molecular weight heparin was biotinylated and used to coat surface plasmon resonance sensor chips. Injection of soluble rNC4 at physiological pH and ionic strength over the heparin surface demonstrated the ability of the NC4 domain to interact with the immobilized ligand (Fig. 1). A series of injections was used to determine the monomeric binding kinetics of the heparin interaction (Fig. 2A), resulting in the determination of the association and dissociation rate constants ka and kd and the equilibrium dissociation constant Kd (Table I). Using a hydrophobic sensor chip surface coated with biotinylated liposomes, a Kd of 0.6 μm was reliably obtained with low and regenerable background levels (Table I). Relatively low χ2 values indicate that the Langmuir 1:1 binding model provides a good approximation of the interaction strength (Fig. 2A). Use of a carboxymethylated dextran-based sensor chip with a streptavidin coating gave an approximate Kd of 3.2 μm but with accumulating background levels.Fig. 2Kinetics of the binding of rNC4 and rcIX to immobilized heparin, detected by surface plasmon resonance assay. Soluble analytes were injected over heparin-coated HPA sensor chip channels, and the bulk signals of the negative control channel lacking heparin were subtracted from the signals of the heparin channels. The experimental results are represented by the black curves. The gray curves show the calculated fits to the Langmuir 1:1 binding model. The χ2 values representing the S.E. of residuals of the fitting are shown next to each pair of curves. A, rNC4 was injected at concentrations of 2 μm (a), 3 μm (b), 4 μm (c), and 5 μm (d) using a 2-min contact time and a flow rate of 25 μl/min.

https://openalex.org/W2164970912,"Epidemiological data on prostate cancer incidence has suggested that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for prostate cancer. The antiproliferative activity of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-VD) and its analogues has been demonstrated in many prostate cancer models, yet the detailed mechanisms underlying this protective effect of vitamin D remain to be determined. Here, we demonstrate that two androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and CWR22R, are more sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of 1,25-VD compared to the AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and DU 145. 1,25-VD treatment inhibited cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) activity and induced G0/G1 arrest. Interestingly, we also found that 1,25-VD treatment induced the expression of AR, and that the onset of the G0/G1 arrest in LNCaP and CWR22R cells is correlated with the onset of increasing expression of AR. This implies that the antiproliferative actions of 1,25-VD in AR-positive prostate cancer might be mediated through AR. Furthermore, a reduction in 1,25-VD-mediated growth inhibition was observed when AR signaling was blocked by antiandrogens, AR RNA interference, or targeted disruption of AR. Taken together, our data suggest that the androgen/AR signaling plays an important role in the antiproliferative effects of 1,25-VD and restoration of androgen responsiveness by 1,25-VD might be beneficial for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2123063574,"N-Propionyl, N-butyryl (N-Bu), and N-benzoyl mannosamine, as precursors of sialic acid biosynthesis, were incubated with human melanoma SK-MEL-28 cells and resulted in the replacement of N-acetyl groups on the cell surface sialic acid residues, including those associated with GD3. Meanwhile, vaccines containing GD3 and modified GD3 tetrasaccharide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates were synthesized, and BALB/c mice were immunized with them together with monophosphoryl lipid A adjuvant. The GD3Bu-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate raised the highest IgG titers without any cross-reactivity to unmodified GD3. Expression of GD3Bu epitopes on the surface of SK-MEL-28 cells was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by the binding of a polyclonal antiserum and monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A, both of which specifically recognize GD3Bu, and by mass spectroscopic analysis of glycolipids extracted from cells. Following expression of GD3Bu on the surface of SK-MEL-28 cells, the cells could be lysed by mAb 2A and GD3Bu antiserum in the presence of complement. Although less effective in the control of existing large size tumors (∼10 mm inner diameter) on BALB/c nu/nu mice, mAb 2A in combination with ManNBu effectively protected mice from SK-MEL-28 tumor grafting. This approach may provide a method to augment the immunogenicity of sialylated human antigens and to avoid generating an autoimmune response to them at same time.

In this work we have extended the same strategy to another poorly immunogenic GD3 antigen. As a result of biochemically engineering the sialic acid residues of the GD3 on the surface of SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells, the neoantigen (modified GD3) formed on the cell surface serves as a target for cytolytic antibodies. Since the specific antibodies are not cross-reactive with unmodified GD3 on the cell surface, this approach, in principle, may enable us to turn on and turn off immune response to this neoantigen by adding or withdrawing N-acylmannosamine precursors during treatment. Consequently, this approach may avoid the risk of a possible autoimmune response (33Livingston P.O. Ragupathi G. Musselli C. J. Clin.

The mixture was adjusted to pH 7, incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min to remove insoluble material. CMP-Neu5Ac (25 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), and α-2,8-sialyltransferase (10 units) were added to the above solution. The mixture was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The resulting solution was lyophilized and further purified on a Bio-Gel P-6 column using 0.03 m NH4HCO3 as eluent to give GD3Ac tetrasaccharide (disialolactoside) (210 mg) and GM3 trisaccharide (sialolactoside) (45 mg).

After cooling, the solution was carefully neutralized by the addition of 2 n HCl and purified by passage through a Bio-Gel P-6 column, using 0.03 m NH4HCO3 as eluent. The product obtained after lyophilization was an amorphous solid in almost quantitative yield. N-Acylation of N-Deacetylated GD3 Tetrasaccharide—To a solution of N-deacetylated GD3 tetrasaccharide (5 mg) in 5% Na2CO3 (2.5 ml), propionic anhydride at room temperature (10 μl, three times with 10-min intervals) was added with vigorous stirring. After 30 min, the mixture was adjusted to pH 11.0 by the addition of 2 n NaOH and kept for 1 h. The solution was then adjusted to pH 8.0 by the addition of 0.5 n HCl. Purification on a Sephadex G-10 column using water as eluent afforded, after lyophilization, GD3Pr tetrasaccharide as an amorphous solid in almost quantitative yield. To a solution of N-deacetylated GD3 tetrasaccharide (5 mg) in a mixture of 5% Na2CO3 (2.5 ml) and diethyl ether (2.5 ml), butyric anhydride (30 μl) or benzoyl chloride (30 μl) at room temperature was added with vigorous stirring. After 30 min the organic layer was removed, and the aqueous solution was adjusted to pH 11.0 by the addition of 2 n NaOH and kept for 1 h. The solution was then adjusted to pH 8.0 by 0.5 n HCl and passed through a Sephadex G-10 column, using water as eluent. The respective products, GD3Bu and GD3Bz tetrasaccharides, were obtained after lyophilization as amorphous solids in almost quantitative yields. Reduction of Azido Group to Amine and Introduction of Maleimide—A solution of the above tetrasaccharides (5 mg each) in water (0.5 ml) was subjected to catalytic (Pd/C) hydrogenation (30 pounds/square inch) for 2 h, respectively. The filtrate was passed through a Sephadex G-10 column, using water as eluent. The lyophilized products (amines) were dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer (2 ml, pH 7.2) and mixed with N-(γ-maleimidobutyryloxy)sulfosuccinimide (5 mg each). The solution was kept at room temperature for 0.5 h, when TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/H2O 9:9:1) indicated the formation of a faster moving product. Purification was performed on a Sephadex G-10 column with water as eluent. Four maleimide-containing products were obtained as an amorphous solid after lyophilization in almost quantitative yields. Conjugation to KLH—A solution of thiolated KLH (37Jue R. Lambert J.M. Pierce L.R. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Ragupathi G. Koganty R.R.

The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 6 h. Purification on a Bio-Gel A-0.5 column (1.6 × 30 cm), eluted with PBS buffer (pH 7.1), gave the respective conjugates, GD3Ac-KLH, GD3Pr-KLH, GD3Bu-KLH, and GD3Bz-KLH, in a volume of about 6–7 ml. Sialic acid and protein contents were estimated using the resorcinol method (39Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar) and the BCA (Pierce) protein assay. Each KLH molecule carried about 300–460 GD3 tetrasaccharide chains (see Table II). The respective BSA conjugates containing 5–11 GD3 tetrasaccharides were prepared using the same procedure. Four groups of 10 BALB/c mice each (6–8 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with KLH glycoconjugates containing 2 μg of GD3Ac (GD3Pr, GD3Bu, and GD3Bz) and MPL (2 μg, Ribi Immunochem, Hamilton, MT), in 0.15 ml of PBS. Five mice were injected with 0.15 ml of PBS. The mice were boosted on days 7, 14, and 21 and bled on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 30. Serum samples for serological testing were stored at -20 °C. Serum samples were titered against BSA conjugates in 96-well plates (ICN Biomedicals Inc, Aurora, OH). Wells were coated overnight at 20 °C with 100 μl of BSA conjugates (5 μg/ml) in PBS per well. The wells were blocked by the addition of 100 μl of 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at 20 °C. The plates were washed three times with a washing solution of 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. Antisera serially diluted in 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS was added (100 μl per well) and incubated for 3 h at 20 °C. This was followed by washing three times as before followed by the addition of 100 μl per well of alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG or IgM (Caltag Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) diluted 1:2000 in 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS. The plates were incubated overnight at 20 °C and again washed three times. 100 μl of substrate solution containing p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (1 mg/ml, Kirkegaard & Perry lab, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to the wells. After 30 min at 20 °C, the plates were scanned at 405 nm in an EL 800 (Biotek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VE) microplate reader. The titer was defined as the highest dilution yielding an absorbance of ≥0.25. SK-MEL-28 and G361 human melanoma cells were cultured as adherent monolayers in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) as the standard medium. Cells were cultured under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For flow cytometry experiments, the cells were trypsinized with trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and suspended in PBS prior to the antiserum treatment. Cells were cultured in the presence of ManNAc, ManNPr, ManNBu, or ManNBz by the addition of the appropriate amount of the precursor to the culture medium. The SK-MEL-28 and G361 cells were pretreated in 24-well plates with ManNAc, ManNPr, ManNBu, and ManNBz at the concentrations of 1, 3, and 5 mg/ml. After treatment with precursor, the cells (1–2 × 105) were harvested at days 1, 2, 3, 6, and 10, washed three times with PBS, 1% fetal calf serum, and incubated on ice with polyclonal sera (from homologous vaccinated mice, see above) diluted in PBS or supernatant containing monoclonal antibodies (200 μl). After 60 min, the cells were washed and incubated with (R)-phycoerythrin goat antimouse IgG and/or with fluorescein isothiocyanate goat antimouse IgM (Cedarlane Laboratories, Ontario, Canada) in 100 μl of PBS, 1% fetal calf serum (1:500–1000). After another 60 min at 4 °C, the cells were washed three times with PBS, 1% fetal calf serum and fixed with PBS, 5% formaldehyde and assayed on a flow cytometer (Coulter Inc., Miami, FL, or FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). The gangliosides were extracted from SK-MEL-28 cells according to the method of Svennerholm and Fredman (40Svennerholm L. Fredman P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) with simplification. Briefly, precursor-treated and untreated cells (∼1.0 × 107) suspended in PBS were precipitated by centrifugation to pellets that were extracted twice with chloroform/methanol/water (4:8:3). The solvents were evaporated to residues, which were dissolved in methanol. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, and the compounds in methanol were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis-MS (CRYSTAL CE System, Thermo Bioanalysis). Murine mAbs to GD3Bu-KLH were prepared by standard methods according to Plested et al. (41Plested J.S. Makepeace K. Jennings M. Gidney M.A.J. Lacelle S. Brisson J.-R. Cox A.D. Martin A. Bird A.G. Tang C.M. Mackinnon F.M. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5417-5426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly the mice were immunized four times intraperitoneally, followed by one intravenous injection without adjuvant. Hybridomas were prepared by the fusion of spleen cells with Sp2/O-Ag 14 as described (42Kenett R.H. Denis K.A. Tung A.S. Klinman N.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1978; 81: 77-91PubMed Google Scholar). Putative hybridomas secreting GD3Bu-specific antibodies were selected by ELISA using synthetic GD3Bu-BSA as a coating antigen. Immunoglobulin class and subclass were also determined by ELISA. Two clones, mAbs 1 and 2A, were grown in BALB/c mice after treatment with pristane to generate ascitic fluid, which was purified through a protein A column (ImmunoPure Plus Immobilized Protein A IgG Purification Kit, Pierce). For inhibition studies, mAb 1 or 2A was incubated with synthetic GD3Ac, GD3Pr, GD3Bu, and GD3Bz (from 0.1 to 100 μg/ml) prior to addition to GD3Bu-BSA-coated plates and then assayed as described above. Three nude mice (CgFoxNude) were subcutaneously transplanted with 1 × 107 SK-MEL-28 cells/mouse. When the tumors were about 10 mm in width, ManNBu was injected intraperitoneally daily (5 mg/mouse) for 2 weeks (5 days/week). Cells from dissected tumors were analyzed by flow cytometry with mAb 2A and mAb R24 to detect the GD3Bu and GD3Ac expression, respectively. The assays were performed as described previously (27Kanazawa J. Ohta S. Shitara K. Fujita F. Fujita M. Hanai N. Akinaga S. Okabe M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2000; 49: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 43Dohi T. Nores G.A. Hakomori S.-I. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5680-5685PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, SK-MEL-28 and modified Bu-SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells (1 × 106 cells) were labeled with 3.7 MBq Na2 51CrO4 (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed twice with PBS. Samples of the labeled cells (50 μl) were added into 96-well microtiter plates (1 × 105 cells/well) and incubated with 100, 50, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 μg of mAb 2A in PBS (50 μl) or mouse serum (50 μl, 400-fold dilutions in PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C. Then 100 μl/well of 10% rabbit complement (Cedarlane) were added to wells and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation 51Cr release was counted in a 1450 Microbeta Trilux liquid scintillation and luminescence counter (Wallac, Helsinki, Finland). The percentage of specific lysis was calculated based on the experimental 51Cr release, the total release, and the spontaneous release. Approximately 1.0 × 107 SK-MEL-28 cells in 0.3 ml of RPMI medium were subcutaneously transplanted into the right flank of 10 BALB/c nu/nu mice. Tumors started to develop 4–5 weeks after transplantation, and mice were used when tumors were ∼10 mm in width. Five tumor-grafted nude mice were injected intraperitoneally with ManNBu in RPMI medium (5 mg/mouse) for 2 days prior to intraperitoneal injection of mAb 2A (200 μg/mouse) and ManNBu (5 mg/mouse) for 2 weeks (5 days/week). Another five mice in a control group received only intraperitoneal injection of mAb 2A (200 μg/mouse) for 2 weeks (5 days/week). The tumor size (volume) was calculated by the following formula: tumor size V (mm3) = 0.4 × (major axis) × (minor axis)2. Approximately 1.0 × 107 SK-MEL-28 cells in 0.3 ml of RPMI medium were subcutaneously transplanted into the right flank of 48 BALB/c nu/nu mice. Administration of mAb 2A and/or ManNBu was started 3 days later. Three groups of 10 mice each were injected subcutaneously with ManNBu (5 mg/mouse), mAb 2A (200 μg/mouse), or both ManNBu (5 mg/mouse) and mAb 2A (200 μg/mouse), respectively; 8 mice in another group were injected intraperitoneally with both ManNBu (5 mg/mouse) and mAb 2A (200 μg/mouse) for 2 weeks (5 days/week), using one group of 10 mice as control. Tumor incidence was observed within 30 days and was confirmed 45 days after tumor transplantation. Synthesis of GD3 Tetrasaccharide-KLH Glycoconjugates— Chemical syntheses of GD3 have been reported previously (44Nunomura S. Ogawa T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 5681-5684Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 45Ishida H. Ohta Y. Tsukada Y. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Carbohydr.

Demchenko A.V. Boons G.J. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 5490-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, large scale synthesis of the GD3 tetrasaccharide is still difficult to achieve. Recently, a bi-functional sialyltransferase from Campylobacter jejuni, which transfers sialic acid to both 3-O-Gal and 8-O-NeuAc, was cloned and expressed (35Gibert M. Brisson J.R. Karwaski M.F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wu Y. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3896-3906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We used this enzyme successfully for the synthesis of disialolactoside (GD3 tetrasaccharide) on a 200-mg scale. The main by-product was sialolactoside (GM3 trisaccharide), which was separated from disialolactoside by a Bio-Gel P-6 column eluted with 0.03 m NH4HCO3. Modified disialolactosides in which the N-acetyl groups of sialic acids were replaced by respective N-propionyl, N-butyryl, and N-benzoyl groups were derived in two steps, namely removal of N-Ac by base treatment and quantitative re-N-acylation with either propionyl and butyryl anhydride or benzoyl chloride. Consequently, four disialolactosides, GD3Ac, GD3Pr, GD3Bu, and GD3Bz tetrasaccharides, were obtained with a β-linked 3-azidopropyl spacer. The spectroscopic data of GD3Ac tetrasaccharide are listed in Table I. Catalytic reduction of the azido groups generated their respective amines quantitatively, which were subsequently converted to maleimide-containing disialolactosides as indicated by a singlet resonance at δH 6.8 ppm in their 1H NMR spectra. After reaction of the latter with thiolated KLH, four glycoconjugates, GD3Ac-KLH, GD3Pr-KLH, GD3Bu-KLH, and GD3Bz-KLH, were obtained (see Fig. 1). The ratios of disialolactoside to KLH were between 300 and 460 based on sialic acid analysis (39Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar) and protein assay (see Table II). By using the same procedures, four respective BSA conjugates were also prepared with 5–11 disialolactosides attached to each BSA molecule. Immunizations—BALB/c mice were immunized and boosted three times weekly with GD3Ac-KLH, GD3Pr-KLH, GD3Bu-KLH, and GD3Bz-KLH conjugates. Ten days after the last boost (day 31), whole serum was analyzed by ELISA using GD3Ac-BSA, GD3Pr-BSA, GD3Bu-BSA, and GD3Bz-BSA as coating antigens. The antibody levels, both for IgG and IgM, were determined (see Table III). All four conjugates gave high titers of antibodies. In addition, subtyping analysis revealed that a majority of the specific antibodies was IgG rather than IgM. The GD3Bu-KLH conjugate was the most immunogenic, followed by GD3Pr-KLH, GD3Ac-KLH, and GD3Bz-KLH. The extension of the N-acyl chain seemed to correlate with the increased immuno"
https://openalex.org/W2086822028,"Maspin has been demonstrated to be a suppressor of invasion and cell motility in vitro, whereas in vivo analyses have reported that increased expression of maspin is associated with malignant behavior. The present study examined maspin expression in normal lung and non-small-cell lung cancers. Only proximal airway cells in the normal lung expressed maspin, and the expression was associated with decreased methylation. This association was also observed in non-small-cell lung cancers, but the expression was quite different among histologic subtypes; 20 of 21 squamous cell carcinomas showed intense, uniform expression, whereas the expression status varied among adenocarcinomas. Of the 119 adenocarcinomas, 60 were negative, 23 positive and 36 showed a heterogeneous expression pattern. The expression was inversely correlated with markers of peripheral airway cells. Taken together, the results suggest that maspin may be expressed in association with the proximal airway cell type. It is of note that the heterogeneous expression pattern of maspin is quite distinctive, showing geographic positivity in the individual tumors. Separate analysis of methylation status in positive and negative portions of individual tumors provided an instance of intratumor diversity associated with promoter DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2092850029,"Several recent studies have revealed the existence of a conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex consisting of several novel proteins as well as known Golgi proteins that were identified by independent approaches. The mammalian COG complex contains eight subunits: COG1/LdlBp, COG2/LdlCp, COG3/Sec34, COG4/Cod1, COG5/GTC-90/Cod4, COG6/Cod2, COG7, and COG8/Dor1. COG1, COG2, and COG7 seem structurally unique to mammalian cells, whereas the other five subunits are structurally conserved in yeast, which also contains three other unique proteins (COG1/Sec36p/Cod3p, COG2/Sec35p, and COG7/Cod5p). We report here the network of intermolecular interactions of the COG complex, revealed by in vitro translation and co-immunoprecipitation approaches. Our results suggest that COG4 serves as a core component of the complex by interacting directly with COG1, COG2, COG5, and COG7. COG3 is incorporated by its direct interaction with COG1 and COG2, whereas COG6 and COG8 do not interact with any individual subunit. Incorporation of COG6 into the complex depends on the concerted interaction of both COG5 and COG7, whereas optimal incorporation of COG8 depends on the concerted interaction of COG5, COG6, and COG7. Because COG4 (together with COG1, COG2, and COG3) is among the four essential genes of the COG complex in yeast, this molecular network highlights the structural basis for a crucial role of COG4 in the assembly/function of the complex.

https://openalex.org/W1996767161,"The voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v)1.8 is only expressed in subsets of neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal and nodose ganglia. We have isolated mouse partial length Na(v)1.8 cDNA clones spanning the exon 17 sequence, which have 17 nucleotide substitutions and 12 predicted amino acid differences from the published sequence. The absence of a mutually exclusive alternative exon 17 was confirmed by sequencing 4.1 kilobases of genomic DNA spanning exons 16-18 of Scn10a. A novel cDNA isoform was identified, designated Na(v)1.8c, which results from alternative 3'-splice site selection at a CAG/CAG motif to exclude the codon for glutamine 1031 within the interdomain cytoplasmic loop IDII/III. The ratio of Na(v)1.8c (CAG-skipped) to Na(v)1.8 (CAG-inclusive) mRNA in mouse is approximately 2:1 in adult DRG, trigeminal ganglion, and neonatal DRG. A Na(v)1.8c isoform also occurs in rat DRG, but is less common. Of the two other tetrodotoxin-resistant channels, no analogous alternative splicing of mouse Na(v)1.9 was detected, whereas rare alternative splicing of Na(v)1.5 at a CAG/CAG motif resulted in the introduction of a CAG trinucleotide. This isoform, designated Na(v)1.5c, is conserved in rat and encodes an additional glutamine residue that disrupts a putative CK2 phosphorylation site. In summary, novel isoforms of Na(v)1.8 and Na(v)1.5 are each generated by alternative splicing at CAG/CAG motifs, which result in the absence or presence of predicted glutamine residues within the interdomain cytoplasmic loop IDII/III. Mutations of sodium channels within this cytoplasmic loop have previously been demonstrated to alter electrophysiological properties and cause cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2017455279,"Despite lacking transmembrane or intracellular domains, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins can modulate intracellular signaling events, in many cases through aggregation within membrane ""lipid raft"" microdomains. CEACAM6 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface protein of importance in the anchorage-independent survival and metastasis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. We examined the effects of antibody-mediated cross-linking of CEACAM6 on intracellular signaling events and anchorage-independent survival of the CEACAM6-overexpressing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line, BxPC3. CEACAM6 cross-linking increased c-Src activation and induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p125(FAK) focal adhesion kinase. Focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation was dependent on c-Src kinase activation, for which caveolin-1 was required. CEACAM6 cross-linking induced a significant increase in cellular resistance to anoikis. These observations represent the first characterization of the mechanism through which this important cell surface oncoprotein influences intracellular signaling events and hence malignant cellular behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2049501044,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates having dipeptide insertions in the fingers subdomain of the reverse transcriptase (RT) show high level resistance to 3 ′-azido-3 ′-deoxythymidine (AZT) and other nucleoside analogues. Insertions are usually associated with thymidine analogue resistance mutations, such as T215Y. The resistance phenotype correlates with increased ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity, which facilitates removal of thymidine analogues from inhibitor-terminated primers. In this report, we show that substituting Thr, Ser, or Asn for Tyr-215 in a multidrug-resistant RT, bearing a Ser-Ser insertion between codons 69 and 70, leads to AZT and stavudine resensitization through the loss of the ATP-mediated removal activity. The mutation D67N, which is rarely found in insertion-containing strains, had no effect on excision and a minor influence on resistance. Substituting Tyr-215 had a larger effect than deleting the dipeptide insertion. The presence of both the insertion and mutation T215Y in the wild-type BH10 RT conferred significant ATP-mediated removal activity and moderate resistance to AZT. However, resistance levels and unblocking activities were lower than those observed with the multidrug-resistant enzyme. Removal reactions can be inhibited by the next complementary dNTP. Both Tyr-215 and the dipeptide insertion affect RT-DNA·DNA-dNTP ternary complex formation, an effect that was not detected in the presence of foscarnet. Based on crystal structures of binary and ternary complexes of HIV-1 RT, we propose that Tyr-215 exerts its action by facilitating a proper orientation of the pyrophosphate donor molecule, whereas the effects on dNTP binding are indirect and could be related to significant conformational changes occurring during polymerization. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates having dipeptide insertions in the fingers subdomain of the reverse transcriptase (RT) show high level resistance to 3 ′-azido-3 ′-deoxythymidine (AZT) and other nucleoside analogues. Insertions are usually associated with thymidine analogue resistance mutations, such as T215Y. The resistance phenotype correlates with increased ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity, which facilitates removal of thymidine analogues from inhibitor-terminated primers. In this report, we show that substituting Thr, Ser, or Asn for Tyr-215 in a multidrug-resistant RT, bearing a Ser-Ser insertion between codons 69 and 70, leads to AZT and stavudine resensitization through the loss of the ATP-mediated removal activity. The mutation D67N, which is rarely found in insertion-containing strains, had no effect on excision and a minor influence on resistance. Substituting Tyr-215 had a larger effect than deleting the dipeptide insertion. The presence of both the insertion and mutation T215Y in the wild-type BH10 RT conferred significant ATP-mediated removal activity and moderate resistance to AZT. However, resistance levels and unblocking activities were lower than those observed with the multidrug-resistant enzyme. Removal reactions can be inhibited by the next complementary dNTP. Both Tyr-215 and the dipeptide insertion affect RT-DNA·DNA-dNTP ternary complex formation, an effect that was not detected in the presence of foscarnet. Based on crystal structures of binary and ternary complexes of HIV-1 RT, we propose that Tyr-215 exerts its action by facilitating a proper orientation of the pyrophosphate donor molecule, whereas the effects on dNTP binding are indirect and could be related to significant conformational changes occurring during polymerization. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; NRTI, nucleoside analogue RT inhibitor; NNRTI, non-nucleoside RT inhibitor; PPi, pyrophosphate; 3TC, 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine; AZT, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine; d4T, 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine; ddC, 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine; ddI, 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine; TAM, thymidine analogue resistance mutation. reverse transcriptase (RT) replicates the viral genomic RNA to synthesize a double-stranded DNA that integrates into the host genome. The viral enzyme is multifunctional, possessing RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, RNase H, strand transfer, and strand displacement activities (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of two polypeptide chains of 66 and 51 kDa, with subdomains termed fingers, thumb, palm, and connection in both subunits and an RNase H domain in the larger subunit only. HIV-1 RT is an important target for chemotherapeutic intervention in the control of AIDS. Antiretroviral drugs targeting the viral polymerase include nucleoside analogue inhibitors (NRTIs), acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) (reviewed in Ref. 2Menéndez-Arias L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 381-388Google Scholar). Inside the cell, nucleoside derivatives are converted to their active triphosphate forms by host cell kinases and are then incorporated into the HIV-1 genome by the viral RT. Because nucleoside analogues lack a 3′-OH group, their incorporation blocks elongation of the growing DNA chain. On the other hand, NNRTIs bind to an allosteric site located 10-15 Å away from the polymerase active site, distorting the geometry and/or the mobility of the polymerase catalytic site, interfering with the proper positioning of the template-primer in the nucleic acid-binding cleft of the RT or restricting the mobility of the thumb, which results in the impairment of translocation during polymerization (for reviews, see Refs. 3Jonckheere H. Anné J. De Clercq E. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 129-154Google Scholar and 4Erickson J.W. Burt S.K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 545-571Google Scholar). Although NNRTIs resistance mutations exert their action by diminishing the ability of the enzyme to bind the inhibitor (i.e. Y181C for nevirapine, K103N for nevirapine, delavirdine, and efavirenz, etc.), NRTI resistance mutations act either by (i) increasing discrimination against the triphosphate forms of the drugs (reviewed in Refs. 5Sluis-Cremer N. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1408-1422Google Scholar and 6Selmi B. Deval J. Boretto J. Canard B. Antivir. Ther. 2003; 8: 143-154Google Scholar) or (ii) increasing the ability of RT to unblock inhibitor-terminated DNA chains in the presence of physiological concentrations of pyrophosphate (PPi) or ATP (7Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Google Scholar, 8Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutations such as M184V or M184I, which confer resistance to 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC; lamivudine) are examples of the first mechanism (10Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Clark Jr., A.D. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10027-10032Google Scholar). On the other hand, RTs harboring the 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT; zidovudine)-associated mutations D67N and K70R in the fingers subdomain, together with the substitution T215Y, displayed an increased ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity that facilitates the efficient removal of AZT and 2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine (d4T; stavudine) from blocked DNA chains (11Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Schinazi R.F. So A.G. Scott W.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3465-3472Google Scholar). Despite being detectable, the excision reaction appears to be much less efficient with other clinically relevant nucleosides, such as 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (ddC; zalcitabine), abacavir, 3TC, 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine (ddI; didanosine), and tenofovir (12Boyer P.L.

Prolonged use of antiretroviral drugs in the clinical treatment of HIV-infected patients has resulted in the emergence of viral isolates with reduced susceptibilities to multiple RT inhibitors. Among multidrug-resistant viruses, resistance to multiple NRTIs can be achieved by three different major pathways: (i) accumulation of thymidine analogue resistance mutations (TAMs), (i.e. M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, and K219Q/E), which have a clinical impact on AZT, d4T, ddI, abacavir, and tenofovir resistance (16Larder B.A. J.

In phenotypic assays, these viruses display high level resistance to AZT and moderate levels of resistance to other NRTIs, such as d4T, ddC, and ddI (25Winters M.A. Coolley K.L. Girard Y.A.

Although the biochemical properties of the wild-type HIV-1BH10 RT were not significantly altered upon introduction of a dipeptide (Ser-Ser) insertion, we have previously shown that eliminating the insertion in the sequence context of an HIV-1 RT bearing the drug-related mutations M41L, A62V, K70R, V118I, M184I, L210W, T215Y, and G333E produced a significant reduction of the ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity that allows excision of AZT or d4T from inhibitor-terminated primers (13Mas A. Vá;zquez-Álvarez B.M. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 181-197Google Scholar, 27Mas A. Parera M. Briones C. Soriano V. Martínez M.A. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5752-5761Google Scholar). These data correlated with a significant reduction in the viral susceptibility to AZT (27Mas A. Parera M. Briones C. Soriano V. Martínez M.A. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5752-5761Google Scholar). However, eliminating the insertion was not sufficient to abrogate AZT resistance, because of the presence of TAMs in the insertion-containing viral isolate. In this work, we have analyzed the impact of TAMs D67N and T215Y on the ATP- and PPi-mediated removal of AZT- and d4T-monophosphate by SS RT. These two mutations were chosen based on available genotypic data showing that T215Y/F is the most frequently found mutation in viral isolates containing insertions in the fingers subdomain, whereas D67N appears very rarely in those viral strains, despite being a commonly selected mutation during treatment with thymidine analogues. RTs—Expression and purification of wild-type BH10, SS, and mutant SS_2S0S were done as previously described (27Mas A. Parera M. Briones C. Soriano V. Martínez M.A. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5752-5761Google Scholar). Other mutant RTs were generated by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions. Individual mutations Y215T, Y215N, Y215S, and D67N were introduced in plasmid pRT6 carrying the nucleotide sequence encoding the 66-kDa subunit of SS RT (27Mas A. Parera M. Briones C. Soriano V. Martínez M.A. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5752-5761Google Scholar) to generate mutant enzymes designated as SS_Y215T, SS_Y215N, SS_Y215S, and SS_D67N, respectively (see Fig. 1). On the other hand, the mutation T215Y was introduced in a pRT6 construct encoding a mutated p66 subunit of BH10 RT, which contained the T69SSS insertion (27Mas A. Parera M. Briones C. Soriano V. Martínez M.A. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5752-5761Google Scholar). This double mutant T69SSS/T215Y was designated as BH10_SSSY. The mutagenic primers used were: 5′-GGAGGTGGGGATTTACCACACCAGACAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTGTCTGGTGTGGTAAATCCCCACCT-3′ for SS_Y215T; 5′-GGAGGTGGGGATTTTCCACACCAGACAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTGTCTGGTGTGGAAAATCCCCACCT-3′ for SS_Y215S; 5′-GGAGGTGGGGATTTAACACACCAGACAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTGTCTGGTGTGTTAAATCCCCACCT-3′ for SS_Y215N; 5′-GTCATAAAGAAAAAAAATAGTTCTAGTTCTAGATGGAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGAACTAGAACTATTTTTTTTCTTTATG-3′ for SS_D67N; and 5′-GAGGTGGGGACTTTACACACCAGACAAAAAACATC-3′ and 5′-GATGTTTTTTGTCTGGTGTGTAAAGTCCCCACCTC-3′ for BH10_ SSSY. The introduced mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the appropriate MscI-KpnI inserts were then cloned in plasmids derived from pT51H (27Mas A. Parera M. Briones C. Soriano V. Martínez M.A. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5752-5761Google Scholar, 29Martìn-Herná;ndez A.M. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4434-4442Google Scholar), for expression of the p51 subunits of SS or BH10 RTs. All of the RTs were purified as p66/p51 heterodimers, and the mutations were introduced in both subunits of the enzyme. The 51-kDa polypeptide was obtained with an extension of 14 amino acids at its N-terminal end, which includes 6 consecutive histidine residues to facilitate its purification by metal chelate affinity chromatography, as previously described (29Martìn-Herná;ndez A.M. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4434-4442Google Scholar). Nucleotides and Template-Primers—The triphosphate derivatives of NRTIs were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (AZT-triphosphate) and Sierra Bioresearch (d4T-triphosphate). Stock solutions of dNTPs and rNTPs (100 mm) were from Amersham Biosciences. Before use, nucleoside-triphosphates were treated with inorganic pyrophosphatase to remove traces of PPi, as described (13Mas A. Vá;zquez-Álvarez B.M. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 181-197Google Scholar). As in previous studies, we used the following heteropolymeric oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) as DNA·DNA template-primer substrates: 5′-GGGTCCTTTCTTACCTGCAAGAATGTATAGCCCTACCA-3′ (termed D38) served as DNA template, and 5′-TGGTAGGGCTATACATTCTTGCAGG-3′ (termed 25PGA) was used as the primer strand. Polyacrylamide gel-purified oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′-termini with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The phosphorylated primers were then annealed to gel-purified templates in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl and 150 mm magnesium acetate, as described (30Martìn-Herná;ndez A.M. Gutiérrez-Rivas M. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1383-1389Google Scholar). The template-primer molar ratio was adjusted to 1:1. Chain Terminator Removal Assays—RT-catalyzed DNA rescue reactions were performed with D38/25PGA DNA duplexes as previously described (13Mas A. Vá;zquez-Álvarez B.M. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 181-197Google Scholar). Briefly, the phosphorylated template-primer (30 nm) was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of the corresponding RT at 15-20 nm active enzyme concentration, in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.0), containing 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 130 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000. The reactions were initiated by adding an equal amount of preincubation buffer containing AZT-triphosphate or d4T-triphosphate at a final concentration of 25 μm. After incubating the samples at 37 °C for 30 min, the rescue reactions were initiated by adding a mixture of all dNTPs at a final concentration of 100 μm, in the presence of sodium PPi (200 μm) or ATP (3.2 mm) depending on the assay. Because the next complementary dNTP (dATP, in our assay conditions) has an inhibitory effect on the rescue reaction, time courses of the unblocking and extension reactions were carried out in the presence of 1 μm dATP. Sodium foscarnet (Sigma) inhibition was monitored under these conditions by adding the inhibitor (at 0 to 800 μm), together with the mixture of dNTPs. In experiments designed to assess the inhibitory effect of dATP, the extension reactions were incubated for 0-15 min in the presence of different concentrations of dATP. In all cases, the incubation times were within the linear range of the corresponding time course. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal amount of 10 mm EDTA in 90% formamide containing 3 mg/ml xylene cyanol FF and 3 mg/ml bromphenol blue. The products were resolved on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide-urea gel, and primer rescue was quantified by phosphorimaging with a Bas 1500 scanner (Fuji), using the program Tina version 2.09 (Raytest Isotopenmessgerate Gmbh, Staubenhardt, Germany). Template-Primer Binding Affinity—Dissociation constants (Kd) of RT-DNA·DNA complexes were determined in accordance with the procedure described by Astatke et al. (31Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Google Scholar). For these experiments, primer 25PGA was blocked at its 3′ end with d4T-triphosphate, using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase as previously described (13Mas A. Vá;zquez-Álvarez B.M. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 181-197Google Scholar). Then the gel-purified inhibitor-terminated primer was labeled at its 5′ terminus with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed to template D38 as described above. The 38-mer DNA template primed with 5′32P-labeled d4T-terminated 25-mer (D38/25PGAd4T) (0.3 nm) was incubated with varying concentrations of the corresponding RTs in a total volume of 10 μl of 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.0), containing 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 130 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000. Following incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the samples were analyzed on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate buffer (85 mm Tris and 85 mm boric acid, pH 8.0). The amount of template-primer in the RT-bound form was determined by phosphorimaging. The percentage of complexed DNA was plotted against the enzyme concentration, and the Kd[DNA] value was determined as the RT concentration at which 50% of the DNA is bound. Stable Ternary Complex Formation Assays and Determination of dNTP Binding Affinity (Apparent Kd[dNTP])—The ability of HIV-1 RT variants to form a stable ternary complex was assessed as described (32Tong W. Lu C.-D. Sharma S.K. Matsuura S. So A.G. Scott W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5749-5757Google Scholar, 33Sharma B. Kaushik N. Singh K. Kumar S. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15685-15697Google Scholar). For this purpose, RTs (20 nm) were incubated with the labeled D38/25PGAd4T template-primer (0.3 nm) to form the binary complex under the conditions described above and then further incubated at 37 °C in the presence of an excess of dNTP (200 μm dATP, in our assay conditions) to obtain a stable ternary complex. The putative ternary complexes formed were challenged with unlabeled D38/25PGAd4T template-primer at a final concentration of 500 nm. The ternary complex species resistant to the DNA trap were resolved on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel, subjected to phosphorimaging, and quantified using the Tina software. The apparent dNTP binding affinity (apparent Kd[dNTP]) of the variant RTs was determined as described above, except that the binary complexes were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of the complementary nucleotide (dATP, 0-4000 μm) prior to being challenged with the DNA trap. In some experiments, ternary complexes were obtained in the presence of 200 μm foscarnet to monitor the effect of the PPi analogue in the apparent Kd[dNTP]. The RT-DNA·DNA-dNTP complexes resistant to the trap were resolved and quantified as indicated above. To determine the apparent Kd[dNTP], the percentage of total RT-DNA·DNA complex converted into stable RT-DNA·DNA-dNTP ternary complex as a function of the concentration of dNTP was fitted to the single-site ligand-binding equation. Recombinant Virus and Drug Susceptibility Tests—The assays were performed as previously described (27Mas A. Parera M. Briones C. Soriano V. Martínez M.A. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5752-5761Google Scholar, 34Gutiérrez-Rivas M. Ibá;ñez A. Martínez M.A. Domingo E. Menéndez-Arias L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 615-625Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length RT-coding sequence DNA was amplified from plasmids carrying the different RTs using primers IN5 (5′-AATTTTCCCATTAGTCCTATTGAAACTGTACCA-3′) and IN3 (5′-TCTATTCCATCYAAAAATAGTACTTTCCTGATTCC-3′). The PCR products were then cotransfected with an RT-deleted HXB2-D clone in SupT1 cells (35Kellam P. Larder B.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 23-30Google Scholar). When the HIV-1 p24 antigen concentration in the cultures surpassed 20 ng/ml, the supernatants were harvested. Progeny virus was propagated and titrated in MT-4 cells. The nucleotide sequence of the RT-coding region of the progeny virus was checked for possible reversions or additional mutations. The SupT1 and MT-4 cells and the deleted HXB2-D clone were obtained from the AIDS Reagent Program (Medical Research Council). HIV-1 drug susceptibility profiles were obtained after infecting 35000 MT-4 cells with 100 50% tissue culture infective doses of virus, at a multiplicity of infection of 0.003, by exposing the HIV-1-infected cultures to various concentrations of each drug (5-fold dilutions). After MT-4 cells were allowed to proliferate for 5 days, the number of viable cells was determined by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric method as described (27Mas A. Parera M. Briones C. Soriano V.

Mutations Associated with Insertions in the Fingers Subdomain of HIV-1 RT—Although with a relatively low prevalence (0.5-2.7%), several studies have identified heavily treated patients carrying HIV-1 isolates with RTs containing an insertion in the fingers subdomain plus additional resistance mutations, including TAMs (37Balotta C.

We have done an extensive survey of the literature to generate a data base containing 200 sequences of RTs having insertions of one or two amino acids between codons 69 and 70 (supplemental table). The most frequently found insertions were Ser-Gly, Ser-Ser, and Ser-Ala, which represented approximately two-thirds of the total number of sequences reported. Interestingly, TAMs frequently associated with insertions include M41L, K70R, L210W, and T215Y/F. An aromatic residue at position 215 was observed in 90% of all isolates and appeared in all strains having a Ser-Ser insertion. On the other hand, the classical AZT resistance mutation D67N was never found in consensus sequences of insertion-containing RTs from clinical samples, although it has been occasionally observed in clones derived from viral populations (42Lukashov V.V. Huismans R. Jebbink M.F. Danner S.A. De Boer R.J. Goudsmit J. AIDS Res. Human Retrovir. 2001; 17: 807-818Google Scholar). The SS RT is a good model to study the effect of those mutations, because this polymerase contains both the insertion and the T215Y mutation while having wild-type Asp at position 67 (Fig. 1). We constructed mutants having the SS RT background where Tyr-215 was replaced by Thr (SS_Y215T), Ser (SS_Y215S), or Asn (SS_Y215N) or where Asp-67 was replaced by Asn (SS_D67N). The amino acid substitution Y215T involves two nucleotide changes at codon 215, whereas Y215S and Y215N involve just one nucleotide change and are potential intermediates during a possible reversion of Tyr to wild-type Thr. In addition, both the insertion and T215Y were introduced in the sequence context of the wild-type BH10 RT (mutant BH10_SSSY) to determine whether both changes were sufficient to confer resistance to thymidine analogues. The properties of all mutants on primer unblocking, dNTP inhibition, and DNA chain elongation, as well as their ability to form stable ternary complexes were compared with those of reference RTs (i.e. SS and BH10 RTs), as well as of mutant SS_2S0S, which lacks the dipeptide insertion while maintaining the SS RT sequence background. Removal of AZT- and d4T-Monophosphate from Blocked DNA Primers—The ability of RTs to rescue AZT- and d4T-terminated primers was assessed by using the template-primer shown in Fig. 2A. These experiments were carried out in two steps. First, the HIV-1 RT was incubated with the template-primer in the presence of the triphosphate form of the inhibitor. Then unblocking and extension reactions leading to the accumulation of a 38-nucleotide product were carried out by adding dNTPs in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP or PPi (3.2 mm and 200 μm, respectively). These reactions can be inhibited by the next complementary dNTP (dATP in our assay conditions), and therefore time courses were carried out in the presence of low dATP concentrations (i.e. 1 μm). Non-complementary dNTPs were included at 100 μm to facilitate full extension of primers after removal of chain-terminating nucleotides. At these concentrations, inhibition of the rescue reaction because of potential mispairs between the template T and dGTP, dTTP, or dCTP was found to be negligible. In the presence of ATP, AZT removal reactions catalyzed by SS and mutant SS_D67N RTs showed the highest efficiency, whereas SS RT mutants lacking an aromatic side chain at position 215 (i.e. mutants SS_Y215T, SS_Y215N, and SS_Y215S) were devoid of ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity (Fig. 2B). Substituting Tyr-215 had a larger effect than deleting the two serines forming the insertion. However, the presence of the insertion together with an aromatic residue at position 215, as in mutant BH10_SSSY, was not sufficient to confer the high ATP-dependent phosphorolytic activity displayed by the SS_RT. The large differences observed between mutant enzymes in ATP-dependent phosphorolysis using AZT-terminated primers were not detected in phosphorolytic reactions when PPi was used as the donor (Fig. 2C). All of the enzymes showed AZT-monophosphate removal rates that were within a 2-fold range of each other. The time courses for d4T removal in the presence of ATP were similar to those obtained with AZT-terminated primers for all tested RTs (Fig. 3A). D67N had no effect on the removal reaction, whereas eliminating the aromatic side chain of Tyr-215 had a deleterious effect of the unblocking activity. Interestingly, some differences were also detected between the enzymes when analyzing PPi-mediated removal of d4T monophosphate from chain-terminated primers. Excision rates were approximately three times higher for SS RT than for mutants SS_Y215T, SS_Y215S, and SS_Y215N (F"

https://openalex.org/W1983250148,"The precise role of alpha-actinin-4 encoding gene (ACTN4) is not very well understood. It has been reported to elicit tumor suppressor activity and to regulate cellular motility. To further assess the function of human ACTN4, we studied a lung carcinoma cell line expressing a mutated alpha-actinin-4, which is recognized as a tumor antigen by autologous CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that, while wild-type (WT) alpha-actinin-4 stains into actin cytoskeleton and cell surface ruffles, the mutated protein is only dispersed in the cytoplasm of the lung carcinoma cells. This loss of association with the cell surface did not appear to correlate with a decrease in in vitro alpha-actinin-4 crosslinking to filamentous (F)-actin. Interestingly, experiments using cell lines stably expressing ACTN4 demonstrated that as opposed to WT gene, mutant ACTN4 was unable to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the expression of mutant alpha-actinin-4 resulted in the loss of tumor cell capacity to migrate. The identification of an inactivating mutation in ACTN4 emphasizes its role as a tumor suppressor gene and underlines the involvement of cytoskeleton alteration in tumor development and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2034319912,"The eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II is a dyadic enzyme that, upon ATP binding, transports one duplex DNA (T-segment) through a transient double-stranded break in another (G-segment). The path of the T-segment involves the sequential crossing of three gates along the dimer interface: the entrance or N-gate, the DNA gate, and the exit or C-gate. Coordination among these gates is critical for dimer stability and the prevention of chromosome damage. This study examines DNA transactions by yeast topoisomerase II derivatives defective in gate function. The results indicate that, although the N-gate is not required for G-segment cleavage, the DNA gate per se is not able to widen unless ATP binds to the N-gate. Next, a captured T-segment cannot be held in the interdomainal region between the N-gate and the DNA gate. Finally, the G-segment can be religated while a T-segment is held in the central cavity of the enzyme between the DNA gate and the C-gate. These quaternary couplings for gate opening and closing suggest that topoisomerase II ensures a transient DNA gating state, during which dimer interface contacts are maximized and backtracking of the transported DNA is minimized."

The mechanism by which this interregulation of CFTR and ENaC occurs in oocytes is unclear and somewhat controversial. Others have suggested that the decrease in ENaC-mediated current after CFTR activation may result from a series resistor error (20Nagel G. Szellas T. Riordan J.R. Friedrich T. Hartung K.

Furthermore such a mechanism cannot account for the increased CFTR functional expression observed with co-expression of rodent ENaC (9Ji H.L. Chalfant M.L. Jovov B. Lockhart J.P. Parker S.B.

The present studies were aimed at better understanding the regulatory interactions between CFTR and ENaC and whether there are species-specific differences in these interactions. In this regard, our data are consistent with the decrease in mENaC functional expression that occurs with CFTR activation being due, in part, to decreased mENaC surface expression, while hENaC (with Ala in position α663) functional and surface expression does not decrease following CFTR activation. These observations led us to test two additional hypotheses. First we tested the hypothesis that the C terminus of the ENaC α subunit, which has limited homology between mouse and human, may influence the species-related differences in this interaction. We also tested the hypothesis that a naturally occurring polymorphism in the C terminus of α hENaC, substitution of Ala at residue 663 for Thr (T663A), which we have recently shown to decrease the functional and surface expression of hENaC in oocytes, 2Samaha, F.

Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M401941200 would influence regulatory interactions between CFTR and hENaC. Our data suggest that the C terminus of α hENaC confers species specificity regarding ENaC inhibition by activated CFTR, whereas the αT663A polymorphism has a modest effect on the response of hENaC to activated CFTR. Materials—Forskolin and IBMX were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were purchased from Fisher. Expression of Human CFTR and Mouse and Human ENaC in Xenopus Oocytes—Human CFTR (wild type and ΔF508) and mouse and human ENaC were expressed in Xenopus oocytes as described previously (10Jiang Q.

Briefly human CFTR and mouse and human α, β, and γ ENaC cRNAs were prepared using a cRNA synthesis kit (mMESSAGE mMACHINE, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cRNA concentrations were determined spectroscopically. Oocytes obtained from adult female Xenopus laevis (NASCO, Fort Atkinson, WI) were enzymatically defolliculated and maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate). Each batch of oocytes obtained from an individual frog was injected (50 nl/oocyte) using a Nanoject II microinjector (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) with α, β, and γ subunits of either mENaC (0.33 ng/subunit) or hENaC (2 ng/subunit), CFTR (wild type or ΔF508, 10 ng), or a combination of ENaC and CFTR cRNAs dissolved in RNase-free water. Electrophysiological Analyses—Whole cell current measurements were performed 24-48 h after injection using the two-electrode voltage clamp method as described previously (10Jiang Q. Li J. Dubroff R.

Oocytes were placed in a 1-ml chamber containing modified ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 5.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and impaled with micropipettes of 0.5-5-megaohm resistance filled with 3 m KCl. The whole cell currents were measured by voltage clamping the oocytes in 20-mV steps between -140 and +60 mV adjusted for resting transmembrane potential. Whole cell currents (I) were digitized at 200 Hz during the voltage steps, recorded directly onto a hard disk, and analyzed using pClamp 8.1 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). To reduce error due to series resistance, the voltage clamp (Axon Geneclamp 500B) was configured to clamp the bath potential to 0 mV. In this configuration, we independently monitored the oocyte membrane potential during our clamp protocol and routinely observed membrane potentials that were <5% depolarized from our target holding potentials. The difference in whole cell currents measured in the absence and presence of 10 μm amiloride was used to define the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current that was carried by ENaC. CFTR was activated by perfusion of the oocyte with buffer containing 10 μm forskolin and 500 μm IBMX (forskolin/IBMX) for 25 min (10Jiang Q. Li J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J.

Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

After 48 h, oocytes were treated with forskolin/IBMX for 20 min and cell surface proteins of oocytes that were mechanically stripped of their vitellin membranes in hypertonic medium (300 mm sucrose in modified Barth's saline without penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamicin) were labeled with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) as we have described previously. 2Samaha, F.

Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M401941200 Oocytes (10/group) were subsequently lysed in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.01 m EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), 0.1 mm l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl-chloromethyl ketone, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and labeled proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose (Pierce). Immunoblot Analysis—Streptavidin-precipitated proteins or whole oocyte lysates (prepared as above) were incubated in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously by our group. 2Samaha, F.

Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M401941200 β-V5 was identified by immunoblot using an anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) visualization essentially as described previously by our group (24Rubenstein R.C.

Fluorogram density was quantitated using an AlphaImager 2200 system and version 5.5 software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA), and the intensity of β-V5 was expressed relative to that of oocytes injected with ENaC alone without forskolin/IBMX stimulation. As in our previous work, 2Samaha, F. F., Rubenstein, R. C., Yan, W., Ramkumar, M., Levy, D. I., Ahn, Y. J., Sheng, S., and Kleyman, T. R. (April 6, 2004) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M401941200 less than 20% of intracellular β-V5 epitope was biotin-labeled in oocytes expressing only β-V5 and γ ENaC subunits (data not shown). Statistical Analyses—All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Student's t test. A pairwise t test was used for pre/post-treatment in experiments using an individual oocyte. A two-tailed t test was used when comparing currents obtained from oocytes injected with a cRNA for a single transporter (i.e. ENaC or CFTR versus oocytes co-injected with cRNAs for both ENaC and CFTR). p values ≤0.05 were accepted to indicate statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat version 2.03 software. Regulatory Interactions between mENaC and CFTR in Xenopus Oocytes—Several groups have reported that when wild type CFTR and rodent (murine or rat) ENaC were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, ENaC-mediated Na+ currents were inhibited in response to CFTR activation in two-electrode voltage clamp (TEV) experiments (7Chabot H.

Oocytes co-injected with mENaC and CFTR had reduced amiloride-sensitive current (-1.36 ± 0.20 μA, n = 10) compared with oocytes injected with mENaC alone (-3.23 ± 0.75 μA, p = 0.03), and this amiloride-sensitive current was further reduced in co-injected oocytes upon activation of CFTR with forskolin/IBMX (-0.89 ± 0.20 μA, p = 0.01, Fig. 1A). Also in agreement with our previous data (10Jiang Q. Li J. Dubroff R. Ahn Y.J. Foskett J.K. Engelhardt J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13266-13274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Suaud L. Li J. Jiang Q. Rubenstein R.C. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8928-8933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), co-injection of mENaC with CFTR increased the functional expression of CFTR (-10.08 ± 1.07 μA, n = 10) compared with oocytes injected with CFTR alone (-2.12 ± 0.42 μA, n = 10, p < 0.001, Fig. 1B). As the mechanism by which these alterations in mENaC functional expression upon co-expression and activation of CFTR occur is not clear, we performed surface biotinylation experiments to assess the amount of mENaC at the oocyte surface. In these experiments, we used mENaC where the β subunit contained a C-terminal V5 epitope tag to increase sensitivity of our immunoblots; control experiments suggested that this β mENaC modification did not influence regulatory interactions between CFTR and mENaC as measured by TEV (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1C, mENaC(β-V5) expression at the oocyte surface was unaltered by forskolin/IBMX in oocytes injected with mENaC alone. In contrast, mENaC surface expression decreased when mENaC was co-expressed with CFTR and was further decreased by activation of CFTR in oocytes expressing both channels. There was direct correspondence of these changes in surface expression of mENaC(β-V5) and the mENaC-mediated currents by TEV (Fig. 1A), suggesting that alterations in mENaC functional expression are, in part, a result of changes in mENaC expression at the oocyte surface (or “N”). We also assessed whole oocyte expression of mENaC(β-V5) (Fig. 1D). Expression of mENaC(β-V5) was decreased by coinjection of CFTR but was not further decreased upon activation of CFTR with forskolin/IBMX. These data are consistent with CFTR activation causing an acute decrease in mENaC(β-V5) surface and functional expression without altering the total amount of mENaC(β-V5) present in the oocyte. Co-expression of CFTR and hENaC—We next assessed regulatory interactions between CFTR and hENaC as well as the potential influence of the T663A functional polymorphism of α hENaC described recently by our group2 on these interactions. Similar to our data with mENaC (Fig. 1A), forskolin/IBMX did not alter hENaC functional expression in oocytes injected with hENaC alone as is shown in Fig. 2A for α-T663-hENaC (-1.97 ± 0.27 versus -1.94 ± 0.30 μA, n = 21, p = ns) and in Fig. 2B for α-A663-hENaC (-1.85 ± 0.28 versus -1.95 ± 0.31 μA, n = 21, p = ns). Again co-injection of CFTR reduced hENaC functional expression prior to activation of CFTR (α-T663-hENaC: -1.97 ± 0.27 μA, n = 21 versus -0.81 ± 0.09 μA, n = 24, p < 0.001; α-A663-hENaC: -1.85 ± 0.28 μA, n = 21 versus -0.78 ± 0.15 μA, n = 25, p = 0.001). However, activation of CFTR in co-injected oocytes resulted in a further, more modest decrease in α-T663-hENaC functional expression (-0.81 ± 0.09 versus -0.65 ± 0.08 μA, n = 24, p = 0.02, Fig. 2A) compared with mENaC (Fig. 1A), and CFTR activation did not significantly decrease α-A663-hENaC functional expression (-0.78 ± 0.15 versus -0.69 ± 0.14 μA, n = 25, p = ns, Fig. 2B), although the lack of significance of this decrease for α-A663-hENaC may be related to the larger standard errors in these data compared with those of α-T663-hENaC. CFTR functional expression was enhanced by co-injection of α-T663-hENaC (coinjected: -6.32 ± 1.14 μA, n = 24, versus injected with CFTR alone: -2.83 ± 0.50 μA, n = 19, p = 0.009) or α-A663-hENaC (co-injected: -7.78 ± 1.32 μA, n = 25, versus injected with CFTR alone: -3.08 ± 0.40 μA, n = 19, p = 0.004, Fig. 2C) as it was by mENaC (Fig. 1B). We next sought to correlate the functional expression of α-A663-hENaC by TEV with its surface expression by surface biotinylation of oocytes expressing α-A663-hENaC (where the hENaC β subunit contained a C-terminal V5 epitope tag). Again there was direct correlation of α-A663-hENaC(β-V5) surface expression (Fig. 2D) and α-A663-hENaC functional expression by TEV (Fig. 2B). Surface and functional expression of α-A663-hENaC was not altered by treatment with forskolin/IBMX in oocytes injected with α-A663-hENaC alone. Co-injection of CFTR decreased surface and functional expression of α-A663-hENaC (Fig. 2, B and D) as well as whole oocyte expression of hENaC(β-V5) (Fig. 2E). Activation of CFTR with forskolin/IBMX in co-injected oocytes did not further alter surface or whole oocyte expression of hENaC(β-V5). These data suggest that the regulation of mENaC and hENaC by CFTR in oocytes differs and involves changes in mENaC surface expression in response to CFTR activa"

The remarkable evolutionary conservation and broad cellular and tissue distribution of this family of proteins suggest their fundamental importance in the cell, but the biological function of the core cyclophilin domain is unknown. CypA was first identified and purified from bovine spleen, based on its high affinity for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (4Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Google Scholar). CypA, similar to other cyclophilin family members, possesses enzymatic peptidylprolyl isomerase activity, which is essential to protein folding in vivo. Although CypA has a pivotal role in the immune response, it is not essential for mammalian cell viability (5Colgan J. Asmal M. Luban J. Genomics. 2000; 68: 167-178Google Scholar). Recently, different aspects of the biological function of CypA have emerged. CypA binds to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag protein and is required for wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication kinetics (6Braaten D. Luban J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1300-1309Google Scholar). CypA also promotes proper subcellular localization of Zpr1p, a zinc finger-containing protein (7Ansari H. Greco G. Luban J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6993-7003Google Scholar). Moreover, CypA regulates interleukin-2 tyrosine kinase activity (8Brazin K.N. Mallis R.J. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1899-1904Google Scholar) and has been implicated in neuronal cell growth and differentiation (9Nahreini P. Hovland A.R. Kumar B. Andreatta C. Edwards-Prasad J. Prasad K.N. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 21: 65-79Google Scholar). These data provide a molecular basis for further understanding a role for CypA in cellular function. Although CypA is widely expressed in many tissues, it is most concentrated in the brain and located primarily in neurons (10Goldner F.M. Patrick J.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 372: 283-293Google Scholar). Our recent data demonstrate that the nuclei of ganglia sensor neurons are particularly enriched with CypA (11Chiu R. Rey O. Zheng J.-Q. Twiss J.L. Song J. Pang S. Yokoyama K.K. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2003; 23: 929-943Google Scholar), suggesting that CypA might be important for neuron cells. To test our hypothesis, we used siRNAs to block the expression of CypA in p19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, which have been used as a model system to study neuronal differentiation. Here we demonstrate that the vector-based system produces siRNAs in p19 EC cells and results in specific and persistent knockdown of CypA in stable transfectants. These CypA knockdown cell lines are consequently unresponsive to retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we confirm that the observed knockdown phenotype is the result of silencing of the intended target, by using a rescue plasmid to restore RA-induced differentiation potential as wild-type p19 EC cells. These results clearly indicate that CypA is essential during RA-induced neuronal differentiation of p19 EC cells. Plasmids—PCR was used to generate the U6 promoter and two cloning sites, SalI and HindIII. The PCR product was subcloned into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pPNT to generate the siRNA expression vector, pNeoRNAi (Fig. 1A). Target sites were selected from the mouse cyclophilin A sequence (GenBank™ accession number X52803). Each hairpin siRNA sequence contained a 5′ SalI cloning site followed by 20-mer of target sequences, a 4-mer loop sequence (TTCG), another 20-mer of complementary target sequence, the transcription terminator (TTTTT), and the 3′ HindIII cloning site. The full length of the sequences, which were synthesized in the forward and reverse directions and annealed to form double strand DNA, is approximately 70-mer. This double strand DNA was cloned into pNeoRNAi to form pNeoR-NAi-S1 and pNeoRNAi-S3. To construct pcDNA3-CypA-wt, full-length cDNA for mouse CypA was amplified using reverse transcriptase PCR. The fragment was then subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pcDNA3-CypA-re was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—Murine embryonal carcinoma cell line p19 cells were grown in minimum essential medium alpha supplemented with 7.5% bovine calf serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). RA-induced and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-induced differentiations of the pluripotent murine embryonal carcinoma p19 cell line were performed according to the method described by Gill et al. (12Gill R.M. Slack R. Kiess M. Hamel P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 157-170Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms each of plasmid pNeoRNAi-S1 and pNeoR-NAi-S3 were electroporated into 5 × 106 cells. G418 (300 μg/ml) was added to the medium the next day for selection of neomycin-resistant transfectants, which were then picked 2 weeks later and maintained in 24-well plates. Cells were cultured for an additional 2 weeks before harvesting for screening of CypA expression using Western blot analyses. Northern Blot Analyses—To detect the expression of siRNAs, 30 μgof each sample was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and electro-transferred to nylon membranes. Radiolabeled 20-mer oligonucleotides of the sense target sequence were used as probes. Western Blot Analyses—Whole cell lysates were electrophoresed and immunoblotted according to the protocol provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells cultured in Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalgene Nunc International, Naperville, IL) were fixed for 15 min at 25 °C in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at 25 °C. CypA was detected by indirect immunofluorescent staining with polyclonal anti-cyclophilin A (BIOMOL International, Plymouth Meeting, PA) followed by secondary antibody fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mounted coverslips were viewed with a BX41 Olympus fluorescence microscope, and images were captured with an Olympus digital camera. Cell Counts—Cells were counted using the trypan blue assay kit (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH). Equal numbers of cells were cultured in 6-well plates. The cells were harvested at different time points and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were gently resuspended in 200 μl of medium. Ten microliters of resuspended cells were gently mixed with 10 μl of trypan blue (0.4% in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 min, and the number of live cells was counted by microscopic examination. Luciferase Assays—Cells were cultured in 12-well plates and transfected with 2 μg of pTK-Luc or pRARE-TK-Luc using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were treated with RA (5 × 10-7m) 4 h post-transfection or left untreated for 24 h. Cell lysates were used for luciferase assays using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA were performed as described previously by Song et al. (13Song J. Ugai H. Kanazawa I. Sun K. Yokoyama K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19897-19904Google Scholar). An end-labeled (γ-[32P]ATP) double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a single RA response element (RARE) consensus sequence (sc-2559, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a template. For a competition study, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Mobility shift reactions were resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at -80 °C. Hairpin siRNAs Specifically Inhibit Expression of CypA— Attempting to test the hypothesis that CypA plays an important role in neuron cell function, we used small interfering RNAs to silence CypA expression in p19 EC cells, which have been used as a model system to study neuronal differentiation. The siRNA vector, pNeoRNAi, with a neomycin selection marker facilitated the establishment of CypA knockdown cell lines by producing hairpin siRNAs in p19 EC cells (Fig. 1B). Plasmids that express hairpin siRNAs were transfected into p19 EC cells, and G418 was used for the selection of neomycin-resistant transfected cell lines. The selected transfectant cells were screened for knockdown CypA expression by Western blot analysis, using anti-CypA antibodies (BIOMOL). CypA expression in transfectants S1-7 and S3-2 was significantly inhibited (Fig. 1C). Transfectants S1-1, S1-2, S3-1, and S3-6 were inhibited to a lesser extent (Fig. 1C). A neo-resistant transfectant demonstrated normal levels of CypA (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the inhibition of CypA resulted from the expression of siRNAs, we examined siRNA expression using Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1D). We detected expression of siRNAs (∼25 nucleotides) in S1-7 and S3-2, whereas none were present in cells transfected with empty vector or in wild-type p19 EC cells. Furthermore, no siRNAs were expressed in S1-6 (Fig. 1D), which has normal levels of CypA. These results demonstrate that the inhibition of CypA in the neo-resistant transfectants is dependent on the expression of siRNAs. To determine whether the expressed siRNAs specifically inhibit CypA, we performed Western blot analysis to see if other members of the cyclophilin family, such as Cyp 40 and FKBP12, could also be inhibited. Expression levels of Cyp 40 and FKBP12 in S1-7 and S3-2 were similar to those in wild-type cells and in cells transfected with the empty vector, pNe-oRNAi (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that the effects of siRNAs are highly specific. Long Term Effect of RNAi on CypA Inhibition—To determine whether the knockdown phenotypes are stable over time, expression levels of CypA in transfectants S1-7 and S3-2 were examined at different time points. In both cell lines, the expression of CypA was persistently inhibited at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after initial transfection as indicated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained by indirect immunofluorescent staining with anti-CypA followed by a secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fig. 2B). CypA expression was limited to a low level steady state by continuous expression of siRNAs in the stable transfectants. These results provide a model for adopting siRNA technology for the long term study of specific gene loss-of-function. CypA Is Required for RA-induced Neuronal Differentiation of p19 Cells—The cell growth rates of the established cell lines S1-7 and S3-2 were noticeably faster than that of wild-type p19 EC cells. We therefore counted cell numbers at different time points under normal cell culture conditions in the absence or presence of RA treatment. In the absence of RA, growth rates of S1-7 and S3-2 were faster than that of wild-type p19 EC cells (Fig. 3A). In wild-type p19 EC cells, the growth rate of RA-treated cells was slower than that of untreated cells. In contrast, the growth rates of S1-7 and S3-2 were not affected by RA treatment (Fig. 3A). These results prompted us to investigate the effect of suppressed CypA expression on RA-induced p19 cell neuronal differentiation. We first examined morphological changes during RA-induced neuronal differentiation (14Liour S.S. Kapitonov D. Yu R.K. J. Neurotics. Res. 2000; 62: 363-373Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, RA-induced neurite formation in p19 EC cells but not in S1-7 cells suggests that the CypA knockdown cells lose RA-induced differentiation potential. Next, we examined the expression of β-tubulin III and neurofilament as neuron-specific differentiation markers (15Alexander J.E. Hunt D.E. Lee M.K. Shabanowitz J. Michel H. Berlin S.C. MacDonald T.L.

Neurosci. 1993; 13: 285-299Google Scholar, 17Paterno G.D. Gillespie L.L. Julien J.P. Skup D. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 49: 247-254Google Scholar). We observed β-tubulin III in RA-induced differentiated p19 EC cells and in p19 EC cells transfected with empty vector, but β-tubulin III was undetectable in either of the knockdown cell lines S1-7 or S3-2 (Fig. 3C). Similarly, up-regulated neurofilament (68 kDa) was observed only in the wild-type p19 cells during retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that CypA is required for RA-induced neuronal differentiation in p19 EC cells. To examine whether knockdown CypA also affects Me2SO-induced mesodermal differentiation, we performed Western blot analysis to score the expression of GATA4 (18Lipskaia L. Grepin C. Defer N. Hanoune J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 50-56Google Scholar, 19Skerjanc I.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 139-143Google Scholar), which is expressed only in mesodermal differentiation. As shown in Fig 3E, GATA4 was expressed in Me2SO-treated p19 EC and S1-7 cells. These results demonstrate that knockdown CypA does not generally impair differentiation. CypA Is Involved in RARE-mediated Gene Regulation—RA-induced differentiation requires binding of the RA receptors (RAR) to the RARE to regulate a set of gene expressions. It is possible that in the CypA knockdown cell lines the loss of responsiveness to RA-induced neural differentiation results from the loss of CypA, which is involved in RARE-mediated gene regulation. To test this hypothesis, the pRARE-TK-Luc reporter was transfected into cells in the absence or presence of RA. The control cells increased luciferase activity 25-fold in response to RA, whereas the CypA knockdown cell line, S1-7, increased only 5-fold in the presence of RA (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the luciferase activity in cells transfected with pTK-Luc, a control reporter, did not vary in the absence or presence of RA treatment (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that CypA is important in RARE-mediated gene regulation and demonstrate that p19 cells lacking CypA lose responsiveness to RA treatment. To determine levels of RAR expression and RARE-binding activity in the stable knockdown cell line S1-7, we performed Western blot analysis and EMSA for RARβ expression and RARE-binding activity, respectively. RA enhanced RARβ expression in the wild-type p19 EC cells but not in the knockdown cell line S1-7 (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that RARβ expression is not inducible by RA treatment when the cells lack CypA. As shown in Fig. 4C, RA-treated cell extracts from control cells also increased binding activity (lane 5) compared with those extracts prepared from cells untreated with RA (lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, RA-treated cell extracts from the knockdown cell line S1-7 did not increase binding activity as exhibited in the control cells (lane 7). The specificity of RARE-binding activity was confirmed by competition assay with a cold probe (lane 3). Rescue of the Knockdown Phenotype Restores RA-induced Neuronal Differentiation—To ensure that the observed knockdown phenotype as described above is the result of silencing CypA, the intended target, we developed a “knockdown-and- rescue” system to restore siRNA effects. We transfected an expression plasmid, pcDNA3-CypA-re, which contains four silent mutations (Fig. 5A) at the siRNA targeting sequence, into the CypA knockdown S1-7 cell line. Because this expressed, mutated CypA message was not recognized and degraded by existing siRNAs in the established cells, its gene product can function as wild-type CypA. Therefore, we expected a reverted phenotype that can function as wild-type p19 EC cells. pNeoR-NAi vector-transfected p19 cells were used as a control cell line. As shown in Fig. 5B, elevated expression levels of CypA were detected in pNeoRNAi-transfected p19 cells, indicating the detectable expression of CypA by ectopically transfected pcDNA3-CypA-wt or pcDNA3-CypA-re expression plasmids. In the S1-7 cell line, expression of CypA was reinstated only by the transfected pcDNA3-CypA-re plasmid (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that the rescue vector successfully restored CypA, the target gene product. To determine whether the revertants could restore RA-induced neuronal differentiation, either pcDNA3-CypA-wt or pcDNA3-CypA-re was transfected into the S1-7 cell line, which was then treated with RA. The neuron-specific differentiation marker, β-tubulin III, was observed with expression of pcDNA3-CypA-re but not pcDNA3-CypA-wt in S1-7 cells (Fig. 5C). To determine whether the rescued revertant affects RARE-mediated gene regulation, either pcDNA3-CypA-wt or pcDNA3-CypA-re was co-transfected with the pRARE-TK-Luc reporter into the S1-7 cell line in the absence or presence of RA. Similar to the control pNeoRNAi-transfected cells, luciferase activity in pcDNA3-CypA-re-transfected S1-7 cells was enhanced by treatment with RA (Fig. 5D). The activity of luciferase was not significantly enhanced by treatment with RA in the pcDNA3-CypA-wt-ransfected cells. pTK-Luc was transfected into cells as a control reporter (Fig. 5D). These results demonstrate that, although p19 cells lacking CypA showed a loss of responsiveness to activation of RAR-mediated gene expression through RARE binding, the restored expression of CypA recovered the activity. The effects of transient transfection of siRNAs is well documented, but the data are very limited for knockdown cell lines targeting highly expressed housekeeping genes. Thus, we examined the long term effect of CypA knockdown in neo-resistant transfectants. These cell lines showed a stable and persistent inhibition of CypA up to 12 weeks after initial transfection (Fig. 2). CypA expression was limited to a low steady state level by continuous expression of siRNAs in the stable transfectants. These results provide a model for adopting the siRNA technology in the long term study of specific gene loss-of-function. CypA belongs to the evolutionarily conserved immunophilin family and is widely expressed in many tissues. Particularly high expression levels in brain and neuronal tissues (17Paterno G.D. Gillespie L.L. Julien J.P. Skup D. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 49: 247-254Google Scholar) suggest that CypA might be important for neuron cell development and differentiation. Our data provide evidence for a novel function of CypA in RA-induced neural differentiation of p19 cells (Figs. 3 and 4). However, a lack of CypA in the S1-7 cell line did not affect Me2SO-induced (cardiac muscle pathway) mesodermal differentiation, suggesting that the differentiation is not generally impaired in the CypA knockdown pluripotent p19 murine embryonal carcinoma cell line. Specifically, p19 cells lacking CypA showed a loss of responsiveness to activation of RAR-mediated gene expression through RARE binding. This loss of responsiveness suggests that CypA might affect the binding of RAR to RARE in regulating gene expression. Because CypA possesses enzymatic peptidylprolyl isomerase activity, which is essential to protein folding in vivo, CypA may be involved in the conformation of RAR binding. To further address this point, we performed Western blot analysis and EMSA for detection of RARβ expression and RARE-binding activity, respectively. Compared with the control cells, our data demonstrated that RA does not enhance RARβ relative expression in the CypA knockdown cell line S1-7 (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the RARE-binding activity also loses response to RA treatment (Fig. 4C). These results implied that CypA affects RARE-mediated regulation of gene expression; however, the mechanism of the effect of CypA on RARE-mediated regulation of gene expression requires more detail. Nevertheless, RNA interference clearly reveals that CypA is required for RA-induced neuronal differentiation in p19 EC cells. Using a simplified vector system, we have generated stable transfectants that express siRNAs responsible for the sustained knockdown of a specific target. Use of this siRNA system may ultimately lead to the production of transgenic animals for the study of neurogenesis. In summary, the powerful tool we have developed to stably suppress CypA expression in p19 cells also can be applied to a variety of biological systems. Specifically, the knockdown-and- rescue system has not only revealed the novel function of CypA, which is required for RA-induced neuronal differentiation in p19 EC cells, it has also demonstrated that this system can be applied in a temporal fashion for the regulation of gene expression in a desired manner. This system also opens new avenues for gene therapy. The design of RNA interfering vectors that target disease-derived transcripts with a point mutation, such as mutant RAS or TP53 oncogenes, can be followed by rescue to form a “wild-type protein” that functions as a wild-type regulatory protein in normal cellular function.

The phase II detoxication enzyme, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1; EC 1.6.99.2) also known as quinone reductase (QR) is well established to undergo transcriptional activation following oltipraz treatment of colon cancer cells in culture. Promoter analysis of the QR gene in oltipraztreated cells reveals the involvement of both the AP-1 and NF-κB elements in the response. The emerging role of NF-κB in cell survival prompted a fuller analysis of effects of oltipraz on this pathway. Oltipraz treatment of both HCT116 and HT29 cells results in the induction of proteins involved in both pathways of NF-κB activation, including p65, IκB kinase α (IKKα), IκB kinase β (IKKβ), and NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). IκBα total protein levels were unchanged, but phosphorylation of the inhibitor was also induced in both lines. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis confirmed induction of protein binding to a consensus NF-κB element, and transcriptional activation was further confirmed using a reporter construct. Transcriptional activation of QR was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by dominant-negative NF-κB in both cell lines. The molecular mechanism that triggers IKK activation in response to oltipraz was also examined using inhibitory constructs of NIK and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3). We found that both MEKK3 and NIK exert effects on IKKα/β activation, but through different pathways. Furthermore, the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) was found to interact strongly with MEKK3 during oltipraz-induced NF-κB signaling, implying a role for tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling in the action of oltipraz. These results implicate a novel signaling pathway for the action of oltipraz in QR gene regulation.

Novel candidate molecules with defined chemopreventive mechanisms are needed. Oltipraz is a synthetic dithiolethione with experimental support for its role as a chemoprevention agent. Dithiolethiones are constituents of the Brassica family of green leafy vegetables, high consumption of which has been shown to lower cancer risk (5Steinmetz K.A. Potter J.D.

Cruciferous vegetables of the Brassica family, such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, appear to be most effective in this regard (7Verhoeven D.T. Goldbohm R.A. van Poppel G.

Studies in various models of carcinogenesis have shown protection by oltipraz from the induction of cancers in skin, breast bladder, lung, colon, pancreas, stomach, and liver (11Clapper M.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Clinical trials have established that induction of detoxication pathways can be achieved at tolerable doses of oltipraz (12Szarka C.E. Yao K.S. Pfeiffer G.R. Balshem A.M. Litwin S. Frucht H. Goosenberg E.B. Engstrom P.F. Clapper M.L. O'Dwyer P.J. Cancer Detect. Prev. 2001; 25: 352-361PubMed Google Scholar), though a large scale study in China produced mixed results (13Kensler T.W. He X. Otieno M. Egner P.A. Jacobson L.P. Chen B. Wang J.S. Zhu Y.R. Zhang B.C. Wang J.B. Wu Y. Zhang Q.N. Qian G.S. Kuang S.Y. Fang X. Li Y.F. Yu L.Y. Prochaska H.J. Davidson N.E. Gordon G.B. Gorman M.B. Zarba A. Enger C. Munoz A. Helzlsouer K.J. et al.Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1998; 7: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, doses that produce pharmacological activity are also associated with some skin and neurological toxicity that limit the therapeutic potential of the agent (14Benson 3rd. A.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 17F: 278-291Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is critical therefore to understand the mechanism of chemoprevention by oltipraz so that targets for this activity can be identified, and candidate molecules with an improved toxicity profile tested against them. We have previously examined the effects of oltipraz on regulation of detoxication enzymes, including glutathione transferases and quinone reductase (15O'Dwyer P.J. Clayton M. Halbherr T. Myers C.B. Yao K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 783-791PubMed Google Scholar). We also have reported that transcriptional regulation of the QR 2The abbreviations used are: QR, quinone reductase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IKKα, IκB kinase α; IKKβ, IκB kinase β; NIK, NF-κB inducing kinase; MEKK3, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 3; RIP, receptor-interacting protein; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNF-R1, TNF receptor 1; IκBSR, IκB superrepressor; dnNIK, dominant-negative NIK; CAT, chloramphenicolacetyltransferase; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; nt, nucleotide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TRADD, TNF receptor-associated death domain; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HA, hemagglutinin. gene involves the stimulation by oltipraz of a number of transcription factors, including activating protein-1 (AP-1), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) (16Yao K.S. O'Dwyer P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Yao K.S. O'Dwyer P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although NF-κB alone seems to account for only 20–30% of QR promoter activity revealed by mutational analysis, NF-κB is responsible for a proportion of the immediate response on the QR gene promoter, and it is of interest based on the pleiotropic range of cells and promoters in which it is active. In addition, the anti-apoptotic role of NF-κB in many transformed cells may have implications for its potential role in chemoprevention. The NF-κB family of transcription factors were identified as regulators of genes involved in coordinating immune responses, and subsequently found to be active in other cell types. NF-κB is composed of homo-and heterodimers of five members of the Rel family including RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1 (p50), and NF-κB2 (p52). Two mechanisms for their activation have been described. In one, NF-κB proteins are present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form, bound by inhibitor molecules that include IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ. In the second, the inactive precursor forms of p50 and p52, p105 and p100 respectively are present unassociated with the inhibitors (18Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB may be triggered by a signaling cascade that results in phosphorylation of IκB by an IκB kinase (IKK) complex composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ, the activity of which results in the release and subsequent proteasomal degradation of IκB (19Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). In the alternative pathway, partial degradation of the p100 precursor by proteolysis releases active p52, which permits translocation to the nucleus of preformed p52-RelB complexes (20Betts J.C. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6363-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Heusch M. Lin L. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6201-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for the activation of p100 proteolysis is NIK (22Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), which activates IKKα, which in turn acts on p100 to direct it toward proteasomal processing and release of p52 (23Regnier C.H.

This alternative pathway has shown to be involved in signaling cascades that act in the development, organization, and function of lymphoid tissue. The molecular mechanism(s) by which the IKK complex is activated is an active area of current investigation. There are several potential upstream IKK kinases, including MEKK1 (25Lee F.S. Peters R.T.

Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), all of which have been shown to phosphorylate and activate IKK directly in vitro. A recent study confirmed that MEKK3 is essential for TNF-induced NF-κB activation (30Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The authors found that MEKK3 acted downstream of TRAF2 and receptor-interacting protein (RIP). In addition, MEKK3 was found to interact with RIP physically (37Elewaut D. DiDonato J.A. Kim J.M. Truong F. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1457-1466PubMed Google Scholar). To pursue further the role of NF-κB in QR gene regulation and more broadly in chemoprevention, we investigated the effects of oltipraz treatment on the upstream events that signal NF-κB transactivation. We report here that NF-κB activation by oltipraz in colon cancer cells occurs primarily by activation of MEKK3 followed by IKKα and IKKβ activation. Evidence of activation of NIK was also demonstrated, but signaling through p100 did not appear to be important. A possible role for TNF-α receptor signaling in mediating the pharmacological effect is suggested by the involvement of the RIP-MEKK3 complex in the response.

Cell Lines and Cell Treatments—HT29 and HCT116 colon adenocarcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish 24 h prior to 100 μm oltipraz and 0.02% Me2SO treatment (solvent control). The cells were exposed to oltipraz for 24 h, after which oltipraz was removed, and fresh medium added for further incubation. Total RNA or protein extracts were isolated from the cells at various times (0, 6, 24, 30, and 48 h). Cytosolic and Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear and cytosolic proteins were prepared using CelLytic™ NuCLEAR™ Extraction Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's manual. Briefly, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in conical centrifuge tubes.

The resuspended cells were centrifuged at 420 × g for 5 min 4 °C. The pellet was again resuspended with the lysis buffer and disrupted using a glass tissue homogenizer. The disrupted cells were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant saved as a cytosolic extract.

A blocking monoclonal antibody against TNF-R1 (clone 55R-170) was purchased fromR&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). HCT116 cells were incubated with TNF-R1 blocking antibody (25 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to TNF-α (100 ng/ml) or oltipraz (100 μm) treatment for 1 or 24 h, respectively. Following treatments, the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting with specific antibodies against TRADD, RIP, TRAF2, and IKKβ. TRADD and TRAF2 antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (15 μg) was electrophoresed, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and hybridized to a 1.2-kb human quinone reductase probe (32Yao K.S. Godwin A.K. Johnson C. O'Dwyer P.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1731-1736PubMed Google Scholar) at 65 °C. Membranes were washed for 1 h in 2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.5% SDS and exposed to autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The NF-κB site in the human quinone reductase promoter region, 5′-TCAGTACAGACGGGGCTTCACCAGGTTGGCCAG-3′ was first labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (Promega). 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with gel shift binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 0.25 μg/μl poly(dI:dC), 20% glycerol) for 10 min. The NF-κB or control Oct-1 probe was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (greater than 50,000 cpm/ml), and samples were incubated for a further 20 min at room temperature. The samples were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 200 V. The gels were dried and developed by autoradiography. Transfection and Reporter Gene Analysis—HT29 and HCT116 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells per well in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were transfected using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of pNF-κB-Luc or 1 μg of pTAL-Luc, in combination with 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV vector (Promega). pRL-CMV directs expression of Renilla luciferase under a constitutive promoter and was used as an internal control to normalize the obtained NF-κB values. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with 100 μm oltipraz as above, lysed, and subjected to the luciferase assay using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega) on the TD20/20 Luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA). The relative light units (RLUs) were calculated as the ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase luminescence. Nonspecific luciferase activation was determined in parallel experiments with pTAL-Luc (control vector) and deducted. Normalized luciferase activities are presented as fold induction relative to the activity obtained from the Me2SO control group. The cells were transfected as above with 1 μg of pDTD890-CAT or 1 μg of its control vector (pCAT-Basic vector) in a combination with 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-gal. CAT protein produced was determined using the CAT-ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions on an ELx 800 Universal Microplate Reader (BIO-TEK, INC). Nonspecific CAT activation was determined in parallel experiments with pCAT-Basic (control vector) and was deducted. The transfection efficiency between samples was corrected with values of β-galactosidase expression measured by the β-gal-ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science). Normalized CAT activities were presented as fold induction relative to the activity obtained from the Me2SO control group. All reporter gene experiments were performed three times in triplicate. Construction of siRNA-MEKK3 and Transfection—Two DNA oligonucleotides (53–61 nt in size) were designed to produce 19-nt siRNAs. In the forward oligonucleotide, the 19-nt sense siRNA sequence is linked to the reverse complementary antisense siRNA sequence by a short spacer. In the reverse oligonucleotide, 4-nt overhangs to the EcoRI and ApaI restriction sites were added to the 5′- and 3′-end of the 54-nt sequence complementary to the forward oligonucleotide, respectively. The sequences for the bodies of siRNAs for MEKK3 were taken from GenBank™ accession number U78876 (nucleotides 416–434). Two oligonucleotides were mixed in equimolar amounts, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, then gradually cooled to room temperature in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The annealed siRNA insert was subcloned into the EcoRI and ApaI restriction sites of pSilencer 1.0-U6 vector (Ambion, Austin, TX). 5 μg of siRNA-MEKK3 plasmid and its control plasmid (pSilencer 1.0-U6) were transfected into HCT116 cells in 100-mm dishes (5 × 105) for protein extraction. For luciferase activity, the cells (5 × 104) were co-transfected with 1 μg of siRNA-MEKK3 plasmid or pNF-κB-Luc or the respective empty expression vectors (pSilencer 1.0-U6 or pTAL-Luc), in combination with 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV vector (Promega). The luciferase activity was analyzed as described above and all transfection experiments were performed three times in triplicate. Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—For immunoprecipitation assays, HCT116 cells (5 × 105) were treated with 100 μm oltipraz for 24-48 h and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 500 μg of protein extracts in each sample were precipitated with 2 μg of anti-RIP antibody (obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories) and further incubated with protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by Western blotting. Endogenous IKK was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-IKKα and anti-IKKβ antibody and an in vitro kinase assay performed by incubating them at 30 °C for 30 min in a reaction buffer containing 1 μg of GST-IκBα-(1–317) as substrate (obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm cold ATP in the kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm γ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). After the kinase reaction was stopped by adding 2× SDS sample buffer, phosphorylation of IκBα was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To monitor IKKα/β protein content in each kinase reaction, Western blotting was done on the same membrane using anti-IKKα/β antibodies. Oltipraz Induces NF-κB Signaling Pathways—Although most of the individual regulatory elements (including AP-1 and NF-κB binding sites) have been identified in the QR promoter region (31Yao K.S. Hageboutros A. Ford P. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 422-430PubMed Google Scholar, 33Li Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the particular signaling cascades involved in its regulation have yet to be described. A few reports have defined the upstream signals for detoxication enzyme activation upon treatment with dietary components such as isothiocyanates (34Wilhelm D. Bender K. Knebel A. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 35Patten E.J. DeLong M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In our previous work we found that NF-κB is one of the key transcription factors involved in quinone reductase gene regulation by oltipraz (16Yao K.S. O'Dwyer P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Yao K.S. Hageboutros A. Ford P. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 422-430PubMed Google Scholar), though the upstream signaling events leading to NF-κB activation have not been described. To analyze the basis for NF-κB activation, we investigated the expression of key proteins involved in its activation pathway. Increases in the cellular content of p65, p50, IKKα, and IKKβ occurred in a time-dependent manner following exposure to 100 μm oltipraz in both HT29 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 1). IκBα degradation was not observed, but phosphorylation of IκBα was markedly increased in a time-dependent manner. This finding is consistent with previous reports suggesting that incomplete degradation of IκBα is sufficient for NF-κB activation in certain types of colon epithelial cells including HT29 cells (36Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar, 37Elewaut D. DiDonato J.A. Kim J.M. Truong F. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1457-1466PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the functional status of NF-κB protein complexes induced by oltipraz, we performed EMSA assays. The binding activity on the NF-κB binding site in the regulatory region of QR was increased by oltipraz in both cell lines (Fig. 2, top panel). The binding activities gradually increased from 6 to 48 h post-treatment. No effect of oltipraz was observed on binding to the Oct-1 element (Fig. 2, lower panel). To confirm transcriptional activation of the NF-κB element in QR by oltipraz, we conducted a transfection experiment using a reporter construct containing the NF-κB element found in the regulatory region of the human QR gene (Fig. 3A). NF-κB activation was significantly induced in both HT29 and HCT116 cells, with minor differences between them in the degree of the response. To provide further functional evidence for NF-κB involvement in oltipraz-induced signaling, we used a dominant-negative mutant of NF-κB(IκBSR, IκB superrepressor) and a dominant-negative mutant of the upstream kinase, dnNIK (dominant-negative NIK). IκBSR cannot be phosphorylated and therefore precludes degradation of IκB. dnNIK, is a kinase-inactive mutant of NIK that lacks the two lysine residues in its catalytic domain (NIKKK429–430AA), and so behaves as a dominant-negative inhibitor to suppress NF-κB activity. HCT116 cells were co-transfected with the pNF-κB-Luc vector together with various concentrations of IκBSR or dnNIK or its empty expression vector, pcDNA3.1. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with 100 μm oltipraz for an additional 24 h and analyzed for luciferase activity. Oltipraz-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity was decreased by IκBSR and dnNIK in a dose-dependent manner, and 1 μg of IκBSR or dnNIK completely abrogated the effect of oltipraz on NF-κB activation in HCT116 cells (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results confirm that oltipraz clearly induces NF-κB signaling in colon cancer cells, and together with our previous data (16Yao K.S. O'Dwyer P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Yao K.S. Hageboutros A. Ford P. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 422-430PubMed Google Scholar), show that the pathway is an important component in induction of QR detoxication activity in these cells.Fig. 2Oltipraz increases NF-κB binding activities. Nuclear protein was extracted from the cells (5 × 105) treated with Me2SO (0 control) or 100 h μm oltipraz for 6, 24, 48 h in HT29 and HCT116 cells. 10 μg of nuclear extract from each sample was used for EMSA using either NF-κB (top panel) or Oct-1 (lower panel) oligonucleotide as probes. Specific anti-p65 antibody was added to the reaction mixtures of 24 h-treated cells prior to incubation with the labeled probe (lanes 6 and 12). A competition experiment was also performed with a 100-molar excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide (lanes 5 and 11).

https://openalex.org/W2063612002,"The early B-cell factor (EBF)-associated zinc-finger protein (EBFAZ) binds to and negatively regulates EBF, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor required for B-cell lineage commitment and development of the olfactory epithelium. It also binds to SMA- and MAD-related protein 1 (SMAD1) and SMAD4 in response to bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) signaling. It is highly related to ecotropic viral integration site 3 (EVI3), a protein that, like EBFAZ, contains 30 Krüppel-like zinc-finger repeats. In previous studies, we showed that Evi3 is a frequent target of retroviral integration in AKXD27 B-cell lymphomas. Here, we show that EBFAZ is also a frequent target. Integrations at Ebfaz and Evi3 are mutually exclusive, suggesting that they function in the same tumor pathway. Lymphomas with integrations at Ebfaz or Evi3 express the pre-B-cell-specific marker immunoglobulin lambda chain 5, and contain immunoglobulin heavy-chain rearrangements, suggesting that they are blocked at an early B-cell stage. Unlike Evi3, which is expressed at low levels in normal B cells, or Ebfaz, which is not expressed in B cells, both genes are highly expressed following viral integration. Collectively, our results suggest that ectopic expression of Ebfaz can substitute for the upregulated expression of Evi3 in B-cell disease and highlight the importance of this gene family in hematopoietic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2029993107,"The transcription factors STAT5A and STAT5B (STAT: signal transducer and activator of transcription) play a major role in the signaling events elicited by a number of growth factor and cytokine receptors. In this work, we aimed to investigate the role of STAT5 in human precursor B cell survival by introducing dominant-negative (DN) forms of STAT5A or STAT5B in the 697 pre-B cell line. All clones expressing DN forms of either transcription factor exhibited a higher spontaneous apoptotic rate that was massively enhanced upon interleukin-7 (IL-7) stimulation. This was associated with caspase 8 cleavage, mitochondrial transmembrane potential disruption and caspase 3 activation. However, the DN forms of STAT5 did not alter the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-x, Bim, A1 and Mcl1 proteins in IL-7-stimulated cells. The pancaspase inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromylmethyl ketone partially suppressed IL-7-mediated mitochondrial transmembrane potential disruption and cell death, suggesting that IL-7 induced the death of DN STAT5 expressing 697 cells through caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms that both require mitochondrial activation."

The gene, COL7A1, is activated by TGF-β via Smad transcription factors in cooperation with AP1. Here we report a previously unsuspected level of complexity in this regulatory process. We provide evidence that TGF-β may activate the COL7A1 promoter by two distinct inputs operating through a common region of the promoter. One input is provided by TGF-β-induced Smad complexes via two Smad binding elements that function redundantly depending on the cell type. The second input is provided by relieving the COL7A1 promoter from chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF)-mediated transcriptional repression. We identified COUP-TFI and -TFII as factors that bind to the TGF-β-responsive region of the COL7A1 promoter in an expression library screening. COUP-TFs bind to a site between the two Smad binding elements independently of Smad or AP1 and repress the basal and TGF-β-stimulated activities of this promoter. We provide evidence that endogenous COUP-TF activity represses the COL7A1 promoter. Furthermore, we show that TGF-β addition causes a rapid and profound down-regulation of COUP-TF expression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts.

Type VII collagen belongs to an extensive family of closely related proteins involved in cell anchoring to extracellular matrix and cartilage formation.

Although a general signal transduction pathway for transcriptional regulation by TGF-β has been established, little is known about the specific mechanisms involved in the COL7A1 gene response. Activated TGF-β receptors directly phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3, inducing their accumulation in the nucleus to regulate the expression of a large set of genes (14Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4795) Google Scholar). Receptor-phosphorylated Smads associate with Smad4, which in most instances is indispensable for transcriptional regulation. Smad proteins recognize the sequence CAGAC, commonly referred to as the Smad binding element (SBE). To regulate specific target genes, however, activated Smad complexes must additionally interact or functionally cooperate with other transcription factors. In the case of COL7A1 activation by TGF-β, previous studies have shown the involvement of Smad and AP1 transcription factors (9Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Kon A. de Caestecker M.P. Uitto J.

Mutation of this element inhibits the activation of the COL7A1 promoter by TGF-β in fibroblasts (9Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Kon A. de Caestecker M.P. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14769-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, this SBE is not required for this response in keratinocytes (11Naso M. Uitto J. Klement J.F. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1469-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) suggesting that the cellular context and other complexities play an important role in the regulation of COL7A1 expression by TGF-β. To address these questions, we investigated the role of various elements present in the TGF-β-responsive region of the COL7A1 promoter in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. We report the existence of a second Smad binding site in the COL7A1 promoter that provides cell type-dependent redundancy, clarifying previous controversies. Our results also suggest that COL7A1 activation in response to TGF-β involves not only activation by a Smad complex but also the relief of inhibition by COUP-TF transcriptional repressors. Cell Lines—HaCaT, NIH 3T3, and COS1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS (Invitrogen). Plasmids—The human COL7A1 promoter fragment spanning from -496 to +92 was generated by PCR, using human DNA as template and oligonucleotides primers with flanking SalI/HindIII sites. This fragment was cloned into the XhoI/HindIII sites of the low basal activity luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-basic (Promega). Mutant forms of the wild type promoter were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides carrying the indicated mutations. FLAG-tagged versions of the COUP-TFI and -TFII cDNAs were generated and cloned into the pCMV5 vector. FLAG-tagged COUP-Dim was generated by PCR, amplifying the C-terminal region of COUP-TFII (residues 300-414) comprising the dimerization domain, and was cloned into the pCMV5 vector. COS1 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged COUP-TFI or -TFII or COUP-Dim using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transcriptional Assays—HaCaT cells were transfected by using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (15Iavarone A. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 387: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE or the calcium-phosphate precipitation method. Briefly, 3 μg of plasmid DNA were diluted in 250 μl of 2 m CaCl2. This solution was mixed with 250 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (50 mm HEPES, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, to final pH 7.1). 80-μl aliquots of this precipitate were overlaid on wells of a 12-well dish containing 1 ml of freshly added Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS. After transfection cells were incubated in medium containing 10% FBS for 6-8 h. The medium was changed to 0.2% FBS, and cells were incubated with 100 pm TGF-β for 20-24 h. Cell lysates were then subjected to luciferase assays (Promega) in a Berthold luminometer (Nashua, NH). A cytomegalovirus promoter Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) was used as a control to normalize the transfection efficiency and was assayed as described previously (16Calonge M.J. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33637-33643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Precipitation Assays—Cells were treated with TGF-β for 1 h under normal culture conditions and then lysed by sonication in buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Cell debris was removed by 5-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Cell extracts were incubated for 16 h with 1 μg of biotinylated double-strand oligonucleotide corresponding to the wild type or mutant forms of the COL7A1 -495/-431 promoter region. DNA-bound proteins were collected with streptavidin-agarose beads for 1 h, washed with lysis buffer, separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and identified by Western blotting. RNA Assays—Exponentially growing cells were incubated with 100 pm TGF-β for the indicated time. Cells were harvested, and total RNA was extracted by using Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) RNeasy minikit. 100 mg of total RNA was then used to obtain poly(A) RNA using a Clontech kit. The poly(A) RNA obtained was run on parallel denaturing gel and subjected to Northern analysis. Blots were probed with probes corresponding to human or mouse COL7A1, actin, COUP-TFI, or COUP-TFII. Yeast One-hybrid Screening—A NIH 3T3 cDNA library in the pGAD10 fusion vector (Clontech), which provides an N-terminal GAL4 fusion transcriptional activation domain, was transformed into a yeast strain bearing four consecutive copies of the -495/-431 region of the COL7A1 promoter upstream of both HIS3 and a LacZ reporter gene. cDNA clones that allowed growth in -His plates and gave a strong β-galactosidase activity in a colony lift assay were identified as positive. Role of Two Smad Binding Elements in the COL7A1 Promoter—To investigate the transcriptional activation of COL7A1 by TGF-β, we generated luciferase reporter constructs driven by the -496/+92 region of the human COL7A1 (9Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Kon A. de Caestecker M.P. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14769-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Versions of this promoter were generated containing mutations that target the previously described SBE site (9Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Kon A. de Caestecker M.P. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14769-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which we refer to as 5′-SBE, and an adjacent AP1 site (10Verrecchia F. Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3332-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) as well as other sites in this region that are conserved in the human and mouse genes (Fig. 1A). TGF-β addition strongly stimulated the expression of the wild type COL7A1 promoter in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and this response was diminished by mutations targeting the 5′-SBE (Fig. 1B). These results are in full agreement with those reported in human dermal fibroblasts (9Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Kon A. de Caestecker M.P. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14769-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). TGF-β also stimulated the expression of the wild type COL7A1 promoter in HaCaT human skin keratinocytes. Surprisingly, however, this response was not diminished by mutations targeting the 5′-SBE (Fig. 1B). Several lines of evidence suggested that this tolerance for a mutant 5′-SBE in HaCaT keratinocytes reflected a genuine difference between fibroblasts and keratinocytes and not an anomaly of the HaCaT cell line. HaCaT cells are well characterized in terms of their responsiveness to TGF-β (17Kang Y. Chen C.R. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Further, we verified that TGF-β stimulates the expression of the endogenous COL7A1 gene at the mRNA level (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the lack of an effect of mutations in this SBE has been reported recently in mouse keratinocytes as well (11Naso M. Uitto J. Klement J.F. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1469-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Searching for a possible basis for this difference between keratinocytes and fibroblasts, we noticed a perfect inverted SBE (3′-SBE) ∼50 base pairs downstream of the 5′-SBE (Fig. 1A). This site was not investigated in previous studies (9Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Kon A. de Caestecker M.P. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14769-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Verrecchia F. Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3332-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 11Naso M. Uitto J. Klement J.F. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 1469-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of mutating this site alone or in combination with the 5′-SBE. Mutation of the 3′-SBE affected the response of the COL7A1 promoter to TGF-β in a manner similar to mutation of the 5′-SBE site, as the 3′-SBE mutations diminished the TGF-β response in fibroblasts but not in keratinocytes (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, the simultaneous mutation of the 5′-SBE and 3′-SBE sites completely eliminated the TGF-β response not only in fibroblasts but also in keratinocytes (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that the 5′-SBE and 3′-SBE in the COL7A1 promoter are important for the TGF-β response in both cell types, acting redundantly in keratinocytes but not in fibroblasts. Cell Type-dependent Cooperation with AP1—AP1 sites and the Fos-Jun complexes that recognize these sites have been shown to play a role in certain TGF-β gene responses, including the COL7A1 response (10Verrecchia F. Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3332-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). An AP1 site that is adjacent to the 5′-SBE (see Fig. 1A) has been implicated in the TGF-β response of the COL7A1 promoter in fibroblasts (10Verrecchia F. Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3332-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We found that the requirement of this site for the TGF-β response is cell type-dependent. Mutation of the AP1 site had no effect on the TGF-β response of the COL7A1 promoter in the keratinocytes, but it inhibited this response in fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). To investigate the interaction of endogenous Smad and AP1 proteins with these sites in the COL7A1 promoter, we conducted DNA-mediated precipitation assays using biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the human COL7A1 -495/-431 promoter region. Extracts from control and TGF-β-treated cells were incubated with wild type or mutant probes, and bound complexes were collected using streptavidin-agarose beads. Proteins of interest were investigated by Western immunoblotting of these precipitates using specific antibodies. Both HaCaT and NIH 3T3 cells showed a TGF-β-dependent formation of a Smad complex capable of binding to the wild type COL7A1 probe, as determined using anti-Smad4 antibody (Fig. 2). Binding of this complex to the probe was not affected by mutations that disrupt the AP1 site. Mutation of the 5′-SBE or the 3′-SBE diminished the TGF-β-dependent binding of Smad4, and a combination of these mutations essentially eliminated Smad4 binding to the probe (Fig. 2). To investigate the binding of AP1 complexes to these probes, we used antibodies that cross-react with various members of the Jun family. The wild type COL7A1 probe bound endogenous Jun proteins, and the level of binding was similar in control cells and TGF-β-treated cells (Fig. 2). Mutation of either or both SBE sites did not affect the binding of Jun proteins to the probe, whereas mutation of the AP1 site completely prevented Jun binding (Fig. 2). Collectively these results suggest that Smad and AP1 complexes may bind to the SBE and AP1 sites in the COL7A1 promoter independently of each other, and this binding is dependent on TGF-β stimulation in the case of the Smad site but independent in the case of the AP1 site. Furthermore, this protein binding behavior was the same regardless of whether the SBE sites were functionally redundant in keratinocytes or were non-redundant and cooperative with AP1 in fibroblasts. COUP-TF Binding to the TGF-β Regulatory Region of the COL7A1 Promoter—To determine whether additional factors may control the COL7A1 response to TGF-β, we tested the role of other segments in this region that are conserved in the human and mouse genes. We generated a reporter construct containing mutations in a conserved segment around position -450 (-450 conserved box; Fig. 1A). This construct had much higher basal activity than the wild type construct in transcriptional assays in keratinocytes (Fig. 3A). The activity of this construct was further increased by TGF-β, suggesting that a repressor factor may bind to this region under basal conditions and may determine the overall responsiveness of the COL7A1 promoter to TGF-β. To identify factors that may regulate COL7A1 from the -495/-431 promoter region, we screened a cDNA expression library for gene products that bind to this region. To this end, we generated a yeast strain expressing HIS3 and LacZ under the control of four copies of this promoter region and then used these cells to screen a mouse fibroblast cDNA library fused to the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain. In this approach, cDNAs encoding GAL4 fusion proteins that bind to the -495/-431 promoter region would confer HIS3 phenotype and activate LacZ expression. Only four cDNA clones were isolated that fulfilled these criteria. One of these cDNAs encoded the full-length COUP-TFI (also known as EAR3), and the other three encoded the full-length COUP-TFII (also known as ARP-1) (Fig. 3B). COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII are closely related orphan members of the nuclear/steroid receptor family (18Qiu Y. Krishnan V. Pereira F.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Cooney A.J. Lee C.T. Lin S.C. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). They consist of an N-terminal DNA binding domain containing two zinc finger motifs and a C-terminal transcription regulatory domain containing a dimerization region (Fig. 3B). COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII bind to DNA as dimers that recognize two direct TGACC(C/T) repeats separated by a single base pair spacer (20Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). COUP-TFI and -TFII are thought to act primarily as transcriptional repressors (20Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 21Shibata H. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol.

Examination of the COL7A1 -495/-431 region revealed that the sequence of the -450 conserved box is similar to the COUP-TF consensus binding sequence (Fig. 3C). As mutations of the -450 conserved box augmented the activity of the COL7A1 promoter, we hypothesized that this effect might be due to a loss of endogenous COUP-TF binding to this region. To determine whether this region can bind COUP-TF proteins, we carried out DNA precipitation assays using wild type and mutant biotinylated COL7A1 -495/-431 oligonucleotide probes (Fig. 3C). A FLAG-tagged COUP-TFII construct expressed in COS cells bound to the wild type probe but not to two different probes that contain mutations in the -450 conserved box (Fig. 3D). COUP-TFII binding to the wild type promoter was not affected by cell treatment with TGF-β and was not disrupted by SBE or AP1 site mutations that block the binding of Smad or Jun, respectively (Fig. 3E). We looked for, but could not find, evidence of Smad3 or Smad4 binding to COUP-TFI or COUPTFII. In extracts from cells overexpressing Smads and COUPTFs, these proteins neither enhanced nor interfered with the binding of each other to the COL7A1 -495/-431 probe (data not shown). These results suggest that the -450 conserved box is a COUP-TF site that binds COUP-TF proteins independently of Smad and AP1. Down-regulation of COUP-TF Expression by TGF-β—Interestingly, GeneChip transcriptomic profiling data in HaCaT cells revealed that TGF-β treatment decreases the level of COUP-TFII transcripts (17Kang Y. Chen C.R. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). We verified by Northern analysis that TGF-β addition causes a rapid and profound decrease in the level of COUP-TFII mRNA in HaCaT and NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 4). COUP-TFI expression, which was present in NIH 3T3 cells but barely detectable in HaCaT cells, was also inhibited by TGF-β (Fig. 4). The down-regulation of COUP-TFII by TGF-β in HaCaT cells was rapid (t½ ≤ 2 h; Fig. 4) and preceded the up-regulation of COL7A1 expression (t½ = 4 h; refer to Fig. 1C). Thus, TGF-β action down-regulates the expression of a putative COL7A1 repressor. Repression of COL7A1 Promoter by COUP-TF—We investigated whether COUP-TFs can act as repressors of the COL7A1 promoter in transfected HaCaT cells. Indeed, both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII markedly inhibited the basal activity of the wild type COL7A1 promoter as well as its activation by TGF-β (Fig. 5A). The promoter construct containing mutations in the -450 conserved box (the COUP-TF binding element) was not only hyperactive under basal conditions but also completely resistant to inhibition by exogenous COUP-TFI or COUP-TFII (Fig. 5A). As no anti-COUP-TF antibodies could be obtained for these studies, we resorted to alternative approaches to determine whether the COL7A1 promoter is sensitive to endogenous COUP-TFs. First, we mutated the COUP-TF binding region to bring this sequence closer to the optimal COUP-TF binding sequence (COUP+ mutant in Fig. 3C) (20Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). When tested in oligonucleotide precipitation assays, a COL7A1 probe containing this mutant sequence bound COUP-TFII with higher affinity than did the wild type probe (Fig. 5B). A COL7A1 promoter construct bearing this mutation showed a significantly decreased activity in HaCaT cells, which was suggestive of a response to endogenous COUP-TFs (Fig. 5C). Thus, the COUP+ mutation hypersensitizes the COL7A1 promoter to COUP-TF repression. To test further this hypothesis, we generated a FLAG-tagged mutant COUP-TF construct designed to inhibit the dimerization and thus the function of endogenous COUP-TFs. This construct, COUP-Dim, encodes the dimerization domain of COUP-TFII (Fig. 6A). The COUP-Dim product was able to completely inhibit the binding of COUP-TFII to the COL7A1 promoter (Fig. 6A), demonstrating that it can act as a dominant-negative construct. When tested in COL7A1 promoter activity assays, COUP-Dim increased the activity of this promoter while still allowing a further activation by TGF-β (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results suggest that the COL7A1 promoter is repressed by COUP-TF or a closely related factor in HaCaT cells. The ability of TGF-β to sharply decrease the expression of endogenous COUP-TFs in these cells while simultaneously inducing the formation of a COL7A1-activating Smad complex suggests that COL7A1 induction by TGF-β involves a combination of promoter activation and deinhibition inputs. The results of this work suggest that the activation of COL7A1 expression by TGF-β is a complex process involving two inputs (schematically summarized in Fig. 7). One input is provided by TGF-β-dependent Smad-transactivating factors and the other by the relief of COUP-TF-mediated transcriptional repression of the COL7A1 promoter. This complex regulatory process has several features that distinguish it from previously characterized TGF-β-regulated promoters. We provide evidence that regulation of the COL7A1 promoter by TGF-β-activated Smad factors occurs via two SBEs in the TGF-β-responsive region of this promoter. The SBE, or CAGAC sequence, is the best characterized of the various sequences implicated in DNA binding by signal-activated Smad factors (14Shi Y. Massagué J.

IntroductionDNA is susceptible to a number of lesions, such as those caused by chemicals, ionizing radiation, and ultraviolet light. Failure to repair DNA damage is thought to play a significant role in cancer and aging. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MD, molecular dynamics. is a universal DNA repair mechanism that recognizes and removes many structurally diverse DNA lesions. This system repairs the damage in the DNA by a three step mechanism: (i) recognition of the lesion, (ii) dual nicking (3′ and 5′) of the damaged strand around the altered site, and (iii) DNA synthesis and ligation to fill the 12-13-base gap. The NER system in eucaryotes is very complex and involves the action of at least 16 different polypeptides (1Mu D. Park C.H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2415-2418Google Scholar). On the contrary, in procaryotic organisms the NER mechanism involves only four specific proteins, UvrA, UvrB, UvrC, and UvrD (in addition to DNA polymerase and ligase). Despite the fact that the general mechanism of the UvrABCD system is known, many key issues remain unclear. The most important one is the determination of the structural characteristics of DNA lesions that trigger the repair system. The wide range of lesions that are recognized by the UvrABCD system suggests that the feature that induces repair is an alteration of the structural characteristics of the damaged DNA rather than a particular chemical structure of the damaging agent (2Sancar A.

Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 103-123Google Scholar). After the analysis of a large number of lesions that are substrates of the UvrABCD system, van Houten (3Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Google Scholar) classified them into six categories: (i) covalent damage, (ii) bulky substituents, (iii) localized unwinding, (iv) bending or kinking, (v) change in charge distribution at the damage site, and (vi) change in the dynamics of DNA. Whether or not one of these characteristics is enough to activate the repair system is unknown.Among the many natural and unnatural DNA lesions, oligonucleotides containing bulky groups have been studied extensively as possible substrates for DNA repair enzymes (5Reardon J.T.

However, the information on the effect of non-aromatic bulky adducts on the structure of the DNA is very limited. Cholesterol is one of the most interesting non-aromatic bulky groups. Although to our knowledge nucleotide-containing cholesterol derivatives do not occur naturally in living cells, cholesterol-modified nucleotides have been used extensively as model lesions in DNA repair studies since they lead to lesions that are efficiently recognized by the NER system (6Matsunaga T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1926-1934Google Scholar).In this paper we report the solution structure of a DNA decamer in which one cytosine residue has been substituted for the cholesterol-modified nucleotide shown in Fig. 1. This specific cholesterol derivative is particularly interesting since it has been shown that the two possible stereoisomers in the C1′ position of the modified nucleotide have different recognition features. Whereas DNAs containing both anomers are equally recognized by the bacterial UvrABCD system, only oligonucleo-tides with the α anomer derivative are efficiently excised (39Monaco V. van de Wetering K.I. Meeuwenoord N.J. van den Elst H.A. Stuivenberg H.R. Visse R. van der Kaaden J.C. Moolenaar G.F. Verhoeven E.E. Goosen N. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1999; 18: 1339-1341Google Scholar). In this study, two samples with pure stereochemistry in the C1′ position of the modified nucleotide have been investigated. The solution structure of a DNA decamer of sequence d(CCACXGGAAC)-d(GTTCCGGTGG), where X is the α or β anomer of the modified nucleotide, has been determined. The structure of the unmodified control duplex was obtained in a previous publication (40Soliva R. Monaco V. Gomez-Pinto I. Meeuwenoord N.J. Van Der Marel G.A. Van Boom J.H. Gonzalez C. Orozco M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2973-2985Google Scholar).In addition to their interest as models of DNA lesions, oligonucleotides containing cholesterol conjugates have interesting applications as antisense agents. It has been shown that oligonucleotides containing cholesterol adducts at the 3′-terminus are cytotoxic (41Zhou J.H. Pai B.S. Reed M.W. Gamper H.B. Lukhtanov E. Podyminogin M. Meyer Jr., R.B. Cheng Y.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5783-5787Google Scholar, 42Krieg A.M. Tonkinson J. Matson S. Zhao Q. Saxon M. Zhang L.M. Bhanja U. Yakubov L. Stein C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1048-1052Google Scholar). Conjugation of the cholesterol group increases the cellular uptake of the antisense oligonucleotide and improves its nuclease resistance (43Gamper H.B. Reed M.W. Cox T. Virosco J.S. Adams A.D. Gall A.A. Scholler J.K. Meyer Jr., R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 145-150Google Scholar). Finally it has been demonstrated that the addition of a cholesterol group at the 5′-end of self-complementary oligonucleotides increases the stability of the duplex, probably via better stacking interactions with the terminal base pairs (44Bleczinski C.F. Richert C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10889-10894Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSSynthesis—The synthesis 2V. Monaco, G. van der Marel, and J. H. van Boom, manuscript in preparation. of the modified oligonucleotide 5′-d(CCACXGGAAC)-3′ and of its complementary strand, 5′-d(GTTCCGGTGG)-3′, were performed on a Amersham Biosciences LKB Gene assembler special synthesizer using the phosphoramidite method. Standard protected 2′-deoxyribonucleoside phosphoramidites were purchased from PerSpective Biosystem and used as 0.1 m solution in dry acetonitrile (DNA synthesis grade, Biosolve Ltd., on molecular sieves 4 Å). The cholesterol-containing building blocks were obtained by condensation of 3-(5-cholesten-3β-yloxycarbonyl)propanolamine with 3′,5′-di-O-p-toluoyl-α-deoxyribofuranosyl chloride in the presence of silver aluminum silicate followed by further processing of the individual α and β anomers to give the respective phosphoramidites. Purification of the cholesterol-containing oligonucleotides was achieved via reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a LiChrosphere® RP18e column (10.00 × 250 mm, 5 μm particle size, Merck) installed on a BioCAD Vision work station (PerSeptive Biosystems). As an eluent, an appropriate gradient of CH3CN in 50 mm triethylammonium acetate was used with a flow of 5 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. The oligonucleotides were desalted on Sephadex® G-25 and finally transformed in the corresponding Na+ form by elution on a Dowex 50Wx4 column (Na+ form) and lyophilized.NMR Spectroscopy—The duplexes of the two stereochemically pure samples were prepared for NMR experiments by combining equimolar amounts of the modified oligonucleotide and its complementary strand in phosphate buffer. The stoichiometry for 1:1 duplex formation was determined by performing a titration of 1 strand with the other. Duplex formation was monitored by UV spectroscopy. Samples were suspended in 500 μl of either D2O or 9:1 H2O/D2O. The resulting buffer solution (10 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) was about 2 mm in duplex.All NMR spectra were acquired in a Bruker DMX spectrometer operating at 600 MHz and processed with the XWIN-NMR software. In the experiments in D2O, presaturation was used to suppress the residual H2O signal. A jump- and -return pulse sequence (45Plateau P. Güeron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Google Scholar) was employed to observe the rapidly exchanging protons in one-dimensional H2O experiments. NOESY (46Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Google Scholar) spectra in D2O were acquired with mixing times of 100, 200, and 300 ms. Total correlation (47Bax A. Davies D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) spectra were recorded with the standard MLEV-17 spin-lock sequence and a mixing time of 80 ms. In two-dimensional experiments in H2O, water suppression was achieved by including a WATERGATE (48Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Google Scholar) module in the pulse sequence before acquisition. 31P resonances were assigned from proton-detected heteronuclear correlation spectra (49Sklenar V. Miyashiro H. Zon G. Miles H.T. Bax A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 94-98Google Scholar). The spectral analysis program XEASY (50Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Google Scholar) was used for semiautomatic assignment of the NOESY cross-peaks and quantitative evaluation of the NOE intensities. NMR melting curves were determined by following the changes in chemical shifts of some well resolved resonances in one-dimensional spectra recorded at different temperatures. The curves were analyzed by fitting the data to a model based in a two-state equilibrium by using Microcal Origin 5.0 software.Experimental Constraints—Quantitative distance constraints were obtained from NOESY experiments by using a complete relaxation matrix analysis with the program MARDIGRAS (51Borgias B.A. James T.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 475-487Google Scholar). To avoid any possible bias coming from initial conditions and to estimate the error bounds in the interprotonic distances properly, different MARDIGRAS calculations were carried out with different initial models, mixing times, and correlation times. Standard A-and B-form duplexes were used as initial models, and three correlation times (1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 ns) were employed. Experimental intensities were recorded at three different mixing times (100, 200, and 300 ms) for non-exchangeable protons and at a single mixing time (200 ms) for labile protons. Final distances with their errors were determined by averaging upper and lower bounds in all individual runs. These constraints were incorporated into the AMBER potential energy by defining a flat-well potential term between the average upper and lower limits. A lower limit of 1.8 Å and a loose upper distance constraint of 5 Å were set in those distances where no quantitative analysis could be carried out, such as very weak intensities or cross-peaks involving labile protons.Sums of J-coupling constants involving H1′, H2′, and H2′′ protons were estimated from double quantum-filtered-correlation spectroscopy cross-peaks. The population of major S conformers was calculated from the sums of J-coupling constants, ∑1′ and ∑2′′, according to the expressions f s = (31.5 -∑ 2′′)/10.9 and f s = (∑ 1′ -9.8)/5.9, where f s is the population of S-type puckering. In those deoxyriboses where the population of S-type conformer is larger than 50%, torsion angle constraints were included. Because only the sums of coupling constants were estimated, loose values were set for the dihedral angle of the deoxyriboses (δ angle between 110° and 170°, ν1 between 5° and 65°, and ν2 between -65 and -50°).In addition to these experimentally derived constraints, Watson-Crick hydrogen bond restraints were used. Target values for distances and angles related to hydrogen bonds were set as described from crystallographic data. No backbone angle constraints were employed. Distance constraints with their corresponding error bounds were incorporated into the AMBER potential energy by defining a flat-well potential term.Structure Determination—Structures were calculated with the program DYANA 1.4 (52Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Google Scholar) and further refined with the SANDER module of the molecular dynamics package AMBER 5.0 (53Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell III, J.W. T.E.C. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Ferguson D.M. Radmer R.J. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER version 5. University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar). Initial DYANA calculations were carried out on the basis of qualitative distance constraints. The resulting structures were used as initial models in the complete relaxation matrix calculations to obtain accurate distance constraints, as described in the previous paragraph. The final structures resulting from DYANA calculations were taken as starting points for the AMBER refinement, consisting of an annealing protocol in vacuo followed by long trajectories where explicit solvent molecules are included. Thus, starting from 10 different conformations of each isomer, we performed 10 (×2) different annealing procedures in the gas phase using the protocol described elsewhere (40Soliva R. Monaco V. Gomez-Pinto I. Meeuwenoord N.J. Van Der Marel G.A. Van Boom J.H. Gonzalez C. Orozco M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2973-2985Google Scholar, 54Gomez-Pinto I. Marchan V. Gago F. Grandas A. Gonzalez C. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 40-49Google Scholar). The final structures were then hydrated by 3582 water molecules and 18 sodium counter ions. The structures were first equilibrated for 160 ps using our standard equilibration process (55Shields G.C. Laughton C.A. Orozco M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7463-7469Google Scholar). The final equilibrated structures were then subjected to 10 runs of 500-ps MD simulations in water using NMR restraints, periodic boundary conditions, and the Particle-Mesh-Ewald method (56Darden T.E. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Google Scholar). Simulations in water were performed in the isothermalisobaric ensemble (p = 1 atm., T = 298 K) using SHAKE in all atoms and a 2-femtosecond time step for integration of Newton's equations. MD-averaged structures were obtained by averaging the last 250 ps of individual trajectories and further relaxation of the structure. The same procedure was used to obtain a global MD-averaged structure, resulting from averaging 5 ns of independent MD trajectories for each isomer.The AMBER-98 force field (57Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Google Scholar) was used to describe the DNA, and the TIP3P model was used to describe water molecules (58Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Google Scholar). Parameters for some torsion angles of the cholesterol adduct were not included in the AMBER-98 force field. These parameters were determined by performing quantum mechanical calculations at the HF/-6 -31G(d) level in small suitable molecular models and fitting the resulting energies for different values of the torsion angle to the AMBER force field. This strategy has been implemented in the program PAPQMD (59Aleman C. Canela E.I. Franco R. Orozco M. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 664-674Google Scholar). The RESP method (60Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Google Scholar) was used to obtain electrostatic charges for the cholesterol derivative using HF/6 -31G(d) molecular electrostatic potentials.Analysis of Structures and Trajectories—Structural analysis of trajectories in solution was performed using analysis modules in AMBER as well as in-house programs. The average structures were determined from the last 250 ps of every trajectory in solution (i.e. 2.5 ns of sampling for each isomer). Due to the excellent convergence between the different trajectories (see “Results and Discussion”) the global average structures were determined using the last 250 ps of the 10 trajectories for each stereoisomer. Helical analysis of MD-averaged structures was carried out with the programs Curves (61Lavery R. Sklenar H. CURVES version 5.1. Laboratory of Theoretical Biochemistry CNRS, Paris1990Google Scholar) and MOLMOL (62Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Google Scholar). Molecular interaction potentials were computed for an O+ grid particle using Poisson-Boltzman molecular electrostatic potentials and the default options in the cMIP program (63Gelpí J.L. Kalko S. de la Cruz X. Barril X. Cirera J. Luque F.J. Orozco M. Proteins. 2001; 45: 428-437Google Scholar). Patterns of hydration were determined by integrating the water population during the last 250 ps of the trajectories. Canonical A- and B-form duplexes were built with the program Sybyl 6.9.DNA-UvrB Model Building—To understand the mechanisms triggering the activation of the UvrABCD-repairing system we have modeled the interaction of an undamaged and a damaged DNA with the UvrB protein (the key protein for damaged DNA recognition). The starting point of our model was derived from the structural superimposition between the Thermus thermophilus UvrB enzyme (64Machius M. Henry L. Palnitkar M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11717-11722Google Scholar) and the helicase domain NS3 of the hepatitis C virus complexed with an 8-mer oligonucleotide (65Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Google Scholar). The undamaged DNA-UvrB model was built by using the oligonucleotide in the helicase complex as a template for a 19-bp DNA duplex that was manually docked into the central groove of the structure of UvrB. The binding of the DNA to the enzyme was then optimized by simulated annealing using AMBER.Biophysical and biochemical data provide evidence indicating that a flexible β hairpin, rich in hydrophobic residues, is important for the stable binding of UvrB to DNA (35Moolenaar G.F. Hoglund L. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6140-6149Google Scholar, 64Machius M. Henry L. Palnitkar M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11717-11722Google Scholar, 66Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Google Scholar). Also, it has been shown that the UvrB binding to DNA is salt-resistant, suggesting that there are hydrophobic interactions between UvrB and the DNA (67Yeung A.T. Mattes W.B. Grossman L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2567-2582Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, we have designed a second model of the DNAUvrB interaction, where the β hairpin inserts between the two strands of the DNA helix, thereby locking a single strand between the β hairpin and the adjacent domain. Building such a model was a difficult task, taking into account the important steric hindrances of that system. As in the previous case, the relative position of the DNA and the enzyme was optimized through simulated annealing using AMBER, but in this case we consider the ends of the DNA to be constrained by a very high force constant to prevent the complete unwinding of the DNA.In the optimization of both models we used a simulated annealing protocol consisting of 20 annealing cycles combining MD runs at 1000 K with geometry optimization. Finally, the last structures obtained from the annealing process were used as input for a 5-ns-long MD simulation (constant temperature 298 K) with explicit counter ions and water molecules placed in a spherical drop centered around the active site (total simulation system around 20,000 atoms).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMelting Behavior—The melting behavior of the two duplexes is very similar. Melting temperatures were estimated by following the changes in the thymine methyl resonances (data not shown). Under the experimental conditions used in the NMR experiments, the two diastereoisomers melt at temperatures about 52 and 50 °C for the decamers containing the α and β anomers, respectively, whereas the control duplex melts at ∼62 °C. The cholesterol derivative produces a destabilization of around 10 °C in this decamer.It is worth mentioning that this destabilization effect is not observed when the cholesterol moiety is located at the termini of the DNA. Melting studies on self-complementary oligonucleotides containing other cholesterol derivatives show that the stability of the duplex is increased when the cholesterol is linked to the 5′ terminus of the DNA chain (44Bleczinski C.F. Richert C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10889-10894Google Scholar).NMR Assignment—Sequential assignments of exchangeable and non-exchangeable protons were obtained following standard methods. The H1′-base region of the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum in D2O is shown in Fig. 2 with the assignment pathways for the two strands. The pathway is interrupted at the modified nucleotide. All intra-nucleotide H1′-base NOEs are medium or weak, indicating that the glycosidic angles in all the nucleotides are in an anti conformation. Almost all resonances were identified with the exception of H5′/H5′′ protons, which show severe overlap (see Supplemental Tables S1 and S2). The lack of the pyrimidine base at position 5 produces considerable shifts in a number of signals, as can be seen, for example, in the aromatic proton of C15 (Fig. 2). Also, some signals, like the H1′ of C14 and C15, show significant line broadening.Fig. 2Region of the NOESY spectrum (250-ms mixing time) in D2O (100 mm NaCl, T = 5 °C, pH 7) of the α duplex of d(CCACXGGAAC)-(GTTCCGGTGG).

https://openalex.org/W2031703968,"Genomic stability is maintained by the surveillance and repair of DNA damage. Here, we describe a mechanism whereby repair of extrachromosomal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells can be accompanied by capture of genomic DNA fragments. The availability of the human genome sequence enabled us to characterize these inserts in cells from a normal individual and from a patient with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), deficient for the damage response kinase ATM and prone to genomic instability. We find AT cells exhibit insertions of human chromosomal DNA fragments in excess of 17 kb during DSB repair, whereas we detected no such genomic inserts in normal cells. However, the presence of simian virus 40 (SV40), used to transform these cell lines, resulted in capture of genomic DNA associated with sites of viral integration in both cell types. The genomic instability at sites of SV40 integration was exported to other sites of DNA damage, and acquisition of the viral origin of replication resulted in gene amplification through autonomous replication of the plasmid harbouring the repaired extrachromosomal DSB. Should this same phenomenon apply to the repair of chromsomal DSBs, genome rearrangements made possible via this DSB insertional repair pose risks to genomic integrity, and may contribute to tumorigenic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2134101192,"The Sin3 co-repressor acts as a protein scaffold to recruit transcription factors via its four highly homologous paired amphipathic helix (PAH) domains. PAH2 has been shown to interact strongly with the Sin3 interacting domain (SID) of the tumor suppressor Mad. This PAH2/Mad complex has been studied extensively by NMR, but the molecular determinants that dictate the specificity of interaction remain to be elucidated. To uncover residues that convey the specificity of interaction between PAH2 and Mad, PAH2 residues contacted by the Mad-SID were introduced into the PAH1 domain of mSin3b and tested for gain-of-interaction in vivo in a yeast two-hybrid setting and further confirmed in a cell-free system. This approach led to the identification of PAH2-Phe-7 as a critical residue. Stabilization of the interaction between PAH1-Phe-7 and the Mad-SID was achieved by introducing Val-14 and Gln-39 into PAH1. Substitution of PAH2 residues contacted by the Mad-SID with their respective residues in PAH1 corroborated and extended the critical role of Phe-7 and the stabilizing role of Val-14 and Gln-39. We conclude that Phe-7 is the critical determinant and provides the molecular specificity for the association between Sin3 and Mad in regulating cell growth and differentiation."
