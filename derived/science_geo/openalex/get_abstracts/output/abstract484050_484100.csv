https://openalex.org/W2009514456,"Experimental evidence revealed that obesity-associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is linked to changes in intestinal permeability and translocation of bacterial products to the liver. Hitherto, no reliable therapy is available except for weight reduction. Within this study, we examined the possible effect of the probiotic bacterial strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) as protective agent against experimental NAFLD in a mouse model.Experimental NAFLD was induced by a high-fructose diet over eight weeks in C57BL/J6 mice. Fructose was administered via the drinking water containing 30% fructose with or without LGG at a concentration resulting in approximately 5×10(7) colony forming units/g body weight. Mice were examined for changes in small intestinal microbiota, gut barrier function, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations in the portal vein, liver inflammation and fat accumulation in the liver.LGG increased beneficial bacteria in the distal small intestine. Moreover, LGG reduced duodenal IκB protein levels and restored the duodenal tight junction protein concentration. Portal LPS (P≤0.05) was reduced and tended to attenuate TNF-α, IL-8R and IL-1β mRNA expression in the liver feeding a high-fructose diet supplemented with LGG. Furthermore liver fat accumulation and portal alanine-aminotransferase concentrations (P≤0.05) were attenuated in mice fed the high-fructose diet and LGG.We show for the first time that LGG protects mice from NAFLD induced by a high-fructose diet. The underlying mechanisms of protection likely involve an increase of beneficial bacteria, restoration of gut barrier function and subsequent attenuation of liver inflammation and steatosis."
https://openalex.org/W2026315105,"Cyanobacteria possess the unique capacity to naturally produce hydrocarbons from fatty acids. Hydrocarbon compositions of thirty-two strains of cyanobacteria were characterized to reveal novel structural features and insights into hydrocarbon biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. This investigation revealed new double bond (2- and 3-heptadecene) and methyl group positions (3-, 4- and 5-methylheptadecane) for a variety of strains. Additionally, results from this study and literature reports indicate that hydrocarbon production is a universal phenomenon in cyanobacteria. All cyanobacteria possess the capacity to produce hydrocarbons from fatty acids yet not all accomplish this through the same metabolic pathway. One pathway comprises a two-step conversion of fatty acids first to fatty aldehydes and then alkanes that involves a fatty acyl ACP reductase (FAAR) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO). The second involves a polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway that first elongates the acyl chain followed by decarboxylation to produce a terminal alkene (olefin synthase, OLS). Sixty-one strains possessing the FAAR/ADO pathway and twelve strains possessing the OLS pathway were newly identified through bioinformatic analyses. Strains possessing the OLS pathway formed a cohesive phylogenetic clade with the exception of three Moorea strains and Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 6406 which may have acquired the OLS pathway via horizontal gene transfer. Hydrocarbon pathways were identified in one-hundred-forty-two strains of cyanobacteria over a broad phylogenetic range and there were no instances where both the FAAR/ADO and the OLS pathways were found together in the same genome, suggesting an unknown selective pressure maintains one or the other pathway, but not both."
https://openalex.org/W2068541829,"The transfer of novel genetic material into the genomes of bacterial viruses (phages) has been widely documented in several host-phage systems. Bacterial genes are incorporated into the phage genome and, if retained, subsequently evolve within them. The expression of these phage genes can subvert or bolster bacterial processes, including altering bacterial pathogenicity. The phage phiCDHM1 infects Clostridium difficile, a pathogenic bacterium that causes nosocomial infections and is associated with antibiotic treatment. Genome sequencing and annotation of phiCDHM1 shows that despite being closely related to other C. difficile myoviruses, it has several genes that have not been previously reported in any phage genomes. Notably, these include three homologs of bacterial genes from the accessory gene regulator (agr) quorum sensing (QS) system. These are; a pre-peptide (AgrD) of an autoinducing peptide (AIP), an enzyme which processes the pre-peptide (AgrB) and a histidine kinase (AgrC) that detects the AIP to activate a response regulator. Phylogenetic analysis of the phage and C. difficile agr genes revealed that there are three types of agr loci in this species. We propose that the phage genes belonging to a third type, agr3, and have been horizontally transferred from the host. AgrB and AgrC are transcribed during the infection of two different strains. In addition, the phage agrC appears not to be confined to the phiCDHM1 genome as it was detected in genetically distinct C. difficile strains. The discovery of QS gene homologs in a phage genome presents a novel way in which phages could influence their bacterial hosts, or neighbouring bacterial populations. This is the first time that these QS genes have been reported in a phage genome and their distribution both in C. difficile and phage genomes suggests that the agr3 locus undergoes horizontal gene transfer within this species."
https://openalex.org/W2061745280,"Protein-ligand docking is a key computational method in the design of starting points for the drug discovery process. We are motivated by the desire to automate large-scale docking using our popular docking engine idock and thus have developed a publicly-accessible web platform called istar. Without tedious software installation, users can submit jobs using our website. Our istar website supports 1) filtering ligands by desired molecular properties and previewing the number of ligands to dock, 2) monitoring job progress in real time, and 3) visualizing ligand conformations and outputting free energy and ligand efficiency predicted by idock, binding affinity predicted by RF-Score, putative hydrogen bonds, and supplier information for easy purchase, three useful features commonly lacked on other online docking platforms like DOCK Blaster or iScreen. We have collected 17,224,424 ligands from the All Clean subset of the ZINC database, and revamped our docking engine idock to version 2.0, further improving docking speed and accuracy, and integrating RF-Score as an alternative rescoring function. To compare idock 2.0 with the state-of-the-art AutoDock Vina 1.1.2, we have carried out a rescoring benchmark and a redocking benchmark on the 2,897 and 343 protein-ligand complexes of PDBbind v2012 refined set and CSAR NRC HiQ Set 24Sept2010 respectively, and an execution time benchmark on 12 diverse proteins and 3,000 ligands of different molecular weight. Results show that, under various scenarios, idock achieves comparable success rates while outperforming AutoDock Vina in terms of docking speed by at least 8.69 times and at most 37.51 times. When evaluated on the PDBbind v2012 core set, our istar platform combining with RF-Score manages to reproduce Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's correlation coefficient of as high as 0.855 and 0.859 respectively between the experimental binding affinity and the predicted binding affinity of the docked conformation. istar is freely available at http://istar.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/idock."
https://openalex.org/W2001139267,"Degradation of the cartilage proteoglycan aggrecan is an early event in the development of osteoarthritis, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-4 (ADAMTS-4) and ADAMTS-5 are considered to be the major aggrecan-degrading enzymes. We have recently found that ADAMTS-5 is rapidly endocytosed via low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and degraded by chondrocytes. Here we report that this regulatory mechanism also applies to ADAMTS-4, although its rate of endocytosis is slower than that of ADAMTS-5. Domain deletion mutagenesis of ADAMTS-4 identified that the cysteine-rich and spacer domains are responsible for binding to LRP1, whereas the thrombospondin 1 and spacer domains are responsible in ADAMTS-5. The estimated t&frac12; value of ADAMTS-4 endocytosis was about 220 min, whereas that of ADAMTS-5 was 100 min. The difference in half-lives between the two enzymes is explained by the 13-fold lower affinity of ADAMTS-4 for LRP1 compared with that of ADAMTS-5. Studies using soluble ligand binding clusters of LRP1 showed that ADAMTS-4 binds to clusters II and IV with similar KD,app values of 98 and 73 nm, respectively, whereas ADAMTS-5 binds to cluster II, III, and IV with KD,app values of 3.5, 41, and 9 nm, respectively. Thus, ADAMTS-5 competitively inhibits ADAMTS-4 endocytosis but not vice versa. This study highlights that the affinity between a ligand and LRP1 dictates the rate of internalization and suggests that LRP1 is a major traffic controller of the two aggrecanases, especially under inflammatory conditions, where the protein levels of ADAMTS-4 increase, but those of ADAMTS-5 do not."
https://openalex.org/W2080075509,"The brain response to auditory novelty comprises two main EEG components: an early mismatch negativity and a late P300. Whereas the former has been proposed to reflect a prediction error, the latter is often associated with working memory updating. Interestingly, these two proposals predict fundamentally different dynamics: prediction errors are thought to propagate serially through several distinct brain areas, while working memory supposes that activity is sustained over time within a stable set of brain areas. Here we test this temporal dissociation by showing how the generalization of brain activity patterns across time can characterize the dynamics of the underlying neural processes. This method is applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings acquired from healthy participants who were presented with two types of auditory novelty. Following our predictions, the results show that the mismatch evoked by a local novelty leads to the sequential recruitment of distinct and short-lived patterns of brain activity. In sharp contrast, the global novelty evoked by an unexpected sequence of five sounds elicits a sustained state of brain activity that lasts for several hundreds of milliseconds. The present results highlight how MEG combined with multivariate pattern analyses can characterize the dynamics of human cortical processes."
https://openalex.org/W2083275528,"Small molecule inhibitors of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)/PCNA interacting protein box (PIP-Box) interactions, including T2 amino alcohol (T2AA), inhibit translesion DNA synthesis. The crystal structure of PCNA in complex with T2AA revealed that T2AA bound to the surface adjacent to the subunit interface of the homotrimer of PCNA in addition to the PIP-box binding cavity. Because this site is close to Lys-164, which is monoubiquitinated by RAD18, we postulated that T2AA would affect monoubiquitinated PCNA interactions. Binding of monoubiquitinated PCNA and a purified pol η fragment containing the UBZ and PIP-box was inhibited by T2AA in vitro. T2AA decreased PCNA/pol η and PCNA/REV1 chromatin colocalization but did not inhibit PCNA monoubiquitination, suggesting that T2AA hinders interactions of pol η and REV1 with monoubiquitinated PCNA. Interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs) are repaired by mechanisms using translesion DNA synthesis that is regulated by monoubiquitinated PCNA. T2AA significantly delayed reactivation of a reporter plasmid containing an ICL. Neutral comet analysis of cells receiving T2AA in addition to cisplatin revealed that T2AA significantly enhanced formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by cisplatin. T2AA promoted colocalized foci formation of phospho-ATM and 53BP1 and up-regulated phospho-BRCA1 in cisplatin-treated cells, suggesting that T2AA increases DSBs. When cells were treated by cisplatin and T2AA, their clonogenic survival was significantly less than that of those treated by cisplatin only. These findings show that the inhibitors of monoubiquitinated PCNA chemosensitize cells by inhibiting repair of ICLs and DSBs.

On the replication fork, it is loaded to the border of single-stranded and double-stranded DNA (i.e. the front of DNA replication) as a cyclic homotrimer and recruits numerous components according to ongoing events. The majority of PCNA interaction partners have a characteristic short amino acid sequence called a PIP-box that binds to a cavity of PCNA on its interdomain connecting loop (1Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S. PCNA, the maestro of the replication fork.Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). The most important function of PCNA is supporting DNA replication by recruiting DNA polymerases such as pol δ via PIP-box interactions. When the replication fork encounters DNA damage such as a thymidine dimer, the pol δ on PCNA can be switched to another DNA polymerase specialized for translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), such as pol η, to enforce replication beyond the damage (2Sale J.E.

Numerous studies have shown the importance of PCNA monoubiquitination at Lys-164 for activating the TLS process by promoting DNA polymerase switching (for instance, see Ref. 3Waters L.S.

To test this hypothesis, we characterized T2AA by focusing on inhibiting monoubiquitinated PCNA and the consequential effect on ICL repair.

To harvest a protein sample containing monoubiquitinated PCNA, GM04312 cells in two culture dishes (15 cm2) were UVC-irradiated (60 J/m2), incubated for 6 h, pre-extracted at 4 °C for 5 min by CSK buffer (100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) containing 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 on the dishes, collected as pellets, sonicated at 4 °C in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture, and centrifuged to harvest the supernatant lysate. The lysate (100 μg) in 500 μl of the pulldown buffer was mixed with the indicated final concentration of the indicated compounds and the pol η(551–713)-immobilized resin (10 μl settled). After the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h, the resin was washed with the buffer four times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting sequentially for PCNA and then for His tag. The cells treated as indicated were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, collected in a spin tube, and lysed with RIPA buffer (approximately twice the volume of the cell pellet and supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Mixture and Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture (Thermo Scientific)) on ice for 0.5 h. The protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Normalized amounts of samples were loaded onto Novex SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) as indicated and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot apparatus (Invitrogen). The membrane was blocked with SuperBlock buffer (Thermo Scientific) and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies in SuperBlock at 4 °C overnight, rinsed with TBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 three times for 10 min each, incubated with the corresponding secondary IgG-HRP conjugate in SuperBlock at room temperature for 1 h, and rinsed with TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 15 min. Proteins probed on the membrane were visualized by chemiluminescence using WestPico reagent (Thermo Scientific) and developed on a BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding EGFP-pol η or EGFP-REV1 (20 μg) by electroporation. Cells were propagated in 6-well plates with a coverslip, incubated for 20 h, and treated as indicated. Cells were then rinsed with PBS one time and incubated for another 6 h in fresh medium with or without the indicated compounds (20 μm). Cells were then treated with CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EGTA) containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice to remove proteins not bound to chromatin, fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed once with PBS, and kept in cold 100% methanol. Immunofluorescence staining was performed by applying an anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (1:2000) followed by an anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (1:400). The coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Burlingame, CA) containing DAPI (1 μg/ml) for counterstaining nuclei. The stained cells were examined on a C1Si confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a Cascade 512B photomultiplier (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Images were processed using EZC1 (Nikon) and Photoshop 7 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Images were captured using a Marianas System (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO), which incorporates a Zeiss Axioplan microscope, a Yokogawa CSUX spinning disk confocal scan head, and a Photometrics Evolve CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Excitation was by DPSS lasers at 405, 488, and 561 nm, and the objective used was a 63× 1.4 NA Plan Neofluar. The colocalization was quantified by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient between the signal intensities of green and red colors in all the pixels on captured confocal images using SlideBook 5.5 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). An outline of the preparation is shown in Fig. 3A. The i5OctdU-containing oligonucleotide and iAzideN-containing oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) were synthesized as 5′-phosphorylated forms. These oligonucleotides contain an EcoRI site and HindIII overhangs with a mutation and were annealed (each 500 μm in water, 40 μl) by heating to 70 °C for 1 min and cooled to 26 °C at −1 °C for 15 s. The mixture was then mixed with aqueous copper(II) sulfate (5 mm, 5 μl) and aqueous sodium ascorbate (5 mm, 5 μl) and incubated at room temperature overnight. The oligonucleotide duplex was isolated by adding sodium acetate (3 m, 6 μl) and acetone (280 μl) and chilling at −20 °C for 1 h. The precipitate was isolated by a centrifuge and purified by excising a single band of the ICL-containing duplex oligonucleotide product from denaturing PAGE (15% TBE/urea). pGL4.50 contains an SV40 origin (residues 3155–3077) and a HindIII site between the CMV promoter region and the luciferase encoding region and was digested by HindIII according to the manufacturer's protocol and purified by agarose electrophoresis. A mixture of the purified linear pGL4.50 (10 μg) and the ICL-containing duplex oligonucleotide (11 μg, 300 eq) was ligated by T4 DNA ligase (1000 units) in 250 μl of T4 DNA ligase buffer at 16 °C for 18 h. The ligation mixture was then diluted to a total of 1500 μl in EcoRI buffer and digested by EcoRI (2500 units) at 37 °C for 20 h. The enzymes were deactivated by standard phenol/chloroform treatment. The mixture was concentrated by butanol extraction and purified by 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis. This EcoRI digestion/purification procedure is for removing any products that do not contain the ICL duplex, thus isolating only linear pGL4.50 in which both 5′ and 3′ ends were ligated by EcoRI-digested fragments of the ICL-containing duplex. The isolated product (i.e. EcoRI-digested pGL-ICL, 4.3 μg) was ligated by T4 DNA ligase (8640 units) in T4 DNA ligase buffer (1440 μl) at 16 °C for 18 h. The ligation mixture was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min, treated by phenol/chloroform, concentrated by butanol extraction, and purified by ethanol precipitation to isolate the pGL-ICL (3 μg). Small aliquots of the pGL-ICL product were analyzed as follows: 1) treated by HindIII; 2) treated by SalI; 3) SalI and duplex denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and sudden chilling on ice. No digestion in 1) but complete digestion in 2) was observed, which indicated the presence of the ICL duplex insert (data not shown). The same band appearance in 2) and 3) indicated the presence of the ICL, which prohibited strand separation (data not shown). Under this heat and chill condition, the linear pGL4.50 afforded no band in the original location on the gel (data not shown), suggesting complete strand separation and denaturing. COS7 cells (8 × 104 cells in DMEM) were seeded into a 24-well plate and allowed to attach for 5 h. The medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 1.5 times the final concentration of each indicated compound (200 μl). Immediately, the reporter transfection mixture (pGL4.50 (2.5 ng) or pGL-ICL (10 ng), pRL-TK (1 μg), FuGENE 6 (4 μl, Promega, Madison, WI), and Opti-MEM (96 μl) each per well, according to the manufacturer's recommendation) was added. After 4 h, cells were lifted by trypsin (100 μl), resuspended by adding fresh DMEM containing 1.5 times the final concentration of each indicated compound (200 μl), and replated into a 96-well plate (70 μl per well 4 times). After the cells were cultured for 14 h, the culture medium was removed, and activities of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase in the cells were measured by DLR reagent (Promega) in an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The ICL repair activity was calculated by dividing the firefly luciferase/Renilla luciferase values from cells transfected by pGL-ICL by those from cells transfected by pGL4.50, which is indicated as 1 for that of cells treated by DMSO. The neutral comet assay was performed using a protocol detailed previously (14Olive P.L. Wlodek D. Banáth J.P. DNA double strand breaks measured in individual cells subjected to gel electrophoresis.Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4671-4676PubMed Google Scholar). U2OS cells (100,000 per well) were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Following exposure to 0 or 30 μm cisplatin for 1 h, the cells were washed with PBS and subsequently exposed to 0 or 15 μm T2AA for 72 h and harvested by trypsin. Cells were mixed with molten low gelling temperature agarose (type VII) and subsequently spread and allowed to set on a glass slide precoated with agarose. Gel-embedded cells were lysed in neutral lysis buffer (0.5% SDS (w/v) and 30 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) for 4 h at 50 °C and then subjected to three washes with TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 9.5) overnight. Samples were again submerged in TBE buffer and then subjected to electrophoresis (20 V) for 25 min. Following electrophoresis, samples were rinsed with Milli-Q water and then stained twice with SYBR Green for 5 min. The samples were then destained by rinsing with Milli-Q water for 15 min 3×. Comet tails were visualized using epi-fluorescence microscopy, and the level of DNA damage was measured using the scoring system described previously (15Collins A.R. The comet assay for DNA damage and repair: principles, applications, and limitations.Mol. Biotechnol. 2004; 26: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). At least 100 cells were scored per slide. The protocol and reagents used in this assay were developed by Jasin and co-workers (16Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. XRCC3 promotes homology-directed repair of DNA damage in mammalian cells.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably transfected by a DR-GFP construct (6 × 105 cells in 2 ml of DMEM per well) were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Transfection mixture (pCBA-SceI (4 μg) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; used according to the manufacturer's recommendation, 12 μl) in Opti-MEM (total 488 μl)) was added, and the cells were cultured for 6 h. The cells were then trypsin-lifted, resuspended in DMEM, and replated into a 48-well plate (5 × 104 cells in 100 μl of DMEM per well), and 1.5 times the final concentrations of indicated compounds (200 μl) were added, followed by culturing for 72 h. The cells were then trypsin-lifted and filtered through 40-μm nylon mesh prior to running flow cytometry to count at least 10,000 viable single cells. The flow data were acquired using an LSRII flow cytometer equipped with 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm lasers (BD Biosciences). The population of singlet GFP-positive cells was reported as HR%. After HeLa (450 cells/well) or U2OS cells (300 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight, each indicated final concentration of cisplatin was added. After 24 h, a 10 μm final concentration of T2AA was added. After another 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium, and cells were cultured for another 6 (HeLa) or 7 (U2OS) days. Each treatment was done in triplicate. The cells were gently rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (w/v), and stained by 0.5% crystal violet (w/v). Colonies containing more than ∼40 cells were counted. The survival rate was reported as 1 for the average of colony numbers in wells that received vehicle control (0.9% sodium chloride (w/v) for cisplatin and DMSO for T2AA). Previously, we determined the crystal structure of PCNA/triiodothyronine (T3, Fig. 3B) in a 1:1 complex and found that T3 specifi"

Here, we describe novel functions of CRMP2. A 15-amino acid peptide from CRMP2, fused to the TAT cell-penetrating motif of the HIV-1 protein, TAT-CBD3, but not CBD3 without TAT, attenuated N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity and protected neurons against glutamate-induced Ca(2+) dysregulation, suggesting the key contribution of CRMP2 in these processes. In addition, TAT-CBD3, but not CBD3 without TAT or TAT-scramble peptide, inhibited increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) mediated by the plasmalemmal Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) operating in the reverse mode. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an interaction between CRMP2 and NMDAR as well as NCX3 but not NCX1. TAT-CBD3 disrupted CRMP2-NMDAR interaction without change in NMDAR localization. In contrast, TAT-CBD3 augmented the CRMP2-NCX3 co-immunoprecipitation, indicating increased interaction or stabilization of a complex between these proteins. Immunostaining with an anti-NCX3 antibody revealed that TAT-CBD3 induced NCX3 internalization, suggesting that both reverse and forward modes of NCX might be affected. Indeed, the forward mode of NCX, evaluated in experiments with ionomycin-induced Ca(2+) influx into neurons, was strongly suppressed by TAT-CBD3. Knockdown of CRMP2 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) prevented NCX3 internalization in response to TAT-CBD3 exposure. Moreover, CRMP2 down-regulation strongly attenuated TAT-CBD3-induced inhibition of reverse NCX. Overall, our results demonstrate that CRMP2 interacts with NCX and NMDAR and that TAT-CBD3 protects against glutamate-induced Ca(2+) dysregulation most likely via suppression of both NMDAR and NCX activities. Our results further clarify the mechanism of action of TAT-CBD3 and identify a novel regulatory checkpoint for NMDAR and NCX function based on CRMP2 interaction with these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1969210884,"Although coral reef health across the globe is declining as a result of anthropogenic impacts, relatively little is known of how environmental variability influences reef organisms other than corals and fish. Sponges are an important component of coral reef fauna that perform many important functional roles and changes in their abundance and diversity as a result of environmental change has the potential to affect overall reef ecosystem functioning. In this study, we examined patterns of sponge biodiversity and abundance across a range of environments to assess the potential key drivers of differences in benthic community structure. We found that sponge assemblages were significantly different across the study sites, but were dominated by one species Lamellodysidea herbacea (42% of all sponges patches recorded) and that the differential rate of sediment deposition was the most important variable driving differences in abundance patterns. Lamellodysidea herbacea abundance was positively associated with sedimentation rates, while total sponge abundance excluding Lamellodysidea herbacea was negatively associated with rates of sedimentation. Overall variation in sponge assemblage composition was correlated with a number of variables although each variable explained only a small amount of the overall variation. Although sponge abundance remained similar across environments, diversity was negatively affected by sedimentation, with the most sedimented sites being dominated by a single sponge species. Our study shows how some sponge species are able to tolerate high levels of sediment and that any transition of coral reefs to more sedimented states may result in a shift to a low diversity sponge dominated system, which is likely to have subsequent effects on ecosystem functioning."

https://openalex.org/W2022901113,"Apoptotic cells trigger immune tolerance in engulfing phagocytes. This poorly understood process is believed to contribute to the severe immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to nosocomial infections observed in critically ill sepsis patients. Extracellular high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an important mediator of both sepsis lethality and the induction of immune tolerance by apoptotic cells. We have found that HMGB1 is sensitive to processing by caspase-1, resulting in the production of a fragment within its N-terminal DNA-binding domain (the A-box) that signals through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) to reverse apoptosis-induced tolerance. In a two-hit mouse model of sepsis, we show that tolerance to a secondary infection and its associated mortality were effectively reversed by active immunization with dendritic cells treated with HMGB1 or the A-box fragment, but not a noncleavable form of HMGB1. These findings represent a novel link between caspase-1 and HMGB1, with potential therapeutic implications in infectious and inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2007732647,"The role of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) in virus replication has been discussed for many viruses. The known suppressive role of Hsp70 in influenza virus replication is based on studies conducted in cells with various Hsp70 expression levels. In this study, we determined the role of Hsp70 in influenza virus replication in HeLa and HEK293T cells, which express Hsp70 constitutively. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies revealed that Hsp70 interacted with PB2 or PB1 monomers and PB2/PB1 heterodimer but not with the PB1/PA heterodimer or PB2/PB1/PA heterotrimer and translocated into the nucleus with PB2 monomers or PB2/PB1 heterodimers. Knocking down Hsp70 resulted in reduced virus transcription and replication activities. Reporter gene assay, immunofluorescence assay, and Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from infected cells demonstrated that the increase in viral polymerase activity during the heat shock phase was accompanied with an increase in Hsp70 and viral polymerases levels in the nuclei, where influenza virus replication takes place, whereas a reduction in viral polymerase activity was accompanied with an increase in cytoplasmic relocation of Hsp70 along with viral polymerases. Moreover, significantly higher levels of viral genomic RNA (vRNA) were observed during the heat shock phase than during the recovery phase. Overall, for the first time, these findings suggest that Hsp70 may act as a chaperone for influenza virus polymerase, and the modulatory effect of Hsp70 appears to be a sequel of shuttling of Hsp70 between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.

Upon infection, virus enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis; the vRNP complex is released into the cytoplasm and thence transported into the nucleus. Because virus transcription and replication take place in the nucleus and viral protein synthesis and virus assembly take place in the cytoplasm, the viral proteins have to be shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm. This entire cascade of events requires interaction of viral proteins with host cellular factors. Some of these host factors participate in the virus replication and transcription. Ran-binding protein 5 was reported to interact with PB1 alone or with PB1/PA heterodimers and transfer them into the nucleus (14Deng T. Engelhardt O.G. Thomas B. Akoulitchev A.V. Brownlee G.G.

Of these, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and heat shock cognate 70 protein (Hsc70) are two major cytoplasmic isoforms. All heat shock proteins share a highly conserved domain structure comprising (i) an N-terminal ATPase domain, (ii) a middle region with protease sensitive site, (iii) C-terminal substrate binding domain, and (iv) a G/P-rich C-terminal region containing an EEVD motif enabling it to bind co-chaperones and other heat shock proteins. Many housekeeping roles have been attributed to Hsp70 such as protein folding and prevention of aggregation, refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins, signal transduction by controlling the conformation of proteins, anti-apoptotic effect, in tumorigenesis indicated by higher expression levels in many tumor cells, and membrane translocation of organellar and secretory proteins (20Tavaria M.

Studies conducted to elucidate the role of Hsp70 in influenza virus replication have suggested that Hsp70 inhibits influenza virus replication either by preventing the nuclear export of the RNP complex (34Hirayama E.

Generally, in nontransformed cells under normal conditions, Hsc70 is expressed abundantly, whereas Hsp70 is expressed at relatively low levels, but its expression increases considerably under various types of stress. Interestingly, elevated levels of Hsp70 have been reported in many tumors and transformed cell lines (36Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I.

If Hsp70 had an inhibitory effect on influenza virus replication, it would have made HEK293T or HeLa cells unsuitable for influenza virus study rather than facilitating their large scale application. Keeping this assumption in mind, we decided to study the role of Hsp70 in cells constitutively expressing it. In this study we found that Hsp70 interacted and translocated into the nucleus with PB2 monomers or PB2/PB1 heterodimers, presumably assisting the assembly of the viral polymerase complex. Knockdown of Hsp70 resulted in significant reductions in both virus transcription and replication. Moreover, an increase in viral polymerase activity was observed during the heat shock phase compared with the recovery phase, coinciding with the subcellular movement of Hsp70, suggesting that Hsp70 acted as chaperone for the viral polymerase complex. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T) and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (PR8) was obtained from the virus repository of our laboratory. Primary mAbs used in Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assays included anti-PB2 (143/3), anti-PB1 (81/2) and anti-PA (58/1 and 65/4) (42Hatta M. Asano Y. Masunaga K. Ito T. Okazaki K.

All primary antibodies used were of mouse origin except anti-Lamin B1 and anti-Hsp90, which were rabbit polyclonal and rat monoclonal antibodies, respectively. HRP-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-rat mAbs were used as secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in Western blot analysis, whereas Alexa Fluor 488® goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 405® goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Invitrogen) were employed in immunofluorescence assays. Prostaglandin A1 (PGA1) was purchased from Cayman Chemicals, and TNFα and cycloheximide (CHX) were purchased from Wako, Japan. The plasmids containing influenza virus polymerase and NP genes of A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (H5N1) (HK483) (pCAGGS-HK483PB2, -PB1, -PA, and -NP), PR8 (pCAGGS-PR8-PB2, -PB1, -PA, and -NP) and A/Aichi/2/1968 (H3N2) (Aichi) (pHH21-AichiPB2, -PB1, -PA, and -NP) were kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka (Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). For constructing plasmids expressing full-length PB2 and PB1 proteins of the HK483 influenza virus with N-terminal FLAG tags (FLAG-HK483PB2 and FLAG-HK483PB1), PCR products were amplified from pCAGGS-HK483PB2 and pCAGGS-HK483PB1 as templates using following primer pairs: FLAG-PB2-F/SacI (5′-TATTGAGCTCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGGGCGGCATGGAAAGAATAAAAGAACTACG-3′) and PB2-R/XhoI (5′-ATATCTCGAGTCACTAATTGATGGCCATCCGAATTC-3′) for FLAG-HK483PB2 and FLAG-PB1-F/Acc65I (5′-TATTGGTACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGGGCGGCATGGATGTCAATCCGACTTTAC-3′) and PB1-R/SphI (5′-ATATGCATGCTCACTACTTCCCTTGCCGTCCGAGCTC-3′) for FLAG-HK483PB1. Then amplified FLAG-HK483PB2 and FLAG-HK483PB1 PCR products were digested with SacI/XhoI and Acc65I/SphI restriction enzymes, respectively, and cloned into the respective restriction sites of pCAGGS plasmid. The ORFs of PB2, PB1, and PA genes of Aichi were amplified from pHH21-AichiPB2, -PB1, and -PA as templates using following primer pairs: PB2–1F/KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCATGGAAAGAATAAAAGAACTACG-3′) and PB2-R/XhoI (5′-ATCTCGAGTTAATTGATGGCCATCCGAATTC-3′) for Aichi-PB2, PB1–1F/KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCATGGATGTCAATCCGAC-3′) and PB1-R/XhoI (5′-ATCTCGAGTCACTATTTTTGCCGTCTG-3′) for Aichi-PB1 and PA-1F/KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCATGGAAGATTTTGTAC-3′) and PA-R/XhoI (5′-ATCTCGAGCTATCTTAATGCATGTG-3′) for Aichi-PB1. The amplified PCR products were cloned into the respective restriction sites of pCAGGS plasmid. For cloning human Hsp70 (NM-005345), total RNA was extracted from HEK293T cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using oligo(dT)20 primer to generate cDNAs. These cDNAs were used to amplify the Hsp70 coding region using primer pair hHsp70-F/KpnI (5′-ATAAGGTACCATGGCCAAAGCCGCGGCGATC-3′) and hHsp70-R/XhoI (5′-ATATCTCGAGTCACTAATCTACCTCCTCAATGG-3′). The amplified PCR product was digested with KpnI and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of the pCAGGS expression plasmid producing a pCAGGS-Hsp70 plasmid. A HA tag was inserted at the N terminus of the Hsp70 coding region by PCR using pCAGGS-Hsp70 as the template and primer pair HA-hHsp70-F/KpnI (5′-GGGGTACCACCATGGACTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTGCCAAAGCCGCGGCGATCGGCATCGAC-3′) and hHsp70-R/XhoI. The amplified PCR product was digested with KpnI and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned into the respective sites of the pCAGGS expression plasmid yielding pCAGGS-HA-Hsp70. The reporter plasmid pHW72-Luc2CP was constructed by substituting the open reading frame of enhanced GFP in pHW72-EGFP plasmid (kindly provided by R. Webby at St. Jude Children Research Hospital) with firefly luciferase gene (45Hoffmann E. Neumann G. Hobom G. Webster R.G. Kawaoka Y. “Ambisense” approach for the generation of influenza A virus. vRNA and mRNA synthesis from one template.Virology. 2000; 267: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The pCAGGS-Luc2CP plasmid was constructed by amplifying the firefly luciferase (Luc2CP) gene using primer pair Luc2CP-1F/SacI (5′-ATTGAGCTCAATGGAAGATGCCA-3′) and Luc2CP-1830R/KpnI (5′-AATGGTACCCTATTAGACGTTGATCC-3′) and cloning the PCR product into the SacI and KpnI restriction sites of pCAGGS vector. HEK293T cells, grown in 10-cm tissue culture plates, were transfected with the plasmids indicated in the figures, using TransIT®-LT1 (Mirus). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, 280 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT; supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture, Complete Mini EDTA free; Roche Applied Sciences), subjected to sonication, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Then anti-FLAG affinity gel (anti-FLAG® M2-agarose gel; Sigma), washed three times with lysis buffer, was incubated with whole cell extracts overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The gel was washed five times with lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted using 3× FLAG peptide (F4799; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The interaction between wild type PB2 protein and endogenous Hsp70 was evaluated similarly, except that cell lysate was mixed with anti-PB2 mAb (143/3), and immunoprecipitation was carried out using Protein G-SepharoseTM 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). The bound proteins were eluted using low pH buffer (0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 3.5). The immunoprecipitated proteins were identified by Western blotting using protein specific antibodies. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation was carried out by transfecting HEK293T cells with HA-Hsp70 and viral polymerase expression plasmids as indicated in the figures. The immunoprecipitation procedure was the same as that described above except that whole cell extracts were mixed with anti-HA affinity gel (EZviewTM Red anti-HA affinity gel; Sigma) and bound proteins were eluted using influenza HA peptide (I2149; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293T cells were fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions, with little modification, as described by Suzuki et al. (46Suzuki K. Bose P. Leong-Quong R.Y. Fujita D.J. Riabowol K. REAP. A two minute cell fractionation method.BMC Res. Notes. 2010; 3: 294Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 10-cm tissue culture plates were infected with PR8 influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or mock infected. After 12 h of incubation, the cells were subjected to the heat shock or allowed to recover for indicated time points (see Fig. 8). The monolayers and resuspended cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Then pelleted cells were resuspended in ice-cold 0.1% Nonidet P-40-PBS and lysed by pipetting up and down several times. A portion of the cell suspension was kept as whole cell lysate. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were collected as “cytosolic fraction,” whereas the pellets (nuclei) were washed twice with ice-cold 0.1% Nonidet P-40-PBS. The harvested pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, sonicated for 30 s, and collected as “nuclear fraction.” Equivalent proportions of two fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The purity of the fractions was assessed by detecting specific subcellular marker proteins such as α-tubulin as cytoplasmic protein and Lamin B1 as nuclear protein. The siRNA targeting Hsp70 (siHsp70-1) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (sc-29352). An additional Hsp70-specific siRNA (siHsp70-2, 5′-CGGUGGUGCAGUCGGACAUGA-3′) was designed using an online siRNA designing tool: Design for Small Interfering RNA (DSIR) (47Vert J.P. Foveau N. Lajaunie C. Vandenbrouck Y. An accurate and interpretable model for siRNA efficacy prediction.BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 520Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The siHsp70-2 and a nonsilencing control siRNA (5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) (48Kim J. Ahn S. Ren X.R. Whalen E.J. Reiter E. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) were purchased from Sigma Genosys siRNA Service. HEK293T and HeLa cells were transfected twice (first reverse transfection and second forward transfection) on alternative days with Hsp70-specific siRNA, control siRNA and transfection buffer alone (mock) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. HEK293T and HeLa cells were transfected with final concentrations of 80 and 40 nm for siHsp70-1, respectively, and 80 nm for siHsp70-2. Control siRNA concentrations were kept similar to those of Hsp70-specific siRNAs. Twenty-four hours after Hsp70 knockdown, cells were either infected with PR8 influenza virus at a MOI of 0.1 or transfected with HK483 or PR8 RNP expression plasmids for further analysis. Luciferase (firefly and Renilla luciferase) activities were measured with GloMax96 microplate Luminometer (Promega) using the Dual-Luciferase® assay system (Promega). All transfections in HEK293T or HeLa cells were performed using TransIT®-LT1 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Luciferase activities were measured at 24 h post-transfection, except where otherwise indicated. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to the transfection control Renilla luciferase activities and were expressed relat"
https://openalex.org/W2127382246,"Objective Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) have diffuse subtle gray matter (GM) atrophy detectable by MRI quantification analyses. However, it is not clear whether the etiology and seizure frequency are associated with this atrophy. We aimed to evaluate the occurrence of GM atrophy and the influence of seizure frequency in patients with TLE and either normal MRI (TLE-NL) or MRI signs of HS (TLE-HS). Methods We evaluated a group of 172 consecutive patients with unilateral TLE-HS or TLE-NL as defined by hippocampal volumetry and signal quantification (122 TLE-HS and 50 TLE-NL) plus a group of 82 healthy individuals. Voxel-based morphometry was performed with VBM8/SPM8 in 3T MRIs. Patients with up to three complex partial seizures and no generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the previous year were considered to have infrequent seizures. Those who did not fulfill these criteria were considered to have frequent seizures. Results Patients with TLE-HS had more pronounced GM atrophy, including the ipsilateral mesial temporal structures, temporal lobe, bilateral thalami and pre/post-central gyri. Patients with TLE-NL had more subtle GM atrophy, including the ipsilateral orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral thalami and pre/post-central gyri. Both TLE-HS and TLE-NL showed increased GM volume in the contralateral pons. TLE-HS patients with frequent seizures had more pronounced GM atrophy in extra-temporal regions than TLE-HS with infrequent seizures. Patients with TLE-NL and infrequent seizures had no detectable GM atrophy. In both TLE-HS and TLE-NL, the duration of epilepsy correlated with GM atrophy in extra-hippocampal regions. Conclusion Although a diffuse network GM atrophy occurs in both TLE-HS and TLE-NL, this is strikingly more evident in TLE-HS and in patients with frequent seizures. These findings suggest that neocortical atrophy in TLE is related to the ongoing seizures and epilepsy duration, while thalamic atrophy is more probably related to the original epileptogenic process."
https://openalex.org/W2056371451,"The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) is the main route of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells and is a common mechanism through which numerous cellular pathways are regulated. To date, several reverse genetics techniques have been reported that harness the power of the UPP for selectively reducing the levels of otherwise stable proteins. However, each of these approaches has been narrowly developed for a single substrate and cannot be easily extended to other protein substrates of interest. To address this shortcoming, we created a generalizable protein knock-out method by engineering protein chimeras called ""ubiquibodies"" that combine the activity of E3 ubiquitin ligases with designer binding proteins to steer virtually any protein to the UPP for degradation. Specifically, we reprogrammed the substrate specificity of a modular human E3 ubiquitin ligase called CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) by replacing its natural substrate-binding domain with a single-chain Fv (scFv) intrabody or a fibronectin type III domain monobody that target their respective antigens with high specificity and affinity. Engineered ubiquibodies reliably transferred ubiquitin to surface exposed lysines on target proteins and even catalyzed the formation of biologically relevant polyubiquitin chains. Following ectopic expression of ubiquibodies in mammalian cells, specific and systematic depletion of desired target proteins was achieved, whereas the levels of a natural substrate of CHIP were unaffected. Taken together, engineered ubiquibodies offer a simple, reproducible, and customizable means for directly removing specific cellular proteins through accelerated proteolysis."

To gain more insights into the Notch signaling and its role in regulation of metabolism, we studied the mitochondrial proteome in Notch1-activated K562 cells using a comparative proteomics approach. The proteomic study led to the identification of 10 unique proteins that were altered due to Notch1 activation. Eight of these proteins belonged to mitochondria-localized metabolic pathways like oxidative phosphorylation, glutamine metabolism, Krebs cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. Validation of some of these findings showed that constitutive activation of Notch1 deregulated glutamine metabolism and Complex 1 of the respiratory chain. Furthermore, the deregulation of glutamine metabolism involved the canonical Notch signaling and its downstream effectors. The study also reports the effect of Notch signaling on mitochondrial function and status of high energy intermediates ATP, NADH, and NADPH.

Mitochondria are one of the most important subcellular organelles that plays a key role in many cellular functions. Two main functions of mitochondria are energy production in the form of ATP via the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) 3The abbreviations used are: OXPHOSoxidative phosphorylation systemRBP-Jκrecombinant signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin-κJ regionDIGEdifferential in gel electrophoresisNICDNotch intracellular domainN1ICDNotch1 intracellular domainGSIγ-secretase inhibitorDNdominant negative CBF-1MAMmitochondria-associated membraneIBisolation bufferIB2isolation buffer 2VDACvoltage-dependent anion channel proteinPDHpyruvate dehydrogenase complexGLUD1glutamate dehydrogenase 1OATornithine aminotransferaseGLSglutaminaseMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. and regulation of the apoptosis pathway. Apart from these mitochondria are hubs where most of the metabolic pathways occur completely or partially, like the Krebs cycle, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, pyrimidine biosynthesis, urea cycle, heme biosynthesis, etc. The size of the mammalian mitochondrial proteome predicted by computational studies is ∼1500–2000 proteins (1Taylor S.W.

The Notch signaling constitutes an evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway that can control cell fate decisions, proliferation, and apoptosis (3Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J.

Notch upon interaction with its ligands undergoes successive cleavage of the Notch receptor by ADAM family metalloproteases followed by γ-secretase, resulting in the production of Notch intracellular domain, which then enters the nucleus. In the nucleus, this interacts with the DNA-binding protein recombinant signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin-κJ region (RBP-Jκ, also known as CBF-1), displaces the co-repressor from of RBP-Jκ complex, and converts it into a transcriptional activator that includes other co activators (5Schroeter E.H.

Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2004; 9: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and most patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia harbor activating Notch1 mutations (9Weng A.P. Ferrando A.A. Lee W. Morris 4th, J.P. Silverman L.B. Sanchez-Irizarry C. Blacklow S.C. Look A.T. Aster J.C. Activating mutations of NOTCH1 in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Science. 2004; 306: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar). There is a growing interest in understanding the role of Notch signaling in the regulation of cellular metabolism. Earlier studies showed that during T-cell development Notch signaling activation could up-regulate glycolysis via Akt (10Ciofani M. Zúñiga-Pflücker J.C. Notch promotes survival of pre-T cells at the β-selection checkpoint by regulating cellular metabolism.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar); recently it was found that both activation and deactivation of Notch pathway lead to increased glycolysis affecting the progression of tumor (11Landor S.K. Mutvei A.P. Mamaeva V. Jin S. Busk M. Borra R. Grönroos T.J. Kronqvist P. Lendahl U. Sahlgren C.M. Hypo- and hyperactivated Notch signaling induce a glycolytic switch through distinct mechanisms.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 18814-18819Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but very little has been explored regarding the role of Notch pathway on the other metabolic pathways. In this paper we therefore aimed to decipher the effect of the activation of Notch1 pathway on mitochondrial proteome. We compared the mitochondrial proteome of K562 and K562 with constitutively activated Notch1 pathway by two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE) analyses. The study showed that Notch1 pathway activation alters expression of key mitochondria-localized metabolic pathway proteins. Further validation of some of the protein expression by other methods showed that glutamine metabolism and Complex 1 of respiratory chain are deregulated, but the mitochondrial integrity is maintained. The deregulation of glutamine metabolism has been shown to be regulated by canonical Notch signaling pathway and establish the cross-talk between Notch signaling and glutamine utilization. These data provide new insight into the effect of Notch pathway in the regulation of cellular metabolism. K562, HEL, and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (Invitrogen). MCF7 and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen). Cells were stably transfected with Notch1 intracellular domain, pcDNA-Myc-HisN1IC (N1ICD), and control vector by lipofection (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen). For a metabolic dependence study, RPMI without glutamine/glucose were used along with 10% FBS. NIH-3T3 cells expressing either empty vector or jagged1, a ligand for Notch receptor, was used in co-culture experiments to induce endogenous Notch signaling pathway (12Cheng P. Gabrilovich D. Notch signaling in differentiation and function of dendritic cells.Immunol. Res. 2008; 41: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, γ-secretase inhibitor (Calbiochem) as well as dominant negative CBF-1 (DN-CBF-1) were used to inhibit the cellular Notch signaling. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (13Rezaul K. Wu L. Mayya V. Hwang S.I. Han D. A systematic characterization of mitochondrial proteome from human T leukemia cells.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 169-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and resuspended with isolation buffer (IB: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 m sucrose, and a mixture of protease inhibitors), 1.5 ml per ∼107 cells. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the cells were homogenized by using a needle and a syringe. The homogenates were centrifuged twice at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells (Fraction 1). The postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The pellet is the mitochondrial fraction (Fraction 3), and the supernatant is the cytosolic fraction (Fraction 2). The pellet was again resuspended in IB and washed by centrifuging at 6000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. This mitochondrial fraction was then resuspended in isotonic sucrose buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), layered on a 1.0/1.5 m discontinuous sucrose gradient in isotonic sucrose buffer, and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C in OptimaTM TLX, Beckman Coulter. The mitochondria were collected from the interphase of 1.0 and 1.5 m sucrose, diluted in the isotonic sucrose buffer, and centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 20 min to pellet mitochondria (enriched mitochondria). Enriched mitochondrial pellets were washed with isolation buffer and then preserved at −80 °C until further analysis. The enriched mitochondria fraction contained mitochondria along with mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) fraction. For further removal of the MAM fraction from enriched mitochondria, the method reported previously was used (14Hoffstrom B.G. Kaplan A. Letso R. Schmid R.S. Turmel G.J. Lo D.C. Stockwell B.R. Inhibitors of protein disulfide isomerase suppress apoptosis induced by misfolded proteins.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, the enriched mitochondria was resuspended in 350 μl of isolation buffer 2 (IB2: 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture) and layered over 2.0 ml of 30% (v/v) Percoll (GE Healthcare) in IB2 and centrifuged (95,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) in Optima™ TLX, Beckman Coulter. After centrifugation two distinct bands separated by a clear zone were isolated and diluted 4-fold in cold IB2 buffer to remove the Percoll. The lower band constituted the MAM free mitochondria, and the upper band constituted the MAM fraction with incomplete removal of mitochondria (Fraction 4). The enriched mitochondrial pellet was lysed by incubating in DIGE labeling buffer (4% w/v CHAPS, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) for 1 h on ice with vortexing at regular intervals and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay reagent (Bio-Rad). CyDye (GE Healthcare) labeling was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50 μg of mitochondrial protein from K562 or KN1ICD was minimally labeled with 400 pmol of either Cy3 or Cy5 for comparison on the same two-dimensional gel. Internal standard aliquots of each sample were pooled and labeled with Cy2. The labeled samples were incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark and then 1 μl of 10 mm lysine was added to stop the reaction. The samples were diluted in equal volume of 2×-DIGE labeling buffer (4% w/v CHAPS, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 130 mm DTT, 4% 3/10 ampholytes), and a total volume of 150 μl was made up with rehydration buffer (2% w/v CHAPS, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 50 mm DTT, and 2% 3/10 ampholytes). Samples were loaded via cup loading on overnight rehydrated immobilized pH gradient strips (17 cm, pH 5–8, Bio-Rad). Focusing was performed at a maximum of 20 °C for 100,000 volt hours. After focusing, the immobilized pH gradient strips were equilibrated for 30 min with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 1% of DTT for reduction followed by alkylation with 2.5% iodoacetamide. The second-dimension separations were carried out in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels run at 20 mA/gel for 30 min and then 30 mA/gel until the dye reached the bottom of the gels. All samples and their dye-swapped counterparts were run in triplicate generating six replicates. Fluorescence images of the gels were acquired on a Typhoon TRIO scanner (GE Healthcare) with a resolution of 100 μm. Spot detection was performed on the gel images using the DeCyder software (Version 6.5). A differential in-gel analysis module was done by setting the target spot number to 1000. All six gels were added to the appropriate workspace and group and matched to a master gel sequentially using the DeCyder module BVA (Version 6.5.14). For grouped comparison, significance was calculated using two-tailed t tests, and differentially expressed proteins with an absolute ratio of at least 1.4-fold and p ≤ 0.05 were selected as proteins of interest. For the preparative gel, >500 μg of mitochondrial protein was resolved in a two-dimensional gel and stained with Blue Silver (15Candiano G. Bruschi M. Musante L. Santucci L. Ghiggeri G.M. Carnemolla B. Orecchia P. Zardi L. Righetti P.G. Blue silver. A very sensitive colloidal Coomassie G-250 staining for proteome analysis.Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Proteins of interest were excised. The excised spots were destained, and then tryptic digestion was performed overnight using Trypsin Gold (Promega, Madison, WI). The digestion mixture was lyophilized in a Heto vacuum centrifuge (Thermo) and resuspended in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution. The dissolved samples were spotted on the MALDI plate along with matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. MALDI analyses were performed with a 4700 Proteomic Analyzer MALDI-TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems) for identification of the protein spots. Peptide mass fingerprinting data were acquired in positive MS reflector mode, and for tandem mass spectrometry the peptides were selected according to their intensity and subjected to further fragmentation and MS identification. Spectral data were analyzed with GPS ExplorerTM Version 3.6 (Applied Biosystems). Peptide identification was based on the MASCOT database-scoring algorithm from MSDB protein databases using search settings of single missed tryptic cut, fixed modification of carbamidomethylation, precursor tolerance of 300 ppm, and MS/MS fragment tolerance of 1.2 Da. Autotryptic peaks were excluded in the MASCOT search parameter, and p < 0.05 was considered significant during identification along with at least two MS/MS hits were considered a true “hit.” Because we had taken a gel-based proteomics approach, we could identify specific proteins from a particular spot according to the molecular weight and pI from the protein list given by MASCOT server. RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Roche Applied Science). The expression level of genes was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR Green core PCR reagents (Applied Biosystems). HPRT1 was used to normalize the expression of the genes. The reactions were carried out in 7500 Sequence Detection Systems (Applied Biosystems). The primers used HPRT1 5′-GACACTGGCAAAACAATGCAGAC-3′ and 5′-TGGCTTATATCCAACACTTCGTGG-3′; GLS 5′-TGGGCAACAGTGTTAAGGGAA-3′ and 5′- GGAATGCCTTTGATCACCACC-3′; OAT 5′-GCACATTTGCAGAGGTTTGCT-3′ and 5′-GTCATCAGAGGTTGGAGGGC-3′; NDUFV2 5′-CCTGTGTGAACGCACCAATG-3′ and 5′-TGGCCCTGGTTTTGGGATTT-3′; NDUFS1 5′-CGTCGTGGTCCAGACAGTTT-3′ and 5′-TCAAGTTGCTTGCTGCTGTG-3′; ECHS1 5′-GCCTCGGGTGCTAACTTTGA-3′ and 5′-GCCATCGCAAAGTGCATTGA-3′; Hey1 5′-CTGCAGATGACCGTGGATCA-3′ and 5′-CAACTTCTGCCAGGCATTCC-3′; Hes1 5′-GAAGGCGGACATTCTGGAAA-3′ and 5′GTTCATGCACTCGCTGAAGC3′. Experiments were repeated at least three times. For Western blotting cells or mitochondria were lysed in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Equal amounts of protein was run on SDS-PAGE and blotted on PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare). After incubation with primary and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, the blots were developed using Enhanced Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fischer Scientific). For whole cell lysate GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, Denver, CO) or β-actin (Abcam) was used as the loading control. For mitochondria fraction prohibitin (Thermo Fischer Scientific) was used as the loading control as the two-dimensional DIGE Decyder based analysis showed that it remains constant across the six replicates. The other antibodies used for the study are OAT, NUDFS1, GLS, ECHS1, RBP-Jκ, ERp57, and c-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), VDAC (Cell Signaling Technology), TIM-23 (Pharmingen), cleaved Notch1, Lamin, Hey1 (Abcam), and calreticulin (Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada). We used the RBP-Jκ Cignal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for the quantification of Notch canonical pathway signaling. The expression of the firefly luciferase was quantified with a Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All transfections were performed in triplicate. The level of the firefly luciferase activity was normalized by the corresponding level of the Renilla luciferase activity, and the values for the negative control were normalized. Luminescence was measured using a Sirius Luminometer, Berthold Detection Systems. MTT assay was performed with the Cell Proliferation Kit I (MTT) (Roche Applied Science) for understanding the metabolic dependence on glutamine and glucose. Briefly, an equal number of cells (1 × 104) was plated in specific media (RPMI, glutamine-free, or glucose free RPMI) for 48 h. Then they were incubated with MTT reagent (final concentration, 0.5 mg/ml) for 2 h. At the end of incubation period the dye was solubilized with acidic isopropyl alcohol (0.04 m HCl in absolute isopropyl alcohol). The absorbance of the dye was measured at a 570-nm wavelength with background subtraction at 650 nm. The readings at 48 h were normalized with the reading at 0 h. ADP/ATP, NAD+/NADH, and cellular NADPH were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Abcam). NADPH was expressed as pmol of NADPH per μg of protein. To measure oxygen consumption rate cells were suspended in equal concentration, and 500 μl of the suspension was added to the oxygraph chamber (Hansatech) in air-saturated PBS + 20 mm glucose. The rotenone-sensitive NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of Complex 1 was performed spectrophotometrically. Complex I oxidizes NADH, and the electrons produced reduce the artificial substrate decylubiquinone, which subsequently delivers the electrons to dichloroindophenol. The reduction of dichloroindophenol can be followed spectrophotometrically at 600 nm as reported previously by others (16Janssen A.J. Trijbels F.J. Sengers R.C. Smeitink J.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Wintjes L.T. Stoltenborg-Hogenkamp B.J. Rodenburg R.J. Spectrophotometric assay for complex I of the respiratory chain in tissue samples and cultured fibroblasts.Clin. Chem. 2007; 53: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and normalized to the protein amount. A Dipstick assay kit for PDH activity from Mitosciences was employed. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol for isolated mitochondria. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were added to a 96-well plate followed by adsorption onto dipsticks containing immobilized antibody against the PDH complex and the addition of the activity buffer, which contained substrates for the PDH reaction. PDH activity was determined densitometrically from the bands with the target protein-antibody complexes formed on dipsticks in images taken with Versa Doc (Bio-Rad) scanner in colorimetric setting. Cells (1 × 104/well) were cultured in a 24-well plate for 48 h in specific medium. Medium was collected, and cells were lysed. Concentrations of glutamine in the medium were determined with the glutamine/glutamate determination kit (Sigma). The experiment was performed according to the manufactures protocol. Briefly, each sample was divided into two; one was measured with glutaminase for transferring the glutamine into glutamate, and the other was measured directly. The glutamate present was then converted to α-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase accompanied by reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The amount of NADH is proportional to the amount of glutamate and was measured using a spectrophotometer at 340 nm. Glutamine levels were calculated by subtracting the second reading from total glutamate obtained from the first reading. The glutamine level of their culture medium was measured similarly, and the glutamine consumption was calculated (glutamine in culture medium-glutamine in medium after culturing cells for 48 h), normalized to protein level, and then the -fold change with respect to the control cell was calculated. The mitochondrial membrane potential sensitive dye, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl benzimidazolyl carbocyanine iodide (JC1; Invitrogen) was used in flow cytometry analysis on a BD Biosciences FACS Calibur platform using FL1 channel (unbound JC1) and FL2 channel (mitochondrial membrane bound JC-1). Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone-treated cells had their membrane potential disrupted. Cells were stained with 50 nm nonyl acridine orange (Invitrogen) for 45 min at 37 °C in dark and were then subjected to flow cytometry. Statistical significance of the difference between the different conditions was assessed using Student's two-tailed t test. All calculations were performed using Microsoft Office Excel unless otherwise mentioned. For examining the effect of Notch1 signaling on the mitochondrial proteome, we stably expressed the constitutively active form of Notch1, i.e. the Notch1 intracellular domain in human cell line K562 (this is referred as KN1ICD). K562 cells express Notch1 receptors, but the pathway is not activated (17Kannan S. Sutphin R.M. Hall M.G. Golfman L.S. Fang W. Nolo R.M. Akers L.J. Hammitt R.A. McMurray J.S. Kornblau S.M. Melnick A.M. Figueroa M.E. Zweidler-McKay P.A. Notch activation inhibits AML growth and survival. A potential therapeutic approach.J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that there was a high expression of cleaved Notch1 in KN1ICD cells compared with the mock-transfected K562 cells (K562 mock) (Fig. 1A). An increase in Notch activity was identified from RBP-Jκ luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 1B). An earlier effect of Notch1 activation in K562 cells has been studied to understand its influence on differentiation or cell growth (18Ishiko E. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Gale K. Ishiko J. Satoh Y.

Notch signaling inhibits the growth of the human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562.Leuk Res. 2009; 33: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here the effect of Notch signaling on the expression of mitochondrial proteins and the cellular metabolism has been investigated. For this, the two-dimensional DIGE-based comparative study of the mitochondrial proteome was performed. Mitochondria were isolated from K562 mock and KN1ICD, and its quality was judged by Western blotting using organelle specific markers, nuclear marker lamin, cytoplasm marker GAPDH, mitochondrial markers VDAC, TIM23, and MAM fraction marker calreticulin, as depicted in Fig. 1C. For a further study the enriched mitochondrial fraction containing mitochondria and MAM was used. The Decyder-based analysis of the two-dimensional DIGE gels revealed a set of 11 protein spots that showed significant (absolute -fold change ≥1.4, p ≤ 0.05) alteration and was represented in all the six replicates. Fig. 1D shows a representative gel with spot numbers indicating the altered proteins. This indicates that Notch1 activation can alter the mitochondrial proteome and affect the expression of mitochondrial proteins. The 11 protein spots that altered significantly were subjected to MALDI TOF/TOF-based tandem MS analysis. 10 unique proteins were identified based on mass spectrometry. All the altered proteins that were identified matched with more than one peptide and gave at least two MS/MS hits with p < 0.05. Among these, 10 proteins, 8 proteins were known mitochondrial protein, and the pathways to which these proteins belonged were analyzed from the gene ontology (GO) provided in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database. The eight proteins are enoyl-CoA hydratase, mitochondrial (ECHS1, 1.8 ± 0.074) (1), glutaminase kidney isoform, mitochondrial (GLS, −1.44 ± 0.0580) (2), NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75-kDa subunit, mitochondrial (NDUFS1, −2.63 ± 0.0427, −1.95 ± 0.0316) (3 and 4), NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 2, mitochondrial (NDUFV2, −1.53 ± 0.0583 (5), ornithine aminotransferase, mitochondrial (OAT, −2.07 ± 0.1077 (7), succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein subunit, mitochondrial (SDHA, −1.56 ± 0.0419) (9), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, mitochondrial (DLD, 1.49 ± 0.1189) (10), and glutamate dehydrogenase 1, mitochondrial (GLUD1, −1.44 ± 0.1046) (11), and two proteins were non-mitochondrial keratin, type II cytoskeletal 8 (KRT8, 3.55 ± 0.5745) (6) and protein disulfide isomerase A3 (ERP57, 1.68 ± 0.126) (8). The eight mitochondrial proteins identified all belonged to mitochondria-localized metabolic pathways like oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), glutamine metabolism, Krebs cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. The metabolic pathways to which these proteins belong along with their mass spectrometry identification details are provided in Table 1, and the details of the mass spectrometry spectra are provided in the supplemental material. Fig. 2A shows the two-dimensional DIGE segment of some of the altered proteins. Validation of some of the proteins at mRNA and protein levels was also performed (Fig. 2, B and C). Alteration of OAT and NDUFS1 in other cell lines (HEL and MCF7) due to Notch1 activation has also been checked (Fig. 2D). Thereby, further studies address how Notch1 signaling effects the expression of these proteins, the pathways to which they belong, and to the overall cellular metabolic state.TABLE 1Decyder-based alterations in mitochondrial protein expression of KN1ICD in comparison with K562 mock along with their mas"
https://openalex.org/W2089457468,"Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare neuro-respiratory disorder associated with mutations of the PHOX2B gene. Patients with this disease experience severe hypoventilation during sleep and are consequently ventilator-dependent. However, they breathe almost normally while awake, indicating the existence of cortical mechanisms compensating for the deficient brainstem generation of automatic breathing. Current evidence indicates that the supplementary motor area plays an important role in modulating ventilation in awake normal humans. We hypothesized that the wake-related maintenance of spontaneous breathing in patients with CCHS could involve supplementary motor area.We studied 7 CCHS patients (5 women; age: 20-30; BMI: 22.1 ± 4 kg.m(-2)) during resting breathing and during exposure to carbon dioxide and inspiratory mechanical constraints. They were compared with 8 healthy individuals. Segments of electroencephalographic tracings were selected according to ventilatory flow signal, from 2.5 seconds to 1.5 seconds after the onset of inspiration. After artefact rejection, 80 or more such segments were ensemble averaged. A slow upward shift of the EEG signal starting between 2 and 0.5 s before inspiration (pre-inspiratory potential) was considered suggestive of supplementary motor area activation.In the control group, pre-inspiratory potentials were generally absent during resting breathing and carbon dioxide stimulation, and consistently identified in the presence of inspiratory constraints (expected). In CCHS patients, pre-inspiratory potentials were systematically identified in all study conditions, including resting breathing. They were therefore significantly more frequent than in controls.This study provides a neurophysiological substrate to the wakefulness drive to breathe that is characteristic of CCHS and suggests that the supplementary motor area contributes to this phenomenon. Whether or not this ""cortical breathing"" can be taken advantage of therapeutically, or has clinical consequences (like competition with attentional resources) remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2073136496,"Pseudomonas putida CSV86, a plasmid-free strain possessing capability to transfer the naphthalene degradation property, has been explored for its metabolic diversity through genome sequencing. The analysis of draft genome sequence of CSV86 (6.4 Mb) revealed the presence of genes involved in the degradation of naphthalene, salicylate, benzoate, benzylalcohol, p-hydroxybenzoate, phenylacetate and p-hydroxyphenylacetate on the chromosome thus ensuring the stability of the catabolic potential. Moreover, genes involved in the metabolism of phenylpropanoid and homogentisate, as well as heavy metal resistance, were additionally identified. Ability to grow on vanillin, veratraldehyde and ferulic acid, detection of inducible homogentisate dioxygenase and growth on aromatic compounds in the presence of heavy metals like copper, cadmium, cobalt and arsenic confirm in silico observations reflecting the metabolic versatility. In silico analysis revealed the arrangement of genes in the order: tRNA(Gly), integrase followed by nah operon, supporting earlier hypothesis of existence of a genomic island (GI) for naphthalene degradation. Deciphering the genomic architecture of CSV86 for aromatic degradation pathways and identification of elements responsible for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) suggests that genetic bioaugmentation strategies could be planned using CSV86 for effective bioremediation."
https://openalex.org/W2074573299,"A novel β-glucosidase (BglPm) was identified from Paenibacillus mucilaginosus KCTC 3870(T) which has ginsenoside converting activity. The gene, termed bglPm, consists of 1,260 bp and belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1). After being overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli, the enzymatic properties of BglPm were investigated. The enzyme exhibited an optimal activity at 45°C and pH 7.5 and showed high bioconversion ability for major ginsenoside Rb1 and Rd into ginsenoside F2. Thus, it was used for mass production of relatively high pure F2 from relatively abundant protopanaxadiol type ginsenosides mixture (PPDGM) with combined usage of ginsenoside Rc-hydrolyzing enzyme. Scale-up of production using 250 g of the PPDGM resulted in 152 g of F2 with 80.1% chromatography purity and 95.7% recovery. These results suggest that this enzyme would be useful in the preparation of pharmacologically active ginsenoside F2 in the functional food and pharmaceutical industries."
https://openalex.org/W2158052066,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 12 (PTPN12), has been identified as a potent tumor suppressor in human cancers and a critical regulator of cell adhesion and migration. However, the PTPN12 expression and its prognostic significance in HCC have not been well elucidated.In this study, tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry (IHC) was investigated in an HCC cohort with adjacent liver tissues as controls. The resulting data were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves, Spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Our results showed that decreased expression of PTPN12 was more frequently observed in HCC tissues compared to the adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. Further correlation analyses indicated that the decreased PTPN12 expression was closely correlated with tumor recurrence (P = 0.015). Univariate analysis showed a significant association between decreased expression of PTPN12 and adverse cancer-specific survival and recurrence-free survival (P<0.001). In different subsets of overall patients, PTPN12 expression was also a prognostic indicator in patients with stage I/II or stage III/IV (P<0.05). Importantly, multivariate analysis (P<0.05) identified PTPN12 expression in HCC as an independent prognostic factor.Our findings provide a basis for the concept that PTPN12 protein expression is frequently decreased or lost in human HCC tissues and that decreased PTPN12 expression may represent an acquired recurrence phenotype of HCC and that PTPN12 expression may act as a biomarker of prognosis for patients with HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2044566531,"Meprins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, in which the cytokine IL-6 is a prominent effector molecule. Because IL-6 levels are elevated markedly in meprin α and α/β knockout mice in an experimental model of inflammatory bowel disease, the interaction between meprins and IL-6 was studied. The results demonstrate that rodent and human meprin A and B cleave IL-6 to a smaller product and, subsequently, are capable of extensive degradation of the cytokine. Analysis of the limited degradation product formed by meprin A indicated that three to five amino acids are removed from the C terminus of the cytokine. Meprin A and meprin B cleaved IL-6 with micromolar affinities (Km of 4.7 and 12.0 μm, respectively) and with high efficiencies (kcat/Km of 0.2 and 2.5 (m−1/s−1) × 106, respectively). These efficiency constants are among the highest for known meprin substrates. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transiently transfected with meprin α or meprin β constructs also cleave exogenous IL-6. Both human and murine IL-6 cleaved by meprin A or B are inactivated, as demonstrated by their decreased capability to stimulate proliferation of B9 cells. These results are consistent with the proposition that one function of meprin metalloproteases is to modulate inflammation by inactivating IL-6.

Meprin A and meprin B cleaved IL-6 with micromolar affinities (Km of 4.7 and 12.0 μm, respectively) and with high efficiencies (kcat/Km of 0.2 and 2.5 (m−1/s−1) × 106, respectively). These efficiency constants are among the highest for known meprin substrates. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transiently transfected with meprin α or meprin β constructs also cleave exogenous IL-6. Both human and murine IL-6 cleaved by meprin A or B are inactivated, as demonstrated by their decreased capability to stimulate proliferation of B9 cells. These results are consistent with the proposition that one function of meprin metalloproteases is to modulate inflammation by inactivating IL-6."
https://openalex.org/W2117731863,"Differentiated paediatric epithelial cells can be used to study the role of epithelial cells in asthma. Nasal epithelial cells are easier to obtain and may act as a surrogate for bronchial epithelium in asthma studies. We assessed the suitability of nasal epithelium from asthmatic children to be a surrogate for bronchial epithelium using air-liquid interface cultures.Paired nasal and bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic children (n = 9) were differentiated for 28 days under unstimulated and IL-13-stimulated conditions. Morphological and physiological markers were analysed using immunocytochemistry, transepithelial-electrical-resistance, Quantitative Real-time-PCR, ELISA and multiplex cytokine/chemokine analysis.Physiologically, nasal epithelial cells from asthmatic children exhibit similar cytokine responses to stimulation with IL-13 compared with paired bronchial epithelial cells. Morphologically however, nasal epithelial cells differed significantly from bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients under unstimulated and IL-13-stimulated conditions. Nasal epithelial cells exhibited lower proliferation/differentiation rates and lower percentages of goblet and ciliated cells when unstimulated, while exhibiting a diminished and varied response to IL-13.We conclude that morphologically, nasal epithelial cells would not be a suitable surrogate due to a significantly lower rate of proliferation and differentiation of goblet and ciliated cells. Physiologically, nasal epithelial cells respond similarly to exogenous stimulation with IL-13 in cytokine production and could be used as a physiological surrogate in the event that bronchial epithelial cells are not available."
https://openalex.org/W2035768743,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a widely abused amphetamine analog. Few studies have investigated the molecular effects of METH exposure in adult animals. Herein, we determined the consequences of an injection of METH (10 mg/kg) on transcriptional effects of a second METH (2.5 mg/kg) injection given one month later. We thus measured gene expression by microarray analyses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of 4 groups of rats euthanized 2 hours after the second injection: saline-pretreated followed by saline-challenged (SS) or METH-challenged (SM); and METH-pretreated followed by saline-challenged (MS) or METH-challenged (MM). Microarray analyses revealed that METH (2.5 mg/kg) produced acute changes (1.8-fold; P<0.01) in the expression of 412 (352 upregulated, 60 down-regulated) transcripts including cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript, corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh), oxytocin (Oxt), and vasopressin (Avp) that were upregulated. Injection of METH (10 mg/kg) altered the expression of 503 (338 upregulated, 165 down-regulated) transcripts measured one month later (MS group). These genes also included Cart and Crh. The MM group showed altered expression of 766 (565 upregulated, 201 down-regulated) transcripts including Avp, Cart, and Crh. The METH-induced increased Crh expression was enhanced in the MM group in comparison to SM and MS groups. Quantitative PCR confirmed the METH-induced changes in mRNA levels. Therefore, a single injection of METH produced long-lasting changes in gene expression in the rodent NAc. The long-term increases in Crh, Cart, and Avp mRNA expression suggest that METH exposure produced prolonged activation of the endogenous stress system. The METH-induced changes in oxytocin expression also suggest the possibility that this neuropeptide might play a significant role in the neuroplastic and affiliative effects of this drug."
https://openalex.org/W2039452086,"Premature infants exhibit widespread insults and delays in white matter maturation that can be sensitively detected early using diffusion tensor imaging. Diffusion tensor tractography facilitates in vivo visualization of white matter tracts and has the potential to be more sensitive than simpler two-dimensional DTI-based measures. However, the reliability and reproducibility of performing tractography for major white matter tracts in preterm infants is not known. The main objective of our study was to develop highly reliable and repeatable methods for ten white matter tracts in extremely low birth weight infants (birth weight ≤ 1000 g) at term-equivalent age. To demonstrate clinical utility, we also compared fiber microstructural and macrostructural parameters between preterm and healthy term controls. Twenty-nine ELBW infants and a control group of 15 healthy term newborns were studied. A team of researchers experienced in neuroanatomy/neuroimaging established the manual segmentation protocol based on a priori anatomical knowledge and an extensive training period to identify sources of variability. Intra- and inter-rater reliability and repeatability was tested using intra-class correlation coefficient, within-subject standard deviation (SD), repeatability, and Dice similarity index. Our results support our primary goal of developing highly reliable and reproducible comprehensive methods for manual segmentation of 10 white matter tracts in ELBW infants. The within-subject SD was within 1-2% and repeatability within 3-7% of the mean values for all 10 tracts. The intra-rater Dice index was excellent with a range of 0.97 to 0.99, and as expected, the inter-rater Dice index was lower (range: 0.80 to 0.91), but still within a very good reliability range. ELBW infants exhibited fewer fiber numbers and/or abnormal microstructure in a majority of the ten quantified tracts, consistent with injury/delayed development. This protocol could serve as a valuable tool for prompt evaluation of the impact of neuroprotective therapies and as a prognostic biomarker for neurodevelopmental impairments."
https://openalex.org/W2046150182,"Recent studies have described the bacterial community residing in the guts of giant pandas, together with the presence of lignocellulolytic enzymes. However, a more comprehensive understanding of the intestinal microbial composition and its functional capacity in giant pandas remains a major goal. Here, we conducted a comparison of bacterial, fungal and homoacetogenic microbial communities from fecal samples taken from two geriatric and two adult captive giant pandas. 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing revealed that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria are the most abundant microbiota in both geriatric and adult giant pandas. However, members of phylum Actinobacteria found in adult giant pandas were absent in their geriatric counterparts. Similarly, ITS1 amplicon pyrosequencing identified developmental changes in the most abundant fungal classes from Sordariomycetes in adult pandas to Saccharomycetes in geriatric pandas. Geriatric pandas exhibited significantly higher abundance of a potential probiotic fungus (Candida tropicalis) as compared to adult pandas, indicating their importance in the normal digestive physiology of aged pandas. Our study also reported the presence of a lignocellulolytic white-rot fungus, Perenniporia medulla-panis, and the evidence of novel homoacetogens residing in the guts of giant pandas."
https://openalex.org/W2006062744,"In our daily lives, auditory stream segregation allows us to differentiate concurrent sound sources and to make sense of the scene we are experiencing. However, a combination of segregation and the concurrent integration of auditory streams is necessary in order to analyze the relationship between streams and thus perceive a coherent auditory scene. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigates the relative role and neural underpinnings of these listening strategies in multi-part musical stimuli. We compare a real human performance of a piano duet and a synthetic stimulus of the same duet in a prioritized integrative attention paradigm that required the simultaneous segregation and integration of auditory streams. In so doing, we manipulate the degree to which the attended part of the duet led either structurally (attend melody vs. attend accompaniment) or temporally (asynchronies vs. no asynchronies between parts), and thus the relative contributions of integration and segregation used to make an assessment of the leader-follower relationship. We show that perceptually the relationship between parts is biased towards the conventional structural hierarchy in western music in which the melody generally dominates (leads) the accompaniment. Moreover, the assessment varies as a function of both cognitive load, as shown through difficulty ratings and the interaction of the temporal and the structural relationship factors. Neurally, we see that the temporal relationship between parts, as one important cue for stream segregation, revealed distinct neural activity in the planum temporale. By contrast, integration used when listening to both the temporally separated performance stimulus and the temporally fused synthetic stimulus resulted in activation of the intraparietal sulcus. These results support the hypothesis that the planum temporale and IPS are key structures underlying the mechanisms of segregation and integration of auditory streams, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2033206699,"Different DNA aberrations processes can cause colorectal cancer (CRC). Herein, we conducted a comprehensive molecular characterization of 27 CRCs from Iranian patients.Array CGH was performed. The MSI phenotype and the methylation status of 15 genes was established using MSP. The CGH data was compared to two established lists of 41 and 68 cancer genes, respectively, and to CGH data from African Americans. A maximum parsimony cladogram based on global aberrations was established.The number of aberrations seem to depend on the MSI status. MSI-H tumors displayed the lowest number of aberrations. MSP revealed that most markers were methylated, except RNF182 gene. P16 and MLH1 genes were primarily methylated in MSI-H tumors. Seven markers with moderate to high frequency of methylation (SYNE1, MMP2, CD109, EVL, RET, LGR and PTPRD) had very low levels of chromosomal aberrations. All chromosomes were targeted by aberrations with deletions more frequent than amplifications. The most amplified markers were CD248, ERCC6, ERGIC3, GNAS, MMP2, NF1, P2RX7, SFRS6, SLC29A1 and TBX22. Most deletions were noted for ADAM29, CHL1, CSMD3, FBXW7, GALNS, MMP2, NF1, PRKD1, SMAD4 and TP53. Aberrations targeting chromosome X were primarily amplifications in male patients and deletions in female patients. A finding similar to what we reported for African American CRC patients.This first comprehensive analysis of CRC Iranian tumors reveals a high MSI rate. The MSI tumors displayed the lowest level of chromosomal aberrations but high frequency of methylation. The MSI-L were predominantly targeted with chromosomal instability in a way similar to the MSS tumors. The global chromosomal aberration profiles showed many similarities with other populations but also differences that might allow a better understanding of CRC's clinico-pathological specifics in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2093416659,"Targeting effector molecules to tumor cells is a promising mode of action for cancer therapy and diagnostics. Binding proteins with high affinity and specificity for a tumor target that carry effector molecules such as toxins, cytokines, or radiolabels to their intended site of action are required for these applications. In order to yield high tumor accumulation while maintaining low levels in healthy tissues and blood, the half-life of such conjugates needs to be in an optimal range.

Monoclonal antibodies represent the best characterized class of biopharmaceuticals with broad applications in diagnostic and therapy. To date, over 30 antibodies have been approved in the United States and Europe for treatment of immunological and neoplastic diseases (1.Reichert J.M. Marketed therapeutic antibodies compendium.mAbs. 2012; 4: 413-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Despite this track record, therapeutic antibodies have some restrictions mainly due to their complex structure and size (2.Chames P. Van Regenmortel M. Weiss E. Baty D. Therapeutic antibodies. Successes, limitations and hopes for the future.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 157: 220-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The complexity of antibodies based on their multimeric character, numerous disulfide bonds, and posttranslational modifications limits their utility for multispecific and targeting approaches. In addition, due to the large size, slow blood clearance, and prolonged retention time also in non-tumor tissues, antibodies are less suited for therapeutic areas such as tumor imaging or radioimmunotherapy, which require high tumor/blood ratios. Scaffold-based technologies may be applied to overcome these limitations. These technologies are focused on genetic engineering of small and less complex proteins of human or non-human origin to yield optimal properties regarding target binding, stability, modularity, and manufacturability in microorganisms. Due to the superior thermodynamic stability of scaffold proteins, multiple amino acid substitutions creating a target binding area of sufficient size are generally well tolerated without significant perturbation of the protein fold. Using this approach, proteins with high affinity and specificity against many different targets have been generated (3.Hey T. Fiedler E. Rudolph R. Fiedler M.

Several scaffolds, such as Affibody®, Adnectin, and DARPin molecules, are currently under clinical evaluation (6.Baum R.P. Prasad V. Müller D. Schuchardt C. Orlova A. Wennborg A. Tolmachev V.

Thus, compared with antibodies, the hallmark of scaffolds consists in a reduced complexity at all levels from structure, genetic manipulation, biochemical handling through to GMP production, and analytics combined with excellent biophysical properties and ease of modular molecule designs. We identified ubiquitin as an ideal scaffold protein for the generation of target-binding molecules. Ubiquitin is a small protein consisting of a single polypeptide chain of 76 amino acids folded in a highly compact α/β structure (9.Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. Structure of ubiquitin refined at 1.8 Å resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). Its outstanding biochemical properties (i.e. high solubility, temperature, pH, and proteolytic stability) make it well suited for genetic engineering (10.Jackson S.E. Ubiquitin. A small protein folding paradigm.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2006; 4: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes. It is mainly known as a cytosolic protein involved in numerous intracellular regulatory processes (11.Hirsch C. Gauss R. Horn S.C. Neuber O. Sommer T. The ubiquitylation machinery of the endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 2009; 458: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 12.Bergink S. Jentsch S.

The ESCRT machinery in endosomal sorting of ubiquitylated membrane proteins.Nature. 2009; 458: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). However, ubiquitin also circulates in the blood of healthy humans in significant concentrations of approximately 100 ng/ml (14.Majetschak M. Extracellular ubiquitin. Immune modulator and endogenous opponent of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2011; 89: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both extracellular and intracellular ubiquitin pools contain monomeric and multimeric proteins comprising a high diversity of differentially branched or linear polyubiquitin chains of variable length (15.Takada K. Nasu H. Hibi N. Tsukada Y. Shibasaki T. Fujise K. Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. Ohkawa K. Serum concentrations of free ubiquitin and multiubiquitin chains.Clin.

Ubiquitin is reported to act as agonist of the CX chemokine receptor 4 with an affinity in the medium nanomolar range (17.Saini V. Staren D.M. Ziarek J.J. Nashaat Z.N. Campbell E.M. Volkman B.F. Marchese A. Majetschak M. The CXC chemokine receptor 4 ligands ubiquitin and stromal cell-derived factor-1α function through distinct receptor interactions.J. Biol.

However, the biological function of extracellular ubiquitin remains to be determined. From preclinical studies, some evidence has been presented that extracellular ubiquitin may function as an endogenous immune modulator with anti-inflammatory properties in trauma models but not in healthy animals (20.Majetschak M. Krehmeier U. Bardenheuer M. Denz C. Quintel M. Voggenreiter G. Obertacke U.

Initial assessment of the role of CXC chemokine receptor 4 after polytrauma.Mol. Med. 2012; 18: 1056-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exogenous bolus applications of ubiquitin to healthy animals neither induced treatment-related toxicological effects nor influenced immunological functions or hematological parameters (23.Majetschak M. Cohn S.M. Obertacke U. Proctor K.G. Therapeutic potential of exogenous ubiquitin during resuscitation from severe trauma.J.

Therefore, the proposed immune modulatory function of systemic ubiquitin still needs to be clarified. In addition, strongly varying levels of ubiquitin in serum of healthy persons as well as patients (20.Majetschak M. Krehmeier U. Bardenheuer M. Denz C. Quintel M. Voggenreiter G. Obertacke U. Extracellular ubiquitin inhibits the TNF-α response to endotoxin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and regulates endotoxin hyporesponsiveness in critical illness.Blood. 2003; 101: 1882-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggest that systemic ubiquitin is highly dynamic. Based on these considerations, a certain tolerability of administered ubiquitin and, potentially, of its derivatives is expected.

ED-B is normally absent in almost all adult tissues but is specifically expressed during wound healing and inflammation and in most cancer entities (26.Menrad A. Menssen H.D. ED-B fibronectin as a target for antibody-based cancer treatments.Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2005; 9: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hence, ED-B has been considered as a promising cancer target for selective labeling of tumor vasculature and stroma, either for imaging purposes or for tumor-targeted treatment. Several approaches to identify and characterize ED-B-binding molecules for cancer therapy or diagnostics have been described, utilizing both antibody and scaffold technologies (27.Johdi N.A.

Within the ubiquitin sequence, F45W, G75A, and G76A mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChangeII site-directed mutagenesis kit, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Based on in silico algorithms of the ubiquitin monomer calculating the stability effects of amino acid substitutions (37.Fiedler, M., Fiedler, U., Rudolph, R., (August 30, 1980) Generation of artificial binding proteins on the basis of ubiquitin proteins. International Patent Application WO/2004/106368Google Scholar) and focusing on surface-exposed residues, nine amino acid positions were identified for randomization. A library constructed via linkage of two ubiquitin monomers was used for the selection of ED-B-binding molecules. The monomeric library modules SPW randomized at amino acid positions 2, 4, 6, and 62–66 and SPF randomized at amino acid positions 6′, 8′, and 62′–66′ were synthesized by Morphosys Slonomics (Martinsried, Germany) using a mixture of 19-amino acid coding premade double-stranded triplets excluding cysteine. Gene fragments of both library modules were used as template for a PCR introducing recognition sites for SfiI and EcoRI at the SPW module and MfeI and SfiI restriction sites at the SPF module, respectively. After digestion of the amplified fragments with EcoRI or MfeI, both fragments were ligated, yielding the linear SPWF library. The phagemid pCD87SA was provided by M. Paschke (38.Paschke M. Höhne W. A twin-arginine translocation (Tat)-mediated phage display system.Gene. 2005; 350: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The SPWF library and the phagemid were digested with SfiI and subsequently ligated. Aliquots of the ligation mixture were used for electroporation of Escherichia coli ElectroTen Blue cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Single colony PCR and sequence analysis of transformed bacteria were carried out to check for inserts of the correct size and sequence. Of all transformed clones, phagemid was purified using the QIAfilter® Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Thereafter, competent ER2738 cells (Lucigene, Middleton, WI) were electroporated with the phagemid library. Preparation of phage particles displaying variants of SPWF ubiquitin library was performed as described (39.Ebersbach H. Fiedler E. Scheuermann T. Fiedler M. Stubbs M.T. Reimann C. Proetzel G. Rudolph R. Fiedler U. Affilin-novel binding molecules based on human γ-B-crystallin, an all β-sheet protein.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A total of four panning rounds were conducted. For selection, N-terminal biotinylated 67B89 target protein (Nb67B89) was immobilized on Reacti-Bind Neutravidin strips (Pierce). A phage suspension of >1012 phages was added to the well of target-coated and preblocked Neutravidin strips and incubated in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of 6789 off-target. Wells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). Elution of bound phages was performed via pH shift achieved by incubation with a 200 mm glycine buffer adjusted to pH 2.2. For selection in solution, performed in the third and fourth round of panning, phage suspension was incubated with Nb67B89 in the presence of a 10-fold excess of 6789 off-target, followed by pull-down with Streptavidin beads (Invitrogen). Selection pressure was increased over the rounds via increasing washing stringency, reducing Nb67B89 target concentration and eluting via competition with an excess of 67B89 target. For hit screening of selected binding molecules, phagemids were prepared from E. coli culture, and SPWF inserts were subcloned into pPR-IBA1 expression vector (IBA-Solutions for Life Science, Göttingen, Germany), followed by transformation of electrocompetent NovaBlue (DE3) cells (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Single colonies were picked, and protein was expressed on a small scale. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBST and lysed in the presence of lysozyme via 3-fold freeze thaw cycles. Hit-ELISA was performed on a Biomek FX (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). A 10-fold dilution of the lysates in PBS was incubated with 67B89 and 6789 proteins coated on the wells of 96-well plates (MediSorpTM, Nalgene Nunc International, Penfield, NY). After washing with PBST, bound molecules were detected via anti-Ubi-Fab-POD (AbD Serotec, Oxfordshire, UK). Variants having a target/off-target binding of >2 and 100% sequence functionality were defined as hits. Ribosome display selection was used for affinity maturation. The SPW module of variant 19270, identified in phage display selection, was recombined with the SPF library module. Functional elements necessary for ribosome display selection were attached at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the library using standard cloning procedures. A total of four ribosome display cycles were performed (40.Zahnd C. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. Ribosome display. Selecting and evolving proteins in vitro that specifically bind to a target.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and translation were realized using the PureExpress® in vitro protein synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). For selection in solution, ternary complexes were incubated with Nb67B89 in PBSMT (PBS supplemented with 30 mm magnesium acetate and 0.05% Tween 20) in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of 6789. Target-bound ternary complexes were recovered by incubation with Streptavidin beads. Selection of high affinity and specific binding molecules was supported by several washings with PBSMT. mRNA obtained after resolution of ternary complexes was reverse transcribed. The derived library was reamplified in two PCRs, restoring the functional modules necessary for the next ribosome display cycle. Selection pressure over all ribosome display cycles was increased by reducing the duration of target incubation and increasing washing stringency. After the fourth round, enriched binding molecules were subcloned and expressed as described above. Single colonies were analyzed for target/off-target binding in a lysate-based hit-ELISA (see above) with or without preincubation of lysates in mouse serum. Variants having a target/off-target binding ratio of >10, preservation of binding activity after serum incubation of >70, and 100% sequence functionality were defined as hits. Based on variant 46877, another maturation was performed with the aim of increasing thermal stability and solubility. All variable positions were separately rerandomized by PCR using primer pairs containing an NNK triplet at the indicated single amino acid position. The obtained pool of variants was directly subcloned into pPR-IBA1 and transferred into electrocompetent NovaBlue (DE3) cells. Single colonies were picked, and protein was expressed and lysed as described above. For identification of heat-stable variants, lysates were incubated for 2 h at 50 °C before ELISA on target and off-target was performed. Protein expression was determined from lysate fractions by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE Novex 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen). To further increase expression yield and stability, an F63P exchange was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into variants 65137, 65347, and 65351, identified in ribosome display maturation. Based on the published DNA sequence (Uniprot ID P02751, isoform 7, sequence 1080–1541), genes for ED-B containing 67B89 and off-target 6789 proteins were obtained via gene synthesis (Geneart, Regensburg, Germany). For production of tag-free proteins, 67B89 and 6789 were cloned into pET28a expression vector and subsequently transferred into electrocompetent HMS174 (DE3) cells (Merck4Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany). Following protein expression and cell harvest, the cell pellet was solubilized, and the protein was purified via a Q-Sepharose FF column, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and a Phenyl HP and Q Sepharose HP column. All chromatographic purification steps were carried out on Äkta chromatography systems (GE Healthcare). For production of 67B89thc and 6789thc proteins, target and off-target genes were subcloned into pET20b vector (Merck4Biosciences), followed by C-terminal insertion of a G4SCP sequence. After transformation of NovaBlue (DE3) cells and protein expression, cell pellets were lysed, and protein in the supernatant was purified via immobilized metal affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (5 ml; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and on a Superdex 75 16/600 column. For a preferentially N-terminal biotinylation, 67B89 protein was dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. A 10-fold molar excess of the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin biotinylation reagent (Pierce) was added to 200 μl of a 1.4 mg/ml protein solution, followed by incubation for 24 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 120 volume of 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, was added, and the final solution was dialyzed against PBS. Binding molecules subcloned into pPR-IBA1 were expressed as proteins with C-terminal Strep-tag in NovaBlue (DE3) cells on a 1-liter scale. After cell lysis and lysate clarification, the supernatant was purified via a StrepTactin Super Flow column (IBA-Solutions for Life Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequent size exclusion chromatography was realized in PBS, pH 7.4, on a Superdex 75 pg 16/600 column. For the production of tag-free binding protein 77405, the coding DNA for 77405 was subcloned into pET-Sumoadapt vector (42.Bosse-Doenecke E. Weininger U. Gopalswamy M. Balbach J. Knudsen S.M. Rudolph R. High yield production of recombinant native and modified peptides exemplified by ligands for G-protein coupled receptors.Protein Expr.

Following expression, the binding protein was purified from the cell lysate via immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The His6-SUM"
https://openalex.org/W1978183858,"Capsid surface shielding of adenovirus vectors with synthetic polymers is an emerging technology to reduce unwanted interactions of the vector particles with cellular and non-cellular host components. While it has been shown that attachment of shielding polymers allows prevention of undesired interactions, it has become evident that a shield which is covalently attached to the vector surface can negatively affect gene transfer efficiency. Reasons are not only a limited receptor-binding ability of the shielded vectors but also a disturbance of intracellular trafficking processes, the latter depending on the interaction of the vector surface with the cellular transport machinery. A solution might be the development of bioresponsive shields that are stably maintained outside the host cell but released upon cell entry to allow for efficient gene delivery to the nucleus. Here we provide a systematic comparison of irreversible versus bioresponsive shields based on synthetic N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers. In addition, the chemical strategy used for generation of the shield allowed for a traceless bioresponsive shielding, i.e., polymers could be released from the vector particles without leaving residual linker residues. Our data demonstrated that only a bioresponsive shield maintained the high gene transfer efficiency of adenovirus vectors both in vitro and in vivo. As an example for bioresponsive HPMA copolymer release, we analyzed the in vivo gene transfer in the liver. We demonstrated that both the copolymer's charge and the mode of shielding (irreversible versus traceless bioresponsive) profoundly affected liver gene transfer and that traceless bioresponsive shielding with positively charged HPMA copolymers mediated FX independent transduction of hepatocytes. In addition, we demonstrated that shielding with HPMA copolymers can mediate a prolonged blood circulation of vector particles in mice. Our results have significant implications for the future design of polymer-shielded Ad and provide a deeper insight into the interaction of shielded adenovirus vector particles with the host after systemic delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2002080876,"We recently found that older adults show reduced learning rates when learning a new pattern of coordinated rhythmic movement. The purpose of this study was to extend that finding by examining the performance of all ages across the lifespan from the 20 s through to the 80 s to determine how learning rates change with age. We tested whether adults could learn to produce a novel coordinated rhythmic movement (90° relative phase) in a visually guided unimanual task. We determined learning rates to quantify changes in learning with age and to determine at what ages the changes occur. We found, as before, that learning rates of participants in their 70 s and 80 s were half those of participants in their 20 s. We also found a gradual slow decline in learning rate with age until approximately age 50, when there was a sudden drop to a reduced learning rate for the 60 though 80 year olds. We discuss possible causes for the “50 s cliff” in perceptuo-motor learning rates and suggest that age related deficits in perception of complex motions may be the key to understanding this result."
https://openalex.org/W1969227078,"Here we investigate the role of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-2α in coordinating the development of retinal astrocytic and vascular networks. Three Cre mouse lines were used to disrupt floxed Hif-2α, including Rosa26CreERT2, Tie2Cre, and GFAPCre. Global Hif-2α disruption by Rosa26CreERT2 led to reduced astrocytic and vascular development in neonatal retinas, whereas endothelial disruption by Tie2Cre had no apparent effects. Hif-2α deletion in astrocyte progenitors by GFAPCre significantly interfered with the development of astrocytic networks, which failed to reach the retinal periphery and were incapable of supporting vascular development. Perplexingly, the abundance of strongly GFAP+ mature astrocytes transiently increased at P0 before they began to lag behind the normal controls by P3. Pax2+ and PDGFRα+ astrocytic progenitors and immature astrocytes were dramatically diminished at all stages examined. Despite decreased number of astrocyte progenitors, their proliferation index or apoptosis was not altered. The above data can be reconciled by proposing that HIF-2α is required for maintaining the supply of astrocyte progenitors by slowing down their differentiation into non-proliferative mature astrocytes. HIF-2α deficiency in astrocyte progenitors may accelerate their differentiation into astrocytes, a change which greatly interferes with the replenishment of astrocyte progenitors due to insufficient time for proliferation. Rapidly declining progenitor supply may lead to premature cessation of astrocyte development. Given that HIF-2α protein undergoes oxygen dependent degradation, an interesting possibility is that retinal blood vessels may regulate astrocyte differentiation through their oxygen delivery function. While our findings support the consensus that retinal astrocytic template guides vascular development, they also raise the possibility that astrocytic and vascular networks may mutually regulate each other's development, mediated at least in part by HIF-2α."
https://openalex.org/W2021547007,"Background We explored the theorized upregulation of platelet-activating factor (PAF)– mediated biologic responses following lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) inhibition using human platelet aggregation studies in an in vitro experiment and in 2 clinical trials. Methods and Results Full platelet aggregation concentration response curves were generated in vitro to several platelet agonists in human plasma samples pretreated with rilapladib (selective Lp-PLA2 inhibitor) or vehicle. This was followed by a randomized, double-blind crossover study in healthy adult men (n = 26) employing a single-agonist dose assay of platelet aggregation, after treatment of subjects with 250 mg oral rilapladib or placebo once daily for 14 days. This study was followed by a second randomized, double-blind parallel-group trial in healthy adult men (n = 58) also treated with 250 mg oral rilapladib or placebo once daily for 14 days using a full range of 10 collagen concentrations (0–10 µg/ml) for characterizing EC50 values for platelet aggregation for each subject. Both clinical studies were conducted at the GlaxoSmithKline Medicines Research Unit in the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia. EC50 values derived from multiple agonist concentrations were compared and no pro-aggregant signals were observed during exposure to rilapladib in any of these platelet studies, despite Lp-PLA2 inhibition exceeding 90%. An increase in collagen-mediated aggregation was observed 3 weeks post drug termination in the crossover study (15.4% vs baseline; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9–27.0), which was not observed during the treatment phase and was not observed in the parallel-group study employing a more robust EC50 examination. Conclusions Lp-PLA2 inhibition does not enhance platelet aggregation. Trial Registration 1) Study 1: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01745458 2) Study 2: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00387257"
https://openalex.org/W2031180692,"Multiple myeloma, the second most common hematological cancer, is currently incurable due to refractory disease relapse and development of multiple drug resistance. We and others recently established the biophysical model that myeloma initiating (stem) cells (MICs) trigger the stiffening of their niches via SDF-1/CXCR4 paracrine; The stiffened niches then promote the colonogenesis of MICs and protect them from drug treatment. In this work we examined in silico the pharmaceutical potential of targeting MIC niche stiffness to facilitate cytotoxic chemotherapies. We first established a multi-scale agent-based model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to recapitulate the niche stiffness centric, pro-oncogenetic positive feedback loop between MICs and myeloma-associated bone marrow stromal cells (MBMSCs), and investigated the effects of such intercellular chemo-physical communications on myeloma development. Then we used AMD3100 (to interrupt the interactions between MICs and their stroma) and Bortezomib (a recently developed novel therapeutic agent) as representative drugs to examine if the biophysical properties of myeloma niches are drugable. Results showed that our model recaptured the key experimental observation that the MBMSCs were more sensitive to SDF-1 secreted by MICs, and provided stiffer niches for these initiating cells and promoted their proliferation and drug resistance. Drug synergism analysis suggested that AMD3100 treatment undermined the capability of MICs to modulate the bone marrow microenvironment, and thus re-sensitized myeloma to Bortezomib treatments. This work is also the first attempt to virtually visualize in 3D the dynamics of the bone marrow stiffness during myeloma development. In summary, we established a multi-scale model to facilitate the translation of the niche-stiffness centric myeloma model as well as experimental observations to possible clinical applications. We concluded that targeting the biophysical properties of stem cell niches is of high clinical potential since it may re-sensitize tumor initiating cells to chemotherapies and reduce risks of cancer relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2035682070,"Nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells can be induced by oocyte factors. Despite numerous attempts, the factors responsible for successful nuclear reprogramming remain elusive. In the present study, we found that porcine oocytes with the first polar body collected at 42 h of in vitro maturation had a stronger ability to support early development of cloned embryos than porcine oocytes with the first polar body collected at 33 h of in vitro maturation. To explore the key reprogramming factors responsible for the difference, we compared proteome signatures of the two groups of oocytes. 18 differentially expressed proteins between these two groups of oocytes were discovered by mass spectrometry (MS). Among these proteins, we especially focused on vimentin (VIM). A certain amount of VIM protein was stored in oocytes and accumulated during oocyte maturation, and maternal VIM was specifically incorporated into transferred somatic nuclei during nuclear reprogramming. When maternal VIM function was inhibited by anti-VIM antibody, the rate of cloned embryos developing to blastocysts was significantly lower than that of IgG antibody-injected embryos and non-injected embryos (12.24 versus 22.57 and 21.10%; p < 0.05), but the development of in vitro fertilization and parthenogenetic activation embryos was not affected. Furthermore, we found that DNA double strand breaks dramatically increased and that the p53 pathway was activated in cloned embryos when VIM function was inhibited.

https://openalex.org/W2036494797,"The lexical approach is a method in differential psychology that uses people's estimations of verbal descriptors of human behavior in order to derive the structure of human individuality. The validity of the assumptions of this method about the objectivity of people's estimations is rarely questioned. Meanwhile the social nature of language and the presence of emotionality biases in cognition are well-recognized in psychology. A question remains, however, as to whether such an emotionality-capacities bias is strong enough to affect semantic perception of verbal material. For the lexical approach to be valid as a method of scientific investigations, such biases should not exist in semantic perception of the verbal material that is used by this approach. This article reports on two studies investigating differences between groups contrasted by 12 temperament traits (i.e. by energetic and other capacities, as well as emotionality) in the semantic perception of very general verbal material. Both studies contrasted the groups by a variety of capacities: endurance, lability and emotionality separately in physical, social-verbal and mental aspects of activities. Hypotheses of “background emotionality” and a “projection through capacities” were supported. Non-evaluative criteria for categorization (related to complexity, organization, stability and probability of occurrence of objects) followed the polarity of evaluative criteria, and did not show independence from this polarity. Participants with stronger physical or social endurance gave significantly more positive ratings to a variety of concepts, and participants with faster physical tempo gave more positive ratings to timing-related concepts. The results suggest that people's estimations of lexical material related to human behavior have emotionality, language- and dynamical capacities-related biases and therefore are unreliable. This questions the validity of the lexical approach as a method for the objective study of stable individual differences."
https://openalex.org/W2032627392,"End-of-life cancer patients commonly receive more than one type of strong opioid. The three-step analgesic ladder framework of the World Health Organisation (WHO) provides no guidance on multiple opioid prescribing and there is little epidemiological data available to inform practice. This study aims to investigate the time trend of such cases and the associated factors.Strong opioid prescribing in the last three months of life of cancer patients were extracted from the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). The outcome variable was the number of different types of prescribed non-rescue doses of opioids (1 vs 2-4, referred to as a complex case). Associated factors were evaluated using prevalence ratios (PR) derived from multivariate log-binomial model, adjusting for clustering effects and potential confounding variables.Overall, 26.4% (95% CI: 25.6-27.1%) of 13,427 cancer patients (lung 41.7%, colorectal 19.1%, breast 18.6%, prostate 15.5%, head and neck 5.0%) were complex cases. Complex cases increased steadily over the study period (1.02% annually, 95%CI: 0.42-1.61%, p = 0.048) but with a small dip (7.5% reduction, 95%CI: -0.03 to 17.8%) around the period of the Shipman case, a British primary care doctor who murdered his patients with opioids. The dip significantly affected the correlation of the complex cases with persistent increasing background opioid prescribing (weighted correlation coefficients pre-, post-Shipman periods: 0.98(95%CI: 0.67-1.00), p = 0.011; 0.14 (95%CI: -0.85 to 0.91), p = 0.85). Multivariate adjusted analysis showed that the complex cases were predominantly associated with year of death (PRs vs 2000: 1.05-1.65), not other demographic and clinical factors except colorectal cancer (PR vs lung cancer: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.12-1.37).These findings suggest that prescribing behaviour, rather than patient factors, plays an important role in multiple opioid prescribing at the end of life; highlighting the need for training and education that goes beyond the well-recognised WHO approach for clinical practitioners."

To inform future prevention research, we undertook a study in the provincial capital (Beira) to measure HIV incidence in women at higher risk of HIV and assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining them as research participants.Women age 18-35 were recruited from schools and places where women typically meet potential sexual partners. Eligibility criteria included HIV-seronegative status and self-report of at least 2 sexual partners in the last month. History of injection drug use was an exclusion criterion, but pregnancy was not. Participants were scheduled for monthly follow-up for 12 months, when they underwent face-to-face interviews, HIV counseling and testing, and pregnancy testing.387 women were eligible and contributed follow-up data. Most were from 18-24 years old (median 21). Around one-third of participants (33.8%) reported at least one new sexual partner in the last month. Most women (65.5%) reported not using a modern method of contraception at baseline. Twenty-two women seroconverted for a prospective HIV incidence of 6.5 per 100 woman-years (WY; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.1-9.9). Factors associated with HIV seroconversion in the multivariable analysis were: number of vaginal sex acts without using condoms with partners besides primary partner in the last 7 days (hazard ratio (HR) 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2-2.5) and using a form of contraception at baseline other than hormonal or condoms (vs. no method; HR 25.3; 95% CI: 2.5-253.5). The overall retention rate was 80.0% for the entire follow-up period.We found a high HIV incidence in a cohort of young women reporting risky sexual behavior in Beira, Mozambique. HIV prevention programs should be strengthened. Regular HIV testing and condom use should be encouraged, particularly among younger women with multiple sexual partners."
https://openalex.org/W2019208600,"Anaplastic astrocytoma (AA; Grade III) and glioblastoma (GBM; Grade IV) are diffusely infiltrating tumors and are called malignant astrocytomas. The treatment regimen and prognosis are distinctly different between anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma patients. Although histopathology based current grading system is well accepted and largely reproducible, intratumoral histologic variations often lead to difficulties in classification of malignant astrocytoma samples. In order to obtain a more robust molecular classifier, we analysed RT-qPCR expression data of 175 differentially regulated genes across astrocytoma using Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM) and found the most discriminatory 16-gene expression signature for the classification of anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma. The 16-gene signature obtained in the training set was validated in the test set with diagnostic accuracy of 89%. Additionally, validation of the 16-gene signature in multiple independent cohorts revealed that the signature predicted anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma samples with accuracy rates of 99%, 88%, and 92% in TCGA, GSE1993 and GSE4422 datasets, respectively. The protein-protein interaction network and pathway analysis suggested that the 16-genes of the signature identified epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway as the most differentially regulated pathway in glioblastoma compared to anaplastic astrocytoma. In addition to identifying 16 gene classification signature, we also demonstrated that genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition may play an important role in distinguishing glioblastoma from anaplastic astrocytoma."

https://openalex.org/W2096147708,"Background The metabolic effect of fructose in sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) has been linked to de novo lipogenesis and uric acid (UA) production. Objectives This study investigated the biological effects of SSB consumption on serum lipid profiles and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) among Taiwanese adolescents. Methods We evaluated the anthropometric parameters and biochemical outcomes of 200 representative adolescents (98 boys and 102 girls) who were randomly selected from a large-scale cross-sectional study. Data were analyzed using multiple regression models adjusted for covariates. Results Increased SSB consumption was associated with increased waist and hip circumferences, body mass index (BMI) values and serum UA, triglyceride (TG) and RBP4 levels. Adolescents who consumed >500 ml/day of beverages half-to-heavily sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) exhibited TG and RBP4 levels 22.7 mg/dl and 13.92 ng/ml higher than non-drinkers, respectively. HFCS drinkers with hyperuricemia had higher TG levels than HFCS drinkers with normal UA levels (98.6 vs. 81.6 mg/dl). The intake of HFCS-rich SSBs and high value of BMI (≥24) interactively reinforced RBP4 levels among overweight/obese adolescents. Circulating RBP4 levels were significantly correlated with weight-related outcomes and TG and UA concentration among HFCS drinkers (r = 0.253 to 0.404), but not among non-drinkers. Conclusions High-quantity HFCS-rich beverage consumption is associated with higher TG and RBP4 levels. Hyperuricemia is likely to intensify the influence of HFCS-rich SSB intake on elevated TG levels, and in overweight and obese adolescents, high BMI may modify the action of fructose on higher circulating levels of RBP4."
https://openalex.org/W2170941626,"We focus on the role of CD8+ Treg cell in Intravenous methyl-prednisolone (IVMP) pulse therapy in forty patients with active Class III/IV childhood lupus nephritis (LN) with heavy proteinuria. IVMP therapy for five days. From peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and renal tissues, we saw IVMP therapy definitely restoring both CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ and CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cell number plus greater expression with intracellular IL-10 and granzyme B in CD8+FoxP3+ Treg from PBMCs. IVMP-treated CD8+CD25+ Treg cells directly suppressed CD4+ T proliferation and induced CD4+CD45RO+ apoptosis. Histologically, CD4+FoxP3+ as well as CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cells appeared in renal tissue of LN patients before IVMP by double immunohistochemical stain. CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cells increased in 10 follow-up renal biopsy specimens after IVMP. Reverse correlation of serum anti-C1q antibody and FoxP3+ Treg cells in PBMNCs (r = −0.714, P<0.01). After IVMP, serum anti-C1q antibody decrease accompanied increase of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells. CD8+Treg cells reduced interferon-r response in PBMCs to major peptide autoepitopes from nucleosomes after IVMP therapy; siRNA of FoxP3 suppressed granzyme B expression while decreasing CD8+CD25+Treg-induced CD4+CD45RO+ apoptosis. Renal activity of LN by SLEDAI-2k in childhood LN was significantly higher than two weeks after IVMP (P<0.01). CD8+FoxP3+ Treg cells return in post-IVMP therapy and exert crucial immune modulatory effect to control autoimmune response in LN. Trial Registration DMR97-IRB-259"
https://openalex.org/W2002510761,"Objectives This study aims to identify clinical case definitions of influenza with higher accuracy in patients stratified by age group and influenza activity using hospital-based surveillance system. Methods In seven tertiary hospitals across South Korea during 2011–2012 influenza season, respiratory specimens were obtained from patients presenting an influenza-like illness (ILI), defined as having fever plus at least one of following symptoms: cough, sore throat or rhinorrhea. Influenza was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify clinical variables with better relation with laboratory-confirmed influenza, and compared the accuracy of combinations. Results Over the study period, we enrolled 1417 patients, of which 647 had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Patients with cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat or headache were more likely to have influenza (p<0.05). The most accurate criterion across the study population was the combination of cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat and headache (sensitivity 71.3%, specificity 60.1% and AUROC 0.66). The combination of rhinorrhea, sore throat and sputum during the peak influenza activity period in the young age group showed higher accuracy than that using the whole population (sensitivity 89.3%, specificity 72.1%, and AUROC 0.81). Conclusions The accuracy of clinical case definitions of influenza differed across age groups and influenza activity periods. Categorizing the entire population into subgroups would improve the detection of influenza patients in the hospital-based surveillance system."
https://openalex.org/W2064975550,"Purpose The objective was to check if 520 days in confinement (MARS 500), may affect the main peripheral arterial diameter and wall thickness and the main vein size. Method Common carotid (CC) femoral artery (FA) portal vein (PV), jugular (JG), femoral vein (FV) and tibial vein were assessed during MARS 500 by echography, performed by the subjects. A hand free volumic echographic capture method and a delayed 3D reconstruction software developed by our lab were used for collecting and measuring the vascular parameters. Results During the MARS 500 experiment the subjects performed 6 sessions among which 80% of the echographic data were of sufficient quality to be processed. No significant change was found for the Common carotid, Jugular vein, femoral artery, femoral vein, portal vein, and tibial vein diameter. CC and FA IMT (intima media thickness) were found significantly increased (14% to 28% P<0.05) in all the 6 subjects, during the confinement period and also at +2 days after the confinement period, but there was no significant difference 6 month later compare to pre MARS 500. Conclusion The experiment confirmed that even untrained to performing echography the subjects were able to capture enough echographic data to reconstruct the vessel image from which the parameters were measured. The increase in both CC and FA IMT should be in relation with the stress generated by the confined environment or absence of solar radiation, as there was no change in gravity, temperature and air in the MARS 500 module, and minor changes in physical exercise and nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2039407737,"Caveolins are an essential component of cholesterol-rich invaginations of the plasma membrane known as caveolae. These flask-shaped, invaginated structures participate in a number of important cellular processes, including vesicular transport, cholesterol homeostasis, and signal transduction. We investigated the effects of CAV-1 on mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant enzymes in hypercholesterolemia-affected target organs. A total of eighteen male New Zealand white rabbits were divided into three groups: a normal-diet group, an untreated hypercholesterolemia-induced group, and a hypercholesterolemia-induced group that received intravenous administration of antennapedia-CAV-1 (AP-CAV-1) peptide every 2 days for 2 weeks. Serum biochemistry, CAV-1 distribution, neutral lipid distribution, mitochondrial morphology, biogenesis-mediated protein content, oxidative stress balance, antioxidant enzyme levels, and apoptotic cell death of liver tissue were analysed. Hepatic and circulating cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels differed significantly between the three groups (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical staining intensity of CAV-1 was greater in AP-CAV-1-treated rabbits than in untreated rabbits, especially in the vicinity of the liver vasculature. The high levels of neutral lipids, malondialdehyde, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactive 1α (PGC-1α), and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) seen in untreated hypercholesteremic animals were attenuated by administration of AP-CAV-1 (P<0.05). In addition, mitochondria in animals that received treatment exhibited darker electron-dense matrix and integrated cristae. Furthermore, the levels of ROS modulator 1 (Romo1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-2, as well as catalase activity were significantly lower in CAV-1-treated hypercholesterolemic rabbits (P<0.05). AP-CAV-1 treatment also restored mitochondrial respiratory chain subunit protein content (OXPHOS complexes I-V), thereby preserving mitochondrial function (P<0.05). Furthermore, AP-CAV-1 treatment significantly suppressed apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by a reduction in the number of TUNEL-positive cells. Our results indirectly indicate that CAV-1 mediates the negative effects of PGC-1α on hepatic mitochondrial respiratory chain function, promotes the antioxidant enzyme defence system, and maintains mitochondrial biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2037335952,"HIV-1, an enveloped RNA virus, produces viral particles that are known to be much more heterogeneous in size than is typical of non-enveloped viruses. We present here a novel strategy to study HIV-1 Viral Like Particles (VLP) assembly by measuring the size distribution of these purified VLPs and subsequent viral cores thanks to Atomic Force Microscopy imaging and statistical analysis. This strategy allowed us to identify whether the presence of viral RNA acts as a modulator for VLPs and cores size heterogeneity in a large population of particles. These results are analyzed in the light of a recently proposed statistical physics model for the self-assembly process. In particular, our results reveal that the modulation of size distribution by the presence of viral RNA is qualitatively reproduced, suggesting therefore an entropic origin for the modulation of RNA uptake by the nascent VLP."
https://openalex.org/W1987035765,"Background We investigated the detection of chlamydia at different stages of the menstrual cycle. Methods Electronic medical records for women attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre between March 2011 and 31st December 2012, who were tested for chlamydia by nucleic acid amplification of high vaginal, cervical, or urinary samples, and who recorded a date of last normal menstrual period (LNMP) between 0–28 days were included in the analysis. Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of chlamydia with menstrual cycle adjusted by demographics and behavioural variables. Chlamydia and beta globin load were determined on those with stored samples. Results Of the 10,017 consultations that included a test for chlamydia and a valid LNMP, there were 417 in which chlamydia was detected. The proportion of samples with chlamydia was greater in the luteal phase (4.8%, 184/3831) than in the follicular phase (3.4%, 233/6816) both in the crude (OR 1.29 95%CI 1.1–1.6, p = 0.01) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.4 (95%CI 1.1–1.8, p = 0.004). Among women using hormonal contraception, there was no significant association with the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (aOR 1.3, 95%CI 0.9, 1.8, p = 0.18). Among women not using hormonal contraception, there was a significant association with the luteal phase (aOR 1.6, (95% CI 1.1–2.3, p = 0.007). The chlamydia load was not significantly different in the 329 positive stored samples in weeks 3 and 4 vs weeks 1 and 2 for any site (P>0.12). Conclusions The higher detection of chlamydia detection in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle in only those not taking hormonal contraception suggest that hormonal factors influence chlamydia detection. The absence of a significantly highly chlamydia load in women during the luteal phase raises questions about the mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2080503328,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and subgenotypes may vary in geographical distribution and virological features. Previous investigations, including ours, showed that HBV genotypes B and C were respectively predominant in South and North China, while genotypes A and D were infrequently detected and genotype G was not found. In this study, a novel A/C/G intergenotype was identified in patients with chronic HBV infection in Guilin, a city in southern China. Initial phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene suggested the HBV recombinant to be genotype G. However, extended genotyping based on the entire HBV genome indicated it to be an A/C/G intergenotype with a closer relation to genotype C. Breakpoint analysis using the SIMPLOT program revealed that the recombinant had a recombination with a arrangement of genotypes A, G, A and C fragments. Compared with the HBV recombinants harboring one or two genotype G fragments found in Asian countries, this Guilin recombinant was highly similar to the Vietnam (98–99%) and Long An recombinants (96–99%), but had a relatively low similarity to the Thailand one (89%). Unlike those with the typical genotype G of HBV, the patients with the Guilin recombinant were seropositive for HBeAg. Moreover, a relatively high HBV DNA viral load (>2×106 IU/ml) was detected in the patients, and the analysis of viral replication capacity showed that the Guilin recombinant strains had a competent replication capacity similar to genotypes B and C strains. These findings can aid in not only the clarification of the phylogenetic origin of the HBV recombinants with the genotype G fragment found in Asian countries, but also the understanding of the virological properties of these complicated HBV recombinants."
https://openalex.org/W1971633949,"This study was undertaken to establish a rabbit esophageal tumor model for mimicking human esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESC) by endoscopic and surgical implantation of VX2 tumors.Fragments of a VX2 tumour were endoscopically implanted in the submucosal layer of the thoracic esophagus of 32 New Zealand white rabbits, while 34 animals received surgical implantation into the muscular layer. Then, the animals were studied endoscopically and pathologically. The safety and efficiency of the two methods and the pathological features of the animal models were analyzed.Both the endoscopic and the surgical method had a relatively high success rate of tumor implantation [93.7% (30/32) vs. 97.1% (33/34)] and tumor growth [86.7% (26/30) vs. 81.8% (27/33)], and the variation in the results was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Compared with those produced by the surgical method, the models produced by the endoscopic method had a higher rate of severe esophageal stricture [61.5% (16/26) vs. 29.6% (8/27)] and of intra-luminal tumor growth [73.1% (19/26) vs. 37.0% (10/27)], and had a lower rate of tumor invasion of adjacent organs [53.8% (14/26) vs. 81.5% (22/27)]; all of these results were statistically significant (P<0.05). However, the difference in the survival time and the rates of tumor regional/distant metastasis [38.5% (10/26) vs. 51.8% (14/27)] between the two methods were not statistically significant (P>0.05).The endoscopic and surgical methods are both safe and effective for establishment of VX2 tumors in the rabbit esophagus. The models produced by the two methods have different pathologic features mimicking that of human ESC. We recommend the models for studies on surgical procedures and minimally invasive treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1990186295,"Schisandra chinensis (Turz Baill) (S. chinensis) (SC) fruit is a hepatoprotective herb containing many lignans and a large amount of polysaccharides. A novel polysaccharide (called SC-2) was isolated from SC of MW 841 kDa, which exhibited a protein-to-polysaccharide ratio of 0.4089, and showed a characteristic FTIR spectrum of a peptidoglycan. Powder X-ray diffraction revealed microcrystalline structures within SC-2. SC-2 contained 10 monosaccharides and 15 amino acids (essential amino acids of 78.12%w/w). In a HepG2 cell model, SC-2 was shown by MTT and TUNEL assay to be completely non-cytotoxic. A kinetic analysis and fluorescence-labeling technique revealed no intracellular disposition of SC-2. Combined treatment of lignans with SC-2 enhanced the intracellular transport of schisandrin B and deoxyschisandrin but decreased that of gomisin C, resulting in alteration of cell-killing bioactivity. The Second Law of Thermodynamics allows this type of unidirectional transport. Conclusively, SC-2 alters the transport and cell killing capability by a “Catcher-Pitcher Unidirectional Transport Mechanism”."
https://openalex.org/W2026613319,"Soil biogeochemical processes and the ecological stability of wetland ecosystems under global warming scenarios have gained increasing attention worldwide. Changes in the capacity of microorganisms to maintain stoichiometric homeostasis, or relatively stable internal concentrations of elements, may serve as an indicator of alterations to soil biogeochemical processes and their associated ecological feedbacks. In this study, an outdoor computerized microcosm was set up to simulate a warmed (+5°C) climate scenario, using novel, minute-scale temperature manipulation technology. The principle of stoichiometric homeostasis was adopted to illustrate phosphorus (P) biogeochemical cycling coupled with carbon (C) dynamics within the soil-microorganism complex. We hypothesized that enhancing the flux of P from soil to water under warming scenarios is tightly coupled with a decrease in homeostatic regulation ability in wetland ecosystems. Results indicate that experimental warming impaired the ability of stoichiometric homeostasis (H) to regulate biogeochemical processes, enhancing the ecological role of wetland soil as an ecological source for both P and C. The potential P flux from soil to water ranged from 0.11 to 34.51 mg m−2 d−1 in the control and 0.07 to 61.26 mg m−2 d−1 in the warmed treatment. The synergistic function of C-P acquisition is an important mechanism underlying C∶P stoichiometric balance for soil microorganisms under warming. For both treatment groups, strongly significant (p<0.001) relationships fitting a negative allometric power model with a fractional exponent were found between n-HC∶P (the specialized homeostatic regulation ability as a ratio of soil highly labile organic carbon to dissolved reactive phosphorus in porewater) and potential P flux. Although many factors may affect soil P dynamics, the n-HC∶P term fundamentally reflects the stoichiometric balance or interactions between the energy landscape (i.e., C) and flow of resources (e.g., N and P), and can be a useful ecological tool for assessing potential P flux in ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2040918531,"HERG K+ channel, the genetic counterpart of rapid delayed rectifier K+ current in cardiac cells, is responsible for many cases of inherited and drug-induced long QT syndromes. HERG has unusual biophysical properties distinct from those of other K+ channels. While the conventional pulse protocols in patch-clamp studies have helped us elucidate these properties, their limitations in assessing HERG function have also been progressively noticed. We employed AP-clamp techniques using physiological action potential waveforms recorded from various regions of canine heart to study HERG function in HEK293 cells and identified several novel aspects of HERG function. We showed that under AP-clamp IHERG increased gradually with membrane repolarization, peaked at potentials around 20–30 mV more negative than revealed by pulse protocols and at action potential duration (APD) to 60%-70% full repolarization, and fell rapidly at the terminal phase of repolarization. We found that the rising phase of IHERG was conferred by removal of inactivation and the decaying phase resulted from a fall in driving force, which were all determined by the rate of membrane repolarization. We identified regional heterogeneity and transmural gradient of IHERG when quantified with the area covered by IHERG trace. In addition, we observed regional and transmural differences of IHERG in response to dofetilide blockade. Finally, we characterized the influence of HERG function by selective inhibition of other ion currents. Based on our results, we conclude that the distinct biophysical properties of HERG reported by AP-clamp confer its unique function in cardiac repolarization thereby in antiarrhythmia and arrhythmogenesis."
