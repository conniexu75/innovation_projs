https://openalex.org/W2062473455,"Many biological processes are regulated through the selective dephosphorylation of proteins. Protein serine-threonine phosphatases are assembled from catalytic subunits bound to diverse regulatory subunits that provide substrate specificity and subcellular localization. We describe a small molecule, guanabenz, that bound to a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1, PPP1R15A/GADD34, selectively disrupting the stress-induced dephosphorylation of the α subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). Without affecting the related PPP1R15B-phosphatase complex and constitutive protein synthesis, guanabenz prolonged eIF2α phosphorylation in human stressed cells, adjusting the protein production rates to levels manageable by available chaperones. This favored protein folding and thereby rescued cells from protein misfolding stress. Thus, regulatory subunits of phosphatases are drug targets, a property used here to restore proteostasis in stressed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2071199204,"Sizing Signals Growth regulation of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc critically depends on the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) morphogen gradient. How a graded Dpp signal is interpreted by cells to control homogeneous tissue growth remains unclear. Wartlick et al. (p. 1154 ; see the Perspective by Le Goff and Lecuit ) address this question by measuring the spatial and temporal changes of Dpp concentration and signaling activity during the disc growth phase and by quantifying cell proliferation parameters in the discs. Both modeling and experimental findings suggest that both Dpp concentration and signaling gradients scale with tissue size so that, on average, the onset of mitosis occurs when Dpp signaling levels have increased by 50% since the beginning of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2010784296,"In 2008, over 300,000 women died during pregnancy or childbirth, mostly in poor countries. While there are proven interventions to make childbirth safer, there is uncertainty about the best way to deliver these at large scale. In particular, there is currently a debate about whether maternal deaths are more likely to be prevented by delivering effective interventions through scaled up facilities or via community-based services. To inform this debate, we examined delivery location and attendance and the reasons women report for giving birth at home.We conducted a secondary analysis of maternal delivery data from Demographic and Health Surveys in 48 developing countries from 2003 to the present. We stratified reported delivery locations by wealth quintile for each country and created weighted regional summaries. For sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where death rates are highest, we conducted a subsample analysis of motivations for giving birth at home. In SSA, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, more than 70% of all births in the lowest two wealth quintiles occurred at home. In SSA, 54.1% of the richest women reported using public facilities compared with only 17.7% of the poorest women. Among home births in SSA, 56% in the poorest quintile were unattended while 41% were attended by a traditional birth attendant (TBA); 40% in the wealthiest quintile were unattended, while 33% were attended by a TBA. Seven per cent of the poorest women reported cost as a reason for not delivering in a facility, while 27% reported lack of access as a reason. The most common reason given by both the poorest and richest women for not delivering in a facility was that it was deemed ""not necessary"" by a household decision maker. Among the poorest women, ""not necessary"" was given as a reason by 68% of women whose births were unattended and by 66% of women whose births were attended.In developing countries, most poor women deliver at home. This suggests that, at least in the near term, efforts to reduce maternal deaths should prioritize community-based interventions aimed at making home births safer."

https://openalex.org/W2015527681,"Dynamic assembly is a powerful fabrication method of complex, functionally diverse molecular architectures, but its use in synthetic nanomachines has been hampered by the difficulty of avoiding reversible attachments that result in the premature breaking apart of loosely held moving parts. We show that molecular motion can be controlled in dynamically assembled systems through segregation of the disassembly process and internal translation to time scales that differ by four orders of magnitude. Helical molecular tapes were designed to slowly wind around rod-like guests and then to rapidly slide along them. The winding process requires helix unfolding and refolding, as well as a strict match between helix length and anchor points on the rods. This modular design and dynamic assembly open up promising capabilities in molecular machinery."

https://openalex.org/W2052883386,"Glioblastoma is one of the most fatal cancers, characterized by a strong vascularized phenotype. YKL-40, a secreted glycoprotein, is overexpressed in patients with glioblastomas and has potential as a novel tumor biomarker. The molecular mechanisms of YKL-40 in glioblastoma development, however, are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role YKL-40 plays in the regulation of VEGF expression, tumor angiogenesis, and radioresistance. YKL-40 up-regulated VEGF expression in glioblastoma cell line U87, and both YKL-40 and VEGF synergistically promote endothelial cell angiogenesis. Interestingly, long term inhibition of VEGF up-regulated YKL-40. YKL-40 induced coordination of membrane receptor syndecan-1 and integrin αvβ5, and triggered a signaling cascade through FAK(397) to ERK-1 and ERK-2, leading to elevated VEGF and enhanced angiogenesis. In addition, γ-irradiation of U87 cells increased YKL-40 expression that protects cell death through AKT activation and also enhances endothelial cell angiogenesis. Blockade of YKL-40 activity or expression decreased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in xenografted animals. Immunohistochemical analysis of human glioblastomas revealed a correlation between YKL-40, VEGF, and patient survival. These findings have shed light on the mechanisms by which YKL-40 promotes tumor angiogenesis and malignancy, and thus provide a therapeutic target for tumor treatment."

We performed cytometric analyses for stemness and differentiation antigens, including CD29, CD34, CD44, CD90, CD117, and CD133, on 21 human primary sarcomas on the day of surgery. From sarcoma biopsies, we obtained 2 chondrosarcoma-stabilized cell lines and 2 osteosarcoma stabilized cell lines, on which sphere formation, side population profile, stemness gene expression, and in vivo and in vitro assays were performed. All samples expressed the CD133, CD44, and CD29 markers. Therefore, we selected a CD133+ subpopulation from stabilized cell lines that displayed the capacity to grow as sarcospheres able to initiate and sustain tumor growth in nonobese diabetic/severe combined (NOD/SCID) mice, to express stemness genes, including OCT3/4, Nanog, Sox2, and Nestin, and to differentiate into mesenchymal lineages, such as osteoblasts and adipocytes. Our findings show the existence of cancer stem cells in human primary bone sarcomas and highlight CD133 as a pivotal marker for identification of these cells. This may be of primary importance in the development of new therapeutic strategies and new prognostic procedures against these highly aggressive and metastatic tumors.—Tirino, V., Desiderio, V., Paino, F., De Rosa, A, Papaccio, F., Fazioli, F., Pirozzi, G., Papaccio, G.

https://openalex.org/W2028987016,"Light-responsive neural activity in central brain neurons is generally conveyed through opsin-based signaling from external photoreceptors. Large lateral ventral arousal neurons (lLNvs) in Drosophila melanogaster increase action potential firing within seconds in response to light in the absence of all opsin-based photoreceptors. Light-evoked changes in membrane resting potential occur in about 100 milliseconds. The light response is selective for blue wavelengths corresponding to the spectral sensitivity of CRYPTOCHROME (CRY). cry-null lines are light-unresponsive, but restored CRY expression in the lLNv rescues responsiveness. Furthermore, expression of CRY in neurons that are normally unresponsive to light confers responsiveness. The CRY-mediated light response requires a flavin redox-based mechanism and depends on potassium channel conductance, but is independent of the classical circadian CRY-TIMELESS interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2026332763,"Memories are more easily disrupted than improved. Many agents can impair memories during encoding and consolidation. In contrast, the armamentarium of potential memory enhancers is so far rather modest. Moreover, the effect of the latter appears to be limited to enhancing new memories during encoding and the initial period of cellular consolidation, which can last from a few minutes to hours after learning. Here, we report that overexpression in the rat neocortex of the protein kinase C isozyme protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ) enhances long-term memory, whereas a dominant negative PKMζ disrupts memory, even long after memory has been formed."
https://openalex.org/W2004739896,"Flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), depend on the host endoplasmic reticulum for translation, replication, and packaging of their genomes. Here we report that DENV-2 infection modulates the unfolded protein response in a time-dependent manner. We show that early DENV-2 infection triggers and then suppresses PERK-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation and that in mid and late DENV-2 infection, the IRE1-XBP1 and ATF6 pathways are activated, respectively. Activation of IRE1-XBP1 correlated with induction of downstream targets GRP78, CHOP, and GADD34. Furthermore, induction of CHOP did not induce apoptotic markers, such as suppression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, activation of caspase-9 or caspase-3, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Finally, we show that DENV-2 replication is affected in PERK(-/-) and IRE1(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts when compared with wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts. These results demonstrate that time-dependent activation of the unfolded protein response by DENV-2 can override inhibition of translation, prevent apoptosis, and prolong the viral life cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2084786467,"Since their arrival in the Tibetan Plateau during the Neolithic Age, Tibetans have been well-adapted to extreme environmental conditions and possess genetic variation that reflect their living environment and migratory history. To investigate the origin of Tibetans and the genetic basis of adaptation in a rigorous environment, we genotyped 30 Tibetan individuals with more than one million SNP markers. Our findings suggested that Tibetans, together with the Yi people, were descendants of Tibeto-Burmans who diverged from ancient settlers of East Asia. The valleys of the Hengduan Mountain range may be a major migration route. We also identified a set of positively-selected genes that belong to functional classes of the embryonic, female gonad, and blood vessel developments, as well as response to hypoxia. Most of these genes were highly correlated with population-specific and beneficial phenotypes, such as high infant survival rate and the absence of chronic mountain sickness."
https://openalex.org/W2050254269,"The type II secretion (T2S) system is responsible for extracellular secretion of a broad range of proteins, including toxins and degradative enzymes that play important roles in the pathogenesis and life cycle of many gram-negative bacteria. In Vibrio cholerae, the etiological agent of cholera, the T2S machinery transports cholera toxin, which induces profuse watery diarrhea, a hallmark of this life-threatening disease. Besides cholera toxin, four other proteins have been shown to be transported by the T2S machinery, including hemagglutinin protease, chitinase, GbpA, and lipase. Here, for the first time, we have applied proteomic approaches, including isotope tagging for relative and absolute quantification coupled with multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, to perform an unbiased and comprehensive analysis of proteins secreted by the T2S apparatus of the V. cholerae El Tor strain N16961 under standard laboratory growth conditions. This analysis identified 16 new putative T2S substrates, including sialidase, several proteins participating in chitin utilization, two aminopeptidases, TagA-related protein, cytolysin, RbmC, three hypothetical proteins encoded by VCA0583, VCA0738, and VC2298, and three serine proteases VesA, VesB, and VesC. Focusing on the initial characterization of VesA, VesB, and VesC, we have confirmed enzymatic activities and T2S-dependent transport for each of these proteases. In addition, analysis of single, double, and triple protease knock-out strains indicated that VesA is the primary protease responsible for processing the A subunit of cholera toxin during in vitro growth of the V. cholerae strain N16961."
https://openalex.org/W1965068472,"Peroxiredoxins (Prx) are thiol peroxidases that exhibit exceptionally high reactivity toward peroxides, but the chemical basis for this is not well understood. We present strong experimental evidence that two highly conserved arginine residues play a vital role in this activity of human Prx2 and Prx3. Point mutation of either ArgI or ArgII (in Prx3 Arg-123 and Arg-146, which are ∼3-4 Å or ∼6-7 Å away from the active site peroxidative cysteine (C(p)), respectively) in each case resulted in a 5 orders of magnitude loss in reactivity. A further 2 orders of magnitude decrease in the second-order rate constant was observed for the double arginine mutants of both isoforms, suggesting a cooperative function for these residues. Detailed ab initio theoretical calculations carried out with the high level G4 procedure suggest strong catalytic effects of H-bond-donating functional groups to the C(p) sulfur and the reactive and leaving oxygens of the peroxide in a cooperative manner. Using a guanidinium cation in the calculations to mimic the functional group of arginine, we were able to locate two transition structures that indicate rate enhancements consistent with our experimentally observed rate constants. Our results provide strong evidence for a vital role of ArgI in activating the peroxide that also involves H-bonding to ArgII. This mechanism could explain the exceptional reactivity of peroxiredoxins toward H(2)O(2) and may have wider implications for protein thiol reactivity toward peroxides."
https://openalex.org/W2007942591,"Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) activity has previously been reported in endothelial cells (ECs). However, the exact isoforms of VGSCs present, their mode(s) of action, and potential role(s) in angiogenesis have not been investigated. The main aims of this study were to determine the role of VGSC activity in angiogenic functions and to elucidate the potentially associated signaling mechanisms using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model system. Real-time PCR showed that the primary functional VGSC α- and β-subunit isoforms in HUVECs were Nav1.5, Nav1.7, VGSCβ1, and VGSCβ3. Western blots verified that VGSCα proteins were expressed in HUVECs, and immunohistochemistry revealed VGSCα expression in mouse aortic ECs in vivo. Electrophysiological recordings showed that the channels were functional and suppressed by tetrodotoxin (TTX). VGSC activity modulated the following angiogenic properties of HUVECs: VEGF-induced proliferation or chemotaxis, tubular differentiation, and substrate adhesion. Interestingly, different aspects of angiogenesis were controlled by the different VGSC isoforms based on TTX sensitivity and effects of siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Additionally, we show for the first time that TTX-resistant (TTX-R) VGSCs (Nav1.5) potentiate VEGF-induced ERK1/2 activation through the PKCα-B-RAF signaling axis. We postulate that this potentiation occurs through modulation of VEGF-induced HUVEC depolarization and [Ca(2+)](i). We conclude that VGSCs regulate multiple angiogenic functions and VEGF signaling in HUVECs. Our results imply that targeting VGSC expression/activity could be a novel strategy for controlling angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056124534,"Innate cellular immunity is the immediate host response against pathogens, and activation of innate immunity also modulates the induction of adaptive immunity. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) are a family of intracellular receptors that recognize conserved patterns associated with intracellular pathogens, but information about their role in the host defense against DNA viruses is limited. Here we report that varicella-zoster virus (VZV), an alphaherpesvirus that is the causative agent of varicella and herpes zoster, induces formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the associated processing of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β by activated caspase-1 in infected cells. NLRP3 inflammasome formation was induced in VZV-infected human THP-1 cells, which are a transformed monocyte cell line, primary lung fibroblasts, and melanoma cells. Absent in melanoma gene-2 (AIM2) is an interferon-inducible protein that can form an alternative inflammasome complex with caspase-1 in virus-infected cells. Experiments in VZV-infected melanoma cells showed that NLRP3 protein recruits the adaptor protein ASC and caspase-1 to form an NLRP3 inflammasome complex independent of AIM2 protein and in the absence of free radical reactive oxygen species release. NLRP3 was also expressed extensively in infected skin xenografts in the severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model of VZV pathogenesis in vivo. We conclude that NLRP3 inflammasome formation is an innate cellular response to infection with this common pathogenic human herpesvirus."

On store depletion, the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1 activates Orai1, the pore-forming unit of Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. Here, we show that Orai1 is regulated by serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1), a growth factor-regulated kinase. Membrane Orai1 protein abundance, /CRAC, and SOCE in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably expressing Orai1 and transfected with STIM1 were each significantly enhanced by coexpression of constitutively active SGK1 (by+81, +378, and+136%, respectively) but not by inactive K12 NSGK1. Coexpression of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, an established negatively regulated SGK1 target, down-regulated SOCE (by –48%) and /CRAc (by –60%), an effect reversed by expression of SGK1 (by +175 and +173%, respectively). Orai1 protein abundance and SOCE were significantly lower in mast cells from SGK1-knockout (sgk1) mice (by –37% and –52%, respectively) than in mast cells from wild-type (sgk1+/+) littermates. Activation of SOCE by sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase-inhibitor thapsi-gargin (2 μΜ) stimulated migration, an effect significantly higher (by +306%) in SGKl-expressing than in SGKl-expressing HEK293 cells, and also significantly higher (by +108%) in sgk1+/+ than in sgk1−/− mast cells. SGK1 is thus a novel key player in the regulation of SOCE.—Eylenstein, A., Geh-ring, E.-M., Heise, N., Shumilina, E., Schmidt, S., Szteyn, K., Münzer, P., Nurbaeva, M.

https://openalex.org/W2034182181,"Background Viral RNA translation and replication are regulated by sequence and structural elements in the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR) and by host cell and/or viral proteins that bind them. Dengue virus has a single-stranded RNA genome with positive polarity, a 5′ m7GpppG cap, and a conserved 3′-terminal stem loop (SL) that is linked to proposed functions in viral RNA transcription and translation. Mechanisms explaining the contributions of host proteins to viral RNA translation and replication are poorly defined, yet understanding host protein-viral RNA interactions may identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. This study was directed at identifying functionally significant host proteins that bind the conserved dengue virus RNA 3′ terminus. Methodology/Principal Findings Proteins eluted from a dengue 3′ SL RNA affinity column at increasing ionic strength included two with double-strand RNA binding motifs (NF90/DRBP76 and DEAH box polypeptide 9/RNA helicase A (RHA)), in addition to NF45, which forms a heterodimer with NF90. Although detectable NF90 and RHA proteins localized to the nucleus of uninfected cells, immunofluorescence revealed cytoplasmic NF90 in dengue virus-infected cells, leading us to hypothesize that NF90 has a functional role(s) in dengue infections. Cells depleted of NF90 were used to quantify viral RNA transcript levels and production of infectious dengue virus. NF90 depletion was accompanied by a 50%-70% decrease in dengue RNA levels and in production of infectious viral progeny. Conclusions/Significance The results indicate that NF90 interacts with the 3′ SL structure of the dengue RNA and is a positive regulator of dengue virus replication. NF90 depletion diminished the production of infectious dengue virus by more than 50%, which may have important significance for identifying therapeutic targets to limit a virus that threatens more than a billion people worldwide."

The variations are systematic; the relative abundance of (16)O first decreases toward the CAI margin, approaching a planetary-like isotopic composition, then shifts to extremely (16)O-rich compositions through the surrounding rim. The variability implies that CAIs probably formed from several oxygen reservoirs. The observations support early and short-lived fluctuations of the environment in which CAIs formed, either because of transport of the CAIs themselves to distinct regions of the solar nebula or because of varying gas composition near the proto-Sun."
https://openalex.org/W2133726081,"Cryptococcus gattii is a basidiomycetous yeast that causes life-threatening disease in humans and animals. Within C. gattii, four molecular types are recognized (VGI to VGIV). The Australian VGII population has been in the spotlight since 2005, when it was suggested as the possible origin for the ongoing outbreak at Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada), with same-sex mating being suggested as the driving force behind the emergence of this outbreak, and is nowadays hypothesized as a widespread phenomenon in C. gattii. However, an in-depth characterization of the Australian VGII population is still lacking. The present work aimed to define the genetic variability within the Australian VGII population and determine processes shaping its population structure.A total of 54 clinical, veterinary and environmental VGII isolates from different parts of the Australian continent were studied. To place the Australian population in a global context, 17 isolates from North America, Europe, Asia and South America were included. Genetic variability was assessed using the newly adopted international consensus multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme, including seven genetic loci: CAP59, GPD1, LAC1, PLB1, SOD1, URA5 and IGS1. Despite the overall clonality observed, the presence of MATa VGII isolates in Australia was demonstrated for the first time in association with recombination in MATα-MATa populations. Our results also support the hypothesis of a ""smouldering"" outbreak throughout the Australian continent, involving a limited number of VGII genotypes, which is possibly caused by a founder effect followed by a clonal expansion.The detection of sexual recombination in MATα-MATa population in Australia is in accordance with the natural life cycle of C. gattii involving opposite mating types and presents an alternative to the same-sex mating strategy suggested elsewhere. The potential for an Australian wide outbreak highlights the crucial issue to develop active surveillance procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2093436239,"Erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium merozoites is a complex, multistep process that is mediated by a number of parasite ligand-erythrocyte receptor interactions. One such family of parasite ligands includes the P. falciparum reticulocyte binding homologue (PfRH) proteins that are homologous with the P. vivax reticulocyte binding proteins and have been shown to play a role in erythrocyte invasion. There are five functional PfRH proteins of which only PfRH2a/2b have not yet been demonstrated to bind erythrocytes. In this study, we demonstrated that native PfRH2a/2b is processed near the N-terminus yielding fragments of 220 kDa and 80 kDa that exhibit differential erythrocyte binding specificities. The erythrocyte binding specificity of the 220 kDa processed fragment of native PfRH2a/2b was sialic acid-independent, trypsin resistant and chymotrypsin sensitive. This specific binding phenotype is consistent with previous studies that disrupted the PfRH2a/2b genes and demonstrated that PfRH2b is involved in a sialic acid independent, trypsin resistant, chymotrypsin sensitive invasion pathway. Interestingly, we found that the smaller 80 kDa PfRH2a/2b fragment is processed from the larger 220 kDa fragment and binds erythrocytes in a sialic acid dependent, trypsin resistant and chymotrypsin sensitive manner. Thus, the two processed fragments of PfRH2a/2b differed with respect to their dependence on sialic acids for erythrocyte binding. Further, we mapped the erythrocyte binding domain of PfRH2a/2b to a conserved 40 kDa N-terminal region (rPfRH240) in the ectodomain that is common to both PfRH2a and PfRH2b. We demonstrated that recombinant rPfRH240 bound human erythrocytes with the same specificity as the native 220 kDa processed protein. Moreover, antibodies generated against rPfRH240 blocked erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum through a sialic acid independent pathway. PfRH2a/2b thus plays a key role in erythrocyte invasion and its conserved receptor-binding domain deserves attention as a promising candidate for inclusion in a blood-stage malaria vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2100584710,"In 1948, a small colony of emperor penguins Aptenodytes forsteri was discovered breeding on Emperor Island (67° 51′ 52″ S, 68° 42′ 20″ W), in the Dion Islands, close to the West Antarctic Peninsula (Stonehouse 1952). When discovered, the colony comprised approximately 150 breeding pairs; these numbers were maintained until 1970, after which time the colony showed a continuous decline. By 1999 there were fewer than 20 pairs, and in 2009 high-resolution aerial photography revealed no remaining trace of the colony. Here we relate the decline and loss of the Emperor Island colony to a well-documented rise in local mean annual air temperature and coincident decline in seasonal sea ice duration. The loss of this colony provides empirical support for recent studies (Barbraud & Weimerskirch 2001; Jenouvrier et al 2005, 2009; Ainley et al 2010; Barber-Meyer et al 2005) that have highlighted the vulnerability of emperor penguins to changes in sea ice duration and distribution. These studies suggest that continued climate change is likely to impact upon future breeding success and colony viability for this species. Furthermore, a recent circumpolar study by Fretwell & Trathan (2009) highlighted those Antarctic coastal regions where colonies appear most vulnerable to such changes. Here we examine which other colonies might be at risk, discussing various ecological factors, some previously unexplored, that may also contribute to future declines. The implications of this are important for future modelling work and for understanding which colonies actually are most vulnerable."
https://openalex.org/W2029105864,"There is evidence that alterations in the normal physiological activity of PrPC contribute to prion-induced neurotoxicity. This mechanism has been difficult to investigate, however, because the normal function of PrPC has remained obscure, and there are no assays available to measure it. We recently reported that cells expressing PrP deleted for residues 105–125 exhibit spontaneous ionic currents and hypersensitivity to certain classes of cationic drugs. Here, we utilize cell culture assays based on these two phenomena to test how changes in PrP sequence and/or cellular localization affect the functional activity of the protein. We report that the toxic activity of Δ105–125 PrP requires localization to the plasma membrane and depends on the presence of a polybasic amino acid segment at the N terminus of PrP. Several different deletions spanning the central region as well as three disease-associated point mutations also confer toxic activity on PrP.

Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies comprise a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders in humans and animals that can be sporadic, infectious, or genetic in origin (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5052) Google Scholar, 2.Prusiner, S. B., (ed) (2004) Prion Biology and Diseases, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.Google Scholar). The prion protein (PrPC) is a membrane-anchored glycoprotein with no widely agreed-upon physiological function, although its ability to convert into a self-propagating isoform (PrPSc) is associated with development of prion diseases. PrPC, thus, plays a crucial role in prion pathogenesis as a substrate for generation of PrPSc, a conclusion that has been demonstrated by the resistance of PrP-null mice to prion infection (3Büeler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). In addition, however, there is evidence that PrPC is required for delivery of a toxic signal during prion propagation. This is demonstrated by the fact that brain tissue from PrP-null mice grafted into wild-type animals remains healthy despite the presence of copious amounts of PrPSc from the surrounding host brain (4Brandner S.

Therefore, prion neurotoxicity is likely due to subversion of normal PrPC function rather than loss of PrPC or gain of PrPSc activity (6Harris D.A. True H.L.

However, progress in investigating this mechanism has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the physiological role of PrPC and the absence of assays to measure the functional activity of the protein. To address this issue, our laboratory has recently developed two assays that measure toxicity of PrP mutants expressed in cultured cells. The first assay is a drug-based cellular assay (DBCA) 3The abbreviations used are: DBCA, drug-based cellular assay; M6PR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GSS, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CR, central region. that measures cell death resulting from increased accumulation of two classes of drugs that are normally used to select transfected cell lines (aminoglycosides and bleomycin analogues) (7Massignan T. Stewart R.S. Biasini E. Solomon I.H. Bonetto V. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7752-7765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Massignan T. Biasini E. Harris D.A. Methods. 2011; 53: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The second assay utilizes whole-cell patch clamping to measure the large spontaneous cationic currents associated with mutant PrP expression (9Solomon I.H. Huettner J.E. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26719-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that these currents are generated by PrP-containing ion channels or pores in the plasma membrane that may facilitate the increased influx of drugs into cells observed in the DBCA. These two assays, which measure functional activities of PrPC, provide powerful tools for identifying structural domains and cellular compartments that are essential for PrP toxicity, information that could otherwise be obtained only by the creation and characterization of multiple transgenic mouse lines. In both the DBCA and patch clamp assay, the largest effects are observed for Δ105–125 PrP (referred to as ΔCR PrP), a deletion mutant that is missing 21 highly conserved residues in the central region of the protein. Transgenic mice expressing this molecule develop severe neurological illness that can be rescued by overexpressing wild-type PrP (10Li A. Christensen H.M. Stewart L.R. Roth K.A. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). ΔCR PrP is neither aggregated nor protease-resistant and has cellular localization identical to that of WT PrP, suggesting that its toxicity is due to an alteration of the normal function of PrPC (10Li A. Christensen H.M. Stewart L.R. Roth K.A. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Christensen H.M. Harris D.A. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have selected ΔCR PrP as a starting point in our analysis of the structural and cellular determinants of PrP toxicity. Importantly, several of the sequence domains identified in our study as being essential for PrP toxicity have been previously reported to be critical for PrPSc formation, suggesting that common structural features may govern both the functional activity of PrPC and its conversion to PrPSc. Therefore, small molecules capable of blocking mutant PrP toxicity in our cellular assays may be valuable as anti-prion therapeutics. HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were maintained in α-minimum essential medium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml hygromycin. Stable lines were created by transfecting HEK cells with pcDNA3.1(+)Hygro (Invitrogen) vector alone or with vector containing the cDNA sequence for WT or mutant murine PrP using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Clones were selected for 14 days in 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Except where noted (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9), WT PrP contained an epitope tag (L108M/V111M) for the monoclonal antibody 3F4 (12Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M. Kascsak R.J. Bendheim P.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletions and point mutations were introduced into WT PrP using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequences for Δ105–125 (ΔCR) PrP and PG14 have been described previously (10Li A. Christensen H.M. Stewart L.R. Roth K.A. Chiesa R. Harris D.A.

The chimeric transmembrane PrP construct ΔCR PrP-mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) was generated by ligating cDNA encoding amino acids 1–230 of mouse PrP to the transmembrane and truncated cytoplasmic domains of a mutant bovine cation-independent M6PR, as described previously (14Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The ER retention signal KKMP was introduced at the C terminus of the ΔCR PrP-M6PR construct using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. ΔCR PrP-Golgi was constructed by ligating cDNA encoding amino acids 1–230 of mouse PrP to the transmembrane domain of rubella virus envelope glycoprotein E2 (amino acids 238–255) (15Hobman T.C.

Some of the samples in Fig. 5D were deglycosylated by treatment with either N-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Immunofluorescence staining was performed by fixing cells in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilizing with Triton X-100 in PBS, and labeling with 6D11 and Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Antibodies against giantin (Covance) and protein disulfide isomerase (Sigma) were used to label the Golgi and ER, respectively, followed by Alexa-594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). For surface staining, living cells were incubated on ice with 6D11, after which they were fixed and labeled with Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG. Cells were viewed with 40× or 100× objectives on a Nikon TE-2000E inverted fluorescence microscope, and images were captured with METAMORPH software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Assay of spontaneous channel activity was performed by whole-cell patch clamping using standard techniques as previously described (9Solomon I.H. Huettner J.E. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26719-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Huettner J.E. Lu A. Qu Y. Wu Y. Kim M. McDonald J.W.

Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass, coated with Sylgard, and polished to an open resistance of 1–10 megaohms. Experiments were conducted at room temperature with the following solutions: internal: 140 mm cesium glucuronate, 5 mm CsCl, 4 mm MgATP, 1 mm Na2GTP, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH); external: 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Current signals were collected from an Axopatch 200B amplifier and digitized with a Digidata 1330 interface (Axon Instruments) or with an EPC-10 amplifier controlled by PatchMaster acquisition software (HEKA Elektronik) and were saved to disc for analysis with PClamp 9 software. Current activity was plotted as the proportion of total recording time that a cell exhibited inward current ≥450 pA. Cell death in response to G418 treatment was assayed as previously described (7Massignan T. Stewart R.S. Biasini E. Solomon I.H. Bonetto V. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7752-7765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 8Massignan T. Biasini E. Harris D.A. Methods. 2011; 53: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Confluent cells in 24-well plates were incubated in medium lacking hygromycin with either 0 or 400 μg/ml G418 for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and cells were incubated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (1 mg/ml in PBS) for 30 min at 37 °C. The MTT was then removed, cells were solubilized in 200 μl of DMSO, and A570 was measured in a plate reader (Bio-Rad). Cell death was calculated by subtracting the percentage of treated to untreated A570 values from 100%. Detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains were isolated as previously described (20Fivaz M. Vilbois F. Thurnheer S. Pasquali C. Abrami L. Bickel P.E. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3989-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in cold buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 30 min on ice. Lysates were mixed with 60% Opti-Prep (Sigma) to reach a final concentration of 40% Opti-Prep. A step gradient was created by overlaying the lysates with 30 and 0% Opti-Prep. Samples were ultracentrifuged at 172,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 300 μl were collected, and protein was methanol-precipitated before Western blotting with 6D11 and anti-flotillin-1 antibodies (BD Biosciences). Measurement of cell surface protein was performed by cell blotting as previously described (21Biasini E. Tapella L. Restelli E. Pozzoli M. Massignan T. Chiesa R. Biochem. J. 2010; 430: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluence on glass coverslips were washed with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and then incubated on ice for 20 min with 6D11 (1:500 in Opti-MEM). Coverslips were then removed and placed face up on chromatography paper (Whatman No. 3MM) soaked in blotting buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet-P40 in PBS). Nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) soaked in blotting buffer were placed on top of the coverslips, dry chromatography paper was placed on top of the membranes, and the sandwich was pressed together for 2 h. Membranes were probed with goat anti-mouse IgG to detect surface PrP or 6D11 followed by goat anti-mouse IgG to detect total PrP. Signals were revealed with ImmobilonTM Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and visualized with a Bio-Rad XRS image scanner. Quantitative densitometry was done using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). To assay protein aggregation by detergent insolubility, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet-P40 in PBS) containing protease (cOmplete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase (PhosSTOP, Roche Applied Science) inhibitor cocktails and incubated on ice for 20 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 × g to remove cell debris. Samples containing 1000 μg of protein in 500 μl were ultracentrifuged at 172,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Insoluble proteins from the pellet and soluble proteins methanol-precipitated from the supernatant were resuspended in equal volumes of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. In this study we modified the sequence of ΔCR PrP to remove several functionally important domains and to target the protein to specific cellular locations. We also introduced additional deletion and point mutations into the central region. The constructs analyzed are summarized in Fig. 1. Each molecule was expressed in clones of stably transfected HEK cells, and its expression level and cellular localization were determined. We then tested the activity of each construct using the DBCA and whole-cell patch clamping. The DBCA measures the susceptibility of the cells to killing by the aminoglycoside antibiotic, G418, which is greatly enhanced by expression of ΔCR PrP (7Massignan T. Stewart R.S. Biasini E. Solomon I.H. Bonetto V. Chiesa R. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7752-7765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were treated for 24 h with G418 and then assayed for cell viability by MTT reduction. For whole-cell patch clamping, cells were held for approximately 10 min at a potential of −80 mV, and the percentage of time during which spontaneous currents exceeded 450 pA was determined. Under these conditions, ΔCR PrP induces large fluctuating inward currents in transfected cells (9Solomon I.H. Huettner J.E. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26719-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For each of the constructs, three independent HEK cell clones were analyzed with similar results, and data for one set of representative clones are shown here. Although the structure of the flexible, N-terminal half of PrPC (amino acids 23–123) lacks observable secondary structure by NMR and x-ray crystallography (22Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wüthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 23Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), it does contain several regions of known biological function. Residues 23–31 have been implicated in endocytosis of PrP via clathrin-coated pits, binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and protein transduction across lipid bilayers (24Shyng S.L. Moulder K.L.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Amino acids 51–90 encompass five octapeptide repeats that bind copper ions and are necessary for copper-induced endocytosis (28Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 207: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 29Pauly P.C. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33107-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). To determine whether these two N-terminal domains are involved in ΔCR PrP toxicity, we deleted residues 23–31 or 51–90 to obtain ΔCR/Δ23–31 and ΔCR/Δ51–90 PrP (Fig. 1). By Western blotting, ΔCR/Δ23–31 and ΔCR/Δ51–90 PrP showed glycosylation patterns similar to those of WT and ΔCR PrP. Both proteins migrated as three bands corresponding to di-, mono-, and unglycosylated molecules, although the molecular sizes of each of the glycoforms was smaller as a result of the additional deletions (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–5). In all the clones examined ΔCR/Δ23–31 PrP had higher levels of expression than WT PrP, most likely due to decreased endocytosis and degradation (27Sunyach C. Jen A. Deng J. Fitzgerald K.T. Frobert Y. Grassi J. McCaffrey M.W. Morris R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining showed similar surface localization patterns for ΔCR/Δ23–31, ΔCR/Δ51–90, WT, and ΔCR PrP (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3The N-terminal polybasic domain, but not the octapeptide repeats, is necessary for ΔCR toxicity.

In contrast, no significant increase in cell death or induction of spontaneous currents was detected in ΔCR/Δ23–31 PrP-expressing cells compared with those expressing WT PrP. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the N-terminal polybasic domain, but not the octapeptide repeats, is necessary for the toxicity of ΔCR PrP. PrPC associates with the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and most molecules are localized to lipid rafts (defined biochemically as detergent-resistant membranes) (30Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 31Naslavsky N. Stein R. Yanai A. Friedlander G. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6324-6331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To determine whether membrane attachment is necessary for ΔCR PrP toxicity, we deleted the GPI attachment signal (amino acids 231–254) to obtain ΔCR/GPI(−) PrP (Fig. 1). Most of this construct was secreted into the medium in a predominantly unglycosylated form, as detected by Western blotting of proteins collected from the medium by methanol precipitation (Fig. 4B), similar to what was observed by Chesebro et al. (32Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In contrast, very little of the protein remained cell-associated, as detected by Western blotting of the cell lysates (Fig. 2A, lane 6) or by cell surface immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 4A). Analyses by DBCA and whole-cell patch clamping of cells expressing ΔCR/GPI(−) PrP revealed levels of cell death and spontaneous inward currents similar to those of WT PrP expressing cells and significantly lower than those of ΔCR PrP-expressing cells (Figs. 4D–F). To test whether the type of membrane attachment is important, we replaced the endogenous GPI anchor attachment signal with the transmembrane domain of the M6PR to obtain ΔCR/M6PR and WT/M6PR PrP (Fig. 1) (14Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These molecules were glycosylated (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8) and localized to the cell surface (Fig. 4A). To determine whether localization to lipid rafts was affected by replacement of the GPI anchor with a transmembrane domain, we fractionated cell extracts on an Opti-Prep density gradient (Fig. 4C). In contrast to ΔCR PrP, which co-fractionated with the DRM resident protein flotilin-1 at the 0–30% interface, ΔCR/M6PR PrP remained at the bottom of the gradient with the densest fractions. This result demonstrates that, as expected, ΔCR/M6PR PrP does not localize to lipid rafts like ΔCR PrP. Cells expressing ΔCR/M6PR PrP, but not WT/M6PR PrP, displayed drug hypersensitivity and spontaneous currents that were similar to those of ΔCR PrP-expressing cells and significantly higher than those of WT PrP-expressing cells (Fig. 4, D–F). Taken together, these results indicate that membrane attachment, but not lipid raft localization, is required for ΔCR PrP toxicity. However, either transmembrane or GPI anchoring is sufficient for activity. We next wanted to determine whether ΔCR PrP toxicity requires residence on the cell surface or whether molecules targeted to intracellular compartments can also be toxic. To restrict expression to the ER, the retention motif KKMP was added to the C terminus of ΔCR/M6PR to obtain ΔCR-ER PrP (33Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To localize expression to the Golgi, the GPI signal was replaced by a transmembrane domain from the rubella virus envelope glycoprotein E2 to obtain ΔCR-Golgi PrP (15Hobman T.C. Woodward L. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). To verify the predicted localization patterns of these constructs, we performed immunofluorescence staining and tested maturation of N-linked oligosaccharide chains by glycosidase digestion. As expected, neither ΔCR-ER nor ΔCR-Golgi PrP was present on the cell surface (Fig. 5A). Immunofluorescence staining of permeabilized cells revealed co-localization of ΔCR-ER PrP with the ER marker protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (Fig. 5B). ΔCR-Golgi PrP, in contrast, co-localized with the Golgi marker giantin in a discrete spot near the nucleus. Western blots of endoglycosidase H-treated cell lysates revealed a shift in migration for both ΔCR-ER and ΔCR-Golgi PrP. In contrast, WT, ΔCR, and ΔCR/M6PR PrP were completely insensitive to digestion (Fig. 5D). Some glycosylated ΔCR-ER and ΔCR-Golgi remained after endoglycosidase H treatment, suggesting either incomplete cleavage or trafficking of a fraction of the molecules beyond the mid-Golgi. However, both molecules migrated faster than fully mature WT PrP before digestion, consistent with incomplete oligosaccharide maturation. Taken together, these data indicate that ΔCR-ER and ΔCR-Golgi PrP are localized to the predicted intracellular compartments. Although the level of ΔCR-ER PrP expression is slightly lower than that of WT PrP, ΔCR-Golgi is expressed at much lower levels by Western blotting (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10). Based on immunofluorescence staining, however, the amount of ΔCR-Golgi localized to the Golgi is similar to that for WT and ΔCR PrP (data not shown). ΔCR-ER and ΔCR-Golgi PrP failed to induce significantly higher levels of cell death or spontaneous current than WT PrP (Fig. 5, E–G). Because ΔCR-ER and ΔCR-Golgi PrP (as well as WT-Cyto and ΔCR-Cyto PrP; see below) were expressed at significantly lower levels than WT and ΔCR PrP, we also examined the toxicity of a ΔCR PrP clone with an expression level similar to that of ΔCR-Golgi, our lowest expressing construct (supplemental Fig. S1A). We found that th"

However, the biological potential of iPS-derived cells and their similarities to cells differentiated from human embryonic stem (hES) cells remain unclear. We derived fibroblast-like cells from two hiPS cell lines and show that their phenotypic properties and patterns of DNA methylation were similar to that of mature fibroblasts and to fibroblasts derived from hES cells. iPS-derived fibroblasts (iPDK) and their hES-derived counterparts (EDK) showed similar cell morphology throughout differentiation, and patterns of gene expression and cell surface markers were characteristic of mature fibroblasts. Array-based methylation analysis was performed for EDK, iPDK and their parental hES and iPS cell lines, and hierarchical clustering revealed that EDK and iPDK had closely-related methylation profiles. DNA methylation analysis of promoter regions associated with extracellular matrix (ECM)-production (COL1A1) by iPS- and hESC-derived fibroblasts and fibroblast lineage commitment (PDGFRβ), revealed promoter demethylation linked to their expression, and patterns of transcription and methylation of genes related to the functional properties of mature stromal cells were seen in both hiPS- and hES-derived fibroblasts. iPDK cells also showed functional properties analogous to those of hES-derived and mature fibroblasts, as seen by their capacity to direct the morphogenesis of engineered human skin equivalents. Characterization of the functional behavior of ES- and iPS-derived fibroblasts in engineered 3D tissues demonstrates the utility of this tissue platform to predict the capacity of iPS-derived cells before their therapeutic application."
https://openalex.org/W2004566372,"Our ability to process visual information is fundamentally limited. This leads to competition between sensory information that is relevant for top-down goals and sensory information that is perceptually salient, but task-irrelevant. The aim of the present study was to identify, from EEG recordings, pre-stimulus and pre-saccadic neural activity that could predict whether top-down or bottom-up processes would win the competition for attention on a trial-by-trial basis. We employed a visual search paradigm in which a lateralized low contrast target appeared alone, or with a low (i.e., non-salient) or high contrast (i.e., salient) distractor. Trials with a salient distractor were of primary interest due to the strong competition between top-down knowledge and bottom-up attentional capture. Our results demonstrated that 1) in the 1-sec pre-stimulus interval, frontal alpha (8-12 Hz) activity was higher on trials where the salient distractor captured attention and the first saccade (bottom-up win); and 2) there was a transient pre-saccadic increase in posterior-parietal alpha (7-8 Hz) activity on trials where the first saccade went to the target (top-down win). We propose that the high frontal alpha reflects a disengagement of attentional control whereas the transient posterior alpha time-locked to the saccade indicates sensory inhibition of the salient distractor and suppression of bottom-up oculomotor capture."
https://openalex.org/W2076051875,"The propensity to develop an anxiety disorder is thought to be determined by genetic and environmental factors. Here we investigated the relationship between a genetic predisposition to trait anxiety and experience-based learned fear in a psychopathological mouse model. Male CD-1 mice selectively bred for either high (HAB), or normal (NAB) anxiety-related behaviour on the elevated plus maze were subjected to classical fear conditioning. During conditioning both mouse lines showed increased fear responses as assessed by freezing behaviour. However, 24 h later, HAB mice displayed more pronounced conditioned responses to both a contextual or cued stimulus when compared with NAB mice. Interestingly, 6 h and already 1 h after fear conditioning, freezing levels were high in HAB mice but not in NAB mice. These results suggest that trait anxiety determines stronger fear memory and/or a weaker ability to inhibit fear responses in the HAB line. The enhanced fear response of HAB mice was attenuated by treatment with either the α2,3,5-subunit selective benzodiazepine partial agonist L-838,417, corticosterone or the selective neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist L-822,429. Overall, the HAB mouse line may represent an interesting model (i) for identifying biological factors underlying misguided conditioned fear responses and (ii) for studying novel anxiolytic pharmacotherapies for patients with fear-associated disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and phobias."
https://openalex.org/W2063176562,"Serotonin exerts a powerful influence on neuronal excitability. In this study, we investigated the effects of serotonin on different neuronal populations in prefrontal cortex (PFC), a major area controlling emotion and cognition. Using whole-cell recordings in PFC slices, we found that bath application of 5-HT dose-dependently increased the firing of FS (fast spiking) interneurons, and decreased the firing of pyramidal neurons. The enhancing effect of 5-HT in FS interneurons was mediated by 5-HT2 receptors, while the reducing effect of 5-HT in pyramidal neurons was mediated by 5-HT1 receptors. Fluoxetine, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, also induced a concentration-dependent increase in the excitability of FS interneurons, but had little effect on pyramidal neurons. In rats with chronic fluoxetine treatment, the excitability of FS interneurons was significantly increased, while pyramidal neurons remained unchanged. Fluoxetine injection largely occluded the enhancing effect of 5-HT in FS interneurons, but did not alter the reducing effect of 5-HT in pyramidal neurons. These data suggest that the excitability of PFC interneurons and pyramidal neurons is regulated by exogenous 5-HT in an opposing manner, and FS interneurons are the major target of Fluoxetine. It provides a framework for understanding the action of 5-HT and antidepressants in altering PFC network activity."
https://openalex.org/W2149454237,"The cell cycle of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, does not easily lend itself to analysis by flow cytometry, mainly because cells in G1 and G2 phase contain the same amount of DNA. This occurs because fission yeast cells under standard growth conditions do not complete cytokinesis until after G1 phase. We have devised a flow cytometric method exploiting the fact that cells in G1 phase contain two nuclei, whereas cells in G2 are mononuclear. Measurements of the width as well as the total area of the DNA-associated fluorescence signal allows the discrimination between cells in G1 and in G2 phase and the cell-cycle progression of fission yeast can be followed in detail by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we show how this method can be used to monitor the timing of cell entry into anaphase. Fission yeast cells tend to form multimers, which represents another problem of flow cytometry-based cell-cycle analysis. Here we present a method employing light-scatter measurements to enable the exclusion of cell doublets, thereby further improving the analysis of fission yeast cells by flow cytometry."
https://openalex.org/W2125030995,"Complement component C5a and ATP are potent effectors of microglial movement and are increased in diverse neurodegenerative diseases and at sites of injury. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) influences microglial function, and different human apoE iso-forms confer variable risk for development of neurodegenerative disorders, especially Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that mouse apoE and human apoE isoforms influence microglial migration. Using primary wild-type and apoE-deficient microglia, we show that C5a- and ATP-stimulated chemotaxis are largely apoE-dependent processes with different molecular bases. Although the C5a-dependent chemotaxis of wild-type microglia was completely blocked by receptor-associated protein (RAP), suggesting apoE receptor involvement, ATP-stimu-lated migration was unaffected by RAP but was associated with differential ERK phosphorylation. Studies using primary microglia derived from targeted replacement mice “humanized” for the coding exons (protein isoform) of human ε2 (apoE2), ε3 (apoE3), or ε4 (apoE4) allele of APOE revealed that primary mouse microglia expressing apoE4 or apoE2 exhibited significantly reduced C5a- and ATP-stimu-lated migration compared with microglia expressing human apoE3. This study, for the first time, demonstrates apoE dependence and apoE isoform-specific modulation of microglial migration in response to distinct chemotactic stimuli commonly associated with neurodegenerative disease.—Cudaback, E., Li, X., Montine, K.

We show that it specifically labels cell surfaces of neural stem and progenitor cells. When 5750-expressing cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from embryonic mouse brains, the sorted population showed increased neurosphere forming capacity and multipotency. Neurospheres generated from 5750-positive cells could self-renew and remained multipotent even after prolonged passaging. Carbohydrate binding assays revealed that the 5750 antibody specifically binds to LewisX-related carbohydrates. Interestingly, we found that the LewisX epitope recognized by clone 5750 differs from those detected by other anti-LewisX antibody clones like 487LeX, SSEA-1LeX, and MMALeX. Our data further reveal that individual anti-LewisX clones can be successfully used to label and deplete different subpopulations of neural cells in vivo and in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W1993455758,"Nuclear proteins typically contain short stretches of basic amino acids (nuclear localization sequences; NLSs) that bind karyopherin α family members, directing nuclear import. Here, we identify CTNNBL1 (catenin-β-like 1), an armadillo motif-containing nuclear protein that exhibits no detectable primary sequence homology to karyopherin α, as a novel, selective NLS-binding protein. CTNNBL1 (a single-copy gene conserved from fission yeast to man) was previously found associated with Prp19-containing RNA-splicing complexes as well as with the antibody-diversifying enzyme AID. We find that CTNNBL1 association with the Prp19 complex is mediated by recognition of the NLS of the CDC5L component of the complex and show that CTNNBL1 also interacts with Prp31 (another U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP-associated splicing factor) through its NLS. As with karyopherin αs, CTNNBL1 binds NLSs via its armadillo (ARM) domain, but displays a separate, more selective NLS binding specificity. Furthermore, the CTNNBL1/AID interaction depends on amino acids forming the AID conformational NLS with CTNNBL1-deficient cells showing a partial defect in AID nuclear accumulation. However, in further contrast to karyopherin αs, the CTNNBL1 N-terminal region itself binds karyopherin αs (rather than karyopherin β), suggesting a function divergent from canonical nuclear transport. Thus, CTNNBL1 is a novel NLS-binding protein, distinct from karyopherin αs, with the results suggesting a possible role in the selective intranuclear targeting or interactions of some splicing-associated complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2016070788,"As playing important roles in gene regulation, microRNAs (miRNAs) are believed as indispensable involvers in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI) that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Working on a hypothesis that modulation of only some key members in the miRNA superfamily could benefit ischemic heart, we proposed a microarray based network biology approach to identify them with the recognized clinical effect of propranolol as a prompt.A long-term MI model of rat was established in this study. The microarray technology was applied to determine the global miRNA expression change intervened by propranolol. Multiple network analyses were sequentially applied to evaluate the regulatory capacity, efficiency and emphasis of the miRNAs which dysexpression in MI were significantly reversed by propranolol.Microarray data analysis indicated that long-term propranolol administration caused 18 of the 31 dysregulated miRNAs in MI undergoing reversed expression, implying that intentional modulation of miRNA expression might show favorable effects for ischemic heart. Our network analysis identified that, among these miRNAs, the prime players in MI were miR-1, miR-29b and miR-98. Further finding revealed that miR-1 focused on regulation of myocyte growth, yet miR-29b and miR-98 stressed on fibrosis and inflammation, respectively.Our study illustrates how a combination of microarray technology and functional protein network analysis can be used to identify disease-related key miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2075528378,"Dot1L, a histone methyltransferase that targets histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79), has been implicated in gene regulation and the DNA damage response although its functions in these processes remain poorly defined.Using the chicken DT40 model system, we generated cells in which the Dot1L gene is disrupted to examine the function and focal recruitment of the 53Bp1 DNA damage response protein. Detailed kinetic and dose response assays demonstrate that, despite the absence of H3K79 methylation demonstrated by mass spectrometry, 53Bp1 focal recruitment is not compromised in these cells. We also describe, for the first time, the phenotypes of a cell line lacking both Dot1L and 53Bp1. Dot1L⁻/⁻ and wild type cells are equally resistant to ionising radiation, whereas 53Bp1⁻/⁻/Dot1L⁻/⁻ cells display a striking DNA damage resistance phenotype. Dot1L and 53Bp1 also affect the expression of many genes. Loss of Dot1L activity dramatically alters the mRNA levels of over 1200 genes involved in diverse biological functions. These results, combined with the previously reported list of differentially expressed genes in mouse ES cells knocked down for Dot1L, demonstrates surprising cell type and species conservation of Dot1L-dependent gene expression. In 53Bp1⁻/⁻ cells, over 300 genes, many with functions in immune responses and apoptosis, were differentially expressed. To date, this is the first global analysis of gene expression in a 53Bp1-deficient cell line.Taken together, our results uncover a negative role for Dot1L and H3K79 methylation in the DNA damage response in the absence of 53Bp1. They also enlighten the roles of Dot1L and 53Bp1 in gene expression and the control of DNA double-strand repair pathways in the context of chromatin."

However, few researchers have investigated the relationship between a polymorphism in the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and the different components of impulsivity in a non-clinical population. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between a polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and the different components of impulsivity in a non-clinical population.We administered two neuropsychological tests, the Continuous Performance Task and the Iowa Gambling Task, to 127 healthy participants to measure their levels of motor, attentional and non-planning impulsivity. Then, these participants were grouped by genotype and gender, and their scores on impulsivity measures were compared. There were no significant differences between group scores on attentional, motor and non-planning impulsivity.Our results suggest that 5-HTTLPR genotype is not significantly associated with subsets of impulsive behavior in a non-clinical sample when measured by neuropsychological tests. These findings are discussed in terms of the sensitivity of neuropsychological tests to detect impulsivity in a non-clinical population and the role of gender and race in the relationship between the 5-HTTLPR and impulsivity."

This study deals with the biochemical characterization of the InsP6-induced autocatalytic cleavage of C. sordellii lethal toxin and C. novyi α-toxin. For this purpose, exclusively recombinant toxins were used. Although no major differences could be observed in the binding affinity of InsP6 for the CPDs of all CGTs, significant differences between CGTs were observed in the InsP6-induced autocatalytic processing of the holotoxins. In particular, we report on the activation of the InsP6-induced autoproteolytic cleavage of C. sordellii lethal toxin, which suggests differences in the modular organization and function of the toxin domains of the various members of the CGT family. Vero cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% nonessential amino acids (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria), 4 mm penicillin/streptomycin (PAN Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany), and 1% sodium pyruvate (Biochrom AG). Bacillus megaterium (strain WH320; MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) bacteria were cultivated in LB medium at 37 °C. For cloning of C. novyi α-toxin into the B. megaterium expression vector pHIS1522 (MoBiTec), the gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (C. novyi strain 6018) in two parts. First, the upstream sequence of an intrinsic SpeI restriction site at bp 2965 was amplified with oligonucleotides introducing a 5′-BsrGI restriction site, and second, the downstream sequence of the SpeI restriction site was amplified by omitting the stop codon and by introducing a 3′-KpnI restriction site. Subsequent ligation of the two DNA fragments into BsrGI/KpnI-digested pHIS1522 resulted in α-toxin-His6. C. difficile toxin B and C. sordellii lethal toxin were cloned into the same expression vector essentially as described previously (13Papatheodorou P. Zamboglou C. Genisyuerek S. Guttenberg G. Aktories K. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e10673Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Yang G. Zhou B. Wang J. He X. Sun X. Nie W. Tzipori S. Feng H.

For the generation of His-tagged constructs of α-toxin, lethal toxin, and toxin B comprising only the glucosyltransferase domain (toxin B-(1–546)), the CPD, or the glucosyltransferase domain (GD) and the CPD (GD-CPD) in pHIS1522, the corresponding sequences were amplified with oligonucleotides introducing a 5′-BsrGI and a 3′-KpnI restriction site and using the full-length pHIS1522 constructs as template. The ligation of BsrGI/KpnI-digested pHIS1522 vector and PCR products was then performed. Eventually, mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Full-length versions or only parts of toxin B, lethal toxin, and α-toxin that were cloned into the pHIS1522 vector were recombinantly expressed in B. megaterium and purified as His-tagged proteins by nickel affinity chromatography. Briefly, B. megaterium protoplasts were first transformed with plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions (MoBiTec). The cells were then grown at 37 °C in LB medium until A600 nm = 0.3. Subsequently, protein expression was induced by the addition of 5% xylose and by further incubation at 37 °C for 3–6 h or at 29 °C overnight. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 500 μm EDTA) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The bacteria were lysed using a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA) at 15000 p.s.i., and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 164,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was then passed through a pre-equilibrated nickel-charged HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol, and bound His-tagged proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol. In addition, the eluted proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Rac1, Ha-Ras, and RhoA were cloned as GST-tagged versions and purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) essentially as described previously (25Just I. Selzer J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cultured Vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultivated in DMEM to form semiconfluent monolayers prior to washing with PBS and intoxication by the addition of toxins in DMEM at the indicated concentrations. Upon onset of intoxication characteristics (cell rounding), images were taken using an Axiovert 25 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). At the indicated concentrations, full-length toxins or toxin fragments were incubated in glucosylation buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence of 10 μm UDP-[14C]glucose or UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (α-toxin) and 5 μm recombinant Rac1, Ha-Ras, or RhoA for 20–45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. Radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). The in vitro cleavage assay was performed with 2 μg of full-length toxins or toxin fragments either in neutral cleavage buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) or under acidic conditions (100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0)). Cleavage was initiated by the addition of the indicated concentrations of InsP6, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time points. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. Cleavage products were visualized as Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands after SDS-PAGE. Full-length toxins or toxin fragments (1 μm) were incubated with a mixture of 4.8 μm InsP6 and 0.2 μm [3H]InsP6 in binding buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) or 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0), each supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, for 10 min at 4 °C. The reactions were then terminated by rapid vacuum filtration through a prewetted 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman), followed by washing with 3 ml of binding buffer to separate free and bound [3H]InsP6. Membrane-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The Kd values of InsP6 binding to the CPDs of toxin B, lethal toxin, and α-toxin were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC200, GE Healthcare) at 25 °C under neutral pH conditions in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol or under acidic conditions in buffer containing 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5), 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. The reaction cell was filled with 50–100 μm protein, and InsP6 was injected at 10-fold higher concentrations. As a control, InsP6 was injected alone into the cell filled with buffer only. Data were evaluated with the manufacturer's software. Studies by Pruitt et al. (21Pruitt R.N. Chagot B. Cover M. Chazin W.J. Spiller B. Lacy D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21934-21940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) delimited the CPD of toxin A to amino acids 543–809 (corresponding to amino acids 544–807 in toxin B). Sequence comparison of toxins A and B with lethal toxin and α-toxin revealed putative CPDs of lethal toxin and α-toxin at residues 544–807 and 549–813, respectively. To study the autocatalytic cleavage of the toxins, we therefore expressed toxin fragments consisting of the GDs and the putative CPDs from various CGTs (toxin B-(1–807), lethal toxin-(1–807), and α-toxin-(1–813)). An in vitro cleavage assay was then performed by incubation of increasing concentrations of InsP6 with the respective GD-CPD fragments of toxins. As shown in Fig. 1A, InsP6-induced autocatalytic processing was detected with each toxin fragment at concentrations of 0.1–1 μm InsP6. Thus, autocatalytic processing of all CGT members occurred independently of any domains that are located beyond the intrinsic CPD. Recently, the cleavage sites of the CPDs in toxins A and B, as well as amino acids that are crucial for the activity of the protease, were characterized (17Egerer M. Giesemann T. Jank T. Satchell K.J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25314-25321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19Rupnik M. Pabst S. Rupnik M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Urlaub H.

Chem. 2009; 284: 21934-21940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To identify the cleavage sites and the catalytically active cysteine residues of lethal toxin and α-toxin, a sequence comparison of all CGTs was performed. The multiple alignments of CGT sequences surrounding the cleavage sites and the catalytically active cysteine residues of toxins A and B is depicted in Fig. 1B. This analysis revealed the cleavage sites Leu-543 and Leu-548 for lethal toxin and α-toxin, respectively. Furthermore, by sequence comparison, we identified Cys-698 and Cys-707 as catalytic cysteine residues of the CPDs of lethal toxin and α-toxin, respectively. The in silico data were confirmed by mutagenesis studies. A change of the proposed catalytic cysteine residues of the three toxin fragments (C698A-toxin B-(1–807), C698A-lethal toxin-(1–807), and C707A-α-toxin-(1–813)) to alanine inhibited autocatalytic cleavage in the presence of 100 μm InsP6. Moreover, we corroborated the proposed cleavage sites by mutation. Again, all cleavage site mutants (L543A/G543A-toxin B-(1–807), L543A/G543A-lethal toxin-(1–807), and L548A/N549A-α-toxin-(1–813)) were stable toward autocatalytic cleavage. In vitro glucosylation of Rac1 in the presence of radiolabeled UDP-glucose (or UDP-GlcNAc for α-toxin) was performed with each GD-CPD mutant, showing that the recombinant proteins were correctly folded, because Rac1 was modified in comparable levels by the mutants compared with wild-type GD-CPD fragments (Fig. 1D). A prerequisite of the autoproteolytic cleavage of the CGTs is the binding of InsP6 to the CPD. We compared the binding affinity of InsP6 for the CPDs by isothermal titration calorimetry at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2, A–C). The studies were performed with the recombinant CPDs. Titrations were carried out twice and yielded Kd values of 4.4 and 5.1 μm for toxin B-(544–807), 2.1 and 2.8 μm for lethal toxin-(544–807), and 6.7 and 8.9 μm for α-toxin-(549–813). These results indicated that InsP6 has a similar affinity for binding to the CPD of each CGT. The stoichiometries of the complex were 0.81 and 0.85 for toxin B-(544–807), 0.64 and 0.84 for lethal toxin-(544–807), and 0.74 and 0.77 for α-toxin-(549–813), indicating that InsP6 binds to all CPDs of the toxins at a ratio of 1:1. For biochemical characterization of the autocatalytic cleavage of the full-length CGTs, we expressed the proteins in B. megaterium. Fig. 3A shows the SDS-PAGE of the purified recombinant proteins. To test the glucosyltransferase activity of the toxins, in vitro glucosylation assays were performed with Rac1, Ha-Ras, and RhoA in the presence of radiolabeled UDP-[14C]glucose (or UDP-[14C]GlcNAc for α-toxin) as a donor substrate. As expected, incorporation of radiolabeled glucose (or GlcNAc) was detected only in Rac1 and RhoA with toxin B or α-toxin and only in Rac1 and Ha-Ras with lethal toxin (Fig. 3B), confirming same substrate specificity as described for the native toxins (3Just I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Moreover, the addition of recombinant CGTs to cultured Vero cells induced phenotypic alterations in cell morphology (e.g. cell rounding) that are typical for cytotoxicity (Fig. 3C). This finding implies the proper folding of domains of the recombinant CGTs implicated in the uptake of the proteins into endosomal compartments and the release of the GD into the cytosol. Next, the autocatalytic processing of the recombinant full-length CGTs was studied in in vitro cleavage assays at pH 7.4 with increasing concentrations of InsP6. Surprisingly, significant autocatalytic cleavage of CGTs at physiological concentrations of InsP6 (≤100 μm) was observed only for toxin B and α-toxin (Fig. 3D). In contrast, lethal toxin exhibited much less autocatalytic processing at up to 10 mm InsP6. Also the time course of InsP6 (100 μm)-induced autocatalysis revealed that full-length lethal toxin was much less processed (even after overnight incubation) under the conditions used (Fig. 3E). Obviously, in contrast to CGT fragments consisting of the GD and CPD, full-length CGTs differed in their susceptibility to InsP6-induced autocatalytic processing. Because full-length lethal toxin showed no autocatalytic cleavage upon incubation with InsP6 under in vitro conditions, we aimed to determine the biological significance of autocatalytic processing by performing intoxication assays on cultured Vero cells with lethal toxin carrying an inactive CPD (C698A-lethal toxin). Accordingly, CPD-inactive toxin mutants were also synthesized for toxin B (C698A-toxin B) and α-toxin (C707A-α-toxin). Interestingly, a lack of cytotoxicity compared with wild-type toxins was observed not only for the CPD-inactive toxin B and α-toxin mutants but also for the CPD mutant of lethal toxin (Fig. 4A). Therefore, CPD-dependent processing represents an essential step in complete intoxication not only by toxin B and α-toxin but also by lethal toxin. The inability of the CPD-inactive toxin mutants to undergo autocatalytic processing was confirmed in vitro by incubation with InsP6 (Fig. 4B). In addition, to exclude the possibility that the lethal toxin and α-toxin mutants lack cytotoxicity due to general misfolding, a time-dependent in vitro glucosylation assay with recombinant Rac1 was performed. Similar kcat values for the wild-type and mutant lethal toxins (912.6 ± 37.1 h−1 (S.D.) versus 1098 ± 84.9 h−1) and α-toxins (120.1 ± 29.8 h−1 (S.D.) versus 187.8 ± 54.6 h−1) were calculated from three time points in the linear range (5, 10, and 15 min), confirming that the CPD-inactive mutants are fully active in glucosyltransferase or GlcNAc-transferase activity (Fig. 4C). The importance of the autocatalytic cleavage in the intoxication process was demonstrated for toxins A and B previously (17Egerer M. Giesemann T. Jank T. Satchell K.J. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25314-25321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 27Kreimeyer I. Euler F. Marckscheffel A. Tatge H. Pich A. Olling A. Schwarz J. Just I. Gerhard R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2011; 383: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because autocatalytic processing of full-length lethal toxin was not induced by incubation with InsP6, we wondered whether steric hindrance may prevent binding of InsP6 to the CPD. Therefore, we studied the direct interaction of InsP6 with the full-length CGT. Because isothermal titration calorimetry is hampered by the large size of full-length toxins (note that very large amounts of toxins would be necessary), we employed a filter binding assay. To this end, recombinant holotoxins were preincubated with radiolabeled [3H]InsP6 at neutral pH, and non-bound InsP6 was removed by filtration through nitrocellulose filters. These binding studies revealed significant binding of InsP6 to full-length variants of toxin B and α-toxin but not lethal toxin (Fig. 5A). CGTs are clathrin-dependently endocytosed to reach low pH endosomes (13Papatheodorou P. Zamboglou C. Genisyuerek S. Guttenberg G. Aktories K. PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e10673Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the low pH triggers conformational changes within CGTs, thereby enabling the insertion of the toxins into endosomal membranes (28Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We speculated that conformational changes induced by low pH may be a prerequisite for InsP6 binding to the CPD of lethal toxin. Therefore, we studied the autocatalytic cleavage of full-length lethal toxin with increasing concentrations of InsP6 at pH 5 and compared the results with the processing of the short toxin fragments (GD-CPD), which consisted of the GD and CPD. Interestingly, full-length lethal toxin and GD-CPD fragments were processed equally at physiological concentrations of InsP6 (10–100 μm) at low pH (Fig. 5B). Apparently, low pH-induced rearrangements within full-length lethal toxin enabled binding of InsP6, activation of the CPD, and subsequent autocatalytic cleavage. Accordingly, a filter binding assay performed with InsP6 and full-length lethal toxin at pH 5 revealed binding of InsP6 under low pH conditions (Fig. 5C). Direct comparison of InsP6 binding of lethal toxin with that of toxin B showed that the latter toxin exhibited maximal binding at pH 7.4 and reduced binding at pH 5 (Fig. 5D). We next asked whether the binding of InsP6 to full-length lethal toxin is reversibly controlled by the pH of the incubation medium. For this purpose, lethal toxin was first incubated in buffer at pH 7.4. The samples were then acidified to pH 5, and thereafter, the mixture was again brought to pH 7.4, which was followed by the binding assay with radiolabeled InsP6. As shown in Fig. 5E, InsP6 did not bind to full-length lethal toxin after readjustment of the medium from acidic pH to pH 7.4. In contrast, toxin B, which was tested in parallel, partially bound InsP6 after preincubation in acidic buffer and readjustment to neutral pH (Fig. 5E). Moreover, we determined the influence of acidification on binding of InsP6 to the CPD fragment of lethal toxin by isothermal titration calorimetry. This study revealed that, at low pH (pH 5), the CPD of lethal toxin exhibited an ∼10-fold reduced affinity for InsP6 (Kd = 33.0 and 40.4 μm) compared with results obtained at neutral pH (Figs. 2C and 5F). These data indicate that the low pH shift facilitated binding of InsP6 only to full-length lethal toxin but not to the GD-CPD fragment, supporting the notion that the holotoxin undergoes a major conformational change at low pH, which allows InsP6 binding. Here, we studied the InsP6-dependent autocatalytic processing of three CGTs. Initial studies with short fragments of the toxins covering the glucosyltransferase (GlcNAc-transferase of α-toxin) domain and the CPD revealed that all toxins needed InsP6 for cleavage. This is not surprising because the CPDs of lethal toxin and α-toxin are 78 and 34% identical to the CPD of toxin B, and the proposed catalytic triad (toxin B Asp-587/His-653/Cys-698) and the InsP6-binding sites are highly conserved among the toxins. Accordingly, we determined very similar Kd values for the binding of InsP6 to the toxin protease domains. Moreover, the concentration range of InsP6 needed for cleavage was similar, indicating that the mechanism of InsP6-induced activation of the protease activity is similar among all these toxins. In addition, we predicted and confirmed the cleavage sites of all three toxins by mutagenesis studies, indicating that the toxins are split after a conserved leucine residue. Whereas the short fragments covering the glucosyltransferase (GlcNAc-transferase of α-toxin) domains and CPDs of the toxins exhibited similar properties with respect to InsP6 binding and activation, full-length toxins differed significantly. Although full-length toxin B and α-toxin exhibited InsP6 sensitivity at 1 and 100 μm, respectively, lethal toxin was much more resistant against autocatalytic cleavage even at high concentrations of InsP6 (≥1 mm). Moreover, we were not able to detect significant binding of InsP6 to lethal toxin in filter binding assays, whereas toxin B and α-toxin exhibited InsP6 binding under these conditions. This discrepancy was not caused by misfolding of recombinant B. megaterium-expressed proteins because glucosyltransferase activity and cytotoxicity were confirmed, indicating proper folding of the proteins. To study the impact of toxin processing on cytotoxicity of full-length toxins, we changed the catalytic cysteine residues of the CPD to alanine. This resulted in inhibition of cytotoxicity of all three toxins, including lethal toxin, which was largely resistant to in vitro processing even in the presence of a high concentration of InsP6. These findings indicate that also processing of lethal toxin is essential for full cytotoxicity. As CGTs translocate from acidic endosomal compartments into the cytosol (11Jank T. Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 28Barth H. Pfeifer G. Hofmann F. Maier E. Benz R. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Qa'Dan M. Spyres L.M. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2470-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we wondered whether incubation at low pH might affect the susceptibility of the toxins to InsP6. We observed that lowering the pH strongly increased the autocatalytic cleavage of full-length lethal toxin in the presence of InsP6. In line with this finding, we observed that the binding of InsP6 to full-length lethal toxin was largely increased at low pH. This effect was most likely caused by conformational changes in the overall structure of lethal toxin and not only by charge effects at the binding site. A decrease in the pH should rather reduce the binding of the negatively charged InsP6 to the toxin. This was confirmed in a direct comparison of the InsP6 binding of full-length lethal toxin with that of full-length toxin B at different pH values. Whereas the binding of InsP6 to lethal toxin increased at low pH, the reverse was true for toxin B. The notion that, at low pH, the binding of InsP6 to its binding pocket at the cysteine protease is reduced was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry with the isolated protease domain of lethal toxin, showing an ∼10-fold reduced binding affinity for InsP6. Thus, these findings indicate that the pH shift causes major conformational changes in the overall structure of lethal toxin, resulting in exposure and/or structural changes in the CPD, allowing InsP6 binding. Major pH-dependent structural changes in lethal toxin have been reported before. Ballard and co-workers (30Qa'Dan M. Spyres L.M. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5487-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that the cytotoxicity of C. sordellii lethal toxin is increased in a pH-dependent manner. A short pH pulse strongly increased the velocity of cytotoxic effects. They showed major conformational changes in lethal toxin by fluorescence methods at low pH, which were reversible (30Qa'Dan M. Spyres L.M. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5487-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data are in agreement with our studies, indicating that, at low pH, a major conformational change in the toxin exposes the InsP6-binding site and allows binding of InsP6 and subsequent autocatalytic processing. As processing is important for activity, low pH exposure of the toxin results in an increase in cytotoxicity. More recently, it was proposed that lethal toxin forms high molecular complexes, which dissociate at low pH and reassociate after an increase in pH (31Voth D.E. Qa'Dan M. Hamm E.E. Pelfrey J.M. Ballard J.D. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3366-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We suggest that these studies performed with native lethal toxin purified from C. sordellii might be biased by pH-dependent impurities, which could affect complex formation. We used recombinant toxins expressed in B. megaterium. By gel filtration of recombinant full-length lethal toxin, we could confirm a monodisperse preparation of monomers. Therefore, formation of multimeric toxin complexes most likely did not play a major role in our studies. However, we also observed reversibility of the pH-dependent effect. After readjustment of the low pH to pH 7.4, the binding of InsP6 and the processing of the toxin were again inhibited. This finding indicates that the proposed pH-dependent conformational change, which allows InsP6 binding, is largely reversible. Recent studies solved the crystal structures of the GDs of C. difficile toxin B (32Reinert D.J. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and C. novyi α-toxin and C. sordellii lethal toxin (33Ziegler M.O. Jank T. Aktories K. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 1346-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); the CPD of toxin A (21Pruitt R.N. Chagot B. Cover M. Chazin W.J. Spiller B. Lacy D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21934-21940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); and parts of the C-terminal repetitive oligopeptide domain (34Ho J.G. Greco A. Rupnik M. Ng K.K. Proc.

Biol. 2006; 13: 460-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the structure of the holotoxin is still enigmatic. Related CPD structures are available not only for toxin A but also for Vibrio cholerae MARTX toxin. Notably, both CPDs share conserved lysine residues, which are involved in InsP6 binding. However, the conformation of the bound allosteric activator is largely different in the CPDs of toxin A and MARTX (21Pruitt R.N. Chagot B. Cover M. Chazin W.J. Spiller B. Lacy D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21934-21940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Egerer M. Satchell K.J.

Chem. 2009; 284: 26557-26568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because the InsP6-binding properties of the isolated CPDs of toxin B, α-toxin, and lethal toxin are very similar, we do not suggest that major structural differences exist in the CPDs of these toxins. Therefore, structural features located distantly to the CPD may affect the conformation and binding of InsP6 to the CPD in full-length lethal toxin. A recent study with negative stain electron microscopy revealed a model of holotoxins A and B and proposed conformational changes occurring at the low pH of endosomes (37Pruitt R.N. Chambers M.G. Ng K.K. Ohi M.D. Lacy D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13467-13472Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this model, the large extension of the C-terminal domain is remarkable, not even excluding interaction with N-terminal structures of the toxins. Especially the C-terminal polypeptide repeat domain, which has an extended solenoid-like structure, differs between the various CGTs. Therefore, it remains to be studied whether the C-terminal domain is involved in the different susceptibility of holotoxins to InsP6. What is the physiological reason for the unique, low pH-dependent InsP6-binding properties of lethal toxin? One might speculate that C. sordellii has adopted to environments that frequently exhibit high concentrations of extracellular InsP6. The disintegration of cells in wounds and injured tissues (frequent sites of C. sordellii infection) would allow cytosolic InsP6 to reach extracellular compartments. Unique structural characteristics of lethal toxin under neutral pH conditions thereby prevent activation of the CPD by InsP6 binding prior to cell entry. Such prerequisites might not be necessary for C. difficile toxin B, for example, because phytase enzymes that hydrolyze extracellular luminal InsP6 efficiently are present in the small intestine (38Iqbal T.H. Lewis K.O. Cooper B.T. Gut. 1994; 35: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After endocytosis, however, all CGTs are exposed to endosomal acidification, resulting in partial unfolding and/or activation of domains involved in membrane insertion and delivery of the enzyme portions across the endosomal membrane. Eventually, the CPD is accessible for InsP6-driven activation, leading to the release of the glucosyltransferase into the cytosol. However, one has to keep in mind that activation of the CPD and release of the GD should not occur before entering the cytosol. Otherwise, the delivery of the biologically active part is altered. Therefore, it makes sense that the affinity of toxin B for InsP6 is reduced at low pH (e.g. which is observed in endosomes). We greatly appreciate the excellent technical assistance of Otilia Wunderlich and Sven Hornei."
https://openalex.org/W1978219416,"Soluble guanylate cyclase is an NO-sensing hemoprotein that serves as a NO receptor in NO-mediated signaling pathways. It has been believed that this enzyme displays no measurable affinity for O(2), thereby enabling the selective NO sensing in aerobic environments. Despite the physiological significance, the reactivity of the enzyme-heme for O(2) has not been examined in detail. In this paper we demonstrated that the high spin heme of the ferrous enzyme converted to a low spin oxyheme (Fe(2+)-O(2)) when frozen at 77 K in the presence of O(2). The ligation of O(2) was confirmed by EPR analyses using cobalt-substituted enzyme. The oxy form was produced also under solution conditions at -7 °C, with the extremely low affinity for O(2). The low O(2) affinity was not caused by a distal steric protein effect and by rupture of the Fe(2+)-proximal His bond as revealed by extended x-ray absorption fine structure. The midpoint potential of the enzyme-heme was +187 mV, which is the most positive among high spin protoheme-hemoproteins. This observation implies that the electron density of the ferrous heme iron is relatively low by comparison to those of other hemoproteins, presumably due to the weak Fe(2+)-proximal His bond. Based on our results, we propose that the weak Fe(2+)-proximal His bond is a key determinant for the low O(2) affinity of the heme moiety of soluble guanylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W2114136152,"Epidemiological association of head and neck cancer with smokeless tobacco (ST) emphasizes the need to unravel the molecular mechanisms implicated in cancer development, and identify pharmacologically safe agents for early intervention and prevention of disease recurrence. Guggulsterone (GS), a biosafe nutraceutical, inhibits the PI3K/Akt pathway that plays a critical role in HNSCC development. However, the potential of GS to suppress ST and nicotine (major component of ST) induced HNSCC remains unexplored. We hypothesized GS can abrogate the effects of ST and nicotine on apoptosis in HNSCC cells, in part by activation of PI3K/Akt pathway and its downstream targets, Bax and Bad.Our results showed ST and nicotine treatment resulted in activation of PI3K, PDK1, Akt, and its downstream proteins--Raf, GSK3β and pS6 while GS induced a time dependent decrease in activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. ST and nicotine treatment also resulted in induction of Bad and Bax phosphorylation, increased the association of Bad with 14-3-3ζresulting in its sequestration in the cytoplasm of head and neck cancer cells, thus blocking its pro-apoptotic function. Notably, GS pre-treatment inhibited ST/nicotine induced activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, and inhibited the Akt mediated phosphorylation of Bax and Bad.In conclusion, GS treatment not only inhibited proliferation, but also induced apoptosis by abrogating the effects of ST/nicotine on PI3K/Akt pathway in head and neck cancer cells. These findings provide a rationale for designing future studies to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of GS in ST/nicotine associated head and neck cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2149769490,"Grc3 is an evolutionarily conserved protein. Genome-wide budding yeast studies suggest that Grc3 is involved in rRNA processing. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Grc3 was identified as a factor exhibiting distinct nuclear dot localization, yet its exact physiological function remains unknown. Here, we show that S. pombe Grc3 is required for both rRNA processing and heterochromatic gene silencing. Cytological analysis revealed that Grc3 nuclear dots correspond to heterochromatic regions and that some Grc3 is also present in the nucleolar peripheral region. Depleting the heterochromatic proteins Swi6 or Clr4 abolished heterochromatic localization of Grc3 and resulted in its preferential accumulation in the perinucleolar region, suggesting its dynamic association with these nuclear compartments. Cells expressing mutant grc3 showed defects in 25 S rRNA maturation and in heterochromatic gene silencing. Protein analysis of Grc3-containing complexes led to the identification of Las1 and components of the IPI complex (Rix1, Ipi1, and Crb3). All of these Grc3-interacting proteins showed a dynamic nuclear localization similar to that observed for Grc3, and those conditional mutants showed defects in both rRNA processing and silencing of centromeric transcripts. Our data suggest that Grc3 functions cooperatively with Las1 and the IPI complex in both ribosome biogenesis and heterochromatin assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2003084376,"Many proteins are modified after their synthesis, by the addition of a lipid molecule to one or more cysteine residues, through a thioester bond. This modification is called S-acylation, and more commonly palmitoylation. This reaction is carried out by a family of enzymes, called palmitoyltransferases (PATs), characterized by the presence of a conserved 50- aminoacids domain called ""Asp-His-His-Cys- Cysteine Rich Domain"" (DHHC-CRD). There are 7 members of this family in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and each of these proteins is thought to be responsible for the palmitoylation of a subset of substrates. Substrate specificity of PATs, however, is not yet fully understood. Several yeast PATs seem to have overlapping specificity, and it has been proposed that the machinery responsible for palmitoylating peripheral membrane proteins in mammalian cells, lacks specificity altogether.Here we investigate the specificity of transmembrane protein palmitoylation in S. cerevisiae, which is carried out predominantly by two PATs, Swf1 and Pfa4. We show that palmitoylation of transmembrane substrates requires dedicated PATs, since other yeast PATs are mostly unable to perform Swf1 or Pfa4 functions, even when overexpressed. Furthermore, we find that Swf1 is highly specific for its substrates, as it is unable to substitute for other PATs. To identify where Swf1 specificity lies, we carried out a bioinformatics survey to identify amino acids responsible for the determination of specificity or Specificity Determination Positions (SDPs) and showed experimentally, that mutation of the two best SDP candidates, A145 and K148, results in complete and partial loss of function, respectively. These residues are located within the conserved catalytic DHHC domain suggesting that it could also be involved in the determination of specificity. Finally, we show that modifying the position of the cysteines in Tlg1, a Swf1 substrate, results in lack of palmitoylation, as expected for a highly specific enzymatic reaction."

Here, we explore different sets of minimal absent words in the genomes of 22 organisms (one archaeota, thirteen bacteria and eight eukaryotes). We investigate if the mutational biases that may explain the deficit of the shortest absent words in vertebrates are also pervasive in other absent words, namely in minimal absent words, as well as to other organisms. We find that the compositional biases observed for the shortest absent words in vertebrates are not uniform throughout different sets of minimal absent words. We further investigate the hypothesis of the inheritance of minimal absent words through common ancestry from the similarity in dinucleotide relative abundances of different sets of minimal absent words, and find that this inheritance may be exclusive to vertebrates."

Asymptomatic multiclonal P. falciparum infections are common and may predict host protection. Here, we have investigated the effect of clearing asymptomatic infections on the risk of clinical malaria. Methods Malaria episodes were continuously monitored in 405 children (1–6 years) in an area of moderate transmission, coastal Kenya. Blood samples collected on four occasions were assessed by genotyping the polymorphic P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 using fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis. Following the second survey, asymptomatic infections were cleared with a full course of dihydroartemisinin. Results Children who were parasite negative by PCR had a lower risk of subsequent malaria regardless of whether treatment had been given. Children with ≥2 clones had a reduced risk of febrile malaria compared with 1 clone after clearance of asymptomatic infections, but not if asymptomatic infections were not cleared. Multiclonal infection was associated with an increased risk of re-infection after drug treatment. However, among the children who were re-infected, multiclonal infections were associated with a shift from clinical malaria to asymptomatic parasitaemia. Conclusion The number of clones was associated with exposure as well as blood stage immunity. These effects were distinguished by clearing asymptomatic infection with anti-malarials. Exposure to multiple P. falciparum infections is associated with protective immunity, but there appears to be an additional effect in untreated multiclonal infections that offsets this protective effect."
https://openalex.org/W2102258386,"Apoptosis operates to eliminate damaged or potentially dangerous cells. This loss is often compensated by extra proliferation of neighboring cells. Studies in Drosophila imaginal discs suggest that the signal for the additional growth emanates from the dying cells. In particular, it was suggested that the initiator caspase Dronc mediates compensatory proliferation (CP) through Dp53 in wing discs. However, the exact mechanism that governs this CP remained poorly understood. We have previously shown that elimination of misspecified cells due to reduced Dpp signaling is achieved by the interaction of the co-repressor NAB with the transcriptional repressor Brk, which in turn induces Jun N-terminal kinase-dependent apoptosis. Here, we performed a systematic in vivo loss- and gain-of-function analysis to study NAB-induced death and CP. Our findings indicate that the NAB primary signal activates JNK, which in turn transmits two independent signals. One triggers apoptosis through the pro-apoptotic proteins Reaper and Hid, which in turn promote activation of caspases by the apoptosome components Ark and Dronc. The other signal induces CP in a manner that is independent of the death signal, Dronc, or Dp53. Once induced, the apoptotic pathway further activates a CP response. Our data suggest that JNK is the candidate factor that differentiates between apoptosis that involves CP and apoptosis that does not."
https://openalex.org/W2068973167,"Redoxins are involved in maintenance of thiol redox homeostasis, but their exact sites of action are only partly known. We have applied a combined redox proteomics and transcriptomics experimental strategy to discover specific functions of two interacting redoxins: dually localized glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2p) and mitochondrial peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1p). We have identified 139 proteins showing differential postranslational thiol redox modifications when the cells do not express Grx2p, Prx1p, or both and have mapped the precise cysteines involved in each case. Some of these modifications constitute functional switches that affect metabolic and signaling pathways as the primary effect, leading to gene transcription remodeling as the secondary adaptive effect as demonstrated by a parallel high throughput gene expression analysis. The results suggest that in the absence of Grx2p, the metabolic flow toward nucleotide and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis is slowed down by redox modification of the key enzymes Rpe1p (D-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase), Tkl1p (transketolase) and Aro4p (3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase). The glycolytic mainstream is then diverted toward carbohydrate storage by induction of trehalose and glycogen biosynthesis genes. Porphyrin biosynthesis may also be compromised by inactivation of the redox-sensitive cytosolic enzymes Hem12p (uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase) and Sam1p (S-adenosyl methionine synthetase) and a battery of respiratory genes sensitive to low heme levels are induced. Genes of the Aft1p-dependent iron regulon were induced specifically in the absence of Prx1p despite optimal mitochondrial Fe-S biogenesis, suggesting dysfunction of the mitochondria to the cytosol signaling pathway. Strikingly, requirement of Grx2p for these events places dithiolic Grx2 in the framework of iron metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1971196261,"Schwann cells (SCs) are the cell type responsible for the formation of the myelin sheath in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). As retinoic acid (RA) and other retinoids have a profound effect as regulators of the myelination program, we sought to investigate how their nuclear receptors levels were regulated in this cell type.In the present study, by using Schwann cells primary cultures from neonatal Wistar rat pups, as well as myelinating cocultures of Schwann cells with embryonic rat dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons, we have found that sustained expression of RXR-γ depends on the continuous presence of a labile activator, while axonal contact mimickers produced an increase in RXR-γ mRNA and protein levels, increment that could be prevented by RA. The upregulation by axonal contact mimickers and the transcriptional downregulation by RA were dependent on de novo protein synthesis and did not involve changes in mRNA stability. On the other hand, RAR-β mRNA levels were only slightly modulated by axonal contact mimickers, while RA produced a strong transcriptional upregulation that was independent of de novo protein synthesis without changes in mRNA stability.All together, our results show that retinoid receptors are regulated in a complex manner in Schwann cells, suggesting that they could have a prominent role as regulators of Schwann cell physiology."
