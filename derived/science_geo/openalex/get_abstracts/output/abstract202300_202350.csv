Periodate oxidation of the neuraminic acid backbone of sialic acids results in the formation of β -formylpyruvic acid from carbon atoms 1 to 4. The N -acetyl or N -glycolyl group of sialic acids apparently does not interfere with periodate oxidation. β -Formylpyruvic acid is coupled with 2-thiobarbituric acid to form a red chromophore with a maximum absorption at 549 mμ. It is found that as only free sialic acids are reactive in the assay, hydrolysis of sialic acid-containing material must be carried out for the measurement of total sialic acids. The assay is suitable for measuring the release of bound sialic acid by sialidase. A series of 2-keto, 3-deoxy sugar acids, found in bacteria, also react in the thiobarbituric acid assay. These produce a chromogen with a peak at 549 mμ. They can be readily distinguished from sialic acids because they are not reactive in the orcinol or direct Ehrlich assays for sialic acids. The hydrolysis frees all the sialic acids from several mucoproteins that have been tested except for brain tissue where release of sialic acids takes place for several hours."

The results of these experiments are presented here. In addition, observations on the interconversions of these particular fatty acids, within the limits posed by use of carboxy labeling, are outlined and the effect of these interconversions on the apparent incorporation of ingested fatty acids into lipides is reported."

https://openalex.org/W3118754862,"A broad spectral absorbance band in the near infrared region of cytochrome oxidase* (cf. Fig. 1) was first reported by Griffiths and Wharton (2). They observed that this band near 830 rnp disappeared on complete reduction of the enzyme by substrate and reappeared on reoxidation. The rate of these changes was roughly equivalent to the rate of the changes observed in the a-peak at 605 rnp. In addition, they found that in the presence of cyanide the chromophore could be reduced but could not be reosidized. Recent,ly, Gibson and Greenwood2 observed, through the use of rapid reaction techniques, that the kinetics of the changes in the absorbance of cytochrome oxidase in the near infrared region and in the or-band were essentially identical, These data support the hypothesis that the chromophore absorbing near 830 rnp is an integral component of cytochrome oxidase, but they do not identify the chromophore. The accumulat’ing evidence that many copper-containing prot,eins exhibit absorption bands in the near infrared region (3-6), together with the demonstration that purified preparations of cytochrome oxidase contain copper (2, 7-12), directed our attention toward the possibliity that this metal may be a constituent of the chromophore in question. In this communication, experiments are described that establish a precise correlation among the intensity of the near infrared band, the copper content, and specific activity. This correlation persists as the values of these entities are decreased or obliterated by a variety of treatments and are partially restored by others."

https://openalex.org/W16929200,"(Received for publication, March 19, 1959) The present work is concerned with an analysis of some factors which determine the distribution of glucose between isolated lymph node cells and extracellular medium. Such information is relevant to the increasing interest in the role of permeability in the regulation of cell metabolism. Studies of permeability of isolated mammalian cells have utilized erythrocytes almost exclusively (2). More recently, ascites tumor cells have been used for this purpose (3, 4). In respect to correlations between distribution and utilization of glucose, skeletal muscle has been shown to be a suitable tissue (5). For correlating permeability and metabolism, one wishes ideally to measure simultaneously the rate of penetration and the rates of metabolic conversion of a penetrant. For this purpose, isolated cells should offer advantages over more complex tissue prepara- tions, such as skeletal muscle. In the present study, isolated lymph node cells were used. These cells, which are readily obtainable as single cell suspen- sions, are active in the formation of antibodies and y-globulins and are more representative of mammalian cells, in general, than are erythrocytes or ascites tumor cells. Lymph node cells were found to be well suited for determination of the rate of glucose utilization, since they exhibit high glycolytic activities and con- tain, in contrast to muscle, only trace amounts of glycogen. Complications arising from glycogenolysis (5) could, therefore, he excluded. Unfortunately, however, penetration of glucose into lymph node cells was too fast, even at O”, for determination of rate constants for entry. In view of this limitation, intracel- lular sugar concentrations were evaluated in the steady state, i.e. when intracellular sugar concentrations were constant with time. Utilization of glucose or other rapidly metabolized sugars was measured concomitantly with distribution. Information concerning interrelationships between permeability and utiliza- tion was obtained by deliberately altering one or both of these processes. * A preliminary report was given at the 42nd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Biological Chemists in Chicago (1) and at the IV. International Congress of Biochemistry, Vienna,"
