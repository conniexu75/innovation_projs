https://openalex.org/W2124580054,"In innate immune responses, activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggers direct antimicrobial activity against intracellular bacteria, which in murine, but not human, monocytes and macrophages is mediated principally by nitric oxide. We report here that TLR activation of human macrophages up-regulated expression of the vitamin D receptor and the vitamin D-1–hydroxylase genes, leading to induction of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin and killing of intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis . We also observed that sera from African-American individuals, known to have increased susceptibility to tuberculosis, had low 25-hydroxyvitamin D and were inefficient in supporting cathelicidin messenger RNA induction. These data support a link between TLRs and vitamin D–mediated innate immunity and suggest that differences in ability of human populations to produce vitamin D may contribute to susceptibility to microbial infection."

https://openalex.org/W1991221096,"The transcription factor NF-κB modulates apoptotic responses induced by genotoxic stress. We show that NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), the regulatory subunit of IκB kinase (IKK) (which phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκB), associates with activated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) after the induction of DNA double-strand breaks. ATM phosphorylates serine-85 of NEMO to promote its ubiquitin-dependent nuclear export. ATM is also exported in a NEMO-dependent manner to the cytoplasm, where it associates with and causes the activation of IKK in a manner dependent on another IKK regulator, a protein rich in glutamate, leucine, lysine, and serine (ELKS). Thus, regulated nuclear shuttling of NEMO links two signaling kinases, ATM and IKK, to activate NF-κB by genotoxic signals."

Here we show that finding optimal quantum circuits is essentially equivalent to finding the shortest path between two points in a certain curved geometry. By recasting the problem of finding quantum circuits as a geometric problem, we open up the possibility of using the mathematical techniques of Riemannian geometry to suggest new quantum algorithms or to prove limitations on the power of quantum computers."
https://openalex.org/W2150635644,"A significant impediment to the widespread use of noninvasive in vivo vascular imaging techniques is the current lack of suitable intravital imaging probes. We describe here a new strategy to use viral nanoparticles as a platform for the multivalent display of fluorescent dyes to image tissues deep inside living organisms. The bioavailable cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) can be fluorescently labeled to high densities with no measurable quenching, resulting in exceptionally bright particles with in vivo dispersion properties that allow high-resolution intravital imaging of vascular endothelium for periods of at least 72 h. We show that CPMV nanoparticles can be used to visualize the vasculature and blood flow in living mouse and chick embryos to a depth of up to 500 microm. Furthermore, we show that the intravital visualization of human fibrosarcoma-mediated tumor angiogenesis using fluorescent CPMV provides a means to identify arterial and venous vessels and to monitor the neovascularization of the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2074196765,"Singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) is a highly reactive species formed through solar irradiation of organic matter in environmental waters. Implicated in a range of reactions, it has proven difficult to quantify its spatial distribution in natural waters. We assessed the microheterogeneous distribution of 1 O 2 in irradiated solutions containing chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) by using molecular probes of varying hydrophobicity. The apparent 1 O 2 concentrations ([ 1 O 2 ] app ), measured by recently developed hydrophobic trap-and-trigger chemiluminescent probe molecules, were orders of magnitude higher than those measured by the conventional hydrophilic probe molecule furfuryl alcohol. The differential [ 1 O 2 ] app values measured by these probes reflect a steep concentration gradient between the CDOM macromolecules and the aqueous phase. A detailed kinetic model based on the data predicts probabilistic 1 O 2 distributions under different solvent conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2092991947,"Apoptosis in the immune system is critical for maintaining self-tolerance and preventing autoimmunity. Nevertheless, inhibiting apoptosis in lymphocytes is not alone sufficient to break self-tolerance, suggesting the involvement of other cell types. We investigated whether apoptosis in dendritic cells (DCs) helps regulate self-tolerance by generating transgenic mice expressing the baculoviral caspase inhibitor, p35, in DCs (DC-p35). DC-p35 mice displayed defective DC apoptosis, resulting in their accumulation and, in turn, chronic lymphocyte activation and systemic autoimmune manifestations. The observation that a defect in DC apoptosis can independently lead to autoimmunity is consistent with a central role for these cells in maintaining immune self-tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2072292705,"Recent observations support the suggestion that short-duration gamma-ray bursts are produced by compact star mergers. The x-ray flares discovered in two short gamma-ray bursts last much longer than the previously proposed postmerger energy-release time scales. Here, we show that they can be produced by differentially rotating, millisecond pulsars after the mergers of binary neutron stars. The differential rotation leads to windup of interior poloidal magnetic fields and the resulting toroidal fields are strong enough to float up and break through the stellar surface. Magnetic reconnection-driven explosive events then occur, leading to multiple x-ray flares minutes after the original gamma-ray burst."

Suppression of Wnt signaling impairs long term potentiation. Conversely, activation of Wnt signaling facilitates long term potentiation.

Suppression of Wnt signaling impairs long term potentiation. Conversely, activation of Wnt signaling facilitates long term potentiation. These findings suggest that Wnt signaling plays a critical role in regulating synaptic plasticity. Wnts are a family of secreted, lipid-modified signaling proteins that act as short range ligands to locally activate receptor-mediated signaling cascades. Wnt signaling is critical for a variety of developmental processes; its dysregulation is the causal factor for many diseases, especially cancer (1Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled receptors to activate intracellular signaling cascades, including the Wnt/β-catenin, Wnt/Ca2+, and Wnt/planar cell polarity pathways (3Behrens J. Kuhl M. Kuhl M. Wnt Signaling in Development. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2003: 1-14Google Scholar). In the canonical Wnt/β-catenin-signaling pathway, Frizzled receptors signal through Dishevelled to inhibit the kinase activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β in a protein degradation complex containing Axin, β-catenin, and other proteins. When Wnt signaling is inactive, β-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β and thus rapidly degraded via the proteosome pathway; the activation of Wnt signaling stabilizes β-catenin by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nuclei and binds the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors to regulate the expression of Wnt target genes (1Logan C.Y. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Collectively, available data point to the role of Wnt signaling in the modulation of brain functions. However, the mechanism by which Wnt signaling regulates brain function is completely unknown. Here we report the synaptic localization of Wnt signaling proteins in mouse hippocampal neurons, the activity-induced Wnt3a release from synapses, activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in post-synaptic neurons, and the regulatory role of Wnt signaling in long term potentiation (LTP). 2The abbreviations used are: LTP, long term potentiation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; APV, 2 amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid; DG, dentate gyrus; ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; fEPSP, field-excitatory postsynaptic potential. Our results suggest a novel role of Wnt signaling in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, which may provide a cellular mechanism for Wnt signaling in modulating brain functions. Indirect Fluorescence Immunostaining—Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS on ice for 2 h and sectioned (28 μm) with Vibratome 3000 (Vibratome, St. Louis, MO). The sections were permeabilized in 0.7% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution (0.05% Triton X-100, 5% normal goat serum in PBS) at 4 °C overnight and then in fluorescent secondary antibodies in blocking solution at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing in PBS, the sections were mounted with 90% glycerol in PBS for imaging. All images were acquired with LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss). Imaging parameters were set to avoid signal saturations. Signal quantifications were performed with NIH ImageJ. The antibodies used were anti-Wnt3a antibodies (R&D Systems; 10 μg/ml), anti-Frizzled-4 antibodies (R&D Systems; 5 μg/ml), anti-Dishevelled-3 antibodies (Chemicon; 1:200), anti-β-catenin antibodies (BD Biosciences; 1:50), anti-PSD-95 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology; 2 μg/ml), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-(1:100) and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Purified nonspecific IgG proteins were used as negative controls for individual antibodies. Electrophysiology—Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared from 3-4-week mice in cold oxygenated ACSF (119 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 26.2 mm NaHCO3, and 11.0 mm d-glucose) and recovered in oxygenated ACSF at room temperature before electrophysiological recording. During the recovering phase for experiments to investigate the potential role of Wnt signaling in LTP, slices were treated with Frizzled-8-Fc (5 μg/ml) for 1 h, anti-wnt3a antibodies (1 μg/ml) for 2 h, or Wnt3a (200 ng/ml) for 1 h. Protein-treated slices were then transferred to the recording chamber to induce LTP. LiCl2 (10 mm) was added in ACSF in a recording chamber 1 h before recording and was present during the course of recording. Electrophysiological recording was carried out at 27 °C. Field potentials were evoked in a molecular layer of dentate gyrus with concentric bipolar electrodes and recorded with a glass micropipette filled with 2 m NaCl. LTP was induced by tetanus (four times for 1 s at 100 Hz with intertrain intervals of 30 s) and measured by the slope of fEPSP at its rising phase. Wnt Signaling in the Mouse Hippocampus—In an attempt to identify novel molecular pathways underlying LTP, we used a DNA microarray approach to characterize genes that are regulated by LTP induction and found that mRNA levels of multiple genes encoding Wnt signaling proteins were significantly changed by LTP-inducing tetanic stimulations in the dentate gyrus (DG) slices of mice (supplemental Fig. 1). 3C. S. Park and S.-J. Tang, submitted for publication. This observation indicated that Wnt signaling is modulated by synaptic activity. Therefore, we performed fluorescent immunostaining experiments to determine the distribution pattern of Wnt signaling proteins, including Wnt3a, Frizzled-4, β-catenin, and Dishevelled-3. All of these proteins were detected in the hippocampal formation, including CA1-CA3 fields and DG (Fig. 1, a, e, i, and m). No signals were detected in negative controls with purified nonspecific IgG at the same concentrations (Fig. 1, a, e, i, and m). To investigate whether these proteins are at synapses, we performed double labeling experiments, with PSD-95 as a synaptic marker. The results showed that all four proteins displayed a punctate pattern in the molecular layer of DG (Fig. 1, b, f, j, and n). Similar patterns were observed in the stratum radiatum of CA1 regions (data not shown). Puncta of Wnt3a and Frizzled-4 signals showed extensive co-localizations with PSD-95 (Fig. 1, b-d and f-h), indicating their localization at the synaptic regions. As Frizzled-4 physically interacts with PSD-95 (39Hering H. Sheng M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 521: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), this Wnt receptor is most likely localized on the post-synaptic membrane. Dishevelled-3 puncta overlapped with PSD-95 to a lesser extent (Fig. 1, j-l), whereas β-catenin displayed a more diffused pattern with signal clusters (Fig. 1, n-p), which is consistent with previous studies (40Bamji S.X. Shimazu K. Kimes N. Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Lu B. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 2003; 40: 719-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Wnt signaling operates at hippocampal synapses. Tetanic Stimulations Induce Wnt3a Release from Synapses—If Wnt signaling indeed functions at synapses, we might expect that Wnt release from synapses is regulated by synaptic activity. To test this idea, we investigated whether LTP-inducing synaptic stimulations decreased the amount of Wnt3a at synapses. In these experiments, an incision was introduced in the DG molecular layer perpendicular to the DG cell body layer to separate the molecular layer into two portions (Fig. 2a). One side received electric stimulation, whereas the other side received no stimulation and served as an internal control. Slices were fixed immediately after stimulation for fluorescence immunostaining of Wnt3a. Signal intensity, number, and size of Wnt3a puncta, which are co-localized with PSD-95 (Fig. 1, a-d), as well as staining areas occupied by Wnt3a signals were measured using NIH ImageJ. Compared with the non-stimulated control region, test stimulations (1 stimulation/30 s) did not significantly change the pattern and intensity of Wnt3a signals (Fig. 2, b, e, and h). Quantitative analyses indicated that test stimulation did not change the mean staining area, number, and size of Wnt3a puncta (the ratio between stimulated and control sides for these measurements were 0.98 ± 0.08, 0.96 ± 0.03, and 0.99 ± 0.06, respectively) (Fig. 2, k-m). These observations indicated that the amount of Wnt3a at synapses was not changed by test stimulations. In contrast, tetanic stimulations (four times for 1 s at 100 Hz) dramatically decreased Wnt3a signals in the DG molecular layer (Fig. 2, c and f). An obvious shift of Wnt3a signals to lower intensity was observed after tetanic stimulations (Fig. 2i). Tetanic stimulations also caused significant decreases of stimulated/non-stimulated ratios of the staining area (0.52 ± 0.06) and decreases of the number (0.74 ± 0.04) and the size (0.67 ± 0.05) of Wnt3a puncta (Fig. 2, k-m). These results strongly suggest that LTP-inducing tetanic stimulations led to a decrease of Wnt3a amount at synapses. Because the decrease of Wnt3a was observed immediately after tetanus, they were most likely due to the release of Wnt3a rather than other more time-consuming processes such as protein degradation. To investigate the regulatory mechanism underlying activity-induced Wnt3A release from synapses, we determined the role of NMDA receptors. Applications of 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) blocked tetanus-induced decreases of Wnt3a signal intensity (Fig. 2, d, g, and j) and puncta number (0.99 ± 0.02) (Fig. 2l). This result indicates that the activation of NMDA receptors is necessary for synaptic activity-induced Wnt3a release. Furthermore, APV caused significant increase of staining areas (stimulated/non-stimulated ratio, 1.26 ± 0.09) and punctate size (1.25 ± 0.07) (Fig. 2, k and m). This observation suggests that inactivation of NMDA receptors leads to accumulation of Wnt3a at synapses. Tetanic Stimulations Cause Nuclear Accumulation of β-Catenin and Activation of Wnt Target Genes in Post-synaptic Neurons—Next, we tested the hypothesis that activity-induced Wnt release activates intracellular signaling pathways. We performed fluorescence immunostaining of β-catenin on hippocampal slices 15 or 30 min after tetanic stimulations at the perforant pathway and quantified fluorescence signals in the granule cell nucleus labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Fig. 3). Adjacent hippocampal slices that received test but not tetanic stimulations were used as controls. Quantification of nuclear β-catenin signals of randomly selected DG granule cells showed that tetanus significantly increased β-catenin signals in the nuclei at 15 and 30 min after stimulations (Fig. 3, a-d). These observations indicated tetanic stimulations activated the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We also found that APV completely abolished tetanus-induced nuclear accumulations of β-catenin (Fig. 3, e-h), indicating an essential role of NMDA receptors in tetanus-induced activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In support of the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling after tetanic stimulations, we observed, based on a DNA microarray analysis,3 that tetanus up-regulated mRNAs of several Wnt target genes (Fig. 3m); these Wnt target genes included Dll1 (41Galceran J.

Pathol. 1999; 154: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Collectively, results from the above experiments support the hypothesis that synaptic activities cause release of Wnts, which then bind to Frizzled receptors to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the post-synaptic neurons. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether blockade of released Wnts can abolish tetanus-induced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. To this end, we treated hippocampal slices with purified Frizzled-8-Fc (5 μg/ml), which is a Wnt scavenger (47Hsieh J.-C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The results showed that Frizzled-8-Fc treatment abolished tetanus-induced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (Fig. 3, i-l). In addition, at 15 min after tetanic stimulations, the nuclear β-catenin was significantly lower than that of the control (Fig. 3l), indicating an inhibitory effect of Frizzled-8-Fc on basal Wnt activities. Together, these observations support the idea that tetanus-induced accumulation of nuclear β-catenin depends on Wnts released after synaptic activation. Suppression of Wnt Signaling Impairs LTP—Because LTP-inducing tetanus activates Wnt signaling (Fig. 3), we hypothesized that Wnt signaling plays a role in LTP. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of Frizzled-8-Fc (which was able to block the tetanus-induced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (Fig. 3)) on LTP. Mouse hippocampal slices were incubated with Frizzled-8-Fc (5 μg/ml in ACSF) for 1 h before recording to ensure penetrations of the recombinant protein into the slice. Slices treated with boiled Frizzled-8-Fc were used as controls. LTP was induced at the perforant pathway by tetanic stimulations. We observed that Frizzled-8-Fc treatments decreased LTP magnitude, especially during the late phase of LTP (Fig. 4a). For instance, although Frizzled-8-Fc did not affect LTP at 60 min, it significantly decreased the amplitude of LTP at 180 min (mean % of base line: control, 147.5 ± 9.6%; Frizzled-8-Fc, 117.8 ± 3.0%; p < 0.05) (Fig. 4b). Because Frizzled-8-Fc may affect LTP by scavenging multiple Wnts (Fig. 4, a and b), we next investigated the role of Wnt3a, which was found at the synaptic region and released in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner (Fig. 1, a-d; Fig. 2). To specifically antagonize Wnt3a, hippocampal slices were incubated for 2 h before LTP induction with anti-Wnt3a antibodies, which is known to neutralize Wnt3a activities in vitro (R & D Systems). Compared with purified nonspecific IgG controls, anti-Wnt3a antibodies (1 μg/ml) significantly impaired LTP (Fig. 4, c and d). This result indicated that Wnt3A alone exerted a discernible effect on LTP. Both Frizzled-8-Fc and anti-Wnt3a antibodies did not change input/output curves, suggesting normal basal synaptic transmissions (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that Wnt signaling is important for LTP. Activation of Wnt Signaling Potentiates LTP—To rigorously determine the involvement of Wnt signaling in LTP, we next investigated the effect of Wnt signaling activation on LTP. In the initial experiment, we focused on the effect of lithium, which has been widely used to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3β (11Hall A.C. Lucas F.R. Salinas P.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 48Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). We found that applications of LiCl2 (10 mm) in ACSF during electrophysiological recording enhanced LTP (mean % of base line at 60 min: control, 167.4 ± .9%; LiCl2, 188.2 ± 5.1%; p < 0.05; at 180 min: control, 116.8 ± 5.7%; LiCl2, 157.1 ± 9.5%; p < 0.01) (Fig. 5, a and b). Because our earlier experiments indicated that synaptic activities led to release of Wnt3a from the synaptic region (Fig. 2), we examined the effect of purified recombinant Wnt3a on LTP. We found that, compared with control treatments without Wnt3A, pre-incubation of hippocampal slices with Wnt3a (200 ng/ml) potentiated LTP (Fig. 5c). For example, LTP magnitudes at 60 min for control and Wnt3a-treated experimental slices were 143.3 ± 4.6 and 160.5 ± 4.4%, respectively (p < 0.05). At 180 min, they were 123.1 ± 4.3 and 145.2 ± 4.4% (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5d). LiCl2 and Wnt3a did not affect basal synaptic transmissions, as suggested by normal input/output curves (data not shown). Because both lithium and Wnt3a modulate β-catenin, these results suggest that activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway facilitates LTP expression. In summary, we have shown (i) Wnt signaling proteins were present at hippocampal synapses, (ii) synaptic activities caused release of Wnt3a from synapses in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner, (iii) tetanus-induced Wnt release activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and (iv) inhibition of Wnt signaling impairs LTP, whereas activation of Wnt signaling potentiates LTP. These findings reveal a synaptic function of Wnt signaling in regulation of LTP. Although much has been learned about the intracellular pathways that transduce Wnt signals, little is known about the mechanisms that control when and where to activate Wnt signaling. Our findings of the activity-dependent synaptic release of Wnt3a illustrate an elegant mechanism to control the spatial and temporal activities of Wnt signaling. Based on the results described above, we propose the following process for the activation of Wnt signaling at synapse: (i) synaptic activation of NMDA receptors, (ii) activation of NMDA receptors, likely via Ca2+ signals, triggering Wnt release from the synapse, and (iii) synaptically released Wnts binding to the extracellular domain of local Frizzled receptors on synaptic membranes to activate Wnt signaling cascades. Our studies uncovered a novel role of Wnt signals in LTP regulation. Because LTP-like processes are important for information storage (49Grimwood P.D. Martin S.J. Morris R.G.M. Cowan W.M. Sudhof T.C. Stevens C.F. Synases. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore2001: 519-570Google Scholar), Wnt signaling evoked by NMDA receptor activation is likely involved in memory formation in the brain. Consistently, mutations of Derailed, a Drosophila Wnt receptor (13Yoshikawa S. McKinnon R.D. Kokel M. Thomas J.B. Nature. 2003; 422: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), cause memory deficits in Drosophila (37Dura J.M. Preat T. Tully T. J.

Recent studies suggest that aberrant Wnt signaling is implicated in multiple abnormal brain conditions, including Alzheimer disease (34De Ferrari G.V. Chacon M.A. Barria M.I. Garrido J.L. Godoy J.A.

Synapse. 2005; 56: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our findings of the role of Wnt signaling in synaptic plasticity provide a new perspective for understanding the etiologic mechanism for these mental disorders. We propose two potential mechanisms for Wnt/β-catenin signaling to regulate LTP. One is that the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling may activate LEF/TCF target genes that are important for LTP. Indeed, we observed NMDA receptor- and Wnt-dependent nuclear accumulation of β-catenin after tetanic stimulations (Fig. 3). A recent study has postulated that the Caenorhabditis elegans β-catenin homolog BAR-1 may regulate the abundance of post-synaptic glutamate receptor GLR-1 via control of the transcription of Wnt target genes (53Dreier L. Burbea M. Kaplan J.M. Neuron. 2005; 46: 51-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling may directly modulate the structure and function of the synapse via synaptic β-catenin. At synapses, β-catenin mediates the interaction between cadherins and actin cytoskeletons and thereby regulates the function of cadherin-containing adhesion complexes during synapse formation, synaptic structure maintenance, and remodeling (54Goda Y. Neuron. 2002; 35: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 55Togashi H. Abe K. Mizoguchi A. Takaoka K. Chisaka O. Takeichi M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 77-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LTP expression is accompanied with synaptic growth and remodeling (56Yuste R. Bonhoeffer T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1071-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 57Matus A. Science. 2000; 290: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 58Matsuzaki M. Honkura N. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H. Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). It would be important for future studies to examine whether the synaptic Wnt signaling is coupled to LTP-associated synaptic growth. β-catenin may also regulate synaptic function by interacting with other proteins. For example, Bamji et al. (40Bamji S.X. Shimazu K. Kimes N. Huelsken J. Birchmeier W. Lu B. Reichardt L.F. Neuron. 2003; 40: 719-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) shows that the interactions between β-catenin and PDZ proteins play an important role in regulating synaptic vesicle localization and presynaptic assembly. Consistent with the idea that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling may function locally to modulate the structure and function of synapses, neural activities redistribute β-catenin into spines (59Murase S. Mosser E. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 91-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The two potential mechanisms outlined above are not mutually excluded. It is possible that the local synaptic Wnt/β-catenin signaling mediates rapid structural and functional changes of the synapse, whereas the transcriptional Wnt/β-catenin signaling has a slower but long lasting effect on synaptic plasticity.

Here, we report that Rabex-5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5, binds to Ub through two independent UBDs. These UBDs determine a number of properties of Rabex-5, including its coupled monoubiquitination and interaction in vivo with ubiquitinated EGFRs. Structural and biochemical characterization of the UBDs of Rabex-5 revealed that one of them (MIU, motif interacting with ubiquitin) binds to Ub with modes superimposable to those of the UIM (ubiquitin-interacting motif):Ub interaction, although in the opposite orientation. The other UBD, RUZ (Rabex-5 ubiquitin binding zinc finger) binds to a surface of Ub centered on Asp58Ub and distinct from the “canonical” Ile44Ub-based surface. The two binding surfaces allow Ub to interact simultaneously with different UBDs, thus opening new perspectives in Ub-mediated signaling.

Here, we report that Rabex-5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5, binds to Ub through two independent UBDs.

The two binding surfaces allow Ub to interact simultaneously with different UBDs, thus opening new perspectives in Ub-mediated signaling. Ubiquitination regulates protein stability and function, with impact on numerous cellular phenotypes. One paramount function of ubiquitin (Ub) is to determine proteolysis of intracellular proteins. In this process, a Ub chain, composed of at least four Ub branching from K48, is appended to target proteins that are then delivered to the proteasome for degradation (Pickart, 2001Pickart C.M. Ubiquitin enters the new millennium.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Nonproteolytic functions of Ub rely on monomeric Ub or poly-Ub chains branched from lysines other than K48. In this case, ubiquitination affects the structure, the activity, or the localization of the target protein, thereby regulating processes, such as DNA repair (Sun and Chen, 2004Sun L. Chen Z.J. The novel functions of ubiquitination in signaling.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), NF-kB-mediated transcription (Chen, 2005Chen Z.J. Ubiquitin signalling in the NF-kappaB pathway.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), and endocytosis and trafficking (Hicke and Dunn, 2003Hicke L. Dunn R. Regulation of membrane protein transport by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-binding proteins.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The functions of Ub largely depend on its protein-interaction ability. Many proteins (Ub receptors) harbor Ub binding domains/motifs (UBD), which interact with mono- and/or polyubiquitin chains (Hicke et al., 2005Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Thus, ubiquitinated proteins and Ub receptors constitute a signaling network within the cell. Some UBDs (CUE, UIM, GAT) can also sustain a process, termed coupled monoubiquitination, whereby a Ub receptor becomes itself monoubiquitinated, through mechanisms that are still largely obscure (see Hicke et al., 2005Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar for proposed models). To date, eleven families of UBDs have been identified (Bienko et al., 2005Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M.

For six of them, the three-dimensional structure of at least one member has been solved, either alone or in complex with Ub. Three UBDs, CUE, UBA, and GAT, although unrelated at sequence level, display similar structural features, as they fold into a three helix bundle with two helices contacting Ub (Kang et al., 2003Kang R.S.

USA. 2005; 102: 2334-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The UIM is a single α helix that packs against Ub (Fisher et al., 2003Fisher R.D. Wang B. Alam S.L. Higginson D.S. Robinson H. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Structure and ubiquitin binding of the ubiquitin-interacting motif.J. Biol.

Alam S.L. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I.

Finally, the NZF is a zinc finger domain that contacts Ub through residues intercalating the cysteines that coordinate the metal atom (Alam et al., 2004Alam S.L. Sun J. Payne M. Welch B.D. Blake B.K. Davis D.R. Meyer H.H. Emr S.D. Sundquist W.I. Ubiquitin interactions of NZF zinc fingers.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2003Wang B. Alam S.L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20225-20234Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Despite these structural differences and their likely unrelated evolutionary origins, UBDs show remarkable convergence in the mode of interaction with Ub, which is determined by contacts between a hydrophobic surface on the UBD and a hydrophobic pocket centered on Ile44 on Ub. In almost all characterized cases, Ile44 contacts an extremely conserved residue that is specific for each type of UBD (Hicke et al., 2005Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Variations on this theme are known. In the case of UBM, a recently described UBD, the binding to the “classical” hydrophobic patch on Ub is displaced toward Leu8 and apparently does not involve Ile44 (Bienko et al., 2005Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. et al.Ubiquitin-binding domains in Y-family polymerases regulate translesion synthesis.Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). These findings explain why the Ile44 “face” of Ub has been totally conserved from yeast to mammals. The extreme conservation of Ub, however, extends to the entire molecule, suggesting that other portions of its surface might be involved in interactions. The S. cerevisiae protein Vps9p is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that regulates the activity of the Rab-like GTPase Vps21 (Hama et al., 1999Hama H. Tall G.G. Horazdovsky B.F. Vps9p is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in vesicle-mediated vacuolar protein transport.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15284-15291Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Its mammalian ortholog, Rabex-5, regulates the activity of the Rab5 GTPase (Horiuchi et al., 1997Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M.

Moreover, the CUE domain of Vps9 appears to inhibit in cis its GEF activity (Donaldson et al., 2003Donaldson K.M. Yin H. Gekakis N. Supek F. Joazeiro C.A.

Mammalian Rabex-5 displays a region of limited sequence similarity with the CUE of yeast Vps9p (Donaldson et al., 2003Donaldson K.M. Yin H. Gekakis N. Supek F. Joazeiro C.A.

Thus, while models for Ub-mediated regulation of Vps9p activity can be put forward (Davies et al., 2003Davies B.A. Topp J.D. Sfeir A.J. Katzmann D.J. Carney D.S. Tall G.G. Friedberg A.S. Deng L.

A ubiquitin-binding motif required for intramolecular monoubiquitylation, the CUE domain.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether Rabex-5 is subjected to the same kind of regulation. The present studies were undertaken to shed light on the Ub binding abilities of Rabex-5 and their regulatory role. Rabex-5 displays from N to C terminus (Figure 1A) a zinc finger module, belonging to the ZnF_A20 family (Opipari et al., 1990Opipari Jr., A.W. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. The A20 cDNA induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha encodes a novel type of zinc finger protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14705-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); a Vps9 domain, which encodes for the Rab5-GEF catalytic activity; and a putative CUE domain. Using a panel of deletion mutants in in vitro pull-down experiments, we found that Rabex-5 binds to Ub through two independent regions, while its putative CUE is not a UBD (Figure 1A and see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The first Ub binding region (aa 2–49) corresponds to the ZnF_A20 domain. Thus, a third type of zinc finger domain is able to bind to Ub, besides the NZF and the PAZ domains (Hicke et al., 2005Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar and references within). Henceforth, we refer to this domain as RUZ domain (Rabex-5 ubiquitin binding zinc finger). The second region interacting with Ub (aa 48–74) is adjacent to the RUZ and does not contain any evident sequence similarity with known domains. The region from aa 48 to 74 of Rabex-5 is well conserved in vertebrates (Figures 1B and S2; Table S1). Secondary structure prediction highlights a putative amphipathic α helix from aa 51 to 70, wherein a signature can be identified (D-ϕ-x-LA-x-x-L-x-x-E-E) that resembles the signature of a UIM (Hofmann and Falquet, 2001Hofmann K.

STKE. 2003; 2003: re17PubMed Google Scholar) in a reversed primary sequence orientation (Figure 1B). This suggested that this region of Rabex-5 represents a novel UBD. Within the 48–74 region, Ala58 lays in a position (Figure 1B) similar to that occupied in UIMs by an Ala residue critical for Ub binding (Swanson et al., 2003Swanson K.A. Kang R.S. Stamenova S.D. Hicke L. Radhakrishnan I. Solution structure of Vps27 UIM-ubiquitin complex important for endosomal sorting and receptor downregulation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4597-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of this residue to Gly, in full-length (FL) Rabex-5, reduced binding to Ub (Figure 1C). In addition, the RUZ-less 48–491 mutant, bearing the additional A58G mutation, showed no detectable Ub binding (Figure 1C). Thus, the 48–74 region of Rabex-5 corresponds to a UBD, which we named MIU (motif interacting with Ub). We searched for other MIU-containing proteins, and found 73 putative MIUs in 62 proteins from all species (Figure S3; Table S2). Prompted by these findings, we tested three putative MIUs from Myosin VI and RNF168 and found that they all bind to polyUb chains linked by K48 or K63 (Figure 1D, left and right panels, respectively). Mutation of the critical Ala to Gly strongly reduced the binding of all tested MIUs (Figure 1D). Interestingly, binding to K48- or K63-linked chains was differently affected by the mutations (Figure 1D). Whether this reflects selective preferences of various MIUs for different Ub chains, as shown for other UBDs (Raasi et al., 2004Raasi S. Orlov I. Fleming K.G. Pickart C.M. Binding of polyubiquitin chains to ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains of HHR23A.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Varadan et al., 2004Varadan R. Assfalg M. Haririnia A. Raasi S. Pickart C. Fushman D. Solution conformation of Lys63-linked di-ubiquitin chain provides clues to functional diversity of polyubiquitin signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7055-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), remains to be established. A characteristic of some UBD-containing proteins is to undergo monoubiquitination in a process that depends on the integrity of the UBD itself, named coupled monoubiquitination (Hicke et al., 2005Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Ubiquitin-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). To check whether the UBDs of Rabex-5 can sustain this process, we coexpressed FLAG-tagged Rabex-5, together with HA-tagged Ub, and found that Rabex-5 is indeed monoubiquitinated in vivo (Figure 1E). Next, we tested mutants displaying either a mutation in the MIU (Rabex-5-A58G), the deletion of the RUZ (48–491), or the double mutation (48–491-A58G). The deletion of RUZ did not significantly affect the ability of Rabex-5 to undergo monoubiquitination. Conversely, the A58G mutation severely reduced monoubiquitination of the FL protein or of the RUZ-deleted mutant (Figure 1E). Thus, the MIU sustains coupled monoubiquitination of Rabex-5. We searched for physiological partners of the UBDs of Rabex-5. As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, both FLAG-tagged Rabex-5 and endogenous Rabex-5 could coimmunoprecipitate endogenous EGFR, in a ligand-dependent fashion. In addition, GFP-tagged Rabex-5 was recruited to the plasma membrane upon EGF treatment and remained colocalized with EGFR at several stations of the endocytic pathway (Figures 2C and S4). Rabex-5 preferentially associated with high-molecular weight forms of EGFR, probably representing the ubiquitinated receptor (Figure 2D). To verify this possibility, we overexpressed, in HeLa cells, either Cbl—the E3 ligase that ubiquitinates EGFR—or its dominant-negative version 70Z-Cbl, that markedly reduces ubiquitination of the receptor (Yokouchi et al., 1999Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. Ligand-induced ubiquitination of the epidermal growth factor receptor involves the interaction of the c-Cbl RING finger and UbcH7.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Cbl significantly increased the Rabex-5:EGFR interaction, while the presence of 70Z-Cbl severely reduced it (Figure 2E). Finally, we tested the impact of the Rabex-5 UBDs on the interaction. The double mutant, Rabex-5 48–491 A58G, did not show appreciable interaction with EGFR, whereas the presence of either a functional RUZ (Rabex-5 A58G) or a functional MIU (Rabex-5 48–491) was sufficient for binding to the EGFR (Figure 2F). We concluded that, in vivo, both the RUZ and the MIU are able to engage ubiquitinated EGFR. We determined the crystal structure of the RUZ-MIU fragment of Rabex-5 (aa 2–74, henceforth RUZ-MIU) in complex with Ub in two crystal forms. Form I is hexagonal and contains one molecule of RUZ-MIU and one molecule of Ub per asymmetric unit, while form II is triclinic with six copies of each molecule in the unit cell. Both structures were solved exploiting the anomalous signal from the Zn2+ ion and refined to 2.4 and 2.1 Å resolution (Table S3), respectively. Representative electron density maps are shown in Figures 4D and 5B. In both structures, all molecules of RUZ-MIU assume similar conformations. The ordered part of the elongated molecule begins at residue Leu17Rbx and folds, as predicted for the A20-type zinc fingers (Wertz et al., 2004Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. et al.De-ubiquitination and ubiquitin ligase domains of A20 downregulate NF-kappaB signalling.Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar), into a treble clef motif (Krishna et al., 2003Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Structural classification of zinc fingers: survey and summary.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This is followed by a helix that harbors the second Ub binding site (Figure 3A). Within each RUZ-MIU molecule, the RUZ and MIU domains contact two different molecules of Ub (Figure 3A); conversely, every molecule of Ub contacts two molecules of RUZ-MIU again using two disjoint surfaces (Figure 3A). Comparison of the conformation of the seven crystallographically independent copies of RUZ-MIU identified two regions, corresponding to the RUZ (residues Leu18Rbx to Trp39Rbx) and the MIU plus some flanking residues (residues Arg40Rbx to Glu64Rbx), which are separated by a flexible hinge (Figure 3B). Superposition of the different copies of the individual regions yields rmsds (root-mean-square deviations) between 0.2 and 0.3 Å for Cα atoms, indicating that the conformations are, given the coordinate uncertainties of the structures (Table S3), identical within error. RUZ-MIU can thus be considered as consisting of two rigid domains that are joined together between residues Trp39Rbx and Arg40Rbx. The relative orientation of the two domains is dictated by crystal packing forces, whereby steric considerations preclude the simultaneous binding of a RUZ and a MIU domain of the same Rabex-5 molecule to one Ub molecule (Figure S5). Residues Leu17Rbx to Trp39Rbx represent a Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger domain of the A20-type. The first pair of cysteines (Cys19Rbx and Cys23Rbx) forms a zinc knuckle and the second pair of cysteines (Cys35Rbx and Cys39Rbx) is located on the N-terminal turn of the helix (Figure 4A). This arrangement of Zn ligands is characteristic of the treble clef zinc finger motif. However, other features of the treble clef motif, notably β hairpin structures before the first cysteine and in the loop between the second and the third cysteine, are absent in the structure of RUZ-MIU. Despite the lack of regular secondary structure elements, the region between Cys23Rbx and Cys39Rbx is structurally well defined due to the presence of an intricate network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Figure 4A). The RUZ is conserved in Rabex-5 from different vertebrates (Figure 4B). Characteristic elements such as a particular arrangement of glycines and prolines, needed for the compact fold of the RUZ, are conserved in zinc fingers present in nonvertebrates such as parasites and plants (Figure 4B). Some A20-type zinc fingers exhibit close similarity with the RUZ motif, while others, such as Hs_A20.6 (Figure 4B) share only a similar spacing between the cysteine residues. The RUZ contacts Ub in a region centered on Asp58Ub (Figure 4C). As shown in the representative electron density map (Figure 4D), the central residue in the binding interface is Ser36Rbx, which forms hydrogen bonds to both carboxylate oxygens of Asp58Ub with its amide nitrogen (2.9 Å) and its Oγ-atom (2.6 Å). Asp58Ub itself connects back to Tyr26Rbx-N via its carbonyl oxygen (3.0 Å). Further polar interactions are formed between Cys35Rbx-Sγ and Arg54Ub-NH2 (3.3 Å), between Tyr25Rbx-OH and Glu51Ub-Oɛ2 (2.8 Å), and between Asn28Rbx-N and Ser57Ub-Oγ (3.3 Å). The binding between the two molecules is further strengthened by stacking interactions between the side chains of Tyr25Rbx and Arg54Ub (Figure 4E). The second Ub binding site on RUZ-MIU is located on the helical part of the structure and encompasses residues from seven turns of the helix starting with Arg47Rbx and ending with Phe69Rbx. Overall, the binding mode resembles that of the complex between Vps27-UIM and Ub (Swanson et al., 2003Swanson K.A. Kang R.S. Stamenova S.D. Hicke L. Radhakrishnan I. Solution structure of Vps27 UIM-ubiquitin complex important for endosomal sorting and receptor downregulation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4597-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), with the striking difference that the helix binding to Ub is accommodated in the opposite direction, i.e., the C terminus of Ub is pointing in the direction of the C terminus of the UBD while in the Vps27-UIM:Ub complex the C terminus of Ub points toward the N terminus of the UBD Ub (Swanson et al., 2003Swanson K.A. Kang R.S. Stamenova S.D. Hicke L. Radhakrishnan I. Solution structure of Vps27 UIM-ubiquitin complex important for endosomal sorting and receptor downregulation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4597-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar; Figure 5A). As in the Vps27-UIM:Ub complex, at the center of the binding interface, Ala58Rbx (Ala266 Vps27-UIM) is inserting its methyl group into a hydrophobic depression built by Leu8Ub, Ile44Ub, His68Ub, and Val70Ub (Figure 5B). In UIMs another invariant amino acid is represented by a serine residue at position +4, with respect to the central alanine, which has been described to play an important role for the binding of the UIM of Vps27 and Hrs to Ub (Fisher et al., 2003Fisher R.D. Wang B. Alam S.L. Higginson D.S. Robinson H. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Structure and ubiquitin binding of the ubiquitin-interacting motif.J. Biol.

Solution structure of Vps27 UIM-ubiquitin complex important for endosomal sorting and receptor downregulation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4597-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the NMR structure of the Vps27-UIM:Ub complex, it was found that the hydroxyl oxygen of Ser270Vps27 is forming hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogens of Ala46Ub and/or Gly47Ub (Swanson et al., 2003Swanson K.A. Kang R.S. Stamenova S.D. Hicke L. Radhakrishnan I. Solution structure of Vps27 UIM-ubiquitin complex important for endosomal sorting and receptor downregulation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4597-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In Rabex-5, the position equivalent to Ser270Vps27 is occupied by Asp54Rbx whose carboxylate group is positioned such that both oxygens can simultaneously engage in separate hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogens of Ala46Ub and Gly47Ub (Figures 5C and 5D) leading to a tighter binding. Shih et al., 2002Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Epsins and Vps27p/Hrs contain ubiquitin-binding domains that function in receptor endocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar showed that mutation of Ser270 into Asp in Vps27 reduced 5- to 6-fold the Ub binding ability of the Vps27-UIM. An explanation for this apparent contradiction came by the superimposition of the structures (Figure 5D). The amide group of Gln50Rbx, which in the Rabex5-MIU:Ub complex fixates the Asp54Rbx-carboxylate in an optimal position via a salt bridge, is not present in Vps27-UIM:Ub complex, where Ser274Vps27 substitutes for Gln50Rbx. The third region of importance in both UIM and MIU binding is a group of glutamates C-terminal (MIU) or N-terminal (UIM) of the central Ala. In both motifs, one of the glutamates forms polar interactions with Arg42Ub and/or Arg72Ub. In the MIU-Ub complex, the carboxylate group of Glu65Rbx forms not only a salt bridge to Arg42Ub but also accepts a hydrogen bond from the amide nitrogen of Leu73Ub. The latter interaction, together with a hydrophobic interaction between Phe69Rbx and the side chain of Leu73Ub tacks the C terminus of Ub up to Leu73Ub to Rabex-5 (Figure 5C). N-terminal of Asp54Rbx, two more residues of Rabex-5 are involved in specific contacts to Ub and extend the binding surface. The amide moiety of Gln50Rbx donates a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Thr66Ub, and the guanidinium group of Arg47Rbx forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Lys63Ub (Figure 5C). Thus, in total, the resulting binding region for the MIU involves seven turns of the α helix. The structure of the RUZ-MIU:Ub complex reveals that the two UBDs are able to interact with distinct surfaces on Ub, centered on Asp58Ub and Ile44Ub, respectively. We tested two Ub mutants, Ub-I44A and Ub-D58A, for binding to Rabex-5. The I44A mutation strongly reduced the binding of Ub t"

https://openalex.org/W2074431774,"Disulfide bonds are important structural motifs that play an essential role in maintaining the conformational stability of many bioactive peptides. Of particular importance are the conotoxins, which selectively target a wide range of ion channels that are implicated in numerous disease states. Despite the enormous potential of conotoxins as therapeutics, their multiple disulfide bond frameworks are inherently unstable under reducing conditions. Reduction or scrambling by thiol-containing molecules such as glutathione or serum albumin in intracellular or extracellular environments such as blood plasma can decrease their effectiveness as drugs. To address this issue, we describe a new class of selenoconotoxins where cysteine residues are replaced by selenocysteine to form isosteric and nonreducible diselenide bonds. Three isoforms of α-conotoxin ImI were synthesized by <i>t</i>-butoxycarbonyl chemistry with systematic replacement of one ([Sec<sup>2,8</sup>]ImI or [Sec<sup>3,12</sup>]ImI), or both ([Sec<sup>2,3,8,12</sup>]ImI) disulfide bonds with a diselenide bond. Each analogue demonstrated remarkable stability to reduction or scrambling under a range of chemical and biological reducing conditions. Three-dimensional structural characterization by NMR and CD spectroscopy indicates conformational preferences that are very similar to those of native ImI, suggesting fully isomorphic structures. Additionally, full bioactivity was retained at the α<sub>7</sub> nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, with each selenoanalogue exhibiting a dose-response curve that overlaps with wild-type ImI, thus further supporting an isomorphic structure. These results demonstrate that selenoconotoxins can be used as highly stable scaffolds for the design of new drugs."

It has been reported that apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) binds to ABCA1 and cellular free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipids (PL) are loaded onto apoA-I to form pre-β HDL. It is clear that ABCA1 is involved in phosphatidylcholine (PC)-rich HDL generation in plasma, because plasma PL concentration of Abca1–/– mice was decreased by more than 75%, mostly due to a reduction of PC in HDL (1Francone O.L.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8569-8578Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); however, the molecular mechanism behind ABCA1-mediated pre-βHDL formation is still poorly understood. Several models have been proposed for the mechanism of ABCA1-mediated pre-β HDL formation: (a) a two-step process model proposed by Fielding et al. (2Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and Wang et al. (3Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

This model is based on two types of experiments: (i) vanadate, glibenclamide, and cyclodextrin show differential inhibitory effects upon PL and FC efflux to apoA-I, and (ii) medium containing apoA-I conditioned on smooth muscle cells leads to FC efflux from vascular endothelial cells that do not express ABCA1. (b) A concurrent process model: FC and PL efflux by ABCA1 to apoA-I are tightly coupled to each other (4Smith J.D. Le Goff W. Settle M. Brubaker G. Waelde C. Horwitz A. Oda M.N. J.

Human ABCA7, which has the highest homology (66.1%) to ABCA1, mediates the apoA-I-dependent efflux of phospholipids and cholesterol as ABCA1 (14Abe-Dohmae S. Ikeda Y. Matsuo M. Hayashi M. Okuhira K. Ueda K. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 604-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); however, human ABCA7 mediates cholesterol release with much less efficiency than ABCA1 (15Hayashi M.

Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1703-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that phospholipids but not cholesterol are loaded onto apoA-I by mouse ABCA7 (16Wang N. Lan D. Gerbod-Giannone M. Linsel-Nitschke P. Jehle A.W. Chen W. Martinez L.O. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42906-42912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These results may not be explained by the two-step process model and suggest that ABCA1 and ABCA7 have different substrate specificities for transport and that cholesterol is one of the transport substrates for ABCA1. To explore the mechanism of ABCA1-mediated pre-β HDL formation, we purified human ABCA1 as a detergent-soluble form and examined ATPase activity. Purified ABCA1 showed robust ATPase activity when reconstituted in liposomes made of synthetic PC, and the ATPase activity was inhibited by glibenclamide but not by vanadate. ABCA1 ATPase was reduced by the addition of cholesterol. Materials—Bovine serum albumin, leupeptin, aprotinin, trypsin, glibenclamide, stigmasterol, campesterol, and Na2ATP were purchased from Sigma. Baculovirus transfer vector (pVL1392) and baculovirus (Baculogold™) were obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-penta-His antibody was obtained from Qiagen. l-α-Lecitin (20%) from soybean and sphingomyelin from egg yolk were obtained from Sigma.

The modified ABCA1 cDNA (designated ABCA1-TATH) was inserted into the transfer vector pVL1392. To construct the NBF1 Walker A lysine mutant, ABCA1 K939M, DNA fragments containing a K939M missense mutation were generated by a two-step PCR method with two pairs of primers, 5′-GGGCCACAATGGAGCGGGGATGACGACCAC-3′ and 5′-CTGTCCCCCAGGACGTCCGCTTCATCCATG-3′ and 5′-GTGGTCGTCATCCCCGCTCCATTGTGGCCC-3′ and 5′-CTCAGTGGCTGTGATCATCAAGGGCATCG-3′. NBF2 Walker A lysine-1952 was substituted with methionine using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with a mutagenic primer, 5′-GGGGCTGGAATGTCATCAACTTTC-3′. The hMDR1 expression vector and recombinant virus were generated as described previously (6Kimura Y. Matsuo M. Takahashi K. Saeki T. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Generation of Recombinant Baculovirus—Recombinant baculovirus containing ABCA1-TATH (BV-ABCA1-TATH) was generated by the co-transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells with pVL1392-ABCA1-TATH and Baculogold™ DNA. BV-ABCA1-TATH was purified and amplified following the manufacturer's directions. The generated virus was kept at 4 °C in the dark. Expression of Human ABCA1 in Sf9 Cells—Sf9 cells were grown at 27 °C as a monolayer culture in Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum or as a suspension culture in Grace's insect medium with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 0.1% purulonic F-68 (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells were infected with BV-hABCA1-TATH at a multiplicity of infection of 5. At 48 h after infection, cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were stored at –80 °C. Preparation of Microsomal Membrane—All the steps in the preparation of the microsomal membrane fraction were performed at 0–4 °C. Sf9 cells were thawed and resuspended in 10×cell volume of sonication buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (100 μg/ml (p-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell suspension was sonicated for 5 min (output 5, 10 rounds of sonication for 30 s + interval of 2 min) with a probe tip-type sonicator (Misonix Inc.) and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 60 min. The microsome pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mix. The microsomal membrane suspension was passed through a 22-gauge syringe five times and stored at –80 °C. Micorosomal membrane protein (80–100 mg) was obtained from 10 g of wet cells. Glycosylation Analysis—The reaction of N-glycosidase F (NGF) was performed as described previously (18Tanaka A.R. Ikeda Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Sadanami K. Kidera A. Nakagawa S. Nagase T. Aoki R. Kioka N. Amachi T. Yokoyama S. Ueda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Lectin staining was performed as follows: After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was first blocked with block ACE (Dainihon Pharmaceutical) and incubated with 1 μg/ml of concanavalin A (Honen Corp.) in buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.05% Tween 20. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was then washed three times, and signals were detected with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Extraction of ABCA1 from Sf9 Membrane—The microsomal membrane was resuspended with buffer A containing 0.6 or 0.8% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) (Dojindo) and protease inhibitor mix and kept on ice with occasional gentle mixing for 30 min. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min) in a TLA 100.4 rotor (Beckman). Purification with Ni2+-NTA-Agarose—All purification steps were performed at 0– 4 °C. Extracted proteins were applied to Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The mixture was rotated for 18 h. The resin was then washed with 20× bed volume of buffer A containing 0.1% DDM and 20 mm imidazole. ABCA1 or MDR1 was eluted with 2× bed volume of buffer A containing 0.1% DDM and 200 mm imidazole. The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a microcon YM-100 (Millipore) to 0.1– 0.3 mg/ml protein. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Purification with Anion Exchange Chromatography Sepharose, DE52— Proteins were mixed with pre-equilibrated DE52 Sepharose (Whatman) in DE52 binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 30%(v/v) glycerol, 0.1% DDM, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and the mixture was rotated for 12 h. ABCA1 was eluted with DE52 binding buffer containing NaCl (50∼200 mm) for 60 min. The flow-through fraction and eluate were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a microcon YM-100 to 0.1– 0.2 mg/ml protein. Cell Culture and Membrane Preparation—WI-38 human fibroblast cells and HEK293 stably expressing human ABCA1, generated by hygromycin selection as described previously (17Munehira Y. Ohnishi T. Kawamoto S. Furuya A. Shitara K. Imamura M. Yokota T. Takeda S. Amachi T. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15091-15095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. WI-38 cells were seeded into a 100-mm dish at 5 × 106 cells. To induce ABCA1 expression, cells were cultured in the medium containing 10 μm TO901317 and 5 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 24 h. Crude membranes were prepared by nitrogen cavitation method as described previously (18Tanaka A.R. Ikeda Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Sadanami K. Kidera A. Nakagawa S. Nagase T. Aoki R. Kioka N. Amachi T. Yokoyama S. Ueda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Purified ABCA1 with Lipids—l-α-Lecitin (20%) from soybean, sphingomyelin, or synthesized phospholipids dissolved in chloroform were dried by evaporation and resuspended in reaction buffer, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. When sterols were incorporated into the liposomes, sterols were mixed with phospholipids in chloroform at first, then dried by evaporation and resuspended in reaction buffer according to the standard procedure (20Rujanavech C. Silbert D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7215-7219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The suspension was sonicated in a bath sonicator. To examine the effect of apoA-I, apoA-I (500 ng) was added to the suspension either before or after sonication. The lipid stock was stored at 4 °C under N2 gas and kept in a dark place. Purified protein (100 ng) was mixed with 500 ng of lipid, and the mixture was incubated at 23 °C for 20 min. The reconstitution buffer for MDR1 contained 2 mm dithiothreitol. Assay of ATPase Activity—Reactions were carried out in 16 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na2ATP (pH 7.0), and 10 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of purified reconstituted ABCA1 (100 ng) and stopped by the addition of 14 μl of 12% SDS and vigorous mixing. ATPase activity was analyzed using two methods: (i) measuring released ADP by high performance liquid chromatography with titanium dioxide (21Kimura Y. Shibasaki S. Morisato K. Ishizuka N. Minakuchi H. Nakanishi K. Matsuo M. Amachi T. Ueda M. Ueda K. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 326: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and (ii) measuring released Pi by the Pi-Mo method (22Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 23Drueckes P. Schinzel R. Palm D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Pi released by the reaction with reconstituted ABCA1, predenatured by SDS, was subtracted as a negative control. Little or no ATP hydrolysis was observed in the reaction without protein. Expression of Human ABCA1 in Insect Cells—We constructed a plasmid, pVL1392-ABCA1-TATH, to express human ABCA1 fused with a histidine tag and biotinylation tag at the C terminus, and this was introduced into insect Sf9 cells. Individual plaques were examined for the expression, and Sf9 cells were infected by the purified virus for large scale production and purification. Human ABCA1 expressed in Sf9 cells, about 250 kDa, was found most abundantly in the microsome membrane fraction in 48 h (Fig. 1A), and ABCA1 in the nuclear fraction increased in 72 h. The amount of ABCA1 decreased in 120 h probably due to degradation. Therefore, Sf9 cells were harvested at 48–72 h after infection. The amount of ABCA1 in the microsome membrane fraction accounted for about 1% of total membrane proteins. Glycosylation of ABCA1 Expressed in the Sf9 Membrane—ABCA1 is glycosylated and has two large extracellular domains, which are suggested to be functionally important (24Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P. Mendez A.J. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33178-33187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25Tanaka A.R. Abe-Dohmae S. Ohnishi T. Aoki R. Morinaga G. Okuhira K. Ikeda Y. Kano F. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Murata M. Yokoyama S. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8815-8819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The glycosylation of ABCA1 expressed in Sf9 membranes was examined. The mobility of ABCA1, expressed in Sf9 membranes, in SDS-PAGE became faster by NGF treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). ABCA1 reacted with concanavalin A, which reacts mainly with high mannose-type sugar chains, but ABCA1 treated with NGF did not (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that human ABCA1 expressed in Sf9 is modified with high mannose-type sugar chains. Solubility and Purification of ABCA1—As nonionic-detergent DDM was successfully used to solubilize recombinant ABC proteins (9Lerner-Marmarosh N. Gimi K. Urbatsch I.L. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34711-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), human ABCA1 expressed in the Sf9 membrane was extracted with 0.6% and 0.8% DDM (Fig. 2A). ABCA1, extracted with 0.6% and 0.8% DDM (lanes 1 and 3), migrated a little slower than it remained in the insoluble fraction (lanes 2 and 4). Roughly 50% of ABCA1 was extracted with DDM, and efficiency was not significantly increased even with 1.0% DDM (data not shown). Extracted ABCA1 was purified using Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin (Fig. 2B). ABCA1 was recovered from the resin with 200 mm imidazole (lanes 10 and 11) in 80–90% purity judged from Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Purity was not significantly different between 0.6 and 0.8% DDM extraction. About 100 μg of purified ABCA1 was obtained from 250 mg of microsome membranes of Sf9 cells cultured in 1L suspension culture. Initially we planned to further purify ABCA1 with avidine column after in vitro biotinylation of the tag fused at the C terminus as reported previously (28Julien M. Kajiji S. Kaback R.H. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); however, ABCA1 was not successfully recovered from the avidine column (data not shown). Therefore, we performed anion exchange chromatography using DE52 Sepharose (Fig. 2C). ABCA1, recovered from Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin, was concentrated and mixed with pre-equilibrated DE52 Sepharose. The majority of ABCA1 did not bind to DE52 Sepharose, and ABCA1 could be purified as a flow-through fraction of DE52 (Fig. 2C). ABCA1 was recovered in almost pure form from DE52 Sepharose judging from Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 2C) and silver staining (Fig. 2D). ABCA1 K939M-K1952M protein, expressed and purified in the same procedure, was as pure as the wild type (Figs. 1B and 2E). Trypsin Sensitivity of ABCA1—To confirm that purified ABCA1 retained the correct conformation after the purification procedure, we examined the trypsin sensitivity of ABCA1. ABCA1, endogenously expressed in human fibroblast WI-38 cells, was partially digested by trypsin. ABCA1 was partially cleaved to produce four fragments, 170 and 150 kDa and subsequently 125 and 110 kDa, which were recognized by anti-ABCA1 extracellular domain 1 antibody (KM3073) (Fig. 3A) and two fragments, 170 and 120 kDa, which were recognized by anti-ABCA1 NBF2 antibody (Fig. 3B). These fragments may be assigned to fragments digested at site A, just after the sixth transmembrane α-helix, and at site B, just before the seventh transmembrane α-helix as shown in Fig. 3F. It is predicted that the limited digestion at site A produces 150- and 110-kDa fragments and their glycosylated forms, and the limited digestion at site B produces 155- and 110-kDa fragments and their glycosylated forms as a diagram (Fig. 3F). When these fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, they co-migrated with undigested ABCA1 of about 280 kDa (supplemental Fig. 2). These results suggested that N and C halves of ABCA1 were connected with disulfide bonds. When ABCA1 expressed in Sf9 cells was partially digested with trypsin, ABCA1 produced 140-kDa and subsequently 95-kDa fragments, which were recognized by KM3073 (Fig. 3C), and 155-kDa and subsequently 110-kDa fragments, which were recognized by anti-ABCA1 NBF2 antibody (Fig. 3D). All the produced fragments were smaller than the corresponding ones produced from ABCA1 of WI-38 cells probably due to glycosylation differences. When these fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, they co-migrated with undigested ABCA1 of about 250 kDa (supplemental Fig. 2). These results suggested that ABCA1 expressed in WI-38 cells and Sf9 cells contained similar typsin-sensitive sites (Fig. 3E). Trypsin limited-digestion of purified detergent-soluble ABCA1, producing N-terminal 140- and 95-kDa fragments and C-terminal 155and 110-kDa fragments (Fig. 3E). These fragments well corresponded to the fragments produced from ABCA1 endogenously expressed in WI-38 (Fig. 3, A and B), ABCA1 exogenously expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig. 3, C and D), and HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. 1). These results suggest that purified ABCA1 retains conformation similar to ABCA1 endogenously expressed in human fibroblast membranes. ATPase Activity of ABCA1—The ATPase activity of purified ABCA1 reconstituted in soybean lipids was examined. ATP was hydrolyzed by proteoliposomes in a time-dependent manner at 37 °C, and released phosphate ions increased linearly during 30 min (Fig. 4). Hence, the following ATPase assays were performed at 37 °C for 30 min in this study. Next, we examined ATPase activity in the presence of various concentrations of MgATP. ATPase increased with increasing concentrations of ATP, and the apparent Km for ATP and Vmax were 112 μm and 455 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. The ATPase activity of purified reconstituted ABCA1 varied ranging from 400 to 900 nmol/min/mg of protein depending on preparations. Fig. 5 shows the representative data. To confirm that ATPase activity is derived from purified ABCA1, a baculovirus for ABCA1 K939M-K1952M mutant, in which lysine 939 and lysine 1952 in the Walker A motif of nucleotide binding folds were replaced by methionines, was constructed. These lysines were reported to be indispensable for ATP hydrolysis of ABC proteins (29Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Purified ABCA1 K939M-K1952M protein showed little ATPase activity, less than 10 nmol/min/mg of protein (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the purified ABCA1 reconstituted into soybean lipids shows ATPase activity. Lipid Specificity in Stimulating ABCA1 ATPase—It has been reported that purified MDR1 shows ATPase activity only after reconstitution in liposomes and stimulation by transport substrates (30Doige C.A. Yu X. Sharom F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We compared the ATPase activity of ABCA1 and MDR1 purified with the same procedure (Fig. 6A). Purified human MDR1 (supplemental Fig. 3) reconstituted in soybean lipids showed minimu"
https://openalex.org/W2040331457,"We have previously demonstrated that the serine/threonine protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) plays an important role in promoting cell survival. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PP-1 promotes survival remain largely unknown. In the present study, we provide evidence to show that PP-1 can directly dephosphorylate a master regulator of apoptosis, p53, to negatively modulate its transcriptional and apoptotic activities, and thus to promote cell survival. As a transcriptional factor, the function of p53 can be greatly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. While the kinases responsible for phosphorylation of the 17 serine/threonine sites have been identified, the dephosphorylation of these sites remains largely unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that PP-1 can dephosphorylate p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-37 through co-immunoprecipitation, in vitro and in vivo dephosphorylation assays, overexpression and silence of the gene encoding the catalytic subunit for PP-1. We further show that mutations mimicking constitutive dephosphorylation or phosphorylation of p53 at these sites attenuate or enhance its transcriptional activity, respectively. As a result of the changed p53 activity, expression of the downstream apoptosis-related genes such as bcl-2 and bax is accordingly altered and the apoptotic events are either largely abrogated or enhanced. Thus, our results demonstrate that PP-1 directly dephosphorylates p53, and dephosphorylation of p53 has as important impact on its functions as phosphorylation does. In addition, our results reveal that one of the molecular mechanisms by which PP-1 promotes cell survival is to dephosphorylate p53, and thus negatively regulate p53-dependent death pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2054686270,"The polycomb group protein BMI1 has been shown to support normal stem cell proliferation via its putative stem cell factor function, but it is not known if BMI1 may also act as a cancer stem cell factor to promote cancer development. To determine the role of human BMI1 in cancer growth and survival, we performed a loss-of-function analysis of BMI1 by RNA interference (RNAi) in both normal and malignant human cells. Our results indicate that BMI1 is crucial for the short-term survival of cancer cells but not of normal cells. We also demonstrated that loss of BMI1 was more effective in suppressing cancer cell growth than retinoid-treatment, and surviving cancer cells showed significantly reduced tumorigenicity. The cancer-specific growth retardation was mediated by an increased level of apoptosis and a delayed cell cycle progression due to the loss of BMI1. By comparison, BMI1 deficiency caused only a moderate inhibition of the cell cycle progression in normal lung cells. In both normal and cancer cells, the loss of BMI1 led to an upregulation of INK4A-ARF, but with no significant effect on the level of telomerase gene expression, suggesting that other BMI1-cooperative factors in addition to INK4A-ARF activation may be involved in the BMI1-dependent cancer-specific growth retardation. Thus, human BMI1 is critical for the short-term survival of cancer cells, and inhibition of BMI1 has minimal effect on the survival of normal cells. These findings provide a foundation for developing a cancer-specific therapy targeting BMI1."
https://openalex.org/W2048410843,"Several key amino acids within amphipathic helix 8 of the human β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) were mutagenized to characterize their role in signaling by G protein-coupled receptors. Mutagenesis of phenylalanine at position 383 in the hydrophobic interface to histidine (F383H) prevented the biosynthesis of the receptor, indicating that the orientation of helix 8 is important for receptor biosynthesis. Mutagenesis of aspartic acid at position 382 in the hydrophilic interface to leucine (D382L) reduced the binding and uncoupled the receptor from G protein activation. Mutagenesis of the basic arginine residue at position 384 to glutamine (R384Q) or to glutamic acid (R384E) increased basal and agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities. R384Q and R384E displayed features associated with constitutively active receptors because inverse agonists markedly reduced their elevated basal adenylyl cyclase activities. Isoproterenol increased the phosphorylation and promoted the desensitization of the Gly389 or Arg389 allelic variants of the wild type β1-AR but failed to produce these effects in R384Q and R384E, because these receptors were maximally phosphorylated and desensitized under basal conditions. In contrast to the membranous distribution of the wild type β1-AR, R384Q and R384E were localized mostly within intracellular punctate structures. Inverse agonists restored the membranous distribution of R384Q and R384E, indicating that they recycled normally when their constitutive internalization was blocked by inverse agonists. These data combined with computer modeling of the putative three-dimensional organization of helix 8 indicated that the amphipathic character of helix 8 and side chain projections of Asp382 and Arg384 within the hydrophilic interface might serve as a tethering site for the G protein. Several key amino acids within amphipathic helix 8 of the human β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) were mutagenized to characterize their role in signaling by G protein-coupled receptors.

In contrast to the membranous distribution of the wild type β1-AR, R384Q and R384E were localized mostly within intracellular punctate structures. Inverse agonists restored the membranous distribution of R384Q and R384E, indicating that they recycled normally when their constitutive internalization was blocked by inverse agonists. These data combined with computer modeling of the putative three-dimensional organization of helix 8 indicated that the amphipathic character of helix 8 and side chain projections of Asp382 and Arg384 within the hydrophilic interface might serve as a tethering site for the G protein.

Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 2Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The β1-AR is a major GPCR for mediating the functions of catecholamines. Activation of the β1-AR increases heart rate and myocardial contractility and increases the secretion of renin, all of which contribute to its important role in regulating cardiac function and blood pressure (3Brunton L.L. Lazo J.S. Parker K.L. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics,11th Ed. McGraw Hill Inc., New York2005: 237-254Google Scholar). The β1-AR is a prominent member of class A GPCR, which are structurally related to the visual receptor rhodopsin that propagates its signal through the activation of the G protein transducin (1Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional crystal structure of dark-adapted rhodopsin offers a structural template for other GPCRs, including the assignment of secondary structural elements and the location of highly conserved amino acids (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamomoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5002) Google Scholar). This model can accommodate most of the essential elements of functional importance in G protein activation. Therefore, an evaluation of the β1-AR can be modeled after rhodopsin. The cytoplasmic surface of class A GPCR includes three loops and a C-terminal tail. The first, second, and third loops connect adjacent transmembrane helices. A crucial finding in the crystal structure of rhodopsin was the confirmation that residues in helix 7 and the C-terminal domain form a cytoplasmic helical structure termed helix 8 (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamomoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5002) Google Scholar). Helix 8 is bound by helix 7 at its N terminus and by two palmitoyl groups inserted in the membrane bilayer at its C terminus (5O'Dowd B.F. Hnatowich M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7564-7569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the human β1-AR it is predicted that helix 8 is preceded by a short linker sequence of 3-4 amino acids that begin after the tyrosine residue at position 377 of the NPXXY motif. The linker sequence is followed by a stretch of 10 amino acids that are predicted to form an α-helical structure that constitutes a novel hallmark of class A of the GPCR superfamily (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamomoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5002) Google Scholar). In rhodopsin, helix 8 was involved in coupling rhodopsin to transducin because synthetic peptides corresponding to helix 8 competed with metarhodopsin II in binding transducin (6Konig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In addition, site-directed mutagenesis within helix 8 of rhodopsin indicates that helix 8 is involved in rhodopsin-mediated activation of transducin (7Franke R.R. Konig B. Sakmar T.P. Khorana H.G. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1990; 250: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 8Marin E.P. Krishna A.G. Zvyaga T.A. Isele J. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

Analysis of the role of helix 8 in other GPCR revealed a number of diverse functions attributed to this domain. Helix 8 was involved in regulating surface expression of the melanin concentrating hormone receptor-1 (10Tetsuka M. Saito Y. Imai K. Doi H. Murayama K. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and in the internalization of the bradykinin2 receptor (11Kong S.-D. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 272: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Residues within the hydrophilic interface of putative helix 8 of angiotensin II1A, bradykinin2, and oxytocin receptors were involved in coupling these receptors to Gq (12Faussner A. Bauer A. Kalatskaya I. Schussler S. Seid C. Proud D. Jochum M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 272: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Sano T. Ohyama K. Yamano Y. Nakagomi Y. Nakazawa S. Kikyo M. Shirai H.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3490-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The studies described earlier have focused on the role of helix 8 in Gq-coupled GPCR. Here we characterized site-directed mutants of helix 8 in coupling the human β1-AR to the stimulatory regulatory G protein (Gs). Our detailed analyses show that proper orientation of helix 8 regulates the biosynthesis of the β1-AR, and the charges of key residues in the hydrophilic interface of helix 8 are involved in proper expression and coupling of the β1-AR to Gs. Construction of FLAG-tagged Wild Type and Mutant β1-AR—cDNA encoding the Gly389 variant of the human WT β1-AR (15Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from R. Lefkowitz (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University). To allow rapid assessment of cell surface expression of the β1-AR, the N-terminal initiator methionine was replaced by the FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) resulting in N-FLAG-tagged WT and mutant β1-AR. The 8-amino acid FLAG epitope sequence was inserted at the N terminus of the β1-AR by the PCR using sense primer 5′-AAGCTTATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGGCGCGGGGGTGCTCGTCCTGGGCG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CATGAATTCTACACCTTGGATTCCGAGGCGAAGCCGGG. The 1.5-kb β1-AR cDNA flanked with HindIII (5′) and EcoRI (3′) sites was cloned into the multiple cloning site in the pUC18 plasmid. Point mutations in helix 8 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, using the Transformer™ system (Clontech). The sequence of the mutated β1-AR was verified by dideoxy sequencing, followed by cloning of the mutated full-length β1-AR cDNAs into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA-3.1 (Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—HEK-293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum until they were ∼90% confluent. The WT β1-AR or its point mutants in pcDNA 3.1 were transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells using the Cytofectene reagent (Bio-Rad) as follows. Plasmid DNA (5 μg) was diluted into 200 μl of DMEM and then mixed with an equal volume of DMEM containing 12 μl of Cytofectene at room temperature for 20 min. Then 4 ml of DMEM was added, and the DNA-lipid complex was layered over the cells for 5 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of an equal volume of DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable cell lines for Gly389, G389R, D382L, R384E, and R384Q were used where indicated. Preparation of Membranes and Radioligand Binding Assays—Transiently transfected or stable cell lines on 10-cm culture plates were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, then scraped from the plates, and pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 × gav for 10 min. The cell pellets were suspended in 10 ml of hypotonic buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin with or without 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min on ice. The cells were lysed by 30 up-and-down strokes in a glass-glass homogenizer and then centrifuged at 2,500 × gav for 5 min. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 15,000 × gav for 20 min to pellet the membranes. Binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) to 0.5 μg of membranes was measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, plus 10 mm MgCl2 binding buffer containing 0.1 mm ascorbic acid for 2 h at 25°C. For saturation binding experiments, ICYP concentrations ranging between 5 and 300 pm were used to calculate the KD and the Bmax values for ICYP binding by parametric fitting of the data using the Prism 4 software (Graph-Pad Corp.). For competition binding experiments, ICYP 70 pm was competed with 24 increasing concentrations of isoproterenol ranging from 0.01 nm to 10 μm. The IC50 (high) and IC50 (low) values for isoproterenol were derived from two-compartment competition to the GTP data. The IC50 values were converted to the corresponding KI (high) and KI (low) values using Equation 1, KI=IC50(nM)(1+concentration of ICYP/KD)(Eq. 1) Each saturation and competition experiment was in triplicate, and each was replicated between three and five times to determine the means ± S.E. Cyclic AMP Accumulation and Adenylyl Cyclase Assays—Transiently transfected cells in 6-well plates were switched to DMEM + 25 mm HEPES for 2 h. Appropriate drugs in DMEM/HEPES, supplemented with 300 μm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine, were added to the cells for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped, and 1 ml of 0.1 n cold HCl was added followed by freezing of the entire plate in liquid nitrogen. Frozen plates were quickly thawed at 65 °C to break the cells, and the cell extract was lyophilized. The dry pellet was resuspended in assay buffer, and cyclic AMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIANEN Assay System, DuPont). For the determination of adenylyl cyclase activity, membranes were prepared from cells without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fifty μg of membrane proteins were incubated in a final volume of 0.1 ml in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2,10mm phosphocreatine, 1 mm cyclic AMP, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.4 mm EGTA, 2 mg/ml creatine kinase, 0.2 mm ATP containing 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, 1 mm GTP, and increasing concentrations of isoproterenol from 0.1 nm to1mm. The assay was initiated by the addition of membranes and terminated after 10 min (16Bahouth S.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP that was formed was separated from ATP by column chromatography, and its specific activity was determined as cyclic AMP formed in pmol/min/mg protein. Intact Cell Phosphorylation and β1-AR Immunoprecipitation—Cell cultures were switched to phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 12.5 m m HEPES for 60 min. Then they were incubated with 100 μCi of 32Pi/ml for 2 h at 37°C to equilibrate the [32P]ATP pools. The cells were exposed to 1 mm ascorbic acid (control) or 10 μm isoproterenol for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by rapid aspiration of this medium. The cells were lysed with 1 ml/plate of ice-cold RIPA, and SDS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) was added. The cells were scraped, sonicated briefly, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × gav for 5 min at 4 °C. From the supernatant, two 5-μl aliquots were removed for protein assay. The remaining volume was processed for immunoprecipitation; each step thereafter was conducted at 0-4 °C (17Bahouth S.W. Gokmen-Polar Y. Coronel E.C. Fain J.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1049-1057PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 IgG-agarose beads and incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotating platform. The resin was washed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer, and then 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol was added, and the slurry was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min to release the IgG-β1-AR complex from the resin. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 10% acrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS, dried, and exposed to autoradiography. The relative amounts of 32P incorporated into the β1-AR band were determined by electronic counting of the gel by the InstantImager™. Acid Strip Confocal Recycling Microscopy Protocol—HEK-293 cells expressing the FLAG-tagged WT β1-AR and its helix 8 point mutants or the pCMV-Tag2 vector (Stratagene) were grown on poly l-lysinecoated glass coverslips and serum-starved at 37 °C for 1 h in DMEM supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The receptors were labeled with FITC-conjugated to anti-FLAG M2 IgG (5 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were treated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C to promote agonist-mediated receptor internalizaion. Then the cells were chilled in 4 °C Tris-buffered saline to stop endocytosis and exposed to 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 m acetic acid, pH 3.5, for 4 min on ice to remove antibody bound to the β1-AR (18Snyder E.M.

Cultures were quickly rinsed in warm DMEM supplemented with HEPES and then incubated with 100 μm of the β-antagonist alprenolol at 37 °C for 10, 20, 30, or 45 min. After each time period, the coverslips were rinsed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 4% sucrose in PBS, pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature (19Gardner L.A. Delos Santos N.M. Matta S.G. Whitt M.A. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21135-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To ascertain that the recycled receptor trafficked back to the membrane, coverslips that were incubated with alprenolol for 45 min were exposed to 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 m acetic acid for 4 min on ice to strip the antibody from receptors that have recycled during that time frame. Effect of Inverse Agonists on the Localization of Helix 8 Mutants in HEK-293—Cells expressing the WT β1-AR, D382L, R384E, or R384Q were incubated with buffer (control condition) or with 100 μm of the inverse agonists alprenolol or CGP-20712A for 2 h at 37°C. Cultures were rinsed and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 4% sucrose in PBS and then permeabilized in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 2% normal goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin (20Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). β1-AR was labeled with FITC conjugated to anti-FLAG M2 antibody at room temperature for 1 h to label surface-exposed and internalized β1-AR. To estimate the effect of the inverse agonists on the distribution of receptors, a circular boundary was drawn around the inner circumference of control and inverse agonist-treated cells to define a 300-nm-wide membrane-delimited area (21Guthrie C.R. Murray A.T. Franklin A.A. Hamblin M.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 313: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity measurements were calculated in the areas outside and inside the boundary to estimate the membranous versus internal pixels. These measurements were repeated in slides with a similar threshold setting in which the radii for each boundary did not differ by ±15%. Data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test (Prism 4 program) and expressed as mean ± S.E. Analysis of Immunocytochemical Data—All analyses were performed blind to the stimulation history of the culture. Microscope fields had 1-3 cells displaying generally healthy morphology. Six to 10 cells were imaged per culture, and n = 10 cultures were processed per condition. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed on all the slides using Zeiss Axiovert LSM 510 (100 × 1.4 DIC oil immersion objective). FITC was excited with the 488-nm argon laser and imaged through the 520-nm long-pass emission filter. Thresholds were set by visual inspection and kept constant for each condition. Z-stacks of images were exported as TIFF files, and individual sections were analyzed with Zeiss LSM 510 and NIH Image 1.6 software as described in Gardner et al. (19Gardner L.A. Delos Santos N.M. Matta S.G. Whitt M.A. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21135-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In confocal recycling assays, the time constants (τ) for β1-AR recycling were determined by fitting the data to a single exponential decay function of the y = yo + Ae -tτ, where yo and A are constants The effects of inverse agonists on pixel densities inside the boundary were determined by confocal microscopy (19Gardner L.A. Delos Santos N.M. Matta S.G. Whitt M.A. Bahouth S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21135-21143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Internal pixel densities in control cells were arbitrarily set as 100, and the data for each inverse agonist was calculated as % of this value. In acid-striped slides, the boundary method was not use. Instead, total cellular pixel densities were calculated. The ratios of pixel densities in inverse agonist-treated cells to pixel densities in control cells were determined to calculate the effect of the inverse agonist on this parameter. The data represent the mean of the various % values ± S.E. from five slides each involving between 6 and 10 cells. Molecular Modeling of Wild Type and Mutant β1-AR—Homology modeling was performed with the program SegMod (22Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 507-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The program was used to optimally align the sequences of the human β1-AR and bovine rhodopsin, and then the sequence of the β1-AR was threaded onto the rhodopsin structure based upon the 1F88 (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamomoto M. Miyano M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) models of rhodopsin oligomers deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The resulting homology model was then refined according to SegMod protocols. The figures were produced using MOLSCRIPT (24Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and rendered with RASTER3D (25Merrit E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 227: 505-524Crossref Scopus (3873) Google Scholar) that was also used to estimate the distances in angstroms between the various amino acids. Data Analysis—Quantitative data were summarized and presented as means ± S.E. from at least four determinations each from triplicate experiments. Least squares linear regression and nonlinear curves were calculated by the Prism 4 program (Graphpad version 4.05) to estimate the Kact of each β1-AR in stimulating the activity of adenylyl cyclase. Statistical comparisons were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with post hoc tests using Graphpad Prism program. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin indicates that a partially exposed α-helix termed helix 8 is located between TM7 and the palmitoylated cysteines in the C terminus. The corresponding region in the human β1-AR is the sequence between Pro381 and Leu390 (Table 1). The distribution of side chains in helix 8 of rhodopsin exhibits an amphiphilic pattern, where charged polar groups cluster on one side and hydrophobic ones cluster on the other side of the helix (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamomoto M. Miyano M.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Based upon the rhodopsin model, it is expected that the corresponding hydrophobic amino acids in the human β1-AR, Phe383 and Phe387, will be buried in the hydrophobic core of the helix facing the inner leaf of the membrane, whereas the charged polar groups Arg384, Lys385, and Gln388 would cluster on the other side of the α-helix that is exposed to the cytoplasmic environment. As shown in Table 1, the identity and location of the two hydrophobic Phe residues are conserved in class A of GPCR. On the hydrophilic side of the helix, the residue corresponding to Arg384 is always a basic amino acid such as Arg or Lys, whereas the residues corresponding to Lys385 and Gln388 are not conserved.TABLE 1Alignment of the sequences of predicted helix 8 of mammalian class A GPCR Open table in a new tab To test the validity of this model in predicting the structure-activity relationship of these residues, 11 point mutations were introduced into putative helix 8 of the N-terminally FLAG-tagged human β1-AR (Table 2). We used the BiotecniX 3D (Gentech Corp.) computer program to verify that none of the point mutations disrupted the predicted α-helical secondary structure of helix 8.TABLE 2Ligand binding properties of isoproterenol at the wild type and helix 8 β1-AR mutantsExpression vectorIC50 highRHIC50 lowRLKDBmaxKI highKI lownm%μm%pmpmol/mgnmμmWT β1-AR1.4 ± 0.4500.4 ± 0.15015.1 ± 41.3 ± 0.40.3 ± 0.040.1 ± 0.003D382L290 ± 37ND8.3 ± 2ND17.2 ± 51.5 ± 0.557 ± 81.6 ± 0.3R384E0.08 ± 0.003470.01 ± 0.0055313.8 ± 51 ± 0.20.02 ± 0.0070.002 ± 0.0007R384Q0.015 ± 0.003600.04 ± 0.0034027 ± 21.2 ± 0.250.004 ± 0.00030.011 ± 0.002R384K21 ± 4551.5 ± 0.74523 ± 40.58 ± 0.25.2 ± 0.30.37 ± 0.04R384F7 ± 0.04541 ± 0.34619 ± 50.47 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.08R384H6 ± 0.4360.7 ± 0.16420 ± 41.2 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.040.2 ± 0.04K385R0.8 ± 0.04320.4 ± 0.066819 ± 31.1 ± 0.32 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.06K385E0.9 ± 0.05321.1 ± 0.26817 ± 30.6 ± 0.250.25 ± 0.031 ± 0.2K385M31 ± 5524.2 ± 0.34816 ± 40.8 ± 0.22.6 ± 0.32 ± 0.4G389R0.5 ± 0.06700.2 ± 0.033013 ± 21.1 ± 0.30.1 ± 0.020.05 ± 0.005 Open table in a new tab Expression and Ligand Binding Properties of Helix 8 Mutants—Immunoblot analyses of detergent extracts prepared from HEK-293 cells that were transiently transfected with the various helix 8 mutants revealed that monomers and dimers of the 73-kDa β1-AR were expressed (Fig. 1). The expression patterns of the various helix 8 mutants were comparable with that of the WT β1-AR with the exception of the F383H mutant. The highly conserved hydrophobic Phe383 when mutated to a charged basic His residue (F383H) was not synthesized as a mature protein and did not result in detectable radioligand binding activity (Table 2). The other point mutants were tested for the pharmacological character of their radioligand binding profiles (Table 2). Helix 8 mutants bound the radiolabeled β-AR antagonist [125I]ICYP with KD values between 15 and 25 pm, which were comparable with the KD value of the WT β1-AR. In addition, the Bmax values of the various helix 8 mutants were comparable with the Bmax values of the WT β1-AR. The high and low affinity states for isoproterenol binding to the β1-AR were modeled by two-site analysis of the competition isotherms of isoproterenol (Fig. 2). The percentage of receptors in the high affinity state for agonists was comparable among the different helix 8 mutants (Table 2). The affinities of some point mutants to isoproterenol, however, were not comparable (Fig. 2). Specifically, mutagenesis of the negatively charged amino acid Asp382 to a nonpolar hydrophobic Leu (D382L) produced a mutant β1-AR with ∼200-fold lower affinity to isoproterenol than the WT β1-AR (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Mutagenesis of the basic Arg384 amino acid to the acidic and polar glutamic acid or to the neutral and polar glutamine had the opposite effect (Fig. 2). The affinities of the R384E or R384Q to isoproterenol were 10-50-fold higher than the WT β1-AR (Table 2). However, mutagenesis of Arg384 to the two other basic amino acids Lys (R384K) and histidine (R384H) or neutralization of its charge with an amino acid of comparable mass such as Phe (R384F) reduced the binding affinity of isoproterenol to these mutants by ∼5-20-fold, and these differences in the KI were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Therefore, it is possible to alter the binding affinity of the β1-AR to agonists through selective mutations in"
https://openalex.org/W1968511086,"Nucleophosmin (NPM) is a nucleus-cytoplasmic shuttling protein that is implicated in centrosome duplication, cell cycle progression and stress response. At the steady state, NPM localizes mainly in the nucleolus, where it forms a complex with different cellular proteins. One-third of acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are characterized by aberrant cytoplasmic localization of NPM, due to mutations within its last coding exon (exon 12) that cause a frameshift and the formation of novel C-termini. We report here our investigations on the molecular basis for the aberrant localization of mutated NPM. Alignment of the C-terminus of the various NPM mutants revealed the obligatory presence of four amino-acid residues that match a CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES). Single alanine-substitutions at these sites provoked nuclear re-localization, while fusion of the mutated C-terminus to a heterologous nuclear protein induced CRM1-dependent cytoplasmic localization. Molecular characterization of one exceptional AML carrying cytoplasmic NPM and germ line exon 12 revealed a somatic mutation in the splicing donor site of exon 9 that caused the formation of a functional NES. It appears, therefore, that AMLs are frequently characterized by gain-of-function mutations of NPM that create functional NES, suggesting that alterations of nuclear export might represent a general mechanism of leukemogenesis and a novel target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1965216866,"Here, we show that ectopic expression of the catalytic subunit of mouse telomerase (mTert) confers a growth advantage to primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which have very long telomeres, as well as facilitates their spontaneous immortalization and increases their colony-forming capacity upon activation of oncogenes. We demonstrate that these telomere length-independent growth-promoting effects of mTert overexpression require catalytically active mTert, as well as the formation of mTert/Terc complexes. The gene expression profile of mTert-overexpressing MEFs indicates that telomerase enhances growth in these cells through the repression of growth-inhibiting genes of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling network. We functionally validate this result by showing that mTert abrogates the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-β in MEFs, thus demonstrating that telomerase increments the proliferative potential of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts by targeting the TGF-β pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2059938704,"FAT10 is a member of the ubiquitin-like modifier family of proteins and has been implicated to play important roles in antigen presentation, cytokine response, apoptosis and mitosis. We have recently demonstrated the upregulation of FAT10 gene expression in 90% of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Here, we identified and characterized the promoter of the FAT10 gene to elucidate the mechanism of FAT10 gene expression. Notably, we found that the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR), from the transcription start site to 15 bases before the translational start site, displays significant promoter activity. Regions upstream of the 5′UTR (from +26 to −1997) do not confer any promoter activity. Curiously, FAT10 promoter activity and expression is significantly repressed in KB3-1 and HepG2 cells, which have wild-type p53, than in p53-negative Hep3B cells. The role of p53 in regulating FAT10 expression was evident by the significant downregulation (P<0.05) of FAT10 mRNA expression and promoter activity when wild-type p53 was transfected into p53-null Hep3B cells. Conversely, inhibiting p53 expression through siRNA against p53 significantly enhanced FAT10 expression and promoter activity. p53 was found to bind in vivo to the 5′ half consensus sequence of p53-binding site located at the FAT10 promoter. Hence, we propose that FAT10 is a downstream target of p53 and dysregulation of FAT10 expression in p53-defective cells could contribute to carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2100008990,"Claspin is a Chk1-interacting protein that participates in the DNA replication checkpoint. Expression of Claspin fluctuates in a cell cycle-dependent manner, but the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Claspin protein levels have not been explored. In this study, we show that Claspin expression is downregulated by the proteasome-mediated degradation pathway and that Chk1 is required to maintain Claspin stability. Downregulation of Chk1 expression by siRNA or inhibition of Chk1 activity by UCN01 decreases Claspin levels in cells. Conversely, overexpression of Chk1 increases Claspin levels. These data indicate a role of Chk1 in regulating Claspin stability in the cell. Since Claspin has also been shown to participate in Chk1 activation following DNA damage, we further explored the exact role of Claspin during Chk1 activation following replication stress. We observed that while Rad17 is required for early Chk1 activation after hydroxyurea treatment, Claspin is only required to sustain Chk1 activation. Based on these findings, we propose that Claspin functions at late stages of Chk1 activation following DNA damage. Once Chk1 is activated, it stabilizes Claspin, which in turn helps to maintain Chk1 activation during replication stress. In summary, these data indicate that the interaction between Claspin and Chk1 is complex. These proteins regulate each other and thus ensure the proper cell cycle progression and replication checkpoint control."

https://openalex.org/W2053147978,"The promyelocytic leukemia gene was first identified through its fusion to the gene encoding the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. The promyelocytic leukemia gene product (PML) becomes conjugated in vivo to the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1, altering its behavior and capacity to recruit other proteins to PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). In the NB4 cell line, which was derived from an APL patient and expresses PML:RARα, we observed a retinoic acid-dependent change in the modification of specific proteins by SUMO-1. To dissect the interaction of PML with the SUMO-1 modification pathway, we used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system through expression of PML and human SUMO-1 (hSUMO-1). We found that PML stimulated hSUMO-1 modification in yeast, in a manner that was dependent upon PML's RING-finger domain. PML:RARα also stimulated hSUMO-1 conjugation in yeast. Interestingly, however, PML and PML:RARα differentially complemented yeast Smt3p conjugation pathway mutants. These findings point toward a potential function of PML and PML:RARα as SUMO E3 enzymes or E3 regulators, and suggest that fusion of RARα to PML may affect this activity."
https://openalex.org/W1985059446,"Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulates the activation of multiple signaling pathways, leading to alterations in the activities of transcription factors. Gfi-1 is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that is required for granulopoiesis. How Gfi-1 acts in myeloid cells is poorly understood. We show here that the expression of Gfi-1 was up-regulated during G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation in myeloid 32D cells. Truncation of the carboxyl terminus of the G-CSF receptor, as seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia evolving from severe congenital neutropenia, disrupted Gfi-1 up-regulation by G-CSF. Ectopic expression of a dominant negative Gfi-1 mutant, N382S, which was associated with severe congenital neutropenia, resulted in premature apoptosis and reduced proliferation of cells induced to differentiate with G-CSF. The expression of neutrophil elastase (NE) and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein ϵ (C/EBPϵ) was significantly increased in 32D cells expressing N382S. In contrast, overexpression of wild type Gfi-1 abolished G-CSF-induced up-regulation of C/EBPϵ but had no apparent effect on NE up-regulation by G-CSF. Notably, G-CSF-dependent proliferation and survival were inhibited upon overexpression of C/EBPϵ but not NE. These data indicate that Gfi-1 down-regulates C/EBPϵ expression and suggest that increased expression of C/EBPϵ as a consequence of loss of Gfi-1 function may be deleterious to the proliferation and survival of early myeloid cells.

The production of mature granulocytes, a process known as granulopoiesis, is regulated, at least in part, by a network of hematopoietic cytokines and growth factors. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 2The abbreviations used are: G-CSF, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor; NE, neutrophil elastase; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; SCN, severe congenital neutropenia; IL-3, interleukin-3; C-EBP, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type; Puro, puromycin. 2The abbreviations used are: G-CSF, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor; NE, neutrophil elastase; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; SCN, severe congenital neutropenia; IL-3, interleukin-3; C-EBP, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; WT, wild type; Puro, puromycin. is a hematopoietic cytokine that plays a major role in granulopoiesis (1Demetri G.D. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1991; 78: 2791-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G-CSF supports the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of myeloid progenitor cells. The biological activities of G-CSF are mediated by its cognate receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily (2Avalos B.R.

Treatment of cells with G-CSF activates multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways leading to up- or down-regulation of genes that either positively or negatively regulate myeloid development. Regulation of gene expression in myeloid cells is achieved by coordinated activities of transcriptional activators and repressors. Transcription factors including the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), C/EBPϵ, PU.1, and c-Myb have been implicated in myeloid development. Expression of some of the myeloid transcription factors such as C/EBPα and C/EBPϵ is regulated by G-CSF during granulocytic differentiation (4Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Rorth P. Friedman A.D.

Despite its critical role in granulopoiesis, how Gfi-1 functions in myeloid cells remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that Gfi-1 expression was up-regulated during G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation and that the carboxyl-terminal region of the G-CSF receptor was required for Gfi-1 up-regulation by G-CSF. We also show that expression of a dominant negative Gfi-1 mutant, associated with SCN, suppressed the proliferation and survival of cells stimulated by G-CSF and led to increased expression of NE and C/EBPϵ. We further demonstrate that overexpression of C/EBPϵ, but not NE, attenuated G-CSF-dependent cell proliferation and survival. These data indicate that Gfi-1 represses C/EBPϵ expression, and a potential role of Gfi-1 in granulopoiesis is to prevent C/EBPϵ overexpression at early stages of granulocytic differentiation.

Puromycin-resistant cells were subcloned by limiting dilution. Individual clones were examined for expression of the transfected genes by Western blot analysis. L-G cells were electroporated with the Gfi-1 expression constructs along with pLNCX vector and selected in medium containing G418 (1 mg/ml). Cells surviving G418 selection were subcloned, and pools of GFP-negative and GFP-positive clones were used in subsequent experiments. Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in regular lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm vanadate). After incubation on ice for 20 min, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Whole cell extracts were boiled in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE prior to transfer to Immobilon membranes. The membranes were incubated with the appropriate antibodies, and the reactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with RNA-Bee™ RNA isolation reagent (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). 10 μgof RNA was run on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was prehybridized for 1 h at 42 °C in NorthernMax™ hybridiztion buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX) and hybridized overnight at 42 °C after the addition of the [α-32P]-labeled probes. The membrane was washed and developed. The probe for NE was obtained from 32D cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers 5′-CAGAGGCGTGGAGGTCATTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGATGGGTAAGAAGGTGGTCATTAT G-3′ (reverse).

Cells (4 × 106) were washed and incubated overnight at 42 °C in 400 μl of digestion buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K. 130 μl of 6 m NaCl was added and centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 15 min after vigorous shaking. The supernatants were collected and mixed with 2 volumes of absolute ethanol prior to centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. DNA pellets were washed in 70% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA). DNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were collected at different times of G-CSF treatment and fixed with 70% ethanol at –20 °C prior to staining with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in the presence of 0.05% of Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml RNase A, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson), and the data were analyzed using the program Cellquest.

Blood. 1999; 93: 440-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the d715 receptor was expressed more abundantly than the WT receptor. 32D cells expressing the WT G-CSF receptor (32D/WT) proliferated transiently and terminally differentiated into mature granulocytes upon induction with G-CSF. In contrast, 32D cells expressing the d715 receptor (32D/d715) or both the WT and the d715 receptors (32D/WT/d715) grew continuously but failed to differentiate in G-CSF (24Dong F. Brynes R.K.

The different 32D cells were cultured in G-CSF for various times, after which RNA was extracted and examined for Gfi-1 expression by Northern blot analysis. Gif-1 mRNA increased steadily in 32D/WT cells, reaching peak level by day 6 and declining thereafter (Fig. 1C). No significant up-regulation of Gfi-1 mRNA was observed when 32D/d715 cells were cultured in G-CSF for up to 8 days. Gfi-1 up-regulation by G-CSF was markedly attenuated in 32D/WT/d715 cells. These data indicate that the carboxyl-terminal region of the G-CSF receptor was required for induction of Gfi-1 by G-CSF and that the d715 mutant exerted a dominant negative effect on Gfi-1 up-regulation mediated by the wild type G-CSF receptor. Mutations in GFI-1 gene have been reported in neutropenic patients (23Person R.E. Li F.Q. Duan Z. Benson K.F. Wechsler J. Papadaki H.A. Eliopoulos G. Kaufman C. Bertolone S.J. Nakamoto B.

To evaluate the importance of Gfi-1 function in cellular response to G-CSF, we transfected 32D/WT cells with Gfi-1 or the N382S mutant, which was associated with SCN (23Person R.E. Li F.Q. Duan Z. Benson K.F. Wechsler J. Papadaki H.A. Eliopoulos G. Kaufman C. Bertolone S.J. Nakamoto B. Papayannopoulou T. Grimes H.L. Horwitz M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The expression of Gfi-1 and the N382S mutant was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). As compared with cells transfected with the empty vector (32D/Puro) or Gfi-1 (32D/Gfi-1), 32D/WT cells expressing the N382S mutant (32D/N382S) grew somewhat slower but showed comparable viability in IL-3-containing culture medium (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Upon transfer to medium containing G-CSF, 32D/N382S cells displayed markedly reduced growth and rapidly lost viability (Fig. 2, C and D). The inhibitory effect of the N382S mutant on cell proliferation and survival was seen in six independent 32D/N382S clones including those expressing low levels of N382S protein (data not shown). 32D/Puro and 32D/Gfi-1 cells displayed comparable growth and survival in culture medium containing IL-3 or G-CSF. Unlike T cells that became growth factor-independent upon Gfi-1 overexpression (12Grimes H.L. Chan T.O. Zweidler-McKay P.A. Tong B. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell.

We assessed whether expression of the N382S mutant affected cell cycle distributions by measuring DNA content after propidium iodide staining. 32D/N382S cells exhibited increased G0/G1 and decreased S/G2 distributions as compared with 32D/Puro and 32D/Gfi-1 cells (Fig. 3). Although 32D/N382S cells died rapidly in G-CSF, treatment with G-CSF for up to 2 days did not significantly alter their cell cycle distributions. Morphological examination of 32D/N382S cells cultured in G-CSF for 3 days revealed that a large proportion of cells displayed the features characteristic of apoptosis including membrane blebbing, shrinkage of cytoplasm, and condensation/fragmentation of nuclei but not terminal granulocytic differentiation (Fig. 4A). Consistent with apoptotic morphological features, genomic DNA isolated from G-CSF-treated 32D/N382S generated a typical oligonucleosomal DNA ladder (Fig. 4B). Notably, although no significant cell death was observed when 32D/N382S cells were cultured in IL-3, DNA from the cells consistently produced a ladder pattern. 32D/Puro and 32D/Gfi-1 cells remained morphologically immature and showed no significant cell death at day 3 of G-CSF treatment (Fig. 4A). At day 9 of G-CSF induction, most 32D/Puro cells differentiated into mature granulocytes with segmented nuclei. As compared with 32D/Puro cells, 32D/Gfi-1 cells appeared morphologically less mature after G-CSF treatment for 9 days.FIGURE 4Apoptosis of 32D/N382S cells cultured in G-CSF-containing medium.

We investigated the possibility that the N382S mutant caused apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of Bax and Bak. Whole cell extracts were prepared from 32D/Puro, 32D/Gfi-1, and 32D/N382S cells maintained in IL-3 or incubated in G-CSF for different days. The levels of Bax and Bak were examined by Western blot analysis. Expression of N382S mutant did not significantly increase the levels of Bax and Bak in 32D cells (Fig. 5). We also examined the expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. As shown in Fig. 5, the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were not significantly decreased in 32D/N382S cells. The ELA2 gene encoding NE has been identified as a target of Gfi-1 (19Hock H. Hamblen M.J. Rooke H.M. Traver D. Bronson R.T. Cameron S. Orkin S.H.

A. 2003; 100: 5932-5937Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NE expression in the different 32D clones was examined by Northern blot analysis. NE mRNA was low in 32D cells cultured in IL-3 and induced upon G-CSF treatment (Fig. 6A). Induction of NE expression by G-CSF was comparable in 32D/Puro and 32D/Gfi-1 cells but was significantly greater in 32D/N382S cells. In addition to ELA2, the genes encoding several myeloid transcription factors have been shown to contain Gfi-1 binding sites and may represent potential Gfi-1 targets (41Duan Z. Horwitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5932-5937Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We examined the expression of C/EBPα, C/EBPϵ, and PU.1, which are critically implicated in myeloid development. The protein levels of C/EBPα and PU.1 were comparable in the different 32D clones (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the amount of C/EBPϵ was significantly higher in 32D/N382S cells than in 32D/Puro and 32D/Gfi-1 cells. In line with previous reports (5Morosetti R. Park D.J. Chumakov A.M. Grillier I.

A. 1996; 93: 13158-13163Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), G-CSF treatment resulted in dramatic increase in the amount of C/EBPϵ in 32D/Puro cells (Fig. 6C). However, C/EBPϵ up-regulation was completely blocked in 32D/Gfi-1 cells. Together, these data indicated that Gfi-1 repressed the expression of C/EBPϵ in 32D cells. To investigate whether expression of the N382S mutant in other myeloid cells may have similar effects on C/EBPϵ expression and cellular response to G-CSF, we stably transfected murine myeloid L-G cells with the N382S mutant (Fig. 7A). L-G cells expressed the endogenous G-CSF receptor and terminally differentiated into mature granulocytes in response to G-CSF (35Lee K.H. Kinashi T. Tohyama K. Tashiro K. Funato N. Hama K. Honjo T. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression of the N382S mutant in L-G cells dramatically increased the level of C/EBPϵ but did not affect the expression of C/EBPα and PU.1. Similar to 32D/N382S cells, L-G cells transfected with the N382S mutant died rapidly upon transfer to G-CSF-containing medium (Fig. 7B). Thus, the N382S mutant augmented C/EBPϵ expression and suppressed G-CSF-stimulated cell proliferation and survival in both 32D and L-G cells. To explore whether increased expression of NE and C/EBPϵ contributed to the negative effect of the N382S mutant on cell proliferation and survival, we overexpressed NE and C/EBPϵ in 32D/WT cells (Fig. 8A). 32D/WT cells overexpressing NE and C/EBPϵ were cultured in G-CSF for different days. As shown in Fig. 8B, overexpression of NE had no apparent effect on G-CSF-dependent proliferation and survival. In contrast, overexpression of C/EBPϵ markedly inhibited the proliferation and survival of 32D cells cultured in G-CSF. Similar to 32D/N382S cells, 32D/WT cells overexpressing C/EBPϵ (32D/CEBPϵ) displayed typical morphological features of apoptosis but not terminal granulocytic differentiation (data not shown). C/EBPϵ overexpression had no significant effect on the proliferation and survival of 32D/WT cultured in IL-3 (data not shown). Targeted gene disruption in mice has revealed a critical role of Gfi-1 in granulopoiesis (18Karsunky H. Zeng H. Schmidt T. Zevnik B. Kluge R. Schmid K.W. Duhrsen U. Moroy T. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 19Hock H. Hamblen M.J. Rooke H.M. Traver D. Bronson R.T. Cameron S. Orkin S.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Gfi-1 functions in myeloid cells remains obscure. In this study, we have shown that Gfi-1 mRNA is up-regulated during granulocytic differentiation induced by G-CSF. We have also shown that the carboxyl-terminal region of the G-CSF receptor, truncated in patients with AML/SCN, is required for Gfi-1 up-regulation by G-CSF. Our data further demonstrate that expression of the N382S mutant of Gfi-1, associated with SCN, causes premature apoptosis and reduced proliferation of myeloid 32D and L-G cells induced to differentiate with G-CSF. Together, these results indicate that Gfi-1 function is required for the survival and proliferation of myeloid cells and may explain why loss of Gfi-1 function, as a result of either gene knock-out in mice or gene mutations in human, results in a block of granulocytic differentiation and severe neutropenia. Gfi-1 represses transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences in target genes (43Zweidler-Mckay P.A. Grimes H.L. Flubacher M.M. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4024-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The N382S mutant is defective in DNA binding and acts in a dominant negative manner to block repression by Gfi-1 (23Person R.E. Li F.Q. Duan Z. Benson K.F. Wechsler J. Papadaki H.A. Eliopoulos G. Kaufman C. Bertolone S.J. Nakamoto B. Papayannopoulou T. Grimes H.L. Horwitz M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). ELA2 encoding NE has been identified as the Gfi-1 target. Expression of NE was elevated in hematopoietic cells from patients with N382S mutation and Gfi-1-deficient mice (19Hock H. Hamblen M.J. Rooke H.M. Traver D. Bronson R.T. Cameron S. Orkin S.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 23Person R.E. Li F.Q. Duan Z. Benson K.F. Wechsler J. Papadaki H.A. Eliopoulos G. Kaufman C.

Consistent with these studies, expression of the N382S mutant in 32D cells resulted in a greater increase in NE transcript in response to G-CSF. Notably, mutations in ELA2 are present in the majority of patients with SCN, and the NE mutants derived from SCN patients cause premature apoptosis of differentiating myeloid cells (27Aprikyan A.A.

Bunnell B.A. Hunter M.G. Robinson J.M. Marsh C.B. Avalos B.R. Blood. 2005; 105: 3397-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Gfi-1 mutants may achieve a similar effect as NE mutants by causing NE overexpression (22Horwitz M. Benson K.F. Duan Z. Li F.Q. Person R.E. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 163-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of NE failed to significantly influence G-CSF-dependent proliferation and survival in myeloid 32D cells. Our data argue against NE overexpression as a primary mechanism by which the N382S mutant exerts its negative effect on granulocytic differentiation, although the possibility cannot be excluded that NE overexpression may play a contributing role in the pathogenesis of neutropenia. In addition to NE, expression of the N382S mutant in myeloid 32D and L-G cells dramatically increased the level of C/EBPϵ, whereas the levels of C/EBPα and PU.1 were not significantly altered. Furthermore, overexpression of Gfi-1 in 32D cells completely abolished G-CSF-induced up-regulation of C/EBPϵ but had no apparent effect on NE up-regulation by G-CSF, suggesting that Cebpe, which encodes C/EBPϵ, is more sensitive to repression by Gfi-1 than Ela2. Our results are in contrast to a recent report showing that C/EBPϵ transcript was decreased in the bone marrow cells from Gfi-1-deficient mice (19Hock H. Hamblen M.J. Rooke H.M. Traver D. Bronson R.T. Cameron S. Orkin S.H. Immunity. 2003; 18: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, Gfi-1-deficient mice lack mature granulocytes in the bone marrow, whereas the majority of granulocytes in the bone marrow of normal mice are mature or at late stages of differentiation. Because C/EBPϵ expression increases dramatically with terminal granulocytic differentiation (6Nakajima H. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2001; 98: 897-8905Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 45Yamanaka R. Kim G.D. Radomska H.S. Lekstrom-Himes J. Smith L.T. Antonson P. Tenen D.G. Xanthopoulos K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Investig. 1999; 103: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the lack of mature granulocytes in Gfi-1-deficient mice may explain why C/EBPϵ expression was reduced in Gfi-1-deficient bone marrow cells. In support of this notion, C/EBPϵ level was lower in 32D/N382S cells than in 32D/Puro cells treated with G-CSF for 6 days (data not shown). It should be pointed out that up-regulation of Gfi-1 during G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation appears contradictory to the markedly increased level of C/EBPϵ in late granulocytes. However, Gfi-1 binding to the promoter of CEBPE diminishes sharply with granulocytic differentiation (41Duan Z. Horwitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5932-5937Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), presumably as a result of more closed chromatin configuration in late granulocytes. Recruitment of Gfi-1 to other potential target genes also decreases during the course of granulocytic differentiation (41Duan Z. Horwitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5932-5937Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Gfi-1 up-regulation may represent a compensatory mechanism for the loss of Gfi-1 binding to its target genes in differentiating granulocytes. Overexpression of C/EBPϵ in myeloid cells has been shown to suppress cell growth and survival and drive granulocytic differentiation (6Nakajima H. Ihle J.N. Blood. 2001; 98: 897-8905Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 36Truong B.T. Lee Y.J. Lodie T.A. Park D.J. Perrotti D. Watanabe N. Koeffler H.P. Nakajima H. Tenen D.G. Kogan S.C.

Investig. 1999; 103: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, overexpression of C/EBPϵ in immature 32D/WT cells inhibited G-CSF-dependent proliferation and survival. 32D/WT cells overexpressing C/EBPϵ showed morphological features of apoptosis when cultured in G-CSF, with no apparent evidence of terminal granulocytic differentiation. It is possible that although C/EBPϵ is highly expressed in late granulocytes and is required for terminal granulocytic differentiation (8Lekstrom-Himes J.A. Stem Cells (Dayton). 2001; 19: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), overexpression of C/EBPϵ in immature myeloid cells may have an adverse effect on granulocytic differentiation by causing accelerated apoptosis of differentiating cells. Thus, our data suggest that a key function of Gfi-1 in granulopoiesis, among others, is to control the expression of C/EBPϵ and that loss of Gfi-1 function may lead to overt overexpression of C/EBPϵ at early stages of granulocytic development, which may contribute to the premature apoptosis of differentiating myeloid cells. Despite its critical involvement in regulating the proliferation and survival of myeloid cells, whether Gfi-1 plays an active role in granulocytic differentiation remains to be determined. Our data show that the carboxyl terminus of the G-CSF receptor, involved in granulocytic differentiation, is required for Gfi-1 up-regulation by G-CSF. However, overexpression of Gfi-1 in 32D cells does not appear to have a positive effect on granulocytic differentiation induced by G-CSF. In fact, 32D/Gfi-1 cells appear to be morphologically less mature in G-CSF as compared with 32D/Puro cells, which may be attributable, at least in part, to the dramatic suppression of C/EBPϵ expression. These results suggest that Gfi-1 may not function to directly drive granulocytic differentiation. Further studies are needed to address whether Gfi-1 up-regulation is required for terminal granulocytic differentiation in response to G-CSF.

We synthesized DNA duplexes mimicking the U5 region and containing either 2′-modified nucleosides or 1,3-propanediol insertions and studied their interactions with HIV-1 integrase, using Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions as integrase cofactors.

The effects of nucleoside modifications at positions 5, 6, and especially 3 strongly depended on the cationic cofactor used. These effects were much more pronounced in the presence of Mg2+ than in the presence of Mn2+. Modifications of base pairs 7–9 affected 3′-end processing equally in the presence of both ions. Adenine from the 3rd bp is thought to form at least two hydrogen bonds with integrase that are crucial for specific DNA recognition. The complementary base, thymine, is not important for integrase activity.

Following reverse transcription, a DNA copy of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; LTR, long terminal repeat; IN, integrase; DTT, dithiothreitol; DAP, 2,6-diaminopurine. , RNA is integrated into the genome of infected cells. Integration is a prerequisite for viral replication and is catalyzed by the viral enzyme integrase (IN). IN binds to sequences located at the end of U3 and U5 parts of long terminal repeats (LTRs) of viral DNA and catalyzes the trimming, or 3′-end processing, of the terminal dinucleotide from the 3′-ends of both strands of the DNA. IN then mediates a strand transfer reaction that inserts the viral DNA into the host DNA. During this reaction, IN must bind simultaneously to viral and target DNA. However, IN interacts with these two DNA molecules in different ways as follows: binding to host DNA does not depend directly on host DNA sequence, whereas interaction with the viral DNA is a sequence-specific process. Nevertheless, the U5 and U3 sequences recognized by IN are not exactly identical. Strand transfer and 3′-end processing reactions may be carried out in vitro, using recombinant HIV IN, DNA duplexes mimicking U3 or U5 sequences of LTRs, and divalent metal ions, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+. However, the Mn2+- and Mg2+-dependent activities of IN are not equivalent, with lower specificity reported for Mn2+-dependent IN (1Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Engelman A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5908-5911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the inhibition of HIV-1 IN by compounds such as β-diketo acids, which interact with the active site of HIV-1 IN, is also metal-dependent (3Marchand C. Johnson A.A. Karki R.G. Pais G.C. Zhang X. Cowansage K. Patel T.A. Nicklaus M.C. Burke Jr., T.R. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The metal ion is coordinated within the IN catalytic core by two Asp residues (Asp-64 and Asp-116) and water molecules (4Goldgur Y. Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9150-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 5Asante-Appiah E. Seeholzer S.H. Skalka A.M. J. Biol.

These Asp residues are part of the D,D(35)E motif, a triad of invariant acidic amino acids found in all retroviral integrases (7Polard P. Chandler M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and ultimately required for catalytic activity (2Engelman A. Craigie R. J.

Bushman F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6715-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Binding of the metal cofactor by the amino acids of the D,D(35)E motif causes both local and long range conformational changes and the activation of IN (5Asante-Appiah E. Seeholzer S.H. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35078-35087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The IN catalytic core binds both the metal cofactor and the substrate. These conformational changes therefore influence the specificity of IN interactions with substrate DNA. Differences in the coordination properties of Mg2+ and Mn2+ions may result in different conformational changes in the IN catalytic core. This may account for differences in the specificity of HIV-1 IN interactions with substrate DNA (1Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Engelman A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5908-5911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibitors (3Marchand C. Johnson A.A.

Virol. 1996; 70: 2598-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As IN is more sensitive to the structure of molecules interacting with its catalytic core in the presence of magnesium ions, it has been suggested that the catalytic core of this molecule is more rigid in the presence of magnesium ions, as reported for other magnesium-dependent enzymes (1Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). IN has three domains: the N-terminal, catalytic, and C-terminal domains. The structure of each domain, and of two-domain fragments, has been determined by x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy (4Goldgur Y. Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9150-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 6Maignan S. Guilloteau J.P. Zhou-Liu Q. Clement-Mella C. Mikol V. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7333-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, neither the structure of the entire enzyme nor that of the IN-viral DNA complex has yet been determined. Cross-linking experiments have been used to study contacts between IN and viral DNA, and it has been found that the catalytic core (residues 50–212) and C-terminal domain (residues 213–288) are the principal areas involved in DNA binding. It has been shown that the Lys-159 residue of HIV-1 integrase may interact with the N-7 position of the third adenosine of the processed viral DNA strand (17Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and that Glu-152 may also interact with this adenosine (18Gerton J.L. Ohgi S. Olsen M. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5046-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gln-148 and Tyr-143 have been shown to bind to the terminal nucleotides of the processed strands of viral DNA, and the thymidine at position 7 interacts with amino acids from the C-terminal domain (1Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Glu-246 is also thought to be located near the C-2′ atom of the 2′-deoxyadenosine at position 7 in the unprocessed strand (19Gao K. Butler S.L. Bushman F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the protein/DNA interactions through which IN forms a stable and catalytically active complex with viral DNA are not yet completely understood. The third and fourth nucleotides of the processed strand of the viral DNA (the so-called conserved 5′-CA-3′) are important for 3′-end processing and strand transfer activities of IN (1Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20LaFemina R.L. Callahan P.L. Cordingley M.G. J.

It has been shown that the region from nucleotides 4 to 9 of the viral DNA is important for efficient 3′-end processing (22Katzman M. Sudol M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 9069-9073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mazumder A. Neamati N. Pilon A.A. Sunder S. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27330-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24van den Ent F.M.I. Vink C. Plasterk R.H.A. J.

Modification of the nucleosides at positions 5 and 6 in the processed strand significantly decreases 3′-end processing efficiency (1Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20LaFemina R.L. Callahan P.L. Cordingley M.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5624-5630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mazumder A. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2865-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that IN comes into contact with the heterocyclic bases of these nucleosides (26Wang T. Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of IN interactions with the processed and unprocessed strands of the HIV DNA remains to be elucidated. We therefore investigated the effect of the double-helix structure of viral DNA on HIV-1 integrase activity in the 3′-end processing reaction, as a means of identifying the structural features of the viral DNA determining the sequence specificity of its recognition and processing by IN. We synthesized a set of modified DNA duplexes, with sequences mimicking the U5 sequence of LTR of the viral DNA (U5 substrate). Nucleosides at various positions in the processed strand, the unprocessed strand, or both were replaced by a non-nucleoside insertion, 1,3-propanediol, or nucleosides containing modified sugar residues, 2′-aminonucleosides and 2′-O-methylnucleosides (Fig. 1). Because the conserved CA sequence adenosine is considered crucial for 3′-end processing and strand transfer activities, we also prepared a number of U5 substrate analogs in which the A/T pair was replaced by unpaired nucleotides in the 3rd position and a 2,6-diaminopurine replaced the conserved adenine. We have shown that IN probably recognizes the viral DNA by forming at least two hydrogen bonds with the adenine at position 3. The complementary base, thymine, does not interact with IN. We suggest that IN recognizes the fine structure of the sugar-phosphate backbone rather than heterocyclic bases at other positions. We also found that interactions with the unprocessed strand were more important for specific substrate recognition by IN than interactions with the processed strand. We showed that local destabilization of the A/T pair at position 3 was required for 3′-end processing, allowing such processing to occur even at internal positions of the U5 substrate within DNA. Finally, we studied IN/DNA interactions in the presence of Mn2+ and Mg2+ ions, investigating the differences in substrate recognition specificity in the presence of these two cofactors. We found that modification of the nucleosides in the 6th, 5th, and especially the 3rd positions influenced 3′-end processing more strongly in the presence of Mg2+ than presence of Mn2+ in the ions, whereas modification of base pairs 7–9 affected 3′-end processing equally in the presence of both ions. We suggest that positions 3–6 within the substrate DNA interact with the IN catalytic core that binds the metal cofactor. Oligonucleotide Synthesis—Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer and the standard β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite procedure. The resulting oligonucleotides were purified by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Oligonucleotides containing 2′-(3-aminopropionyl)amino-2′-deoxyarabinoadenosine (Fig. 1C) and 2′-amino-2′-deoxyuridine (Fig. 1B) were synthesized as described previously (27Zubin E.M. Antsypovich S.I. Oretskaya T.S. Romanova E.A. Volkov E.M. Tashlitsky V.N. Dolinnaya N.G. Shabarova Z.A. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 425-440Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Kuznetsova L.G. Volkov E.M. Romanova E.A. Tashlitsky V.N. Oretskaya T.S. Shabarova Z.A. Bioorg. Khim. 1991; 17: 1289-1291Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing 1,3-propanediol insertions (Fig. 1A) were synthesized using the commercially available Spacer C3 (Glen Research). An oligonucleotide containing 2,6-diaminopurine was synthesized using commercially available 2-amino-dA-CE phosphoramidite (Glen Research). Structures of all modified oligonucleotides were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight. Hybridization of oligonucleotides U5B and U5A (U5B being the processed strand) gave the wild-type U5 integrase substrate. The fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides U5B-fl (5′-fl-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT-3′) and U5A-fl (3′-fl-CACACCTTTTAGAGATCGTCA-5′) used for IN/DNA binding studies were synthesized as follows: oligonucleotide U5B, with an amino group at its 5′-end, and oligonucleotide U5A, with an amino group at its 3′-end, were synthesized with 5′-amino-modifier C6 reagent and 3′-amino-modifier C3 controlled pore glass (Glen Research), respectively. The resulting oligonucleotides were dissolved in a mixture of 60 μl of H2O, 20 μl of 1 m carbonate buffer (pH 11), and 80 μl of dimethylformamide. We then added 1 mg of fluorescein isothiocyanate to each solution. The mixtures were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 4–12 h, and 1 ml of 2% LiClO4 in acetone was added to precipitate the oligonucleotides. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography in ion pair mode, and the labeling efficiency was found to be greater than 90%. The conjugates were purified by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide denaturing gel, and the presence of fluorescein was confirmed by absorption spectroscopy. Synthesis of the Oligonucleotide Containing Acylated 2′-Amino Group—A solution of 10 nmol of 2′-aminouridine containing oligonucleotide (B-N7) in 100 μl of 1 m sodium borate buffer (pH 8.3) was supplemented with 100 μl of a 0.1 m solution of succinic anhydride in acetonitrile, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h (Fig. 2A). Acetonitrile was then evaporated, and the acylated oligonucleotide (B-N7-ac) was purified by gel filtration using NAP-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The efficiency of the amino group acylation determined by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis in ion pair mode was about 95%. The acylated oligonucleotide (B-N7-ac) was further used for 3′-processing experiments without additional purification. Integrase—Detergent-free recombinant integrase protein was produced in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (29Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thermal Denaturation Studies—Oligonucleotide duplexes (1 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), 7.5 mm MgCl2) were heated at 90 °C for 3 min and slowly cooled to 10 °C. Melting studies were carried out in Teflon-stoppered 1-cm path length quartz cells, using a Hitachi 100–20 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermal programmer. We monitored absorbance at 260 nm as the temperature was increased at a rate of 0.5 °C/min. Melting temperatures (Tm) were determined by fitting the first derivative of absorbance with respect to 1/T. Uncertainty in Tm was estimated to a precision of ±0.5 °C by repeating experiments. Preparation of 5′-Radiolabeled DNA Duplexes—For binding and processing assays, 10 pmol of the oligonucleotide U5B, or one of its modified analogs, was labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). T4 polynucleotide kinase was then inactivated by adding EDTA and heating at 65 °C for 5 min. The corresponding complementary unlabeled oligonucleotide, U5A, or its modified analog (10 pmol) was then added to each of the labeled oligonucleotides. The mixtures were heated at 90 °C for 3 min, and the DNA duplexes were allowed to anneal by slowly cooling to room temperature. DNA duplexes were purified using Micro Bio-Spin columns P-6 (Bio-Rad). 3′-End Processing Assay—The 3′-end processing reaction was carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm DTT, and 7.5 mm MnCl2 or MgCl2 using the IN substrate U5B/U5A or an analog containing modifications in one or both strands. 32P-Labeled DNA substrates (1.25 nm) were incubated in 20 μl of the buffer with 100 nm integrase at 37 °C. Aliquots were taken after 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 80 μl of a stop solution (7 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8)). IN was extracted in phenol/chloroform, and DNA fragments were precipitated with ethanol. The products were suspended in loading buffer (80% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol) and separated on 20% polyacrylamide denaturing gels. Gels were analyzed on a Storm 840™ PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with Image-Quant™ 4.1 software (Fig. 3). We fitted a nonlinear regression curve to the experimental data, and initial rates were calculated as the tangent to the kinetic curves for t = 0. Rate data for modified substrates were normalized to the initial rate of 3′-end processing of the natural U5 substrate. All 3′-end processing experiments were carried out at least three times; the standard deviation was between 5 and 10%. DNA Binding Assay—32P-Labeled duplexes (5 nm) were incubated with IN (10, 25, 50, 100, and 300 nm) in 10 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm DTT, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 5% (v/v) glycerol for 25 min at room temperature. A constant level of 20 mm NaCl was maintained in all reaction mixtures. The samples were then loaded on a 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gel containing 0.2% glycerol. Electrophoresis was carried out in a running buffer containing 50 mm Tris borate (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA for 2 h at 4°C (5.6 V/cm). A Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) was used for analysis and quantification. Steady-state Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy values were recorded on a Beacon 2000 apparatus (Panvera, Madison, WI) in a thermostated cell, at 37 °C for kinetics studies or 20 °C for competition experiments. For kinetics studies, fluorescein-labeled DNA duplexes (4 nm) (wild-type substrate or modified oligonucleotides) were added to a 200-μl buffered solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm DTT, and 7.5 mm MgCl2. IN-DNA complex formation was then triggered by adding IN (200 nm final concentration). A constant level of 20 mm NaCl was maintained in all reaction mixtures. Fluorescence anisotropy values were then recorded, and the binding curves were used to determine the pseudo first-order binding rate constant, kon = k1 × [IN] (where k1 is the second-order binding rate constant). A single-exponential model was fitted to the data for DNA-IN complex formation. For competition experiments, fluorescein-labeled DNA duplexes (2 nm) were first incubated with various concentrations of unlabeled DNA duplexes (either unmodified or modified oligonucleotides) in a buffered solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm DTT, 20 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. IN (120 nm final concentration) was then added, and steady-state anisotropy values (r) were recorded after equilibrium was reached. The r value corresponding to free fluorescein-labeled DNA was subtracted from the measured r value to give Δr. Finally, Δr values were plotted against competitor concentration to determine apparent Kd (concentration of unlabeled DNA decreasing the initial Δr value by 50%). This study aimed to identify the elements of viral DNA structure determining the sequence specificity of interactions with HIV-1 IN. We synthesized 21-mer DNA duplexes containing modifications inducing local distortions in the DNA double helix (27Zubin E.M. Antsypovich S.I. Oretskaya T.S. Romanova E.A. Volkov E.M. Tashlitsky V.N.

Oligonucleotides mimicking the HIV-1 U5 viral DNA end were synthesized with single modifications at a particular residue (Fig. 1). Modified substrate analogs contained only one modification in the processed (U5B) strand, the unprocessed (U5A) strand, or both. The native nucleosides in the U5 substrate were replaced by non-nucleoside insertions (1,3-propanediol residues), 2′-aminonucleosides, or 2′-O-methyluridine. It has been reported that the most important nucleosides for integration are those at positions 3–9 of the processed strand (17Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 20LaFemina R.L. Callahan P.L. Cordingley M.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5624-5630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sherman P.A.

Balakrishnan M. Jonsson C.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, nucleoside mutations distal to the LTR end (positions 10–13) have also been found to affect 3′-end processing, but only in the presence of Mg2+ ions (1Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We assessed the importance of various nucleosides within the LTR sequence, by making modifications at positions 3, 5–9, and 12 of the U5 substrate (Fig. 1). Position 4 was not modified because the modification of this base pair has been shown to inhibit 3′-end processing (20LaFemina R.L. Callahan P.L. Cordingley M.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5624-5630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sherman P.A. Dickson M.L. Fyfe J.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3593-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24van den Ent F.M.I. Vink C.

Modifications at Position 12—We investigated the influence of U5 substrate modifications on the ability of IN to mediate 3′-end processing. We found that replacement of the nucleosides at position 12 by the non-nucleoside insertion P did not affect IN activity in presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions (supplemental Table S2). These nucleosides therefore do not form contacts with IN that are important for catalytic activity. By contrast, modifications at other sites on the U5 substrate significantly influenced the processing rate. Modifications at Positions 7–9—Both non-nucleoside insertions and nucleoside modifications at position 9 decreased the 3′-end processing rate (Table 1). Similar effects were observed for modifications of the processed and unprocessed strands. Non-nucleoside insertions decreased the reaction rate more strongly than the insertion of a modified nucleoside. The 3′-end processing rate was lower if both substrate strands were modified. Therefore, nucleosides at position 9 in both strands of the DNA are involved in interactions with IN.TABLE 1The relative initial rates of 3′-end processing of the duplexes containing modifications at positions 7-9Initial processing ratePositionCofactorU5B strandU5A strandBoth strandsPUNUMPaANPUN/aAN7Mg2+1.10 ± 0.091.81 ± 0.210.91 ± 0.110.43 ± 0.060.73 ± 0.090.69 ± 0.081.58 ± 0.12Mn2+0.83 ± 0.071.42 ± 0.120.82 ± 0.100.41 ± 0.050.57 ± 0.080.44 ± 0.061.24 ± 0.108Mg2+0.92 ± 0.09—a— indicates 3′-end processing assay was not carried out.—0.44 ± 0.06—0.79 ± 0.09—Mn2+0.93 ± 0.09——0.68 ± 0.08—0.81 ± 0.11—9Mg2+0.62 ± 0.080.94 ± 0.08—0.61 ± 0.070.79 ± 0.080.53 ± 0.070.67 ± 0.08Mn2+0.59 ± 0.070.92 ± 0.10—0.62 ± 0.080.83 ± 0.100.48 ± 0.070.54 ± 0.07a — indicates 3′-end processing assay was not carried out. Open table in a new tab For positions 7 and 8, we found that all nucleoside modifications on the unprocessed strand, U5A, decreased the reaction rate (Table 1). By contrast, non-nucleoside insertions in the processed strand, U5B, had no effect on 3′-end processing rate (Table 1). Similar results were obtained if the thymidine at position 7 was replaced by 2′-O-methyluridine. Therefore, IN interacts principally with the nonprocessed strand of the U5 substrate at positions 7 and 8. It should be especially noted that replacing position 7 of the U5B strand with 2′-aminouridine increased 3′-end processing rate (Table 1). This can be explained by the formation of an additional contact between the amino group of 2′-aminouridine and an amino acid inside IN.

We verified this by treating an oligonucleotide containing 2′-aminouridine at position 7 (B-N7) with succinic anhydride, to give an oligonucleotide containing a carboxyl group (B-N7-ac) (Fig. 2A). We found that the 3′-processing rates of the duplex with this carboxyl group (B-N7-ac/U5A) and nonmodified U5 substrate were the same (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the increase in the 3′-processing rate of the substrate containing 2′-aminonucleoside at the processed strand position 7 is because of the presence of the 2′-amino group. This processin"

This process involves the formation of a tight complex of peptide N-glycanase with Rad23 in yeast and the orthologous HR23 proteins in mammals. In addition to its function in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, HR23 is also involved in DNA repair, where it plays an important role in damage recognition in complex with the xeroderma pigmentosum group C protein. To characterize the dual role of HR23, we have determined the high resolution crystal structure of the mouse peptide N-glycanase catalytic core in complex with the xeroderma pigmentosum group C binding domain from HR23B. Peptide N-glycanase features a large cleft between its catalytic cysteine protease core and zinc binding domain. Opposite the zinc binding domain is the HR23B-interacting region, and surprisingly, the complex interface is fundamentally different from the orthologous yeast peptide N-glycanase-Rad23 complex. Different regions on both proteins are involved in complex formation, revealing an amazing degree of divergence in the interaction between two highly homologous proteins. Furthermore, the mouse peptide N-glycanase-HR23B complex mimics the interaction between xeroderma pigmentosum group C and HR23B, thereby providing a first structural model of how the two proteins interact within the nucleotide excision repair cascade in higher eukaryotes.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Defects in the ER-associated degradation system have been associated with many diseases including α-1 antitrypsin deficiency, cystic fibrosis, neurodegenerative disorders, tyrosinase deficiency, and cancer (3Fu L.

PNGase hydrolyzes the β-aspartylglycosylamine bond of N-linked glycoproteins, which facilitates their degradation by the proteasome (9Suzuki T. Park H. Lennarz W.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). PNGase is highly conserved from yeast to human, supporting its functional significance. In addition to the catalytic core, in higher eukaryotes PNGase contains one additional domain each at the N and C terminus, which may function as binding partners for other proteins (10Park H. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).PNGase closely associates with the proteasome by either directly binding to components of the proteasome or through its interaction with HR23A/HR23B, the mammalian homologs of Rad23 in yeast (10Park H.

HR23 participates in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by interacting with ubiquitin and components of the 26 S proteasome (12Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Curr.

Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). HR23 is also involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway and forms a tight complex with xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC), the ortholog of yeast Rad4 in higher eukaryotes (14Ng J.M. Vermeulen W. van der Horst G.T. Bergink S. Sugasawa K. Vrieling H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1630-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 15Sugasawa K. Masutani C. Uchida A.

The XPC ·HR23B complex is involved in damage recognition and binds to damaged DNA during the early stages of the NER pathway, thereby initiating global genome NER and recruiting TFIIH to the site of damage (16Sugasawa K.

The precise role of HR23 in NER is not clear, but it was shown to stabilize XPC and/or prevent its proteasomal destruction (14Ng J.M. Vermeulen W. van der Horst G.T. Bergink S. Sugasawa K.

Interestingly, bioinformatics studies demonstrated that both XPC/Rad4 and PNGase belong to the transglutaminase family (20Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1627-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and, hence, share a common fold. The interaction between PNGase and HR23 further strengthens the proposed relationship between the proteasome-dependent protein degradation and NER pathways (21Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 22Ortolan T.G. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Madura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and also provides first insights into how XPC interacts with HR23 to form the damage recognition complex.HR23 contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and two ubiquitin-associated domains. The stretch of residues responsible for XPC binding (XPCB) was mapped to a highly conserved region between the two ubiquitin-associated domains (23Masutani C. Araki M. Sugasawa K. van der Spek P.J. Yamada A. Uchida A. Maekawa T. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6915-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The solution structure of the XPCB domain reveals that it consists of five amphipathic helices featuring hydrophobic patches on the surface that have been predicted to be involved in protein-protein interactions (24Kamionka M. Feigon J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2370-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Kim B. Ryu K.S. Kim H.J. Cho S.J. Choi B.S. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2467-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This agrees with previous studies indicating that the interaction between HR23 and XPC is predominantly hydrophobic (26Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). We present here the crystal structure of the mouse PNGase (mPNGase) core domain in complex with the XPCB domain of mouse HR23B (mHR23B) and propose a similar interaction between XPC and the HR23 proteins in mammals.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The DNA sequence encoding residues 165-450 (core domain) of mPNGase was amplified by PCR from full-length (residues 1-651) pET28a-mPNG1 (10Park H. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and cloned into the pET21b vector using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The cDNA encoding mHR23B was cloned into the pET21b vector using the same sites (pET21b-mHR23B). The coding sequence of the XPCB domain (residues 273-332) of mHR23B was amplified from pET21b-mHR23B and inserted into the pTXB1 vector (NdeI/SapI) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Full-length and core domains of mPNGase and full-length mHR23B were overexpressed and purified as described previously (27Biswas S. Katiyar S. Li G. Zhou X. Lennarz W.J. Schindelin H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The XPCB domain was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) at 15 °C overnight by inducing a mid-log culture with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The protein was purified by chitin affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs) as well as size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) column and was concentrated to 8 mg/ml.Crystallization and Structure Determination—The mPNGase core domain and the XPCB domain were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio, and a total protein concentration of 9.5 mg/ml was used for crystallization. Crystals of the complex were obtained by vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 28-32% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 0.2 m sodium acetate. The crystals reached their final size of 0.2 mm in each dimension within 5-10 days. The crystals belong to the monoclinic space group C2 with a = 97.3 Å, b = 52.4 Å, c = 81.3 Å, and β = 114° and contain one complex in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering using mercury, platinum, and gold derivatives. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals in crystallization buffer with 1 mm ethyl mercury thiosalicylate (4 h), 1 mm K2[PtCN4] (4 h), or 1mm KAuCN2 (24 h). Cocrystallization of the protein complex with 5 mm concentrations of the inhibitor Z-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Sigma-Aldrich) was conducted under similar conditions. The inhibitor-bound crystals were isomorphous with the native crystals, and the structure was solved using isomorphous replacement. After transfer into a cryoprotectant containing 20% glycerol, the crystals were cryocooled and stored in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data of the native, inhibitorsoaked and heavy atom-derivatized crystals were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode x-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA and equipped with confocal multilayer optics and a Rigaku RAXIS-IV++ detector. Due to its strong diffraction, a second high resolution dataset to 1.85 Å was collected for the gold derivative, which was used for refinement.Diffraction data were processed using the HKL software (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Jr-Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Phases at 3.0 Å were calculated with Solve (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) and Resolve (30Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar), and the model was manually built in O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). The coordinates of XPCB could easily be fitted into the initial maps together with helical segments of the mPNGase core domain. The partial model was refined in an iterative process, allowing the gradual incorporation of most residues in the resulting electron density maps. The model was refined at a resolution of 1.85 Å with REFMAC (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar), and water molecules were added with ARP (33Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). All data between 20 Å and the respective high resolution limits were included. Additional calculations were done with the CCP4 suite (34Collaborative Computational Project, N.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar).Protein-Protein Interaction Studies—mPNGase and mHR23B proteins were mixed in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 250 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) analytical size exclusion chromatography column was calibrated with a molecular weight marker kit (MW-GF-200, Sigma). Individual proteins and the protein complexes were analyzed on the column, and the elution profiles were monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm, or 215 nm in the case of XPCB. The corresponding peak fractions were visualized either on 12% SDS-PAGE or 12% Tricine SDS-PAGE gels.Calorimetric titrations were carried out with a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal) at 25 °C. Proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of buffer C with 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the solutions were thoroughly degassed before each titration. Purified PNGase (10-25 μm) in the sample cell was titrated with 100-250 μm concentrations of either full-length yRAD23 or full-length mHR23B or the mXPCB domain. The data were processed with the MicroCal Origin 7.0 software. By fitting the data to a single-site binding model, the binding stoichiometry, apparent Kd, and binding enthalpy ΔH were determined. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were carried out in duplicate.Sequence Alignment and Modeling Studies—The sequence alignment of the common RAD4-related sequences from mPNGase (305-445) and the XPC proteins from mouse (499-656), human (508-663), and Drosophila melanogaster (933-1091) was generated using ClustalW (35Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar) and manually adjusted. The alignment and the mPNGase crystal structure were used to construct homology models of the corresponding region of human XPC using Modeler (36Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10384) Google Scholar). Forty initial models were built, and the one with the lowest objective energy was selected.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe mPNGase Core Domain Interacts with the XPCB Domain of mHR23B—The mPNGase protein contains a core domain, which is highly similar (42% sequence identity) to yeast PNGase (yPNGase), as well as N- and C-terminal extensions not present in yeast (Fig. 1A). The mPNGase core also shares similarities with the DNA repair proteins XPC/RAD4 (20Anantharaman V. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1627-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); for example, PNGase and XPC from mouse are 29% identical within a conserved region, and both proteins form a complex with mHR23, the homolog of yRAD23 (10Park H. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Masutani C. Araki M. Sugasawa K. van der Spek P.J. Yamada A. Uchida A. Maekawa T. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6915-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Due to the sequence homology between the core of PNGase and XPC, it is likely that the mPNGase core domain interacts with mHR23 in a fashion similar to that of XPC interacting with mHR23. The XPCB region in mHR23B has been mapped to a largely helical region (23Masutani C. Araki M. Sugasawa K. van der Spek P.J. Yamada A. Uchida A. Maekawa T. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6915-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that this region of mHR23B also interacts with the core domain of mPNGase. Based on secondary structure predictions and sequence alignments, the core domain of mPNGase (mPNGase-core, residues 165-450) and the XPCB fragment of mHR23B (mHR23B-XPCB, residues 273-332) were cloned, and the corresponding proteins were overexpressed and purified to homogeneity.The in vitro interaction between mPNGase and mHR23B was investigated by analytical size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1B). In agreement with previous studies (10Park H. Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11163-11168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we found that full-length mPNGase interacts with full-length mHR23B in a 1:1 molar ratio. Additional chromatographic assays revealed that the core but neither the N-terminal (1-164) nor C-terminal (451-651) fragments of mPNGase, binds to mHR23B (data not shown). More significantly, we were able to show that the mPNGase core interacts with the XPCB domain of mHR23B (Fig. 1). The complex eluted from the column at a higher apparent molecular mass than the mPNGase core, and when analyzed by SDS-PAGE, this peak contained both proteins (Fig. 1B and inset). The complex is very stable (see below) and was subsequently utilized in our structural studies.To further characterize the interaction between mPNGase and mHR23B, ITC experiments were performed (Fig. 1C) by titrating the mPNGase core with mHR23B-XPCB at 25 °C. Analysis of the exothermic binding curve showed that the best fit is obtained with a one site binding model, yielding a binding stoichiometry of 1:1 and an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 65 nm. The subunit stoichiometry is consistent with the chromatographic and crystallographic studies (see below). These results support the hypothesis that the mPNGase core domain and the XPCB domain of mHR23B mediate the interaction between mPNGase and mHR23B. A very similar binding affinity was determined in additional ITC experiments for the complex between the mPNGase core and full-length mHR23B (Kd = 22 nm), indicating that almost all of the binding determinants on mHR23B reside in the XPCB domain. The 3-fold increase in the dissociation constant between the XPCB domain and full-length mHR23B corresponds to a free energy change of less than 3 kJ/mol, which is very similar to the value of RT at this temperature. Furthermore, ITC experiments with full-length yeast PNGase and full-length yeast Rad23 revealed a Kd of 24 nm, which is essentially identical to the corresponding complex from mouse.Overall Structure of the mPNGase-XPCB Domain Complex—The crystal structure of the core domain of mPNGase in complex with the XPCB domain of mHR23B was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (Table 1) and was refined at 1.85 Å resolution (Table 2) to an R-factor of 0.189 (Rfree = 0.239). The final model contains residues 273-333 of the mHR23B XPCB domain and residues 165-450 of mPNGase and all six C-terminal histidine residues from the affinity tag. The stereochemistry of the model is very good; 99% of the residues are located in the most favored and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram. While these studies were in progress, the crystal structure of yPNGase in complex with the XPCB domain of yRAD23 was solved (37Lee J.H. Choi J.M. Lee C. Yi K.J. Cho Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9144-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although the structures of the individual components are similar, complex formation is fundamentally different (see below), and thus, the structure of the complex studied by us represents the first detailed view into the interaction between these two proteins in avian and mammalian species.TABLE 1Data collection and structure solutionNativeMercuryPlatinumGoldGold-HRaDiffraction data of the gold derivative recollected at high resolution.Z-VADResolution limits (Å)50-2.250-2.450-2.350-2.150-1.8550-2.26Rsym0.0730.0620.0650.0510.0620.055(0.391)(0.246)(0.338)(0.157)(0.400)(0.216)Mean redundancy8.31.81.72.24.52.34Completeness0.9560.7820.7370.9460.9090.835(0.641)(0.252)(0.071)(0.596)(0.209)(0.492)<I/αI>29.0 (2.5)12.0 (1.9)12.4 (1.4)15.2 (4.2)15.5 (2.0)18.4 (2.5)Heavy atom sites433Phasing power0.810.330.30Centric R factor0.670.780.77FOM0.42a Diffraction data of the gold derivative recollected at high resolution.

The zinc binding domain contains a three-stranded β-sheet (S2-S4) with the zinc located at the far end of this domain. In addition a third, very small β-sheet (S1 and S5) is located at the interface between the zinc binding and catalytic domains. The XPCB association motif is located on the opposite side of the zinc binding domain and comprises the C-terminal α-helices H11 and H12.FIGURE 2Overall structure of the complex.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Those enzymes feature a catalytic triad composed of cysteine, histidine, and aspartate residues (Cys-306, His-333, and Asp-350 in mPNGase) in the “cysteine protease” motif consisting of an α-helix, H8 in mPNGase, and four antiparallel β-strands, S6-S9 in mPNGase (38Sinclair J.C. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The catalytic core of mPNGase more closely resembles that of N-acetyltransferase and transglutaminase, although they catalyze reactions in the opposite direction, with N-acetyltransferase and transglutaminase resulting in amide formation and PNGase acting as an amidase.The Active Site—Recently, Z-VAD, a potential caspase inhibitor, was reported to inhibit PNGase by covalently attacking the active site cysteine (40Misaghi S. Pacold M.E. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. Korbel G.A. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1677-1687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Z-VAD features a Val-Ala-Asp tripeptide with a fluoromethyl ketone group at the C-terminal end. To illustrate the inhibition mechanism and possibly the catalytic mechanism of PNGase, we determined the structure of the Z-VAD-modified mPNGase ·XPCB domain complex at 2.3 Å resolution (Figs. 2, B and C and supplemental Fig. S1). The overall structure of the complex was not perturbed after binding of the inhibitor as evidenced by a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of the Cα atoms by only 0.24 Å compared with the complex in the absence of the inhibitor. The complete structure of the inhibitor was defined based on the electron density maps (Fig. 2C). As expected, the reactive end of the inhibitor is covalently linked to the active site cysteine (Cys-306). In addition, the inhibitor is bound to the enzyme via two hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions involving residues Arg-291 and Arg-305 of PNGase and the aspartate side chain of the inhibitor, which is in good agreement with the inhibitor-bound structure of yeast PNGase (37Lee J.H.

Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar).

J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Only a minority of PH domains are capable of binding to lipids with high affinity and specificity. Some PH domains are known to be weak, nonspecific membrane phosphoinositide binders (6Yu J.W. Mendrola J.M. Audhya A. Singh S. Keleti D. DeWald D.B. Murray D. Emr S.D. Lemmon M.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), whereas others interact with proteins (e.g. the PH domain of the β-adrenergic receptor) (7Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functions of the majority of PH domains are unknown (6Yu J.W. Mendrola J.M. Audhya A. Singh S. Keleti D. DeWald D.B. Murray D. Emr S.D. Lemmon M.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Split PH domains represent a unique subclass of PH domains that are characterized by insertions of one or several autonomously folded protein modules in the middle of PH domain sequences. Split PH domains are also found in various proteins, including the second messenger generating enzymes phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), the syntrophin scaffold proteins (8Yan J. Wen W. Xu W. Long J.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Zhang M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3985-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the Rock1 family Ser/Thr kinases, and the actin filament-based molecular motor myosin X (9Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent biochemical and structural studies showed that the split PH domain of α-syntrophin folds into a canonical PH domain fold with or without the PDZ domain insertion. It was further demonstrated that the PDZ domain insertion functions synergistically with the split PH domain in binding to phosphoinositol lipids (8Yan J. Wen W. Xu W. Long J.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Zhang M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3985-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Little is known about the structural and biochemical properties of the split PH domains other than what has been demonstrated in α-syntrophin. Phospholipase C (PLC) hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate to produce the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol. There are as many as 12 different PLC gene products found in mammalian cells that can be grouped into five subfamilies: β (β1-β4), γ (γ1 and γ2), δ (δ1-δ4), ϵ, and ζ (10Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Nikolaidis N. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 688-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev.

All PLC isoforms are modular proteins invariably containing from their N-terminal to C-terminal ends a PH domain, catalytic X and Y domains, and a C2 domain. Among the various isozymes of PLC, members of the γ subfamily are structurally distinct in that the catalytic X and Y domains are separated by an ∼450-residue insertion. The center of the insertion sequences in each PLC-γ isozyme consists of two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and an SH3 domain, and the two ends of the SH2SH2SH3 supramodule are flanked by the split halves of a PH domain (Fig. 1A). Extensive studies in the past demonstrated that in addition to docking the enzymes to various receptors and adaptor proteins, the SH2 and SH3 domains also directly regulate the catalytic activities of PLC-γ (11Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 12Carpenter G. Ji Q. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Poulin B. Sekiya F. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4276-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An emerging feature of the PLC-γ family isozyme is that many PLC-γ cellular functions are not dependent on lipase activity. For example, the mitogenic activity of PLC-γ1 was not affected by a lipase-inactive mutation (14Smith M.R. Liu Y.L. Matthews N.T. Rhee S.G. Sung W.K. Kung H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6554-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) but could be inhibited by the SH3 domain of the enzyme (15Smith M.R. Liu Y.L. Kim S.R. Bae Y.S. Kim C.G. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. Kung H.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of PLC-γ1 was found to contain guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity specifically for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase enhancer small GTPase PIKE (16Ye K. Aghdasi B. Luo H.R. Moriarity J.L. Wu F.Y. Hong J.J. Hurt K.J. Bae S.S. Suh P.G. Snyder S.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of the SH3 domain may be associated with the lipase-independent mitogenic activity of the enzyme. Another example of lipase-independent activity of PLC-γ is the regulation of agonist-induced Ca2+ entry via the TRPC3 calcium channel (17Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Ford D.L. Hurt K.J. Bae S.S. Suh P.G. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Gill D.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors showed that the lipase-inactive mutant of PLC-γ1 functions as effectively as the wild-type enzyme in augmenting agonist-induced Ca2+ entry in PC12 cells. It was further found that a fragment of the enzyme containing the SH3 domain and the C-terminal half of the split PH domain of PLC-γ1 (PLCγ1-PHC) can directly associate with TRPC3. Very recently, the same research group showed that PLCγ1-PHC is solely responsible for direct binding to a short fragment of TRPC3 located at its N-terminal end (18van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Sharma S. Barrow R.K. Kornberg M. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Nature. 2005; 434: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). More significantly, the authors suggested that the PLCγ1-PHC-binding segment of TRPC3 represents a complementary partial PH domain “hidden” in the ion channel. They demonstrated that binding of the two partial PH domain fragments from PLC-γ1 and TRPC3 forms a functional “PH domain” capable of binding to specific lipids and regulating the surface expression of the TRPC3 ion channel. Given the potentially wide distribution of split PH domains in diverse proteins and enzymes, the work presented by van Rossum et al. (18van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Sharma S. Barrow R.K. Kornberg M. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Nature. 2005; 434: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) suggests a novel mode of function of many PH domains (19Lemmon M.A. Cell. 2005; 120: 574-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To advance this important hypothesis, it is critical to know whether the two halves of the split PH domain in PLCγ1 can fold into a canonical PH domain structure; whether PLCγ1-PHC alone can stably exist in solution for binding to a complementing partial PH domain from another protein such as TRPC3; and whether the complex formed by two fragments from PLCγ1 and TRPC3 (or PLCγ1 and translational elongation factor 1α (20Chang J.-S. Seok H. Kwon T.-K. Min D.S. Ahn B.-H. Lee Y.H. Suh J.-W. Kim J.-W. Iwashita S. Omori A. Ichinose S. Numata O. Seo J.-K. Oh Y.-S. Suh P.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19697-19702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) or from other proteins with split PH domains can indeed assume a PH domain-like fold. In this study, we determined the solution structure of the split PH domain of PLC-γ1. We further showed that the insertion of the SH2SH2SH3 domain does not affect the structure of the split PH domain of PLC-γ1. Finally, we characterized potential interactions of PLCγ1-PHC with the hypothetical hidden PHN fragment from TRPC3. Protein Expression and Purification—The joined PHN-PHC domain (residues 489-547 and 851-933), PHC fragment (residues 851-933), and the PHN-SH2SH2SH3-PHC (residues 489-933) of rat PLC-γ1 were cloned into a modified version of the pET32a vector (21Feng W. Fan J.S. Jiang M. Shi Y.W. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41140-41146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The joined PHN-PHC domain contains an 8-residue protease 3C recognition sequence (“LEVLFQGP”) at the joint site of the two halves of the PH domain. The human TRPC3 fragment (residues 1-52) and the PLC-γ1 PHN fragment (residues 489-547) were cloned into the pET32a vector. GST-fused PHN-PHC, the PHC fragment, and the SH3-PHC fragment (residues 794-933) were cloned into pGEX4T-1 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). Bacterial cells harboring each fusion protein expression plasmid were grown at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at 16 °C overnight. Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled proteins were prepared by growing bacteria in M9 medium containing NH4Cl with or without 13C6-glucose. The Histagged fusion proteins were purified under native conditions using an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography. The remaining small amount of contaminant proteins was removed by size-exclusion chromatography. The GST-fused proteins were purified using GSH-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography. Lipid Binding Assay—Liposomes consisting of total bovine brain lipids were prepared by resuspending brain lipid extracts (Folch fraction I, Sigma B1502, which contains ∼10% phosphatidylinositol lipids) at 2 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein sample (5-10 μm) was incubated with 0.6 mg/ml liposomes in 40 μl of buffer for 15 min at room temperature and then spun at 65,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.1 rotor. The supernatants were removed for determination of proteins not bound to liposomes. The pellets were washed twice with the same buffer and brought up to the same volume as the supernatant. The supernatant and the pellet proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Pull-down Experiments—Purified GST-PHC, GST-PHN-PHC, or GST-SH3-PHC (10 μg) was mixed with purified Trx-TRPC3-(1-52) (100 μg) with or without the presence of 0.5 mg/ml of brain liposome. Then the complexes were pelleted with 30 μl of fresh GSH-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The pelleted beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and subsequently boiled with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples contained ∼1.0 mm of the PHN-PHC tandem in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, in 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 99.9% D2O. NMR spectra were acquired at 35 °C on Varian Inova 500- and 750-MHz spectrometers each equipped with an actively z-gradient shielded triple resonance probe. Backbone and side chain resonance assignments of the protein were obtained by standard heteronuclear correlation experiments (22Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 23Kay L.E. Gardner K.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Nonaromatic, nonexchangeable side chain resonances were assigned using HCCH-TOCSY experiments. The side chains of aromatics were assigned by standard 1H two-dimensional TOCSY/NOESY experiments. Structure Calculations—Approximate interproton distance restraints were derived from the NOESY spectra (a 1H two-dimensional homonuclear NOESY, a 15N-separated NOESY, and a 13C-separated NOESY). The NOEs were grouped into three distance ranges as follows: 1.8-2.7 Å (1.8-2.9 Å for NOEs involving NH protons), 1.8-3.3 Å (1.8-3.5 Å for NOEs involving NH protons), and 1.8-5.0 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, and weak NOEs, respectively. Hydrogen bonding restraints were generated from the standard secondary structure of the protein based on the NOE patterns and backbone secondary chemical shifts. The backbone dihedral angle restraints (φ and ψ angles) were derived from the chemical shift analysis program TALOS (24Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Structures were calculated using the program CNS (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Figures were generated using MOLMOL (26Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar), MOLSCRIPT (27Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), and Raster3D (28Merritt E. Murphy M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). NMR Titration—NMR-based interaction studies were by recording 1H-15N HSQC spectra of performed 15N-labeled protein samples (∼0.2 mm) with or without addition of their respective binding partners at natural abundance. The N-terminal SH2 domain-binding phosphotyrosine peptide (D{pY}IIPLPDP) was commercially synthesized (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ). The buffer condition was identical to that used in the samples for the structural determination of the split PH proteins. The Split PH Domain of PLC-γ1 Adopts a Stable Fold—Several approaches were used to assess whether the two split halves of the PH domain of PLC-γ1 (referred to as PHN and PHC) can directly interact with each other to form a stable structure. First, we deleted the SH2SH2SH3 insert (residues 548-850 in rat PLC-γ1) from the PHN-SH2SH2SH3-PHC supramodule, resulting in a fusion protein with the two halves of the split PH domain connected directly (i.e. PHN-PHC). The recombinant PHN-PHC was eluted at a molecular mass indicative of a stable monomer when analyzed by analytical gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). The well dispersed 1H, 15N HSQC spectrum indicates that the joined PHN-PHC is well folded (Fig. 1B, black dots). It is possible that the covalent linkage of PHN and PHC may artificially induce folding of the linked protein. To address this possibility, in the middle of the linking sequence of PHN-PHC, we inserted an 8-residue peptide fragment that can be cleaved by protease 3C. Digestion of PHN-PHC with protease 3C produces two fragments with molecular masses corresponding to PHN and PHC, respectively (Fig. 1C). The NMR spectrum of the protease 3C-cleaved PHN-PHC is essentially identical to that of the uncleaved protein (Fig. 1B), indicating that the covalent linkage between PHN and PHC is dispensable to the folding of the split PH domain in PLC-γ1. Furthermore, both the joined and cleaved PHN-PHC showed excellent thermostability, as the proteins remained well folded in the NMR tubes at temperature as high as 50 °C (supplemental Fig. 1). Structure of the Split PH Domain of PLC-γ1—To determine whether the split PH domain of PLC-γ1 folds into a canonical PH domain structure, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the joined PHN-PHC by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The PHN and PHC fragments fold together to form a canonical PH domain structure containing seven β-strands and one C-terminal α-helix. As in the split PH domain of α-syntrophin (8Yan J. Wen W. Xu W. Long J.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Zhang M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3985-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the PHN half is composed of three β-strands (β1-β3), and the PHC half contains the remaining four β-strands (β4-β7) and the C-terminal α-helix. Inserted at the β3/β4-loop of the PH domain is a 56-residue flexible linker. The flexibility of this 56-residue linker is confirmed by a lack of any detectable medium, long range NOEs and negative backbone amide 1H, 15N NOE values (data not shown). In the native PLC-γ1, the β3/β4-loop of the split PH domain also contains a 300-residue SH2SH2SH3 tandem insertion in the middle of the loop.TABLE 1Structural statistics for the family of 15 structures of the joined PHN-PHC domainDistance restraintsIntraresidue (i - j = 0)837Sequential (|i - j| = 1)501Medium range (2 ≤ |i - j| ≤4)220Long range (|i - j| >5)465Hydrogen bonds62Total2085Dihedral angle restraintsΦ31Ψ29Total60Mean r.m.s. deviations from the experimental restraintsDistance (Å)0.008 ± 0.000Dihedral angle (°)0.003 ± 0.005Mean r.m.s. deviations from idealized covalent geometryBond (Å)0.001 ± 0.000Angle (°)0.291 ± 0.004Improper (°)0.125 ± 0.004Mean energies (kcal mol−1)ENOEaThe final values of the square-well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol−1 Å−2 and 200 kcal mol−1 rad−2, respectively.10.26 ± 0.44EcdihaThe final values of the square-well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol−1 Å−2 and 200 kcal mol−1 rad−2, respectively.0.00 ± 0.00EL-J−368 ± 19Ramachandran plotbThe program Procheck (40) was used to assess the overall quality of the structures.Residues 1-33 and 90-150% residues in the most favorable regions74.6Additional allowed regions20.0Generously allowed regions4.6Disallowed regions0.8Atomic r.m.s. difference (Å)cThe precision of the atomic coordinates is defined as the average r.m.s. difference between 15 final structures and the mean coordinates of the protein.Residues 1-11, 16-31, 91-118, and 125-147Backbone heavy atoms (N, Cα, and C′)0.45Heavy atoms0.93a The final values of the square-well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol−1 Å−2 and 200 kcal mol−1 rad−2, respectively.b The program Procheck (40Laskowski R.A.

Open table in a new tab Sequence alignment analysis showed that the split PH domains of PLCγ1 are highly conserved throughout evolution (Fig. 3A). When compared with a number of PH domains that bind to phosphoinositide head groups with high affinities (29Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), the split PH domain of PLCγ1 lacks a number of critical residues necessary for binding to phosphoinositides. For example, the phosphoinositide-binding PH domains share a signature motif with conserved positively charged amino acid residues, “KXn(K/R)XR,” where the first Lys locates at the penultimate position of the β1 strand, and the “(K/R)XR” sequence corresponds to residues 2-4 of the β2 strand (Fig. 3A) (32Lietzke S.E.

Cell. 2000; 6: 373-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These conserved basic residues play critical roles in binding to negatively charged phosphate groups from the head groups of phosphoinositides (see Fig. 3B for an example). In contrast, the penultimate residue in the β1 strand is a Leu instead of a Lys, and the second and the fourth residues in the β2 strand are Tyr and His, respectively, in the split PH domains of PLC-γ1. Because all three positively charged residues in the otherwise phosphoinositol lipid-binding signature motif are absent, we predicted that the split PH domain of PLC-γ1 is not likely to function as a lipid binding module. To test this hypothesis, we assayed the binding of the joined PHN-PHC domain of PLCγ1 to liposomes prepared from total bovine brain lipids. As predicted, the split PH domain of PLC-γ1 showed no detectable binding to brain liposomes (Fig. 3C). We further demonstrated that the PHN-SH2SH2SH3-PHC supramodule of PLCγ1 does not bind to brain liposomes either, indicating that the SH2SH2SH3 insertion does not alter the lipid binding property of the split PH domain (Fig. 3C). The SH2SH2SH3 insertion is known to play important roles in regulating the enzyme activities of PLC-γ1. It has been suggested, based on indirect experimental evidence, that the insertion may change the structure of the split PH domain, thereby influencing the assembly of the catalytic X and Y boxes (10Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Nikolaidis N. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 688-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). We used NMR spectroscopy to investigate potential structural changes that the SH2SH2SH3 insertion might exert on the split PH domain. As shown in Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 3, the HSQC spectrum of the joined PHN-PHC domain overlaps well with a subset of peaks from the HSQC spectrum of the PHN-SH2SH2SH3-PHC supramodule, indicating that the insertion of the SH2SH2SH3 tandem domains in the β3/β4-loop does not alter the structure of the split PH domain. We further tested whether ligand binding to the SH2SH2SH3 insertion might result in structural changes of the split PH domain. We chose a peptide ligand that is specific to the C-terminal SH2 domain to test potential ligand binding-induced structural changes to the split PH domain, as the two SH2 domains have been shown to play critical roles in enzyme activity regulation (11Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 12Carpenter G. Ji Q. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Binding of a phospho-Tyr-containing peptide encompassing the Tyr(P)-1021 site of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (36Pascal S.M. Singer A.U. Gish G. Yamazaki T. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Kay L.E. Forman-Kay J.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) to the PHN-SH2SH2SH3-PHC supramodule induced minimal chemical shift changes in the entire split PH domain (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that the binding of the C-terminal SH2 ligand to PLC-γ1 does not change the conformation and therefore the assembly of the split PH domain. As expected, binding of the C-terminal SH2 ligand peptide to the PHN-SH2SH2SH3-PHC supramodule induced significant chemical shift changes in a number of residues other than those from the split PH domain, and these residues presumably belong to the ligand-binding SH2 domain (Fig. 4C). Residue-specific chemical shift assignments of the PHN-SH2SH2SH3-PHC supramodule are required for correlating the peptide-induced shift changes to the individual residues within the SH2SH2SH3 domains. Characterization of the Interaction between the Split PH Domain of PLC-γ1 and TRPC3—Having characterized the structure of the split PH domain of PLC-γ1 in detail, we went on to study the earlier reported interaction between PLC-γ1 and TRPC3 (17Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

We were able to obtain large quantities of recombinant proteins encompassing the N-terminal 52 residues of TRPC3 (Fig. 5A), as well as a fragment containing the N-terminal 48 residues (data not shown). The authenticity of the TRPC3 fragments was verified using mass"
https://openalex.org/W2091533647,"Mice carrying the piebald mutation exhibit white coat spotting due to the regional absence of neural crest-derived melanocytes. We reported previously that the piebald locus encodes the Ednrb gene and that piebald mice express low levels of structurally intact Ednrb mRNA and EDNRB protein (Hosoda, K., Hammer, R. E., Richardson, J. A., Baynash, A. G., Cheung, J. C., Giaid, A., and Yanagisawa, M. (1994) Cell 79, 1267–1276). Here, we report that both the life span of the Ednrb mRNA and the promoter activity of the Ednrb gene are indistinguishable between wild-type and piebald mice. Introns 2–6 of the Ednrb gene in piebald mice were correctly excised with an efficiency indistinguishable from those in wild-type mice in exon trapping experiments. We found that the piebald allele of the Ednrb gene has a 5.5-kb retroposon-like element in intron 1 possessing canonical sequences of a polyadenylation signal and a splice acceptor site. Abnormal hybrid transcripts carrying exon 1 of the Ednrb gene and a portion of the 5.5-kb element are expressed in piebald mice. The insertion of the 5.5-kb element into a heterologous intron in a mammalian expression vector markedly reduced the expression of the reporter gene. Premature termination and aberrant splicing of the Ednrb transcript caused by the retroposon-like element in intron 1 lead to a reduced level of the normal Ednrb transcript, which is responsible for the partial loss-of-function phenotype of piebald mice.

Melanocytes are specialized melanin-producing cells responsible for coat pigmentation (1Imokawa G. Mishima Y. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1994-2002PubMed Google Scholar). They arise from neural crest cells that leave the apical ridge of the neural tube and migrate dorsally to the somites and through the mesenchymal layer beneath the ectoderm until they eventually enter the epidermis (2Le Douarin N.M. Kalcheim C. The Neural Crest. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1999Crossref Google Scholar, 3Erickson C.A. Duong T.D. Tosney K.W. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 251-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A number of naturally occurring as well as targeted mutations that produce developmental defects in neural crest cell migration, differentiation, or survival have been reported in mice (4Barsh G.S.

These include piebald (s/s) mice, which are one of the spotting mutants that lack neural crest-derived melanocytes in the coat (5Jackson I.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition to the coat pigment defect, piebald lethal (sl/sl) mice, which carry a severe mutation at the s locus, manifest megacolon (9Lane P.W. J. Hered. 1966; 57: 29-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Lyon M.F. Searle A.G. Genetic Variants and Strains of the Laboratory Mouse. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdon1989Google Scholar). This defect is caused by the absence of enteric ganglia, which are also derived from the neural crest, in the distal portion of the colon (11Webster W. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1973; 30: 573-585PubMed Google Scholar). A large number of studies have established that the signaling mediated by endothelins plays an essential role in the development of neural crest-derived cell lineages (12Pla P. Larue L. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2003; 47: 315-325PubMed Google Scholar, 13Maschhoff K.L. Baldwin H.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 97: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Kurihara H. Kurihara Y. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 1999; 45: 639-651PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelin was originally identified as a potent vasoconstrictive peptide synthesized by vascular endothelial cells (15Yanagisawa M. Kurihara H. Kimura S. Tomobe Y. Kobayashi M. Mitsui Y. Yazaki Y. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1988; 332: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10243) Google Scholar). Three closely related endothelin peptides (EDN1, EDN2, and EDN3) composed of 21 amino acids have been reported (16Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yanagisawa M. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1320-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 18Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Kimura S. Kasuya Y. Miyauchi T. Goto K. Masaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2863-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). The two endothelin receptors EDNRA (endothelin receptor type A) and EDNRB (endothelin receptor type B) belong to the G protein-coupled heptahelical superfamily (19Arai H. Hori S. Aramori I. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1990; 348: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar, 20Sakamoto A. Yanagisawa M. Sawamura T. Enoki T. Ohtani T. Sakurai T. Nakao K. Toyo-oka T. Masaki T. J. Biol.

Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). EDNRA preferentially interacts with EDN1 and EDN2, but not with EDN3. EDNRB accepts all three isopeptides equally. EDN3/EDNRB interaction is essential for the development of two neural crest-derived cell lineages, epidermal melanocytes and enteric neurons (22Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G.

We demonstrated previously that the Ednrb gene is allelic to the s locus (22Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Cheung J.C. Giaid A. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). A DNA segment encompassing all of the coding exons of the Ednrb gene is deleted in the sl genome (22Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Cheung J.C. Giaid A. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the s allele expresses reduced levels of structurally normal Ednrb mRNA and EDNRB protein (22Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Cheung J.C. Giaid A. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The primary genomic lesion in the s mutation has not been described previously. Here, we report that the Ednrbs allele harbors a 5.5-kb retroposon-like element in intron 1. This leads to aberrant transcription of the Ednrb gene, resulting in a reduced level of the normal Ednrb transcript, which is responsible for the white coat spotting in s/s mice. Mice—Wild-type mice (C57BL/6J) and piebald mice (s/s SSL/Le) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Cell Culture—C6 rat glioma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-107). ROS17/2 rat osteosarcoma cells were kindly donated by Dr. Y. Takuwa (University of Tokyo). C6, ROS17/2, and COS-7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Isolation and Characterization of the Ednrb Genomic Clones—Genomic DNA prepared from the livers of s/s mice was partially digested with Sau3AI, and the first two nucleotides of the ends were filled in with dATP and dGTP. The DNA was ligated to XhoI-digested λFIXII arms (Stratagene), the ends of which were filled in with dCTP and dTTP. Recombinant DNA was packaged in vitro, and λ phages were plated on Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRA(P2) (Stratagene). A λFIXII mouse 129/Sv genomic library was purchased from Stratagene. Approximately 2 × 106 phage clones were screened with either the full-length sequence (positions 1–1958) of mouse Ednrb cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U32329) or a 2.5-kb PstI fragment sequence of mouse Ednrb intron 1 (see Fig. 3A). The DNA probe was 32P-labeled using a random primer labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Plaque hybridization and preparation of recombinant phage DNAs were carried out by standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive clones were purified and characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blot analysis. DNA sequencing of specific restriction fragments subcloned into the pBlue-script II vector (Stratagene) was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). In addition to M13 universal and reversal primers (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), sequence-specific oligonucleotides were used for sequencing. PCR was performed to determine the sizes of introns. The reaction was cycled 30 times in a cycle profile of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. Amplified DNA fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Construction of Plasmids—To construct a reporter plasmid for the measurement of the promoter activity of the Ednrb gene, a 5-kb BamHI-BssHII fragment starting in the 5′-flanking region and ending in the 5′-noncoding region of exon 1 (171 bp upstream of the initiation codon of the Ednrb gene, at the BssHII site) was linked to the firefly luciferase gene (p5kb-luc). In addition, an 11-kb SphI-BssHII promoter fragment was linked to the luciferase gene (p11kb-luc). The sequence of the luciferase gene was obtained from the reporter plasmid pTK-luc (27Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The pTK-luc plasmid was digested with BamHI and BglII to remove the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and blunt end-ligated to a 1-kb SphI-BssHII genomic fragment from ∼1.3 kb to 171 bp upstream of the initiation codon (p1kb-luc). To prepare p5kb-luc, the p1kb-luc plasmid was digested with BamHI, and the resulting larger fragment containing a 1-kb BamHI-BssHII fragment from ∼1.1 kb to 171 bp upstream of the initiation codon was ligated to a 4-kb BamHI genomic fragment from ∼5.1 to ∼1.1 kb upstream of the initiation codon. To prepare p11kb-luc, a 10-kb SphI genomic fragment from ∼11.3 to ∼1.3 kb upstream of the initiation codon was blunt end-inserted into the unique SalI site of the p1kb-luc plasmid. An Ednrb exon-trapping plasmid harboring sequences of introns 2–4 or introns 5 and 6 of the Ednrb gene was prepared as follows. A 3-kb PvuII Ednrb genomic fragment starting in intron 1 (∼0.1 kb upstream of exon 2) and extending to intron 5 (53 bp downstream of exon 5) was blunt end-inserted into the unique NotI site in the intron of the exon-trapping vector pSPL3 (introns 2–4) (Invitrogen). In addition, a 4-kb EcoRI-SacI Ednrb genomic fragment starting in intron 4 (∼0.4 kb upstream of exon 5) and extending to 401 bp in exon 7 was blunt end-ligated to the 4-kb AvaI fragment of pSPL3, in which 2077 bp of the intron 1 and 13 bp of exon 2 are eliminated (introns 5 and 6). The plasmid containing introns 5 and 6 includes the chimeric exon of the 5′-region of Ednrb exon 7 and the 3′-region of pSPL3 exon 2. To construct a reporter plasmid harboring the 5.5-kb retroposon-like element inserted heterologously into a vector intron (see Fig. 6A), the 2.5-kb XbaI-MscI fragment of the pSPL3 plasmid, which contains an intron, splice donor and acceptor sites, and some flanking exon sequences of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 tat gene, was blunt end-inserted into the unique BglII site between the promoter and reporter regions in the pTK-luc plasmid (pTK-tat-luc). The 6.5-kb EcoRV-SalI fragment carrying part of intron 1 from the Ednrb gene and the 5.5-kb retroposon-like element was then blunt end-inserted into the unique NotI site of the tat intron in pTK-tat-luc in the right orientation (pTK-tatα-luc) or the reverse orientation (pTK-tatβ-luc). Transfection—For transfection and the measurement of promoter activity, ROS17/2 or C6 cells were seeded into 6-well culture plates and cotransfected with either a control plasmid (pUC18) or a luciferase reporter plasmid (pTK-luc containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, p5kb-luc, or p11kb-luc) at 1 μg/well and with a lacZ expression plasmid at 1 μg/well using Lipofectamine and serum-free Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) following the protocols of the manufacturer. Optimal transfection conditions were 4 μl/well Lipofectamine and a 5-h incubation under serum-free conditions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were used for the luciferase assay. For transfection in exon trapping experiments, the Ednrb exon-trapping plasmid (50 ng/well) was introduced into COS-7 cells in 6-well culture plates alone or in combination with the 64-bp control exon-containing pSPL3 plasmid (50 ng/well; Invitrogen) using 4 μl/well Lipofectamine and a 12-h incubation under serum-free conditions. After 48 h, the cells were used for RNA isolation. For transfection of the reporter plasmid harboring the 5.5-kb retroposon-like element inserted heterologously into a vector intron, COS-7 cells in 6-well culture plates were cotransfected with either pUC18 or a luciferase reporter plasmid at 1 μg/well and with the lacZ expression plasmid at 1 μg/well by the DEAE-dextran method as described (21Sakurai T. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Miyazaki H. Kimura S. Goto K. Masaki T. Nature. 1990; 348: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were used for the luciferase assay. Luciferase Assay—Transfectants were harvested after 48 h, and extracts were prepared and assayed for enzyme activity as described previously (28Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B.

Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using a Dynatech microtiter plate Model ML3000 luminometer and Model MR5000 spectrophotometer, respectively. Luciferase values were normalized for transfection and harvesting efficiency by measuring β-galactosidase activity, and the results are reported as relative light units. Preparation and Culture of Mouse Cerebral Astrocytes—Astrocytes were obtained from newborn (first day of life) mouse cerebrum using procedures slightly modified from those of Lim and Bosch (30Lim R. Bosch E.P. Cell Culture. 1990; 2 (Conn, P. M., ed) Vol. , pp. , Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA: 47-56Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Hertz et al. (31Hertz L. Juurlink B.H.J. Hertz E. Fosmark H. Schousboe A. Shahar A. de Vellis J. Vernadakis A. Haber B. A Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 105-108Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. They were used for experiments after the third passage (21–30 days old). Astrocytes were then subcultured in 6-well plates for 3 days and allowed to grow into subconfluent monolayers. Forty-eight hours prior to the addition of an RNA synthesis inhibitor, astrocytes were changed to serum-free medium. The cells were treated with actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) or 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (60 μm); harvested 2, 4, 8, and 16 h after the inhibitor addition; and used for RNA isolation. Northern Blot Analysis and Reverse Transcription (RT) 3The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; 3′-RACE, 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ETn, early transposon. -PCR—RNA was extracted from frozen tissues of 8-week-old mice or from cultured cells using RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). For Northern analysis, total RNA (10 μg) was separated on 1.1% agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with random-primed 32P-labeled probes. The mouse Ednrb cDNA sequence and the 5.5-kb retroposon-like element sequence were used as probes. Some probes were obtained by PCR. For RT-PCR, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA with (dT)12–18 primers using SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The synthesized cDNA (0.5 μg) was amplified using buffer A included in the PCR optimization kit from Invitrogen and appropriate primers for 35 cycles in a cycle profile of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 15 min at 72 °C. The amplification products were subcloned into the pCRII cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using Sequenase Version 2.0. In exon trapping experiments, cDNA synthesis and primary and secondary PCR amplification were performed using an exon trapping system (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The amplification products were subcloned into the pAMP10 cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using Sequenase Version 2.0. The 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE) was carried out according to the 3′-RACE system of Invitrogen. The amplification products were subcloned into the pAMP1 cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using Sequenase Version 2.0. We have demonstrated previously that the Ednrb mRNA is structurally intact in terms of the overall length and coding region sequence in s/s mice, but that the expression of Ednrb mRNA in the lung is decreased to ∼25% of the wild-type levels (22Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Cheung J.C. Giaid A. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of hearts, livers, kidneys, brains, and intestines revealed that the expression of intact Ednrb mRNA is uniformly reduced in all s/s tissues examined except for the liver (Fig. 1). These observations are consistent with our previous finding that s/s mice show ∼27% of the EDNRB density in the kidney compared with wild-type mice as determined by radioligand binding assay (22Hosoda K. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Baynash A.G. Cheung J.C. Giaid A. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). First, we examined whether the decreased Ednrb mRNA level was caused by a shortened life span of the Ednrbs mRNA by monitoring the pattern of disappearance of the Ednrb mRNA after the addition of the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D or 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside to the culture of mouse cerebral astrocytes. Like s/s tissues, astrocytes from s/s mice exhibited a low level of the Ednrb mRNA with normal length. However, no appreciable difference between wild-type and s/s mice was observed in the pattern of the Ednrb mRNA disappearance from 0 to 16 h after the addition of actinomycin D or 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside, indicating that the life span of the Ednrbs mRNA is normal (data not shown). This excluded the possibility that a less stable mRNA accounts for the reduced steady-state expression of the Ednrbs mRNA. Second, we examined the possibility of decreased promoter activity of the Ednrbs gene by constructing reporter plasmids in which the expression of the firefly luciferase gene was driven by Ednrb promoter fragments from s/s and wild-type (129/Sv) mice. We isolated phage clones containing DNA segments that included the 5′-flanking region and exon 1 of the Ednrb gene from both wild-type and s/s mice as demonstrated by restriction mapping, oligonucleotide hybridization, and partial sequencing. SphI, BamHI, and BssHII restriction sites were conserved between the Ednrb promoter regions of wild-type and s/s mice (in the 5′-flanking region, ∼11.3 and ∼1.3 kb upstream of the initiation codon for SphI; in the 5′-flanking region, ∼5.1 and ∼1.1 kb upstream of the initiation codon for BamHI; and in the 5′-noncoding region of exon 1, 171 bp upstream of the initiation codon for BssHII in the Ednrb gene of both mice). A 5-kb BamHI-BssHII fragment from ∼5.1 kb to 171 bp upstream of the initiation codon or an 11-kb SphI-BssHII fragment from ∼11.3 kb to 171 bp upstream of the initiation codon in both mice was used as the promoter in luciferase reporter plasmids (designated as p5kb-luc and p11kb-luc, respectively), and the reporter plasmids were introduced into C6 glioma and ROS17/2 osteosarcoma cells, which express endogenous EDNRB, for the luciferase assay. The luciferase expression directed by the 5-kb Ednrb fragment in both ROS17/2 and C6 cells was indistinguishable between wild-type and s/s mice (data not shown). The 11-kb Ednrb fragment-directed luciferase expression in both cells was also indistinguishable between the two genotypes (data not shown). Mock-transfected cells expressed luciferase levels that were not significantly different from the background of the luminometer. These results indicate that promoter activity in the 11-kb 5′-region of the Ednrbs gene is normal. Moreover, the nucleotide sequences of a 453-bp region upstream of the initiation codon of the Ednrb gene (containing the 221-bp 5′-noncoding region of the mouse Ednrb mRNA reference sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_007904)) are identical in wild-type and s/s mice, suggesting that exon 1 and the proximal promoter of Ednrbs are structurally intact (data not shown). This excluded the possibility that an abnormal cis-element in the 11-kb 5′-region of the Ednrbs allele contributes to the reduced mRNA expression. Third, we examined the intron structure of the Ednrbs gene. Eleven and 12 positive clones that covered all introns of the Ednrb gene as demonstrated by restriction mapping, Southern hybridization, and partial sequencing were isolated from genomic DNA libraries of wild-type (129/Sv) and s/s mice, respectively. Of the 11 and 12 clones each, three overlapping clones were used for a detailed characterization of the two mouse genomic sequences. The nucleotide sequences of the exon-intron junctions of the Ednrb gene from both mice were determined (data not shown). The sizes of exons 2–6 in the Ednrb gene of both mice were 113, 205, 150, 134, and 109 bp, respectively, and are in complete concordance with those of the reported mouse Ednrb genomic structure (GenBank™ accession number NT_039609). The sizes of introns 1–6 (except for Ednrbs intron 1) in both mice were ∼20.0, 0.2, 1.5, 0.6, 0.6, and 2.3 kb, respectively, and are consistent with those of the reported mouse Ednrb genomic structure (GenBank™ accession number NT_039609). Surprisingly, the size of intron 1 in s/s mice was 5.5 kb longer than that in wild-type mice (see below). All of the 5′- and 3′-splice sites in Ednrb introns 1–6 of both mice conformed to the GT-AG rule (32Breathnach R. Benoist C. O'Hare K. Gannon F. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4853-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar); and in addition, adenosine residues in presumed branch sites within introns 1–6 were conserved between the two genotypes (data not shown) (33Sharp P.A. Science. 1987; 235: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Subsequently, to investigate the precision and efficiency of excision of Ednrb introns 2–6 during RNA splicing, we performed exon trapping experiments in which the RT-PCR-amplified product from COS-7 cells transfected with a genomic insert-containing exon-trapping vector represented a chimeric transcript produced by the pairing of vector (pSPL3) and genomic (Ednrb) exons (34Church D.M. Stotler C.J. Rutter J.L. Murrell J.R. Trofatter J.A. Buckler A.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The Ednrb exon-trapping plasmid harboring the sequences of introns 2–4 or introns 5 and 6 of the Ednrb gene from wild-type and s/s mice was introduced into COS-7 cells alone or together with the 64-bp control exon-containing pSPL3 plasmid as a positive control. We detected RT-PCR-amplified products of the expected length (779 and 808 bp, respectively, when introns 2–4 and introns 5 and 6 are excised) in cells transfected with the wild-type and s/s Ednrb exon-trapping plasmids (Fig. 2). The ratio of the transcripts produced by the Ednrb exon-trapping plasmid to those produced by the cotransfected positive control plasmid (244 bp) was not significantly different between the two genotypes (Fig. 2). We detected no PCR product in mock-transfected cells. These findings indicate that introns 2–6 of the Ednrb gene in s/s mice are correctly excised with an efficiency indistinguishable from those in wild-type mice during splicing. Together with the results of the structural analysis of Ednrbs introns 2–6, the data suggest that the sequences of Ednrbs introns 2–6 do not have any detrimental effects on gene expression. Finally, we focused on an abnormality in intron 1 of the Ednrbs gene. Comparison of intron 1 in wild-type and s/s mice indicated that a 5.5-kb DNA element is inserted ∼15 kb downstream of exon 1 and ∼5 kb upstream of exon 2 in the Ednrbs gene (Fig. 3A). Nucleotide sequences of the insert and its flanking regions were determined for the wild-type and s/s DNAs (Fig. 3B). The entire length of the insert DNA is 5056 bp, and the nucleotide sequence data have been submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with accession number AB242436. The first 507 bp at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the insert DNA have the same sequences and are highly homologous to the 526-bp direct terminal repeats in insertion sequences of the nonagouti (a) and the black-and-tan (at) alleles of the agouti locus (35Bultman S.J. Klebig M.L. Michaud E.J. Sweet H.O. Davisson M.T. Woychik R.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The 507-bp direct repeat carries sequences of a canonical AATAAA polyadenylation signal (36Manley J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and of a T cluster (TTTCTTTT) 49 nucleotides downstream of the signal (36Manley J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The T cluster is conserved in the areas for transcription termination and 3′-processing and usually lies between 5 and 30 nucleotides downstream of the polyadenylation site (36Manley J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, canonical sequences of a splice acceptor site (37Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar) and of a branch site 54 nucleotides upstream of the acceptor site (33Sharp P.A. Science. 1987; 235: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) are present. A search for the core sequence of the 5.5-kb element in the data base revealed that a 460-bp 3′-region (positions 3987–4446), a 273-bp internal region (positions 3098–3370), and a 164-bp internal region (positions 2177–2340) in the core sequence of the 5.5-kb element (GenBank™ accession number AB242436) are highly homologous to positions 3187–3647 (GenBank™ accession number AF030884) of the mouse early transposon (ETn) element near the Pafaha-ps2 gene (38Péterfy M. Gyuris T. Antonio L. Takács L. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 216: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), positions 345–616 (GenBank™ accession number X57268) of the mouse ETn-related t haplotype-specific element within the H-2 complex (39Uehara H. Ebersole T. Bennett D. Artzt K. Genetics. 1990; 126: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a short stretch of a retroviral pol gene (positions 3696–3860 of GenBank™ accession number AF246633) in the mouse ETn-related MusD element (40Mager D."

Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 176: 181-193PubMed Google Scholar). The emergence of quasispecies poses serious issues for AIDS treatment and vaccine development. Indeed, during most antiretroviral therapies, drug-resistant variants and viruses escaping the immune surveillance quickly appear (2Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. Adv. Virus Res. 1996; 46: 97-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Conway B. Wainberg M.A. Hall D. Harris M. Reiss P. Cooper D. Vella S. Curry R. Robinson P. Lange J.M. Montaner J.S. AIDS. 2001; 15: 1269-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular determinants of HIV-1 variability is of critical importance for the design of new highly active antiretroviral drugs.Several mechanisms contribute to HIV-1 hypermutability. Reverse transcription, which comprises the early stage of the viral replication cycle, is the major source of retrovirus variability. Reverse transcriptase (RT) catalyzes the conversion of the single-stranded genomic RNA into a double-stranded viral DNA that is subsequently imported into the nucleus and integrated into the host cell genome by integrase. RT is error-prone and has the ability to misincorporate nucleotides during polymerization and to extend the mispaired nucleotides (4Perrino F.W. Preston B.D. Sandell L.L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This is thought to generate one or several mutations per round of virus replication. In addition to the obligatory first and second DNA strand transfers, RT mediates random strand transfers that generate recombinant viruses (6Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). These transfer events can be triggered by pauses during reverse transcription because of secondary structures in the viral RNA, mispaired nucleotides, or nicks (7Diaz L. DeStefano J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3086-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Diaz L. Cristofaro J.V. DeStefano J.J. Arch.

Previous results indicate that 30% of the transfers are coupled with point mutations at the site of transfer (10Darlix J.L. Vincent A. Gabus C. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. C. R. Acad. Sci. III, Sci. Vie. 1993; 316: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, RT is able to add one or more non-template nucleotides on the cDNA 3′-end while copying RNA ends (11Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3890-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Golinelli M.P. Hughes S.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5894-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As the genomic RNA is not fully protected against cellular nuclease degradation, RT is thought to encounter multiple ends during reverse transcription (5Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 14Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). cDNAs bearing the extra nucleotides are likely transferred onto the second RNA molecule to allow polymerization rescue. Data show that these transfers often result in substitutions (9DeStefano J.J. Raja A. Cristofaro J.V. Virology. 2000; 276: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).During polymerization, RT interacts with and is assisted by the viral nucleocapsid protein NC (5Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 10Darlix J.L. Vincent A. Gabus C. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. C. R. Acad.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). NC is a well conserved small basic protein with two zinc finger motifs flanked by regions rich in basic residues. NC molecules coat the dimeric genome, forming the nucleocapsid structure within the virion, and are implicated in the early phases (proviral DNA synthesis) and late phases (genomic RNA dimerization and packaging) of the viral replication cycle. NC promotes reverse transcription by directing the annealing of primer tRNALys-3 to the primer binding site (15Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Nugeyre M.T. Gruninger-Leitch F. Barre-Sinoussi F. LeGrice S.F. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition, NC stimulates minus and plus strand DNA transfers by promoting hybridization of the complementary repeat (R) sequences from the cDNA and the RNA template and by annealing of the tRNA and primer binding site sequences, respectively (10Darlix J.L. Vincent A. Gabus C. de Rocquigny H. Roques B. C. R. Acad. Sci. III, Sci. Vie. 1993; 316: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar, 16Allain B. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Berlioz C. Darlix J.L.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13817-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). NC also promotes specific proviral DNA synthesis by inhibiting self-primed reverse transcription (19Guo J. Henderson L.E. Bess J. Kane B. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Gabus C. Rau M. Darlix J.L. J. Mol.

Virol. 1996; 70: 4996-5004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, NC was found to play a role in the maintenance of the newly made HIV-1 DNA by protecting the long terminal repeat sequences from nuclease attack and was also found to assist integrase (22Poljak L. Batson S.M. Ficheux D. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Kas E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Bampi C. Jacquenet S. Lener D. Decimo D. Darlix J.L. Int. J.

Virol. 2003; 77: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Because NC plays key roles in the early steps of reverse transcription and in the DNA strand transfers, we wanted to investigate its possible function in viral variability. To investigate the influence of NC on nucleotide addition or substitution by RT, we established in vitro model systems containing HIV-1 RNA and cDNA and NC and RT proteins. In addition to the wild type (wt) RT, we used AZT- and ddI-resistant RTs, because they represent the major forms of resistant RTs selected in patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy. Our results show that all RTs can add nucleotides in a non-templated fashion at the cDNA 3′-end. Purines were preferentially added, and this was independent of the ultimate residue. NC was found to stimulate this nontemplate addition of nucleotides by RTs. Nucleotide substitutions by RT were examined using the same in vitro systems, where 3′-mutated cDNAs were extended. In the presence of NC, RT extension of the mutated cDNAs was efficient, and more importantly in most cases, mutations were corrected.To further investigate how the presence of NC affects the interaction between RT and its substrate and thus its activity, we examined the influence of NC on the dissociation rate of RT on a duplex DNA. Our data indicate that NC significantly stabilizes the binary complex between HIV-1 RT and duplex DNA and therefore should be viewed as a critical RT co-factor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA and DNA—RNAs were either HIV-1 RNA-generated in vitro by T7 phage RNA polymerase (10Darlix J.L.

DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were supplied by Invitrogen or Integrated DNA Technologies. All of the other reagents were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest purity available. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides were prepared using phage T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP. DNAs were purified by 8% PAGE in 7 m urea.

Nucleoprotein complexes were subsequently used for RT-directed terminal addition, nucleotide excision, and primer extension assays.Template-independent Addition of nt, Nucleotide Excision, and Primer Extension Assays—Once nucleoprotein complexes were formed, the reaction volume was increased to 25 μl by adding HIV-1 RT at 0.25 μm, one dNTP (Invitrogen) at 0.25 mm, or an equimolar mixture or AZTTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 0.1 mm, 30 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. Incubation was for 30 min at 37 °C, after which the reaction was stopped by adding 0.5% SDS and 5 mm EDTA. Nucleic acids were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and then ethanol-precipitated. Pellets were dissolved in formamide, denatured at 95 °C for 1 min, and analyzed by 12% PAGE in 7 m urea.Determination of Dissociation Rate Constants by Single Nucleotide Incorporation—Single nucleotide extension was evaluated on a 27-nucleotide DNA template (5′-AGCTACTCGATATGGCA ATAAGACTCC-3′) annealed to a 5′-end-labeled 23-nucleotide primer (5′-GGAGTCTTATTGCCATATCGAGT-3′). The reaction mixture contained 25 nm template-primer and 37 nm HIV-1 RT in 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 40 mm NaCl, 9 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100. When included in the mixture, the concentration was 1.2 μm for NC-(1-71) and up to 2.4 μm for NC-(1-55)rec. After preincubation for 3 min at 37 °C, heparin was added to sequester dissociated RT and ensure single round nucleotide incorporation. For reactions lacking NC, the minimal heparin concentration (10 μg/ml) that inhibits rebinding of RT to the primer-template was used. For reactions containing NC, the heparin concentration was increased to 2 mg/ml to account for a potential decrease in effective heparin concentration because of binding with the basic NC. Incubation was continued for times ranging from 9 to 360 s before dATP was added to a final concentration of 25 μm to initiate single nucleotide incorporation. The sample was then placed on ice and the reaction stopped by mixing with an equal volume of 89 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA, and 95% (v/v) formamide containing 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Reaction products were resolved by high voltage-denaturing 10% PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging. The fraction of enzyme bound to the template was plotted as a function of time and the dissociation rate constant koff estimated by fitting the data with KaleidaGraph to the single exponential function y = A·exp(-koff·t), where A is amplitude, koff is dissociation rate, and t is incubation time with the trap. Note that initiating the primer extension with dATP at varying times after the addition of heparin reveals the fraction of RT still bound to the template at this time point.To assess the concentration-dependent effect of NC on single nucleotide extension, the reaction was modified as follows: a mixture containing 25 nm template-primer and 25 nm HIV-1 RT was preincubated with varying concentrations of NC (0.1-1.2 μm NC-(1-71) or 0.2-3.2 μm NC-(1-55)rec in 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 40 mm NaCl, 9 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100. After 3 min, heparin was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 50 s at 37 °C. Primer extension was initiated by the addition of dATP to a final concentration of 25 μm. In a second set of experiments, reaction mixtures contained, in addition to the varying amounts of NC-(1-71) (0.1-1.2 μm), a constant and excess amount of 1.6 μm NC-(1-55)rec. Products were resolved and analyzed as described above.DNA Sequencing—cDNAs synthesized by RT extension of wild type or mutated DNA primers with or without NC-(1-72) were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol-precipitated. cDNAs were PCR-amplified using a high fidelity Taq polymerase (Promega) and specific primers bearing restriction sites TARamp(-) (5′-GGGATCCGCTAGCCAGAGAGCTCCCGG-3′) and TARamp(+) (5′-GGAATTCGTGCTTTAAGTTAGTACC-3′). Amplified DNAs were then digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into pSP64 vector digested with the same enzymes. Ligations were performed using Invitrogen T4 DNA ligase transformed and amplified in an E. coli recA- strain. Plasmids were sequenced and sequences analyzed using the Edit View software.RESULTSInfluence of NC on Non-template Nucleotide Addition by RT—Non-template addition of nucleotides by RT is thought to occur at the blunt end of the newly made duplex template. During HIV-1 reverse transcription, such additions may take place during the two obligatory strand transfers and also at non-obligatory strand transfers caused by nicks in the genomic RNA (11Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5894-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).To study non-template nucleotide additions at the cDNA 3′-end by HIV-1 RT, we derived an in vitro system formed of an RNA template, a primer DNA corresponding to the newly synthesized cDNA, NC, HIV-1 RT, and dNTPs (Fig. 1). Four types of template-primer were used with either one of the four possible cDNA 3′-ends. Sequences used were derived from the HIV-1 genome or from non-viral sequences (Table 1). The addition of NC to RNA and 5′-end 32P-labeled primer DNA caused the concomitant formation of nucleoprotein complexes (20Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Gabus C. Rau M. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Tanchou V. Gabus C. Rogemond V. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and hybridization of the primer DNA and template RNA. In the absence of NC, annealing was carried out by heating (see “Experimental Procedures”). Next, either one or a mixture of the four dNTPs and RT were added. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 30 min and [32P]cDNAs resolved on a 12% denaturating polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1).Non-template nucleotide addition activity was assayed with wild type RT, NC-(1-72) and several different classes of template-primer complexes with each cDNA 3′-end as indicated in Fig. 2. Results show that RT, in the absence of NC, can efficiently add one nucleotide at the cDNA3′-end, preferentially A or G when the 3′-end is T, G, or C (Fig. 2, B-D) and not when it is A (Fig. 2A). These results are in good agreement with previous data from several groups (9DeStefano J.J. Raja A. Cristofaro J.V. Virology. 2000; 276: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 11Patel P.H.

In the presence of NC, RT was able to add A, G, or T at the cDNA 3′A (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the addition of 4-6 consecutive T or G bases was also observed on template-primer complexes 3 and 7 (Fig. 2, B and D). However, NC did not change the pattern of the RT-directed addition, which remained A,G>T>>C. (Fig. 2). The non-template addition of nucleotides by RT requires a hybrid, because when DNA was not hybridized to the RNA template, no addition was observed (data not shown).FIGURE 2Template-independent nucleotide addition by wild type HIV-1 RT at the cDNA 3′-end. Nucleoprotein complexes were formed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Four types of RNA-DNA hybrids were used: 3′A DNA (P/T#1-2)(A), 3′T DNA (P/T#3-4) (B), 3′G DNA (P/T#5-6) (C), and 3′C DNA (P/T#7-8) (D). Nucleic acid sequences are presented in Table 1. NC-(1-72) to nucleotide molar ratios used were 0 (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) and 1:6 (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). After nucleoprotein complex formation, blunt end RNA-DNA hybrids were incubated with 0.25μm wt HIV-1 RT and either no dNTP (lanes 1 and 2), all four dNTPs (lanes 3 and 4), or one dNTP (lanes 5-12). Arrows indicate [32P]DNA primer, and +1 shows DNA with one nucleotide added. The dark vertical line corresponds to cDNAs with several nucleotides added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the role of NC in the RT-directed non-template addition of nucleotides, we used NC-(1-55), because it is the ultimately processed form of HIV-1 NC and also the NC-(12-53) mutant corresponding to the central globular domain of the viral protein (see supplemental data). NC-(1-55) was found to be clearly less active than NC-(1-72) (Fig. 3, compare lanes 6 and 7), whereas the NC-(12-53) deletion mutant was very poorly active (Fig. 3, lane 8). These results suggest that the basic rich regions of NC are important for enhancing the non-template addition of nucleotides by HIV-1 RT.FIGURE 3Influence of NC variants on the template-independent addition of nucleotide by RT. Nucleoprotein complexes were formed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two types of RNA-DNA hybrids were used: 3′A(P/T#1) and 3′C(P/T#7) DNAs (Table 1). NCs used were NC-(1-72) (lanes 2 and 6), NC-(1-55)synt (lanes 3 and 7), and mutant NC-(12-53) without the basic regions (lanes 4 and 8). The NC to nucleotide molar ratios used were 0 (lanes 1 and 5) and 1:6 (lanes 2-4 and 6-8). After formation, blunt end RNA-DNA hybrids were incubated with WT HIV-1 RT at 0.25 μm and either no dNTP (lanes 1-4) or all four dNTPs (lanes 5-8). Arrows indicate [32P]DNA primer, +1 shows DNA with one nucleotide added, and black vertical line corresponds to cDNAs with multiple nucleotides added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Non-template Addition of Nucleotides by RT Mutants Resistant to Antiviral Drugs—Non-template addition of nucleotides by RT was analyzed with the AZT (T215Y)- and ddI (L74V)-resistant RTs, NC-(1-72), and four different classes of template-primer complexes, with each cDNA 3′-end as reported in Fig. 4. Results show that the AZT- and ddI-resistant RTs retained their non-template nucleotide addition activity (Fig. 4A), which was also enhanced by NC with cDNA 3′A (P/T #1) and 3′C (P/T #7) (Fig. 4A, lanes 3, 4, 7, 11, and 12). However, in contrast to wt RT, these mutants were unable to catalyze multiple nucleotide additions (Fig. 4A, compare P/T panel #7, lanes 4, 8, and 12). A terminal addition pattern similar to wild type RT was observed for the mutant enzymes, namely A,G>T>C (data not shown). Moreover, stimulation of the non-template addition of mutant RTs by NC was dependent on the basic regions of NC (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4AZT- and ddI-resistant RTs retain non-template nucleotide addition activity. A, reactions were performed using WT (lanes 1-4), AZTR (lanes 5-8), or ddIR (lanes 9-12) RTs, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The NC-(1-72) to nucleotide molar ratio was 0 (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) or 1:6 (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). Four types of RNA-DNA hybrids were used with 3′A (P/T#1), 3′T (P/T#4), 3′G (P/T#5), and 3′C (P/T#7) cDNAs (Table 1). After nucleoprotein complex formation, RT at 0.25 μm was added without dNTP (lanes 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10) or with an equimolar mix of the four dNTPs (lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12). B, effect of NC mutation on drug-resistant RT terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase activity. Assays were performed as in A. NCs were NC-(1-72) (lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 18) and mutant NC-(12-53) with the deleted basic regions (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18). Arrows indicate [32P]DNA primer, arrowheads annotated +1 show DNA with one nucleotide added, and the black vertical line corresponds to cDNAs with multiple nucleotides added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Evidence That RT Has a DNA Repair Activity—As already pointed out, a major source of HIV-1 variability is the fact that RT can introduce point mutations into the cDNA chain during the polymerization reaction (4Perrino F.W. Preston B.D. Sandell L.L. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Previous experiments from this laboratory showed that HIV-1 RT was able to extend 3′-mutated cDNAs, although copying a HIV-1 RNA template in the presence of NC-(1-72) (20Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Gabus C. Rau M. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, cDNA extension efficiencies were ∼40%, 23 and 5% for one, three, and five mutations at the cDNA 3′-end, respectively, compared with the non-mutated cDNA. Given the propensity of HIV-1 RT to add nucleotides in a non-template fashion and incorporate mutations in growing cDNA chains, we re-investigated the RT extension of cDNA with 1-5 mutations at the 3′-end in the presence or absence of NC. We used an RNA template representing the 3′ region of an HIV-1 genome. Mutations were at the cDNA 3′-end, whereas the 5′-end was 32P-labeled (Tar WT, Tar 3′mut1, Tar 3′mut3, and Tar 3′mut5) (Table 1). The primer cDNA and template RNA were first incubated with NC-(1-72) to form the nucleoprotein complex. Thereafter, HIV-1 RT and dNTPs were added to allow cDNA synthesis. The levels of cDNA synthesis were higher with NC than without (data not shown) and were similar to those already published (20Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Gabus C. Rau M. Darlix J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNAs were PCR-amplified, cloned, and sequenced. A high fidelity Taq polymerase was used to prevent introducing mutations during the amplification step (see “Experimental Procedures”).Sequencing results summarized in Table 2 were unexpected, because they show that the original mutations were rarely found when cDNA synthesis was performed in the presence of NC-(1-72). For example, a single mutation was corrected >80% of the time. Similarly, high correction values were obtained with 3 and 5 consecutive mutations. It was interesting to note that a single mutation was retained ∼14% of the time, whereas partially corrected sequences were found in 10% of the cDNAs sequenced (Tables 1 and 2, 3′mut3). These results indicate that RT in the presence of NC-(1-72) can correct mismatches at the cDNA polymerization site in vitro, although not completely. In the absence of NC, RT was still capable of partially correcting a single mutation at the cDNA polymerization site, but this was decreased by at least 3-fold when three consecutive mut"

https://openalex.org/W1986869728,"Infections of human papillomavirus (HPV) induce a variety of benign tumors, such as warts and condylomas. During the process of aberrant cell proliferation, genetic mutations are accumulated in the cells, from which malignant tumor cells arise. The viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 are known to help disrupt the cell cycle checkpoint machinery and accelerate chromosomal instability, events which are critical in malignant conversion. However, the mechanisms involved in the hyperplasia caused by HPV infection have remained unknown. We analysed the effects of regulatory genes of HPV18, a typical high-risk-type HPV, on the formation of the epithelial organ by using an organotypic culture system, and found that E7 had potent activity to induce hyperplasia, to which the disruption of the pRb pathway was well correlated. However, analysis with the E7 variants indicated that other pocket proteins are also involved in the activity."
https://openalex.org/W1983220403,"Transcription factors with helix–loop–helix (HLH) motif play critical roles in controlling the expression of genes involved in lineage commitment, cell fate determination, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. To examine whether the newly identified HLH protein GCIP/CCNDBP1 modulates cell fate determination and plays a role in hepatocyte growth, proliferation, and hepatocarcinogenesis, we generated transgenic mice with human GCIP gene driven by a liver-specific albumin promoter. We demonstrated that in GCIP transgenic mice, the overall liver growth and regeneration occurred normally after liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). In the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced mouse hepatocarcinogenesis, we demonstrated that overexpression of GCIP in mouse liver suppressed DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis at an early stage of tumor development. The number of hepatic adenomas at 24 weeks was significantly lower or not detected in GCIP transgenic male mice compared to the control mice under the same treatment. Although GCIP has little inhibition on the number of hepatic tumors at later stages (40 weeks), hepatocellular tumors in GCIP transgenic mice are smaller and well-differentiated compared to the poorly differentiated tumors in wild-type mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GCIP functions as a transcriptional suppressor, regulates the expression of cyclin D1, and inhibits anchorage-independent cell growth and colony formation in HepG2 cells, suggesting a significant role of GCIP in tumor initiation and development."
https://openalex.org/W2003531369,"Since the 1990s, phytoplankton biomass on the continental shelf of Nova Scotia and in the Labrador Sea has undergone sustained changes in the spring and fall, which are accompanied by changes in bacterioplankton that are dampened in amplitude but coherent in the direction of change. A reversal of trend in biomass change, so-called sign switching, occurs both in time and in space. Thus, whenever (spring or fall) and wherever (Scotian Shelf or Labrador Sea) phytoplankton increase or decrease, so also does bacterioplankton. This tandem sign switch indicates coupling of the trophic levels at a multiyear time scale and contributes to an ecological fingerprint of systemwide forcing."

Furthermore, deletion of Csk did not interfere with Rac activation and lamellipodia formation, but impaired the focal adhesions. Our data demonstrate a critical role for Csk in cell migration. Protein-tyrosine kinase Csk (C-terminal Src kinase) was originally purified as a kinase capable of phosphorylating Src and other Src family kinases at their C-terminal tyrosine residues (1Okada M. Nada S. Yamanashi Y. Yamamoto T. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24249-24252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation suppresses the kinase activity of Src-family tyrosine kinases (such as c-Src, Fyn, and Lyn). Therefore, most physiological studies regarding Csk function have been focused on Csk as a negative regulator of Src-family tyrosine kinases. Csk is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and is evolutionarily conserved from the early diverged metazoan Hydra to humans (3Miller M.A. Malik I.A. Shenk M.A. Steele R.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Csk-/- mouse embryos exhibited defects in neurulation, an inability to complete the turning process, and a failure of the allantois to connect with the chorion, preventing the formation of the umbilical cord and placenta (4Imamoto A.

However, Src-/-Csk-/- mouse embryos still died around embryonic days 10-11, implying a Src-dependent and -independent function for Csk (6Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A.

Indeed, cellular and biochemical studies suggested that Csk also interacts with other proteins, such as protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 2The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SH, Src homology. 2The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SH, Src homology.-PEST (7Davidson D. Cloutier J.F. Gregorieff A. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23455-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because of the embryonic lethal phenotype of Csk-knock-out mice, the physiological functions of Csk need to be investigated in individual cellular signaling processes and in different tissues and organs. Cell migration underlies many physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, angiogenesis, inflammation, and neuronal outgrowth (8Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar). Aberrant migration contributes to pathologies such as atherosclerosis, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Cell migration is a dynamic, cyclical process in which a cell extends a protrusion at its front, which in turn attaches to the substratum on which the cell is migrating (9Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3813) Google Scholar). This is followed by a contraction that moves the cell body forward toward the protrusion, and finally the attachments at the cell rear release as the cell continues to move forward. The cycle is initiated by external signals, which are sensed and communicated to the interior of the cell by specialized receptor proteins in the cell membrane. Focal adhesion turnover (the continuous formation and disassembly of adhesions) is critical for cell migration (10Webb D.J. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Adhesion formation takes place at the leading edge of protrusions, whereas disassembly occurs both at the cell rear and at the base of protrusions. Despite the importance of these processes in cell migration, the mechanisms that regulate adhesion formation and disassembly remain largely unknown. Previously, we and others have shown a critical role of Csk in regulating actin cytoskeletal reorganization. However, a potential role of Csk in controlling cell migration has not been investigated. Here we have shown that deficiency of Csk blocked the MEF cell migration induced by various stimuli including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) through its G protein-coupled receptors, by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) through their receptor tyrosine kinases, and by serum. Hence, Csk plays a general regulatory role in cell migration. Although Csk is generally considered to play a negative role in cellular signaling, our data demonstrate a positive role for Csk in cell migration. Furthermore, we have shown that Csk deficiency led to impaired focal adhesions, thus providing a possible mechanism by which Csk controls cell migration. Cells and Reagents—The MEF, Csk-/-, Csk-/-/Csk, Csk-/-/Csk(D314N), and Csk-/-/Csk(R318A) cells were described before (11Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A.

MEF cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, streptomycin, and penicillin. PDGF-BB was from Sigma. LPA was from Cayman Chemical Company.

Cells were plated onto gelatin-coated glass coverslips. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then washed with PBS three times. To block nonspecific binding, the cells were incubated with a solution of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize actin. After incubation with primary antibody, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were then fixed onto slides and imaged using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. In Vitro Wound-healing Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration assays were performed as described previously (12Shan D. Chen L. Njardarson J.T. Gaul C. Ma X. Danishefsky S.J. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3772-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Yang S. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27130-27137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to form a confluent monolayer in a 24-well plate coated with gelatin before wounding. The wound was made by scraping a conventional pipette tip across the monolayer. The migration was induced by adding medium supplemented with or without 10% FBS. For MEF cells, it typically took 8-10 h for the wound to close. When the wound for the positive control closed, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet staining solution. Boyden Chamber Cell Migration Assay—MEF cells (5 × 104) suspended in DMEM (or in DMEM + 0.5% FBS when PDGF, EGF, or LPA were present in the lower chamber) were added to the upper chamber of an insert (6.5 mm diameter, 8-μm pore size; Becton Dickinson), and the insert was placed in a 24-well dish containing DMEM with or without 10% FBS, 20 ng/ml PDGF, 25 ng/ml EGF, or 10 μm LPA. In the case of C3 toxin treatment, 0.5 μm was added to both the upper and lower chamber. Migration assays were carried out for 4 h, and cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were stained with crystal violet staining solution, and cells on the upper side of the insert were removed with a cotton swab. Three randomly selected fields (10× objective) were photographed, and the cells that had migrated were counted. The migration was expressed as a percentage of migrated cells in positive control MEF cells. Percentage was calculated with the following formula: P = 100 × (M - Mnc)/Mpc, where P is the percentage of migrated cells, M is the number of migrated cells, Mnc is the number of migrated cells in negative controls (DMEM only), and Mpc is the number of migrated cells in positive controls. Western Blots—Western blots were performed as previously described (14Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared as follows. Confluent cells were harvested from 10-cm plates, washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and pellets were resuspended in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, l mm EDTA, l mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.03 mg/ml leupeptin). Resuspended pellets were sonicated, centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material, and the supernatant was saved as the whole cell extract. Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay, and equal amounts of protein were loaded onto a gel. After SDS-PAGE, protein samples were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Membrane filters were incubated in 1× Tris-buffered saline, 5% milk for 1 h, and then incubated in primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 and one time with Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed again, and the signal was detected with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Proliferation Assay—Csk-/-, Csk-/-/Csk, and MEF cells were trypsinized, resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS, and counted. 5 × 104 cells were plated per well in a 6-well dish and grown in DMEM with 10% FBS. Each day of the assay, one well of each type of cell was trypsinized, and the cells were counted. Protein Purification—The recombinant fusion protein TAT-C3 was purified as previously described (11Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The C3 exoenzyme was introduced into cells by making a fusion protein of the active domain of C3 and TAT protein of HIV-1 (15Sauzeau V. Le Mellionnec E. Bertoglio J. Scalbert E. Pacaud P. Loirand G. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1102-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The pGEX-KG TAT-C3 clone was a generous gift of Dr. Michael Olson (Institute of Cancer Research, London). The recombinant fusion protein was produced in BL21 Escherichia coli. A 1-liter culture was grown to an A600 reading of 0.6 and then induced by addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were flash frozen and then lysed by sonication in Tris-buffered saline with 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The supernatant was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 4°C. After extensive washing, the beads were cleaved with thrombin over-night at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and treated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The purified protein was applied to cells at a final concentration of 0.5 μm. Rho and Rac Activity Assays—Cells were treated with 20 μm LPA (for Rho assay) or 20 ng/ml PDGF (for Rac assay) for 10 min and then washed with PBS. Cells were then lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Thirty μg of GST-PBD (for Rac assay) or GST-RBD (for Rho assay) attached to beads were added to the cell lysates. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min, and then the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. SDS sample buffer was added to the beads, and the samples were boiled at 90 °C for 10 min and run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Rac and Rho were visualized by Western blot using anti-Rac antibody (clone 23A8, Upstate) and anti-Rho antibody (clone 26C4, Santa Cruz). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. from three experiments and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test with significance defined as p < 0.05. Deficiency of Csk Blocks MEF Cell Migration—To investigate a possible role of Csk in cell migration, we have used two approaches to compare the migration of Csk-deficient cells and wild-type cells. One approach is the qualitative in vitro wound-healing assay, the other the quantitative Boyden chamber assay (12Shan D. Chen L. Njardarson J.T. Gaul C. Ma X. Danishefsky S.J. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3772-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Yang S. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27130-27137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For the wound-healing assay, wild-type and Csk-/- MEF cells were grown to confluence. A wound (small scratch) was made in the middle of the tissue culture plate with a pipette tip. After ∼12 h in the presence of serum, wild-type MEF cells migrated and covered the wound, yet Csk-/- cells did not migrate Fig. 1). Therefore, serum-induced migration of Csk-/- cells was markedly reduced compared with the migration of wild-type MEF cells. These results were confirmed with Boyden chamber assays (Fig. 2A). To determine whether this failure of serum-induced migration of Csk-/- cells was the result of an absence of Csk, we re-expressed wild-type Csk in Csk-/- cells. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2A, Csk expression restored the migration of Csk-/- cells in response to serum. Furthermore, the Csk-/-/Csk rescue cell line expressed Csk at a lower level than the wild-type MEF cells as revealed by Western blot (Fig. 2B), indicating that the Csk protein level was not unphysiologically high in Csk-/-/Csk cells.FIGURE 2Csk is required for cell migration. A, Boyden chamber assay showed that serum induced migration of MEF and Csk-/-/Csk cells but not Csk-/- cells. Addition of a Rho inhibitor, C3 toxin, did not block serum-induced cell migration. Data represent mean ± SD. of three experiments. *, p < 0.05. B, Western blot (WB) showing the expression levels of Csk in MEF, Csk-/-, Csk-/-/Csk, Csk-/-+ Csk(R318A), and Csk-/-+Csk(D314N) cells. C, cell proliferation assays. MEF, Csk-/-, and Csk-/-/Csk cells (5 × 104 cells) were grown in the presence of 10% serum and the number of cells was counted at the indicated time. Data represent mean ± S.D. of triplicate. D, Boyden chamber assay showed that LPA, PDGF, and EGF induced migration of MEF and Csk-/-/Csk cells but not Csk-/- cells. Data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Different cell proliferation rates of wild-type MEF cells and Csk-/- cells might affect their migratory rates in wound-healing assays because these assays were performed over ∼12 h (the chamber assay was performed over ∼4 h). Thus, we examined the cell proliferation of wild-type MEF cells, Csk-/- cells, and Csk-/-/Csk rescue cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, proliferation of Csk-/-/Csk cells was slower than that of MEF or Csk-/- cells, thus, the faster rate of migration exhibited by Csk-/-/Csk cells is not because of a faster proliferation rate. Also, Csk-/- cells proliferate at a faster rate than MEF or Csk-/-/Csk cells, indicating that the lack of migration exhibited by these cells cannot be attributed to a slower rate of proliferation (Fig. 2C). Because we used serum here as an inducer and serum contains various factors, it is likely that Csk plays a general role in controlling cell migration. Indeed, LPA, PDGF, and EGF all failed to induce Csk-/- cells to migrate, whereas they induced Csk-/-/Csk cell migration (Fig. 2D). LPA acts through G protein-coupled receptors, whereas PDGF and EGF work on receptor tyrosine kinases. These results demonstrate that a deficiency of Csk blocks cell migration induced by various factors and that Csk plays a general role in controlling cell migration. The Kinase Activity of Csk Is Required for Cell Migration—Tyrosine kinases have other structural domains in addition to their catalytic kinase domains (16Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 897-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of their physiological functions are mediated by other structural domains, independent of their kinase activity. To investigate whether the kinase activity of Csk is required for cell migration, we made use of two kinase-dead mutations of Csk (CskR318A and CskD314N). These mutations at the catalytic loop of Csk reduce the catalytic activity of the protein (11Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Williams D.M. Wang D. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38127-38130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Williams D.M. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5956-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As assayed with both wound-healing and chamber assays, stable lines of Csk-/- cells expressing CskR318A or CskD314N displayed impaired migration compared with Csk-/-/Csk and MEF cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The level of Csk mutant proteins in each of these cell lines is shown in Fig. 2B. Hence, these data demonstrate that the kinase activity of Csk is required for its role in cell migration. The best studied physiological substrates for Csk are Src family tyrosine kinases. Regulation of actin cytoskeletal organization by Csk has been genetically demonstrated through Src family kinase-dependent as well as -independent pathways (6Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 11Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Src family tyrosine kinases are involved in Csk-regulated cell migration. In Csk-/- cells, the specific activity of Src is high. To study whether this higher Src activity contributed to the cell migration defect in Csk-/- cells, we treated Csk-/- cells with Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 3C). The underlying assumption is that this higher Src activity might be detrimental to cell migration even though normal levels of Src activity or regulation might be required for cell migration. As shown in Fig. 3C, low concentrations of PP2 increased Csk-/- cell migration, suggesting that higher activity of Src family kinases is at least partly responsible for the Csk-/- phenotype of defective cell migration. On the other hand, higher concentrations of PP2 inhibited cell migration. Hence, these data demonstrate that Src family tyrosine kinases are involved in Csk regulation of fibroblast cell migration. Deficiency of Csk Does Not Affect Rac Activation and Lamellipodia Formation—We have previously shown that Csk acts upstream of Rho in actin stress fiber formation induced by serum, LPA, and various G proteins (11Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here we have confirmed that Csk is indeed required for LPA-induced activation of Rho (Fig. 4A). To measure Rho activity in Csk-/- cells and Csk-/-/Csk cells, a Rho activation assay (GST-RBD pull-down) was performed. Rho activity was increased in Csk-/-/Csk cells in response to LPA. However, in Csk-/- cells, there was no increase (Fig. 4A). This Csk signaling through Rho to control actin cytoskeletal reorganization could provide a mechanism by which Csk regulates cell migration. Therefore, we examined whether Rho is involved in MEF cell migration. Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme is a specific inhibitor of Rho that works by irreversible ADP-ribosylation of Asn-41 in its effector region (19Udagawa T. McIntyre B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12542-12548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We previously used this C3 toxin to block serum-induced Rho activation and actin stress fiber formation in MEF cells (11Lowry W.E. Huang J. Ma Y.C. Ali S. Wang D. Williams D.M. Okada M. Cole P.A. Huang X.Y. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 733-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Treatment with C3 toxin had no effect on the migration of Csk-/-/Csk and MEF cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that Rho activity is not required for fibroblast cell migration. This was consistent with our finding that inhibition of Rho had no effect on fibroblast cell migration and inhibition of Rho kinase (ROCK) actually increased the migration of fibroblast cells (13Yang S. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27130-27137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In fast migrating cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, Rho and Rho kinase appear to be required for cell polarization and migration. In slow migrating cells such as fibroblasts, Rho kinase appears to inhibit migration (20Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated the role of Csk in Rac activation in fibroblast cells. An important step in cell migration is the activation of Rac and subsequent formation of lamellipodia at the leading edge of the cell (21Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). First, we tested whether Csk was essential for PDGF-induced Rac activation. The reason that we used PDGF here is that PDGF is a better stimulator of Rac activation than serum and LPA in in vitro assays. As shown in Fig. 4B, Rac activity was stimulated by PDGF in Csk-/- cells as well as in Csk-/-/Csk cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, in contrast to Rho activation, Csk is not required for Rac activation. Next, we studied whether Csk was involved in lamellipodia formation. Cells at the leading edge of a wound were fixed 3 h after wounding and stained with phalloidin to visualize actin polymers. As shown in Fig. 4C, Csk-/- cells displayed no defect in lamellipodia formation. Lamellipodia in these cells were similar to those in Csk-/-/Csk cells (Fig. 4C). After examining 300-400 cells from three separate experiments, 80% ± 1.5% Csk-/- cells, 89% ± 1.9% Csk-/-/Csk cells, and 85% ± 3% of MEF cells displayed membrane ruffles/lamellipodia. These data demonstrate that Rac signaling is intact in Csk-/- cells and that Csk is not involved in lamellipodia formation. Csk Is Involved in the Regulation of Focal Adhesions—To further investigate the mechanism by which Csk controls cell migration, we next turned our attention to focal adhesions. Cell migration requires turnover of cell adhesions to the substratum (9Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3813) Google Scholar). Several proteins that are known to associate with Csk are involved in focal adhesion turnover such as FAK, Src, and paxillin (22Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, overexpressed Csk was found to localize to focal adhesions, colocalizing with FAK and talin (23Bergman M. Joukov V. Virtanen I. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 711-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we compared the focal adhesions in Csk-/- cells and Csk-/-/Csk cells. Immunostaining of vinculin allowed the visualization of focal adhesions (Fig. 5). There were marked differences in focal adhesions in Csk-/- cells and Csk-/-/Csk cells. The focal adhesions of Csk-/- cells appeared abnormally big and mainly peripherally located, implying a defect in focal adhesion turnover. Csk-/-/Csk cells, however, displayed focal adhesions that were smaller and located throughout the cell at the ends of stress fibers (Fig. 5). Therefore, Csk deficiency impairs focal adhesion turnover. This provides a potential mechanism responsible for the defective migration of Csk-/- cells. Further investigation is needed to learn how Csk regulates focal adhesion turnover. We have shown that a deficiency of Csk blocked MEF cell migration. Toward understanding the underlying mechanism, we found that Csk has no effect on PDGF-induced Rac activation and lamellipodia formation. However, Csk-/- cells displayed larger focal adhesions, consistent with impairment in focal adhesion turnover. Thus, Csk might critically control the cycling steps of cell migration, namely the detachment of adhesions and cell body contraction. How does Csk control the repetitive turnover of focal adhesions during cell migration? We propose that Csk functions as a thermometer switch (Fig. 6). In our proposed model, extracellular signals such as integrin activate Src (probably through FAK). Src then phosphorylates p130Cas. Phosphorylated p130Cas forms a complex with Crk, in turn leading to p130Cas-Crk-DOCK180 complex formation. In this complex, DOCK180 catalyzes the activation of Rac, leading to the formation of focal complexes. As the number of focal adhesions increases, more paxillin is accumulated at the focal complexes. Therefore, more Csk will be recruited to focal adhesions by paxillin. Csk will in turn inhibit Src activity and at the same time activate the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST, starting the focal adhesion disassembly process. When the numbers of focal adhesions decrease, less paxillin and, hence less Csk, will be present at the focal complex. This will allow new focal complexes to form. This cycling of Csk association with and dissociation from the focal complex regulates the repetitive turnover of focal adhesions during cell migration. In essence, this model is based on extensive published data. We have incorporated a major regulatory role for Csk in this focal adhesion turnover. A role for the Src family tyrosine kinases in focal adhesion turnover is supported by published data (24Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 25Playford M.P. Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7928-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In Csk-/- MEF cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of several focal adhesion proteins such as cortactin, tensin, FAK, and paxillin was increased (6Thomas S.M. Soriano P. Imamoto A. Nature. 1995; 376: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 26Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578PubMed Google Scholar). Although cortactin and tensin hyperphosphorylation is Src-dependent, FAK and paxillin hyperphosphorylation is dependent on both Src and Fyn. In addition, Src tyrosine kinase has been shown to phosphorylate p130Cas to regulate p130Cas interaction with Crk (27Goldberg G.S. Alexander D.B. Pellicena P. Zhang Z.Y. Tsuda H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46533-46540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Src-/- cells had reduced adhesion-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and Csk-/- cells showed enhanced phosphorylation of p130Cas (28Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Src triggers translocation of Crk to focal adhesions via p130Cas. In wild-type MEF cells overexpressing active SrcY529F, Crk localized to podosome focal adhesions. However, in p130Cas-/- cells expressing SrcY529F, the amount of Crk at focal adhesions was reduced (29Li L. Guris D.L. Okura M. Imamoto A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of Csk targeted to focal adhesions by fusing Csk-GFP to the FAT domain (FA-Csk) (focal adhesion targeting domain of FAK) or a LIM domain (from paxillin) caused a loss of integrin-stimulated cell-matrix adhesion in fibroblasts. However, this effect was blocked by expressing activated SrcY529F in Src-/- cells expressing FA-Csk. In addition, loss of focal adhesions induced by FA-targeted Csk expression could be restored by expression of p130Cas or Crk (30Li L. Okura M. Imamoto A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1203-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, Src family tyrosine kinases are necessary for focal adhesion turnover. PTP-PEST tyrosine phosphatase has also been implicated in focal adhesion turnover. PTP-PEST directly binds to the SH3 domain of Csk, although it is not clear what the effect of Csk on the activity of PTP-PEST is (7Davidson D. Cloutier J.F. Gregorieff A. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23455-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Cloutier J.F. Veillette A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Downstream of PTP-PEST, p130Cas is a specific substrate for PTP-PEST in vitro and in intact cells (32Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In PTP-PEST-/- cells, p130Cas, paxillin, and FAK are hyperphosphorylated. Src and Crk SH2 domains showed increased affinity for p130Cas (32Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 33Cote J.F. Charest A. Wagner J. Tremblay M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13128-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PTP-PEST-/- fibroblasts displayed larger and more numerous focal adhesions in comparison to MEF cells when plated on fibronectin. PTP-PEST-/- fibroblasts showed a migration defect (34Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F. Charest A. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Lasky L.A. Tremblay M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Rat1 fibroblast cells stably overexpressing PTP-PEST have lower levels of p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation but normal levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of most proteins. The rate of cell migration of these cells is significantly reduced and p130Cas is not redistributed to the leading edge of the cell. A reduced association of p130Cas with Crk was also found in these cells (35Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3811-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, p130Cas and Crk complex with DOCK180 to activate Rac, leading to the focal complex formation. It is not clear at this point whether another protein, ELMO, is also in this p130Cas-Crk-DOCK180 complex (36Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kurata T. Sugimura H. Matsuda M. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Also, paxillin is enriched in focal adhesions (38Turner C.E. Pietras K.M. Taylor D.S. Molloy C.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 333-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Paxillin directly binds Csk and PTP-PEST (39Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hopefully, our study on the mechanism by which Csk regulates cell migration will shed light on the mechanism of cell migration and cancer metastasis and provide possible targets for chemotherapeutic drugs and markers to help clinicians assess tumor aggressiveness.

The transcription factors involved include NF-κB, STAT, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). Whether the NFAT group of transcription factors (which was first characterized as playing an important role in cytokine gene expression in the adaptive response in immune cells) participates in the acute-phase response in hepatocytes is not known. Here, we have investigated whether NFAT is part of the transcription factor cascade in hepatocytes during inflammatory stress. We report that interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-α increases expression of and activates NFATc2. C/EBP-mediated NFATc2 induction is temporally required for expression of type IIA secretory phospholipase A2. NFATc2 is also required for expression of phospholipase D1 and the calcium-binding protein S100A3. Thus, a C/EBP-NFATc2 transcription factor cascade provides an additional means to modulate the acute-phase response upon stimulation with inflammatory cytokines.

We report that interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-α increases expression of and activates NFATc2. C/EBP-mediated NFATc2 induction is temporally required for expression of type IIA secretory phospholipase A2. NFATc2 is also required for expression of phospholipase D1 and the calcium-binding protein S100A3. Thus, a C/EBP-NFATc2 transcription factor cascade provides an additional means to modulate the acute-phase response upon stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. The inflammatory response is a part of a protective means to restore cellular homeostasis and to maintain normal physiological processes after invasion by foreign entities (reviewed in Refs. 1Burger D.

In reaction to tissue injury and infection, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) 2The abbreviations used are: IL-1, interleukin-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; sPLA2-IIA, type IIA secretory phospholipase A2; PLD1, phospholipase D1; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; dn, dominant-negative; PPARγ2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2; CsA, cyclosporin A; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: IL-1, interleukin-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; sPLA2-IIA, type IIA secretory phospholipase A2; PLD1, phospholipase D1; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; dn, dominant-negative; PPARγ2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2; CsA, cyclosporin A; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid. and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are released to mediate an acute and systemic defense to restore cellular homeostasis. Both immune and nonimmune cells are actively involved in these processes. For example, differentiation of CD4+ T cells into a specific T-helper cell lineage and increased production of plasma proteins in hepatocytes are part of these protective changes. Upon stimulation with inflammatory cytokines, the expression of plasma proteins, proteases, and procoagulants in hepatocytes is increased in part by pre-existing and newly synthesized transcription factors (4Takiguchi M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Proteins involved in this transcription factor cascade include NF-κB, STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family members. Cooperative action mediated by NF-κB and C/EBP is also important for the induction of early phase inflammatory-responsive genes (6Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K.

In addition to the transcription factors that induce plasma proteins and proteases involved in the complement and coagulation cascades, early phase responsive genes also include transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ (9Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ suggests an autoregulation in gene expression among the members of the C/EBP family. The newly synthesized C/EBP proteins may then sustain and/or induce additional anti-inflammatory target genes to uphold transcription activation initiated by the inflammatory cytokines. Whether the expression of other transcription factors, in addition to C/EBP proteins, is induced and participates in the later stage of the inflammatory response to provide necessary metabolic changes to re-establish cellular homeostasis remains elusive. Understanding the basic mechanism of activation of the transcription factor cascade mediated by inflammatory cytokines will shed new light on the treatment of chronic inflammation such as sepsis and atherosclerosis. The NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cell) group of proteins was first characterized to play an important role in cytokine gene expression in immune cells (reviewed in Refs. 10Horsley V.

Recently, NFAT activity has been demonstrated in cardiac hypertrophy, adipocyte differentiation, and learning and memory (13Yang T.T.C. Xiong Q. Enslen H. Davis R.J. Chow C.-W. Mol. Cell.

A. 1998; 95: 15537-15541Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Despite the critical function of NFAT in the adaptive immune response in T and B cells (reviewed in Refs. 19Rao A. Avni O. Br. Med. Bull. 2000; 56: 969-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and 20Diehl S. Rincón M. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), the role of NFAT in the acute-phase response in hepatocytes is not known. Four distinct genes encoding closely related, calcium/calcineurin-regulated NFAT proteins (NFATc1/NFATc/NFAT2, NFATc2/NFATp/NFAT1, NFATc3/NFAT4/NFATx, and NFATc4/NFAT3) have been identified (reviewed in Refs. 21Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar and 22Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Alternative mRNA splicing of these four genes further generates multiple NFAT polypeptides. The function of these alternatively spliced NFAT isoforms remains elusive. However, all NFAT family members contain a highly conserved N-terminal NFAT homology domain for calcium/calcineurin regulation and a C-terminal Rel homology region for DNA binding. The presence of conserved regulatory domains suggests functional redundancy among different NFAT family members, although specific regulation mediated by individual NFAT family members on selective targets remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of NFAT in hepatocytes during inflammatory stress. Because inflammatory cytokines mediate acute and systemic responses by regulating transcription factor expression/activation, we ask whether NFAT is part of the transcription factor cascade during inflammatory stress. Here, we report the induction and activation of NFATc2, but not other NFAT family members, by the inflammatory cytokine IL-1 or TNF-α. Mechanistically, IL-1 induces C/EBP binding to NFATc2 transcription loci and mediates gene expression. C/EBP-mediated NFATc2 induction is temporally required for the expression of type IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA). NFATc2 is also required for the expression of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) and the calcium-binding protein S100A3. The C/EBP-NFATc2 transcription factor cascade provides an additional means to modulate the acute-phase response in the liver. Reagents—The human NFATc2 (–1 to –2000 bp) and sPLA2-IIA (–1 to –1200 bp) gene promoters were amplified from human genomic DNA and subcloned into the pGL3-luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) using the KpnI and XhoI sites and the MluI and XhoI sites, respectively. Deletions and mutations in the NFATc2 and sPLA2-IIA promoters were generated by PCR. The expression vectors for C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPγ, and NFATc2 have been described (13Yang T.T.C. Xiong Q. Enslen H. Davis R.J. Chow C.-W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3892-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The human NFATc2-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was obtained from Open Biosystems (GenBank™ accession numbers NM_012340). Anti-sPLA2-IIA polyclonal antibody and a human sPLA2-IIA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. Anti-NFATc2 antibody was generously provided by Dr. Nancy Rice (antibody 1777) (24Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Control rabbit and mouse IgG and anti-NFAT, anti-C/EBP, and anti-YY1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and/or Affinity BioReagents. Anti-β-actin Monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-acetylated histone H3 polyclonal antibody was obtained from Upstate. Cell Culture—HepG2 hepatoma cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium. HEK293 and Huh7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Primary hepatocytes from C57BL/6 mouse liver were prepared by collagenase digestion and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 1 μm dexamethasone and 10 μg/ml insulin as described (25Neufeld D.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 75: 145-151PubMed Google Scholar). All media were also supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were stimulated with IL-1 (4 ng/ml) or TNF-α (5 ng/ml) for the indicated times before harvest. To generate NFATc2 knockdown HepG2 cells, NFATc2 shRNA was transfected and selected under puromycin (0.1 mg/ml) for stably transfected clones. A similar protocol was followed to generate HepG2 cells expressing a dominant-negative (dn) NFAT inhibitor, except that cells were selected for neomycin resistance (1 mg/ml). Huh7 cells stably integrated with NFAT-luciferase reporter plasmids encoding triple repeats of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ2 (PPARγ2) proximal or distal NFAT-binding elements were similarly selected for neomycin resistance. Results were obtained with both pooled and single-cell clones. Representatives of isolated single-cell clones are presented. Microarray Analysis—Microarray analysis was designed to profile gene expression upon administration of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1. The role of calcineurin/NFAT in IL-1-regulated genes was also investigated by pretreatment with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA). Glass oligonucleotide arrays manufactured in our genomic facility were used. These glass oligonucleotide arrays contain 34,580 70-mer probe sets with controls (Qiagen Human Genome Oligo Set Version 3.0). Total RNA isolated from IL-1-treated (12 h) or untreated HepG2 cells in the presence and absence of CsA was labeled with Cy5- or Cy3-labeled dUTP and hybridized to glass oligonucleotide arrays. Gene annotation and function were determined using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery at NIAID, National Institutes of Health (available at david.niaid.nih.gov/david/) with assistance from our microarray facility. Candidate genes were selected with a difference of >1.5-fold and are reported (see supplemental material). Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—Nuclear factors that were associated with chromatin in IL-1-stimulated or unstimulated HepG2 cells were cross-linked to DNA using 1% formaldehyde. Cells were harvested, and cross-linked chromatin was sheared by sonication. Sonicated cell lysate was immunoprecipitated using antibodies as indicated. IgG was used as a control. DNA present in the immunoprecipitated chromatin was isolated using protein G-agarose, after reversed cross-link and proteinase K digestion, and PCR was performed to examine the presence of the NFATc2 gene promoter (5′-GAATTGGCTGGCACTGTCCT-3′ and 5′-ATAGACTTGTTGAATAAATC-3′), the sPLA2-IIA promoter (5′-AGGATAGCCTCTGGCTTTTTCCAGGTTTAG-3′ and 5′-GAGGATTGGGAAACCTTACGTGTCAGTAGC-3′), or the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter (5′-AGCTCAGGCCTCAAGACCTT-3′ and 5′-AAGAAGATGCGGCTGACTGT-3′). DNA Affinity Binding Assays—Streptavidin-agarose-precleared HepG2 cell extracts were incubated overnight with double-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotides (10 pmol) at 4 °C in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Protein·DNA complexes were precipitated with 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. After three washes with Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. C/EBP or NFAT in the DNA precipitates was detected by immunoblot analysis. Competition was performed using a 5-fold excess of the non-biotinylated oligonucleotide encoding the consensus C/EBP-binding (5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′) or NF-κB-binding (5′-CAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGGC-3′) sequence. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells as described previously (13Yang T.T.C. Xiong Q. Enslen H. Davis R.J. Chow C.-W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3892-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Yang T.T.C. Chow C.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15874-15885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides for gel mobility shift assays were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. The sequence for the C/EBP-binding site of the NFATc2 promoter is 5′-CCTTATGCAGTGTTTGCCAAATGTACCTGT-3′. The sequence for the NFAT-binding site of the IL-2 antigen receptor-responsive element is 5′-AGAAAGGAGGAAAAACTGTTTCATACAGAAGG-3′. The sequences for the NFAT-binding sites of sPLA2-IIA are 5′-GAGGATTGGGAAACCTTACGTGTCAGTAGC-3′ (proximal), 5′-CAGGCAGTTTTGCAGTCTTTCCATGGAGTA-3′ (middle), and 5′-AGGATAGCCTCTGGCTTTTTCCAGGTTTAG-3′ (distal). Binding reactions for gel mobility shift assays were carried out at room temperature in gel shift buffer (1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) for 30 min. Protein·DNA complexes were separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA and visualized by autoradiography. For supershift analysis, antibody was preincubated with a nuclear extract for 30 min at before addition of the labeled probe. For competition analysis, an excess amount of the unlabeled oligonucleotide (50 fmol) was incubated together with the labeled probe before addition of the nuclear extract. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The isolated RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed with mouse mammary tumor virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), and the cDNA prepared was amplified by PCR, separated, and visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The intensity of PCR products was quantified using ImageQuant Version 5.0 software (Adobe Systems, Inc.). The primers used for PCR amplification were as follows (all primers target human cDNA sequence unless indicated otherwise): NFATc2, 5′-AGAAACTCGGCTCCAGAATCC-3′ and 5′-TGGTTGCCCTCATGTTGTTTTT-3′ and mouse 5′-TGGCCCGCGACATCTACCCT-3′ and 5′-TGGTAGAAGGCGTGCGGCTT-3′; NFATc3, 5′-GCAGATCTTGAGCCAGATGAT-3′ and 5′-CCGGTAGGATGGCTCAAGAG-3′; sPLA2-IIA, 5′-ATGAAGACCCTCCTACTGTTGGCA-3′ and 5′-TCAGCAACGAGGGGTGCTCCCTCT-3′; PLD1, 5′-TGCTCTACAGGCAATCATGC-3′ and 5′-GCACTGTAGCCGAAGTCCTC-3′; and S100A3, 5′-ACACCCGAACTGGTCAACTC-3′ and 5′-GAGCGCACATACTCCACAAA-3′. The expression of GAPDH was used as a control (5′-ACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAA-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ and mouse 5′-CTGACGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAA-3′ and 5′-TTGGGGGCCGAGTTGGGATAG-3′). Luciferase Assays—The NFATc2 or sPLA2-IIA promoter plasmid (0.3 μg) was cotransfected with the pRSV-β-galactosidase control plasmid (0.1 μg) or the C/EBP or NFATc2 expression plasmid (0.3 μg) as indicated. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured 48 h after transfection. The data are presented as relative luciferase activity calculated as the ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity (means ± S.E., n = 4). Inflammatory Cytokine IL-1 or TNF-α Induces NFATc2 Expression—To investigate the role of NFAT during inflammatory stress in hepatocytes, we tested whether inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α regulate NFAT expression. Stimulation of HepG2 hepatoma cells with IL-1 or TNF-α increased NFATc2 expression (Fig. 1A). Accumulation of NFATc2 protein was evident after 8 h of IL-1 or TNF-α stimulation, although NFATc2 induction was detected as early as 4 h. However, the expression of other NFAT family members (NFATc1, NFATc3, and NFATc4) was similar in treated and untreated cells. It is interesting that NFATc2 exhibited a modest increase in electrophoretic mobility, whereas the electrophoretic mobility of other NFAT family members was similar. As reported previously, the expression of C/EBPδ was elevated upon IL-1 or TNF-α stimulation. The expression level of β-actin was used as a control. In addition to HepG2 cells, a similar induction of NFATc2 (but not other NFAT family members) upon IL-1 stimulation was observed in Huh7 hepatoma cells, HEK293 embryonic kidney cells, Caco-2 colorectal carcinoma cells, and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (data not shown). These data demonstrate that inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α increase NFATc2 expression. Next, we tested whether the induction of NFATc2 by IL-1 requires de novo mRNA transcription and protein synthesis. Administration of either the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide blocked the induction of NFATc2 by IL-1 (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate that IL-1 modulates NFATc2 at least at the mRNA level. To determine the amount of NFATc2 induction, we performed semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis using various PCR amplification cycles (Fig. 1C). IL-1 stimulation increased NFATc2 expression by ∼5-fold in HepG2 cells. However, the expression of NFATc3 and GAPDH was similar in the presence and absence of IL-1 stimulation. These data demonstrate that IL-1 selectively increases NFATc2 expression in HepG2 cells. Next, we confirmed the induction of NFATc2 by IL-1 in primary hepatocytes. Stimulation of primary hepatocytes with IL-1 increased NFATc2 mRNA expression (Fig. 1D). However, the expression of GAPDH was similar in the presence and absence of IL-1 stimulation. We also confirmed the induction of NFATc2 protein expression in primary hepatocytes by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1E). Similar to what was observed in HepG2 cells, NFATc2 protein accumulated upon IL-1 treatment in primary hepatocytes. A similar amount of β-actin was used as a control. Together, these data demonstrate that inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 increase NFATc2 expression in primary hepatocytes as well as in hepatoma cell lines. NFAT Activity Is Not Required for IL-1-induced NFATc2 Expression—An increase in NFAT electrophoretic mobility has been used as a hallmark for NFAT nuclear accumulation and activation (13Yang T.T.C. Xiong Q. Enslen H. Davis R.J. Chow C.-W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3892-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Chow C.-W. Rincón M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 27Loh C. Shaw K.T. Carew J. Viola J.P. Luo C. Perrino B.A. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10884-10891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Next, we confirmed that the modest increase in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1) promoted NFATc2 nuclear accumulation. We performed subcellular fractionation and determined the amount of NFATc2 in nuclear extracts upon IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated increased NFATc2 accumulation in the nuclear extracts upon IL-1 stimulation. However, the amount of NFATc3 and YY1 in the nuclear extracts remained similar upon IL-1 stimulation. These data demonstrate that IL-1 stimulation specifically increases and activates NFATc2. A previous study demonstrated that the expression of NFATc1 is induced upon NFAT activation (28Zhou B. Cron R.Q. Wu B. Genin A. Wang Z. Liu S. Robson P. Baldwin H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10704-10711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Autoregulation in the expression of NFAT proteins may be analogous to the induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ expression upon C/EBP activation during inflammatory stress. Thus, we examined whether the IL-1-mediated induction of NFATc2 expression requires NFAT activation using the immunosuppressant drug CsA or FK506 analog FK520, which inhibit calcineurin phosphatase and block NFAT-mediated transcription. Administration of CsA or FK520 had a minimal effect on NFATc2 induction upon IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 2B), although IL-1-mediated NFAT activation was CsA-sensitive, as there was a modest decrease in NFATc2 electrophoretic mobility. In addition, luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that IL-1-induced NFAT transcription activity was blocked by CsA (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that IL-1 increases the expression of and activates NFATc2. Unlike the induction of NFATc1, that of NFATc2 is not NFAT-dependent. C/EBP Binds to and Regulates the NFATc2 Promoter—Sequence analysis indicated that the NFATc2 promoter encodes sequences resembling the consensus DNA-binding element for C/EBP (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether C/EBP is recruited to the NFATc2 loci upon IL-1 stimulation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using anti-C/EBP antibodies (Fig. 3A). In resting untreated HepG2 cells, there was minimal C/EBP association with the NFATc2 loci. Stimulation with IL-1 increased the association of C/EBPα or C/EBPβ with the NFATc2 promoter. However, neither C/EBPα nor C/EBPβ was associated with the GAPDH promoter. These data demonstrate that C/EBP associates with the NFATc2 promoter upon IL-1 stimulation in vivo. To investigate binding of C/EBP to the NFATc2 promoter in vitro, we performed DNA affinity binding assays (Fig. 3B). Using biotinylated oligonucleotides encoding the putative C/EBP-binding site of the NFATc2 promoter, we found both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ in the DNA precipitates. Specific binding of C/EBP was demonstrated by successful competition by the consensus C/EBP sequence, but not by the NF-κB-binding elements. In addition, C/EBP was not present in the precipitates in the absence of oligonucleotides. These data demonstrate that C/EBP binds to the NFATc2 promoter. We further established binding of C/EBP to the NFATc2 promoter by gel mobility shift assays. Similar C/EBP·DNA complexes were detected using either a 32P-radiolabeled NFATc2 C/EBP-binding site or a consensus C/EBP DNA-binding element as a probe (Fig. 3C). Competition assays demonstrated that the C/EBP·DNA complex from the NFATc2 C/EBP-binding site was competed by the unlabeled NFATc2 C/EBP-binding site (i.e. self-competition) or the consensus C/EBP-binding element, but not by the mutant C/EBP-binding site. The C/EBP·DNA complex from the NFATc2 C/EBP-binding site was also supershifted by anti-C/EBP antibodies. A similar C/EBP·DNA complex was also detected using the consensus C/EBP-binding element as a probe. Together, these data demonstrate that C/EBP binds to the NFATc2 promoter. We also examined the role of C/EBP in NFATc2 promoter activity. Administration of IL-1 increased transcription activity mediated by the NFATc2 promoter (–1 to –2000 bp) (Fig. 3D). Similarly, the expression of C/EBPβ increased NFATc2 promoter activity (Fig. 3E). However, mutation or deletion (–1 to –1000 bp) of the C/EBP-binding site reduced transcription activity mediated by the NFATc2 promoter upon IL-1 stimulation or C/EBPβ coexpression. The expression of C/EBPβ caused minimal activation of the promoterless pGL3-Basic control. Together, these data demonstrate that IL-1 stimulation promotes C/EBP association with the NFATc2 promoter. Recruitment of C/EBP is likely to play a role in NFATc2 induction by IL-1 stimulation. C/EBP Activity Is Required for IL-1-mediated NFATc2 Induction—Next, we investigated the requirement for C/EBP in the induction of NFATc2. Among the C/EBP family members, at least C/EBPα and C/EBPβ bind to the NFATc2 promoter (Fig. 3). To inhibit C/EBP-mediated gene transcription, we expressed the transcription repressor C/EBPγ (also known as Ig/enhancer-binding protein) in cells. C/EBPγ lacks a transcription activation domain (29Parkin S.E. Baer M. Copeland T.D. Schwartz R.C. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23563-23572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although it contains a similar basic leucine zipper DNA-binding motif and interacts with other C/EBP family members. Thus, C/EBP-mediated transcription activation is abrogated by C/EBPγ. The expression of C/EBPγ blocked IL-1-mediated NFATc2 promoter activity (Fig. 4A). Notably, the expression of C/EBPγ reduced IL-1-mediated NFATc2 expression (Fig. 4B). A similar reduction in NFATc2 promoter activity and expression was also found upon expression of a dominant-negative C/EBP inhibitor (A-C/EBP) (data not shown). These data demonstrate that C/EBP regulates NFATc2 promoter activity and gene transcription. Activation of the C/EBP-NFATc2 transcription factor cascade and subsequent changes in the gene expression profile may be critical in mediating inflammatory stress. IL-1-induced Transcription Regulation of sPLA2-IIA—What are the targets regulated by the C/EBP-NFATc2 transcription factor cascade? We performed microarray analysis and determined the gene expression profile that was regulated by IL-1. Candidate genes with a difference of >1.5-fold were considered significant and are reported (see supplemental material). The ranges of fold induction and suppression are 1.51–19.47 and 0.70 to 0.05 in the absence of CsA and 1.52–4.38 and 0.70 to 0.04 in the presence of CsA. Microarray analysis indicated that the expression of 245 genes were induced and that of 820 genes was reduced after 12 h of IL-1 stimulation. Upon administration of CsA, 32 induced genes and 312 reduced genes elicited by IL-1 were affected. These data demonstrated that calcineurin/NFAT signaling contributes to IL-1-mediated transcription regulation. Among the IL-1-induced genes, the expression of sPLA2-IIA was reduced upon CsA treatment (see supplemental material). We elected to further investigate sPLA2-IIA transcription regulation because sPLA2-IIA contributes to arachidonic acid release upon phospholipid hydrolysis (30Gilroy D.W. Newson J. Sawmynaden P.

Hdm2 synthesis is itself tightly controlled and, as demonstrated by a recently described SNP (SNP309) in the hdm2-P2 promoter, minor variations in Hdm2 expression have phenotypic consequences on radiation sensitivity and cancer predisposition. To further define mechanisms regulating Hdm2 expression, we have investigated the effects of the GC-selective DNA-binding drug, Mithramycin A (MA) on hdm2 mRNA transcription, trafficking, and translation. Firstly we show that the constitutive hdm2-P1 promoter is inhibited by MA. We define, for the first time, the minimal sequence elements that are required for P1-promoter activity and identify those which confer MA sensitivity. Secondly, MA induces p53-dependent transcription from the hdm2-P2 promoter. Thirdly, and critically, MA also inhibits Hdm2 synthesis at the post-transcriptional level, with negative effects on hdm2 mRNA nuclear export and translation. This study highlights the complex interplay between the pathways that regulate Hdm2 protein synthesis in cancer cells, and furthermore emphasizes the export of hdm2 mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as a key point of control in this process."
