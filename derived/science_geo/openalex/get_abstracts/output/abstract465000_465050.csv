https://openalex.org/W2093283551,"Topologically nontrivial spin textures have recently been investigated for spintronic applications. Here, we report on an ultrathin magnetic film in which individual skyrmions can be written and deleted in a controlled fashion with local spin-polarized currents from a scanning tunneling microscope. An external magnetic field is used to tune the energy landscape, and the temperature is adjusted to prevent thermally activated switching between topologically distinct states. Switching rate and direction can then be controlled by the parameters used for current injection. The creation and annihilation of individual magnetic skyrmions demonstrates the potential for topological charge in future information-storage concepts."

Gao et al. (p. 903 , published 8 August) now demonstrate that the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) detects HIV infection. Reverse-transcribed HIV DNA triggers cGAS and downstream activation of antiviral immunity. Detection of HIV, as well as the retroviruses simian immunodeficiency virus and murine leukemia virus, was abrogated in mouse and human cells deficient in cGAS—suggesting that cGAS may be a critical activator of innate immunity in response to retroviral infection."

A preventative vaccine is greatly needed. Seder et al. (p. 1359 , published online 8 August; see the Perspective by Good ) now report the results from a phase I clinical trial where subjects were immunized intravenously with a whole, attenuated sporozoite vaccine. Three of 9 subjects who received four doses and zero of 6 subjects who received five doses of the vaccine went on to develop malaria after controlled malaria infection. Both antibody titers and cellular immune responses correlated positively with the dose of vaccine received, suggesting that both arms of the adaptive immune response may have participated in the observed protection."

On the one hand, group decision-making can lead to better decisions, but it can also lead to “herding effects” that have resulted in financial disasters. Muchnik et al. (p. 647 ) examined the effect of collective information via a randomized experiment, which involved collaboration with a social news aggregation Web site on which readers could vote and comment on posted comments. Data were collected and analyzed after the Web site administrators arbitrarily voted positively or negatively (or not at all) as the first comment on more than 100,000 posts. False positive entries led to inflated subsequent scores, whereas false negative initial votes had small long-term effects. Both the topic being commented upon and the relationship between the poster and commenter were important. Future efforts will be needed to sort out how to correct for such effects in polls or other collective intelligence systems in order to counter social biases."

Climate change has destabilized the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO 2 such that Graven et al. (p. 1085 , published online 8 August; see the Perspective by Fung ) have found that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle has exceeded 50% at some latitudes. The only way to explain this increase is if extratropical land ecosystems are growing and shrinking more than they did half a century ago, as a result of changes in the structure and composition of northern ecosystems."

Roukos et al. (p. 660 ) used ultrahigh-throughput time-lapse imaging on human tissue culture cells containing marked chromosomes to capture very rare translocation events. Double-strand breaks in the DNA underwent an initial “partner search,” with a fraction of the ends moving into spatial proximity to each other, which resulted in persistent pairing and the merging of DNA repair foci. Most paired ends arose from breaks in close proximity, but occasionally translocations formed from more distantly positioned breaks. Proteins of the DNA repair machinery could influence the pairing and/or translocation process."

There are thousands of other classes of VOCs, and how they are exchanged between the biosphere and the atmosphere is unclear. Park et al. (p. 643 ) measured the fluxes of more than 500 types of VOCs using a highly sensitive type of mass spectrometry and an absolute value eddy covariance method. The majority of these species were actively exchanged between the atmosphere and the biosphere, with more than a quarter showing net deposition. These results should help to improve air quality and global climate models, and strengthen our understanding of atmospheric VOC chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2061078665,"Dissecting Dystrophies Defects in α-dystroglycan lead to various congenital muscular dystrophies, and its ability to bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) is dependent on formation of a specific O-linked sugar structure. Previous efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying α-dystroglycan's ability to bind to the ECM led to the identification of a phosphorylated O -mannosyl trisaccharide on α-dystroglycan and to the demonstration that addition of this residue is a prerequisite for formation of the ligand-binding motif. However, the biosynthetic pathway that leads to production of the phosphorylated O -mannosyl glycan has not been delineated. Yoshida-Moriguchi et al. (p. 896 , published online 8 August) elucidate the functions of three genes recently found to cause dystroglycan-related disorders and explain the defects in the production of the phosphorylated O -mannosyl glycan that underlie the pathologies of patients with the relevant mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2039227951,"Strongly interacting quantum many-body systems are fundamentally compelling and ubiquitous in science. However, their complexity generally prevents exact solutions of their dynamics. Precisely engineered ultracold atomic gases are emerging as a powerful tool to unravel these challenging physical problems. Here we present a new laboratory for the study of many-body effects: strongly interacting two-level systems formed by the clock states in ${}^{87}$Sr, which are used to realize a neutral atom optical clock that performs at the highest level of optical-atomic coherence and with precision near the limit set by quantum fluctuations. Our measurements of the collective spin evolution reveal signatures of many-body dynamics, including beyond-mean-field effects. We derive a many-body Hamiltonian that describes the experimental observation of severely distorted lineshapes, atomic spin coherence decay, density-dependent frequency shifts, and correlated quantum spin noise. These investigations open the door to exploring quantum many-body effects and entanglement in quantum systems with optical energy splittings, using highly coherent and precisely controlled optical lattice clocks."
https://openalex.org/W2033318704,"RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) lies at the core of dynamic control of gene expression. Using 53 RNAPII point mutants, we generated a point mutant epistatic miniarray profile (pE-MAP) comprising ∼60,000 quantitative genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This analysis enabled functional assignment of RNAPII subdomains and uncovered connections between individual regions and other protein complexes. Using splicing microarrays and mutants that alter elongation rates in vitro, we found an inverse relationship between RNAPII speed and in vivo splicing efficiency. Furthermore, the pE-MAP classified fast and slow mutants that favor upstream and downstream start site selection, respectively. The striking coordination of polymerization rate with transcription initiation and splicing suggests that transcription rate is tuned to regulate multiple gene expression steps. The pE-MAP approach provides a powerful strategy to understand other multifunctional machines at amino acid resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2045721385,"Active dendritic synaptic integration enhances the computational power of neurons. Such nonlinear processing generates an object-localization signal in the apical dendritic tuft of layer 5B cortical pyramidal neurons during sensory-motor behavior. Here, we employ electrophysiological and optical approaches in brain slices and behaving animals to investigate how excitatory synaptic input to this distal dendritic compartment influences neuronal output. We find that active dendritic integration throughout the apical dendritic tuft is highly compartmentalized by voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels. A high density of both transient and sustained KV channels was observed in all apical dendritic compartments. These channels potently regulated the interaction between apical dendritic tuft, trunk, and axosomatic integration zones to control neuronal output in vitro as well as the engagement of dendritic nonlinear processing in vivo during sensory-motor behavior. Thus, KV channels dynamically tune the interaction between active dendritic integration compartments in layer 5B pyramidal neurons to shape behaviorally relevant neuronal computations."
https://openalex.org/W1976676155,"Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are a transient cell population of the CNS that is critical for brain development. In the neocortex, CR cells secrete reelin to instruct the radial migration of projection neurons. It has remained unexplored, however, whether CR cells provide additional molecular cues important for brain development. Here, we show that CR cells express the immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecule nectin1, whereas neocortical projection neurons express its preferred binding partner, nectin3. We demonstrate that nectin1- and nectin3-mediated interactions between CR cells and migrating neurons are critical for radial migration. Furthermore, reelin signaling to Rap1 promotes neuronal Cdh2 function via nectin3 and afadin, thus directing the broadly expressed homophilic cell adhesion molecule Cdh2 toward mediating heterotypic cell-cell interactions between neurons and CR cells. Our findings identify nectins and afadin as components of the reelin signaling pathway and demonstrate that coincidence signaling between CR cell-derived secreted and short-range guidance cues direct neuronal migration."
https://openalex.org/W2067879254,"Exosomes released from different types of host cells have different biological effects. We report that exosomes released from retinal astroglial cells (RACs) suppress retinal vessel leakage and inhibit choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a laser-induced CNV model, whereas exosomes released from retinal pigmental epithelium do not. RAC exosomes inhibit the migration of macrophages and the tubule forming of mouse retinal microvascular endothelial cells. Further, we analyzed antiangiogenic components in RAC exosomes using an angiogenesis array kit and detected several endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis exclusively present in RAC exosomes, such as endostatin. Moreover, blockade of matrix metalloproteinases in the cleavage of collagen XVIII to form endostatin using FN-439 reverses RAC exosome-mediated retinal vessel leakage. This study demonstrates that exosomes released from retinal tissue cells have different angiogenic effects, with exosomes from RACs containing antiangiogenic components that might protect the eye from angiogenesis and maintain its functional integrity. In addition, by identifying additional components and their functions of RAC exosomes, we might improve the antiangiogenic therapy for CNV in age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2080129352,"Upon reaching their intermediate target, the floorplate, commissural axons acquire responsiveness to repulsive guidance cues, allowing the axons to exit the midline and adopt a contralateral, longitudinal trajectory. The molecular mechanisms that regulate this switch from attraction to repulsion remain poorly defined. Here, we show that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan Glypican1 (GPC1) is required as a coreceptor for the Shh-dependent induction of Hedgehog-interacting protein (Hhip) in commissural neurons. In turn, Hhip is required for postcrossing axons to respond to a repulsive anteroposterior Shh gradient. Thus, Shh is a cue with dual function. In precrossing axons it acts as an attractive guidance molecule in a transcription-independent manner. At the same time, Shh binds to GPC1 to induce the expression of its own receptor, Hhip, which mediates the repulsive response of postcrossing axons to Shh. Our study characterizes a molecular mechanism by which navigating axons switch their responsiveness at intermediate targets."

Here, we present evidence that these processes can also be observed in urethane-anesthetized rats and are enhanced by desynchronized brain state evoked by tail pinch, subcortical carbachol infusion, or systemic amphetamine administration. During desynchronization, we found that repeated tactile or auditory stimulation evoked unique sequential patterns of neural firing in somatosensory and auditory cortex and that these patterns then reoccurred during subsequent spontaneous activity, similar to what we have observed in awake animals. Furthermore, the formation of these patterns was blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist, suggesting that the phenomenon depends on synaptic plasticity. These results suggest that anesthetized animals with a desynchronized brain state could serve as a convenient model for studying stimulus-induced plasticity to improve our understanding of memory formation and replay in the brain. Memory formation is hypothesized to involve the generation of event-specific neural activity patterns during learning and the subsequent spontaneous reactivation of these patterns. Here, we present evidence that these processes can also be observed in urethane-anesthetized rats and are enhanced by desynchronized brain state evoked by tail pinch, subcortical carbachol infusion, or systemic amphetamine administration. During desynchronization, we found that repeated tactile or auditory stimulation evoked unique sequential patterns of neural firing in somatosensory and auditory cortex and that these patterns then reoccurred during subsequent spontaneous activity, similar to what we have observed in awake animals.

These results suggest that anesthetized animals with a desynchronized brain state could serve as a convenient model for studying stimulus-induced plasticity to improve our understanding of memory formation and replay in the brain. Memory formation is a fundamental process needed for adaptive behavior. A growing body of evidence suggests that learning and memory processes involve the modification of ongoing spontaneous activity in an experience-dependent fashion (Wilson and McNaughton, 1994Wilson M.A. McNaughton B.L. Reactivation of hippocampal ensemble memories during sleep.Science. 1994; 265: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). As an animal’s exposure to an environment increases, the similarity between spontaneous activity and activity evoked by natural stimuli also increases (Berkes et al., 2011Berkes P. Orbán G. Lengyel M. Fiser J. Spontaneous cortical activity reveals hallmarks of an optimal internal model of the environment.Science. 2011; 331: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). This suggests that, during learning, spontaneous activity progressively adapts to the statistics of encountered stimuli (Fiser et al., 2010Fiser J. Berkes P. Orbán G. Lengyel M. Statistically optimal perception and learning: from behavior to neural representations.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2010; 14: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, an imaging study of visual cortex in rats using voltage-sensitive dyes revealed that repetitive presentation of a visual stimulus modified global patterns of subsequent spontaneous activity such that these patterns more closely resembled the evoked responses (Han et al., 2008Han F. Caporale N. Dan Y. Reverberation of recent visual experience in spontaneous cortical waves.Neuron. 2008; 60: 321-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Another compelling example suggesting adaptation of spontaneous activity was provided by a study using voltage-sensitive dyes, which showed that ongoing activity in cat visual cortex corresponded closely to functional orientation maps (Kenet et al., 2003Kenet T. Bibitchkov D. Tsodyks M. Grinvald A. Arieli A. Spontaneously emerging cortical representations of visual attributes.Nature. 2003; 425: 954-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The similarity between spontaneous and evoked patterns is not restricted only to global activity patterns but has also been found in spike-timing relations among neurons. At the microcircuit level, the precise temporal sequence of spiking evoked by external stimuli is more similar to spontaneously occurring patterns than predicted by chance. This has been demonstrated both in vitro (MacLean et al., 2005MacLean J.N. Watson B.O. Aaron G.B. Yuste R. Internal dynamics determine the cortical response to thalamic stimulation.Neuron. 2005; 48: 811-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and in vivo (Luczak et al., 2009Luczak A. Barthó P. Harris K.D. Spontaneous events outline the realm of possible sensory responses in neocortical populations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 413-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the adaptation of ongoing activity to the statistical nature of experienced stimuli can also involve sculpting the corresponding microcircuit architecture (Luczak and Maclean, 2012Luczak A. Maclean J.N. Default activity patterns at the neocortical microcircuit level.Front. Integr. Neurosci. 2012; 6: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Other data from freely moving animals suggest that such changes in sequential spiking are related to behaviorally relevant learning and memory processes. Population recordings in hippocampus or neocortex have revealed that spiking sequences observed during behavior were subsequently replayed in similar temporal order during following resting periods (Euston et al., 2007Euston D.R. Tatsuno M. McNaughton B.L. Fast-forward playback of recent memory sequences in prefrontal cortex during sleep.Science. 2007; 318: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, Ji and Wilson, 2007Ji D.

Replay of neuronal firing sequences in rat hippocampus during sleep following spatial experience.Science. 1996; 271: 1870-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Despite the likely importance of understanding the mechanisms by which stimulus-evoked sequences are “imprinted” in spontaneous activity, advances have been limited by the technological difficulty of recording neuronal population activity and manipulating neural processes in behaving animals. The hallmark of memory formation in the brain activity of freely moving animals is the emergence of stimulus-induced (or behavior-induced) sequential activity patterns that are later spontaneously replayed (Euston et al., 2007Euston D.R. Tatsuno M. McNaughton B.L. Fast-forward playback of recent memory sequences in prefrontal cortex during sleep.Science. 2007; 318: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, Ji and Wilson, 2007Ji D. Wilson M.A. Coordinated memory replay in the visual cortex and hippocampus during sleep.Nat.

Replay of neuronal firing sequences in rat hippocampus during sleep following spatial experience.Science. 1996; 271: 1870-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Although many previous studies have emphasized replay during slow-wave sleep, there is abundant evidence that it can occur during periods of wakeful quiescence, even relatively brief ones, when the hippocampus exhibits large irregular activity containing sharp wave ripple (SPWR) events and the cortex is in a relatively synchronized state, exhibiting up-down state transitions. Moreover, the actual reactivation events occur during the up states, which can be considered as brief episodes of cortical desynchronization. Finally, there is also evidence that long-term potentiation (LTP) is suppressed during slow-wave sleep in general (Leonard et al., 1987Leonard B.J. McNaughton B.L. Barnes C.A. Suppression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity during slow-wave sleep.Brain Res. 1987; 425: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) but is transiently re-enabled during SPWR events that are associated with neocortical up-state transitions (Buzsáki, 1984Buzsáki G. Long-term changes of hippocampal sharp-waves following high frequency afferent activation.Brain Res. 1984; 300: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To investigate if a similar phenomenon could be also studied in simpler (anesthetized) preparations and to study how the formation of sequential patterns depends on the brain state, we used population recordings in urethane-anesthetized rats. We found that spontaneous sequences of spiking activity become more similar to preceding stimulus-evoked sequences, particularly in desynchronized brain states. This effect lasted up to several minutes, was N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent, and was observed in both somatosensory and auditory cortices. The phenomenon was similar to what we observed in auditory cortex of awake, passively listening animals. These data suggest that the formation and reverberation of sensory-evoked patterns may partake in learning-related phenomena in multiple neocortical regions of anesthetized animals, which may provide a convenient model for the study of memory mechanisms in the brain. We first investigated changes in spontaneous activity patterns induced by sensory stimulation by recording activity from neuronal populations in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Under urethane anesthesia (Figure 1A), brain activity showed a synchronized state with characteristic slow wave oscillations (Steriade et al., 1993Steriade M. McCormick D.A. Sejnowski T.J. Thalamocortical oscillations in the sleeping and aroused brain.Science. 1993; 262: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (2748) Google Scholar), in which generalized bursts of population activity (UP states) were interspersed with periods of neuronal silence (DOWN states) (Figure 1C, bottom). UP states were accompanied by negative deflections of the local field potential (LFP) (Figure 1C, top), indicative of synchronized synaptic inputs. Urethane promotes a condition of behavioral unconsciousness that closely mimics the full spectrum of natural sleep (Clement et al., 2008Clement E.A. Richard A. Thwaites M. Ailon J. Peters S. Dickson C.T. Cyclic and sleep-like spontaneous alternations of brain state under urethane anaesthesia.PloS One. 2008; 3: e2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), although the duration of DOWN states is reported to be shorter in natural sleep (Johnson et al., 2010Johnson L.A. Euston D.R. Tatsuno M. McNaughton B.L. Stored-trace reactivation in rat prefrontal cortex is correlated with down-to-up state fluctuation density.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as compared to anesthetized conditions. Injection of amphetamine rapidly changed the brain state; within a few minutes after injection, cortical activity transitioned to a strongly desynchronized state, which lasted for at least 30 min (Figures 1B and 1D). Tactile stimulation did not change either synchronized or desynchronized brain states (Figures 1A and 1B, shaded area). Surprisingly, the average stimulus-triggered responses in S1 were very similar in synchronized and desynchronized states, despite large differences in spontaneous neuronal activity among these states (Figures 1E and 1F). To investigate fine-scale temporal changes in spontaneous neuronal activity induced by sensory stimulation, we first calculated the relative latency of each neuron. This reflects its timing in relation to other neurons based on cross-correlogram analysis (see Experimental Procedures; Figure 2A). Figure 2B shows cross-correlograms of 32 neurons from a representative experiment, sorted by latency during the stimulation period after amphetamine injection (middle panel). Consistent with previous results from auditory and visual cortex (Jermakowicz et al., 2009Jermakowicz W.J. Chen X. Khaytin I. Bonds A.B. Casagrande V.A. Relationship between spontaneous and evoked spike-time correlations in primate visual cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 2279-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Luczak et al., 2009Luczak A. Barthó P. Harris K.D. Spontaneous events outline the realm of possible sensory responses in neocortical populations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 413-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), neurons showed similar temporal patterns during spontaneous and stimulus-evoked conditions. For example, neurons that were firing earlier than other neurons during stimulation also tended to fire earlier than other neurons during spontaneous activity before or after tactile stimulation (Figure 2B, top and bottom panel, respectively). This is explicitly shown in Figure 2C, where latencies from stimulation periods are compared to latencies from spontaneous periods for the same neurons. Note that latencies after stimulation are more similar to latencies during the stimulation period than to spontaneous latencies before stimulation (right and left panel in Figure 2C, respectively). We quantified this effect by comparing the correlation coefficient of latencies from stimulated and spontaneous periods. Figure 2D shows such correlation coefficient values for all rats. Consistent with data presented in Figures 2B and 2C, the latency correlation increased significantly after stimulation for all animals under amphetamine (Figure 2D, left panel and Figure 2E, red bar; mean correlation coefficient [corr. coef.] increase = 0.31 ± 0.062 SEM, p = 0.0001; t test). For the animals without amphetamine injection (urethane only), the increase in latency correlation after tactile stimulation was not significant (Figure 2D, right panel and Figure 2E, blue bar; mean corr. coef. change = −0.03 ± 0.06 SEM, p = 0.35; t test; see Figures S4C and S4D available online, ruling out ceiling effect). Similar results were obtained by computing latency from pairwise correlograms (Figure 2E, white bars; mean corr. coef. change: amphetamine (amph) = 0.098 ± 0.023 SEM; urethane (ureth) = 0.049 ± 0.025 SEM; see Experimental Procedures). However, the rats in the urethane-only condition that do show an increase in latency correlation tended to have a more desynchronized brain state (Figure 2F; corr. coef. = −0.66, p = 0.01; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for definition of brain state measure). This indicates that, in the desynchronized state induced by amphetamine or occurring spontaneously under urethane, the brain may be more plastic, such that the repeated tactile stimulation induced more extensive reorganization of spontaneous fine-scale temporal activity patterns. The increased similarity of evoked patterns and poststimulation spontaneous patterns in this preparation could reflect similar processes as that underlying memory formation (Wang and Morris, 2010Wang S.-H. Morris R.G.M. Hippocampal-neocortical interactions in memory formation, consolidation, and reconsolidation.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2010; 61 (C1–C4): 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In order to investigate how spontaneous temporal patterns change over time, we divided each experimental condition into nine periods: three periods during the spontaneous activity before stimulation, three periods of the spontaneous activity occurring between the delivery of stimuli (e.g., the 1 s spontaneous activity intervals between the 1 s intervals of stimulation), and three periods for the spontaneous activity after stimulation (Figure 2G). For each period, the latency correlation between spontaneous and evoked activity was calculated (during the 20 min stimulation period, the stimulus was presented 600 times, and latency for evoked activity was calculated from all those 600 intervals of 1 s; to calculate, for example, latencies from the first spontaneous period during stimulation, we included data from the first 200 1 s intervals between stimulation presentations). In the amphetamine condition in S1, we observed that, as expected, the latency correlation between prestimulus spontaneous and evoked activity did not change significantly (first three points in Figure 2G, left inset; mean slope = −0.01 ± 0.1 SD, p = 0.73, t test). Following this, the latency correlation between spontaneous and evoked activity increases with time during stimulation (three points in the shaded area in Figure 2G, middle inset; mean slope = 0.11 ± 0.12 SD, p = 0.01). Once stimulation ceased, latency correlations decayed gradually (Figure 2G, right inset; mean slope = −0.07 ± 0.08 SD, p = 0.01; see Figure S4A for the same analyses with higher temporal resolution). Interestingly, this slow decrease in reactivation after stimulation is consistent with data from behaving animals, in which most reactivation is observed only within a few minutes after tasks (Euston et al., 2007Euston D.R. Tatsuno M. McNaughton B.L. Fast-forward playback of recent memory sequences in prefrontal cortex during sleep.Science. 2007; 318: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). To quantify the significance of sequence reverberation, we compared averaged values of latency correlations before and after stimulation. The values of latency correlation were significantly higher after stimulation only for S1 in the amphetamine condition (p < 0.0001; t test) but were not significantly different for the urethane-only condition (p > 0.1). Thus, in anesthetized rats injected with amphetamine that induced brain state desynchronization, sensory stimulation caused a gradual reorganization of spontaneous activity patterns in S1, and the “memory” of that stimulation persisted in the following spontaneous activity patterns. As an additional test that stimulus-evoked patterns in S1 are replayed during the following spontaneous activity, we used template-matching analysis as described in studies with behaving animals (Euston et al., 2007Euston D.R. Tatsuno M. McNaughton B.L. Fast-forward playback of recent memory sequences in prefrontal cortex during sleep.Science. 2007; 318: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, Tatsuno et al., 2006Tatsuno M. Lipa P. McNaughton B.L. Methodological considerations on the use of template matching to study long-lasting memory trace replay.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10727-10742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Templates for each data set consisted of average stimulus-triggered activity from 0 to 200 ms after stimulus onset. Figures 3A–3C show template, sample raster plots, and template-matching scores for spontaneous activity before and after stimulation for a representative rat. We found that, in the amphetamine condition (but not the urethane only condition), the number of spontaneous patterns that closely matched the template was higher in the period following tactile stimulation (Figures 3D and 3E; pampth = 0.02, pureth = 0.52; t test). As compared to the results obtained using the latency measure, reverberation disappeared faster after stimulation when analyzed with template matching (Figure S4B). Although it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for this discrepancy, tests on simulated data suggest that latency measure could be more robust in small signal-to-noise regimes and less affected by any time compression of replayed patterns, thus giving better estimation of weak and varying reverbatory activity (Figure S2). Nevertheless, both analysis methods are otherwise consistent in revealing increased reverberation following stimulation in the desynchronized brain state (but not in the urethane-only condition). The foregoing analysis revealed that the timing relations among neurons during spontaneous activity have memory of previous stimulus-evoked temporal patterns. However, given that the number of spikes fired by a particular neuron can be significantly affected by stimulus presentation, we also investigated if firing rate correlations induced by tactile stimulation can be observed in subsequent spontaneous activity. To address this question, we smoothed spike trains with a Gaussian kernel (SD = 130 ms) and calculated the correlation coefficient between all pairs of neurons. The resulting firing rate correlation matrices for units recorded in S1 for evoked and spontaneous periods during amphetamine are shown in Figure 4A. The matrices for the spontaneous period after stimulation are more similar to the matrices for the stimulation period than the matrices for the spontaneous activity before stimulation (Figure 4A). In order to quantify similarities, we calculated the Euclidian distance between the firing rate correlation matrices. For the amphetamine case, the distance between correlation matrices for evoked periods and the following spontaneous periods was smaller than the distance between correlation matrices for evoked and the preceding spontaneous periods for all rats (Figure 4B; p = 0.003; paired t test). However, in the urethane-only condition, we found a nonsignificant increase in similarity between correlation matrices for evoked and following spontaneous periods (S1: p = 0.09; paired t test). Using the correlation coefficient as an alternative measure of similarity between matrices resulted in similar findings (data not shown). Our findings were preserved when the size of the smoothing kernel was varied from 30 to 180 ms. Thus, in the amphetamine case, the firing rate correlations induced by stimuli persist in subsequent spontaneous activity, which is consistent with memory reactivation studies in awake animals (Wilson and McNaughton, 1994Wilson M.A. McNaughton B.L. Reactivation of hippocampal ensemble memories during sleep.Science. 1994; 265: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). In order to quantify the temporal profile of firing rate replay, we used the explained variance (EV) measure, which is a standard method applied to detect memory reactivation in behaving animal studies (Euston et al., 2007Euston D.R.

EV is defined as the square of the partial correlation between firing rate correlation matrices during stimulation and subsequent activity, taking into account the correlations that existed prior to the stimulation. (See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Tatsuno et al., 2006Tatsuno M. Lipa P. McNaughton B.L.

A binless correlation measure reduces the variability of memory reactivation estimates.Stat. Med. 2007; 26: 3997-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar for more details.) Similar to our analyses using latency correlations, evoked and spontaneous periods were subdivided into three smaller time subperiods: the first spontaneous subperiods were used as reference (PRE) for calculating EV on the following subperiods (Figure 4C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In the amphetamine condition, significant firing rate reactivation was observed during the stimulation period in 1 s intervals of spontaneous activity in S1 (Figure 4C; p < 0.05; paired Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The reactivation slowly decreased after stimulation, similar to the decrease observed in the latency correlation analysis (compare Figure 4C with Figure 2G). Under urethane anesthesia alone, we also observed significant firing rate reactivation during stimulation periods, but these did not remain significant after stimulation (data not shown). We next sought to test whether the reactivation described above generalizes to other cortical systems and other mechanisms of desynchronization. We therefore recorded in auditory cortex before, during, and after presentation of tone stimuli and induced desynchronization with amphetamine, tail pinch, or infusion of carbachol in the posterior hypothalamic nucleus (see Experimental Procedures). The sequence of experimental conditions used to record population activity in A1 in urethane anesthetized rats is illustrated in Figures 5A–5D . In every experimental condition, we recorded 10 min of spontaneous activity followed by 20 min of auditory stimulation with pure tones followed by 10 min of spontaneous activity (see Experimental Procedures). Under urethane anesthesia, auditory cortex showed similar activity as in S1: large fluctuation of LFP associated with alternation between UP and DOWN states characteristic of the synchronized brain state (although short periods of spontaneously occurring desynchronized periods were also observed, as reported before in Clement et al., 2008Clement E.A. Richard A. Thwaites M. Ailon J. Peters S. Dickson C.T. Cyclic and sleep-like spontaneous alternations of brain state under urethane anaesthesia.PloS One. 2008; 3: e2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar; Figure 5A). Tail pinch or infusion of carbachol resulted in desynchronization of the brain state (Figure 5B). Injection of amphetamine also induced desynchronization, but in this case, desynchronization was more stable in time (Figure 5C). In the last part of the experiment, each rat was injected with an NMDA receptor antagonist (MK801). After MK801 injection, the auditory cortex persisted in a desynchronized state, although more short periods of neuronal silence resembling DOWN states tended to occur toward the end of the experiment (Figure 5D). To directly compare results obtained in desynchronized brain state in anesthetized animals with processes occurring in awake rats, we also analyzed population activity recorded in auditory cortex in three awake, head-restrained rats (Figure 5E). We did not find significant differences between desynchronized brain states in awake and anesthetized animals based on analysis using the brain state index (Figure 5F; the brain state index is defined as the percent of time that the neuronal activity spent in DOWN states, as previously described in Luczak et al., 2013Luczak A. Bartho P. Harris K.D. Gating of sensory input by spontaneous cortical activity.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 1684-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). Furthermore, stimulus-triggered LFPs were similar for awake and anesthetized animals (Figure 5G; see Figures S5A and S5B for significance tests). For spiking activity, stimulus-triggered onset and offset responses in anesthetized animals showed similar sharp increase and duration as in awake rats, although the amplitude of response was higher in awake animals (Figure 5H; see Figures S5C and S5D for significance tests and Figures S5E–S5G examples of single neuron responses). Altogether, these results suggest that cortical activity in the desynchronized state in anesthetized rats shows similar properties as in awake animals. We next sought to investigate replay of stimulus-evoked patterns across experimental conditions. To do so, we used analyses based on cross-correlograms, as illustrated in Figure 2. Figures 6A–6D show the similarity of stimulus-evoked temporal patterns to spontaneous patterns preceding the epoch of stimulus presentations and following the epoch of stimulus presentations. Consistent with results in S1, the similarity between spontaneous and evoked patterns increased for a majority of animals following the auditory stimulation period in all desynchronized states, regardless of the induction method (tail pinch, carbachol, or amphetamine; Figures 6B and 6C), but this was not observed in the synchronized state (Figure 6A). Injection of the NMDA antagonist MK801 blocked formation of persistent activity patterns, despite desynchronization (Figure 6D). Summary statistics for difference in similarity after-before stimulation are shown by colored bars in Figures 6F–6I (mean corr. coef.after − corr. coef.before ± SEM: Δccure = −0.07 ± 0.04; Δcccarb+tail = 0.08 ± 0.03; Δccamph = 0.14 ± 0.7; ΔccMK = −0.01 ± 0.04; pure-carb = 0.019; pure-ampth = 0.027; pure-MK = 0.27; paired t test). We also verified this effect using a different analysis based on cross-correlograms between all pairs of neurons, which had significant peaks in cross-correlogram. Results were consistent with previous"

These aldehydes form covalent adducts with histidine-containing dipeptides such as carnosine and anserine, which are present in high concentration in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. The metabolic pathways involved in the detoxification and elimination of these conjugates are, however, poorly defined, and their significance in regulating oxidative stress is unclear. Here we report that conjugates of carnosine with aldehydes such as acrolein are produced during normal metabolism and excreted in the urine of mice and adult human non-smokers as carnosine-propanols. Our studies show that the reduction of carnosine-propanals is catalyzed by the enzyme aldose reductase (AR). Carnosine-propanals were converted to carnosine-propanols in the lysates of heart, skeletal muscle, and brain tissue from wild-type (WT) but not AR-null mice. In comparison with WT mice, the urinary excretion of carnosine-propanols was decreased in AR-null mice. Carnosine-propanals formed covalent adducts with nucleophilic amino acids leading to the generation of carnosinylated proteins. Deletion of AR increased the abundance of proteins bound to carnosine in skeletal muscle, brain, and heart of aged mice and promoted the accumulation of carnosinylated proteins in hearts subjected to global ischemia ex vivo. Perfusion with carnosine promoted post-ischemic functional recovery in WT but not in AR-null mouse hearts. Collectively, these findings reveal a previously unknown metabolic pathway for the removal of carnosine-propanal conjugates and suggest a new role of AR as a critical regulator of protein carnosinylation and carnosine-mediated tissue protection.Background: Lipid peroxidation generates unsaturated aldehydes that form conjugates with histidyl dipeptides.Results: Carnosine-aldehyde conjugates form covalent adducts with proteins and are reduced by aldose reductase.Conclusion: Detoxification of carnosine-aldehyde by aldose reductase prevents protein carnosinylation.Significance: Aldose reductase prevents tissue injury due to aldehyde-carnosine conjugates.

Conclusion: Detoxification of carnosine-aldehyde by aldose reductase prevents protein carnosinylation. Significance: Aldose reductase prevents tissue injury due to aldehyde-carnosine conjugates. Short-chain aliphatic aldehydes are generated by several biochemical reactions such as the peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and phospholipids, glycation of proteins, and oxidation of amino acids (1.Esterbauer H.

Because aldehydes are highly reactive, they are rapidly metabolized. In most cells aldehydes are either oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenases or reduced by aldehyde reductases (16.Srivastava S.

In addition, unsaturated aldehydes such as acrolein and HNE form covalent conjugates with reduced glutathione (GSH). This conjugative reaction is further enhanced by glutathione S-transferases. Our previous studies have shown that the glutathione conjugates of aldehydes are further metabolized by a reductive transformation catalyzed by aldose reductase (AR) (17.Srivastava S. Watowich S.J.

These observations support the view that reduction diminishes the ability of aldehyde-glutathione conjugates to induce tissue toxicity. In addition to glutathione, aldehydes also form stable conjugates with carnosine (20.Zhou S. Decker E.A.

It is synthesized in tissues with high rates of glycolysis such as the anaerobic white skeletal muscle of birds, horses, and pigs. It is currently believed that during high anaerobic activity carnosine prevents tissue acidification by buffering changes in intracellular pH (23.Hipkiss A.R. Carnosine and its possible roles in nutrition and health.Adv. Food Nutr. Res. 2009; 57: 87-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, high levels of carnosine and related histidyl peptides (anserine, homocarnosine) are also present in aerobic tissues such as the heart and the brain, suggesting that carnosine might have other functions as well. Previous studies have shown that carnosine protects against ischemic injury (24.Lee J.W. Miyawaki H. Bobst E.V. Hester J.D. Ashraf M. Bobst A.M.

Collectively, these findings indicate that in addition to buffering intracellular pH, carnosine might have an antioxidant role in removing aldehydes (31.Carini M. Aldini G. Beretta G. Arlandini E.

Mass Spectrom. 2003; 38: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the metabolic fate of aldehyde-carnosine conjugates is unknown, and it is unclear whether, like glutathione-aldehyde conjugates, the carnosine-aldehyde conjugates are also enzymatically reduced and whether this metabolism regulates the antioxidant effects of carnosine. Accordingly, the current study was designed to elucidate the metabolism of carnosine-aldehyde conjugates. Our results show that carnosine-derived conjugates are major urinary products of unsaturated aldehydes such as acrolein and that these conjugates are reduced by AR before excretion in urine. Moreover, we found that enzymatic reduction by AR prevents these conjugates from modifying proteins and inducing tissue injury. Carnosine, dl-glyceraldehyde, dithiothreitol (DTT), NADPH, EDTA, tyrosine-histidine, homocarnosine, anserine, hydralazine, pyridoxamine, aminoguanidine, and nonafluoropentanoic acid were obtained from Sigma. Anti-protein-acrolein antibody was purchased from U. S. Biological. The anti-protein-carnosine antibody was raised against carnosine conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) that was a kind gift from Dr. Frank Margolis, University of Maryland. Synthetic model peptides Ac-RVAAKH, Ac-RVCAKH, and Ac-MCAAR and the chemical analogues of carnosine, octyl-d-carnosine, were purchased from AAPPTec, LLC (Louisville, KY). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus) reagents and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The AR-null mice were obtained from Dr. Stephen S. Chung, University of Hong Kong. Mice were treated in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, 1996) as adopted and promulgated by the National Institutes of Health. Treatment protocols were approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For all the experiments, acrolein was freshly prepared by the acid hydrolysis of diethyl acetal (pH 3.0) for 1 h at room temperature. To synthesize conjugates, acrolein was incubated with an equimolar concentration of carnosine, anserine, homocarnosine, aminoguanidine, hydralazine, or pyridoxamine in 10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) at 37 °C for 3–24 h and purified by HPLC as described previously (32.Orioli M.

Briefly, the conjugates were separated using a C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm; particle size 5 μm) with a Waters (Milford, MA) 1525 Binary HPLC equipped with a Waters 2487 Dual wavelength detector. The conjugates were eluted using a gradient consisting of 100% water containing 5 mm nonafluoropentanoic acid (solvent A) and 100% acetonitrile (solvent B) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The gradient was established such that solvent B reached 15% in 10 min and was then held at this value for 50 min. The absorbance of the eluate was measured at 210 and 234 nm. The conjugates of carnosine were analyzed using a Micromass ZMD mass spectrometer (Manchester UK) in the positive ion mode. The spectrometer was calibrated using NaCsI with the calibration routine included in the MassLynx 3.4 software. Samples were diluted in 70% water, 30% acetonitrile, and the solution was infused into the mass spectrometer using a glass syringe and a Harvard infusion pump at a rate of 10 μl/min. Tuning conditions were as follows: capillary 2.9 kV, cone 34 V, extractor 9 V, Rf lens 0.9 V, source temperature 100 °C, desolvation gas 200 °C, low mass resolution 15 relative setting, high mass resolution 15.2, ion energy 0.3 V, multiplier 650 relative setting. For accurate mass data, HPLC-purified fractions were minimally diluted with 70% water, 30% acetonitrile and analyzed using a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL mass spectrometer coupled with a LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. Samples were analyzed by chip-based electrospray ionization using an Advion (Ithaca, NY) TriVersa NanoMate under the control of CHIP SOFT instrument control software. The ionization parameters were as follows: sample volume 6 μl, spray duration 3.5 min, N2 pressure 0.50 p.s.i., voltage 1.6 kV, and positive polarity.

Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2010; 878: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the human urine was spiked with internal standard [13C3]HPMA and applied to solid-phase extraction cartridge. Fractions containing HPMA conjugates were separated on an HPLC column fitted with a UV detector. HPMA was detected after derivatization with bistrimethylsilytrifluoroacetamide for 1 h at 70 °C by GC/MS (Agilent Technologies). Ions of m/z 366 (endogenous) and 369 ([13C3]HPMA, internal standard) were monitored for measuring HPMA. Proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-carnosine antibody from ischemic hearts were separated on SDS-PAGE and identified by silver staining. Individual protein bands were excised and de-stained with 15 mm potassium ferricyanide, 50 mm sodium thiosulfate in water. The gel pieces were then washed twice with water and cut in half. One half of the band was digested with 60 ng of trypsin (Promega) as described previously (35.Vladykovskaya E. Sithu S.D. Haberzettl P. Wickramasinghe N.S. Merchant M.L. Hill B.G. McCracken J. Agarwal A. Dougherty S. Gordon S.A. Schuschke D.A. Barski O.A. O'Toole T. D'Souza S.E. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.

Chem. 2012; 287: 11398-11409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); the other half of each band was digested with 60 ng of Arg-C (Sigma) in 50 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate. After digestion, peptides were sequentially extracted from the gel pieces using 5% v/v formic acid and acetonitrile (36.Jensen O.N. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Protein Analysis by Mass Spectrometry. 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar). The extracts were dried, redissolved in 25 μl of 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and filtered through 0.2-μm cellulose syringe filters. The proteolytic digests were separated by a linear 30-min gradient (2–60% acetonitrile) using a Proxeon Easy nLC-1000 UPLC fitted with an Acclaim PepMap 100 (75 μm × 2 cm, nanoViper; C18, 3 μm, 100 Å) trap and Acclaim PepMap RSLC (50 μm × 15 cm, nanoViper; C18, 2 μm, 100 Å) separating column before MS data collection using a Thermo Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap ELITE hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) interfaced with a nanospray FLEX ion source operated in a data-dependent manner. MS data were collected on the Orbitrap ELITE with the MS scan from 300 to 2000 m/z in FTMS and a normal mass range with 120,000 resolution, full scan, positive polarity, and centroided data. The chromatography option was enabled on MS scans with an expected peak width at full width half mass (FWHM) of 10 s and a minimum signal threshold of 1000; the correlation option was used with a maximum area ratio to previous scan of one. Monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled. For MS2 data collection, dynamic exclusion was used with a repeat count of 1, 30-s repeat duration, exclusion list size of 50, and exclusion duration of 180 s; exclusion was +1.5 by mass. The “Predict ion injection time” and “Enable preview mode for FTMS master scans” options were enabled. Dependent MS2 scans were collected on the top three peaks of the MS scan with both high energy collision dissociation (HCD) and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) fragmentation. The three HCD scans were acquired before the three ETD scans. The MS2 scans were acquired in FTMS with normal mass range, 60,000 resolution, and centroid data type. For collection of HCD data, the following instrument settings were used: normalized collision energy of 35, activation time of 0.1 ms, isolation width 2.0 m/z, default charge state of 2, minimum signal threshold for fragmentation of 500, and first mass in spectrum fixed at 100 m/z. For collection of ETD MS2 data, the activation time was 100 ms, isolation width 2.0 m/z, default charge state 2, minimum signal threshold for fragmentation 500. The first mass in spectrum was fixed at 100 m/z. The MS2 data were analyzed by the Proteome Discoverer (Version 1.3.0.339). Spectra were filtered by mass range (350–5000 Da), total intensity threshold (500 ion counts), and minimum peak counts (3.LoPachin R.M. Gavin T. Petersen D.R. Barber D.S. Molecular mechanisms of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and acrolein toxicity. Nucleophilic targets and adduct formation.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2009; 22: 1499-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Scan event filters were used to define HCD and ETD spectra. The Fourier transform-only spectra were filtered with a signal/noise ratio threshold of 4. Non-fragment filters were used to clip precursor spectra from 2.5 Da before and 5.5 Da after precursor masses. Non-fragment filters were used to remove charge reduced precursors and to remove FT-precursor overtones. All spectra were normalized, and a Top N Peaks filter of 10 within a 100-Da mass window was used to simplify data submitted for analysis. For Mascot analysis a SwissProt database selected for the Mus musculus taxanomy was used with Arg-C or trypsin enzyme designation, precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance of 0.05 Da, and a peptide ion score cutoff of 10 was used to filter peptide assignments. Dynamic modifications to amino acids were selected for three adducts including C12H18N4O4 (+264.122 Da), C15H20N4O4 (+302.138Da), and C15H22N4O5 (+320.148 Da). All assigned peptide spectra were filtered for false discovery rates of 0.01 using Peptide Validator and again using a decoy database. For Sequest analysis, a mouse refseq database (Version 20120611.fasta) was downloaded from UniProt, and using either Arg-C or trypsin enzymes, 500 maximum peptides were considered with a maximum peptide output of 10. The absolute XCorr threshold was set to 0.4, and fragment ion cutoff at 0.1%. All other settings were similar to Mascot searches. Protein identification was accepted if it could be established at >95.0% probability and contained at least 1 or more identified peptides below the 1% false discovery rate. Data were aggregated and used to make lists of high probability/high confidence peptide/protein assignments. To generate carnosinylated protein, purified carnosine-propanal conjugates were incubated with 1 mg of fat-free BSA at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the samples were filtered through 3000 Mr cutoff filters, and the carnosinylated proteins were visualized on Western blots developed using anti-protein-carnosine and anti-propanal antibodies. For studying the reactivity of carnosine-propanals, the synthetic model peptide Ac-RVCAKH (10 nmol) was dissolved in 25 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm DTT. The reaction mixture was incubated at 70 °C for 30 min. The samples were then cooled and incubated with 3 mm purified carnosine-propanals or carnosine-propanol for indicated times. The products were then identified by electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (ESI+/MS). After anesthesia (sodium pentobarbital, 60 mg/kg body weight; heparin, 10 units/g body weight), the thorax of mice (8–12 weeks of age) was opened, and the hearts were removed and immediately placed in ice-cold modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer. The composition of the Krebs-Henseleit buffer was 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose (pH 7.4). The buffer was heated to 37 °C and continuously gassed (95% O2, 5% CO2). Hearts were continuously perfused at a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg in the Langendorff mode and after 30 min of perfusion subjected to 30 min of ischemia and 45 min of reperfusion in the absence or presence of carnosine (1 mm). After the experimental protocol, the hearts were removed and snap-frozen in liquid N2. Functional recovery of the hearts was measured by placing a food-grade plastic wrap, fluid-filled balloon in the left ventricle through an incision in the left atrium and inflating the balloon to a pressure of 5–8 mm Hg. Left ventricular pressure was recorded using an APT300 pressure transducer (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) connected to a ML221 bridge amplifier, a PowerLab 16/30 A/D board, and a PC running LabChart Pro v7 (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Perfusion flow rate was monitored using a 1PXN inline probe and TS410 flowmeter (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY) and was typically between 1.5 and 2 ml/min. Left ventricle developed pressure was derived from the pressure trace as the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures. Perfusates were collected on ice, and the levels of creatinine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase were measured using kits purchased from Thermo-Electron. In a separate series of experiments, WT hearts were perfused 15 min and then perfused another 10 min without or with acrolein (10 μm). Hearts were removed and immediately snap-frozen. Tissues were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (1:100). The homogenates were centrifuged for 25 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatants were incubated with the anti-protein-carnosine antibody overnight and then with agarose A beads for 3 h at 4 °C.

Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of previously untrained women (n=15; age: 27±8 yr, BMI: 29±6 kg/m(2)) before and after 6 wk of aerobic interval training. The fiber type-specific SC response to training was analyzed using immunofluorescent microscopy of muscle cross sections. Following training, the number of SCs associated with fibers expressing myosin heavy-chain type I and II isoforms (hybrid fibers) increased (pre: 0.062±0.035 SC/hybrid fiber; post: 0.38±0.063 SC/hybrid fiber; P<0.01). In addition, there was a greater number of MyoD(+)/Pax7(-) SCs, indicative of differentiating SCs, associated with hybrid fibers (0.18±0.096 MyoD(+)/Pax7(-) SC/hybrid fiber) compared to type I (0.015±0.00615 MyoD(+)/Pax7(-) SC/type I fiber) or II (0.012±0.00454 MyoD(+)/Pax7(-) SC/type II fiber) fibers (P<0.05). There was also a training-induced increase in the number of hybrid fibers containing centrally located nuclei (15.1%) compared to either type I (3.4%) or II fibers (3.6%) (P<0.01). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that SCs contribute to the remodeling of muscle fibers even in the absence of hypertrophy."

Molecular replacement experiments revealed that the LRRTM2 extracellular domain is sufficient for LTP, probably because it mediates binding to neurexins (Nrxs). Examination of surface expression of endogenous AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in cultured neurons suggests that LRRTMs maintain newly delivered AMPARs at synapses after LTP induction. LRRTMs are also required for LTP of mature synapses on adult CA1 pyramidal neurons, indicating that the block of LTP in neonatal synapses by LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 KD is not due to impairment of synapse maturation."

Visual scenes are correlated in space and time due to the properties of environmental conditions, objects, eye movements, and self motion (Field, 1987Field D.J.

Local luminance and contrast in natural images.Vision Res. 2006; 46: 1585-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Because of this statistical regularity, it has long been thought that the visual system might improve its efficiency and performance by adjusting its response properties to the recent history of visual input (Barlow et al., 1957Barlow H.B.

Given the recent stimulus distribution, response properties change over multiple timescales to encode more information and remove predictable parts of the stimulus (Fairhall et al., 2001Fairhall A.L.

Underlying studies of adaptation is the idea that early sensory systems should maximize information transmission for processing in the higher brain (Atick, 1992Atick J.

Studies in the higher brain and behavior often have a different perspective: the goal is to generate a behavior given a stimulus (Körding and Wolpert, 2006Körding K.P. Wolpert D.M.

Accordingly, such studies have revealed that choosing the appropriate action benefits from predicting future stimuli by performing an ongoing inference based on the prior probability of sensory input. Recent results indicate that many ganglion cells encode specific features with a sharp threshold, implying that these ganglion cells make a decision as to the presence of a feature (Olveczky et al., 2003Olveczky B.P. Baccus S.A. Meister M. Segregation of object and background motion in the retina.Nature. 2003; 423: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2012Zhang Y. Kim I.-J. Sanes J.R. Meister M. The most numerous ganglion cell type of the mouse retina is a selective feature detector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2391-E2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). If so, one might expect that retinal plasticity also take advantage of the principles of signal detection and optimal inference. At the photoreceptor-to-bipolar-cell synapse, even though at the dimmest light level the synapse threshold is close to the optimal level for signal detection, it does not appear that any adjustment occurs due to the prior signal probability (Field and Rieke, 2002Field G.D. Rieke F. Nonlinear signal transfer from mouse rods to bipolar cells and implications for visual sensitivity.Neuron. 2002; 34: 773-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This problem, however, has not been explored in ganglion cells. Given the complex circuitry of the inner retina and the different types of ganglion cell plasticity (Hosoya et al., 2005Hosoya T. Baccus S.A. Meister M. Dynamic predictive coding by the retina.Nature. 2005; 436: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, Kastner and Baccus, 2011Kastner D.B. Baccus S.A.

Baccus S.A. Meister M. Retinal adaptation to object motion.Neuron. 2007; 56: 689-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we examined this plasticity in the context of both adaptation and signal detection. Here, we systematically mapped the spatial arrangement of plasticity in retinal ganglion cells, finding that many ganglion cells adapted to a localized stimulus but sensitized in the surrounding region. A computational model composed of independently adapting excitatory subunits, producing localized adaptation, and larger adapting inhibitory subunits, producing sensitization, captured the spatiotemporal properties of this plasticity. Using knowledge of the detailed computation, we then combined theories of signal detection and optimal inference to account for several properties of sensitization. This analysis indicated that sensitization creates a regional prediction of future input based on prior information of local signal correlations in space and time. We then test this theory in a more natural context by showing that object-motion-sensitive (OMS) ganglion cells use sensitization to predict the location of a camouflaged object. Finally, we show that sensitization requires GABAergic inhibition and that different levels of inhibition can account for differences in sensitization between ganglion cell types. Together, these results show how two functional roles of plasticity are combined in a single cell—to adapt to the range of signals and predict when those signals are more likely to occur. Furthermore, these results establish a functional role for adapting inhibition in predicting the likelihood of future sensory input based on the recent stimulus history. We measured the spatiotemporal region for which statistics control the sensitivity of a cell: the adaptive field (AF). Previous measurements of spatial properties of the AF focused primarily on fast adaptation—changes in sensitivity occurring within the integration time of a cell. These fast, suppressive, effects in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus extend beyond the receptive field center (Bonin et al., 2005Bonin V. Mante V. Carandini M.

Lateral interactions at inner plexiform layer of vertebrate retina: antagonistic responses to change.Science. 1972; 175: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Much less effort has been devoted to measurements of the AF as to changes in sensitivity lasting longer than the cell’s integration time. Recent results have shown that delayed changes in sensitivity in salamander, mouse, and rabbit retinas have two opposing signs, adaptation and sensitization (Kastner and Baccus, 2011Kastner D.B. Baccus S.A. Coordinated dynamic encoding in the retina using opposing forms of plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although it is known that small regions of the ganglion cell receptive field adapt somewhat independently (Brown and Masland, 2001Brown S.P. Masland R.H. Spatial scale and cellular substrate of contrast adaptation by retinal ganglion cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), spatial properties of sensitization have not been measured. To measure prolonged changes in sensitivity at different spatial locations, we presented a low-contrast flickering checkerboard. Every 20 s, one region of space changed to high contrast for 4 s (Figures 1A and 1B ). The high-contrast stimulus was presented at different locations, allowing for the creation of a spatial map of slow changes in sensitivity. We compared the firing rate during two time intervals after the high contrast spot disappeared: Learly, 0.5 to 3 s after the transition to all low contrast, and Llate, 13.5 to 16 s after the transition to all low contrast, a time that approximated the steady state. Fast Off adapting and sensitizing cells are two defined cell types that each form an independent mosaic in the salamander retina (Kastner and Baccus, 2011Kastner D.B. Baccus S.A. Coordinated dynamic encoding in the retina using opposing forms of plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In response to a spatially global transition between high and low temporal contrasts, adapting cells decrease their sensitivity following a high-contrast stimulus, whereas sensitizing cells increase their sensitivity. Fast Off cells that adapted to a global contrast change also adapted when the high-contrast spot was directly over their receptive field center. However, when the high-contrast spot neighbored their receptive field center, they sensitized, increasing their response during Learly relative to Llate (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1E). Thus, the AF of this type of cell exhibited spatial antagonism, showing central adaptation but peripheral sensitization. Sensitizing cells also had a spatially varied response to a local high-contrast spot. These cells sensitized both in their central and surround regions (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1E). However, on examination of the firing rate at an earlier time, from 0 to 0.5 s after the transition from high contrast (L0–0.5), sensitizing cells also adapted in their center (Figure 1D). Thus, both cell types had an adapting center and sensitizing surround, although with apparently different dynamics to their adaptation (Figures 1C and 1D). In comparison, all On cells had a spatially monophasic AF, adapting in both the central and surround regions (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1E). To determine whether local changes in visual sensitivity accompanied the changes in firing rate, we computed the sensitivity at each spatial location during Learly and Llate (see Experimental Procedures). In all cell types, a prolonged adaptive change in sensitivity, as measured using a spatiotemporal linear-nonlinear (LN) model, underlay the changes in activity (Figure S1 available online). Therefore, three different populations of cells—fast Off adapting, fast Off sensitizing, and On cells—had distinct spatiotemporal plasticity, with Off cells exhibiting center-surround AFs. To gain insight into both the computation performed by the AF and its potential mechanisms, we modeled the center-surround AF by extending a previous model that produced sensitization (Kastner and Baccus, 2011Kastner D.B. Baccus S.A. Coordinated dynamic encoding in the retina using opposing forms of plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this model, adapting excitation and inhibition combine so that a high-contrast stimulus causes inhibitory transmission to adapt, thus reducing inhibition and generating a residual sensitization after the high contrast ceases. To extend the previous model, we added adapting spatial subunits for both excitatory and inhibitory pathways (Figure 2A). Excitatory subunits, representing bipolar cells, had receptive fields smaller than that of the ganglion cell, and inhibitory subunits were three times larger than excitatory subunits (Figure 2A). This size ratio was taken from a difference of Gaussians fit to the center-surround AF (Figure 1E); otherwise, the parameters of the model were taken from previous uniform-field experiments with fast Off sensitizing cells (Kastner and Baccus, 2011Kastner D.B. Baccus S.A. Coordinated dynamic encoding in the retina using opposing forms of plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the model, each excitatory subunit received spatially weighted input from adapting inhibitory subunits. The ganglion cell then received spatially weighted input from the adapting excitatory subunits (Figure 2B). With a stimulus similar to that shown in Figure 1, the model produces an output that either adapts or sensitizes depending upon the location of the high contrast (Figure 2C), consistent with the responses of cells with center-surround AFs. Thus, a different spatial scale of adapting excitation and inhibition yields a center-surround AF. Because the three types of AF had distinct properties, one might expect that different circuitry would be required to generate the different AFs. However, we reproduced all three AFs by simply changing the strength of the inhibitory weighting on to the excitatory subunits (Figure 2D). The AFs of sensitizing cells resulted from the strongest adapting inhibition, center-surround AFs resulted from intermediate inhibition, and an exclusively adapting monophasic AF resulted from the weakest inhibition. Thus, all three AFs, as well as intermediate examples not encountered experimentally, could arise solely by changing the strength of inhibition. The AF model predicts several distinct features of the data. Sensitizing cells produce less sensitization when they were directly centered under a high-contrast spot than when the spot was slightly offset from the receptive field center (Figures 1E, 2D, S1A, and S1B). The model also predicts that when the high-contrast region was further from the receptive field center, the cell had a larger steady-state response at low contrast than at high but an elevated response at the transition to both low and high contrast (Figure 2C). This occurs because, in the periphery of the receptive field center, inhibition exceeds excitation by virtue of the greater spatial spread of inhibition (Figure 2A). However, a delay in inhibitory transmission causes excitation to be transiently greater than inhibition at the onset of high contrast. Thus, a model with independently adapting excitation and inhibition predicts multiple distinct spatiotemporal properties of the AF. The AF model contains subunits with independent plasticity, with the final response exhibiting the summed adaptive behavior of each subunit. Because these subunits are smaller than the receptive field center, the model predicts that individual regions of the response of the cell may sensitize, even when the overall firing rate adapts (Figures 2B and 2C). We tested whether the AF model, fit to a coarser spatial stimulus (Figure 1), would predict changes in sensitivity at a high spatial resolution within a single cell without refitting the model. We stimulated the retina with a low-contrast white noise stimulus composed of concentric flickering annuli centered on a single ganglion cell (Figures 3A and 3B ). In the central 200 μm, every 20 s, the stimulus was a uniform circle that flickered with high contrast for 4 s. The diameter of the high-contrast spot was smaller than the receptive field center of a cell. We measured subcellular changes in sensitivity following high contrast during Learly and Llate using a spatiotemporal LN model, similar to that in Figure S1A, except that each spatial region represented an annulus (Figure 3C). Cells with a center-surround AF showed local adaptation and peripheral sensitization even within the receptive field center, just as predicted by the AF model. Thus, even though the AF model was fit using different experimental data (full field and checkerboard changes in contrast), the model predicted subcellular adaptation and sensitization using concentric annuli. Previously, it was shown that adaptation occurs at a subcellular scale (Brown and Masland, 2001Brown S.P. Masland R.H. Spatial scale and cellular substrate of contrast adaptation by retinal ganglion cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The present result shows that interneurons contribute spatially localized plasticity both for adaptation and sensitization. Under natural viewing conditions, rapid changes in contrast occur due to frequent eye movements (Frazor and Geisler, 2006Frazor R.A. Geisler W.S. Local luminance and contrast in natural images.Vision Res. 2006; 46: 1585-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the model fit to the localized step change in contrast (Figures 1A and 1B) predicted the response when all regions were activated together by a uniform field stimulus whose contrast changed with a broad temporal bandwidth. We presented a uniform field Gaussian stimulus where the temporal contrast changed randomly every 0.5 s (Figure 4A). We then computed a temporal filter representing the average effect of a brief increase in contrast by correlating the spiking response with the random sequence of contrast (Figure 4B). This temporal filter represented the temporal AF, which is the spatial average of the spatiotemporal AF. This computation measures the average contribution of both increases and decreases in contrast, analogous to how the linear receptive field averages both increases and decreases in intensity. These functions had a large peak in the first time bin, from 0 to 0.5 s, because higher contrast invariably produces a higher firing rate. To examine the temporal AF, we focused on the temporal filter outside of the first 0.5 s, representing how the recent history of contrast outside the cell’s integration time influenced the firing rate. The three cell types had distinct temporal AFs (Figures 4B and 4C). On cells had a slow negative monophasic filter, indicating that a brief increase in contrast decreased activity between 0.5 and 3 s. Sensitizing cells had a biphasic filter, such that elevations of contrast initially decreased activity, but only for a duration of up to 1 s. With a delay of ∼1 s, contrast, on average, increased activity, consistent with previous results showing that the onset of sensitization occurs with a time constant of 0.55 s (Kastner and Baccus, 2011Kastner D.B. Baccus S.A. Coordinated dynamic encoding in the retina using opposing forms of plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The effect then decayed after ∼3 s. Adapting Off cells had a temporal AF that was negative and monophasic but with a more rapid decay than that of On cells (Figure 4C). Just as with the spatial AF, where adapting Off cells showed a mixture of adaptation and sensitization, the temporal AF of adapting Off cells was a mixture of the time courses of the two extremes. Although sensitization did not completely cancel adaptation, adaptation was reduced at later times. We then evaluated whether the AF model could reproduce the different temporal AFs using the same stimulus that rapidly changed in contrast (Figure 4A). For each of the three cell types, we used a model with a different strength of adapting inhibition but with otherwise identical spatial parameters, fit using only the spatial map of the AF (Figure 1). We found that a different weighting of adapting inhibition in the model reproduced the different behaviors of the three cell types, indicating that the same circuitry that underlies the spatial AF can sufficiently account for the temporal AF. In addition, the time course of adaptation of adapting Off cells, which lies in between that of On cells and sensitizing Off cells, can be explained by an intermediate level of adapting inhibition. Although the full spatiotemporal model (Figure 2) produces more complex behavior, such as asymmetric responses at increases and decreases in contrast, the combined effects of the subunits in the spatiotemporal model predict the response to rapidly varying contrast. The interplay between local and global contrast changes has recently been explored during steady-state adaptation (Garvert and Gollisch, 2013Garvert M.M. Gollisch T. Local and global contrast adaptation in retinal ganglion cells.Neuron. 2013; 77: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the dynamic changes studied here, because the model with independent subunits fit to local adaptation predicts the sum total adaptation for spatially global stimuli, we conclude qualitatively that excitatory and inhibitory subunits within the AF adapt independently. Having characterized the combined spatiotemporal computation of adaptation and sensitization, we considered the functional relevance of sensitization within the AF. Many sensory neurons encode specific visual features using a high and sharp threshold, signaling when the stimulus matches that feature (Ringach and Malone, 2007Ringach D.L. Malone B.J. The operating point of the cortex: neurons as large deviation detectors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7673-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the retina, for example, OMS (Olveczky et al., 2003Olveczky B.P. Baccus S.A. Meister M. Segregation of object and background motion in the retina.Nature. 2003; 423: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and W3 cells (Zhang et al., 2012Zhang Y. Kim I.-J. Sanes J.R. Meister M. The most numerous ganglion cell type of the mouse retina is a selective feature detector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E2391-E2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) selectively report the presence of differential motion. We assessed how one aspect of feature selectivity related to sensitization by measuring both differential motion sensitivity and sensitization in the same cells. We found that fast Off adapting cells were OMS cells, whereas fast Off sensitizing cells were not (Figures 5 and S2). Although they receive different levels of peripheral inhibition, the two cell types fire synchronously in response to a stimulus with no spatial structure and thus respond to the same local stimulus features (Kastner and Baccus, 2011Kastner D.B. Baccus S.A. Coordinated dynamic encoding in the retina using opposing forms of plasticity.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role as a feature detector, Off cells had a more strongly rectified nonlinearity than On cells using a previously described index of rectification. This index measures the logarithm of the ratio of the maximum slope of the nonlinearity to the slope at zero input (Chichilnisky and Kalmar, 2002Chichilnisky E.J. Kalmar R.S. Functional asymmetries in ON and OFF ganglion cells of primate retina.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2737-2747PubMed Google Scholar). Off cells had an index of 2.2 ± 0.1 (n = 80), whereas On cells had an index of 1.3 ± 0.2 (n = 9), meaning that, relative to the slope at an input of zero (the average input), Off cells increased their slope approximately eight times more than On cells. To better understand the function of sensitization, we formalized the apparent role of fast Off cells as feature detectors using a simple model of optimal signal detection that changes with stimulus history. In a signal detection problem, the position of the optimal threshold depends upon the distributions of signal and noise, as has been examined at the photoreceptor-to-bipolar-cell synapse (Field and Rieke, 2002Field G.D. Rieke F. Nonlinear signal transfer from mouse rods to bipolar cells and implications for visual sensitivity.Neuron. 2002; 34: 773-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although the threshold at the photoreceptor-to-bipolar-cell synapse does not appear to change according to the prior probability of photons, we considered that changes in the response function of ganglion cells reflects the changing likelihood of a signal. By recording intracellularly from Off bipolar cells in response to a repeated Gaussian 5% contrast stimulus, we found that the noise was 0.44 ± 0.12 (n = 5, mean ± SD) times the SD of the recorded membrane potential fluctuations (Figures 6A and S3A). Thus, for weak, low-contrast signals the probability distribution of an input, ν, given the presence of a signal, p(ν|s), greatly overlaps with the probability distribution of that same input in the presence of only noise, p(ν|η). This overlap creates a benefit from a careful threshold placement to discriminate between the two conditions. Although both positive and negative signals are distinguishable from noise, we focused on positive signal deviations because many ganglion cells have monotonic response curves. The probability that a particular voltage arises from the signal distribution depends on the prior probability, p(s), of a signal. Thus, when p(s) increases, the optimal threshold decreases (Field and Rieke, 2002Field G.D. Rieke F. Nonlinear signal transfer from mouse rods to bipolar cells and implications for visual sensitivity.Neuron. 2002; 34: 773-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). What then would lead to an increase in the prior signal probability? For the visual system, an important source of prior information comes from the strong spatial and temporal correlations present in natural visual stimuli (Geisler and Perry, 2009Geisler W.S. Perry J.S. Contour statistics in natural images: grouping across occlusions.Vis. Neurosci. 2009; 26: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Objects do not suddenly disappear; therefore, once detected, they are highly likely to be present nearby in space. We incorporated this natural visual prior probability into a spatiotemporal version of an optimal inference model (Figure 6B), similar to that used previously (DeWeese and Zador, 1998DeWeese M. Zador A.M. Asymmetric dynamics in optimal variance adaptation.Neural Comput. 1998; 10: 1179-1202Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Wark"
https://openalex.org/W2015196605,"Effective involvement of VKORC1L1 in vitamin K epoxide reductase activity, target of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), is still unclear. Results: VKORC1L1 is not inhibited by VKAs and catalyzes VKOR activity in extrahepatic tissues. Conclusion: During long term anticoagulation the limited unwanted side effects of VKAs are due to VKORC1L1. Significance: Potential pharmaco-toxicologic effects of specific VKORC1L1 inhibitors should be assessed. Vitamin K is involved in the γ-carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent proteins, and vitamin K epoxide is a by-product of this reaction. Due to the limited intake of vitamin K, its regeneration is necessary and involves vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR) activity. This activity is known to be supported by VKORC1 protein, but recently a second gene, VKORC1L1, appears to be able to support this activity when the encoded protein is expressed in HEK293T cells. Nevertheless, this protein was described as being responsible for driving the vitamin K-mediated antioxidation pathways. In this paper we precisely analyzed the catalytic properties of VKORC1L1 when expressed in Pichia pastoris and more particularly its susceptibility to vitamin K antagonists. Vitamin K antagonists are also inhibitors of VKORC1L1, but this enzyme appears to be 50-fold more resistant to vitamin K antagonists than VKORC1. The expression of Vkorc1l1 mRNA was observed in all tissues assayed, i.e. in C57BL/6 wild type and VKORC1-deficient mouse liver, lung, and testis and rat liver, lung, brain, kidney, testis, and osteoblastic cells. The characterization of VKOR activity in extrahepatic tissues demonstrated that a part of the VKOR activity, more or less important according to the tissue, may be supported by VKORC1L1 enzyme especially in testis, lung, and osteoblasts. Therefore, the involvement of VKORC1L1 in VKOR activity partly explains the low susceptibility of some extrahepatic tissues to vitamin K antagonists and the lack of effects of vitamin K antagonists on the functionality of the vitamin K-dependent protein produced by extrahepatic tissues such as matrix Gla protein or osteocalcin."

Visualization of distinct entities of the SecYEG translocon during translocation and integration of bacterial proteins.Mol. Biol.

Previously, LacY has been shown to require the signal recognition particle (SRP)/FtsY components and the Sec translocase for membrane insertion (40.Macfarlane J. Müller M.

SecY alterations that impair membrane protein folding and generate a membrane stress.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, the involvement of YidC in the folding of LacY rather than insertion has been shown (32.Nagamori S. Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. Role of YidC in folding of polytopic membrane proteins.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether one or more of the periplasmic loops of LacY require YidC for translocation or whether the helix packing of LacY is perturbed by YidC depletion. To define a precise role of YidC in the insertion and folding of the galactoside/H+ symporter LacY, we examined the translocation of each of the six periplasmic loops of LacY utilizing a Cys-based alkylation method (44.Neale E.J. Rong H. Cockcroft C.J. Sivaprasadarao A. Mapping the membrane-aqueous border for the voltage-sensing domain of a potassium channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37597-37604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The findings demonstrate that YidC is not required for translocation of the periplasmic loops of Sec-dependent LacY but is necessary for proper folding. YidC can be disulfide-cross-linked to LacY, indicating that YidC makes contact with LacY during membrane biogenesis. Furthermore, YidC has the capacity to translocate a domain added to the middle cytoplasmic loop of a LacY chimera with an M13 procoat insertion. Membrane insertion of the procoat domain is strictly YidC-dependent, whereas the domains preceding and following the procoat domain are SecYEG-dependent. It is concluded that YidC and SecYEG translocases cooperate in the membrane insertion process and that YidC functions as a foldase for native LacY but can also function as an insertase for an internal loop of the LacY chimera.

The heat-inducible T7 RNA polymerase expression vector pGP1–2 (KanR, p15A origin) was purchased from the ATCC. Transformation of pT7-5-LacY (AmpR, ColE1 origin) and pGP1–2 into the YidC depletion E. coli strain JS7131 allows expression of LacY. The construction of pLZ2-LacY, harboring both LacY with a His tag and the T7 RNA polymerase genes, is described in supplemental Fig. S1A and Methods. The LacY cassette containing the lacY gene and T7/lac tandem promoter and the T7 RNA polymerase cassette were subcloned from pT7-5-LacY and pGP1–2, respectively, into the pRSF-1b vector (KanR, RSF origin), yielding the expression vector pLZ2-LacY. Transformation of the expression vector pLZ2-LacY (KanR, RSF origin) into the SecE depletion strain CM124 allows expression of LacY.

The genes encoding the procoat (WT) and procoat (H5) domains were PCR-amplified from pMS119 PClep (WT) and pMS119 PClep (H5) and used to make the LacY-procoat chimeras pT7-5-LacY-PC (WT) and pT7-5-LacY-PC (H5). The insertion point of the M13 phage gene 8 that encodes the procoat was 3′ of the Leu-210 codon of lacY in the pT7-5-LacY vector. The YidC depletion strain JS7131 containing the pGP1–2 and pT7-5-LacY plasmids was grown at 30 °C in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% arabinose. To deplete YidC, overnight cultures of JS7131 cells were washed twice with fresh LB medium and then diluted 1:100 into LB medium with 0.2% glucose and grown for ∼5 h. The cells were then switched into M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.5% fructose and 19 amino acids, excluding methionine (Met), and grown for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. Next, the cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C for 15 min to express T7 RNA polymerase and treated with 0.2 mg/ml rifampicin and 0.4 mm IPTG for another 15 min to suppress bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting E. coli RNA polymerase activity. Cells expressing LacY were then pulse-labeled with trans-[35S]Met for 5 min at 30 °C. The Ffh depletion strain WAM121 possessing the pT7-5-LacY and pLZ-t7 vectors was cultured by growing cells in LB medium containing 0.2% arabinose at 30 °C. Overnight cultures of WAM121 were diluted 1:100 in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose or 0.2% arabinose. The cells were grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C and then switched to prewarmed M9 minimal medium. The cells were heat-shocked at 42 °C, treated with rifampicin and IPTG, and radiolabeled as described above for JS7131 cells. The SecE depletion strain CM124 bearing pLZ2-LacY was grown overnight at 30 °C in M9 medium containing 0.4% glucose and 0.2% arabinose. The overnight culture of CM124 cells was then diluted 1:100 and grown for 10–12 h at 30 °C in M9 medium containing 0.4% glucose plus 19 amino acids minus Met and supplemented with or without 0.2% arabinose. The cells were radiolabeled by using the rifampicin blocking technique as described above for YidC depletion. The signal peptidase 1 (SP1) (also known as leader peptidase) depletion strain FTL85 (47.Lüke I. Handford J.I. Palmer T. Sargent F. Proteolytic processing of Escherichia coli twin-arginine signal peptides by LepB.Arch.

The culture, grown overnight, was washed with fresh LB medium and diluted 1:100 in LB medium supplemented with 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% glucose. Cells were grown at 30 °C for 5 h and analyzed for LacY expression as described in the YidC depletion study. Where appropriate, ampicillin (100 μg/ml final concentration), kanamycin (50 μg/ml final concentration), and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml final concentration) were added to the medium. JS7131 cells containing pMS119 encoding PClep (WT) or (H5) were grown to mid-log phase under arabinose or glucose conditions. PClep was induced with 1 mm IPTG (final concentration) for 3 min before pulse-labeling for 1 min with trans-[35S]Met (0.2 mCi/ml final concentration). The radiolabeled cells were converted to spheroplasts, treated with 0.75 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h, and then incubated with 5 mm PMSF (final concentration) to quench the protease (48.Zhu L. Wasey A.

After quenching, the samples were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against leader peptidase (Lep) to precipitate PClep and against outer membrane protein A (OmpA). OmpA is digested in spheroplasts but not in intact cells and serves as a positive control for spheroplasts formation. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by phosphorimaging. The single-Cys mutants encoded by the plasmid pT7-5-LacY were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Cys-less LacY expression vector pT7-5-LacY. Unless indicated otherwise, the Cys-less LacY expression vector pKR35 encoding LacY with a Factor Xa protease site in the cytoplasmic loop between TM6 and TM7 was used for the cross-linking studies (49.Consler T.G.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The double-Cys mutants were constructed using this pKR35 vector. The radiolabeled cells expressing the LacY mutants with single Cys residues were split into four aliquots and pelleted, washed with 1 ml PBS (0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m sodium chloride (pH7.2)), and resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. Tube a was treated with 5 mm AMS (final concentration, dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide) to modify extracellular Cys residues. Tube b was treated with 20 mm NEM (final concentration) to modify intracellular and extracellular Cys residues. Tube c (negative control) and tube d (positive control) were left untreated. Tubes a and b were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were pelleted, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 25 mm Tris HCl (pH7.5). For each aliquot, crude membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h after the cells were sonified. Membrane pellets were solubilized in 30 μl of 1% dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM)/20 mm Tris HCl (pH7.4). Tubes a, b, and d were incubated with 5 mm Mal-PEG (molecular weight 5000, Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Tube c was also incubated with PEG5000 at 37 °C for 30 min as a mock treatment. All samples were mixed with 5× SDS gel loading dye, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging.

https://openalex.org/W1989941231,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) transduce the chemical signal of neurotransmitter release into membrane depolarization at excitatory synapses in the brain. The opening of the transmembrane ion channel of these ligand-gated receptors is driven by conformational transitions that are induced by the association of glutamate molecules to the ligand-binding domains (LBDs). Here, we describe the crystal structure of a GluA2 LBD tetramer in a configuration that involves an ∼30° rotation of the LBD dimers relative to the crystal structure of the full-length receptor. The configuration is stabilized by an engineered disulfide crosslink. Biochemical and electrophysiological studies on full-length receptors incorporating either this crosslink or an engineered metal bridge show that this LBD configuration corresponds to an intermediate state of receptor activation. GluA2 activation therefore involves a combination of both intra-LBD (cleft closure) and inter-LBD dimer conformational transitions. Overall, these results provide a comprehensive structural characterization of an iGluR intermediate state."

The LSD1 (also known as KDM1A) histone demethylase complex modifies chromatin and represses transcription in part by catalyzing demethylation of dimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2), a mark for active transcription. However, none of its currently known subunits recognizes methylated histones. The Snai1 family transcription factors are central drivers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by which epithelial cells acquire enhanced invasiveness. Snai1-mediated transcriptional repression of epithelial genes depends on its recruitment of the LSD1 complex and ensuing demethylation of H3K4me2 at its target genes. Through biochemical purification, we identified the MBT domain-containing protein SFMBT1 as a novel component of the LSD1 complex associated with Snai1.

https://openalex.org/W2087913509,"There is increasing evidence that the phase of ongoing oscillations plays a role in neural coding, but its relative importance throughout the brain has yet to be understood. We assessed single-trial phase coding in four temporal lobe and four frontal lobe regions of the human brain using local field potentials (LFPs) recorded during a card-matching task. In the temporal lobe, classification of correct/incorrect matches based on LFP phase was significantly better than classification based on amplitude and comparable to the full LFP signal. Surprisingly, in these regions, the correct/incorrect mean phases became aligned to one another before they diverged and coded for trial outcome. Neural responses in the amygdala were consistent with a mechanism of phase resetting, while parahippocampal gyrus activity was indicative of evoked potentials. These findings highlight the importance of phase coding in human medial temporal lobe and suggest that different brain regions may represent information in diverse ways."
https://openalex.org/W2137103342,"Nutrients are essential for living organisms because they fuel biological processes in cells. Cells monitor nutrient abundance and coordinate a ratio of anabolic and catabolic reactions. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is the essential nutrient-sensing pathway that controls anabolic processes in cells. The central component of this pathway is mTOR, a highly conserved and essential protein kinase that exists in two distinct functional complexes. The nutrient-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) controls cell growth and cell size by phosphorylation of the regulators of protein synthesis S6K1 and 4EBP1, whereas its second complex, mTORC2, regulates cell proliferation by functioning as the regulatory kinase of Akt and other members of the AGC kinase family. The regulation of mTORC2 remains poorly characterized. Our study shows that the cellular ATP balance controls a basal kinase activity of mTORC2 that maintains the integrity of mTORC2 and phosphorylation of Akt on the turn motif Thr-450 site. We found that mTOR stabilizes SIN1 by phosphorylation of its hydrophobic and conserved Ser-260 site to maintain the integrity of mTORC2. The optimal kinase activity of mTORC2 requires a concentration of ATP above 1.2 mM and makes this kinase complex highly sensitive to ATP depletion. We found that not amino acid but glucose deprivation of cells or acute ATP depletion prevented the mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of SIN1 on Ser-260 and Akt on Thr-450. In a low glucose medium, the cells carrying a substitution of SIN1 with its phosphomimetic mutant show an increased rate of cell proliferation related to a higher abundance of mTORC2 and phosphorylation of Akt. Thus, the homeostatic ATP sensor mTOR controls the integrity of mTORC2 and phosphorylation of Akt on the turn motif site."

https://openalex.org/W2008722340,"Transferrin internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and subsequent recycling after iron delivery has been extensively studied. Here we demonstrate a previously unrecognized parameter regulating this recycling, the binding of galectin-3 to particular glycoforms of transferrin. Two fractions of transferrin, separated by affinity chromatography based on their binding or not to galectin-3, are targeted to kinetically different endocytic pathways in HFL-1 cells expressing galectin-3 but not in SKBR3 cells lacking galectin-3; the SKBR3 cells, however, can acquire the ability to target these transferrin glycoforms differently after preloading with exogenously added galectin-3. In all, this study provides the first evidence of a functional role for transferrin glycans, in intracellular trafficking after uptake.

These are novel aspects of transferrin cell biology, which has previously considered only a degree of iron loading, but not other forms of heterogeneity.Background: Transferrin has two N-glycans but their biological function remains unknown.Results: About 5% of human serotransferrin glycoforms bind galectin-3 and are targeted to a different endocytic pathway.Conclusion: Transferrin glycosylation may mediate a previously unrecognized level of physiological regulation.Significance: This is the first evidence that different molecular forms of transferrin, besides iron loading, may have different cellular function. Transferrin internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and subsequent recycling after iron delivery has been extensively studied. Here we demonstrate a previously unrecognized parameter regulating this recycling, the binding of galectin-3 to particular glycoforms of transferrin. Two fractions of transferrin, separated by affinity chromatography based on their binding or not to galectin-3, are targeted to kinetically different endocytic pathways in HFL-1 cells expressing galectin-3 but not in SKBR3 cells lacking galectin-3; the SKBR3 cells, however, can acquire the ability to target these transferrin glycoforms differently after preloading with exogenously added galectin-3. In all, this study provides the first evidence of a functional role for transferrin glycans, in intracellular trafficking after uptake. Moreover, the galectin-3-bound glycoform increased in cancer, suggesting a pathophysiological regulation. These are novel aspects of transferrin cell biology, which has previously considered only a degree of iron loading, but not other forms of heterogeneity.

Upf factors promoted the degradation of the human von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, which is an unfolded protein in yeast cells, in a manner that depends on the presence of a faux 3′-UTR.

https://openalex.org/W2059312712,"Group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) strain AP53 is a primary isolate from a patient with necrotizing fasciitis. These AP53 cells contain an inactivating mutation in the sensor component of the cluster of virulence (cov) responder (R)/sensor (S) two-component gene regulatory system (covRS), which enhances the virulence of the primary strain, AP53/covR(+)S(-). However, specific mechanisms by which the covRS system regulates the survival of GAS in humans are incomplete. Here, we show a key role for covRS in the regulation of opsonophagocytosis of AP53 by human neutrophils. AP53/covR(+)S(-) cells displayed potent binding of host complement inhibitors of C3 convertase, viz. Factor H (FH) and C4-binding protein (C4BP), which concomitantly led to minimal C3b deposition on AP53 cells, further showing that these plasma protein inhibitors are active on GAS cells. This resulted in weak killing of the bacteria by human neutrophils and a corresponding high death rate of mice after injection of these cells. After targeted allelic alteration of covS(-) to wild-type covS (covS(+)), a dramatic loss of FH and C4BP binding to the AP53/covR(+)S(+) cells was observed. This resulted in elevated C3b deposition on AP53/covR(+)S(+) cells, a high level of opsonophagocytosis by human neutrophils, and a very low death rate of mice infected with AP53/covR(+)S(+). We show that covRS is a critical transcriptional regulator of genes directing AP53 killing by neutrophils and regulates the levels of the receptors for FH and C4BP, which we identify as the products of the fba and enn genes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2117585354,"Increased processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in the brain is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the identification of molecules that regulate Aβ generation is crucial for future therapeutic approaches for AD. We demonstrated previously that RanBP9 regulates Aβ generation in a number of cell lines and primary neuronal cultures by forming tripartite protein complexes with APP, low-density lipoprotein-related protein, and BACE1, consequently leading to increased amyloid plaque burden in the brain. RanBP9 is a scaffold protein that exists and functions in multiprotein complexes. To identify other proteins that may bind RanBP9 and regulate Aβ levels, we used a two-hybrid analysis against a human brain cDNA library and identified COPS5 as a novel RanBP9-interacting protein. This interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and mouse brain. Colocalization of COPS5 and RanBP9 in the same subcellular compartments further supported the interaction of both proteins. Furthermore, like RanBP9, COPS5 robustly increased Aβ generation, followed by increased soluble APP-β (sAPP-β) and decreased soluble-APP-α (sAPP-α) levels. Most importantly, down-regulation of COPS5 by siRNAs reduced Aβ generation, implying that endogenous COPS5 regulates Aβ generation. Finally, COPS5 levels were increased significantly in AD brains and APΔE9 transgenic mice, and overexpression of COPS5 strongly increased RanBP9 protein levels by increasing its half-life. Taken together, these results suggest that COPS5 increases Aβ generation by increasing RanBP9 levels. Thus, COPS5 is a novel RanBP9-binding protein that increases APP processing and Aβ generation by stabilizing RanBP9 protein levels.Background: Increased generation of toxic amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in the brain is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).Results: COPS5 (Jab1) is a novel RanBP9-interacting protein that robustly increases Aβ generationConclusion: COPS5 increases Aβ generation by stabilizing RanBP9 protein levels.Significance: Lowering COPS5 levels may be an effective therapeutic approach for AD.

It is now estimated that nearly 35.6 million patients are affected by AD worldwide and that about 4.6 million new cases are added each year, causing an enormous societal and economic burden (1Wimo A. Winblad B. Jonsson L. The worldwide societal costs of dementia. Estimates for 2009.Alzheimer's Dement. 2010; 6: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Accumulation of amyloid plaques made up of amyloid β peptide (Aβ), derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the action of β and γ-secretases is a major hallmark of AD. Converging genetic, biochemical, and pathological evidence strongly indicates that Aβ plays an early and crucial role in AD pathogenesis (2Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease. Progress and problems on the road to therapeutics.Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10962) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was discovered recently that the A673T coding mutation in APP protects significantly against memory decline in patients with AD as well as in the normally aging population by decreasing Aβ levels (3Jonsson T. Atwal J.K. Steinberg S. Snaedal J. Jonsson P.V. Bjornsson S. Stefansson H. Sulem P. Gudbjartsson D. Maloney J. Hoyte K. Gustafson A. Liu Y. Lu Y. Bhangale T. Graham R.R. Huttenlocher J.

A mutation in APP protects against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline.Nature. 2012; 488: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). These findings provided a significant boost to the role of APP metabolism as a cause of not only familial but also sporadic cases of AD. AD is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease that has been suggested to have a strong genetic basis with heritability estimates of up to 80% (4Gatz M. Reynolds C.A. Fratiglioni L. Johansson B. Mortimer J.A. Berg S. Fiske A. Pedersen N.L. Role of genes and environments for explaining Alzheimer's disease.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2006; 63: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Twin and family studies have confirmed that genetic factors are estimated to play a crucial role in at least 80% of AD cases (5Tanzi R.E. A brief history of Alzheimer's disease gene discovery.J. Alzheimer's Dis. 2013; 33: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, genetic variants in the four well established genes, namely APP, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and ApoE, account for less than 1% of AD cases (6Bird T.D. Genetic aspects of Alzheimer's disease.Genet. Med. 2008; 10: 231-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). If we combine these well established genes with the newly identified nine genetic risk factors from the genome-wide association studies for late-onset AD, they together account for only less than half of this heritability (7Kamboh M.I. Demirci F.Y. Wang X. Minster R.L. Carrasquillo M.M. Pankratz V.S. Younkin S.G. Saykin A.J. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Jun G. Baldwin C. Logue M.W. Buros J. Farrer L.

Psychiatry. 2012; 2: e117Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, additional risk genes need to be identified. The recent failure of secretase inhibitors at the clinical trials because of unacceptable levels of toxicity also indicates the need for the identification of all proteins that regulate or modulate Aβ generation so that they may be targeted for novel designs in future therapeutic approaches. RanBP9 is a scaffolding protein implicated in a variety of functions through integration of cell surface receptors with intracellular signaling targets (8Suresh B. Ramakrishna S. Baek K.H. Diverse roles of the scaffolding protein RanBPM.Drug Discov. Today. 2012; 17: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, RanBP9 was found to be within the clusters of RNA transcript pairs associated with markers of AD progression, suggesting that RanBP9 might contribute to the pathogenesis of AD (9Arefin A.S. Mathieson L. Johnstone D. Berretta R. Moscato P. Unveiling clusters of RNA transcript pairs associated with markers of Alzheimer's disease progression.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e45535Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In fact, even before this finding, we showed for the first time that RanBP9 protein levels are increased 6-fold in AD brains (10Lakshmana M.K. Chung J.Y. Wickramarachchi S. Tak E. Bianchi E. Koo E.H. Kang D.E. A fragment of the scaffolding protein RanBP9 is increased in Alzheimer's disease brains and strongly potentiates amyloid-β peptide generation.FASEB J. 2010; 24: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that RanBP9 overexpression increases Aβ generation 4-fold in cell cultures by increasing β-secretase-mediated processing of APP (11Lakshmana M.K. Yoon I.S. Chen E. Bianchi E. Koo E.H. Kang D.E. Novel role of RanBP9 in BACE1 processing of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid β peptide generation.J. Biol.

Reddy K.M. Koo E.H. Kang D.E. Role of RanBP9 on amyloidogenic processing of APP and synaptic protein levels in the mouse brain.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 2072-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which, in turn, leads to a significant loss of synaptic proteins (12Lakshmana M.K. Hayes C.D. Bennett S.P. Bianchi E. Reddy K.M. Koo E.H. Kang D.E. Role of RanBP9 on amyloidogenic processing of APP and synaptic protein levels in the mouse brain.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 2072-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because RanBP9 is known to exist in large multiprotein complexes of greater than 670 kDa (13Nishitani H. Hirose E. Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Umeda M. Nishii K. Mori N. Nishimoto T. Full-sized RanBPM cDNA encodes a protein processing a long stretch of proline and glutamine within the N-terminal region, comprising a large protein complex.Gene. 2001; 272: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Zou Y. Lim S. Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Serine/threonine kinase Mirk/Dyrk1B is an inhibitor of epithelial cell migration and is negatively regulated by the Met adaptor Ran-binding protein M.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49573-49581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we speculated that Aβ generation may be modulated by several other RanBP9-binding proteins. Therefore, we used RanBP9 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified COP9 constitutive photomorphogenic homolog subunit 5 (COPS5) as a bona fide binding partner of RanBP9. We confirmed COPS5 binding to RanBP9 under overexpression conditions using tagged antibodies and also binding of endogenous proteins in HEK293 and NT2 cells as well as mouse brains. We also show here that COPS5 increases Aβ generation by stabilizing RanBP9 protein levels. To subclone the bait constructs for the RanBP9-LisH and RanBP9-SPRY domains, PCR-amplified cDNA encoding the human RanBP9-LisH region (amino acids 365–397) and RanBP9-SPRY region (amino acids 213–365) were amplified using PcDNA3-FLAG-RanBP9 as a template. The amplified DNA was ligated into the NcoI-SalI restriction sites of the pGBKT7 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), resulting in the pGBKT7-LisH and pGBKT7-SPRY constructs. These bait cDNAs were cloned in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The CTLH domain of RanBP9 was also cloned into the pGBKT7 vector in the same NcoI-SalI restriction sites. FLAG-HA-COPS5 was a gift from Dr. Wade Harper (Addgene plasmid no. 22541). GFP-RanBP9-FL construct was received from Dr. Hideo Nishitani, Kyushu University, Japan. The Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3 GFP-RanBP9 deletion constructs were prepared by a combination of PCR amplification and restriction digestions. All of these cDNA constructs were sequence-verified, and protein expression was confirmed prior to use. The minimal selective dropout (SD) base, minimal SD agar base, and dropout-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp supplement were all purchased from BD Biosciences. X-α-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-a-d-galactopyranoside) was from Research Products International (Mt. Prospect, IL). Kanamycin solution was from Teknova (Hollister, CA). Ampicillin, adenine, leucine, tryptophan, histidine, salmon sperm double-stranded DNA (single-stranded DNA), and protease inhibitor mix for use in mammalian cells were from Sigma-Aldrich. The anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads and anti-rabbit IgG-agarose beads were from American Qualex International (San Clemente, CA). The polyclonal antibodies CT15 (against the C-terminal 15 residues of APP) and 63d (against the APP ectodomain) have been described previously (11Lakshmana M.K. Yoon I.S. Chen E. Bianchi E. Koo E.H.

The monoclonal antibody Ab9 used for immunoprecipitation of Aβ was purified from supernatants of the hybridoma generated in mice by Biomatik Corp. (Ontario, Canada). The monoclonal antibody 6E10 (catalog no. SIG-39300, recognizing 1–17 of the Aβ sequence) was obtained from Covance Research (Denver, CO). Polyclonal anti-sAPPβ-WT antibody (catalog no. 18957) was purchased from IBL Co. Ltd (Gunma, Japan). Monoclonal antibody against RanBP9 was produced by immunizing mice with a peptide corresponding to the 146–729 amino acids of RanBP9 as described previously (11Lakshmana M.K. Yoon I.S. Chen E. Bianchi E. Koo E.H. Kang D.E. Novel role of RanBP9 in BACE1 processing of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid β peptide generation.J. Biol.

(University of California Davis, National Institutes of Health NeuroMab, Davis, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin (catalog no. A00702) was purchased from Genscript USA Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). All secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). All antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) buffer. The expression of the pGBKT7-LisH and pGBKT7-SPRY constructs was confirmed for protein expression by immunoblotting. Initially the constructs were tested for self-activation of the His3 reporter gene in the absence of the prey plasmid by plating transformed yeast on selective dropout plates lacking leucine and tryptophan. This was to rule out the possibility that the bait cDNA itself, in the absence of an interacting protein, might act as a transcriptional activator of the His gene. We used a high-stringency protocol to screen the library from human brain fused with the Gal4 transactivation domain constructed in the PGADT7-T plasmid (Clontech). The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed in the AH109 yeast strain, which contains three reporters (ADE2, HIS2, and MEL1). The bait plasmid was initially transformed into AH109, and growth was selected in SD dropout plates lacking tryptophan as described previously (15Lakshmana M.K. Chen E. Yoon I.-S. Kang D.E. C-terminal 37 residues of LRP promote the amyloidogenic processing of APP independent of FE65.J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These yeast strains expressing the RanBP9-LisH or RanBP9-SPRY domains were then used individually for mating with the Tyr-187 mating strain transformed with a cDNA library made from human brain and plated them on SD dropout plates lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. Yeast was allowed to grow for 72 h at 30 °C before His+ cells were scored and an X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) overlay assay was performed. Colonies that grew under histidine (His+) were then tested for galactosidase expression. Colonies that were positive for both His+ and β-galactosidase (LacZ) were selected as first-round positives. The interactions were then verified by recovering prey plasmids from positive colonies, transforming them into yeast strains expressing the RanBP9-LisH or RanBP9-SPRY domains as bait and reconfirming the HIS+ and LacZ+ phenotype. The plasmid DNAs from the yeast were shuttled to bacteria by standard methods and subjected to endonuclease restriction digest analysis to sort out both different and identical cDNA library plasmids. Different sizes of cDNA prey inserts from yeast that grew under selection were sequenced. The identities of the prey inserts were determined by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool comparison against the National Center for Biotechnology database. HEK293FT and human neuron-committed teratocarcinoma (NT2) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For coimmunoprecipitations and APP metabolism studies, transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of empty vectors were included to keep the overall DNA quantity constant for all experimental groups. Coimmunoprecipitations were carried out exactly as described previously (11Lakshmana M.K. Yoon I.S. Chen E. Bianchi E. Koo E.H. Kang D.E.

Chem. 2009; 284: 11863-11872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after the transfection, conditioned media were collected for the detection of Aβ and sAPPs, and the lysates were used for the detection of C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and APP holoprotein. After 48 h of transient transfections, the conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and immunoprecipitated overnight using a monoclonal Ab9 antibody (recognizing the 1–16 amino acids of Aβ) to pull down total Aβ. After SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using NuPAGE 4–12% bis-tris gels, total Aβ was detected by immunoblotting using a mixture of 6E10/82E1 antibodies, which reliably detect total Aβ as described previously (10Lakshmana M.K.

The conditioned medium was also immunoblotted to detect sAPPα (6E10), sAPPβ (anti-sAPPβ-WT, and rabbit IgG; IBL America Ltd.) and sAPPtotal (63G) using the indicated antibodies. To detect APP holoprotein and CTFs, the cells were lysed using lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40) with complete protease inhibitor mix (Sigma), and equal amounts of proteins were loaded in to each well and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Following transfer onto PVDF membranes, they were blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T and incubated overnight with primary antibodies, followed by 1–4 h of incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, such as monoclonal goat anti-mouse IgG light chain or polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG light chain. The protein signals were detected using Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Quantitation of Western blot signals was done using Java-based ImageJ software available freely from the National Institutes of Health. We also used ELISA for detection of Aβ levels because of a significant reduction of COPS5 siRNAs that exceeded the detection limit of immunoblot analyses for Aβ. A 19-nucleotide siRNA duplex targeting COPS5 or RanBP9 and scrambled control siRNA were synthesized and supplied in a 2′-deprotected, annealed, and desalted format from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The siRNAs were transiently transfected into neuro-2A (N2A) cells stably expressing the APP695swe mutation at 50–100 nm final concentrations using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. After 24 h of the first transfection, a second transfection was performed to enhance the knockdown effect of the siRNAs. Twenty-four hours after the second transfection, conditioned media were collected and centrifuged to remove the debris. Aβ was detected by sandwich ELISA exactly as described previously by our laboratory (11Lakshmana M.K. Yoon I.S. Chen E. Bianchi E. Koo E.H. Kang D.E.

Immunoblot signals for Aβ, CTFs, sAPPs, APP holoprotein, COPS5, RanBP9, and actin were quantified using ImageJ software. Statistical significance was established by either Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by post hoc test using Instat3 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). We used a two-tailed p value, assuming that populations may have different standard errors. The data presented are mean ± S.E. The data were considered significant only if p < 0.05 (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001).

Unveiling clusters of RNA transcript pairs associated with markers of Alzheimer's disease progression.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e45535Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In fact, down-regulation of RanBP9 significantly reduced Aβ generation in primary neuronal cultures (11Lakshmana M.K. Yoon I.S. Chen E. Bianchi E. Koo E.H. Kang D.E. Novel role of RanBP9 in BACE1 processing of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid β peptide generation.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11863-11872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), implying that RanBP9 regulates Aβ generation. This novel finding led us to strongly believe that RanBP9 and RanBP9-binding proteins are excellent therapeutic targets for AD. Therefore, to identify novel RanBP9 functional modulators, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library using the human RanBP9-LisH domain as well as the RanBP9-SPRY domain as bait. We used a stringent protocol (quadruple dropout plates) to reduce the number of false positives. Of more than 1 million clones screened, we identified several colonies that repeatedly tested positive by turning blue and growing on the quadruple dropout plates. Among them, we were particularly interested in a clone that turned out to contain the partial cDNA for the COP9 constitutive photomorphogenic homolog subunit 5 (COPS5, also called Jab1). Thus, yeast colonies that turned blue only when COPS5 was cotransformed with the RanBP9-LisH domain, but not when cotransformed with RanBP9-CTLH domain or when transformed with pGB-empty vector alone or with pGB-lamin used as a negative control, suggested a positive interaction between COPS5 and the RanBP9-LisH domain (Fig. 1A). The interaction between RanBP9-LisH and COPS5 was confirmed by quantitatively assaying for β-galactosidase activity using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Fig. 1B shows that the β-gal activity of RanBP9-LisH and COPS5 was 240 units (p < 0.001), almost comparable with the levels of 357 units (p < 0.001) for p53-T7, widely used as positive controls for Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid screens. The negative control, lamin, was only 37 units. Thus, RanBP9 binds COPS5 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Next we used coimmunoprecipitation to confirm that the interaction occurs in a mammalian system. HEK293FT cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding FLAG- and HA-tagged COPS5 and GFP-tagged RanBP9. 150 μg of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies. The immunoprecipitated complexes specifically contained FLAG-COPS5, which was detected by an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A). In the GFP-antibody minus controls, which contained only mouse IgG-agarose beads, FLAG-COPS5 was not detected. GFP-RanBP9 detected by GFP antibody is also shown. We further confirmed these interactions in the reciprocal coimmunoprecipitations, as shown in Fig. 2A (lower panel). Input (Inp) lysates corresponding to 150 μg of total proteins were loaded for comparison. Endogenous RanBP9 and COPS5 protein interactions were also confirmed in both HEK293 cells and mouse brain lysates. The 1% Nonidet P-40 lysates from HEK293 cells or mouse brains were ultracentrifuged, and the total proteins were quantified in the supernatants by the BCA method. Overnight incubation of equal amounts of protein lysates with polyclonal COPS5 antibody but not with control IgG beads specifically pulled down RanBP9 protein in HEK293 cells as well as mouse brains (Fig. 2B). These results confirmed that not only the exogenous proteins but also endogenous RanBP9 and COPS5 interact with each other. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation with COPS5 antibody also pulled down APP (CT15), LRP-β chain (1704), and BACE1 (anti-BACE1) in HEK cells, suggesting that, like RanBP9, COPS5 also interacts directly with these proteins (Fig. 2B). COPS5 protein pulled down after immunoprecipitations with anti-COPS5 antibody is shown for both HEK cells and mouse brains (Fig. 2B). To map the domains within RanBP9 that bind to COPS5, we prepared different deletion mutants of RanBP9 as fusion proteins to GFP. These mutants were transiently cotransfected with FLAG-COPS5 in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated overnight with an anti-GFP antibody. The left panel of Fig. 2C shows the expression of proteins for the RanBP9-GFP deletion mutants. COPS5 was pulled down only when RanBP9 FL or the Δ2 or Δ3 mutants were cotransfected but not when Δ1 was cotransfected (Fig. 2C, right panel). This suggests that only the full-length or the LisH-SPRY domains of RanBP9, but not the CTLH and CRA domains, bind to COPS5. We demonstrated previously that the RanBP9 protein is present throughout the cytoplasm, including the complex neurite networks in the primary neuronal cultures and in the dendritic arbor in the adult mouse brain (12Lakshmana M.K. Hayes C.D. Bennett S.P. Bianchi E. Reddy K.M. Koo E.H. Kang D.E.

Also, in our previous study, when COPS5 was transiently expressed in COS cells, COPS5 was found to be diffusely distributed throughout the cell (16Bianchi E. Denti S. Granata A. Bossi G. Geginat J.

In this study, we address changes in the intramolecular dynamics coupling within the c-Abl regulatory unit by presenting its N-terminal segment (N-Cap) with an alternative function in the cell as c-Abl becomes activated. Using small angle x-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that the N-Cap and the Src homology (SH) 3 domain acquire μs-ms motions upon N-Cap association with the SH2-L domain, revealing a stabilizing synergy between these segments. The N-Cap-myristoyl tether likely triggers the protein to anchor to the membrane because of these flip-flop dynamics, which occur in the μs-ms time range. This segment not only presents the myristate during c-Abl inhibition but may also trigger protein localization inside the cell in a functional and stability-dependent mechanism that is lost in Bcr-Abl(+) cells, which underlie chronic myeloid leukemia. This loss of intramolecular dynamics and binding to the cellular membrane is a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2059957849,"BLT2, a low affinity receptor for leukotriene B4 (LTB4), is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and is involved in many signal transduction pathways associated with various cellular phenotypes, including chemotactic motility. However, the regulatory mechanism for BLT2 has not yet been demonstrated. To understand the regulatory mechanism of BLT2, we screened and identified the proteins that bind to BLT2. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay with the BLT2 C-terminal domain as bait, we found that RanBPM, a previously proposed scaffold protein, interacts with BLT2. We demonstrated the specific interaction between BLT2 and RanBPM by GST pulldown assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay. To elucidate the biological function of the RanBPM-BLT2 interaction, we evaluated the effects of RanBPM overexpression or knockdown. We found that BLT2-mediated motility was severely attenuated by RanBPM overexpression and that knockdown of endogenous RanBPM by shRNA strongly promoted BLT2-mediated motility, suggesting a negative regulatory function of RanBPM toward BLT2. Furthermore, we observed that the addition of BLT2 ligands caused the dissociation of BLT2 and RanBPM, thus releasing the negative regulatory effect of RanBPM. Finally, we propose that Akt-induced BLT2 phosphorylation at residue Thr(355), which occurs after the addition of BLT2 ligands, is a potential mechanism by which BLT2 dissociates from RanBPM, resulting in stimulation of BLT2 signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that RanBPM acts as a negative regulator of BLT2 signaling to attenuate BLT2-mediated cell motility."

https://openalex.org/W2142951552,"The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an essential protein required for the activity and stability of multiple proteins termed clients. Hsp90 cooperates with a set of co-chaperone proteins that modulate Hsp90 activity and/or target clients to Hsp90 for folding. Many of the Hsp90 co-chaperones, including Cpr6 and Cpr7, contain tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains that bind a common acceptor site at the carboxyl terminus of Hsp90. We found that Cpr6 and Hsp90 interacted with Ura2, a protein critical for pyrimidine biosynthesis. Mutation or inhibition of Hsp90 resulted in decreased accumulation of Ura2, indicating it is an Hsp90 client. Cpr6 interacted with Ura2 in the absence of stable Cpr6-Hsp90 interaction, suggesting a direct interaction. However, loss of Cpr6 did not alter the Ura2-Hsp90 interaction or Ura2 accumulation. The TPR domain of Cpr6 was required for Ura2 interaction, but other TPR containing co-chaperones, including Cpr7, failed to interact with Ura2 or rescue CPR6-dependent growth defects. Further analysis suggests that the carboxyl-terminal 100 amino acids of Cpr6 and Cpr7 are critical for specifying their unique functions, providing new information about this important class of Hsp90 co-chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W2052311312,"tRNase Z is an essential endonuclease responsible for tRNA 3′-end maturation. tRNase Z exists in a short form (tRNase ZS) and a long form (tRNase ZL).

Most eukaryotes characterized thus far, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and humans, contain only one tRNase ZL gene encoding both nuclear and mitochondrial forms of tRNase ZL.

Conclusion: The evolution of two tRNase Z genes and their differential expression in fission yeast may avoid toxic off-target effects. Significance: The results advance our understanding of tRNA 3′-end maturation. Almost all RNA molecules are synthesized as precursors that must undergo processing and modifications to form functional RNAs (1Licatalosi D.D. Darnell R.B. RNA processing and its regulation: global insights into biological networks.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). tRNA processing and modification steps include removal of 5′- and 3′-extensions, splicing of introns (for only a subset of nuclear pre-tRNAs), base modifications, and addition of 3′-CCA sequence (2Maraia R.J.

Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1819: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For most nuclear pre-tRNAs, 5′-end processing occurs prior to 3′-end processing, and binding by the conserved La protein to pre-tRNAs is required for the orderly processing of tRNA and for the endonucleolytic processing of pre-tRNA 3′-ends (5Huang Y.

In contrast, the La protein is not involved in mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) 2The abbreviations used are: mt-tRNA, mitochondrial tRNA; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; nt, nucleotide(s); YES, yeast extract supplement. processing, and the order of mitochondrial pre-tRNA end processing can vary (9Hopper A.K. Phizicky E.M. tRNA transfers to the limelight.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 162-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Additionally, unlike nuclear tRNAs, mt-tRNAs are polycistronic. Moreover, mt-tRNAs normally deviate from the classic tRNA cloverleaf secondary structure and L-shaped tertiary structure due to high sequence and size variation in the D- and T-loops. The metazoan mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is typically a compact circular molecule (∼16 kb). Transcription of metazoan mtDNA is initiated at a single unidirectional or bidirectional promoter on each strand, and mt-tRNAs are produced from large polycistronic RNAs (for reviews, see Refs. 10Asin-Cayuela J.

In contrast, the mtDNA of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is large (∼75–85 kb in size) and has numerous promoters (>20) that direct different levels of transcription (12Biswas T.K.

Regulation of mitochondrial gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 152: 145-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the mtDNA is compact (∼19 kb in size) and contains three promoters (15Jiang H. Sun W. Wang Z. Zhang J. Chen D. Murchie A.I.

Hansen M. Lang B.F. Transcription and RNA-processing in fission yeast mitochondria.RNA. 2005; 11: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A simple model known as the tRNA punctuation model has been proposed for animal mtRNA processing (17Ojala D. Montoya J. Attardi G. tRNA punctuation model of RNA processing in human mitochondria.Nature. 1981; 290: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 18Tzagoloff A. Myers A.M. Genetics of mitochondrial biogenesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 249-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). According to this model, the secondary structures of tRNAs serve as mtRNA-processing signals. Processing of mt-tRNA liberates not only tRNA but also flanking RNAs from the precursor RNA. Thus, tRNA plays an important role in animal mitochondrial mRNA and rRNA processing. In contrast, mtRNA processing in S. cerevisiae is a complex process (19Schäfer B. RNA maturation in mitochondria of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.Gene. 2005; 354: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After tRNA processing, which liberates the 5′- and 3′-ends of pre-mRNAs and pre-rRNAs, additional processing steps are required for the generation of mature mRNAs and rRNAs in S. cerevisiae (20Fekete Z. Ellis T.P. Schonauer M.S. Dieckmann C.L. Pet127 governs a 5′ → 3′-exonuclease important in maturation of apocytochrome b mRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3767-3772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that mtRNA processing is more similar between S. pombe and humans than between either and S. cerevisiae (19Schäfer B. RNA maturation in mitochondria of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.Gene. 2005; 354: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the mitochondrial genome of S. pombe, the 3′-ends of tRNAs are matched to the 5′-ends of most other RNA species (16Schäfer B. Hansen M. Lang B.F. Transcription and RNA-processing in fission yeast mitochondria.RNA. 2005; 11: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Schäfer B. RNA maturation in mitochondria of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.Gene. 2005; 354: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This suggests that the mt-tRNA 3′-end-processing enzyme not only is responsible for tRNA 3′-end maturation but also plays a critical role in the generation of the 5′-ends of other mtRNA species in S. pombe. Unlike 5′-end maturation, the generation of the 3′-ends of mRNAs involves additional endonucleolytic cleavage (19Schäfer B. RNA maturation in mitochondria of S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.Gene. 2005; 354: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The endonuclease tRNase Z (also called RNase Z or 3′-tRNase) is near-ubiquitous in all three domains of life and is believed to be responsible for the removal of a 3′-extension of CCA-less tRNA precursors, which is an essential step for the generation of mature CCA termini at the tRNA 3′-end (for reviews, see Refs. 21Ceballos M. Vioque A. tRNase Z.Protein Pept. Lett. 2007; 14: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Hartmann R.K. Gössringer M. Späth B. Fischer S. Marchfelder A.

Marchfelder A. tRNase Z: the end is not in sight.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2404-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). tRNase Zs belong to the β-CAPS (metallo-β-lactamase-associated CISF/Artemis/SNM1/PSO2) subfamily of the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily with diverse functions (25Dominski Z. Nucleases of the metallo-β-lactamase family and their role in DNA and RNA metabolism.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 42: 67-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Members of the β-CAPS subfamily are various nucleic acid-processing and -degrading enzymes, including cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors CPSF73 and CPSF100, which are required for the 3′-end formation of mRNA, and RNase J, which is involved in the 5′-end maturation of rRNAs and mRNA stability in bacteria. tRNase Z can be classified into a short form (tRNase ZS) and a long form (tRNase ZL). Sequence analysis suggests that tRNase ZL, which is about twice the size of the short form, arises from gene duplication of tRNase ZS (26Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Teng D.H. Abtin V. Baumgard M.

Most eukaryotes examined thus far, including S. cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster, contain only one tRNase ZL, which is either demonstrated or predicted to be localized in both the nucleus and mitochondria. In contrast, humans contain one tRNase ZL gene (also called ELAC2) and one tRNase ZS gene (also called ELAC1). The human tRNase ZL gene was originally identified as a candidate prostate cancer susceptibility gene by linkage analysis and positional cloning. However, it remains unknown how variations in the human tRNase ZL gene contribute to increased risk of prostate cancer. Human tRNase ZL is localized in both the nucleus and mitochondria (30Brzezniak L.K. Bijata M. Szczesny R.J. Stepien P.P.

Takaku H. Nashimoto M. Regulation of the human tRNase ZS gene expression.FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2532-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In plants, the situation is more complex. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana has two tRNase ZLs and two tRNase ZSs. The two long forms of tRNase Z are found in both the nucleus and mitochondria and in the mitochondria, respectively, whereas the two short forms are present in the cytoplasm and chloroplasts, respectively (34Canino G.

Although different eukaryotic organisms can have different numbers and forms of tRNase Z with different subcellular localizations, it has been suggested that a single tRNase ZL is responsible for the 3′-end processing of both nuclear and mitochondrial pre-tRNAs (27Zhao W. Yu H. Li S. Huang Y. Identification and analysis of candidate fungal tRNA 3′-end processing endonucleases tRNase Zs, homologs of the putative prostate cancer susceptibility protein ELAC2.BMC Evol.

In support of this hypothesis, it has recently been found that Drosophila tRNase ZL is involved in both nuclear and mitochondrial pre-tRNA 3′-end processing (36Xie X. Dubrovskaya V.A. Dubrovsky E.B.

Biol. 2011; 41: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, a role for ELAC2 in mitochondrial pre-tRNA 3′-end processing has recently been demonstrated in vivo (30Brzezniak L.K. Bijata M. Szczesny R.J. Stepien P.P.

Although tRNase ZLs from some species, including S. cerevisiae (37Takaku H. Minagawa A. Takagi M. Nashimoto M. The N-terminal half-domain of the long form of tRNase Z is required for the RNase 65 activity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), S. pombe (38Gan X. Yang J. Li J. Yu H. Dai H. Liu J. Huang Y. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has two distinct tRNase ZLs encoded by two different genes and differentially targeted to the nucleus and mitochondria.Biochem. J. 2011; 435: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and A. thaliana (34Canino G. Bocian E. Barbezier N. Echeverria M. Forner J. Binder S. Marchfelder A. Arabidopsis encodes four tRNase Z enzymes.Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 1491-1502Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), have been shown to possess tRNA 3′-end processing activity in vitro, their nuclear and mitochondrial tRNA 3′-end processing activity in vivo remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Unlike most eukaryotes, each of all four sequenced Schizosaccharomyces species (S. pombe, Schizosaccharomyces octosporus, Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, and Schizosaccharomyces cryophilus) contains two candidate tRNase ZLs encoded by two different essential genes (27Zhao W. Yu H. Li S. Huang Y. Identification and analysis of candidate fungal tRNA 3′-end processing endonucleases tRNase Zs, homologs of the putative prostate cancer susceptibility protein ELAC2.BMC Evol. Biol. 2010; 10: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The two proteins from each species share weak sequence similarity. We have previously demonstrated that the two S. pombe tRNase ZLs (Trz1 and Trz2) are localized to the nucleus and mitochondria, respectively, and can endonucleolytically remove the 3′-extension from a human nuclear pre-tRNA in vitro (38Gan X. Yang J. Li J. Yu H. Dai H. Liu J. Huang Y. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has two distinct tRNase ZLs encoded by two different genes and differentially targeted to the nucleus and mitochondria.Biochem. J. 2011; 435: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, compelling in vivo evidence that the nuclear and mitochondrial tRNase Z activities are separated into two distinct proteins in S. pombe is still lacking. In this work, we analyzed the processing of tRNAs in two strains carrying the temperature-sensitive mutant allele of trz1 (trz1-1) or trz2 (trz2-1). We demonstrate that Trz1 and Trz2 are responsible for 3′-end processing of nuclear and mitochondrial pre-tRNAs, respectively. We also show that Trz2 plays a crucial role in 5′-end maturation of other types of RNAs in mitochondria. The S. pombe strains used in this study were YHL6381 (wild-type; h+ leu1-32 his3-D1 ura4-D18 ade6-210), YAS56 (wild-type; h+ leu1-32 ura4-D18), and YZZ1 (h+ trz1-1 leu1-32 his3-D1 ura4-D18 ade6-210) carrying the temperature-sensitive trz1-1 allele (39Zhao Z. Su W. Yuan S. Huang Y. Functional conservation of tRNase ZL among Saccharomyces cerevisiaeSchizosaccharomyces pombe and humans.Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and YHD1 (h+ trz2-1 leu1-32 his3-D1 ura4-D18 ade6-210) carrying the temperature-sensitive trz2-1 allele. YHD1 was originally derived from DI13 (40Irvine D.V. Goto D.B. Vaughn M.W. Nakaseko Y. McCombie W.R. Yanagida M. Martienssen R. Mapping epigenetic mutations in fission yeast using whole-genome next-generation sequencing.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which displays a temperature-sensitive phenotype resulting from mutation of Ala to Val at position 623 of trz2 (which was called trz1 in that work). However, compared with the wild-type strain, DI13 grows extremely slowly in Edinburgh minimal medium even under permissive conditions, making subsequent analysis very hard. We thus constructed the same temperature-sensitive allele of trz2 (which we termed trz2-1) in the YAS56 strain background as follows. A targeting vector containing the 1.3-kb C-terminal coding sequence of trz2, its 293-bp terminator sequence, 1.5 kb of KanMX6, and the 730-bp 3′-flanking sequence of trz2 was linearized with SalI and used to transform YAS56. Transformants selected on yeast extract supplement (YES) medium (0.5% yeast extract, 3% (w/v) glucose, and 225 mg/liter each adenine, histidine, leucine, and uracil) containing 100 mg/liter G418 were patched onto YES medium and grown at 26 °C. Patches of cells were then replica-plated onto the same plates and grown at 37 °C. The trz2-1 mutant was identified by screening for colonies that grew at 26 °C but not at 37 °C, and the trz2-1 allele was sequenced to check for the A623V mutation. The trz2-1 cells grew faster than DI13 but still grew much more slowly than wild-type cells. Standard media and protocols for genetic manipulation of fission yeast were used as described previously (41Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Molecular genetic analysis of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar). The trz1-1 and trz2-1 mutants and their isogenic wild-type strains were grown overnight in YES medium at 26 °C. Subsequently, the cells were diluted with fresh YES medium to an A600 of 0.2. When the cells reached an A600 of 0.6–0.8, they were shifted to 37 °C. At the indicated times, a sample was withdrawn, and total RNA was isolated. RNA purification and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (39Zhao Z. Su W. Yuan S. Huang Y. Functional conservation of tRNase ZL among Saccharomyces cerevisiaeSchizosaccharomyces pombe and humans.Biochem. J. 2009; 422: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated using the acid guanidinium/thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method, separated on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The blots were probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes complementary to precursors or mature forms of mt-tRNAs. The sequences of oligonucleotide probes used for Northern blots are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Nucleotide sequences of probes used in Northern blot analysisProbeSequence (5′ to 3′)ILysCTTCTGATACCATTCGTAAGAGTCMLysCAACCTTCTGATTAAGAGTCAGACIValTGCGAACTGTAAATGTTMValGGACCGTCTGCGTGTTAAGCAGAAmitPLysGTTCTTTTATTTATGGGTCTGmitMLysCCTTATCCTATCGCTTAAAAGmitPArgTACCTCATTAACACTTTATAGGmitMArgAACACTTTATAGGATTTGAACCmitPHisATCACTTATTATCGGATAGGmitMHisGCCACAAATAAGCATTCT Open table in a new tab Total RNA from S. pombe cells was isolated using an E.Z.N.A.TM yeast RNA kit (Omega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by on-column DNase I treatment as described in the TransGen Biotech manual. The absence of genomic DNA was verified by PCR using primers specific for ain1 (α-actinin). RNA quality was verified on a 1.2% agarose gel and spectrophotometric analysis using a NanoDrop 1000 instrument (Thermo Scientific). 1–2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and the Transcript First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix kit (TransGen Biotech) in a 20-μl total volume. qRT-PCR was performed in triplicates on a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The primers listed in Table 2 were designed at the adjacent sides of the junctions of mitochondrial tRNA-mRNA and tRNA-rRNA. The PCRs were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 200 nm primers, 2.5–5 ng of product from reverse transcription, 1× TransStartTM Eco Green qPCR SuperMix, and 1× Passive Reference Dye I. The mean threshold cycle number (Ct) of triplicate reactions was determined using StepOne v2.2.2 software. Relative -fold changes in the levels of precursor RNAs in temperature-sensitive trz1 or trz2 mutant cells relative to wild-type cells were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method, with normalization to act1 mRNA levels.
