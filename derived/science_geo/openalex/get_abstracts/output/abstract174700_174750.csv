Lack of fucose on the IgG1 had no effect on binding to human FcγRI, C1q, or the neonatal Fc receptor. Although no change in affinity was found for the His131 polymorphic form of human FcγRIIA, a slight improvement in binding was evident for FcγRIIB and the Arg131 FcγRIIA polymorphic form. In contrast, binding of the fucose-deficient IgG1 to human FcγRIIIA was improved up to 50-fold. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays using purified peripheral blood monocytes or natural killer cells from several donors showed enhanced cytotoxicity, especially evident at lower antibody concentrations. When combined with an IgG1 Fc protein variant that exhibited enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, the lack of fucose was synergistic.

Carbohydrate composition also influences the activity of IgG in the classical pathway of complement activation, which is initiated by IgG1 binding to C1q (3Jefferis R. Lund J. Pound J.D. Immunol.

The role of carbohydrate in the clearance rate of IgG remains unclear. Binding of aglycosyl IgG to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)1 appears unperturbed (12Shields R.L. Namenuk A.K. Hong K. Meng Y.G.

Clearance of mAb may also be affected by variation in galactosylation through binding of agalactosyl IgG to mannose-binding protein or mannose receptors (10Malhotra R. Wormald M.R. Rudd P.M.

For IgG from either serum or produced ex vivo in hybridomas or engineered cells, the IgG are heterogeneous with respect to the Asn297-linked carbohydrate (3Jefferis R. Lund J. Pound J.D. Immunol.

For human IgG the core oligosaccharide normally consists of Asn297-Nδ2- GlcNAc(fucose)-GlcNAc-mannose-(mannose-GlcNAc)2(Fig. 1). Variation among individual IgG includes attachment of galactose and/or galactose-sialic acid at one or both of the terminal GlcNAc and/or attachment of a third GlcNAc arm (bisecting GlcNAc). The presence or absence of terminal galatose or sialic acid residues affects IgG function (11Wright A. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3393-3402PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jassal R. Jenkins N.

Jean-Mairet J. Moudry R. Amstutz H. Bailey J.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 26Davies J. Jiang L. Pan L.-Y. LaBarre M.J. Anderson D. Reff M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2001; 74: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A connection between IgG glycosylation and some human diseases has been shown (e.g. the level of galactosylation appears correlated with rheumatoid arthritis) (27Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Sutton B.J. Fernandes D.L. Leung A. Stanworth D. Rademacher T.W. Mizuochi T. Taniguchi T. Matsuda K. Takeuchi F. Nagano Y. Miyamoto T. Kobata A.

Today. 2000; 21: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Some of these (e.g. mAbs that bind to a receptor or soluble ligand and thereby block ligand-receptor interaction) may function without utilizing antibody effector mechanisms. Abrogating immune system recruitment for these mAbs can be achieved by altering IgG residues in the lower hinge region (29Armour K.L. Clark M.R. Hadley A.G. Williamson L.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2613-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Duncan A.R. Woof J.M. Partridge L.J. Burton D.R. Winter G. Nature. 1988; 332: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), using IgG2 or IgG4 subclasses, which are relatively less efficient in effector function, or using F(ab) or F(ab′)2 fragments (although these may have undesirable clearance rates). Other mAbs may need to recruit the immune system to kill the target cell (31Sampson J.H. Crotty L.E. Lee S. Archer G.E. Ashley D.M. Wikstrand C.J. Hale L.P. Small C. Dranoff G. Friedman A.H.

In those circumstances where recruitment of immune effector cells is desirable for therapeutic mAb efficacy, engineering the IgG Fc portion to improve effector function (via improved binding to IgG receptors and/or complement) could be a valuable enhancement to antibody therapeutics. Currently, methods that improve the immune system recruitment include bispecific antibodies in which one arm of the antibody binds to an IgG receptor (35Segal D.M. Weiner G.J. Weiner L.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 248: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), IgG-cytokine fusion proteins (36Penichet M.L. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol.

To evaluate the role of fucosylated oligosaccharide in IgG function, the Lec13 cell line (38Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was utilized to express human IgG1. This Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line is deficient in its ability to add fucose but provided IgG with oligosaccharide that was otherwise similar to that found in normal CHO cell lines and from human serum (18Jefferis R. Lund J. Mizutani H. Nakagawa H. Kawazoe Y. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Raju S. Briggs J.B. Borge S.M. Jones A.J.S.

The resultant IgGs were used to evaluate the effect of fucosylated carbohydrate on antibody effector functions, including binding to human FcγR, human C1q, human FcRn, and ADCC using human effector cells. The heavy and light chains of Hu4D5 (40Carter P. Presta L. Gorman C.M. Ridgway J.B.B. Henner D. Wong W.L.T. Rowland A.M. Kotts C. Carver M.E. Shepard M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1774-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with the modification of a puromycin site fused 5′ to the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) site to form a fusion gene. Puromycin is used as a selective marker in DHFR(+) cells such as the Lec13 cells and the DHFR site was retained for methotrexate amplification of the stable cell line. The CHO cell line Pro-Lec13.6a (Lec13), was obtained from Professor Pamela Stanley of Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University. Parental lines were Pro− (proline auxotroph) and GAT− (glycine, adenosine, thymidine auxotroph). The CHO-DP12 cell line used for wild-type antibodies is a derivative of the CHO-K1 cell line (ATCC number CCL-61) which is DHFR-deficient and has a reduced requirement for insulin. Cell lines were transfected with cDNA using the Superfect method (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Selection of stably transfected Lec13 cells expressing mAbs was performed using puromycin dihydrochloride (Calbiochem) at 10 μg/ml in growth medium containing minimal essential medium-α medium with l-glutamine, ribonucleosides, and deoxyribonucleosides (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Selection of wild-type CHO-DP12 cells was performed in growth medium containing Ham's F-12 without GHT (glycine, hypoxanthine, thymidine), low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glycine with NaHCO3, supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Colonies formed within 2–3 weeks and were pooled for expansion. The pools were seeded initially at 3 × 106 cells/10-cm plate for small batch protein expression. The cells were converted to serum-free medium once they grew to 90–95% confluence, and after 3–5 days cell supernatants were collected and quantified for mAb expression using both an anti-IgG-Fc and an anti-intact IgG ELISA. For each batch of mAb, Lec13 and wild-type CHO cells were seeded at ∼8 × 106 cells/15-cm plate 1 day prior to converting to PSO4 (43Mather, J. P., and Tsao, M. C. (June 16, 1992) U. S. Patent 5,122,469Google Scholar) production medium, supplemented with 10 mg/liter recombinant human insulin and 1 mg/liter trace elements (43Mather, J. P., and Tsao, M. C. (June 16, 1992) U. S. Patent 5,122,469Google Scholar). Cells remained in serum-free production medium for 3–5 days. Supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation in 150-ml conical tubes to remove cells and debris. The protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and aprotinin (Sigma) were added, and the supernatants were concentrated 5-fold on stirred cells using MWCO30 filters (Amicon, Beverly, MA) prior to immediate purification using protein A chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). All proteins were buffer-exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline using Centriprep-30 concentrators (Amicon) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined using A280 and verified using amino acid composition analysis. On average, the Lec13 cells generated 10 μg of mAb per 15-cm plate; expression in control CHO cells for all antibodies was 4–5 times higher than in the Lec13 cells. Antibodies generated from CHO-DP12 grown on plates will be denoted as CHO-P. CHO-DP12 cells were also grown in spinner flasks. Cells were seeded at 6 × 105 cells/ml and grown at 37 °C for 2 days. On the third day, the temperature was shifted to 33 °C, and the cells were allowed to grow until viability dropped to 70% due to the pH dropping to ∼6.5. Antibodies derived from CHO-DP12 cells grown in spinner flasks will be denoted as CHO-S. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectral analysis was used to characterize the Asn297-linked oligosaccharides on the mAbs following a previously described protocol (12Shields R.L.

Immunofluorescence staining of purified NK cells from an FcγRIIIA(Phe158/Phe158) donor was performed using Hu4D5 variants. NK cells were purified by negative selection and gated with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD56 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD16 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Cells were adjusted to 2 × 106/ml and incubated with 2 μg/ml Hu4D5 variants for 30 min in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% sodium azide. Cells were then washed, and antibody binding was detected by incubating with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-human IgG for 30 min. Anti-HER2 Hu4D5 mAb (40Carter P. Presta L.

In contrast, Hu4D5 mAbs from stably transfected CHO-DP12 cells cultured in spinner flasks (CHO-S) or plates (CHO-P) showed about 98% fucosylated carbohydrate. The variation in galactosylation for the Lec13 mAbs was similar to that found for CHO-S mAbs (as opposed to CHO-P) (Table I); hence, CHO-S mAbs were used as reference in the binding assays.Table ICarbohydrate analysis of antibodiesVariant1-aHu4D5, humanized anti-p185HER2 IgG1 (40); HuE27, humanized anti-IgE IgG1 (41); CHO-S, IgG expressed by CHO cells in spinner flasks; CHO-P, IgG expressed by CHO cells on 15-cm plates; Lec, IgG expressed by Lec13 cells on 15-cm plates; HEK, IgG expressed by human embryonic kidney 293 cells on 15-cm plates; AAA, S298A/E333A/K334A IgG1 variant (12).

However, beyond this number the condensate collapses. Condensates constrained to one-dimensional motion with attractive interactions are predicted to form stable solitons, in which the attractive forces exactly compensate for wave-packet dispersion. Here we report the formation of bright solitons of (7)Li atoms in a quasi-one-dimensional optical trap, by magnetically tuning the interactions in a stable Bose-Einstein condensate from repulsive to attractive. The solitons are set in motion by offsetting the optical potential, and are observed to propagate in the potential for many oscillatory cycles without spreading. We observe a soliton train, containing many solitons; repulsive interactions between neighbouring solitons are inferred from their motion."

https://openalex.org/W2111884469,"Body size and temperature are the two most important variables affecting nearly all biological rates and times. The relationship of size and temperature to development is of particular interest, because during ontogeny size changes and temperature often varies. Here we derive a general model, based on first principles of allometry and biochemical kinetics, that predicts the time of ontogenetic development as a function of body mass and temperature. The model fits embryonic development times spanning a wide range of egg sizes and incubation temperatures for birds and aquatic ectotherms (fish, amphibians, aquatic insects and zooplankton). The model also describes nearly 75% of the variation in post-embryonic development among a diverse sample of zooplankton. The remaining variation is partially explained by stoichiometry, specifically the whole-body carbon to phosphorus ratio. Development in other animals at other life stages is also described by this model. These results suggest a general definition of biological time that is approximately invariant and common to all organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2168198049,"In vivo whole-cell recordings revealed that during repeated stimulation, synaptic responses to deflection of facial whiskers rapidly adapt. Extracellular recordings in the somatosensory thalamus revealed that part of the adaptation occurs subcortically, but because cortical adaptation is stronger and recovers more slowly, cortical mechanisms must also contribute. Trains of sensory stimuli that produce profound sensory adaptation did not alter intrinsic membrane properties, including resting membrane potential, input resistance, and current-evoked firing. Synaptic input evoked via intracortical stimulation was also unchanged; however, synaptic input from the somatosensory thalamus was depressed by sensory stimulation, and this depression recovered with a time course matching that of the recovery of sensory responsiveness. These data strongly suggest that synaptic depression of thalamic input to the cortex contributes to the dynamic regulation of neuronal sensitivity during rapid changes in sensory input."

We propose that evolution was likely to have optimized neural circuits to minimize conduction delays in axons, passive cable attenuation in dendrites, and the length of ""wire"" used to construct circuits, and to have maximized the density of synapses. Here we ask the question: ""What fraction of the volume should be taken up by axons and dendrites (i.e., wire) when these variables are at their optimal values?"" The biophysical properties of axons and dendrites dictate that wire should occupy 3/5 of the volume in an optimally wired gray matter. We have measured the fraction of the volume occupied by each cellular component and find that the volume of wire is close to the predicted optimal value."

There is no classical estrogen response element in the cyclin D1 promoter, and induction by ERα has been mapped to an alternative response element, a cyclic AMP-response element at −57, with possible participation of an activating protein-1 site at −954. The action of ERβ at the cyclin D1 promoter is unknown, although evidence suggests that ERβ may inhibit the proliferative action of ERα. We examined the response of cyclin D1 promoter constructs by luciferase assay and the response of the endogenous protein by Western blot in HeLa cells transiently expressing ERα, ERαK206A (a derivative that is superactive at alternative response elements), or ERβ. In each case, ER activation at the cyclin D1 promoter is mediated by both the cyclic AMP-response element and the activating protein-1 site, which play partly redundant roles. The activation by ERβ occurs only with antiestrogens. Estrogens, which activate cyclin D1 gene expression with ERα, inhibit expression with ERβ. Strikingly, the presence of ERβ completely inhibits cyclin D1 gene activation by estrogen and ERα or even by estrogen and the superactive ERαK206A.

In contrast, ERβ knockout (βERKO) female mice have full estrogen responses of the reproductive tract, and males have a full response of the prostate. Indeed, there is suggestive evidence that ERβ may modulate the proliferative effects of ERα. Thus, the βERKOs are reported to have exaggerated estrogen responses in the uterus and to have spontaneous hyperplasia of the prostate, although the latter observation is not free of controversy (11Weihua Z.

Estrogen receptors (ERs) regulate gene expression in two ways. In the classical mode of action, ERs bind directly to classical estrogen response elements (EREs) within promoters of estrogen-regulated target genes. Tethered on the DNA, the ERs recruit p160-CBP and possibly DRIP/TRAP coactivator complexes that remodel chromatin and mediate function of the transcriptional machinery (17McKenna N.J., Xu, J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In a second mode of action, ERs regulate transcription at promoter elements that directly bind heterologous transcription factors. These promoter elements include AP-1 sites that bind Jun/Fos (18Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Scanlan T.S. Shiau A.K. Uht R.M. Webb P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Horm. 2001; 62: 231-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sites for AP-1, CRE, or Sp1 do not bind directly ERs, and regulation is presumed to occur through protein-protein interactions. The two ERs have a similar domain structure and similar actions at EREs (5Pettersson K. Gustafsson J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The central DNA binding domain is highly conserved between ERα and ERβ, and the C-terminal ligand binding domain, which is responsible for high affinity ligand binding, dimerization, and hormone-dependent activation (AF-2), is moderately conserved. Only the N-terminal region is poorly conserved; ERα, but not ERβ, has a hormone-independent activation function (AF-1) (23Delaunay F. Pettersson K. Tujague M. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Given the conservation, it is not surprising that ERα and ERβ interact with the same spectrum of EREs and exhibit similar patterns of gene activation at classical ERE-containing target genes. Thus, both ERα and ERβ activate gene expression from either consensus or divergent EREs. There are nonetheless subtle differences between the two ERs. In particular, ERβ requires higher levels of 17-β-estradiol (E2) for activation at an ERE than does ERα (24Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pettersson K. Delaunay F. Gustafsson J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4970-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In cells that have both ERα and ERβ, heterodimers are the dominant species. In these heterodimers, ERβ functions as a transdominant inhibitor of ERα with subsaturating hormone levels, although ERβ does not interfere with ERα-activated transcription at saturating levels of hormone (24Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pettersson K. Delaunay F. Gustafsson J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4970-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Despite their similar action at EREs, ERα and ERβ have completely different effects at AP-1 sites. ERα activates and ERβ inhibits transcription from an AP-1 site when the receptors are complexed to 17-β-estradiol (26Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S.

Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At Sp1 sites, the differences between the ERs are less dramatic; ERα activates with multiple ligands, but in a cell-specific manner, and ERβ is nearly inactive (21Saville B. Wormke M. Wang F.

Horm. 2001; 62: 231-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The model for ER action at AP-1 sites is more complicated. It has been proposed that ERα is present at AP-1 sites through contact with p160-CBP coactivators that have been recruited by Jun/Fos. ERα-estrogen is believed to trigger the ability of coactivator to stimulate transcription (18Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Scanlan T.S. Shiau A.K. Uht R.M. Webb P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that ERβ-raloxifene, in contrast, is not present at the AP-1 site within the promoter and functions instead by serving as a decoy for inhibitors that would otherwise dampen transcription (18Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Scanlan T.S. Shiau A.K. Uht R.M. Webb P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). One important target gene through which estrogen-complexed ERα mediates its proliferative action on mammary cancer cells in culture is cyclin D1, a major regulator of entry into the proliferative stage of the cell cycle (28Planas-Silva M.D. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4059-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 29Prall O.W. Rogan E.M. Sutherland R.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a strong correlation between increased proliferative response and increased levels of cyclin D1 mRNA with increased levels of ERα overexpression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (30Wilcken N.R. Prall O.W. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 849-854PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of ERα−estrogen on cyclin D1 protein expression appears to be predominantly transcriptional with increased expression of cyclin D1 mRNA preceding changes in cyclin D1 protein (31Prall O.W.J.

Watts C.K. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The abundance of cyclin D1 rises during estrogen-provoked proliferation and declines following exposure to antiestrogens in ERα-positive MCF-7 cells (33Watts C.K. Brady A. Sarcevic B. deFazio A. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1804-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 34Musgrove E.A. Hui R. Sweeney K.J. Watts C.K. Sutherland R.L. J. Mammary Gland Biol.

Symp. 1995; 191: 218-234PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, the estrogen-provoked entry into the cell cycle is blocked by antisense cyclin D1 or by microinjection of anti-cyclin D1 antibodies, whereas the blockade imposed by antiestrogens can be overcome by cyclin D1 gene expression in MCF-7 cells (32Prall O.W.

Although cyclin D1 gene transcription is directly inducible by estrogen, there is no ERE-related sequence in the promoter region (38Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Mueller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the cyclin D1 promoter contains multiple regulatory elements, including binding sites for AP-1, STAT5, NF-κB, E2F, Oct1, Sp1, Myc/Max, Egr, Ets, CRE, and TCF/LEF (see Ref. 39Allan A.L. Albanese C. Pestell R.G. LaMarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27272-27280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and references therein). Sabbah et al. (20Sabbah M. Courilleau D. Mester J. Redeuilh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) showed that E2induced reporter gene activity in MCF-7 cells transfected with a construct containing the −973 to +139 region of the cyclin D1 promoter. Deletion analysis of this promoter in ER-negative HeLa cells identified a variant CRE at −57 as the E2-responsive region (20Sabbah M. Courilleau D. Mester J. Redeuilh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11217-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). This variant CRE appeared to bind Jun/ATF-2. Altucciet al. mapped the estrogen-responsive region to a fragment between −994 and −136 of the cyclin D1 promoter (40Altucci L. Addeo R. Cicatiello L. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Truss M. Beato M. Sica V. Bresciani F. Weisz A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2315-2324PubMed Google Scholar). Several potential binding sites for known transcription factors can be found in this region of the promoter including the AP-1 site at −954, indicating that this AP-1 site has a potential contribution. Recently, Safe and colleagues (41Castro-Rivera E. Samudio I. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30853-30861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) reported that the Sp1 site in the cyclin D1 promoter also contributed to the estrogen response with ERα. The cyclin D1 gene and its induction by ERα also appear to play a key role in estrogen-provoked proliferation in vivo (42Steeg P.S. Zhou Q. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 52: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cyclin D1 gene is amplified in up to 20% of human breast cancers, whereas cyclin D1 protein is overexpressed in over 50% of human mammary carcinomas, including those that are estrogen-responsive (43Dickson C. Fantl V. Gillett C. Brookes S. Bartek J. Smith R. Fisher C. Barnes D. Peters G. Cancer Lett. 1995; 90: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 44Schuuring E.

Targeted overexpression of cyclin D1 protein in mammary epithelial cells leads to ductal hyperproliferation and eventual tumor formation (47Wang T.C. Cardiff R.D. Zukerberg L. Lees E. Arnold A. Schmidt E.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Mice nullizygous for cyclin D1 show profound defects in estrogen-driven mammary lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy, indicating that the induction of the cyclin D1 gene plays a critical role in the maturation of this tissue (48Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B., Li, T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 49Fantl V.

Biol. 1999; 212: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that cyclin D1 gene knockout mice still had estrogen-stimulated ductal elongation and branching during puberty and early pregnancy. Nonetheless, a recent study has shown that cyclin D1-deficient mice are resistant to breast cancers induced by theneu and ras oncogenes (51Yu Q. Geng Y. Sicinski P. Nature. 2001; 411: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Whereas the above studies suggest a pathway for ERα action at the cyclin D1 gene and subsequent proliferation, they leave the role of ERβ unclear. The suggestion from the ER knock-out studies is that ERβ may modulate the proliferative effects of ERα, but the matter is controversial. Furthermore, there is some uncertainty as to the exact elements in the cyclin D1 promoter that mediate the effects of ERα. We therefore sought to confirm the cis-elements in the cyclin D1 promoter that are required for the transcriptional activation of the gene targeted by human ERs and determine how ERβ acts at the cyclin D1 promoter. In the present study, the response elements of the cyclin D1 promoter targeted by ERs were mapped to the CRE as well as the AP-1 site, with the CRE predominant. Unlike ERα, ERβ complexed to 17-β-estradiol repressed cyclin D1 gene transcription and blocked ERα-mediated induction when both receptors were present. This suggests that ERβ may indeed modulate the proliferative effects of ERα−estrogen by blocking its action at the cyclin D1 gene or other key pro-proliferative target genes containing CRE or AP-1 sites. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 Coon's modified medium (Sigma) with 15 mmHepes, l-glutamine (0.438 g/liter), NaHCO3(1.338 g/liter), 8% iron-supplemented calf serum (Sigma), and penicillin/streptomycin.

ERE-II-LUC and the full-length human ERα cDNA (HEO) in pSG5 expression vector have been previously described (27Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length human ERβ cDNA in pCMV5 expression vector was moved into pSG5 vector as anEcoRI and HindIII fragment, and the orientation of the insert was confirmed by sequencing. The ERαK206A mutant was introduced into the full-length ERα cDNA in pSG5 vector by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit; Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. The ERαK206A creates a point mutation in the codon coding for lysine 206 into alanine in the first zinc finger of the human ERα DNA binding domain. The oligonucleotide containing the desired nucleotide changes for ERαK206A was 5′-CTGTGAGGGCTGCGCTGCCTTCTTCAAGAG-3′, and its complementary strand is 5′-CTCTTGAAGAAGGCA- GCGCAGCCCTCACAG-3′. Cells were grown to a density of not more than 5 × 104cells/cm2. HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation. 2–3 million cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 10% glucose and 10 μg/ml BioBrene (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a single 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvette with 2.5 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid and the expression vector plasmid and 1.0 μg of actin-β-galactosidase plasmid internal control. Cells were electroporated at 0.24 kV, 960 microfarads in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II apparatus (Bio-Rad). Following electroporation, the cells were immediately resuspended in growth medium, plated into 12-well dishes at 1 ml/well, and treated with ligands (ICI 182780 (1 μm), raloxifene (1 μm), tamoxifen (5 μm), E2 (0.1 μm), DES (0.1 μm), or ethyl alcohol vehicle control). After 40–48 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were lysed by first removing the medium from the wells, washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and then adding 0.1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris (pH 7.8) and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were then measured using standard luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) and β-galactosidase detection kits (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA). Luciferase activities were normalized for β-galactosidase activities. Individual transfections (each containing data from triplicate wells) were repeated three times. HeLa cells were transfected with human ERα, ERβ, and ERαK206A expression plasmids by electroporation and treated with ligands as above. After 46–48 h of treatment, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and harvested in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, aprotinin (Sigma)). The whole cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with a monoclonal antibody against human cyclin D1 (HD11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase second antibody. The immune complexes were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Invitrogen). Autoradiograms from Western blots were quantitated using NIH Image 1.62 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A gel quantification macro was used to generate density peaks for each band based on an internal optical density standard. Peaks were user-defined, and the area under the curve for each density peak was measured. Measurements were made on each of three different Western blots. Graphs represent mean values, and error bars represent the S.D. We examined the transactivation properties of human ERα expressed in HeLa cells on a series of cyclin D1 gene promoter constructs driving luciferase. In particular, we compared a reporter plasmid that contained the wild-type cyclin D1 promoter (−963CD1LUC) with a similar reporter carrying mutations in the AP-1 site (−963AP1mtCD1LUC), in CRE (−963CREmtCD1LUC), or in both the AP-1 site and the CRE (−1745AP1/CREmtCD1LUC). The estrogens (17-β-estradiol and diethylstilbesterol) up-regulated the ERα action at the wild-type cyclin D1 gene promoter, and antiestrogens had a modest but valuable effect (Fig.1 A). Induction with E2 and DES was around 3-fold. The estrogen response of the AP-1 mutant was slightly, but consistently, weaker than that of the wild-type cyclin D1 promoter. The response of the CRE mutant, in contrast, was much weaker than wild-type but was not abolished. The response of the AP-1/CRE double mutant was abolished. Thus, ERα up-regulates the cyclin D1 promoter with estrogens through both the CRE and the AP-1 site, which have partly redundant functions. We also examined the expression of the endogenous cyclin D1 gene regulated by ERα in HeLa cells. We used Western blot analysis using a cyclin D1-specific antibody of extracts from ERα transiently transfected HeLa cells. A modest increase of cyclin D1 protein levels was observed in HeLa cells transiently transfected with an expression vector for ERα and treated with estrogens and a smaller increase with antiestrogens (Fig. 1 B). Cyclin D1 protein levels did not increase in HeLa cells transiently transfected with control vector after treatment with antiestrogens and estrogens (data not shown). ERα is unique among the nuclear receptors in its ability to enhance AP-1-mediated transcription with the estrogen. Other nuclear receptors, such as glucocorticoid receptor and thyroid receptor, repress AP-1-dependent transcription in response to their cognate hormone. Interestingly, a point mutation at the base of the first zinc finger of the DNA binding domain converts glucocorticoid receptor and thyroid receptor from inhibitors to AP-1 activators (57Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When we introduced the homologous mutation (K206A) into the first zinc finger of the DNA binding domain of human ERα, we found that the mutant receptor (ERαK206A) was superactive at target genes regulated by AP-1 but underactive at target genes with classical EREs. This pattern occurred in cell culture and in transgenic mice. 2B. Anderegg and R. M. Uht, unpublished results. In accord with these results, ERαK206A enhanced transcriptional activity at the cyclin D1 promoter about 20-fold with estrogens and was consistently 7–10-fold more active than ERα (Fig.2 A). No activation occurred with antiestrogens in contrast to the weak activation observed with ERα. Because the transcriptional effect of ERαK206A on cyclin D1 promoter was so profound, we explored whether expression of the endogenous cyclin D1 gene in HeLa cells might also respond to transient transfection with this superactive receptor. Cyclin D1 protein levels consistently rose in HeLa cells transiently"

The present study investigated sigma receptor signal transduction by reconstituting responses in Xenopus oocytes. Sigma receptors modulated voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv1.4 or Kv1.5) in different ways in the presence and absence of ligands. Association between Kv1.4 channels and sigma receptors was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. These results indicate a novel mechanism of signal transduction dependent on protein-protein interactions. Domain accessibility experiments suggested a structure for the sigma receptor with two cytoplasmic termini and two membrane-spanning segments. The ligand-independent effects on channels suggest that sigma receptors serve as auxiliary subunits to voltage-gated K+ channels with distinct functional interactions, depending on the presence or absence of ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1994901510,"Five adenosines within the coding sequence of the serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2C) pre-mRNA are converted to inosines by RNA editing (named A, B, C' (E), C, and D sites). In human prefrontal cortex (PFC), the most abundant 5-HT2C mRNA sequences result from editing at the A site, or from the editing combinations AC'C, ABCD, and ABD. In suicide victims with a history of major depression, C' site editing is significantly increased, D site editing is significantly decreased, and the C site shows a trend toward increased editing. Treatment of mice with the antidepressant drug fluoxetine (Prozac) causes changes in C', C, and D site editing that are exactly opposite to those seen in suicide victims. Thus, one outcome of fluoxetine treatment may be to reverse the abnormalities in 5-HT2C pre-mRNA editing seen in depressed suicide victims."

Here we show that CREB is phosphorylated on its transcriptional regulatory site, Ser-133, in vivo in a neurotrophin-dependent manner. In mice harboring a null mutation in the Creb gene, sensory neurons exhibit excess apoptosis and degeneration, and display impaired axonal growth and projections. Interestingly, excess apoptosis is not observed in the central nervous system. CREB is required within sensory and sympathetic neurons for survival and axon extension since both of these neurotrophin-dependent processes are compromised in cultured neurons from CREB null mice. Thus, during their period of neurotrophin dependency, peripheral neurons require CREB-mediated gene expression for both survival and growth in vivo."

Here we show that RIM binding proteins (RBPs), which associate with Ca(2+) channels in hair cells, photoreceptors, and neurons, interact with alpha(1D) (L type) and alpha(1B) (N type) Ca(2+) channel subunits. RBPs contain three Src homology 3 domains that bind to proline-rich motifs in alpha(1) subunits and Rab3-interacting molecules (RIMs). Overexpression in PC12 cells of fusion proteins that suppress the interactions of RBPs with RIMs and alpha(1) augments the exocytosis triggered by depolarization. RBPs may regulate the strength of synaptic transmission by creating a functional link between the synaptic-vesicle tethering apparatus, which includes RIMs and Rab3, and the fusion machinery, which includes Ca(2+) channels and the SNARE complex."
https://openalex.org/W2036378627,"After attachment to receptors, reovirus virions are internalized by endocytosis and exposed to acid-dependent proteases that catalyze viral disassembly. Previous studies using the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 and a mutant cell line that does not support reovirus disassembly suggest a requirement for specific endocytic proteases in reovirus entry. This study identifies the endocytic proteases that mediate reovirus disassembly in murine fibroblast cells. Infection of both L929 cells treated with the cathepsin L inhibitor Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl ketone and cathepsin L-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts resulted in inefficient proteolytic disassembly of viral outer-capsid proteins and decreased viral yields. In contrast, both L929 cells treated with the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me and cathepsin B-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts support reovirus disassembly and growth. However, removal of both cathepsin B and cathepsin L activity completely abrogates disassembly and growth of reovirus. Concordantly, cathepsin L mediates reovirus disassembly more efficiently than cathepsin B in vitro. These results demonstrate that either cathepsin L or cathepsin B is required for reovirus entry into murine fibroblasts and indicate that cathepsin L is the primary mediator of reovirus disassembly. Moreover, these findings suggest that specific endocytic proteases can determine host cell susceptibility to infection by intracellular pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2019062483,"Siglecs are sialic acid-recognizing animal lectins of the immunoglobulin superfamily. We have cloned and characterized a novel human molecule, Siglec-11, that belongs to the subgroup of CD33/Siglec-3-related Siglecs. As with others in this subgroup, the cytosolic domain of Siglec-11 is phosphorylated at tyrosine residue(s) upon pervanadate treatment of cells and then recruits the protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2. However, Siglec-11 has several novel features relative to the other CD33/Siglec-3-related Siglecs. First, it binds specifically to alpha2-8-linked sialic acids. Second, unlike other CD33/Siglec-3-related Siglecs, Siglec-11 was not found on peripheral blood leukocytes. Instead, we observed its expression on macrophages in various tissues, such as liver Kupffer cells. Third, it was also expressed on brain microglia, thus becoming the second Siglec to be found in the nervous system. Fourth, whereas the Siglec-11 gene is on human chromosome 19, it lies outside the previously described CD33/Siglec-3-related Siglec cluster on this chromosome. Fifth, analyses of genome data bases indicate that Siglec-11 has no mouse ortholog and that it is likely to be the last canonical human Siglec to be reported. Finally, although Siglec-11 shows marked sequence similarity to human Siglec-10 in its extracellular domain, the cytosolic tail appears only distantly related. Analysis of genomic regions surrounding the Siglec-11 gene suggests that it is actually a chimeric molecule that arose from relatively recent gene duplication and recombination events, involving the extracellular domain of a closely related ancestral Siglec gene (which subsequently became a pseudogene) and a transmembrane and cytosolic tail derived from another ancestral Siglec."

Integrins can sense mechanical forces arising from the matrix and convert these stimuli to chemical signals capable of modulating intracellular signal transduction. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is a major regulator of cell survival. It is not known, however, whether integrins, acting as mechanoreceptors, regulate cell survival via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Here, we show that in response to a matrix-derived mechanical stimulus, β1integrin regulated cell viability by regulating Akt activity in a PI3K-dependent fashion. To accomplish this, we employed fibroblasts cultured in collagen gels. During contraction of collagen matrices, fibroblasts underwent apoptosis. We demonstrate that ligation of β1 integrin with anti-β1 integrin antibodies protected fibroblasts from apoptosis. The nature of the survival signal activated by β1 integrin engagement with antibody was mediated by PI3K acting through Akt/protein kinase B. We show that Akt phosphorylation decreased during collagen contraction and that this decrease correlated precisely with the onset of fibroblast apoptosis. Fibroblasts transfected with constitutively active PI3K displayed increased Akt phosphorylation and were protected from anoikis and collagen gel contraction-induced apoptosis.

We show that Akt phosphorylation decreased during collagen contraction and that this decrease correlated precisely with the onset of fibroblast apoptosis. Fibroblasts transfected with constitutively active PI3K displayed increased Akt phosphorylation and were protected from anoikis and collagen gel contraction-induced apoptosis. Our data identify a novel role for β1 integrin in regulating fibroblast viability through a PI3K/Akt/protein kinase B signaling pathway in response to a matrix-derived mechanical stimulus. extracellular matrix phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase protein kinase B monoclonal antibody terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K internal ribosome entry site green fluorescent protein fluorescence-activated cell sorter Integrins are a family of αβ-heterodimeric cell-surface receptors that mediate attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 (1Ruoslahti E. Tumor Biol. 1996; 17: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Integrins associate with signaling molecules in the focal adhesion complex, which serves as a signaling device and provides a direct link to the cytoskeleton (1Ruoslahti E.

The continuous link between the ECM, integrins, signaling molecules, and the cytoskeleton has led to the discovery that integrins are capable of serving as mechanoreceptors (3Davies P.F. Physiol.

As mechanoreceptors, integrins detect matrix-derived mechanical stimuli and convert these to chemical signals capable of modulating signal transduction. Integrin-ECM interaction activates signal transduction pathways that regulate a variety of cellular functions, including cell viability (7Meredith J.E., Jr. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol.

However, β1 integrin, which mediates attachment to type I collagen, can regulate cell survival (7Meredith J.E., Jr. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). The biological effects of integrin-ECM binding are mediated through the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of integrins with associated lipid and protein kinases.

Evidence has emerged demonstrating the important role of an integrin/PI3K/Akt/PKB signaling pathway in regulating epithelial cell survival (22Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 23Lee J.W. Juliano R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1973-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Attachment of these cells to the underlying basement membrane via integrins activates the PI3K/Akt/PKB survival signal. However, upon detachment, epithelial cells undergo anoikis. Unlike epithelial cells, which are polarized and attach to the underlying basement membrane at their basal surface, mesenchymal cells are frequently surrounded by the ECM. Because mesenchymal cells are surrounded by the matrix, it is unlikely that unnecessary mesenchymal cells are eliminated by detachment and anoikis. However, recent studies indicate that matrix-derived mechanical signals can regulate cell survival (26Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 27Chen K.D., Li, Y.S. Kim M., Li, S. Yuan S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18393-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Currently, it is not known whether integrins, acting as mechanoreceptors, can regulate cell survival via the PI3K pathway in response to a matrix-derived mechanical stimulus. To begin to examine this issue, we employed three-dimensional type I collagen gels. We used three-dimensional collagen gels for our studies because it has been found that three-dimensional matrix adhesions differ in structure, localization, and function from two-dimensional adhesions; and therefore, three-dimensional cell-matrix interactions may be more relevant biologically (28Cukierman E. Pankov R. Stevens D.R. Yamada K.M. Science. 2001; 294: 1708-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). This is especially true in the context of examination of mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts, which typically exist encompassed by the matrix. Recently, it has been discovered that during collagen gel contraction, fibroblasts undergo apoptosis in response to changes in mechanical tension in the collagen matrix (29Grinnell F. Curr. Top. Pathol. 1999; 93: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Grinnell F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 362-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 31Fluck J.

Carlson M.A. Abrams J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 608-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is known that α2β1 integrin mediates collagen gel contraction and that β1 integrin can function as a mechanoreceptor and can also regulate cell viability. Therefore, we examined whether β1 integrin in response to a mechanical stimulus generated by collagen contraction can regulate fibroblast apoptosis. Using anti-β1 integrin antibodies, we show that ligation of β1 integrin protected fibroblasts from undergoing apoptosis in response to collagen gel contraction. The nature of the survival signal activated by β1 integrin engagement with anti-β1 integrin antibody was mediated by PI3K acting through Akt/PKB. We demonstrate that Akt activity precipitously declined during collagen matrix contraction and that this decrease correlated precisely with the onset of collagen matrix contraction-induced fibroblast apoptosis. Up-regulation of PI3K activity using fibroblasts transfected with the catalytically active p110 subunit of PI3K protected fibroblasts from undergoing anoikis in suspension cultures and apoptosis in response to collagen gel contraction. These studies identify a novel role for β1integrin in regulating fibroblast viability via modulation of a PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in response to contraction of type I collagen matrices. Human lung fibroblasts (CCL-210, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and used between passages 5 and 15. Collagen gels were prepared as described by Fluck et al. (31Fluck J. Querfeld C. Cremer A. Niland S. Krieg T. Sollberg S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 153-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Human lung fibroblasts (1.2 × 105) were resuspended in 2.0 ml of 1.5× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum. Vitrogen (3 mg/ml; Collagen Esthetics, Palo Alto, CA) was added to the cell suspension to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The cell/collagen solution was incubated in a water bath for 10 min at 37 °C; poured into 3.5-cm uncoated plastic dishes; and placed into a cell culture incubator at 10% CO2 and 37 °C, where the gels polymerized in ∼30–60 min. Mouse monoclonal antibody P5D2 (raised against the human β1 integrin subunit) was provided by Dr. Leo Furcht (University of Minnesota). Monoclonal antibody M-13 (directed against the β1 integrin chain) was a gift from Dr. Kenneth Yamada (National Institutes of Health). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 1981 and 2253 (raised against the β1 integrin chain), mAb 1950 (directed against the α2 integrin chain), mAb 1998 (raised against α2β1integrin), mAb 1973 (directed against the α1 chain of integrin), and antibody LM609 (directed against αvβ3 integrin) were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Mouse anti-human CD49b blocking antibody MCA743, which recognizes the α2 integrin subunit, was purchased from Serotec Inc. (Raleigh, NC). Anti-polyclonal Akt antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-phosphorylated Akt polyclonal antibody was purchased fromCell Signaling (Beverly, MA). TUNEL assay was performed according to the methods of Gavrieli et al. (33Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9156) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After deparaffinization, nuclei containing degraded DNA within apoptotic cells in paraffin gel sections were identified using an in situ cell death terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dideoxy-UTP-fluorescein isothiocyanate detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, fibroblasts recovered from anoikis assays and type I collagen gels were analyzed for apoptosis using an in situcell death detection kit (fluorescence TUNEL assay; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, recovered cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 60 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in TUNEL reaction mixture, incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Fibroblasts embedded in collagen gels were recovered by gel solubilization for ∼30 min at 37 °C using 0.5 ml of bacterial collagenase (2 mg/ml; Sigma). The reaction was stopped with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum; the cell solution was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min; the resultant pellet of cells was resuspended in trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline; and cells were counted. Fibroblasts were incorporated into contractile and non-contractile collagen gels for various periods of time. Gels were then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors was applied directly onto the gels for 30 min on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and lysates were precleared for 1 h at room temperature with protein G-beads and immunoprecipitated for 16 h at 4 °C with anti-Akt polyclonal antibody. Samples were processed for Western analysis. Western analysis of human lung fibroblasts was performed as previously described (34Henke C.A. Roongta U. Mickelson D.J. Knutson J.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2541-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from the cell lysate were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred (45 min, 24 V) to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 6% nonfat dry milk; incubated with the primary antibody; washed; and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The membranes were developed using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). The constitutively active p110 subunit of PI3K (CA-p110) was provided by Dr. Julian Downward. CA-p110 was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the retroviral plasmid MIGR1.str containing IRES-GFP, creating the bicistronic construct CA-p110/IRES-GFP. The packaging cell line HEK293 was cotransfected with this plasmid and the packaging vector pCL2-DNA using the CaCl2 precipitate method, and the resulting viral stock was used to infect human lung fibroblasts (CCL-210). A population of CA-p110/GFP-positive cells was obtained by cell sorting using FACS analysis. Anoikis assays were performed as described by Frisch and Francis (8Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). Tissue culture plates were coated twice with Poly-HEME (4 mg/ml in ethanol; Sigma) and rinsed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. Fibroblasts resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were plated on the Poly-HEME plates. At the indicated times, the cells in suspension were recovered and analyzed by fluorescence TUNEL assay. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Experiments were performed three times. For assessment of the percentage of apoptotic cells within collagen gels using the TUNEL assay, microscopic analysis of at least 200 cells/slide was performed. Paired evaluations were made for experimental and control conditions within each experiment, and significance was determined by Student'st test. Significance level was set at p < 0.05. It has previously been shown that primary human skin fibroblasts undergo apoptosis during contraction of collagen gels. We examined whether this also was the case for primary human lung fibroblasts. Cells were seeded into 0.5 mg/ml collagen gels in uncoated Petri dishes (contractile gels) or in tissue culture dishes (non-contractile gels). Fibroblasts incorporated into 0.5 mg/ml collagen gels in uncoated Petri dishes contracted the collagen gels from 8.0 cm2 at time 0 (time 0 = cell/collagen mixture placed into dish) to 0.8 cm2 at 24 h (Fig.1 A). Little additional collagen gel contraction occurred over the next 48 h. The degree of collagen gel contraction was inversely proportional to the concentration of the collagen gel. At 1 mg/ml, collagen gels contracted from 8.0 cm2 at time 0 to 2.3 cm2 at 24 h; and at 2 mg/ml, collagen gels contracted from 8.0 to 5.1 cm2 at 24 h (Fig. 1 A). The decrease in cell number was directly related to the degree of collagen gel contraction (Fig. 1 B). A greater proportion of cells underwent apoptosis in the highly contractile 0.5 mg/ml collagen gels as opposed to the less contractile 2 mg/ml collagen gels. The cell number in the 0.5 mg/ml collagen gels declined from 1.2 × 105 cells seeded into the gels at time 0 to (4.8 ± 0.3) × 104 cells/gel at 24 h (Fig. 1 B). By 48 h, the cell number in the 0.5 mg/ml collagen gels had dropped to (2.8 ± 0.4) × 104 cells/gel; and by 72 h, the cell number was (2.4 ± 0.4) × 104cells/gel. In contrast, at 24 h, the cell number in 2 mg/ml contractile collagen gels declined from 1.2 × 105 to (8.4 ± 0.3) × 104 cells/gel. However, at 48 h, the cell number had increased slightly to (8.8 ± 0.4) × 104 cells/gel. The numbers of fibroblasts incorporated into non-contractile collagen gels composed of varying concentrations of collagen (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml) did not change much. For example, the cell number in non-contractile gels (0.5 mg/ml collagen) increased slightly from 1.2 × 105 cells/gel at time 0 to (1.4 ± 0.4) × 105 cells/gel at 48 h. In accord with several prior reports (31Fluck J. Querfeld C. Cremer A. Niland S. Krieg T. Sollberg S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 153-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 32Grinnell F. Zhu M. Carlson M.A. Abrams J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 608-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we found that the decline in human lung fibroblast numbers during collagen gel contraction in our system was due to apoptosis. In situlabeling of DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay revealed that at 48 h, most cells within the contracted 0.5 mg/ml collagen gels were rounded up and contained nuclei staining bright reddish brown (Fig.2 A). In contrast, fibroblasts within the 2 mg/ml collagen gels were well spread, and the nuclei were negative by TUNEL assay (Fig. 2 B). The changes in cell shape noted by TUNEL assay of fibroblasts in contractile collagen gels were also noted by phase-contrast microscopy. Prior to collagen gel contraction, fibroblasts within the collagen matrix were well spread and assumed a stellate appearance with extension of filopodia into the collagen matrix (Fig.3 A). During contraction of the collagen matrix, many fibroblasts became progressively round in appearance and retracted their filopodia that were attached to the matrix. As they retracted their filopodia, the fibroblasts pulled in collagen fibrils such that a meshwork of collagen fibrils could be seen surrounding the cells (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, membrane blebbing was apparent in some rounded cells after completion of gel contraction, indicating that these cells were undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 3, C and D). α2β1 integrin mediates contraction of type I collagen gels, and the β1 integrin subunit can function as a mechanoreceptor and regulates cell viability. It has been shown that disruption of cell adhesion to the underlying matrix by interference with integrin function causes anchorage-dependent cells to undergo a form of apoptotic death known as anoikis. However, whether β1 integrin can also regulate cell viability in response to a mechanical stimulus generated by contraction of a collagen matrix is not known. We examined whether β1 integrin regulates fibroblast viability during collagen gel contraction. It has previously been shown that anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibody M-13 inhibits collagen gel contraction, whereas anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibody P5D2 has little effect on collagen gel contraction (35Seltzer J.L. Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Sudbeck B. Southon E.A. Wayner E.A. Eisen A.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both antibodies have been used to study β1integrin-mediated signal transduction in collagen gels, and both recognize the same ligand-binding domain on the β1integrin chain (amino acids 207–218) (35Seltzer J.L. Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Sudbeck B. Southon E.A. Wayner E.A. Eisen A.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that although these antibodies have blocking properties in that they can inhibit cell adhesion, this function does not preclude them from being capable of modulating cell signaling. The binding of these antibodies to fibroblasts has also been shown to regulate specific intracellular signaling pathways (35Seltzer J.L. Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Sudbeck B. Southon E.A. Wayner E.A. Eisen A.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These reagents put us in a position to separate the effect of β1 integrin signaling from gel contraction per se. Human lung fibroblasts were preincubated with various concentrations of each of the monoclonal antibodies and incorporated into collagen gels (0.5 mg/ml, 1.2 × 105 cells/gel). Consistent with previous reports (35Seltzer J.L. Lee A.Y. Akers K.T. Sudbeck B. Southon E.A. Wayner E.A. Eisen A.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we confirmed that the M-13 antibody to the β1 integrin chain inhibited collagen gel contraction in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.4 A), whereas the P5D2 antibody to β1 integrin had little effect on gel contraction (Fig.4 B). Interestingly, both the M-13 and P5D2 monoclonal antibodies protected fibroblasts from apoptosis. We expected that the M-13 monoclonal antibody might confer protection from apoptosis by virtue of its ability to inhibit lattice contraction. The M-13 antibody protected fibroblasts from apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4 C). Cell counts at 24 h were (3.7 ± 0.3) × 104 cells/gel (0 μg/ml antibody), (4.4 ± 0.4) × 104 cells/gel (1 μg/ml antibody), (5.5 ± 0.4) × 104 cells/gel (10 μg/ml antibody), and (6.3 ± 0.4) × 104cells/gel (50 μg/ml antibody). Even though the P5D2 monoclonal antibody had little effect on collagen gel contraction, like the M-13 antibody, it also inhibited induction of fibroblast apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4 D). Fibroblast cell numbers at 24 h were (4.1 ± 0.3) × 104 cells/gel (0 μg/ml antibody), (4.2 ± 0.4) × 104 cells/gel (0.1 μg/ml antibody), (7.2 ± 0.4) × 104 cells/gel (1 μg/ml antibody), and (7.9 ± 0.4) × 104 cells/gel (5 μg/ml antibody). These data indicate that direct engagement of β1 integrin with anti-β1 integrin antibody is capable of regulating fibroblast viability during collagen gel contraction. We also examined whether blocking antibodies to the α2integrin subunit would affect collagen gel contraction or the induction of apoptosis. The adhesion-blocking monoclonal antibody MCA743 (directed against the α2 integrin chain) as well as the blocking mAb 1950 (also directed against the α2 integrin subunit) did not inhibit collagen gel contraction and did not protect against apoptosis (data not shown). Furthermore, blocking monoclonal antibodies against the α1 integrin subunit, the α5 integrin subunit, and αvβ3integrin did not affect lattice contraction or cell viability. In addition, we examined the effect of RGD peptides on collagen gel contraction and induction of apoptosis. Preincubation of fibroblasts with RGD peptides did not block collagen gel contraction and did not inhibit apoptosis (data not shown). Our data indicate that the β1 integrin subunit (but not the α2integrin subunit) regulates fibroblast viability during collagen gel contraction. Several integrin-mediated viability signal transduction pathways have begun to be characterized. In epithelial and endothelial cells, the PI3K/Akt/PKB survival pathway can be activated by growth factor and integrin binding (17Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 18Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 22Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar,23Lee J.W. Juliano R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1973-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We examined whether engagement of β1 integrin on fibroblasts with antibody was capable of activating Akt/PKB. We examined the phosphorylation of Ser473 by Western blotting using a specific antibody. Phosphorylation of Ser473 of Akt indicates activation of the kinase (37Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). To perform these experiments, fibroblasts were plated on tissue culture dishes and serum-starved overnight prior to addition of anti-β1 integrin antibody. It is important to note that during these experiments, the addition of the P5D2 or M-13 antibody to fibroblasts already adhered to tissue culture plastic did not affect their attachment. However, as a control to confirm P5D2 and M-13 antibody function, preincubation of fibroblasts with either antibody inhibited their ability to adhere to tissue culture plastic (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that ligation of β1 integrin with the P5D2 antibody increased the phosphorylation of Ser473 within 30 min and began to decrease by 2 h (Fig.5 A). However, anti-β1 integrin antibody M-13 and the isotype control antibody had no effect on Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). We also sought to determine whether ligation of β1 integrin by the P5D2 antibody independent of cell adhesion would alter Akt/PKB activation. Serum-starved fibroblasts in suspension culture were treated with anti-β1 integrin antibody. Similar to adherent fibroblasts, Akt was phosphorylated at Ser473 in non-adherent fibroblasts by ligation of β1 integrin in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5 C). To determine whether activation of Akt/PKB was PI3K-dependent, the fibroblasts were pretreated with wortmannin and exposed to anti-β1 integrin antibody. Wortmannin abrogated the increase in Akt/PKB phosphorylation mediated by ligation of β1 integrin with antibody (Fig. 5 D). These data indicate that the P5D2 antibody, when preincubated with cells prior to adherence, has blocking properties in that it inhibits attachment. However, our data also show that when the P5D2 antibody binds to β1 integrin on cells that are already attached or are in suspension, it functions in an agonist fashion by activating the Akt survival signaling pathway via a PI3K-dependent mechanism.

The structures of the products from serotypes O1, O2a, O2a,c, O3, O4, O5, and O12 were determined by NMR spectroscopy and chemical methods, identifying the linkage region between the O antigens and the core as well as novel residues at the non-reducing ends of the polysaccharides. All serotypes had an identical linkage between the O chain and core.

Typically, structural diversity is greater in the regions of LPS extending from the cell surface (i.e. theO chains). Varying chemical structures in the Ochains gives rise to a number of serologically distinct Oantigens. In the Klebsiellae there are 11 knownO-chain structures, but structural similarities lead to some serological cross-reactivities, so the actual number of unique O serotypes is less (1Hansen D.S.

Several of the O-antigens are based on a structure designated d-galactan I with a repeat unit comprising [-3)-β-Galf-(1–3)-α-Galp-(1-]. 2All monosaccharides have the dconfiguration except l-Rha.2All monosaccharides have the dconfiguration except l-Rha.When present alone, this structure provides the 2a antigen (3Whitfield C. Perry M.B. MacLean L.L. Yu S.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4913-4919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it can be capped by additional structural domains or modified by side chain acetyl or galactosyl residues to generate additional unique antigens (3Whitfield C.

MacLean L.L. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Endotoxin Res. 1995; 2: 131-140Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For example, in the most clinically prevalent serotype, the O1 antigen, d-galactan I chains are capped by a domain with a different repeat unit structure, [-3)-β-Galp-(1–3)-α-Galp-(1-] (d-galactan II). Genetic (7Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. J Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4614-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and chemical (8Kol O. Wieruszeski J.M. Strecker G. Fournet B. Zalisz R. Smets P. Carbohydr.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1420-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) analyses indicate that d-galactan I chains are linked directly to the lipid A core structure, whereas d-galactan II is confined to the distal end of some of the availabled-galactan I chains (10Kol O. Wieruszeski J.M. Strecker G. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 217: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). d-Galactan II provides the epitope(s) that defines the O1 antigen (9Whitfield C. Richards J.C. Perry M.B. Clarke B.R. MacLean L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1420-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its presence is required for the resistance of the bacteria to complement-mediated killing in the host; K. pneumoniaemutants that only produce d-galactan I are therefore serum-sensitive (11McCallum K.L. Schoenhals G. Laakso D. Clarke B. Whitfield C. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3816-3822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12McCallum K.L. Laakso D.H. Whitfield C. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, not all Klebsiella O serotypes are based on d-galactan I. The prevalent O3 and O5 serotypes comprise mannan O chains with structures identical to the Escherichia coli O9 and O8 antigens, respectively (13Jansson P.E. Lonngren J. Widmalm G. Leontein K. Slettengren K. Svenson S.B. Wrangsell G. Dell A. Tiller P.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 145: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Prehm P. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The remaining Klebsiella O-chain structures are heteropolymers. The biosynthesis of the polysaccharide O chain has been investigated in some serotypes of K. pneumoniae by biochemical and genetic experimental approaches. Much of the data for the O3 and O5 serotypes is derived from the related equivalent systems in E. coli. However, the genetic loci required for synthesis of the corresponding O chain structures in E. coli (O8ec and O9ec) and K. pneumoniae (O5kp and O3kp, respectively) are essentially identical and reflect lateral gene transfer events (15Sugiyama T. Kido N. Kato Y. Koide N. Yoshida T. Yokochi T. Gene. 1997; 198: 111-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Sugiyama T. Kido N. Kato Y. Koide N. Yoshida T. Yokochi T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2775-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biosynthesis data is also available for d-galactan I (17Clarke B.R. Bronner D. Keenleyside W.J. Severn W.B. Richards J.C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Guan S. Clarke A.J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3318-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These polymannans and polygalactans are polymerized by a processive glycosyltransfer mechanism, i.e. sequential addition of monosaccharides to the non-reducing end of the nascent chain. Polymer growth occurs on a “primer” (or acceptor) consisting of undecaprenyl pyrophosphoryl (und-PP)-linked GlcNAc. This compound is formed by WecA, a UDP-GlcNAc:undecaprenyl phosphate GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase that forms und-PP-GlcNAc (19Meier-Dieter U. Starman R. Barr K. Mayer H. Rick P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13490-13497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rick P.D. Hubbard G.L. Barr K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kido N. Torgov V.I. Sugiyama T. Uchiya K. Sugihara H. Komatsu T. Kato N. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2178-2187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific mannosyltransferases or galactosyltransferases then extend the und-PP-GlcNAc acceptor (17Clarke B.R. Bronner D. Keenleyside W.J. Severn W.B. Richards J.C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Guan S. Clarke A.J. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3318-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Kido N. Torgov V.I. Sugiyama T. Uchiya K. Sugihara H. Komatsu T. Kato N. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2178-2187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycosyltransferase reactions occur at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane, and once chain extension is complete, the nascent O chain is transferred across the cytoplasmic membrane by an ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter (21Kido N. Torgov V.I. Sugiyama T. Uchiya K. Sugihara H. Komatsu T. Kato N. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2178-2187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bronner D. Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At the periplasmic face of the membrane, theO chain is transferred from the lipid intermediate to preformed lipid A core by the activity of the ligase enzymewaaL to complete the LPS molecule (for review, see Refs. 23Whitfield C. Amor P.A. Koplin R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholarand 24Whitfield C. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 178-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A crucial open question in the biosynthesis of these Ochains is the mechanism(s) by which the chain length is modulated. Examination of LPS molecules isolated from these bacteria shows a typical “modal” (i.e. restricted) distribution ofO-chain lengths. The mechanism of LPS O-chain length determination is crucial for the biology of these organisms because it contributes to resistance to complement-mediated serum killing. The O5kp and O8ec antigens have been reported to contain 3-O-methyl-d-mannose at their non-reducing termini (13Jansson P.E. Lonngren J. Widmalm G. Leontein K. Slettengren K. Svenson S.B. Wrangsell G. Dell A. Tiller P.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 145: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), leading to speculation that terminal structural elements may act as terminating signals for chain extension (24Whitfield C. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 178-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Other serotypes have not been investigated. Recently we have found that polysaccharide O chain can be detached from lipid A of K. pneumoniae LPS by treatment with nitrous acid, which destroys the glycosidic linkage of the α-GlcN residue, present in the core oligosaccharide (25Vinogradov E.V. Cedzynski M. Ziolkowski A. Swierzko A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1722-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The polysaccharides thus obtained were short enough to allow direct structural determination of the end groups by NMR spectroscopy. Here we present data of the analysis of the end groups in the nitrous acid-released O chains fromK. pneumoniae serotypes O1, O2a, O2a,c, O3, O4, O5, and O12. Most of these O chains have non-reducing terminal modifications, suggesting this is a common feature inKlebsiella O antigens. The data also identifies the ligation site for O antigens in the LPS core and shows it to be conserved in different serotypes. K. pneumoniae CWK2 (serotype O1:K20−) has been described elsewhere (9Whitfield C. Richards J.C. Perry M.B. Clarke B.R. MacLean L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1420-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The O-serotype reference strains, O3:K11 (strain 390), O4:K42 (1702), O5:K57 (4425/51), and O12:K80 (708) were provided by Dr. M. Trautmann (Department of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University of Ulm, Germany). Cells of additional serotype O12 strains K. pneumoniae type strain 708 (O12:K80, NRCC 6136), clinical isolate 134/94 (NRCC 6137), clinical isolate KD 420 (NRCC 6138), and clinical isolate 74/94 (NRCC 6139) were obtained from Statens Seruminstitut (Copenhagen, Denmark). LPSs from smooth strains were isolated as described (26Vinogradov E. Perry M.B. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 335: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To isolate LPSs from thewaaL mutant, K. pneumoniae strain CWG399 was grown in a fermenter (10L) in LB for 21h. The cells were then harvested and lyophilized, and the LPS was extracted from dry cells by the phenol/chloroform/light petroleum ether method of Galanoset al. (27Galanos C. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar), with a yield of 5.8% of the bacterial dry mass. To analyze the sequences of thewaaL genes from serotypes O1, O3, O4, O5, and O12, the genes were PCR-amplified from the appropriate strains with primers KPwaa1 (5′-GCGGCCTGGATCCGACCAACT-3′) and KPwaa2 (5′-AGGCGAAGCAGGTACCCTGTGAAGA-3′). The primers were based on the sequence of K. pneumoniae C3 (O1:K66)waaL, available in GenBankTM (accession numberAF146532). The sequences of the waaL genes determined in this work are available in GenBankTM as accession numbersAF482003 (serotype O1, strain CWK2), AF482004 (O3), AF482005 (O4),AF482006 (O5), and AF482007 (O12). The chromosomalwaaL gene in K. pneumoniae CWK2 (O1) was inactivated using a non-polar gentamicin (aacC1) resistance cassette. To construct the waaL::aacC1insertion, portions of the waaL gene and flanking DNA were PCR-amplified from K. pneumoniae CWK2 chromosomal DNA usingPwoI polymerase. The products from primers KPwaa1 and KPwaa12 (5′-AGCATGATATCCACCGGCAGA-3′) and KPwaa14 (5′-TCGCAGGGGATATCTATCATCAG-3′) and KPwaa15 (5′-GGGATATCAGGTACCGGTGTTAAC-3′) were digested withBamHI, EcoRV, and KpnI at sites introduced by the primers (underlined) and ligated to BamHI and KpnI sites in pBCSK+. This produced a construct containing a waaL gene with a 503-bp deletion and an internal EcoRV site. The waaL deletion-derivative gene and flanking DNA was removed on a BamHI andKpnI fragment and ligated to a similarly digested positive-selection suicide delivery vector that is based on pKO3 (28Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The SmaI-digested aacC1 cassette was then ligated into the EcoRV site within waaL. This construct was transferred into CWK2 by electroporation, and allelic exchange was generated a strain that was resistant to gentamicin (aacC1insertion) and sensitive to chloramphenicol (i.e. loss of vector). The resulting mutant was designated CWG399, and the correct insertion was verified by PCR. To confirm that the mutant was only defective in waaL activity, the mutation was complemented using a plasmid carrying waaL. The waaL open reading frame was PCR-amplified using PwoI and primers Kpwaa1 and KPwaa2 (see above). The PCR fragment was ligated to vector pRK404 (29Ditta G. Schmidhauser T. Yakobson E., Lu, P. Liang X.W. Finlay D.R. Guiney D. Helinski D.R. Plasmid. 1985; 13: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) that was prepared by digestion with HindIII and end-filled using Klenow. The resulting plasmid was designated pWQ161. Nucleotide sequences were determined at the Guelph Molecular Supercenter (University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada). For SDS-PAGE analysis, LPS was isolated from proteinase K-digested whole cell lysates (30Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LPS was separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by silver staining and by Western immunoblot with rabbit anti-d-galactan I-specific antibodies (17Clarke B.R. Bronner D. Keenleyside W.J. Severn W.B. Richards J.C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The methods for deamination have been described elsewhere (25Vinogradov E.V. Cedzynski M. Ziolkowski A. Swierzko A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1722-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, LPS (200 mg) was dissolved in water (20 ml). NaNO2 (100 mg) and acetic acid (1 ml) were then added, and after a 6-h incubation at 25 °C, the lipid-containing part of the LPS was removed by ultracentrifugation (120,000 × g, 2h). The supernatant was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G50 (superfine). Polysaccharides were purified on a Hamilton PRP ×100 anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography column in a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl, and the collected peaks were desalted by gel filtration. Chemical shifts obtained by NMR spectroscopy were assigned using two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear experiments at 799.96 MHz for proton and 201.12 MHz for carbon using acetone as reference for proton (2.225 ppm) and 1,4-dioxane for carbon (67.4 ppm). Spectra were recorded at 40 °C in D2O on a Varian UNITY INOVA 800 in 5-mm tubes. The double quantum-filtered phase-sensitive COSY experiment was performed using the Varian standard program tndqcosy, with 0.37-s acquisition time and 4096 data points in the F2 dimension. The data matrix was zero-filled in the F1 dimension to give a matrix of 4096 × 2048 points and was resolution-enhanced in both dimensions by a shifted sine-bell function before Fourier transformation. Similarly, the nuclear Overhauser experiment was performed using the Varian standard tnnoesy, with a mixing time of 100 ms. The total correlation spectroscopy experiment was performed using standard Varian program tntocsy with a spinlock time of 80 ms. The heteronuclear experiments were performed using standard pulse-field gradient programs gHSQC, gHSQCTOCSY, and gHMBC. The spectra were assigned using the computer program Pronto (31Kjaer M. Andersen K.V. Poulsen F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 288-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were recorded by electrospray ionization Fourier transform-ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS) utilizing an Apex II with a 7-Tesla super-conducting magnet (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). GLC, GLC-mass spectroscopy, methylation, and monosaccharide analyses were performed as previously described (32Unger F.M. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1981; 38: 323-388Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). O-Deacylated LPSs were prepared by treatment of the LPS with anhydrous hydrazine (1 ml for 50 mg of LPS, 40 °C, 1 h). After treatment, the samples were diluted with water and dialyzed. LPSs from K. pneumoniae serotypes O1, O2a, O2a,c, O3, O4, O5, and O12 were treated with NaNO2/acetic acid, and the lipid A-containing part was removed by ultracentifugation. The soluble products were fractionated by gel and anion exchange chromatography to give polysaccharide fractions in addition to the two previously described (25Vinogradov E.V. Cedzynski M. Ziolkowski A. Swierzko A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1722-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) oligosaccharides 1 and 2, originating fromO-chain-deficient LPS molecules. The polysaccharide fractions were eluted from gel filtration chromatography as one or two peaks of different molecular mass, and the lower mass fractions were used for structural analysis. The polysaccharides were passed through an anion exchange column in water, and the void volume fractions were used in further studies; this treatment significantly improved the quality of NMR spectra, removing background signals derived from contaminants. The monosaccharide analysis (GLC of alditol acetates) of the polysaccharides (data not shown) revealed the presence of the expected repeating unit monosaccharides (Fig. 2) and of glucosamine andl-glycero-d-manno-heptose in quantities about 20 times less than those of the repeating unit components. Monosaccharide analysis of the polysaccharide from serotype O5kp also revealed small amount of 3-O-methylmannose, which was previously reported to be present at the non-reducing end of the polymeric chain (13Jansson P.E. Lonngren J. Widmalm G. Leontein K. Slettengren K. Svenson S.B. Wrangsell G. Dell A. Tiller P.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 145: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 33Lindberg B. Lonngren J. Nimmich W. Acta Chem. Scand. 1972; 26: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GLC analysis of the acetylated products of acid methanolysis of all polysaccharides showed the presence of Kdo. The polysaccharides were reduced with NaBH4 and methylated, after which the methylated products were hydrolyzed and converted to partially methylated 1d-alditol acetates. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis led to the identification of the major products derived from repeating units (Fig. 2) and a number of small peaks of the intensity about 20-fold less than major products. Among these minor products, 1,3,4-tri-O-methyl-6-O-acetyl-2,5-anhydromannitol, 2,3,4,6,7-penta-O-methyl-1,5-di-O-acetyl-1d-heptitol, and 2-(N-methylacetamido)-2-deoxy-4,6-di-O-methyl-1,3,5-tri-O-acetyl-1d-glucitol were identified in all strains. These derivatives originated from the monosaccharide residues M, P, and F at the reducing terminus. In serotype O12, the derivative of 3-substituted GlcNAc was present in a large proportion because it is also a component of the repeating unit (34Erbing C. Lindberg B. Lonngren J. Carbohydr. Res. 1977; 56: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Methylation of the polysaccharides from serotypes O1, O2a, and O2a,c gave minor amounts of the derivatives of non-substituted galactofuranose. Methylation of the polysaccharide from serotype O12 showed the presence of minor amounts of non-substituted and 3-substituted rhamnopyranose. The methylated products obtained from strain O5 contained 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-1,5-di-O-acetyl-1d-mannitol. The NMR spectra of all polymers contained, in addition to the signals of the components of repeating units, clearly visible signals of the residues of Kdo and anomeric signals of Hep P and of the hydrated aldehyde group of 2,5-anhydromannose (2,5-anhMan) (Figs. 3 and 4). The spectra were interpreted using two-dimensional techniques, and most of the proton and carbon signals of repeating unit monosaccharides were assigned. The signals of terminal regions were well visible on the correlation spectra (Fig.5) but could be only partially assigned because of low signal intensities and overlap problems. Nevertheless,1H and 13C NMR signals for atoms 1–5 were found in most cases (Tables Table I, Table II, Table III, Table IV, Table V, Table VI, Table VII, Table VIII), and interglycoside NOE and HMBC correlations were identified. These data were sufficient for the identification of the constituent monosaccharides and for sequence determination of the repeating unit and terminal regions of the polymers. Monosaccharides were identified on the basis of vicinal coupling constants and chemical shifts of the signals, and their connectivity was identified from NOE and HMBC data. Interglycoside NOE correlations between H-1 and transglycosidic proton as well as adjacent protons were observed. HMBC spectra contained correlations from H-1 to the transglycosidic carbon atom, indicating linkage position, and contained useful information for the signal assignment of intraresidual correlations in α-pyranoses to C-2 (weak) and C-3 and C-5 (strong) and for β-pyranose correlations to C-2 and C-3. For Kdo residues, HMBC correlations from H-3 to its own C-2 and from C-2 to transglycosidic carbon atom were identified.Figure 41 H NMR spectra of the polysaccharides, obtained from K. pneumoniaeserotypes O3 and O5.

https://openalex.org/W1530759554,"Infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) can lead to the development of cervical carcinomas. This process critically depends on the virus-encoded E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which stimulate proliferation by manipulating the function of a variety of host key regulatory proteins. Here we show that both viral proteins dose-dependently interfere with the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. A variety of experimental approaches revealed that a fraction of the E7 proteins is found in association with the IκB kinase complex and attenuates induced kinase activity of IκB kinase α (IKKα) and IKKβ, thus resulting in impaired IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. Indirect immunofluorescence shows that E7 impairs TNFα-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB, thus preventing NF-κB from binding to its cognate DNA. While E7 obviates IKK activation in the cytoplasm, the E6 protein reduces NF-κB p65-dependent transcriptional activity within the nucleus. We suggest that HPV oncogene-mediated suppression of NF-κB activity contributes to HPV escape from the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2163785860,"Calcium mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into the cytosol is a key component of several signaling networks controlling tumor cell growth, differentiation, or apoptosis. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPases (SERCA-type calcium pumps), enzymes that accumulate calcium in the ER, play an important role in these phenomena. We report that SERCA3 expression is significantly reduced or lost in colon carcinomas when compared with normal colonic epithelial cells, which express this enzyme at a high level. To study the involvement of SERCA enzymes in differentiation, in this work differentiation of colon and gastric cancer cell lines was initiated, and the change in the expression of SERCA isoenzymes as well as intracellular calcium levels were investigated. Treatment of the tumor cells with butyrate or other established differentiation inducing agents resulted in a marked and specific induction of the expression of SERCA3, whereas the expression of the ubiquitous SERCA2 enzymes did not change significantly or was reduced. A similar marked increase in SERCA3 expression was found during spontaneous differentiation of post-confluent Caco-2 cells, and this closely correlated with the induction of other known markers of differentiation. Analysis of the expression of the SERCA3 alternative splice isoforms revealed induction of all three known iso-SERCA3 variants (3a, 3b, and 3c). Butyrate treatment of the KATO-III gastric cancer cells led to higher resting cytosolic calcium concentrations and, in accordance with the lower calcium affinity of SERCA3, to diminished ER calcium content. These data taken together indicate a defect in SERCA3 expression in colon cancers as compared with normal colonic epithelium, show that the calcium homeostasis of the endoplasmic reticulum may be remodeled during cellular differentiation, and indicate that SERCA3 constitutes an interesting new differentiation marker that may prove useful for the analysis of the phenotype of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2135146520,"We analyzed the formation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in individual muscles of the mouse embryo. Skeletal muscles can be assigned to one of two distinct classes of muscles, termed “Fast Synapsing” (FaSyn) and “Delayed Synapsing” (DeSyn) muscles, which differ significantly with respect to the initial focal clustering of postsynaptic AChRs, the timing of presynaptic maturation, and the maintenance of NMJs in young adult mice. Differences between classes were intrinsic to the muscles and manifested in the absence of innervation or agrin. Paralysis or denervation of young adult muscles resulted in disassembly of AChR clusters on DeSyn muscles, whereas those on FaSyn muscles were preserved. Our results show that postsynaptic differentiation processes intrinsic to FaSyn and DeSyn muscles influence the formation of NMJs during development and their maintenance in the adult."
https://openalex.org/W2046554880,"The estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. We show that the major isoform of the human ERRα gene, ERRα1, can sequence-specifically bind a consensus palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) and directly compete with estrogen receptor α (ERα) for binding. ERRα1 activates or represses ERE-regulated transcription in a cell type-dependent manner, repressing in ER-positive MCF-7 cells while activating in ER-negative HeLa cells. Thus, ERRα1 can function both as a modulator of estrogen responsiveness and as an estrogen-independent activator. Repression likely occurs in the absence of exogenous ligand since charcoal treatment of the serum had no effect on silencing activity. Mutational analysis revealed that repression is not simply the result of competition between ERα and ERRα1 for binding to the DNA. Rather, it also requires the presence of sequences within the carboxyl-terminal E/F domain of ERRα1. Thus, ERRα1 can function as either an active repressor or a constitutive activator of ERE-dependent transcription. We hypothesize that ERRα1 can play a critical role in the etiology of some breast cancers, thereby providing a novel therapeutic target in their treatment.

The amino-terminal A/B domain can function as a hormone-independent activator of transcription. The highly conserved C domain contains the DNA binding domain (DBD) that confers sequence-specific DNA binding activity. A hinge region, called the D domain, bridges the C domain with the carboxyl-terminal E/F domain that includes the receptor-specific ligand binding domain (LBD) of the protein. The binding of appropriate ligands results in conformation changes leading to alterations in the transcriptional properties of the receptor, including the exposure of a transcriptional activation region within the carboxyl end. Although many nuclear receptor superfamily members bind known ligands (e.g., steroids, retinoids, thyroid hormones), some, termed orphan receptors, share significant sequence similarity in their LBDs with their ligand binding family members but lack as-yet known naturally occurring ligands (7Enmark E.

Among the first orphan receptors identified were the estrogen-related receptors ERRα and ERRβ (officially named NR3B1 and NR3B2, respectively) (10Giguère V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). They were cloned by low stringency screening of cDNA libraries with probes corresponding to the DBD of estrogen receptor α (ERα) (10Giguère V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Subsequently, ERRα1 was identified as the major isoform present in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 A) (11Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F.

Despite sequence similarity with ERs in the LBD, the ERRs do not bind 17β-estradiol (11Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol.

(17Vanacker J., M. Bonnelye E. Chopin-Delannoy S. Delmarre C. Cavailles V. Laudet V. Mol.

However, remaining unclear is whether this factor(s) acts directly by binding to ERRα or indirectly through a signal transduction pathway. Yang and Chen (18Yang C. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4519-4524PubMed Google Scholar) found that the pesticides toxaphene and chlordane decrease the activity of ERRα, whereas others reported that ERRs can constitutively interact with co-activators independent of any ligand (19Xie W.

Chopin-Delannoy S. Delmarre C. Cavailles V. Laudet V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 764-773PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, some genes likely contain estrogen-related receptor response elements regulated only by ERR family members. Thus, ERR family members likely signal via cross-talk with other nuclear receptors through common binding sites as well as ERR-specific genes via ERR-binding sites. The ERR family members have been shown to function in numerous cell types as transcriptional activators of promoters containing EREs, steroidogenic factor-1 response elements, and ER response elements (16–31). Nevertheless, we found that ERRα1 repressed rather than activated transcription in ER-negative CV-1 cells when it binds sites within the late promoter of SV40 (11Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 32Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Zuo F. Murray E.E. Loritz K. Mertz J.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2206-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, ERRs likely modulate gene expression via several mechanisms. To better understand the multiple activities of ERRα1, we investigated here the effects of ERRα1 on expression from an ERE-regulated promoter in ER-positive versus ER-negative cells. We show that ERRα1 can function as either a repressor or activator of ERE-mediated transcription in a cell type-dependent manner. The mechanism of repression involves interactions with cellular corepressor(s) as well as binding to the ERE. We propose ERRα1 likely plays roles in the etiology of some breast cancers and the progression from an ER-dependent to ER-independent state. All plasmid DNAs were constructed by standard recombinant DNA techniques. Plasmid p3xERE-TK-luc, a gift from V. C. Jordan, contains three tandem copies of the palindromic ERE sequence 5′-TAAGCTTAGGTCACAGTGACCTAAGCTTA-3′, placed upstream of a minimal herpes simplex thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (nucleotides –109 to +52 relative to the transcriptional start site of the TK promoter), directing expression of the luciferase coding sequence (33Catherino W.H. Jordan V.C. Cancer Lett. 1995; 92: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ERE-negative control plasmid, pTK-luc, was generated from p3xERE-TK-luc by cleavage at the two HindIII sites directly surrounding the three EREs and ligation. Plasmid pcDNA3.1-hERRα1 encodes wild-type human ERRα1 expressed from the cytomegalovirus promoter. It was constructed by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of hERRα1 mRNA isolated from normal human mammary gland RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) followed by PCR-based cloning of the coding region into pcDNA3.1/V5-His (Invitrogen). To ensure efficient initiation and termination of translation of the ERRα open reading frame, the cloning was performed using the primers 5′-gacttcGCCACCATG AGCAGCCAGGTGGTGGTGCATTGA-3′ (lowercase letters indicate an EcoRI site, underlined letters indicate the translation initiation codon, and bold letters indicate bases altered to optimize translation initiation while maintaining coding of the wild-type ERRα1 protein) and 5′-ggatccTCAGTCCATCATGGCCTCGAGCAt-3′ (lowercase letters indicate a BamHI site, and underlined letters indicate the translation termination codon). DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the protein encoded by this plasmid corresponds to the wild-type ERRα1 referenced in GenBankTM entry NM-004451. Plasmids pcDNA3.1-hERRα11–173, pcDNA3.1-hERRα176–423, pcDNA3.1-hERRα1L413A/L418A, and pcDNA3.1-hERRα1P-box encode mutant variants of ERRα1 (Fig. 1 B). They were constructed by PCR-based methods with pcDNA3.1-hERRα1 as the starting template. For pcDNA3.1-hERRα11–173 and pcDNA3.1-hERRα1L413A/L418A, the primers used for the termination codon-containing plasmids were, respectively, 5′-ggatccTCACGGGAAGGGCAGTGGGTCCA-3′ and 5′-ggatccTCAGTCCATCATGGCCTCGGCCATCTCCAAGAACGCCTTGTGCATGGGCACCTTGC-3′ (bold letters indicate bases altered to change leucine codons to alanine). Likewise, pcDNA3.1-hERRα176–423 was constructed using 5′-gaattcGCCACCATGAAGCGCCTCTGCCTGGTCT-3′ for the initiation codon-containing primer. Plasmid pcDNA3.1-hERRα1P-box contains three amino acid substitution mutations (E97G/A98S/A101V) within the predicted P-box of the ERRα1 DNA binding domain that abrogate the ability of the protein to bind DNA. It was constructed by PCR amplification of the open reading frame of ERRα1 in two directly abutting fragments corresponding to the amino and carboxyl termini of the protein. The ERRα1P-box amino-terminal fragment was amplified using as primers the wild-type translation initiation codon-containing primer and 5′-phosphate-GGACCCACAGGATGCCACACCATAGTGGTA-3′. The ERRα1P-box carboxyl-terminal fragment was amplified using as primers the wild-type translation termination codon-containing primer and 5′-phosphate-TGCAAAGTCTTCTTCAAGAGGACCATCCA-3′. The resulting PCR products were digested with EcoRI and BamHI, respectively, ligated together, and re-amplified using the wild-type initiation and termination codon-containing primers to produce the full-length ERRα1P-box mutant. The ER-positive, human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 6 ng of insulin/ml, 3 μg of glutamine/ml, and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin/ml. The ER-negative, human cervical HeLa cell line and the monkey kidney COS-M6 cell line were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units of penicillin and streptomycin/ml. When cells were cultured in estrogen-free medium, referred to here as stripped medium, dextran-coated charcoal-treated FBS (34Katzenellenbogen J.A. Johnson H.J., Jr. Meyers H.N. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4085-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) replaced whole FBS and phenol red-free RPMI 1640 replaced RPMI 1640. To assess the role ERRα1 plays in regulating transcription of an ERE-containing promoter, MCF-7 or HeLa cells grown in 12-well tissue culture plates were co-transfected in parallel with 0.5 μg of pTK-lucversus p3xERE-TK-luc along with the indicated amounts of the empty cloning vector pcDNA3.1, the ERRα1 expression plasmid pcDNA3.1-hERRα1, or mutant variants thereof. Transfections were performed with the aid of the TransIT LT1 transfection reagent (PanVera, Madison, WI) as previously described (35Kraus R.J. Shadley L. Mertz J.E. Virology. 2001; 287: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of ER ligands, cells were maintained in stripped medium for 48 h before transfection and the addition of 17β-estradiol (E2) (Sigma) or the pure anti-estrogen ICI-182,780 (Astra Zeneca, London, UK) dissolved in ethanol and diluted in medium to obtain the indicated concentrations. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and lysates were assayed for luciferase activity normalized to protein concentration as previously described (36Kraus R.J. Mirocha S.J. Stephany H.M. Puchalski J.R. Mertz J.E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed essentially as described by Reese et al. (37Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6595-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using whole-cell extracts prepared as described previously (35Kraus R.J. Shadley L. Mertz J.E. Virology. 2001; 287: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole-cell extracts obtained from five 10-mm dishes of COS-M6 cells that had been transfected 48 h previously with 3 μg/dish of the desired expression plasmid served as the source of NRs. Transfections were performed with the aid of the TransIT LT1 transfection reagent as previously described (35Kraus R.J. Shadley L. Mertz J.E. Virology. 2001; 287: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-TAAGCTTAGGTCACAGTGACCTAAGCTTA-3′ served as the ERE probe. One to five μl of extract (10–100 μg of protein) was preincubated on ice for 20 min in a 16-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 3 μg of BSA, and 4 μg of poly(dI-dC). Radiolabeled probe (∼1.0 ng) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were loaded directly onto a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA as running buffer and electrophoresed at 200 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoshift assays were performed by the addition of the indicated antiserum at the preincubation step. The ERα-specific antiserum was the monoclonal antibody H222 (kindly provided by Dr. Geoffrey Greene). The hERRα1-specific antiserum was the previously described polyclonal one raised in rabbits against glutathioneS-transferase GST-hERRα117–329 (11Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To determine whether the NRs were efficiently and correctly expressed, 5–10 μg of whole-cell extract containing the overexpressed NR were resolved by SDS, 12% PAGE. The proteins in the gel were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against GST-hERRα1 (11Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) followed by anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase (1:1000 dilution). The retained antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Johnston et al. (11Johnston S.D. Liu X. Zuo F. Eisenbraun T.L. Wiley S.R. Kraus R.J. Mertz J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and others (12Shigeta H. Zuo W. Yang N. DiAugustine R. Teng C.T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) showed previously that ERRα1 can bind to some naturally occurring EREs. To test whether ERRα1 recognizes the palindromic ERE sequence, 5′-TAAGCTTAGGTCACAGTGACCTAAGCTTA-3′, EMSAs were performed using whole-cell extracts obtained from COS-M6 cells that contained overexpressed ERα or ERRα1 as protein source and a radiolabeled, double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide that contained the palindromic ERE sequence as probe. As expected, both ERα and ERRα1 bound to this synthetic ERE (Fig.2 A). ERα generated a protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) that was immunoshifted with the ERα-specific antibody H222 (Fig.2 A, lane 3) but not with the ERRα1-specific antiserum (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). ERRα1 also bound the ERE, generating a single protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2 A,lane 5) that migrated faster than the ERα-DNA complex (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 versus 2) and was immunoshifted with the ERRα1-specific antibody (Fig.2 A, lane 7) but not with the ERα-specific antiserum (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). Thus, both ERα and ERRα1 can bind this palindromic sequence. To determine whether the binding of ERRα1 and ERα to this ERE is mutually exclusive, cooperative, or competitive, EMSAs were performed with a constant amount of ERα plus various amounts of ERRα1 mixed together in the same binding reaction. The addition of increasing amounts of ERRα1 yielded an increase in the amount of ERRα1-DNA complex along with a corresponding decrease in the amount of ERα-DNA complex (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–6). Similar results were obtained when this competition experiment was performed with extracts of COS-M6 cells that had been co-transfected with various molar ratios of the ERα- and ERRα-expressing plasmids (data not shown). Thus, the binding of ERRα1 and ERα to this palindromic ERE is mutually exclusive, with ERRα1 effectively competing with ERα for binding when present in sufficient amounts. Because ERRα1 can interfere with the binding of ERα to this ERE, might it affect estrogen-responsive transcription? To answer this question, we co-transfected ER-positive mammary MCF-7 cells in parallel with p3xERE-TK-luc, a reporter plasmid containing three tandem copies of this ERE (Fig. 3 A) or the ERE-negative control plasmid, pTK-luc, together with 0.12 or 0.25 μg of the ERRα1 expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1-hERRα1, or the empty parental expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1. After incubation for 48 h in medium containing whole FBS, the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. The presence of the EREs conferred an ∼150-fold increase in transcriptional activity above the level observed in the cells transfected with the ERE-negative reporter plasmid (Fig. 3 B). This ERE-dependent activity was extremely sensitive to treatment with the anti-estrogen ICI-182,780, indicating the activation is dependent upon ER and the presence of estrogens in the FBS (Fig. 3 B). Overexpression of ERRα1 repressed this ERE-dependent transcriptional activity ∼3–4-fold (Fig. 3 B; see also Fig. 7 B) while exhibiting little if any effect on expression of the control pTK-luc reporter plasmid (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, ERRα1 inhibits the estrogen-responsive activation of transcription from this ERE-containing promoter in this ER-positive MCF-7 cell line.Figure 7ERR α1 represses transcription by an active silencing mechanism. MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of (A) pTK-luc or (B) p3xERE-TK-luc and 0.12 μg or 0.25 μg of the empty vector pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-hERRα1, pcDNA3.1-hERRα11–173, pcDNA3.1-hERRα176–423, pcDNA3.1-hERRα1413A/418A, or pcDNA3.1- hERRα1P-box. After incubation for 48 h in medium containing whole FBS, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined with normalization to the protein concentration of each extract. The data are presented in panel A relative to the activity observed with pTK-luc plus 0.12 μg of pcDNA3.1; they are presented in panel B relative to the activity observed with p3xERE-TK-luc plus 0.12 μg pcDNA3.1. All data shown represent means plus the S.E. from three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To directly examine the effect of ERRα1 on the response to estrogen, MCF-7 cells were cultured in medium containing estrogen-free charcoal-stripped FBS and cotransfected as described above but in the absence or presence of E2. In the absence of exogenous E2, p3xERE-TK-luc was expressed at an ∼50-fold higher level than pTK-luc, activity that was largely ablated by treatment with the anti-estrogen ICI-182,780 (Fig.4 A). Once again, overexpression of ERRα1 repressed ERE-dependent transcription ∼3-fold while having little if any effect on transcription of the control reporter (Fig. 4 A). The addition of 1 × 10−10mE2, a physiological concentration, to the medium dramatically induced transcriptional activity of the ERE-containing reporter plasmid ∼10-fold above the level observed in the absence of exogenous E2 (Fig. 4, B versus A). Consistent with this induction being mediated by ER, it was completely eliminated by incubation of the cells with the anti-estrogen ICI-182,780 (Fig. 4 B). Strikingly, overexpression of ERRα1 inhibited this E2-mediated activation of transcription from the ERE-containing promoter 3–5-fold, while, again, having little if any affect on expression of the ERE-negative control, pTK-luc (Fig. 4 B). Lastly, when the co-transfected cells were incubated with 1 × 10−8m E2, a non-physiological concentration, ERE-dependent transcription was stimulated an additional 3-fold over the level of activity observed with 10−10m E2 to a level ∼30-fold above the activity observed in the absence of exogenous E2(Fig. 4 C). Again, this activity was extremely sensitive to treatment with the anti-estrogen ICI-182,780 (Fig. 4 C), consistent with high concentrations of E2 generating high levels of liganded, active ER. However, overexpression of ERRα1 no longer inhibited this E2-mediated activation of transcription from p3x ERE-TK-luc (Fig. 4 C). Thus, we conclude that ERRα1 can modulate estrogen responsiveness when its concentration relative to E2-occupied ERα is sufficient to allow effective competition for binding to the ERE. What is the mechanism by which ERRα1 inhibits ER-mediated transcriptional activation? One possibility is that it simply competes with ERα for mutually exclusive binding to EREs, thereby blocking binding of the transcriptional activator. Alternatively, ERRα1 may contain a regulatory domain(s) as well as a DNA binding domain that plays an active role in modulating transcription from ERE-containing promoters. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we constructed several variants of pcDNA3.1-hERRα1 (Fig. 1 B) and determined their DNA binding and transcriptional activities. Plasmid pcDNA3.1-hERRα11–173 encodes a carboxyl-terminal-deleted variant of full-length ERRα1 that retains the amino-terminal A/B and DNA binding domains but lacks the E/F domains. Thus, ERRα11–173 is unable to bind putative ligands, ligand-dependent coactivator complexes, and, possibly, corepressor complexes. Immunoblotting with an antiserum specific for ERRα1 indicated that ERRα11–173 was expressed at levels comparable with, if not higher than full-length ERRα1 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4 versus 2). EMSAs indicated that ERRα11–173 forms a protein-DNA complex with the palindromic ERE (Fig. 5 B, lane 5) that can be immunoshifted with the ERRα1-specific antiserum (Fig. 5 B,lane 6). Most importantly, ERRα11–173efficiently competed for binding to this ERE with both ERα (Fig.6 A, lanes 4–6) and full-length ERRα1 (Fig. 6 B, lanes 4–5). Therefore, synthesis of ERRα11–173 in MCF-7 cells would also be predicted to result in inhibition of ER-mediated transcription if repression were caused simply by passive binding of ERRα1 to the ERE. However, contrary to the result observed with full-length ERRα1 (Figs. 3 B and 7 B), overexpression of ERRα11–173 failed to repress transcription of either pTK-luc (Fig. 7 A) or p3xERE-TK-luc (Fig. 7 B); rather, it slightly enhanced transcription of p3xERE-TK-luc (Fig. 7 B).Figure 6Competition between ERR α1 variants and ERα or ERR α1 for binding to the palindromic ERE. A, ERRα11–173, but not ERRα1P-box, competes with ERα for binding to the ERE. The radiolabeled ERE probe was incubated with a constant amount of whole-cell extract expressing ERα alone (lane 2) or together with increasing amounts of whole-cell extract containing overexpressed ERRα11–173 (lanes 4–6) or ERRα1P-box (lanes 7–9).

The dermal-epidermal junction is a highly specialized basement membrane zone, which ensures the adhesion of the epidermis and the dermis in the skin. It contains distinct multicomponent aggregates (i.e.hemidesmosomes, anchoring filaments, and anchoring fibrils), which interact with each other to provide a tight linkage of the skin layers, and to mediate cross-talk between the epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts (26Burgeson R.E. Christiano A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Collagen VII is a major protein of this zone and the main structural component of the anchoring fibrils. Keratinocytes synthesize and secrete it into the extracellular space as a precursor, procollagen VII; during fibril polymerization, a C-terminal propeptide is proteolytically released (27Morris N.P.

Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In normal human skin, the C-propeptide is completely removed and is not found at the dermal-epidermal junction. However, in dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), a genetic disease caused by mutations of collagen VII (30Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1999; 20: 122-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Bruckner-Tuderman L. Höpfner B. Hammami-Hauasli N. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), procollagen can be retained in the skin of the patient, implying that deficient C-propeptide processing is associated with functional abnormalities of the anchoring fibrils (32Bruckner-Tuderman L. Nilssen O. Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Kalinke D.U. Gedde-Dahl T., Jr. Winberg J.O. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The importance of the NC-2 domain for antiparallel dimer formation was recently demonstrated by Chen et al. (33Chen M. Keene D.R. Costa F.K. Tahk S.H. Woodley D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21649-21655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, so far, the mechanisms of fibrillogenesis of the anchoring fibrils, including the propeptide cleavage site and the enzyme(s) involved, have remained elusive. Two lines of evidence point to BMP-1 as the candidate enzyme for the processing of procollagen VII. First, the NC-2 domain of procollagen VII contains a BMP-1 consensus sequence motif (8Scott I.C. Imamura Y. Pappano W.N. Troedel J.M. Recklies A.D. Roughley P.J. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol.

Champliaud M.F. Rest M. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), is processed by BMP-1 (9Amano S. Scott I.C. Takahara K. Koch M. Champliaud M.F. Gerecke D.R. Keene D.R. Hudson D.L. Nishiyama T. Lee S. Greenspan D.S. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 314: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The proteolytic cleavage of laminin 5 α3 and γ2 chains is believed to regulate the interactions between the laminin molecule and its ligands, integrin α6β4, laminin 6, and collagen VII. The cleavage of the γ2 chain drives deposition of laminin 5 into the extracellular matrix and sustains cell adhesion (10Gagnoux-Palacios L. Allegra M. Spirito F. Pommeret O. Romero C. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In concert, malignant cells with high migratory activity do not process laminin 5 completely (37Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), and in a cylindroma tumor model, abnormal processing of both chains was associated with striking structural abnormalities of the basement membrane (38Tunggal L.

The above observations argue for the functional importance of proteolytic processing of the epidermal adhesion partners laminin 5 and collagen VII. Here we show that the same enzyme(s) is/are responsible for the cleavage of both counterparts and postulate that the cleavage of the keratinocyte-derived laminin 5 and procollagen VII by fibroblast-derived enzyme(s) presents a mechanism of regulation of the assembly of the dermal-epidermal junction and an intriguing manifestation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Primary human keratinocytes and HaCaT cells (kindly provided by Norbert E. Fusenig, DKFZ Heidelberg, Germany) were cultured in keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract and 5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen) as described (39König A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar). Primary human skin fibroblasts were grown from skin explants as described (39König A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to protein analyses, the cells were transferred to a medium without supplements and were grown in the presence of 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid for 48 h. For extraction of procollagen VII, the cell layers were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted as described previously (40Hammami-Hauasli N. Schumann H. Raghunath M. Kilgus O.

Extraction of proteins from normal or DEB human skin biopsies and normal or Bmp1 −/− mouse embryo skin (41Suzuki N. Labosky P.A. Furuta Y. Hargett L. Dunn R. Fogo A.B. Takahara K. Peters D.M. Greenspan D.S. Hogan B.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed as described (42König A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutated procollagen VII was isolated from cultured keratinocytes of two DEB patients with the methods described above. COL7A1 mutation analysis was performed with PCR amplification of all 118 COL7A1 exons directly from genomic DNA of the patients, followed by heteroduplex analysis and dideoxynucleotide sequencing, as described previously (40Hammami-Hauasli N.

Both patients carried the deletion mutation 8523del14 on one allele of the COL7A1 gene (32Bruckner-Tuderman L. Nilssen O. Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Kalinke D.U. Gedde-Dahl T., Jr. Winberg J.O. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 43Betts C.M. Posteraro P. Costa A.M. Varotti C. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Castiglia D. Br. J. Dermatol. 1999; 141: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mutation leads to in-frame skipping of exon 115, which encodes a sequence of 29 amino acids containing the BMP-1 cleavage site. On the other allele, patient 1 carried the known nonsense mutation A425G (44Gardella R. Belletti L. Zoppi N. Marini D. Barlati S. Colombi M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 292-300PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, patient 1 was functionally homozygous for the deletion,i.e. synthesized only homotrimers consisting of deleted proα(VII) chains. Patient 2 had a glycine substitution mutation G2009R on the other allele and was thus compound heterozygous for two different mutations (32Bruckner-Tuderman L. Nilssen O. Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Kalinke D.U. Gedde-Dahl T., Jr. Winberg J.O. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE analysis, proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid in the presence of deoxycholic acid (45Arnold U. Ulbrich-Hofmann R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 271: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out using standard techniques. The domain-specific collagen VII antibodies are as follows: NC1-F3 to the NC-1 domain, 3S. Mecklenbeck, H. S. Compton, J. E. Mejı́a, R. Cervini, A. Hovnanian, and L. Bruckner-Tuderman, submitted for publication.VII-aff against the triple-helical domain (46Bruckner-Tuderman L. Schnyder U.W. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and NC2-7 and NC2-10 against the NC-2 domain of procollagen VII (32Bruckner-Tuderman L. Nilssen O. Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Kalinke D.U. Gedde-Dahl T., Jr. Winberg J.O. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The antibody NC2-7 recognizes epitopes within the propeptide, and therewith only procollagen VII but not mature collagen VII. The secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). The signals were detected with the Renaissance chemiluminescence substrate from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. One μg of total RNA from cultured human foreskin keratinocytes was reverse-transcribed, and PCR was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Herculase Enhanced DNA Polymerase, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following fragments of human collagen VII cDNAs were generated and linked together by overlapping PCR: human collagen VII (NM_000094), nucleotides 3237–3965 and 8163–8945. The PCR product was subcloned (Rapid DNA Ligation Kit; Roche Diagnostics) into the episomal expression vector pCEP-Pu/BM40 (47Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Ernst Pöschl, University of Erlangen, Germany). For convenience, an octa-His tag followed by a stop codon was introduced at the 3′ end, adjacent to the BamHI site of the vector. TOP 10 cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the vector. Plasmids were isolated from the bacteria (Qiaprep, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced with gene-specific primers (Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit; U. S. Biochemical Corp.). 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were transfected (FuGENE, Roche Diagnostics) with the expression vector and selected after 2 days with puromycin (Sigma). Transfected 293-EBNA cells were subcloned, and the clones with the highest protein production were chosen for large scale production. The cells were cultured in the presence of puromycin and of 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid for hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues within the triple-helical domain. Two liters of supernatant from these cells were collected and supplemented with 0.5 mm Pefabloc (AEBSF, Merck). After ammonium sulfate precipitation (45% saturation), the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and then dialyzed against binding buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8). The dialyzed protein was applied onto a nickel-chelated Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences AB) and eluted with binding buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (10–80 mm imidazole). The protein was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Rotary shadowing of the recombinant truncated collagen VII molecules was performed as published previously (35Rousselle P. Keene D.R. Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.F. Rest M. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). For assessment of the domain structure of the recombinant truncated procollagen VII, 100 μg of protein (concentration: 1 mg/ml) was subjected to treatment with collagenase or pepsin as described (48Schäcke H. Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Raghunath M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25937-25943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For deglycosylation, the protein was dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 20 mmEDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and subsequently reduced with 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 60 °C prior to digestion with 5 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) for 18 h at 37 °C. Recombinant human BMP-1, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 were prepared as described (18Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 36Sasaki T. Göhring W. Mann K. Brakebusch C. Yamada Y. Fässler R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); mTLL-1 and mTLL-2 carried a FLAG tag. The digestions with 400 ng of enzyme were performed in 100–200 μl of a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm AEBSF for 24 h at 37 °C, unless otherwise stated. When recombinant truncated procollagen was used as a substrate, 5 μg of the protein were incubated with the respective protease in the presence of 1 mm AEBSF (Merck), 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Reactions were stopped by precipitation of proteins by trichloroacetic acid in the presence of deoxycholic acid, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. When procollagen VII from cell extracts was used as a substrate, the extracts were concentrated by precipitation with 176 mg/ml ammonium sulfate, and the protein precipitate was harvested by centrifugation for 1 h at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm. The protein pellet was resuspended in 400 μl/75 cm2 of the above assay buffer and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight. After dialysis, protease inhibitors were added, and the sample was incubated in the presence of BMP-1 as described above. Protein precipitation and analysis were carried out as mentioned above. After cleavage of the truncated procollagen VII with BMP-1, mTLL-1, or mTLL-2, the cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to high capacity protein-binding membrane (Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Bio-Rad). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the band corresponding to the C-propeptide was excised and subjected to N-terminal microsequencing using Edman degradation (Toplab, Martinsried, Germany, and Microsequencing Facility of the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston). Media were obtained from primary human keratinocytes and fibroblasts as described above. 94 μl of medium were each incubated with 1 μg ofl-Pro-14C-human procollagen I for 8 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% (w/v) dextran sulfate, 0.01% (w/v) Brij-35, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide (49Hojima Y. Behta B. Romanic A.M. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Incubation of radioactively labeled procollagen I in the absence of cell culture medium served as a negative control, and incubation in the presence of recombinant human BMP-1 served as a positive control, respectively. Samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by blotting and exposure to film. Collagen VII was detected using the polyclonal antibody NC1-F3 that recognizes the NC-1 domain of collagen VII.3 The monoclonal antibody “2H1” directed against mTLL-1 was a kind gift from Paul Findell and Suzanne Spong, FibroGen Inc., South San Francisco, CA. The polyclonal antibodies “AB81032” directed against the N terminus of BMP-1/mTLD and “AB81030” against the C terminus of mTLD were purchased from Chemicon, Temecula, CA. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit/anti-mouse antibodies were from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Cells were cultured on coverslips in the presence of 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid for 48 h, permeabilized, and fixed with absolute methanol at −20 °C. For immunofluorescence staining, cells and tissue cryosections were incubated at room temperature with the first antibody overnight and the second antibody for 1 h. Preparations were mounted with Mowiol (Hoechst, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) and examined using a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop 2, equipped with either an MC 80 DX camera or an AxioCam HRc digital camera, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at a wavelength of 488 nm. For immunoperoxidase staining, the specimens were incubated with the primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin overnight at room temperature followed by incubation with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (EnVision, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min at room temperature. Peroxidase activity was visualized using chromogenic 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) in 50 mm acetic acid/sodium acetate, pH 4.7, in the presence of H2O2 at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were counterstained with Mayer′s hemalum solution (Merck) and washed with water. The slides were mounted with Gurr Aquamount (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, UK) and analyzed by light microscopy. Preliminary experiments with BMP-1 purified from osteosarcoma cell lines indicated that BMP-1 was able to cleave procollagen VII isolated from cultured human keratinocytes. However, only minute amounts of the released C-propeptide were retrieved after the cleavage, impeding the determination of the cleavage site. Therefore, a recombinant truncated procollagen VII was produced for characterization of the BMP-1 processing of procollagen VII and for determination of the cleaved peptide bond. The cDNA construct encoded a fusion product of procollagen VII amino acids 1042–1284 to amino acids 2684–2944, resulting in the deletion of the N-terminal portion of the NC-1 domain and of the central portion of the triple helical domain (Fig. 1, A andB). However, the von Willebrand factor domain and the cysteine-rich sequences within the NC-1 domain, the N- and C-terminal parts of the triple helix, and the entire NC-2 domain were retained. The construct was thus distinctly smaller than the type VII minicollagen produced by Chen et al. (50Chen M. O′Toole E.A. Muellenhoff M. Medina E. Kas"

https://openalex.org/W2161608940,"Synaptic plasticity is a multistep process in which rapid, early phases eventually give way to slower, more enduring stages. Diverse forms of synaptic change share a common requirement for protein synthesis in the late stages of plasticity, which are often associated with structural rearrangements. Ocular dominance plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1) is a long-lasting form of activity-dependent plasticity comprised of well-defined physiological and anatomical stages. The molecular events underlying these stages remain poorly understood. Using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, we investigated a role for protein synthesis in ocular dominance plasticity. Suppression of cortical, but not geniculate, protein synthesis impaired rapid ocular dominance plasticity, while leaving neuronal responsiveness intact. These findings suggest that structural changes underlying ocular dominance plasticity occur rapidly following monocular occlusion, and cortical changes guide subsequent alterations in thalamocortical afferents."

D. (2000) <i>Nat. Genet.</i> 24, 53–56). Modeling predicted that two of the amino acid substitutions (G1067D and G1142D) interfere with protein-protein interactions at the ATP-binding site-associated dimer interface, one (S1036P) similarly interferes with protein-protein interactions and affects the Msh2 ATP-binding site, and one (H1096A) affects the Msh6 ATP-binding site. The ATPase activity of the Msh2-Msh6-G1067D and Msh2-Msh6-G1142D complexes was inhibited by GT, +A, and +AT mispairs, and these complexes showed increased binding to GT and +A mispairs in the presence of ATP. The ATPase activity of the Msh2-Msh6-S1036P complex was inhibited by a GT mispair, and it bound the GT mispair in the presence of ATP, whereas its interaction with insertion mispairs was unchanged compared with the wild-type complex. The ATPase activity of the Msh2-Msh6-H1096A complex was generally attenuated, and its mispair-binding behavior was unaffected. These results are in contrast to those obtained with the wild-type Msh2-Msh6 complex, which showed mispair-stimulated ATPase activity and ATP inhibition of mispair binding. These results indicate that the dominant <i>msh6</i> mutations cause more stable binding to mispairs and suggest that there may be differences in how base base and insertion mispairs are recognized."

Kir5.1 coexpressed with PSD-95 located on the plasma membrane in a clustered manner, while the Kir5.1 subunit expressed alone distributed mostly in cytoplasm, probably due to rapid internalization. The binding of Kir5.1 with PSD-95 was prevented by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of its carboxyl terminus. The currents flowing through Kir5.1/PSD-95 were suppressed promptly and reversibly by PKA activation. Because the Kir5.1/PSD-95 complex was detected in the brain, this functional brain K+ channel is potentially a novel physiological target of PKA-mediated signaling."

However, the molecular basis for the specific interaction between the RT and Hsp90 remains unknown. Comparison of protein compositional properties suggests that the RT is highly related to the protein kinase c-Raf, which interacts with Hsp90 via the cochaperone p50 (CDC37). We tested whether the RT, like c-Raf, is specifically recognized by p50. Immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays showed that p50 or p50δC, a p50 mutant defective in Hsp90 binding, could interact specifically with the RT both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that p50 can bind the RT independently of Hsp90. Furthermore, purified p50 and p50δC interacted directly with purified RT. The importance of p50-RT interaction for RT functions was underscored by 1) inhibition of protein-primed initiation of reverse transcription by p50δC in vitro and 2) stimulation of viral DNA replication and RNA packaging by p50 and their inhibition by p50δC in transfected cells. These results suggest that p50 can function as a cellular cofactor for the hepadnavirus RT by mediating the interaction between the RT and Hsp90.

The RT is able to initiate DNA synthesis de novo using a specific tyrosine residue located within its N-terminal domain (the terminal protein (TP)) as a protein primer (Refs. 3Lanford R.E. Notvall L.

This protein priming reaction requires the interaction between the RT and a specific RNA signal (termed ε) located on the viral pregenomic RNA (pgRNA; the template for reverse transcription) (8Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5579-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang G.H. Zoulim F. Leber E.H. Kitson J. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8437-8442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ε RNA is used as a specific template for protein priming (and thus, the origin of reverse transcription) (Refs. 9Wang G.H. Zoulim F. Leber E.H. Kitson J. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 8437-8442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wang G.H. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6507-6512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nassal M. Rieger A. J.

In addition, ε serves as the RNA packaging signal (13Hirsch R.C. Loeb D.D. Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3309-3316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Junker-Niepmann M. Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3389-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and directs, through its interaction with the RT, the selective encapsidation of both the pgRNA and the RT into viral nucleocapsids (8Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5579-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore, the specific interaction between the RT and ε triggers two essential early steps in hepadnavirus assembly and replication, i.e. the protein-primed initiation of reverse transcription and the assembly of replication-competent nucleocapsids. Using the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) as a model system, we have recently found that the RT requires the assistance of host cell factors to carry out specific ε binding and protein priming functions (16Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,17Hu J. Toft D.O. Seeger C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). One such cellular factor is the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90). Hsp90 associates with the DHBV RT and is required for RT-ε interaction and protein priming in vitro and for pgRNA packaging and DNA synthesis in vivo. Hsp90 is thought to facilitate the functions of a specific subset of cellular proteins (the target or substrate proteins) by helping to establish and maintain certain poised but labile conformations of these target proteins through a dynamic multistage process (18Bohen S. Kralli A. Yamamoto K. Science. 1995; 268: 1303-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 19Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 20Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In so doing, Hsp90 invariably collaborates with other factors (the so-called cochaperones or cofactors) and forms various multicomponent chaperone complexes. The precise composition of the Hsp90 chaperone complexes seems to vary depending upon the nature of the target proteins and the stage of the chaperoning process. Hsp90 target proteins range from steroid receptors and protein kinases to reverse transcriptase (19Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 20Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 22Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). These proteins do not share any obvious structural or functional similarities. Hence, one of the most enigmatic, unresolved questions about Hsp90 is how the chaperone can recognize specifically such a diverse group of substrates. In our efforts to understand the molecular basis for the interaction between the Hsp90 complex and the viral RT, we searched the data base for Hsp90 target proteins that might share sequence and/or structural properties with the RT. For this purpose, we used a recently described sequence analysis program called protein property search or PropSearch (23Hobohm U. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), which was designed to detect weak structural and/or functional protein homologs that cannot be detected using conventional sequence alignment tools. PropSearch defines protein similarities not through sequence alignment, but as a weighted sum of compositional properties such as singlet and doublet amino acid compositions. By these criteria, we found that the RT is highly related to the serine/threonine protein kinase c-Raf. The protein kinase c-Raf and a selected group of several other serine/threonine and tyrosine-protein kinases (e.g. CDK4 and v-Src) are known to be Hsp90 target proteins, requiring the chaperone for their intracellular trafficking, assembly, and maturation (24Wartmann M. Davis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6695-6701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25van der Straten A. Rommel C. Dickson B. Hafen E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1961-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). An Hsp90 cofactor called p50 (or CDC37) binds specifically to these kinases and to Hsp90 and is thought to be a “kinase-specific subunit” of a particular subset of Hsp90 complexes that targets Hsp90 to the kinase substrates by acting as a bridge between the kinases and Hsp90 (26Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S. Harper J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 27Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell.

In light of these results, we decided to examine whether p50/CDC37 plays a role in the functions of the hepadnavirus RT, as suggested by the similarity between the RT and the protein kinases. Herein, we report that p50/CDC37 could indeed specifically interact with the RT in vitro and in vivo. The functional significance of this interaction was underscored by the fact that p50/CDC37 was able to modulate RT functions, as determined by measuring its protein priming activity in vitro and RNA packaging and DNA synthesis activities in transfected cells. These results thus indicate that p50/CDC37 is a host cell cofactor for hepadnavirus replication and may play a more general role in Hsp90 chaperone function than originally proposed. Plasmid pHTP was used for in vitroexpression of the full-length DHBV RT (6Zoulim F. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing the DHBV mini-RT proteins, pcDNA-MiniRT1 and pcDNA-MiniRT2 (for in vitro and mammalian cell expression) and pGST-MiniRT1 and pGST-MiniRT2 (for bacterial expression of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins) have been described before (29Hu J. Anselmo D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11447-11455Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). pSP-c-Raf directs the in vitro expression of the human c-raf gene under the control of the SP6 promoter in the pSP64polyA vector (Promega) and was kindly provided by Zhijun Luo (Boston Medical Center). pGST-p50 and pGST-p50δC were constructed in a modified pEBG vector and direct the expression of p50/CDC37 and C-terminally truncated p50, respectively, in mammalian cells (27Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). pEBG-MiniRT1 and pEBG-MiniRT2 were constructed by substituting the GST-MiniRT1 and GST-MiniRT2 cassettes from pGST-MiniRT1 and pGST-MiniRT2, respectively, for the GST-p50 sequences in pGST-p50 and were used to express the GST-MiniRT fusion proteins in mammalian cells. All RT and mini-RT proteins were tagged with a synthetic hemagglutinin (HA) epitope inserted into the spacer domain. p50-FLAG, which directs the expression of FLAG epitope-tagged p50 under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter/enhancer, was kindly provided by Gary Perdew (Pennsylvania State University) (30Perdew G.H. Wiegand H. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Mitchell C. Singh S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3600-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). pCMV-DHBV, which directs the expression of the DHBV pgRNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, and its derivative pCMV-YMHA, which harbors two amino acid substitutions in the RT active site abolishing polymerase activity, have been described (31Seeger C. Maragos J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1907-1915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wu T.T. Condreay L.D. Coates L. Aldrich C. Mason W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2155-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Chang L.J. Hirsch R.C. Ganem D. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5553-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCMV-δXM(core) was derived from pCMV-DHBV by removing the DHBV sequences from the uniqueXhoI site (nucleotide 1217) to the MscI site (nucleotide 2375), abolishing the expression of the RT and viral envelope proteins, but retaining core protein expression. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) against p23 (clone JJ3) was generously provided by David Toft (Mayo Clinic) (34Johnson J.L. Beito T.G. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and the anti-p50 mAb (clone C1) by Gary Perdew (30Perdew G.H. Wiegand H. Vanden Heuvel J.P. Mitchell C. Singh S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3600-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The anti-Hsp90 mAb (clone 16F1) was purchased from Stressgen Biotech Corp., and the anti-FLAG mAb (clone M2) from Sigma. Anti-HA mAb HA.11 (clone 16B12) was purchased from BAbCO (Berkeley Antibody). The polyclonal rabbit antibody against the DHBV core antigen was kindly provided by William Mason (Fox Chase Cancer Center) (35Jilbert A.R., Wu, T.T. England J.M. Hall P.M. Carp N.Z. O'Connell A.P. Mason W.S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1377-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-DHBV RT TP domain antibodies were kindly provided by John Tavis (St. Louis University) (36Yao E. Gong Y. Chen N. Tavis J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8648-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). RNAs used forin vitro translation were transcribed from linearized plasmids using an in vitro transcription kit (MEGAscript, Ambion) and were purified as described previously (16Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 29Hu J. Anselmo D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11447-11455Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Purified RNAs were then translated using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system (Promega). Protein expression in the coupled transcription and translation reaction using the TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 10 ng of purified GST-MiniRT proteins were used in an in vitro protein priming reaction in a total volume of 10 μl as described previously (29Hu J. Anselmo D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11447-11455Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (nuclease-treated; Promega) supplemented with an ATP regenerating system (5 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase) was used to reconstitute the RT protein priming activity as described (29Hu J. Anselmo D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11447-11455Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In all reactions, [α-32P]dATP was used as the labeled nucleotide. Two truncated minimal DHBV RT fusion proteins (GST-MiniRT1 and GST-MiniRT2) were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described (29Hu J. Anselmo D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11447-11455Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). FLAG epitope-tagged p50 and p50δC were purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells by immunoaffinity chromatography using agarose-cross-linked mAb M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) as described (27Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Full-length DHBV RT and truncation mutants (labeled by in vitro translation using the reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine) were diluted with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated with p50 or p50δC pre-bound to the mAb M2-agarose beads. The unbound material was removed by extensive washing with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE. Total proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining, and the labeled proteins by autoradiography. To detect direct binding between the RT and p50, purified GST-MiniRT proteins from bacteria were incubated with the FLAG-tagged p50- or p50δC-bound mAb M2 immunoaffinity beads in lysis buffer, and unbound proteins were removed after extensive washing with lysis buffer. The RT proteins bound to the beads were detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-HA mAb following resolution of the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE. To assess p50-RT interaction in cultured cells, pcDNA-MiniRT1 and pcDNA-MiniRT2 were cotransfected with pGST-p50 or pGST-p50δC into 293T or COS-1 cells. The transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer 3 days after transfection, and the p50 proteins were purified by GSH-agarose beads. The mini-RT proteins bound to the p50 proteins were eluted by GSH and detected by resolving the purified proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using either the anti-HA mAb or mAbs against the TP domains. In addition, the GST-MiniRT proteins were coexpressed using pEBG-MiniRT1 and pEBG-MiniRT2 in 293T or COS-1 cells together with FLAG-tagged p50. The GST-MiniRT fusion proteins were then purified by GSH beads and eluted by GSH. Proteins associated with the RT were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The human embryonic kidney cell line 293T and the monkey kidney cell line COS-1 were transfected with pCMV-DHBV, pCMV-δXM(core), or pCMV-YMHA together with a p50 expression construct (pGST-p50 or pGST-p50δC) or the vector alone (pEBG or GST) using the calcium phosphate (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.) procedure (16Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were harvested 3 days after transfection. Replicative viral DNA intermediates were purified from cytoplasmic core particles and analyzed by Southern blot analysis as described (16Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 37Seeger C. Maragos J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 16-23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Encapsidated pgRNA in cytoplasmic core particles obtained by polyethylene glycol precipitation (38Pugh J.C. Yaginuma K. Koike K. Summers J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3513-3616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was detected by resolving the capsid particles on agarose gels followed by Southern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe (spanning nucleotides 143–391 on the DHBV genome) (16Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) as described (39Yu M. Summers J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of assembled capsid particles was determined by subsequent reprobing of the same membrane using the anti-DHBV core antibody. To measure the steady-state levels of total DHBV core protein in the transfected cells, a portion of the cytoplasmic extract used for core DNA isolation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the anti-DHBV core antibody. Because conventional sequence alignment methods have not revealed any similarity between the hepadnavirus RT and other Hsp90 target proteins, we attempted to determine whether the RT is related to any other known Hsp90 target proteins using an alternative sequence comparison method called PropSearch (23Hobohm U. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PropSearch defines protein similarities not through sequence alignment, but as a weighted sum of compositional properties (a total of 144 parameters), including singlet and doublet amino acid composition and isoelectric point, and has been shown to detect weak structural and/or functional protein homologs that escaped detection by conventional sequence alignment tools. A strong similarity in amino acid composition between the RT and c-Raf (kraf), a protein kinase target of Hsp90, was detected by PropSearch (Table I and additional search results not shown). In fact, the similarity between the RT and c-Raf proteins (Table I, ranks 7, 8, and 11) was judged to be stronger than that between the RT and other reverse transcriptases from other retroelements (rank 14) and just below that between the DHBV RT and other hepadnavirus RTs (ranks 1–5). It is not yet known whether the other proteins listed in Table I are Hsp90 targets or not. However, the strong similarity between the RT and c-Raf raised the intriguing possibility that the RT, like c-Raf, may be targeted to the Hsp90 chaperone via p50/CDC37, an Hsp90 cofactor known to be responsible for targeting the kinase substrates to the chaperone.Table ITop 20 candidate proteins related to the DHBV RT as identified by PropSearchRankIDDISTLEN2pIDE1dpol_hpbdu2.2583610.67DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7)2dpol_hpbdb3.7278810.72DNA polymerase (EC2.7.7.7)3dpol_hpbdw3.8578810.75DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7)4dpol_hpbdc3.9178710.76DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7)5dpol_hpbhe5.4878810.74DNA polymerase (EC2.7.7.7)6pop1_yeast8.0187510.62RNases P/MRP protein POP17kraf_human8.276489.88Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase (EC 2.7.1–)8kraf_xenla8.406389.81Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase (EC 2.7.1–)9kmil_chick8.466479.89Mil proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase (EC 2.7.1–)10kalm_chick8.596769.67Kallmann syndrome protein homolog precursor11kraf_rat8.686489.89Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase (EC 2.7.1–)12rad4_schpo8.686488.10RAD4 protein (CUT5 protein, p74)13yez9_yeast8.707969.84Putative 90.2-kDa zinc finger protein in CCA1-ADK2 intergenic region14pol_mmtvb8.998999.25Pol polyprotein (contains reverse transcriptase (EC 2.7.7.49))15kith_hsvsa9.0152710.05Thymidine kinase (EC2.7.1.21)16yd59_schpo9.097868.55Hypothetical protein C6C3.09C in chromosome I (fragment)17yg22_yeast9.206429.53Hypothetical 71.3-kDa Protein in SCM4-MUP1 intergenic region18ym91_schpo9.2080710.60Hypothetical 91-kDa protein in COB intron19rrpo_mcmv9.2996410.28Probable RNA-directed RNA polymerase (111 kDa) (EC 2.7.7.48)20mta1_rat9.307039.88Metastasis-associated protein MTA1Rank indicates the position of the protein found after sorting on DIST.

To determine whether the RT could associate with p50 specifically, we expressed the35S-labeled DHBV RT by in vitro translation in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, in which an active DHBV RT can be expressed (4Wang G.H. Seeger C. Cell. 1992; 71: 663-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and is associated with Hsp90 and one of the cochaperones, p23 (16Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The labeled RT proteins were then co-immunoprecipitated with purified FLAG-tagged p50 pre-bound to antibody affinity beads. Bound proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the RT could be co-immunoprecipitated by the p50 beads (lane 1), similar to c-Raf (lane 4), which was used as a positive control. The negative control (in vitro translated luciferase) was not precipitated by the p50 beads (Fig. 1 A, lane 7). As p50 is known to bind to Hsp90 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1, 4, and 7) (27Grammatikakis N.

A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), it was possible that the RT was associated with p50 via Hsp90. To test whether p50 could associate with the RT independently of Hsp90, a p50 mutant (p50δC) with its C-terminal Hsp90-binding domain deleted, and thus unable to bind Hsp90 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2, 5, and 8) (27Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), was used to precipitate the RT. We found that p50δC could also associate with the RT (Fig.1 A, lane 2) as well as c-Raf (lane 5), indicating that the interaction between p50 and the RT (like c-Raf) (27Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) is independent of its association with Hsp90. Interestingly, p50δC seemed to bind even more in vitro translated RT proteins than wild-type p50, which was also the case when they were coexpressed in cultured cells (see Fig. 3 below).Figure 3Association of mini-RT proteins with p50 and p50δC in cells. pcDNA-MiniRT1 and pcDNA-MiniRT2 were transfected into 293T cells together with pGST-p50, pGST-p50δC, or pGST (as a vector control). Transfected cells were then lysed in lysis buffer. Insoluble materials were removed by pelleting in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was incubated with GSH beads to pull down GST-p50, GST-p50δC, or GST alone. Bound proteins were eluted with GSH (eluate). The soluble (lanes 1–6), insoluble (lanes 7–12), and eluate (lanes 13–18) materials were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-HA mAb against the HA epitope inserted into the mini-RT proteins (A) or by Coomassie blue staining (B). The intact MiniRT1 and MiniRT2 proteins and the degradation product containing the TP domain are indicated in A. In B, the arrowheadsdenote GST-p50 (lanes 3, 6, 9,12, 15, and 18), GST-p50δC (lanes 2, 5, 8, 11,14, and 17), and GST (lanes 1,4, 13, and 16). p50-associated Hsp90 evident in lanes 15 and 18 is also indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the RT could bind directly to p50, as c-Raf does (27Grammatikakis N.

We found that both GST-MiniRT1 and GST-MiniRT2 (but not GST alone) could bind directly to purified p50 and p50δC (Fig.2) (data not shown). Therefore, these results showed that the DHBV RT could directly associate with p50in vitro, independently of Hsp90 or any other cellular factors. To determine whether the RT could associate with p50 in the cell, we coexpressed functional mini-RT proteins (29Hu J. Anselmo D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11447-11455Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) together with GST-tagged p50 in 293T cells, which can be transfected efficiently. As shown in Fig.3 (lanes 13–18), GST-tagged p50δC proteins specifically pulled down the mini-RT proteins expressed in 293T cells. (Similar results were also obtained using COS cells (data not shown).) In addition to the intact mini-RT proteins, we noticed that a major degradation product derived from both mini-RT proteins was also pulled down by p50δC. This degradation product reacted with both the anti-HA mAb (Fig. 3 A) and several antibodies (both monoclonal and polyclonal) against the TP domain (data not shown), indicating that it represented the TP fragment with some residual sequences from the spacer region where the HA epitope was inserted. On the other hand, the binding of the RT to wild-type p50 seemed to be weaker and more variable (Fig. 3) (data not shown). In addition, we noticed that p50δC"

None of these Mgat3 T37/T37 traits were exhibited by Mgat3 Δ/Δ mice or by heterozygous mice carrying the Mgat3 T37 mutation. Similarly, no dominant-negative effect was observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing truncated GlcNAc-TIII in the presence of wild-type GlcNAc-TIII. However, compound heterozygotes carrying both the Mgat3 T37 and Mgat3 Δmutations exhibited a marked leg clasp reflex, indicating that in the absence of wild-type GlcNAc-TIII, truncated GlcNAc-TIII causes this phenotype. The Mgat3 gene was expressed in brain at embryonic day 10.5 and thereafter and in neurons of adult cerebellum. The mutant Mgat3 gene was also highly expressed inMgat3 T37/T37 brain.

N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase Chinese hamster ovary erythroagglutinin from P. vulgaris phosphate-buffered saline matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry The N-glycans of mammalian glycoproteins vary widely in structure, but the biological significance of this variation is largely unknown. A well studied example is the bisecting GlcNAc. This residue is transferred to the β-linked Man of the core ofN-glycans by the glycosyltransferase termedN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GlcNAc-TIII1; EC2.4.1.144) (1Narasimhan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10235-10242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the product of the Mgat3 gene (2Ihara Y. Nishikawa A. Tohma T. Soejima H. Niikawa N. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The presence of the bisecting GlcNAc alters the lectin binding properties of a cell, a fact initially revealed by the gain-of-function Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) glycosylation mutant LEC10, which expresses GlcNAc-TIII (3Campbell C. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13370-13378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LEC10 cells are ∼15-fold more resistant to ricin and ∼10-fold more sensitive to the toxicity of the erythroagglutinin fromPhaseolus vulgaris (E-PHA) compared with wild-type CHO cells, reflecting dramatic changes in binding of these lectins toN-linked Gal residues of cell-surface glycoproteins. Similarly, the ectopic expression of an Mgat3cDNA reduces the expression of terminal α3-Gal residues, a key determinant in xenotransplantation (4Miyagawa S. Murakami H. Takahagi Y. Nakai R. Yamada M.

The regulated expression of the Mgat3 gene could therefore control the binding of animal lectins like galectins to cell-surface N-glycans with a bisecting GlcNAc and thereby modulate cellular interactions. The expression of the Mgat3 gene varies in a tissue-specific fashion in mice (6Bhaumik M. Seldin M.F. Stanley P.

To identify new functions for N-glycans with a bisecting GlcNAc, the Mgat3 gene has been inactivated by targeted mutations in the mouse. Priatel et al. (7Priatel J.J. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Marth J.D. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) used a Cre/loxP strategy to delete the Mgat3 gene coding region, whereas Bhaumik et al. (12Bhaumik M. Harris T. Sundaram S. Johnson L. Guttenplan J. Rogler C. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2881-2887PubMed Google Scholar) inserted apgkneo cassette into the Mgat3 gene to disrupt the coding region. Both mutations retard the progression of liver tumors in homozygotes treated with diethylnitrosamine and phenobarbital (12Bhaumik M. Harris T. Sundaram S. Johnson L. Guttenplan J. Rogler C. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2881-2887PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yang X. Bhaumik M. Bhattacharyya R. Gong S. Rogler C.E. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3313-3319PubMed Google Scholar). Although deletion of the Mgat3 gene coding region (Mgat3 Δ mutation) causes no overt phenotypic traits in a mixed or C57BL/6 genetic background (7Priatel J.J. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Marth J.D. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), elimination of GlcNAc-TIII activity by disruption of the Mgat3 gene was preliminarily reported to give rise to neurological and other consequences in mice of mixed genetic background (21Bhaumik M. Sundaram S. Stanley P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 720Google Scholar). We now describe these traits in detail and show that they are maintained or become more severe after backcrossing 11 generations onto the 129SvJbackground. By contrast, Mgat3 Δ/Δ mice do not exhibit the same traits in either mixed or inbred genetic backgrounds. The targeted Mgat3 allele gives rise to a truncated, enzymatically inactive GlcNAc-TIII that induces a partial mutant phenotype in Mgat3 T37 /Δcompound heterozygotes. Humans with related nonsense mutations in theMGAT3 gene may have neurological or behavioral problems. UDP-[6-3H]Gal (10 Ci/mmol), UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (41.60 Ci/mmol), and concanavalin A-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. Biotinylated E-PHA lectins were from Vector Labs, Inc. Bio-Gel P-2 (45–95 mesh), the DC protein assay reagent, and AG 1-X4 resin (200–400 mesh, Cl− form) were from Bio-Rad.

G418, fetal bovine serum, and α-medium were from Invitrogen. Ecolume was from ICN Biomedicals, andN-glycanase from New England Biolabs Inc. The Mgat3 tm1Pst insertion mutation was previously generated by introducing apgkneo gene in reverse orientation into the NcoI site of the Mgat3 gene in WW6 embryonic stem cells and termed Mgat3 neo (12Bhaumik M. Harris T. Sundaram S. Johnson L. Guttenplan J. Rogler C. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2881-2887PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yang X. Bhaumik M. Bhattacharyya R. Gong S. Rogler C.E. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3313-3319PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we show that a truncated GlcNAc-TIII of ∼37 kDa (predicted 371 or 374 amino acids based on encoded stop codons) is produced from the targeted allele. Henceforth, this mutant allele will therefore be termed Mgat3 T37 to better reflect the nature of its product. Heterozygous Mgat3 T37 /+ progeny from chimeras generated by injection of C57BL/6 blastocysts withMgat3 T37 /+ WW6 embryonic stem cells were crossed to CD1 mice, and cousins were interbred to obtain F1, F2, and F3 generations ofMgat3 +/+,Mgat3 T37 /+, andMgat3T37/T37 mice. The Mgat3 tm1Jxm mutation (termed Mgat3 Δ) was previously generated by deleting the coding region of the Mgat3 gene using a Cre/loxP strategy (7Priatel J.J. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Marth J.D.

Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) by injection into C57BL/6 blastocysts; crossing of chimeras to CD1 mice; and interbreeding cousins to obtain F1, F2, and F3 Mgat3 +/+, Mgat3 Δ/+, andMgat3 Δ/Δ mice as described (19Yang X. Bhaumik M. Bhattacharyya R. Gong S. Rogler C.E. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3313-3319PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain compound heterozygotes, Mgat3 T37/T37 mice were crossed to Mgat3 Δ/Δ mice to generateMgat3 T37 /Δ mice.Mgat3 T37 /+ mice from the CD1 mixed genetic background were backcrossed to wild-type 129SvJmice for 11 generations, and heterozygous progeny were interbred to derive mice heterozygous and homozygous for theMgat3 T37 mutation in a 129SvJbackground. Methods for detecting wild-type Mgat3 and mutantMgat3 T37 and Mgat3 Δ alleles by PCR and Southern analysis of tail genomic DNA using the primers and probes shown in Fig. 1 A have been previously described (7Priatel J.J.

Total RNA from mouse kidney or brain was prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), electrophoresed on a denaturing 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to membrane, and probed with a 584-bpBglI/PstI fragment of the Mgat3 gene coding exon (probe V; see Fig. 1 A) or the neogene probe (probe X; see Fig. 1 A) as described (6Bhaumik M.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2881-2887PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from embryonic head at different times of gestation was isolated using Trizol reagent and then electrophoresed and probed with the Mgat3 gene coding exon probe as described above. To determine that the ∼6.5-kb transcript from the targeted allele was generated from endogenous Mgat3 gene promoter(s), reverse transcription was performed in 20 μl containing 10 μg of total RNA from Mgat3 T37/T37 kidney, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.5 mm dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1000 units/ml RNase inhibitor (Promega), 0.5 μg of oligo[dT(n)6] oligonucleotides (Amersham Biosciences), and 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After incubation at 42 °C for 1 h, a 5-μl aliquot was subjected to PCR using primers 63 and 99 (see Fig.1 A). PCR was performed through 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 15 min. Products of the size expected (0.4 kb) for transcripts from the sense Mgat3 T37 gene orientation were obtained. Parental CHO cells and the gain-of-function CHO mutant LEC10 (3Campbell C. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13370-13378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in suspension at 37 °C in complete α-medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. cDNAs encoding the Mgat3 gene coding region or theMgat3 T37 gene were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA (5 μg) was linearized byXhoI digestion, purified by ethanol precipitation, and transfected into parental CHO or LEC10 cells (∼4 × 106 in 750 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) using a Bio-Rad electroporator (pulse, 0.3 kV; capacitance, 975 microfarads; and average time constant, 12 ms). Selection of stable transfectants was performed by adding G418 (1 mg/ml active weight) 24 h after plating. Colonies that survived G418 selection were isolated and characterized. GlcNAc-TIII and GlcNAc-TI activities were assayed in a volume of 40 μl as described (12Bhaumik M. Harris T. Sundaram S. Johnson L. Guttenplan J. Rogler C. Stanley P.

UDP[3H]GlcNAc (Amersham Biosciences) was diluted to a specific activity of ∼10,000 cpm/nmol, and ∼24 nmol were included in each assay. β4Galactosyltransferase activities were assayed using GlcNAc as acceptor and UDP[3H]Gal as donor as described (22Lee J.

For lectin blots, CHO cells or kidney or brain extracts (50 μg of protein) from mice perfused with cold PBS (pH 7.2) were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Desialylation was performed in 25 mm sulfuric acid at 80 °C for 1 h. Biotinylated lectins (Vector Labs, Inc.) were used to detect the presence of the bisecting GlcNAc onN-glycans as described (12Bhaumik M. Harris T. Sundaram S. Johnson L. Guttenplan J. Rogler C.

For Western blots, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against amino acids 120–136 of mouse GlcNAc-TIII (TRMLEKPSPGRTEEKTE), synthesized by the Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis and Proteomics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, was used as described (19Yang X. Bhaumik M. Bhattacharyya R. Gong S. Rogler C.E. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3313-3319PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain kidneyN-glycans for analysis, mice were perfused with PBS, and kidney pieces at 150 mg/ml were homogenized for 5 min on ice in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mmsucrose, 0.25 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.28 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Triton X-100 was added to 2% by volume; nuclei were removed by centrifugation; glycerol was added to 20% by volume; and extracts were stored at –70 °C. Protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad protein dye reagent. N-Glycans were released from glycoproteins immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by treatment withN-glycanase as described (22Lee J. Sundaram S. Shaper N.L. Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol.

A nitrogen laser irradiated samples at 337 nm, and an average of 240 scans were taken. The instrument was operated in linear configuration (1.2-m flight path), and an acceleration voltage of 20 kV was used after a 60-ns delay. Samples (0.5 μl) were applied to a polished stainless steel target to which 0.3 μl of matrix was added and dried under vacuum (50 × 10−3 torr). Oligosaccharide standards were used to achieve a two-point external calibration for mass assignment of ions (23Papac D.I. Wong A. Jones A.J. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3215-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 24Raju T.S. Briggs J.B. Borge S.M. Jones A.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid and 5-methoxysalicylic acid matrix was used for neutral oligosaccharides. Mice were maintained in a barrier facility with food and water provided ad libitum and weighed on the same day at the same time each week. To measure gait, each hind paw was dipped in Indian ink, and the mouse was allowed to walk undisturbed on a 4.5 × 3.5-foot piece of Whatman filter paper. The distance between hind footsteps was measured by the manual method as described (25Steinberg H. Sykes E.A. McBride A. Terry P. Robinson K. Tillotson H. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1989; 21: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To record the altered leg clasp reflex, each mouse was suspended by the tail for a maximum of 2 min and photographed using a video camera. The time of holding of the rear leg clasp was recorded. Brain sections prepared by cryostat from perfused mice were thawed at room temperature for 30 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS at room temperature for 15 min, and washed three times with PBS. The sections were acetylated twice in 0.1m triethanolamine and acetic anhydride at room temperature for 10 min and washed twice with PBS, followed by dehydration in 30, 50, 70, 90, 95, and 100% ethanol for 5 min each. After dipping in chloroform for 5 min at room temperature and in 0.2× SSC for 1–2 min, prehybridization was carried out in a moist chamber with 50% formamide in 5× SSC at 45 °C for 3 h. For hybridization, 35S-UTP-labeled antisense and sense RNAs encoding the Mgat3 gene coding region were prepared from a mouse Mgat3 cDNA (6Bhaumik M. Seldin M.F. Stanley P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega); probes were hydrolyzed; and hybridization, washing, and autoradiography were performed as described previously (26Yang J. Bhaumik M. Liu Y. Stanley P. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the insertion of a pgkneo gene in reverse orientation into the NcoI site of theMgat3 gene abrogates GlcNAc-TIII activity from mouse tissues (12Bhaumik M. Harris T. Sundaram S. Johnson L. Guttenplan J. Rogler C. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2881-2887PubMed Google Scholar). However, the stop codons that occur in the pgkneoreverse sequence (Fig. 1 A) did not cause nonsense-mediated decay, as was obtained previously with a similarly disrupted Mgat1 gene coding exon (27Ioffe E. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 28Ioffe E. Liu Y. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11041-11046Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Northern analysis (Fig. 1 B) and reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown) revealed read-through transcripts fromMgat3 gene promoter(s) that were present at similar or greater levels than transcripts from the endogenous Mgat3gene in brain and kidney. The size of the novel transcripts was ∼6.5 kb and included the ∼4.7-kb Mgat3 gene coding and untranslated regions with the ∼1.8-kb antisense transcript from the pgkneo cassette. Transcription was fromMgat3 gene promoter(s) because reverse transcription-PCR of kidney and brain transcripts from homozygous mutant mice using an oligo(dT) primer for reverse transcription and primers 63 and 99 (Fig.1 A) for PCR gave the predicted product (data not shown), and Western analysis (see below) revealed a protein product. Sense transcripts of ∼1.8 kb that would encode an active neomycin phosphotransferase protein were not detected by Northern analysis in kidney (Fig. 1 B) or brain (data not shown) RNA. The signal present in all lanes at ∼1.8 kb in Fig. 1 B presumably comes from cross-hybridization of the probe with 18 S RNA because it was present in wild-type mice lacking the pgkneo gene. A truncated GlcNAc-TIII predicted to comprise 371 or 374 amino acids was produced from the ∼6.5-kb transcripts. It was detected by Western analysis of mouse tissues, faintly in LEC10 CHO cells, and readily in CHO transfectants using a peptide affinity-purified anti-GlcNAc-TIII antibody made against N-terminal amino acids 120–136 (Fig.1 C). The disrupted Mgat3 gene that gives rise to the truncated product will henceforth be referred to as the mutantMgat3 T37 allele. Truncated GlcNAc-TIII was also present in brain extracts from Mgat3 T37/T37 mice (data not shown). Wild-type GlcNAc-TIII migrated at a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa, just above a nonspecific band detected in kidney and brain. GlcNAc-TIII assays of stable CHO transfectants overexpressing wild-typeMgat3 cDNA gave an activity of 17.9 nmol/mg/h compared with <0.01 nmol/mg/h for cells expressing truncated GlcNAc-TIII in the same vector. Both types of transfectant expressed equivalent activities of unrelated glycosyltransferases such as β4galactosyltransferase and GlcNAc-TI (data not shown). Previous studies detected no GlcNAc-TIII activity in kidney or brain extracts ofMgat3 T37/T37 mice (12Bhaumik M. Harris T. Sundaram S. Johnson L. Guttenplan J. Rogler C. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2881-2887PubMed Google Scholar). Mgat3 Δ/Δ mice from predominantly C57BL/6 or 129SvJ genetic backgrounds exhibit no overt phenotype (7Priatel J.J. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Marth J.D. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), 2J. D. Marth, personal communication.whereas Mgat3 T37/T37 mice on a mixed genetic background were observed, in a preliminary report, to possess several distinctive traits different from those of wild-type littermates (21Bhaumik M. Sundaram S. Stanley P. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 720Google Scholar). To investigate the phenotype associated with theMgat3 T37 mutation and to determine whether the discrepancy with the Mgat3 Δ mutation was due to genetic background, Mgat3 Δ/+ andMgat3 T37 /+ mice were generated on a similar mixed background (predominantly 129SvJ and CD1) (19Yang X. Bhaumik M. Bhattacharyya R. Gong S. Rogler C.E. Stanley P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3313-3319PubMed Google Scholar) and bred through cousin matings to obtain wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous progeny for phenotypic comparisons. The lack of complexN-glycans with a bisecting GlcNAc was confirmed in homozygotes by analyzing the N-glycans released byN-glycanase from kidney glycoproteins ofMgat3 T37/T37 , Mgat3 Δ/Δ, and wild-type littermates by MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig.2). Spectra from two wild-type and two homozygous mutants of each strain were distinguished only by the presence (in wild-type) and absence (in mutants) of glycans with masses predicted for bi-, tri-, or tetraantennary N-glycans with an unsubstituted HexNAc residue (TableI). Based on previous lectin blot analyses (7Priatel J.J. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Marth J.D. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Bhaumik M. Harris T. Sundaram S.

The spectra show a remarkable reproducibility in the profile of N-glycans synthesized by the kidneys of unrelated mice from the two strains (Table I). It is important to note that the presence of C-terminally truncated GlcNAc-TIII inMgat3 T37/T37 kidney did not significantly change the spectrum of complex N-glycans expressed byMgat3 T37/T37 compared withMgat3 Δ/Δ mice.Table INeutral N-glycans from kidneys of Mgat3 T37/T37 and Mgat3 Δ/Δ MicePredicted neutral, complex N-glycan structurePredicted mass ([M + Na+])Area under peak Mgat3 +/+ Mgat3 T37/T37 Mgat3 +/+ Mgat3 Δ/Δ %Biantennary G2Gn2M3Gn2F1810.62.95.73.03.2 G2Gn2(F)M3Gn2F1956.18.69.7 G2Gn2(F2)M3Gn2F2102.93.819.121.3*G1Gn2(Gn)M3Gn2F1851.77.47.2*G2Gn2(Gn)M3Gn2F2013.83.3*G1Gn2(F)(Gn)M3Gn2F1997.88.37.1*G2Gn2(F)(Gn)M3Gn2F21606.37.3*G2Gn2(F2)(Gn)M3Gn2F2306.125.620.8Triantennary G3Gn3(F2)M3Gn2F2468.23.65.1 G3Gn3(F3)M3Gn2F2614.48.410.7*G3Gn3(F2)(Gn)M3Gn2F2671.43.23.4*G3Gn3(F3)(Gn)M3Gn2F2817.58.39.1Tetraantennary G4Gn4(F2)M3Gn2F2833.62.92.2 G4Gn4(F3)M3Gn2F2979.73.73.3 G4Gn4(F4)M3Gn2F3125.85.75.5*G4Gn4(F2)(Gn)M3Gn2F3036.81.8*G4Gn4(F3)(Gn)M3Gn2F3182.92.1*G4Gn4(F4)(Gn)M3Gn2F3329.12.83.2Shown is a summary of MALDI-TOF spectra in Fig. 2.

In this study, we identified His308 and Arg277 residues as essential determinants for the donor substrate (UDP-glucuronic acid) selectivity of the human GlcAT-I. Analysis of the UDP-glucuronic acid-binding site by computational modeling in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis indicated that both residues interact with glucuronic acid. Substitution of His308 by arginine induced major changes in the donor substrate specificity of GlcAT-I. Interestingly, the H308R mutant was able to efficiently utilize nucleotide sugars UDP-glucose, UDP-mannose, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, which are not naturally accepted by the wild-type enzyme, as co-substrate in the transfer reaction. To gain insight into the role of Arg277, site-directed mutagenesis in combination with chemical modification was carried out. Substitution of Arg277 with alanine abrogated the activity of GlcAT-I. Furthermore, the arginine-directed reagent 2,3-butanedione irreversibly inhibited GlcAT-I, which was effectively protected against inactivation by UDP-glucuronic acid but not by UDP-glucose. It is noteworthy that the activity of the H308R mutant toward UDP-glucose was unaffected by the arginine-directed reagent. Our results are consistent with crucial interactions between the His308 and Arg277 residues and the glucuronic acid moiety that governs the specificity of GlcAT-I toward the nucleotide sugar donor substrate.

Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 2Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). PGs are abundant polyanionic molecules present in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface mediating diverse cellular processes through interactions of GAG chains with a variety of protein ligands including growth factors, adhesion molecules, and enzymes. The heparan sulfate (HS) GAG chains attached to PGs located in the plasma membrane are increasingly implicated in the regulation of signal transduction (3Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar, 4Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The key role played by HS in the control of the signaling of morphogens such as Hedgehog proteins as well as growth factors during development has been established in Drosophila melanogaster, mouse, and human (for review see Ref. 5Selleck S.B. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 206-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). On the other hand, investigation of the role of the chondroitin sulfate (CS) GAG chains of neural PGs such as phosphacan has highlighted their importance in the development of mammalian brain (for review see Ref. 6Oohira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The integrity of CS chains of aggrecan, a predominant structural PG of articular cartilage is also essential for maintaining the specific mechanical and functional properties of this tissue (7Vertel B.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 458-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological activity of PGs is intimately related to GAG biosynthesis. Indeed, defects in the assembly of GAG chains have severe biological consequences in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Mutations in galactosyltransferase I involved in the initiation of GAG chains are associated with the human inherited Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is characterized by many developmental abnormalities (8Okajima T. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Urano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28841-28844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The hereditary human multiple exostoses syndrome, which is characterized by skeletal malformations leading in some cases to malignant chondrosarcomas, is caused by defects in EXT genes that encode glycosyltransferases (GT) responsible for the polymerization of HS chains (9McCormick C. Duncan G. Tufaro F. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 481-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The assembly of galactosaminoglycan (CS/dermatan sulfate) and glucosaminoglycan (HS/heparin) chains is initiated by the formation of a tetrasaccharide primer, GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-Ser, covalently attached to specific serine residues of different core proteins (for review see Ref. 10Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This linkage tetrasaccharide serves as a primer for the attachment of either N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) orN-acetylgalactosamine, thus initiating the formation of HS and CS, respectively. The HS chains are then elongated by the alternate additions of β-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and α-GlcNAc catalyzed by HS polymerase (EXT1/EXT2) (11McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Polymerization of the CS chains is performed by the alternate conjugations of β-GlcA and β-N-acetylgalactosamine (12Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The final step of the assembly process of the linkage tetrasaccharide sequence is catalyzed by GlcAT-I, a member of the glucuronosyltransferase family catalyzing the formation of GlcAβ1,3Gal linkages on glycoproteins or glycolipids. This enzyme has received much attention because it plays a central role at a branching point common to various GAG chains (13Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka O. Kawasaki T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6615-6618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested to be a regulatory factor in the biosynthesis of GAG in Chinese hamster ovary cells (14Bai X. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Importantly, we recently demonstrated that the down-regulation of GlcAT-I by interleukin 1 may contribute to the reduced biosynthesis of GAGs observed after treatment of chondrocytes with this proinflammatory cytokine (15Gouze J.N. Bordji K. Gulberti S. Terlain B. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. Ouzzine M. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of the structure-function relationships of human GlcAT-I is thus essential to gain insight into the molecular basis of the assembly of GAG chains in physiological and pathological conditions. Studies involving cDNA cloning and x-ray crystal structure analysis have provided important clues to solve the organization of several GT including GlcAT-I (16Ünligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 17Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although these proteins have very different primary amino acid sequences, they share several common structural features (19Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). GlcAT-I is a type II Golgi-resident membrane-bound glycoprotein with a pattern of organization similar to that of other GT members. It consists of a lumen-orientated C terminus containing the catalytic domain followed by an extended region called the “stem region,” a single membrane-spanning region, and a short cytoplasmic N terminus. We have been deeply involved in elucidating the determinants governing the structure and function of human GlcAT-I (15Gouze J.N. Bordji K. Gulberti S. Terlain B. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. Ouzzine M. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 20Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the enzyme is organized as a homodimer as a result of disulfide bond formation mediated by Cys33 in the stem region (20Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the specificity of GlcAT-I toward the nucleotide sugar donor substrate UDP-GlcA has not yet been elucidated. To gain insight into the molecular details of GlcA binding and transfer on the terminal galactose residue of the growing linkage region Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-Ser, we have engineered GlcAT-I point mutations based on available structural data combined with computational modeling. We examined the consequences of amino acid substitutions on the specificity of the enzyme toward the donor substrate after heterologous expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Interestingly, conversion of the His308residue to arginine was sufficient to alter the specificity of GlcAT-I enabling the enzyme to use a variety of donor UDP-sugar co-substrates. Furthermore, we present evidence that the residue Arg277 is required for the activity of GlcAT-I toward UDP-GlcA. These results provide major new information on how this enzyme executes catalysis with high specificity toward GlcA to produce the linkage region common to various GAG chains. UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal), UDP-galacturonic acid (UDP-GalA), UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), UDP-mannose (UDP-Man), galactosyl-β1,3-thiogalactose (Gal-Gal), β-glucuronidase (bovine liver), β-glucosidase (Caldocellum saccharolyticum), aniline, anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated immunoglobulins, and methanol were from Sigma. GDP-mannose (GDP-Man) was from CN Biosciences (Nottingham, UK). 2,3-Butanedione was purchased from Fluka (L'Isle d'Abeau, France). UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Bacterial and yeast culture media were from Difco (Le Pont de Chaix, France). The protein assay reagent was obtained from Bio-Rad. The restriction enzymes and vent DNA polymerase were provided by New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK). T4 DNA ligase, theP. pastoris expression system, and competentEscherichia coli cells were from Invitrogen. Cloning of the full-length GlcAT-I cDNA and construction of the recombinant pPICZ-GlcAT-I vector designed for the expression in the methyltrophic yeast P. pastoris was performed as previously described (20Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For the construction of amino acid substituted mutants of GlcAT-I, two rounds of PCR were carried out (20Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Ouzzine M. Antonio L. Burchell B. Netter P. Fournel-Gigleux S. Magdalou J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the first PCR, a sense primer including an EcoRI site and a Kozak consensus sequence and corresponding to the 10 first amino acids of the GlcAT-I coding sequence (primer A) and one of the antisense internal mutagenic oligonucleotides listed below were used as the primers: H308A (5′-CTTCTCTGTCCGAGTGGCCCACACCAGTACCCGA-3′), H308R (5′-CTTCTCTGTCCGAGTGCGCCACACCAGTACCCGA-3′), and R277A (5′-TCTCCAGGTGGCCCGCGGGAGCGGTGGAAT-3′). In the second round of PCR, the respective sense internal mutagenic oligonucleotide (complementary to the antisense internal mutagenic oligonucleotide) and the primer comprising a XbaI site, a stop codon, and nucleotides 1005–989 of GlcAT-I (primer B) were used as primers. The pPICZ-GlcAT-I plasmid and the pPICZ-GlcAT-I H308R plasmid (to generate the double H308R/R277A mutation) were used as templates. In the final PCR, aliquots of both purified PCR products from the above reactions were used as a template. The two fragments were hybridizedvia the overlapping region from the sense and antisense primers introducing the mutation. Amplification of the mutated full-length cDNAs was achieved by PCR using primers A and B. The final PCR products were digested with EcoRI andXbaI restriction enzymes and subsequently inserted into the pPICZB plasmid digested with the same enzymes. Each recombinant pPICZ vector (pPICZ-GlcAT-I, pPICZ-GlcAT-I-H308A, pPICZ-GlcAT-I-H308R, pPICZ-GlcAT-I-R277A, and pPICZ-GlcAT-I-H308A/R277A) was individually transformed into theP. pastoris SMD1168 yeast strain using the Easy-Comp kit (Invitrogen). Transformants were selected on YPD plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose) containing 100 μg/ml of Zeocin. The cells were grown in BMGY medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, and 1% (v/v) glycerol). Expression was induced in BMGY medium with 1% (v/v) glycerol replaced by 2% (v/v) methanol and carried out for 48 h at 30 °C in a rotary shaker (215 rpm). Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × gfor 10 min and further submitted to subcellular fractionation as previously described (22Ouzzine M. Magdalou J. Burchell B. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31401-31409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, after harvest, the cells were washed once and suspended in cold breaking buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5% (v/v) glycerol). The cells were then broken with glass beads. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The membranes were pelleted from the supernatant for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was resuspended by Dounce homogenization in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4). The protein concentration was evaluated by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) before analysis by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed using a polyclonal anti-GlcAT-I antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulins as secondary antibodies, as previously described (20Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Activity of the recombinant human GlcAT-I was evaluated using Gal-Gal as an acceptor substrate as previously described (20Ouzzine M. Gulberti S. Netter P. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28254-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, standard incubations were performed in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) with 10 mm MnCl2, 10–50 μg of membrane protein, 1 mm Gal-Gal, and 1 mm UDP-GlcA in a total volume of 100 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, and the reaction was terminated by placing the tube on ice and adding 10 μl of 6 n HCl. UDP-GalA, UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-Man, and GDP-Man were similarly tested as nucleotide sugar donor substrates. The proteins were then precipitated by centrifugation, and the enzymatic reaction product was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after chromophore labeling by reductive amination using aniline as previously described (20Ouzzine M.

Sweely C.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 366-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The labeled water-soluble product was analyzed by HPLC on a reverse phase C-18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 4 μm; Waters, Milford, MA) at a detection wavelength of 280 nm according to a method adapted from Pless et al. (26Pless D. Gouze J.N. Senay C., V., B. Fournel-Gigleux S. Magdalou J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1999; 27: 588-595PubMed Google Scholar). The mobile phase was composed of 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.015% (v/v) formic acid, and 0.03% (v/v) triethylamine in water (pH 4.0) and used at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Control assays in which either the donor substrate (UDP-GlcA or the other UDP-sugars) or the acceptor substrate Gal-Gal was omitted were simultaneously run under the same conditions. Because the labeled disaccharide and trisaccharide reaction products present the same extinction coefficient, quantification of the trisaccharide product was performed by comparison with calibration curves established upon injection of increasing amounts of authentic Gal-Gal following chromophore labeling. The response (peak area) was linear from 0.05 to 5 nmol of Gal-Gal injected. The detection limit was 25 pmol of product, under our experimental conditions. Addition of a GlcA residue on the nonreducing end of Gal-Gal was verified by the susceptibility of the products to hydrolysis by β-glucuronidase from bovine liver. β-Glucuronidase (600 units) was dissolved in 200 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) and added to 100 μl of the reaction mixture. The incubation was conducted for 4 h at 37 °C. To verify glucose transfer onto the Gal-Gal acceptor, β-glucosidase from C. saccharolyticum (10 units) was dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.5) and added to 100 μl of the reaction mixture as described (27Plant A.R. Oliver J.E. Patchett M.L. Daniel R.M. Morgan H.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The reaction was conducted for 6 h at 37 °C and stopped by cooling on ice. The disappearance of the reaction product following β-glucuronidase or β-glucosidase treatment was monitored by HPLC as described above. The apparent kinetic parameters (K m and V max) were determined using linear least squares regression analysis of double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus UDP-sugar (0–2 mm) at a constant concentration of Gal-Gal (1 mm). Inactivation of wild-type GlcAT-I and of the H308R mutant with the arginine-directed reagent 2,3-butanedione was performed at 25 °C in the dark using 30 μg of protein of membrane fraction in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 10 mm MnCl2. Inactivation was started by the addition of 2,3-butanedione (0–15 mm) freshly prepared in ice-cold absolute ethanol. The aliquots were removed at times 0–20 min and quenched by a 10-fold dilution in buffer and activity toward UDP-GlcA or UDP-Glc was determined as described above. For protection experiments, UDP-GlcA or UDP-Glc (10 mm) was preincubated with proteins for 15 min before the addition of 2,3-butanedione. In a second set of experiments, the membrane fractions from recombinant yeast cells were treated with 2,3-butanedione (15 mm for 20 min), pelleted by centrifugation, and washed twice in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) before activity measurements as above. The primary model for our calculations was the x-ray structure of the human GlcAT-I bound to UDP and substrate refined at 2.3 Å (17Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Modeling and docking of substrates were carried out with SCULPT version 3.0 (Molecular Designs, Ltd., San Leandro, CA) (28Surles M.C. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Brooks F.P., Jr. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), mutagenesis with S-PDB Viewer molecular graphics (29Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9588) Google Scholar), and protein analysis using RASMOL v.2.7.1.1 (30Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). The software was run on a PC. Docking experiments were conducted following three steps: (i) binding of substrates by tethering UDP part to UDP template of the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1FGG) and then relaxing the substrate to minimize global free energy (all backbone and side chains were kept frozen); (ii) tethering off and deleting template UDP to determine lowest energy conformations for the substrate; and (iii) thawing side chains of residues in contact with the substrate for a last energy minimization run, keeping both Gal residues of the acceptor substrate frozen. This overall process was repeated 20 independent times for each complex studied. The specificity of the recombinant GlcAT-I toward the UDP sugar donor substrate was analyzed using a series of analogs of UDP-GlcA, UDP-GalA, UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-Man, and UDP-GlcNAc (Fig.1 A). Chromatograms of the HPLC resolution of the enzymatic reaction product formed with UDP-GlcA (chromatogram 1, peak b) or UDP-GalA (chromatogram 2, peak b) as co-substrate are illustrated in Fig. 1 B. No detectable product was observed when incubation was performed in the absence of donor substrate (Fig.1 B, chromatogram 3) or after treatment by β-glucuronidase (data not shown). As expected, the recombinant wild-type enzyme exhibited the highest activity toward UDP-GlcA reaching about 70 pmol·min−1·mg−1 protein in the membrane fraction of recombinant yeast cells (Fig.1 A, column a). Interestingly, GlcAT-I was also able to efficiently catalyze the transfer of GalA from UDP-GalA onto the acceptor digalactose substrate. The activity toward UDP-GalA was about 35 pmol·min−1·mg−1 protein (Fig.1 A, column b). By contrast, the other nucleotide sugars tested (UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-Man, and UDP-GlcNAc) (Fig.1 A, columns c–f, respectively) were not substrates of the recombinant GlcAT-I. The membrane fraction of yeast cells transformed with a nonrecombinant plasmid, used as a control, did not exhibit any detectable activity toward all of the UDP-sugars tested (data not shown). It thus appears that the presence of a carboxyl group on C-6 of the carbohydrate moiety of the UDP sugar (i.e. UDP-GlcA, UDP-GalA) was a determinant for the donor substrate to accommodate the binding site of GlcAT-I. Interestingly, the fact that UDP-GalA was an alternative donor substrate of GlcAT-I suggested that the active site of the enzyme can accommodate the carbohydrate ring with C-4 hydroxyl in α and β configuration as long as it contains a carboxylate group at C-6 position. The x-ray structure of the catalytic domain of GlcAT-I bound to UDP and acceptor substrate has been recently solved (17Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Analysis of the three-dimensional structure revealed that the histidine at position 308 is close to the β-phosphate of UDP and to the O-3 hydroxyl of the terminal galactose, suggesting the possibility that this residue is part of the active site. In addition, His308 is in a remarkably conserved WH308TRT motif located at the C-terminal end of the GlcAT protein family. We therefore investigated the role of His308 by alanine and arginine substitution to assess the contribution of the size of the side chain of the amino acid and the presence of nitrogen, respectively. Upon expression of the mutants inP. pastoris, similar amounts of wild-type and mutant proteins were produced (data not shown). Replacement of the His308 residue by alanine abrogated the activity of GlcAT-I toward UDP-GlcA, indicating that this histidine residue is crucial for enzyme activity (Fig. 2 A,column a). The H308A mutant was not active toward any of the co-substrate analogs UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-Man, or UDP-GlcNAc tested (columns b to e, respectively). Interestingly, replacement of the His308 residue by an arginine induced a major change on the GT specificity of the GlcAT-I enzyme. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the H308R mutant was able to efficiently transfer Glc from UDP-Glc onto the acceptor substrate Gal-Gal as evidenced by the HPLC profile presented in Fig. 2 B(chromatogram 1, peak b). The structure of the reaction product was further confirmed by digestion with β-glucosidase (not shown). The activity toward UDP-Glc was up to 40 pmol·min−1·mg protein−1 (Fig.2 A, column g). The H308R mutant remained able to catalyze the transfer of GlcA from UDP-GlcA onto the acceptor substrate as evidenced by HPLC analysis (Fig. 2 B, chromatogram 2, peak b) but with a 3.5-fold lower activity compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2 A, column f). UDP-GlcNAc was used by the mutant at about the same rate as UDP-Glc (Fig. 2 A, column j), whereas UDP-Gal was a weak donor substrate in the transfer reaction (Fig. 2 A,column h). Furthermore, UDP-Man was efficiently used as co-substrate (Fig. 2 A, column i), whereas no activity could be detected in the membrane fraction of recombinant yeast cells expressing H308R with GDP-Man as a donor substrate. To provide further information on the functional consequences of the histidine substitution by arginine, we compared the kinetic properties of the H308R mutant with those of the wild-type enzyme. The values obtained by Lineweaver-Burk plots are summarized in TableI. As expected from the data reported above, the efficiency of the H308R mutant toward UDP-GlcA estimated by the V max/K m ratio was substantially reduced (2.4-fold) compared with the wild-type enzyme because of a decrease in the apparent V maxvalue. In addition, the H308R mutant enzyme displayed significant GT activities toward UDP-Glc, UDP-Man, and UDP-GlcNAc, withV max values in the same range. However, compared with UDP-GlcA, the K m values were 5- and 2-fold higher in the case of UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc, respectively.Table IKinetic analysis of wild-type GlcAT-I and H308R mutantSubstrateWild-type GlcAT-IH308R GlcAT-I V max K m V max/K m V max K m V max/K m pmol·min −1 ·mgP −1 μm l·min −1 ·mgP −1 pmol·min −1 ·mgP −1 μm lmin −1 ·mgP −1UDP-GlcA68.0359.241.1523.7849.940.48UDP-GlcNDNDND35.63232.760.15UDP-ManNDNDND35.1873.840.47UDP-GalNDNDND−−−UDP-GlcNAcNDNDND26.43108.250.24Apparent kinetic constants of the wild-type and H308R mutant enzymes were determined in the membrane fraction of recombinant yeast cells toward various UDP-sugars by varying the concentration of the donor substrates (0.025–2 mm), whereas the concentration of the acceptor substrate Gal-Gal was kept constant (1 mm).

The promiscuity of activator/HAT interactions suggests that additional factors temporally regulate these interactions in response to signaling pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that the negative regulator, Gal80, blocks interactions between the SAGA and NuA4 HAT complexes and the Gal4 activator. By contrast, Gal80 did not inhibit SAGA and NuA4 interaction with another activator Gcn4. The function of Gal80 prevented Gal4 targeting of SAGA and displaced SAGA targeted by Gal4 to a promoter within a nucleosome array. In the same set of experiments, targeting of SAGA by Gcn4 was unaffected by Gal80. These studies demonstrate that the specificity of HAT/activator interactions can be dictated by cofactors that modulate activation domain function in response to cellular signals.

In eukaryotes, regulation of transcription preinitiation occurs at multiple levels (1Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). At the very least, this regulation involves the modification of chromatin (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar, 3Vignali M. Hassan A.H.

Regulation at this level is primarily the direct result of activator and repressor proteins that bind DNA and target cellular factors to promoters. It now appears that many of these targeted factors participate in both the modification of chromatin and regulating the establishment of PICs (7Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). One of these factors, the yeast SAGA complex, functions as a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) (8Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L.

Several components of SAGA have been shown to interact with activators, including Ada2 (19Berger S.L. Pina B. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Agapite J. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Guarente L. Cell. 1992; 70: 251-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 20Barlev N.A. Candau R. Wang L. Darpino P. Silverman N. Berger S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19337-19344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), several TAFs (21Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and Tra1 (22Brown C.E. Howe L. Sousa K. Alley S.C. Carrozza M.J. Tan S. Workman J.L. Science. 2001; 292: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the yeast NuA4 HAT complex also contains Tra1 (23Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Cote J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and is targeted by activators (18Vignali M. Steger D.J. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic characterization of Tra1 has found that this factor when present within SAGA and NuA4 is contacted by activators and appears to play a crucial role in the activity of these complexes (22Brown C.E. Howe L. Sousa K. Alley S.C. Carrozza M.J. Tan S. Workman J.L. Science. 2001; 292: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, Tra1 appears to be a mutual interface for activator interaction with SAGA and NuA4. These observations have made it evident that both SAGA and NuA4 can be targeted to promoters by activators. However, if the interactions between these HATs and activators are related to the regulation of transcription, we would expect them to be modulated by signals controlling gene-specific transcription. To address this possibility, we turned to one of the most widely studied pathways for gene-specific transcription regulation in eukaryotes, the yeast Gal4-Gal80-Gal3 transcription switch, which regulates the expression of galactose-responsive (GAL) genes (24Johnston M. Carlson M. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar, 25Bhat P.J. Murthy T.V. Mol.

The Gal4 activator is responsible for the activation of genes encoding for enzymes necessary for utilizing galactose as an alternative carbon source. Typical of many activators, Gal4 recognizes DNA in a sequence-specific manner through its DNA-binding domain located within amino acids 1–65 (27Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Once bound to promoters, the Gal4 activation domains, located within amino acids 148–238 and 768–881 (28Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), contact and target general transcription components to the promoter (29Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 30Wu Y. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Under growth conditions containing glucose, the Gal4 activator binds promoters at very low levels. When cells are grown in other carbon sources, Gal4 binds constitutively to GAL promoters. Although bound to promoters, Gal4 only activates transcription in the presence of galactose (24Johnston M. Carlson M. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 193-281Google Scholar, 26Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A combination of biochemical and genetic approaches have established that in the absence of galactose the repressor protein Gal80 is targeted to GAL promoters through direct interaction within amino acids 850–871 of the Gal4 C-terminal activation domain (31Johnston S.A. Salmeron J.M., Jr. Dincher S.S. Cell. 1987; 50: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Dickson R.C. Gerardot C.J. Martin A.K.

Through this interaction, Gal80 is believed to block the ability of Gal4 to contact other transcription components (39Ansari A.Z. Reece R.J. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Platt A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the presence of galactose, the block imposed on activation by Gal80 is alleviated by a third factor, Gal3 (25Bhat P.J. Murthy T.V. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying Gal3 alleviation of Gal80 inhibition remains unclear. In one case, in vitro transcription and DNA-binding experiments have demonstrated that Gal3 alleviates this inhibition by directly associating with a Gal4-Gal80 promoter complex (40Platt A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, another study using a Gal3-green fluorescent protein fusion protein found that Gal3 was primarily localized within the cytoplasm (41Peng G. Hopper J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5140-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear how Gal3, if localized in the cytoplasm, would be able to associate with a Gal4-Gal80 promoter within the nucleus. Recent genetic studies have identified a role for SAGA in the expression of GAL genes. These studies have shown that the expression of GAL1 is significantly reduced in cells with defects in the SAGA components Spt3 or Spt20 (10Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Dudley A.M. Rougeulle C. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, in cells defective in the Gcn5 catalytic HAT subunit of SAGA,GAL1 expression was less affected. These results indicate that SAGA is required for the transcription of GAL genes and provides functions beyond histone acetyltransferase activity. In this study, we demonstrate direct interactions between the Gal4 activator and SAGA. Moreover, the Gal80 protein specifically regulates these interactions with the Gal4 activation domain. These results demonstrate that cofactors that regulate the activity of activation domains in yeast can do so by bringing specificity to activator/HAT interactions. SAGA and ADA HAT complexes with a C-terminal HA-tagged Ada2 subunit were isolated from the yeast strain CY947 bearing the plasmid Ycp88-HA-ADA2 (42Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SAGA was also isolated from the yeast strain YJW526, which is a Δtra1strain with an N-terminal FLAG-tagged TRA1 centromeric plasmid and the plasmid Ycp88-HA-ADA2. NuA4 complex was isolated from strain YJW207, which contains three tandem HA tags at the C terminus of the endogenous Esa1. The Gal4-Gcn4AD protein was expressed from pG4Gcn4 that contains the Gcn4 sequences encoding amino acids 9–172 fused to the C-terminal end of the Gal4 DNA binding region (aa 1–93) in pRJR1 (43Reece R.J. Rickles R.J. Ptashne M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SAGA, ADA, NuA4 HAT complexes were isolated as described previously (44Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods. 1998; 15: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SAGA was also purified by fractionating whole cell extract containing FLAG-tagged Tra1 over Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and MonoQ (AP Biotech) as described by Eberharter et al. (44Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods. 1998; 15: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), followed by batch immunoaffinity purification on anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma). Peak SAGA MonoQ fractions were bound to anti-FLAG beads in 0.35m NaCl buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). Beads were washed sequentially in 350 mm NaCl buffer B and 150 mm NaCl buffer B. SAGA was eluted from beads with 1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in 150 mm NaCl buffer B. Fractions from all columns were monitored by assaying for HAT activity (44Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 126: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Gal80 was overexpressed in yeast w303–1abearing the plasmid pAP77 and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described by Platt and Reece (40Platt A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). HAT complexes were precleared on glutathione-Sepharose (AP Biotech) in 150 mm NaCl buffer PD (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). Approximately 0.3 pmol of precleared HAT was added to 0.5 nmol of GST, GST-Gal4AD, or GST-Gcn4-Sepharose preequilibrated in 150 mm NaCl PD buffer and mixed overnight at 4 °C. After several washes in 150 mm NaCl PD buffer, portions of input, supernatants, and equivalent volumes of beads were analyzed for complex subunits by Western blot and HAT activity. For Western blot, anti-HA was used to detect the Ada2-HA subunit in SAGA and ADA and the Esa1-HA subunit in NuA4. For the analysis of HAT activity, samples were mixed into standard HAT reactions (44Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Methods. 1998; 15: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), run on 15% SDS gels, and subjected to fluorography. GST-Gal4AD and GST-Gcn4AD complexes were treated with Gal80 by mixing 2.5 nmol of Gal80 with 0.5 nmol of GST-Gal4AD or GST-Gcn4-Sepharose in 150 mm NaCl buffer PD for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by several washes in 150 mm NaCl PD buffer. Pull-down experiments with HATs were then carried out as described above. Nucleosome arrays were reconstituted in vitro by salt step dilution (47Steger D.J. Workman J.L. Methods. 1999; 19: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and immobilized on magnetic beads (Dynal) (48Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12924-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 49Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The template consisted of a DNA fragment containing five sea urchin 5 S rRNA gene nucleosome-positioning sequences on each side of an adenovirus E4 core promoter with five upstream Gal4 DNA-binding sites (16Ikeda K. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). 0.5 pmol of Gal4(1–93 + 771–881) or Gal4-Gcn4 were mixed with 2.5 pmol of Gal80 and template beads containing 0.3 pmol of Gal4 binding sites in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 5% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with occasional agitation. Beads were collected on a magnetic concentrator (Dynal) and washed in binding buffer. Next, 1 μg of competitor HeLa oligonucleosomes (50Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Steger D.J. West J.M. John S. Cote J. Havas K.M. Workman J.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 319-331PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.2 pmol of SAGA were added to the binding reactions and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with occasional agitation. Following another series of washes in binding buffer, reactions were run on 10% SDS gels and analyzed for SAGA by anti-HA Western blot for Ada2-HA. In the experiment testing for Gal80 displacement of targeted SAGA, Gal4 or Gcn4 was mixed with template beads as described above. Competitor chromatin and SAGA were then added and incubated with the template beads as described. Next, 1 pmol of Gal80 was added to the template beads and incubated for 1h at 30 °C. Samples were then washed in binding buffer and analyzed for SAGA by anti-HA Western blot for Ada2-HA. To establish the Gal4-Gal80 regulatory switch as a model for studying the specificity of HAT interaction with activators, SAGA and NuA4 were tested for their ability to interact with the Gal4 activation domain (AD) (aa 768–881) in GST pull-down experiments. The yeast ADA HAT complex was included as a negative control, since this complex does not interact with activators (17Utley R.T. Ikeda K. Grant P.A. Cote J. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Workman J.L. Nature. 1998; 394: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). GST and GST-Gal4AD fusion proteins cross-linked to glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with highly fractionated SAGA, NuA4, and ADA. Western analysis in Fig.1 A of pull-down samples for SAGA, detected through its subunit Ada2, and NuA4, detected through its catalytic subunit Esa1, shows that both SAGA (top panel) and NuA4 (middle panel) bind the Gal4AD (compare lanes 4 and 5). As expected, the bulk of the Ada2 signal from the ADA complex remained unbound (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel, compare lanes 4 and 5), indicating that this complex did not interact with the Gal4AD. Further demonstration of binding to the Gal4AD was obtained from the HAT activity present in the pull-down samples. Fluorograms of HAT reactions with pull-down samples in Fig. 1 B show that the bulk of SAGA histone H3 acetylation (top panel,lanes 4 and 5) and NuA4 histone H4 acetylation (middle panel, lanes 4 and 5) binds GST-Gal4AD, whereas the histone H3 acetylation carried out by the ADA complex (bottom panel, lanes 4 and 5) remains unbound. Based on these results, we concluded that that the Gal4AD has high affinity for the SAGA and NuA4 HAT complexes. We next determined whether Gal80 affected the interaction of SAGA or NuA4 with the Gal4AD. This was tested by preincubating GST-Gal4AD beads with Gal80, followed by several washes. The Coomassie stain gel in Fig. 2 A,lane 3, demonstrates that Gal80 binds GST-Gal4AD beads. Pull-down experiments were performed by incubating SAGA and NuA4 with normalized amounts of GST, GST-Gal4AD, or GST-Gal4AD beads pretreated with Gal80. In the absence of Gal80, SAGA bound the Gal4AD (Fig. 2 B, top panel, lane 5). By contrast, when SAGA binding was tested using the Gal4AD beads treated with Gal80, SAGA binding was reduced to background levels (Fig. 2 B, top panel,lane 7), indicating that Gal80 blocks SAGA interaction with the Gal4AD. The presence of Gal80 in these samples is indicated on the Coomassie-stained gel containing a portion of each pull-down sample (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel, lane 7). Gal80 also blocked the binding of NuA4 to the Gal4AD as indicated by the elimination of Esa1 in sample treated with Gal80 (Fig. 2 C, comparelanes 5 and 7). The specificity of Gal80 inhibition was determined by testing the effect of Gal80 on HAT interaction with the Gcn4AD. This activator is responsible for activation of amino acid biosynthetic genes in yeast and is known to target SAGA to these genes (9Belotserkovskaya R. Sterner D.E. Deng M. Sayre M.H. Lieberman P.M. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 51Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). However, Gcn4 is regulated at the translation level (52Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and should not be affected by Gal80. Both SAGA and NuA4 exhibit efficient binding to the Gcn4AD (Fig.2, A and B, top panels,lane 9). Interestingly, Gal80 also bound the Gcn4AD beads (bottom panels, lanes 11) but was unable to block SAGA and NuA4 binding to the Gcn4AD (top panels, lane 11). The presence of Gal80 in the Gal4AD and Gcn4AD pull-downs appears to be a function of the activation domains, since GST alone did not pull down Gal80 (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that the Gal80 confers a specific inhibition of the Gal4 activator interaction with SAGA and NuA4. To further examine the functional relevance of Gal80 to SAGA function, we tested whether Gal80 would inhibit Gal4-dependent targeting of SAGA to a chromatin promoterin vitro. This provides a more physiological context, since potential interactions between the HAT complex and the template chromatin might affect the ability of Gal80 to block HAT complex recruitment to promoter nucleosomes. In addition, we focused on SAGA for these experiments, since it appears to be the most important HAT complex for activation of Gal4-driven genes in vivo. Activation of GAL genes in vivo is dependent on SAGA (10Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Dudley A.M. Rougeulle C. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that SAGA is recruited to GAL promoters as a function of galactose induction (12Larschan E. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1946-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). However, Esa1, the catalytic subunit of NuA4, has not been observed to cross-link on GALpromoters in vivo (53Reid J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1297-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The nucleosome template used in these experiments consists of five sea urchin 5 S rRNA gene nucleosome-positioning sequences on each side of an adenovirus E4 core promoter with five upstream Gal4 DNA-binding sites (Fig. 3 A) (16Ikeda K. Steger D.J. Eberharter A. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The DNA template was reconstituted into nucleosomes in vitro using salt step dilution with purified histones (47Steger D.J. Workman J.L. Methods. 1999; 19: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Once reconstituted, the array was immobilized on streptavidin magnetic beads through a biotinylated nucleotide at the 3′-end (48Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12924-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 49Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Targeting experiments were performed by first prebinding the template with Gal4(1–93 + 768–881) (40Platt A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and Gal80 and then washing on a magnetic concentrator to remove unbound protein (Fig. 3 A). This was followed by a targeting step with SAGA and competitor chromatin (49Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 817-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 50Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Steger D.J. West J.M. John S. Cote J. Havas K.M. Workman J.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 319-331PubMed Google Scholar) and another series of washes. Initial experiments determined that SAGA exhibited a high degree of binding to the immobilized nucleosome array by itself (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). However, with the addition of competitor chromatin, SAGA interaction with the template was lost (comparelanes 3 and 4). Under these competitive conditions, the presence of Gal4 resulted in specific targeting of SAGA to the template (Fig. 3 B, comparelanes 6 and 7). This result along with the direct interaction data in earlier figures indicates that the Gal4AD directly targets the SAGA to promoter chromatin in vitro. The addition of Gal80 reduced Gal4 targeting of SAGA to near background levels (Fig. 3, lane 8). Thus, Gal80 inhibition of SAGA interaction with Gal4 appears to be one mechanism for modulating activator targeting of SAGA. The specificity of Gal80 inhibition of SAGA targeting was also tested using the Gcn4AD (Fig. 4 A). To specify Gcn4 for this promoter, the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (aa 1–93) was fused to the Gcn4AD (aa 9–172). Again in Fig. 4 B, we demonstrate that Gal4 targets SAGA to a nucleosomal promoter (comparelanes 2 and 3), and Gal80 effectively reduces this targeting to background levels (lane 4). Gcn4 was also able to target SAGA to this promoter (compare lanes 2 and 5), but in this case Gal80 was unable to inhibit Gcn4 targeting of SAGA (lane 6). Thus, it appears that although both of these activators efficiently target SAGA, Gal80 inhibition of this targeting is specific to the Gal4AD. In vivo Gal80 is known to bind Gal4 and shut downGAL genes following the addition of glucose to cells grown in galactose (54Lamphier M.S. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5922-5926Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that coactivators targeted by Gal4 are displaced following this switch in carbon sources. Therefore, we next determined whether Gal80 was able to specifically displace Gal4-targeted SAGA from a nucleosome template (Fig.5 A). To address this possibility, SAGA was first targeted to the immobilized nucleosome with either Gal4 or Gcn4. Following this targeting step, Gal80 was added to activator targeted SAGA templates. Both Gal4 and Gcn4 exhibited efficient targeting of SAGA in the absence of Gal80 (Fig.5 B, lanes 3 and 5). However, when Gal80 is added following activator targeting, the Gal4-targeted SAGA is no longer bound to the template (lane 4), whereas the Gcn4-targeted SAGA remains bound (lane 6). Thus, reflective of Gal80-mediated glucose repression in vivo, Gal80 specifically displaces SAGA from Gal4-targeted templates. The results presented here illustrate a mechanism whereby HAT targeting by activators can be regulated by additional factors, such as Gal80, that restrict activation domain function. This mechanism is supported by genetic studies using cells with mutations in SAGA components. For instance, deletion of either the SPT20 orSPT3 gene, both known components of SAGA, has debilitating effects on GAL expression (10Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Dudley A.M. Rougeulle C. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that SAGA is recruited to GAL promoters as a function of galactose induction (12Larschan E. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1946-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and the Gal4AD (10Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Our results provide biochemical evidence that these observations are the result of Gal4 targeting of the SAGA complex through direct interaction. Genetic support for a Gal80 role in regulating Gal4 targeting of SAGA is garnered from an experiment testing the effect of anSPT20 disruption in the background of a GAL80disruption (10Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this experiment, the deletion of GAL80resulted in the expression of GAL genes under growth conditions where these genes are normally inactive. WhenSPT20 was disrupted in this gal80 mutant,GAL expression was suppressed. The results of this experiment suggest a relationship between components of SAGA and Gal80. Based on our findings, this relationship is probably the result of Gal80 inhibiting SAGA targeting by Gal4. Our results also provide important insight into the mechanisms that specify HAT complex interaction with activators. Both SAGA and NuA4 have been shown through biochemical approaches to contact a variety of yeast activator proteins (22Brown C.E. Howe L. Sousa K. Alley S.C. Carrozza M.J. Tan S. Workman J.L. Science. 2001; 292: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, the cell must provide mechanisms that specify the appropriate interaction under a particular growth condition. Here we show that coregulatory proteins, such as Gal80, can restrict the interaction between these HATs and Gal4, whereas under the same conditions, these complexes are still able to function with other yeast activators as shown with Gcn4 in this study. This scenario would allow other regulatory pathways, such as activation of amino acid biosynthetic genes by Gcn4, to continue unimpeded by Gal80. While it would be intellectually pleasing if yeast activation domains were found to interact specifically with distinct targets, the data argue that activation domains do not have the capacity to make these distinctions. Several activators have been shown to interact with the TFIID (21Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), Mediator (55Lee Y.C.

The fact that activation domains appear to have the ability to recruit several different complexes may allow alternative mechanisms to activate many genes in yeast and may account for synthetic phenotypes between components of these complexes (15Pollard K.J.

Since it is clear that many yeast activators occupy their target promoters prior to induction of the gene (13Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K.

Consistent with its presumed role as a transcriptional repressor, FAZF was found in the nuclear compartment, where it resides in distinct nuclear speckles at or near sites of DNA replication. Using a FAZF-inducible myeloid cell line, we found that enforced expression of FAZF was accompanied by accumulation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle followed later by apoptosis. These results suggest an essential role for FAZF during the proliferative stages of primitive hematopoietic progenitors, possibly acting in concert with (a subset of) the Fanconi anemia proteins.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19631-19639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), a new member of the BTB/POZ (pox virus and zinc finger) protein family, was identified based on its ability to interact with the Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation group C protein, FANCC (4Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FA is a genomic instability disorder characterized by progressive pancytopenia, diverse congenital anomalies, and predisposition to cancer, particularly acute myeloid leukemia and squamous cell carcinoma (for review, see Ref. 5Joenje H. Patel K.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Congenital malformations in FA are a striking feature of the disease. The most common are defects in the thumbs (e.g. absent, bifid, or hypoplastic thumb) (6De Kerviler E. Guermazi A. Zagdanski A.M. Gluckman E. Frija J. Clin. Radiol. 2000; 55: 340-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although abnormalities are variable and may involve any major organ system. The range and type of developmental defects observed suggest that FA genes are involved in morphogenesis. Cells from FA patients are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C. In addition, FA cells have an abnormal cell cycle profile, and this abnormality is exacerbated by treatment with mitomycin C (7Haneline L.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Cooper S. Hangoc G. Carreau M. Buchwald M. Clapp D.W. Blood. 1998; 91: 4092-4098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD34+ cells isolated from FA-C patients fail to thrive in vitro (8Walsh C.E. Nienhuis A.W. Samulski R.J. Brown M.G. Miller J.L.

Blood. 1994; 84: 453-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and treating normal CD34+ cells with antisense oligodinucleotides directed against the FANCC gene recapitulates the defective phenotype (10Segal G.M. Magenis R.E. Brown M. Keeble W. Smith T.D. Heinrich M.C. Bagby G.C., Jr. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results suggest that FA genes are involved in ensuring the proper growth and differentiation of primitive hematopoietic cells. Despite efforts to discover the function of the FANCC protein and the function of the proteins encoded by the other more recently cloned FA genes (FANCA, FANCD2,FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG), the basic defect is still unknown (11Timmers C. Taniguchi T. Hejna J. Reifsteck C. Lucas L. Bruun D. Thayer M. Cox B. Olson S. D'Andrea A.D. Moses R. Grompe M. Mol Cell. 2001; 7: 241-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that several FA proteins functionally interact within a large protein complex, and recent experiments demonstrated that the Fanconi anemia protein FANCD2 is coupled to a DNA damage response pathway involving BRCA1 (12Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). We reported previously that FAZF is a transcriptional repressor belonging to the BTB/POZ family of proteins and is similar to the PLZF protein (4Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLZF is involved in reciprocal chromosomal translocations with the retinoic acid receptor α leading to a form of acute promyelocytic leukemia (for review, see Melnick and Licht (13Melnick A. Licht J. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). PLZF is a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor that functions by interacting with co-repressor complexes including HDAC1. Enforced expression of PLZF in the murine hematopoietic cell line 32Dcl3 blocks cells in G1/S phase, inhibits cell growth and differentiation, and leads to apoptosis (14Shaknovich R. Yeyati P.L. Ivins S. Melnick A. Lempert C. Waxman S. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5533-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Experiments with PLZF nullizygous mice showed that it is essential for axial skeleton patterning and normal limb development (15Barna M. Hawe N. Niswander L. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). There are many unanswered questions regarding the function of FAZF in hematopoiesis and its relationship to the pathogenesis of FA, including its expression profile and its effects on growth and differentiation in hematopoietic cells. In the present study, we show that FAZF mRNA and protein are expressed in primary hematopoietic CD34+progenitor cells, increase during early proliferation, and are then down-regulated during terminal differentiation in both erythroid and myeloid lineages. The pattern is similar but not identical with that of PLZF. Further analysis using a FAZF-inducible hematopoietic cell line demonstrated that enforced expression of FAZF triggers a G1phase cell cycle arrest followed by increased apoptosis. Thus, our data suggest that FAZF influences hematopoietic cell fate, and its effects are conditional, depending on the proliferation/differentiation status of the cell. The pFLAG-FAZF expression plasmid and 293-EBNA/FLAG-FAZF cell line have been described (4Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FAZF-specific antibodies were prepared using a FAZF-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein as an antigen, essentially as described previously (16Hoatlin M.E. Kew O.M. Renz M.E. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glutathioneS-transferase-FAZF expression plasmid was constructed by inserting an internal XhoI-BamHI fragment from FAZF cDNA, encoding amino acid residues 114–295 of the FAZF protein, into an XhoI-BamHI-cut pGEX-5x-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). U937T/FAZF cells, a line of U937 cells stably expressing FAZF and the autoregulatory tet-VP16 under the control of the tet-operator promoter (17Boer J. Bonten-Surtel J. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 μg/ml puromycin, and 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline in 5% CO2. Recombinant human Epo was purchased from Amgen Corp. (Thousand Oaks, CA) and used at 1 unit/ml. Recombinant human SLF and granulocyte-CSF were purchased from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) and used at 50 and 10 ng/ml, respectively. Recombinant human GM-CSF and IL-3 were gifts from Immunex Corp. (Seattle, WA) and used at 200 units/ml each. Monoclonal mouse anti-PLZF antibody was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). All other antibodies and chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Tetracycline-inducible FLAG-tagged FAZF cell lines were produced using the Tet-off system (18Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). Briefly, an EcoRI/BglII fragment containing FAZF cDNA was obtained from pSG5-FAZF (4Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into pUHD10–3 cut with EcoRI and BamHI (18Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). For each transfection 2 × 107 U937T cells were washed once and resuspended in 400 μl of additive-free RPMI 1640. Ten micrograms of pUHD:FAZF and 1 μg of pIND (Invitrogen), as a neomycin selection marker, were linearized and co-transfected by electroporation at 960 microfarads and 0.17 kV using a Bio-Rad electroporator. After 24 h cells were plated into methylcellulose containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline, and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin with 1 mg/ml G418. Resistant clones were isolated and analyzed for FAZF expression. Growth of triplicate cultures of U937 cells was measured by the metabolic conversion of tetrazolium to formazan (CellTiter 96 Proliferation Assay, Promega). Mononuclear cells were obtained using Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation from normal human umbilical cord blood. CD34+ cells were isolated with magnetic-activated cell separation beads (Miltenyi Biotech Inc., Auburn, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The purification method routinely gave CD34+ cells that were more than 80–95% pure, as previously described (19Dai M.S. Mantel C.R. Xia Z.B. Broxmeyer H.E. Lu L. Blood. 2000; 96: 3985-3987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lu L. Heinrich M.C. Wang L.S. Dai M.S. Zigler A.J. Chai L. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1999; 94: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD34+ cells were cultured either in suspension culture or semi-solid culture for differentiation as previously described (19Dai M.S. Mantel C.R. Xia Z.B. Broxmeyer H.E. Lu L. Blood. 2000; 96: 3985-3987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lu L. Heinrich M.C. Wang L.S. Dai M.S. Zigler A.J. Chai L. Broxmeyer H.E.

Blood. 1998; 92: 443-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 cells/ml were seeded in semisolid cultures contained Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen), 1% methylcellulose, 30% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mmol/liter hemin (Eastman Kodak Co.), 2 mmol/literl-glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol, 200 units/ml granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, 200 units/ml IL-3, 50 ng/ml SLF, 1 units/ml Epo, 10 μg/ml vitamin B12, 15 μg/ml folic acid, 10 μg/ml insulin. For erythroid differentiation in suspension culture, CD34+cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum in the presence of IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, SLF, and Epo. For myeloid differentiation, CD34+ cells were cultured either in suspension or methylcellulose culture for CFU-granulocyte macrophage as for erythroid cultures except with the addition of 10 ng/ml granulocyte-CSF in lieu of Epo. Total RNA was isolated from freshly separated CD34+ cells (d0) or differentiated cells in both erythroid and myeloid lineages at different time courses (d3-d14) by Qiagen RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as suggested by the manufacturer. Total RNA was treated with DNase I for 15 min at room temperature followed by heating at 95 °C for 10 min before reverse transcription to eliminate any contamination of remaining genomic DNA. PCR was performed by a thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sequences of primers are as follows: FAZF, 5′-GAG ATG TTG CAC AAG CAC TCG C-3′, 5′-CAA CTG GTT CTG GCT CCA GAG C-3′; PLZF, 5′-GAA GCA TTC CAG CGA GGA GA-3′, 5′-GGA GTA GAT GGC CAG ATG CT-3′. The primers for β-actin was described previously (20Lu L. Heinrich M.C. Wang L.S. Dai M.S. Zigler A.J. Chai L. Broxmeyer H.E. Blood. 1999; 94: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR profile used was denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 52–55 °C for 45 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. Ten μl of amplification reaction was electrophoresed, transferred to membrane, and hybridized with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences)-labeled FAZF, PLZF, or β-actin gene fragment as a probe. Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 °C, filters were washed with 0.1 × SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 mNaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 60 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray at −70 °C. Whole cell lysates were prepared by suspending cells at a concentration of 2 × 107cells/ml in cell lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.4, 0.25 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 mmol/liter NaF). Protein in the clear lysate was quantitated using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and incubated with mouse or rabbit antibodies specific for PLZF, FAZF, FLAG M2, or actin, as noted in text, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected with the ECL-Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 plus 1% fetal calf serum and incubated for 1–7 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 70% cold ethanol at −20 °C, washed twice in PBS, and incubated in 50 μg/ml RNase A and 20 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min at 37 °C. The cell cycle status was detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter flow cytometry and analyzed using CellFit software (BD PharMingen). Apoptosis was determined using annexin V staining. Briefly, cells were incubated with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 15 min at room temperature, then suspended in binding buffer containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide followed by flow cytometry analysis. For FAZF expression in 293 EBNA cells (Invitrogen), cells were seeded on chamber slides and transfected using LipofectAMINE as directed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Plasmids encoding epitope-tagged FAZF or the parental vectors as negative controls for antibody specificity were used as indicated in text. Cells were processed as described previously (4Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and/or rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-mouse and/or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as secondary antibodies. For analysis of CD34+ cells, cells were placed on chamber slides pretreated with poly-lysine. Sites of DNA synthesis were determined by a 2-bromo-2′-deoxy-uridine (BrdUrd)-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm BrdUrd for 4.5 h, permeabilized, and fixed with 70% ethanol in a 50 mm glycine buffer, pH 2.0. Cells were incubated with rabbit FAZF-specific antisera followed by Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes). BrdUrd incorporation was visualized with an anti-BrdUrd mouse monoclonal antibody followed by a fluorescein-labeled secondary antibody. Image collection and manipulation for overlapping signals were performed as described previously (4Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular localization of FAZF we generated FAZF-specific antibodies using a glutathioneS-transferase-FAZF fusion protein as an antigen. An internal domain of FAZF with only 14% identity to PLZF was selected to reduce potential cross-reactivity with PLZF and other BTB/POZ proteins. To demonstrate that the antibody recognizes FAZF, we examined lysates from 293 EBNA cells transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged FAZF (293/Fl-FAZF) or the parental plasmid (control) by immunoblot. As shown in Fig1 A, the antibody recognizes FAZF, and no signal was observed in negative control lysates. Reprobing the blot with anti-FLAG detected a band overlapping with that recognized by anti-FAZF (Fig 1 B). In immunofluorescence assays using 293/Fl-FAZF cells, preimmune serum lacked specific staining (Fig 1 C), whereas FAZF-specific antiserum demonstrated that FAZF is localized in the nucleus of 293/Fl-FAZF cells in speckles in a range of sizes from micropunctate to large foci (Fig1 D). The staining is indistinguishable from that using an anti-FLAG antibody that recognizes the epitope-tagged FAZF (4Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that our antibody recognizes FAZF in both immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays. To determine the expression pattern of endogenously expressed FAZF, CD34 + cells were isolated from human cord blood and grown in the presence of growth factors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were fixed and stained with anti-FAZF and examined by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig2, FAZF is expressed in the nucleus in a speckled pattern, consistent with the pattern observed in 293 cells overexpressing the FLAG epitope-tagged FAZF (4Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The speckled pattern is similar to that observed for other BTB/POZ-containing proteins including the related proteins, PLZF (23Reid A. Gould A. Brand N. Cook M. Strutt P., Li, J. Licht J. Waxman S. Krumlauf R. Zelent A. Blood. 1995; 86: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and BCL6 (also known as LAZ3) (24Albagli O. Lantoine D. Quief S. Quignon F. Englert C. Kerckaert J.P. Montarras D. Pinset C. Lindon C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5063-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Albagli O. Lindon C. Lantoine D. Quief S. Puvion E. Pinset C. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8560-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The significance of the nuclear speckled pattern observed for certain BTB/POZ-containing proteins is unknown. However, recent experiments with BCL6 by Albagli et al. (25Albagli O. Lindon C. Lantoine D. Quief S. Puvion E. Pinset C. Puvion-Dutilleul F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8560-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) demonstrate a close association of BCL6 and replication foci, suggesting that BCL6 may have a positioning or assembly role in replication. To test the possibility that FAZF associates with sites of DNA synthesis, we examined CD34+ cells that were grown in the presence of erythroid factors for 5 days by pulse-labeling the sites of DNA synthesis with BrdUrd. Stained cells were examined by confocal microscopy. Fig 3 shows that FAZF and BrdUrd labeling occur in foci and that these foci are often adjacent or overlapping, suggesting that FAZF is localized near sites of DNA replication. To begin to define the role of FAZF in hematopoiesis, we determined the expression of FAZF during early proliferation and terminal differentiation stages of CD34+ progenitor cells directed to either erythroid or myeloid lineages by the presence of SLF, IL-3, granulocyte, macrophage-CSF, plus Epo (for erythroid) or granulocyte-CSF (for myeloid). The day-7–14 BFU-E (burst-forming unit-erythrocyte)-derived cells were described (19Dai M.S. Mantel C.R. Xia Z.B. Broxmeyer H.E. Lu L. Blood. 2000; 96: 3985-3987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CFU-granulocyte macrophage-derived cells expressed myeloid lineage markers such as CD11b/CD14 by flow cytometry analysis (data not shown). The day-3 and -5 suspension culture-derived cells for both erythroid and myeloid lineages can form secondary CFU-erythrocyte and CFU-granulocyte macrophage colonies (data not shown), indicating that the cells differentiate to specific erythroid or myeloid lineages under these culture conditions. The expression of FAZF was compared with that of PLZF, the closest hematopoietic counterpart to FAZF. Cell samples collected at days 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 were assayed for FAZF or PLZF protein by immunoblot using anti-actin as a control for protein loading. Transcripts from corresponding samples were also analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4 A, PLZF mRNA was expressed in CD34+ progenitor cells at a high level, consistent with previous reports (14Shaknovich R. Yeyati P.L. Ivins S. Melnick A. Lempert C. Waxman S. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5533-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23Reid A. Gould A. Brand N. Cook M. Strutt P., Li, J. Licht J. Waxman S. Krumlauf R. Zelent A. Blood. 1995; 86: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLZF was expressed during both early proliferation (before day 7) and terminal differentiation (after day 7) stages in both erythroid and myeloid lineages. No differences in expression were observed between lineages. In contrast, FAZF was expressed in CD34+ progenitor cells at a lower level relative to PLZF, which remained at high levels during early proliferation but was down-regulated during terminal differentiation in both lineages. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the expression of both FAZF and PLZF proteins is high before day 7 and decreases during terminal differentiation stages, suggesting that PLZF but not FAZF is regulated at the post-transcriptional level during hematopoiesisin vitro. These results suggest that down-regulation of both PLZF and FAZF is required for the proper differentiation of both erythroid and myeloid lineages. We anticipated difficulty in directly assessing the biological function of FAZF by expressing the protein in cells because FAZF is similar to other proteins that negatively regulate growth. Thus, to complement the results obtained in primary cells and to examine the possible growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of FAZF in hematopoietic cells, we used a tetracycline-regulated expression system. A parental U937T cell line constructed to constitutively express the tetracycline repressor (17Boer J. Bonten-Surtel J. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was transfected with a FAZF construct under the control of the TET operator, and individual clones were isolated. Expression of FAZF upon tetracycline withdrawal was assessed in each independent clone by immunoblot with an anti-FAZF polyclonal antibody followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. We selected two clones with tight regulation and high expression levels termed U937T/FAZF-6 and -30, respectively (Fig5 A). A cell line that was neomycin-resistant but did not produce FAZF as detected by immunoblot (U937T/NEO) was used as a negative control in all experiments. The growth rate, viability, and cell cycle profile before and after tetracycline withdrawal of the control U937T/NEO cell line was indistinguishable from the parental line U937T. In contrast, cultures of U937T/FAZF cell clones were significantly growth-suppressed upon withdrawal of tetracycline as shown in Fig 5 B. BCL6 and PLZF, related BTB/POZ-containing proteins, can mediate apoptosis (14Shaknovich R. Yeyati P.L. Ivins S. Melnick A. Lempert C. Waxman S. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5533-5545Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,24Albagli O. Lantoine D. Quief S. Quignon F. Englert C. Kerckaert J.P. Montarras D. Pinset C. Lindon C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5063-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether FAZF triggers apoptosis, we tested the U937T/FAZF-inducible cell lines before and after FAZF expression. Apoptosis was demonstrated by an annexin V staining assay, which is a sensitive method for detection of cells in pre-apoptosis. We measured annexin V staining and propidium iodide staining over time in control cells and in cells induced to express FAZF. Annexin V staining labels cells that are undergoing apoptosis, whereas propidium iodide staining labels cells that have undergone sufficient programmed cell death that they become permeable to this nucleic acid stain. Thus, apoptotic cells bind annexin V and later become stained with propidium iodide. In cells where FAZF is not expressed, the population of annexin V-positive cells ranged from 3.7 to 6.1% over a 5-day period, and propidium iodide staining cells increased over this time period from 1.7 to 3.3% of the population (Fig 6). In contrast, cells with induced FAZF expression exhibit a significant increase in annexin V-positive cells during this time, and at day 7 post-induction, 32.8% of the population was stained in this representative experiment. A concomitant increase in cells stained by propidium iodide was observed, reaching 13% at day 7. We conclude that enforced FAZF expression in U937T/FAZF cells induces apoptosis. The combination of growth suppression and apoptosis led us to examine the cell cycle profiles in FAZF-expressing cells. U937/FAZF clones 6 and 30 were followed for 7 days after induction of FAZF expression. In the parental control cells and in FAZF clones in the presence of tetracycline (no FAZF expression), the cell cycle profile included ∼60% of cells in G1 and ∼20% in each of the S and G2/M phases. In contrast, in FAZF-expressing clones 3 days post-induction, 90% of cells accumulated in G1, and cells in S and G2/M phase decreased (Fig7). We conclude that enforced FAZF expression in these cells causes accumulation in the G1phase of the cell cycle. As shown in Fig 4, both PLZF and FAZF are highly expressed in CD34+ cells and in proliferating derivatives up to 7 days of culture in vitro, and then much lower levels of FAZF and PLZF proteins are detected thereafter. At this time cells in the population are predominantly in S phase and G1 (70%, 29%, respectively) (19Dai M.S. Mantel C.R. Xia Z.B. Broxmeyer H.E. Lu L. Blood. 2000; 96: 3985-3987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, physiologic expression of FAZF or PLZF is compatible with proliferation and differentiation in this context, at least up to about day 7. We infer from these data that appropriate expression of FAZF is required in the early stages of hematopoietic differentiation, and FAZF-dependent accumulation of cells in G1 is conditional, depending on cell type and differentiation status. FAZF was identified as an interacting partner of the Fanconi anemia protein FANCC by a yeast two-hybrid assay, subcellular colocalization, and coimmunoprecipitation (4Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FAZF also interacts with another FA protein, FANCG, in yeast two-hybrid and in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, reinforcing the notion that FAZF might be part of the FA protein complex (26Matkovic M.E.

We characterize a promoter that normally exhibits highly tissue- and stage-specific expression but displays ubiquitous expression when cells become immortalized or malignant, regardless of their lineage or tissue origin. This promoter normally drives the expression of thePem homeobox gene in specific cell types in ovary and placenta but is aberrantly expressed in lymphomas, neuroblastomas, retinoblastomas, carcinomas, and sarcomas. By deletion analysis we identified a region between nucleotides −80 and −104 that was absolutely critical for the expression from this distal Pempromoter (Pem Pd). Site-specific mutagenesis and transfection studies revealed that this region contains two consensus Ets sites and a single Sp1 site that were necessary for Pem Pd expression. Gel shift analysis showed that Ets and Sp1 family members bound to these sites. Transfection studies demonstrated that the Ets family members Elf1 and Gabp and the Sp1 family members Sp1 and Sp3 transactivated the Pem Pd. Surprisingly, we found that Sp3 was a more potent activator of the Pem Pdthan was Sp1; this is unusual, because Sp3 is either a weak activator or a repressor of most other promoters. Activation by either Elf1 or Gabp required an intact Sp1 family member binding site, suggesting that Ets and Sp1 family members cooperate to activate Pem Pdtranscription. Expression from the Pem Pd (either transiently transfected or endogenous) depended on the Ras pathway, which could explain both its Ets- and Sp1-dependent expression in normal cells and its aberrant expression in tumor cells, in which ras protooncogenes are frequently mutated. We suggest that the Pem Pd may be a useful model system to understand the molecular mechanism by which a tissue-specific promoter can be corrupted in tumor cells.

Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One important class of genes that regulates both developmental and tumorigenic events is the homeobox gene family (2Caldas C. Aparicio S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1999; 18: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 3Castronovo V. Kusaka M. Chariot A. Gielen J. Sobel M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This gene family encodes a large group of transcription factors that each contain a 60-amino acid DNA-binding motif termed a homeodomain. Although much is known about the function of homeodomain transcription factors, little is known about the regulation of the genes that encode them, particularly in response to signals in tumor cells. One homeobox gene of interest in this regard is Pem, which we originally cloned by subtraction hybridization from a T cell lymphoma clone (4Sasaki A.W. Doskow J. MacLeod C.L. Rogers M.B. Gudas L.J. Wilkinson M. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,5Wilkinson M.F. Kleeman J. Richards J. MacLeod C.L. Dev.

Pem is the founding member of the recently definedPEPP homeobox subfamily, a small group of homeobox genes on the X chromosome that are all normally expressed in reproductive tissues (6Maiti S.

Pem is expressed in parietal and visceral endodermal cells, where it appears to regulate the development of cells that eventually form portions of the placenta (5Wilkinson M.F. Kleeman J. Richards J.

In the ovary, Pem expression is restricted to granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles. In the testis, Pem is specifically expressed in Sertoli cells at stages VI–VIII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle. In striking contrast to its tissue- and stage-specific expression in normal tissues, Pem is aberrantly expressed in a wide range of tumor cell types regardless of their origin (5Wilkinson M.F. Kleeman J. Richards J. MacLeod C.L. Dev. Biol. 1990; 141: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the ubiquitous expression of Pem in tumors reflects a causal role for Pem in promoting tumor cell growth and metastasis or whether instead Pem expression is a consequence of immortalization and malignant conversion. In support of the former, it was shown recently that Pem physically interacts with the tumor suppressor protein menin (13Lemmens I.H. Forsberg L. Pannett A.A. Meyen E. Piehl F. Turner J.J.

Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17536-17546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that Pem transcripts are derived from two promoters that are independently regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The proximal promoter (Pem Pp) is expressed exclusively in male reproductive tissues, whereas the distal promoter (Pem Pd) is preferentially transcribed in the female reproductive tissues ovary and placenta (7Rao M. Wilkinson M.F. Robaire B. Hinton B.T. The Epididymis: From Molecules to Clinical Practice. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2002: 269-283Google Scholar, 15Maiti S. Doskow J., Li, S. Nhim R.P.

In the present investigation, we determined which promoter is responsible for the ubiquitous expression of Pem in tumor cells. We found that the Pem Pd was responsible for this aberrant expression. We then defined the cis elements upstream of the Pem Pd transcription start site that were necessary and sufficient for expression in both tumor cells and normal granulosa cells. We identified specific Ets and Sp1 transcription factor family members that bound to these cis elements and controlled the expression of Pem in a ras-dependent manner. Our data suggest that the Pem Pd is normally a tissue-specific promoter that is aberrantly expressed in diverse tumor cell types because it is activated by ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that are regulated in normal cells but constitutively activated in tumor cells. The SL12.1, SL12.3, SL12.4, N4TG1, M12, Ras/RAT-1, PS-1, S194/5, and 10T1/2 cell lines were maintained in tissue culture plates containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg of both penicillin and streptomycin per ml. Drosophila melanogaster SL2 Schneider cells were kindly provided by Dr. Mitzi Kuroda (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) and were maintained in tissue culture flasks containing Schneider's D. melanogaster medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 mg of both penicillin and streptomycin per ml. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Antibodies for Sp1 (Sp1 SC-420), Sp3 (Sp3 D-20), and Elf1 (C-20) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies, directed against recombinant GABPα and GABPβ1 (16Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), were gifts from Dr. Thomas Brown (Pfizer, Groton, CT). Immature female rats (55–60 g, 23 days old) were injected with 1.5 mg of 17-β-estradiol per day and then kept for 3 days before granulosa cells were harvested. The rats were treated in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Committee on Animal Care of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Ovarian granulosa cells were isolated as described previously (17Morris J.K. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16633-16643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ovaries were punctured multiple times with a 22-gauge needle to isolate granulosa cells. The granulosa cells were pooled and treated with 20 μg of trypsin per ml for 1 min, and then 300 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor per ml and 160 μg of DNase I per ml were added to remove necrotic cells. The cells were washed twice and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 medium at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2 for 16 h. A 1.3-kb SpeI-SalI rat genomic Pem fragment containing exon 1 and upstream sequences (15Maiti S. Doskow J., Li, S. Nhim R.P. Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol.

This construct was then used as a PCR template to generate deletion constructs −112 (Pem-147), −104 (Pem-170), −94 (Pem-167), and −73 (Pem-148), which were each made by using a T3 polymerase antisense oligonucleotide (oligo) in combination with the sense oligos MDA-298, MDA-396, MDA-392, and MDA-319, respectively (Table I). All of these sense primers contained an NdeI site except for the primer used to generate Pem-148, which contained anXhoI site instead. Substitution mutations were generated with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then confirmed by DNA sequencing. The site-specific mutagenized constructs −112/S1 (Pem-171), −112/E1 (Pem-172), and −112/E2 (Pem-175) were made by using the sense oligos MDA-397, MDA-399, and MDA-419, in combination with the antisense oligos MDA-398, MDA-400, and MDA-420, respectively. To generate the −81 to −104/Δc-fos construct (Pem-179), a single copy of sequences nt1 −104 to −81 was cloned into the SalI-HindIII site of the plasmid Δ56FosdE-luciferase (kindly provided by Craig A. Hauser, Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA), which contains a minimal c-fos promoter.

Before transfection, all mammalian cell lines were replated in 6-well plates at a density of ∼106cells per well in 0.8 ml of serum-free medium. Plasmid DNA was suspended in 100 μl of serum-free medium, mixed with 100 μl of serum-free medium premixed with 15 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and then incubated for 40 min at room temperature. The DNA-lipid complex was then added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 12–14 h. The cells were then replenished with fresh medium containing serum and incubated for 48 h. Stably transfected SL12.4 and 10T1/2 stable cell lines were generated by providing 2 mg/ml G418 every other day until only antibiotic-resistant cells remained alive (2–3 weeks). D. melanogaster Schneider cells and primary ovarian granulosa cells were transfected by using the calcium phosphate method (18Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid DNA diluted in 2× HBS buffer (280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4, and 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2)) was precipitated by dropwise addition of 250 mmCaCl2. After incubation for 30 min, 300 μl of the DNA precipitate was added dropwise to each well, and then the cells were incubated for 6–8 h at 26 °C (for the Schneider cells) or at 37 °C (for the granulosa cells). The incubation medium was then carefully aspirated and replaced with fresh media, and then the Schneider and granulosa cells were incubated for 48 and 6 h, respectively. Cell lysates for luciferase assay were prepared by centrifuging the cells at 1000 rpm (750 relative centrifugal force) for 2 min, and then 1× lysis buffer (Promega) was added to the cell pellet. Luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all transient transfection experiments, Renilla luciferase activity from the Pem Pd was normalized relative to firefly luciferase activity expressed from a thymidine kinase promoter-driven construct (pGL2TK). Expression from plasmids containing Pemsequences was compared with the empty control vectors pRL-Null, pPac, or Δc-fos. Total cellular RNA was isolated as described previously by guanidinium isothiocyanate lysis and centrifugation over a 5.7 m CsCl cushion (4Sasaki A.W. Doskow J. MacLeod C.L. Rogers M.B. Gudas L.J. Wilkinson M. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Pem cDNA probe used for Northern blot analysis was prepared as described previously (5Wilkinson M.F. Kleeman J. Richards J. MacLeod C.L. Dev. Biol. 1990; 141: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A cyclophilin cDNA probe (19Danielson P.E. Forss-Petter S. Brow M.A. Calavetta L. Douglass J. Milner R.J. Sutcliffe J.G. DNA (New York). 1988; 7: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) was used as a loading control. RNA was analyzed by RPA, performed as described previously (11Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 471-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The [32P]UTP-labeled mouse Pem RPA probe was prepared by in vitro transcription, as described previously (Pem probe E) (15Maiti S. Doskow J., Li, S. Nhim R.P. Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17536-17546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The β-actin RPA probe was prepared in the same manner; it contained nt 135–169 of human β-actin exon 3 (GenBankTM accession number X00351). A set of RNA size markers generated from the century ladder template (Ambion, Inc.) was included in all gels. Crude nuclear extracts used for EMSAs were prepared as follows. SL12.4 cells (∼107) were collected by centrifuging the cells at 700 rpm (∼400 relative centrifugal force) for 3 min. The cells were then washed with ice-cold Tris-saline, resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm (3100 relative centrifugal force) for 30 s and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer B (buffer A plus 0.15% Nonidet P-40) on ice for 15 min. Nuclear proteins were extracted in 100 μl of hypertonic buffer C (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C on a rocking platform. EMSAs were performed by using a 32P-labeled blunt-end double-stranded probe generated by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides (oligos) (MDA-473 and MDA-474). The probe (5 × 104 cpm) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC)) containing 1 μg of nuclear extract. For antibody supershift and blocking assays the reaction mixture was preincubated with monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antisera (2 μg) at room temperature for 20 min before addition of the 5′ 32P-labeled blunt-ended double-stranded oligonucleotide. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4.5–5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels at 150 V for 3–4 h at 4 °C. We showed previously (5Wilkinson M.F. Kleeman J. Richards J. MacLeod C.L. Dev. Biol. 1990; 141: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that despite its cell type-specific expression in normal cells, Pem is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tumors cell lines regardless of their lineage. Here we determined whether Pem is expressed in tumor cells from its distal promoter (Pem Pd) or its proximal promoter (Pem Pp). We investigated this issue in six tumor cell lines derived from different tissues and cell lineages, all of which expressed Pem mRNA, as assessed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 A). To determine promoter usage, RPA was performed with a probe that distinguishes between Pem Pd- and Pem Pp-derived transcripts (15Maiti S. Doskow J., Li, S. Nhim R.P. Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17536-17546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, all cell lines protected a band of ∼80 nt that corresponded to the Pem Pdtranscript. In contrast, none of the cell lines expressed the Pem Pp transcript, which is normally expressed in testes (Fig.1 B). We next determined the sequences important forPem Pd transcription. Promoter activity was assessed by measuring luciferase levels in transiently transfected SL12.4 T lymphoma cells. We first tested a construct containing 304 nt of sequence upstream of the exon 1-intron 1 junction. As shown in Fig.2 A, this −304 construct expressed high levels of luciferase activity (90–110-fold more than empty vector), indicating that it contained sequences sufficient for high level Pem Pd transcription. Deletion analysis was then performed to define functionally importantcis elements in this 304-nt region. All deletion constructs tested had a common 3′ end that included the transcription start sites defined previously between 22 and 40 nt upstream of the exon 1-intron 1 junction (15Maiti S. Doskow J., Li, S. Nhim R.P. Lindsey J.S. Wilkinson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17536-17546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Deletion of sequences from nt −304 to −104 did not appreciably reduce promoter activity (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the −94 construct had much lower activity (about 10-fold less) than the −104 construct, indicating that sequences between nt −104 and −94 were critical for maximal Pem Pd transcription. Even less luciferase activity was detected from the −73 construct (60-fold less than the −104 construct). We therefore conclude that the region between nt −73 and −104 is indispensable for promoter activity. Inspection of this 32-nt region revealed two putative Ets protein-binding sites (E1 and E2 in Fig.2 B) and one Sp1 protein-binding site (S1 in Fig.2 B). To determine whether these putative binding sites were necessary for Pem gene transcription, we mutated them and tested for transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 2 B, mutation of either the E1 or S1 site in the −112 Pemconstruct strongly decreased promoter activity. Mutation of both sites led to a further decrease in promoter activity, suggesting the importance of both the Sp1 and the E1 Ets site for transcription. Mutation of the other Ets site (E2) led to a less drastic but still significant decrease in promoter activity (Fig. 2 B). Next we determined whether the region containing the Ets- and Sp1-binding sites is sufficient to drive transcription. As shown in Fig. 2 C, a single copy of a sequence containing these three sites (nt −81 to −104) was sufficient to drive transcription from a heterologous minimal c-fos promoter (4–6-fold over basal level). This confirmed the functional importance of these Ets and Sp1 family binding sites, and thus we elected to call this region thePem Pd promoter element. To determine the specificity of this Pem Pd promoter element, we transfected the minimal −112 Pem construct containing this element into the immature T cell lymphoma cell clones SL12.1 and SL12.3, both of which express little or no Pemtranscripts from the endogenous Pem gene (Fig.3 A). We found that the SL12.1 cell clone expressed luciferase activity that was indistinguishable from background levels, and the SL12.3 cell clone expressed trace levels of luciferase activity that was much lower than that from the SL12.4 cell clone (Fig. 3 B). Having shown that the Sp1 and Ets family binding sites upstream of the Pem Pd transcription start site are necessary for Pem Pd transcription, it was imperative to identify the proteins interacting with these sites. Incubation of a double-stranded 26-mer oligo probe containing this region with SL12.4 nuclear extracts and analysis by EMSA revealed at least four specific protein-DNA complexes (Fig.4 A, complexes 1–4). An unlabeled oligo with a mutation in the Sp1-binding site (oligo M1) competed for bands 3 and 4 but not bands 1 and 2, and thus bands 1 and 2 represented proteins binding to the Sp1 site. Likewise, an oligo with mutations in the Ets-binding site (M2) competed with bands 1 and 2 only, indicating that complexes 3 and 4 contained proteins binding to the Ets site. An oligo with both the Sp1 and Ets (E1) sites (M3) had no effect on complex formation, demonstrating that these two sites are responsible for the four complexes. To identify specific proteins that bind to the Pem Pdelement, we used antibodies against Sp1 and Ets family members. Monoclonal antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3 supershifted complexes 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 4 B), consistent with our mutant-oligo competition experiments that demonstrated that complexes 1 and 2 contain proteins binding to the Sp1 family site in the Pem Pd element (Fig. 4 A). To identify the transcription factors that bound to the Ets-binding site, we used a battery of antibodies against different Ets family members. We found that polyclonal antibodies against Elf1 and Gabp (α and β) inhibited the generation of complexes 3 and 4, respectively (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, addition of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies directed against various other Ets family members, including Ets1, Ets2, Erg1, and Elk1, failed to modify the nucleoprotein complexes formed with thePem Pd probe (data not shown). We conclude that the Ets family members Elf1 and Gabp and the Sp1 family members Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the Pem Pd promoter element. To determine the functional importance of Sp1 and Ets family members inPem transcription, we performed a series of transient transfection experiments with the D. melanogasterSchneider SL12 cell line, which lacks Sp1 family members (20Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 21Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, transfection of increasing amounts of Sp1 expression plasmid (25–100 ng) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase (5–20-fold) in promoter activity. Similarly, Sp3 also transactivated the Pem Pd in a dose-dependent manner. In fact, Sp3 was a more potent activator (20–800-fold) than Sp1. Sp1 and Sp3 together exerted an additive effect in transactivating the Pem Pd (Fig.5 A). Elf1 and Gabp also stimulated luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). Transfection of Elf1 and Gabp simultaneously resulted in an additive increase in promoter activity (Fig 5 B). Transfection of all four transcription factor plasmids (Elf1, Gabp,Sp1, and Sp3) also resulted in additive stimulation of promoter activity. To determine whether the three DNA-binding sites for these different transcription factors was necessary for transactivation, we performed cotransfection experiments with mutant Pem Pd constructs. In these experiments, we used the Sp3 expression plasmid rather than the Sp1 expression plasmid, as Sp3 had more potent transactivation activity than Sp1. Results from cotransfection of Sp3 expression plasmid with a Pem Pd construct containing a mutation at the Sp1 site (−112/S1) demonstrated that transactivation by Sp3 required its cognate binding site (Fig.6). Surprisingly, Sp3 transactivation also required the Ets-binding sites, as mutation of either the E1 or E2 sites prevented the induction of Pem Pd transcription in response to Sp3 (Fig. 6). Thus it appeared that one or more Schneider cell factors must bind to the Ets-binding sites for Sp3-mediated transactivation to occur. Similarly, Elf1 and Gabp transactivation required not only the Ets-binding sites but also the adjacent Sp1 site (Fig. 6). This implies that Schneider cells express an endogenous Sp1 site-binding factor (although not an Sp1 family member) that participates with mammalian Ets factors to drive Pem Pdtranscription. These results suggest that Ets and Sp1 family members functionally cooperate to activate Pem Pd transcription (see “Discussion”). To assess the functional importance of these transcription factors forPem transcription in mammalian cells, we transiently transfected plasmids encoding DN mutants into the SL12.4 T cell clone. As shown in Fig. 7 A, transfection of DN-Gabp (α and β) expression plasmids caused a dose-dependent repression of Pem Pdpromoter activity (Fig. 7 A). A DN-Sp3 expression plasmid also strongly inhibited Pem Pd transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B). Because the encoded DN-Sp3 protein lacks a transcription activation domain but has a DNA-binding domain, it probably inhibits the activity of all Sp1 family members, as they all have the same DNA bi"
https://openalex.org/W2063812215,"α1-Adrenergic signaling in cardiac myocytes activates the skeletal muscle α-actin gene through an MCAT cis-element, the binding site of the transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) family of transcription factors. TEF-1 accounts for more than 85% of the MCAT binding activity in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Other TEF-1 family members account for the rest. Although TEF-1 itself has little effect on the α1-adrenergic activation of skeletal muscle α-actin, the related factor RTEF-1 augments the response and is a target of α1-adrenergic signaling. Here, we examined another TEF-1 family member expressed in cardiac muscle, DTEF-1, and observed that it also augmented the α1-adrenergic response of skeletal muscle α-actin. A DTEF-1 peptide-specific antibody revealed that endogenous DTEF-1 accounts for up to 5% of the MCAT binding activity in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. A TEF-1/DTEF-1 chimera suggests that α1-adrenergic signaling modulates DTEF-1 function. Orthophosphate labeling and immunoprecipitation of an epitope-tagged DTEF-1 showed that DTEF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo. α1-Adrenergic stimulation increased while phosphatase treatment lowered the MCAT binding by DTEF-1 and the endogenous non-TEF-1 MCAT-binding factor. In contrast, α1-adrenergic stimulation did not alter, and phosphatase treatment increased, MCAT binding of TEF-1 and RTEF-1. Taken together, these results suggest that DTEF-1 is a target for α1-adrenergic activation of the skeletal muscle α-actin gene in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. α1-Adrenergic signaling in cardiac myocytes activates the skeletal muscle α-actin gene through an MCAT cis-element, the binding site of the transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) family of transcription factors.

MCAT elements are found in the promoters of many genes expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells (5Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K.G. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3742-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and are bound by members of the transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1)1family, originally isolated as a transcription factor required for SV40 enhancer function in HeLa cells (6Davidson I.

Cell. 1988; 54: 931-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, a role for TEF-1 in mediating the α1-adrenergic response of MCAT-dependent promoters to hypertrophic signals has been proposed (4Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2293-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), but does not prevent the expression of MCAT-dependent cardiac genes, suggesting that other MCAT-binding factors exist. We cloned a cDNA encoding a TEF-1-related protein, RTEF-1, from an adult human heart cDNA library (12Stewart A.F.R. Richard 3rd, C.W. Suzow J. Stephan D. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Adra C.N. Genomics. 1996; 37: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), demonstrating the existence of at least two functional MCAT-binding factors in human cardiac myocytes. The effect of TEF-1 and RTEF-1 overexpression on the α1-adrenergic activation of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter was tested in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Whereas TEF-1 had no effect, RTEF-1 potentiated the α1-adrenergic induction of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter, suggesting that RTEF-1 can mediate α1-adrenergic signaling in adult cardiac myocytes (13Stewart A.F.R. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis identified potential targets of α1-adrenergic signaling in RTEF-1 (14Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, it remains uncertain whether RTEF-1 is the only target of the MCAT-dependent α1-adrenergic response in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. A third TEF-1 family member named ETF, for embryonic TEA domain-containing factor (15Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ohkubo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is expressed in the cerebellum and testis in the mouse embryo. A fourth TEF-1 factor called DTEF-1 is highly expressed in the chicken heart (16Azakie A. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K.G. Grenningloh G. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8260-8265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although not cardiac-enriched in the mouse, DTEF-1 (also called ETFR-1 or TEF-5) is also expressed in the adult mouse (17Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Ohkubo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and human heart (18Jacquemin P. Martial J.A. Davidson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12928-12937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas DTEF-1 is detected in the mid- to late-gestational fetal mouse heart (19Brunskill E.W. Witte D.P. Yutzey K.E. Potter S.S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 507-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Jacquemin P. Sapin V. Alsat E. Evain-Brion D. Dolle P. Davidson I. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), RTEF-1 is not detected at this time. Thus, DTEF-1 is a better candidate to mediate the α1-adrenergic response of MCAT-dependent promoters in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Here, we show that DTEF-1 is detected in nuclear extracts of cultured cardiac myocytes, that DTEF-1 overexpression augments the α1-adrenergic response of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter, and that DTEF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo. Moreover, the MCAT binding activity of DTEF-1 is increased in response to α1-adrenergic stimulation and reduced by phosphatase treatment, just like the endogenous non-TEF-1 MCAT binding activity. Therefore, in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, DTEF-1 contributes to the MCAT-dependent α1-adrenergic activation of the skeletal muscle α-actin gene. The CMV enhancer-driven TEF-1 expression plasmid pXJ40-TEF-1A and the parental plasmid pXJ40 (21Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) are a gift from Prof. Pierre Chambon. The RTEF-1 expression plasmid pXJ40-RTEF-1 was described previously (13Stewart A.F.R. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mouse DTEF-1 cDNA was a gift from Prof. Hiroaki Ohkubo. A DTEF-1 expression plasmid was constructed by releasing theEcoRI/KpnI insert containing the cDNA encoding mouse DTEF-1 (17Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Ohkubo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) from pBluescript and cloning this fragment into the CMV enhancer-driven pXJ40 expression vector. The chimeric TDT construct was obtained by introducing novel restriction enzyme sites in the cDNA sequence of TEF-1 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An MscI site was introduced into the DNA-binding domain using the oligonucleotide pair: 5′-GCTTTCAGGAGGCCCTGGCCATCTATCCACCATGTGG-3′ and 5′-CAGGAAATTTGTCATAGATCTGACGAATGTCC-3′. A BglII site was introduced into the TEF-1 sequence encoding the activation domain using the oligonucleotide pair: 5′-GGACATTCGTCAGATCTATGACAAATTTCCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGGAAATTTGTCATAGATCTGACGAATGTCC-3′. TheMscI/BglII fragment of DTEF-1 encoding the 5 putative serine phosphorylation targets was introduced in lieu of the same fragment excised from the mutagenized TEF-1 sequence. The DTEF-1 and TEF-1 cDNAs were subcloned into pBluescript and transformed into DM1 (dam−) bacteria (Invitrogen) to permitMscI digestion. The chimeric TDT cDNA was subcloned into the pXJ40 expression vector transformed into DH5α bacteria (Invitrogen), as were all other expression and reporter plasmids. The DTEF-1 hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag fusion protein (DTEF-HA) was obtained by introducing the hemagglutinin coding sequence at the carboxyl-terminal end of pXJ40 DTEF. A 672-bp fragment of pXJ40 DTEF that included the HA epitope tag was generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The amplified product was digested withBglII and subcloned into the phosphatase-treated pXJ40 DTEF vector. The following oligonucleotides were used to make pXJ40 DTEF-HA: 5′-GATAGATCTCTATGCGTAGTCTGGTACGTCGTATGGATAGTCTTTGACAAGCTTGTAGACGTGG-3′ and 5′-ctacgcctcctggagtattctgc-3′. All oligonucleotides were synthesized and HPLC-purified by Operon Technologies, Inc (Alameda, CA). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The mouse −113 skeletal α-actin/CAT reporter construct was a gift from Prof. Paul Simpson (10Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Antibody was raised in rabbits against amino acids 141–154 of mouse DTEF-1 by Zymed Laboratories (South San Francisco, CA) using standard procedures. Nuclear extracts prepared from H1299 cells (human lung carcinoma cell line) transfected by FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with CMV expression vectors encoding mouse DTEF-1, rat TEF-1, and mouse RTEF-1 (a gift from Prof. Irwin Davidson) were used for Western blot analysis. Nuclear extracts were prepared 48-h post-transfection using N-PER nuclear extraction kit (Pierce). An antibody (22Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8266-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that recognizes all TEF-1 family members (pan-TEF-1) was used to detect overexpressed proteins in transfected H1299 cells. For the gel mobility supershift experiments, TEF-1, DTEF-1, and RTEF-1 proteins were produced byin vitro transcription/translation (Quick-coupled, Promega) of the corresponding plasmid vectors. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were isolated and cultured and were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (14Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A total of 20 μg of DNA was added per plate; 5 μg of reporter plasmid (−113 SKA), 100 ng of CMV-driven expression plasmid (pXJ40, pXJ40-TEF-1A, pXJ40-DTEF-1, and pXJ40-TDT) and adjusted to 20 μg with pBluescript plasmid. Our previous studies showed that 100 ng of expression vector produced the optimal response (13Stewart A.F.R. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The day after transfection, medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing either 100 μm vitamin C vehicle or 100 μm of the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine. Cells were maintained 2 additional days in serum-free medium and then harvested for the CAT assay. CAT activity was assessed as described previously (14Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fold activities (± S.D.) are expressed relative to the empty expression vector set at 1-fold and represent the percent conversion from unacetylated to acetylated chloramphenicol for each promoter reporter plasmid. By independent samples Student's t test, mean-fold activities were considered different from 1-fold at the 95% confidence interval. Nuclear protein extract from cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were prepared essentially as described by Farrance et al. (23Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For nuclear extracts from transfected cells, 5 × 106 cardiac myocytes were plated on 100-mm culture dishes and transfected as described above except that 13 μg of the expression plasmids were used. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Nuclear protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma) against a bovine serum albumin standard curve. The gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously, using the MCAT element of the mouse skeletal α-actin promoter (14Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To test for the effects of protein phosphorylation, nuclear extracts were treated with the serine/threonine selective lambda protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs, 80 units) for 30 min at 30 °C prior to incubation with radiolabeled oligonucleotide. The lambda protein phosphatase does not dephosphorylate the radiolabeled oligonucleotide (data not shown). For Western blot analysis of the DTEF-HA protein, nuclear extracts were prepared from CMV- or DTEF-HA-transfected cardiac myocytes treated for 24 h with either the vitamin C vehicle or the α1-agonist phenylephrine. Samples were electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%), transferred to polyvinylpyrolydone fluoride membrane and probed with an anti-HA antibody and developed by chemiluminescence using the Supersignal® substrate (Pierce). For orthophosphate labeling, the day after transfection, medium was changed to a phosphate-free Earle's salts buffered medium supplemented with transferrin, insulin, and bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed twice in this medium and were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator for 10 min each time. Cells were then treated with vehicle or with phenylephrine in medium supplemented with 800 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate per plate and harvested for immunoprecipitation 3 h later. After orthophosphate labeling, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) were added in all buffers. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above and were immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody (Sigma) in low stringency buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml aprotinin and 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 16 h at 4 °C. Extracts were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed four times in the same low stringency buffer, resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-lysis buffer, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%). The gel was dried down and quantitated using a phosphorimager. To determine whether DTEF-1 might differ functionally from TEF-1 in terms of its regulation by α1-adrenergic signaling, putative phosphorylation consensus targets were compared between TEF-1 and DTEF-1 (Fig.1). Not counting sites that are shared between TEF-1 and DTEF-1 (and therefore are unlikely to contribute to functional differences), 6 sites in TEF-1 and 9 sites in DTEF-1 were identified. Protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are thought to mediate α1-adrenergic phosphorylation in cardiac myocytes. More recently, inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and dephosphorylation of GSK3-targeted serine residues have been implicated in contributing to the α1-adrenergic response of cardiac myocytes (24Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D. Alessandrini A. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Michael A. Force T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Three of the four GSK3 sites in DTEF-1 cluster in the serine/threonine/tyrosine-rich (STY) domain of DTEF-1 (Fig. 1). Inhibition of GSK3 causes nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor GATA4 (25Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14466-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, no change in the nuclear localization of an epitope-tagged DTEF-1 was observed under any conditions (α1- or β-adrenergic stimulation or blockade, data not shown). Thus, mechanisms other than nuclear localization such as changes in cofactor interaction might operate if GSK3 inactivation plays a role in modulating DTEF-1 function. As for the MAPK and PKC sites, all but one appear to cluster in a narrow region just carboxyl-terminal to the DNA-binding domain of DTEF-1. The functional significance of this domain was tested in cardiac myocytes by constructing a chimeric expression vector between TEF-1 and DTEF-1 (Fig. 1 B). The effect of DTEF-1 overexpression was tested on a skeletal muscle α-actin promoter-driven CAT reporter construct in cardiac myocytes under basal conditions and after α1-adrenergic stimulation (Fig. 2, n ≥ 6). As reported previously (13Stewart A.F.R. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter was induced by the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine in the presence of the empty CMV expression vector (n = 12, p < 0.05). The α1-adrenergic selective antagonist prazosin (10 μm) but not the β-adrenergic antagonist timolol (10 μm) blocked the effect of phenylephrine (data not shown). The phenylephrine response of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter was augmented by RTEF-1 overexpression (n = 7), but not by TEF-1 (n = 8). TEF-1 overexpression squelched the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter under basal conditions and reduced the response to α1-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast to RTEF-1, DTEF-1 did not transactivate the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter under basal conditions (n = 8). However, like RTEF-1, DTEF-1 significantly augmented the α1-adrenergic response of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter (n = 8, p < 0.05). Thus, DTEF-1 also appears to be modulated by α1-adrenergic signaling in cardiac myocytes. A chimeric expression vector (TDT) in which the domain containing putative phosphorylated sequences of DTEF-1 was swapped into the TEF-1 sequence (see Fig. 1 A and “Experimental Procedures”) partially yet significantly restored the α1-adrenergic response of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter (Fig. 2 A,n = 6, p < 0.05). The chimeric protein TDT was detected to a similar level as overexpressed DTEF-1 and TEF-1 in nuclear extracts prepared from transfected cardiac myocytes as determined either in standard gel shift assays (Fig. 2, Band C) or in a gel supershift assay using a TEF-1-specific antibody (Fig. 2 D, compare MCBF in Dand TDT lanes). The TDT protein is not supershifted by the TEF-1-specific antibody because the epitope recognized by the antibody lies within the highly divergent swapped domain (see Fig.1 A). We have shown previously that 10–15% of the MCAT binding activity in cardiac myocytes is contributed by transcription factors other than TEF-1, presumably by other members of the TEF-1 family (14Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8266-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To confirm that DTEF-1 contributes to the non-TEF-1 MCAT binding activity in cardiac myocyte nuclear extracts, a peptide-specific antibody to DTEF-1 was obtained (Fig.3 A). Specificity of the antibody was tested by immunoblotting using nuclear extracts from H1299 cells overexpressing TEF-1, RTEF-1, and DTEF-1 (Fig. 3 B) and by gel mobility shift assays using in vitro translated TEF-1, RTEF-1, and DTEF-1 proteins (Fig. 3 C). The antibody was specific for DTEF-1 because it recognized DTEF-1 and not other TEF-1 family members in both Western and gel mobility shift analyses. The DTEF-1 antibody was used to determine if DTEF-1 is expressed in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. No DTEF-1 could be detected above background in Western blots of nuclear extracts from these cells (data not shown). However, DTEF-1 was detected in these cells in a gel mobility supershift assay and accounted for by up to 5% of the C2 MCAT-binding complex (Fig. 4). To confirm that DTEF-1 is phosphorylated in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and is a target of α1-adrenergic signaling-induced protein kinases, an epitope-tagged DTEF-1 construct was made. HA-tagged DTEF-1 protein was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of cardiac myocytes treated with a vitamin C vehicle or the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine. Western blot analysis shows that the 56 kDa protein is detected only in the DTEF-HA-transfected cardiac myocytes and not in the CMV-transfected myocytes (Fig. 5, Anti-HA). After 24 h of phenylephrine treatment, DTEF-HA protein levels were increased 1.3-fold relative to control. This likely reflects a low level of α1-adrenergic activation of the CMV enhancer of the expression vector. Transfected cardiac myocytes were labeled with orthophosphate for 3 h either under basal conditions or during α1-adrenergic stimulation. After immunoprecipitation of nuclear extract from the orthophosphate-labeled myocytes, DTEF-HA was radiolabeled even under basal conditions, indicating that it is phosphorylated in vivo. No signal was detected for the empty CMV expression vector. For transfected myocytes treated with phenylephrine, the level of DTEF-HA phosphorylation increased 5-fold relative to basal conditions, although background signal was also increased such that the signal to noise ratio was essentially unchanged. Thus, it is difficult to say whether α1-adrenergic stimulation further phosphorylates DTEF-1. Given that 5 of 9 putative phosphorylation targets of DTEF-1 are MAPK or PKC sites, these sites might be phosphorylated after α1-adrenergic stimulation. However, 4 of 9 sites are GSK3 sites that conversely might be dephosphorylated after α1-adrenergic stimulation. Evidence that any of these sites plays a role in mediating α1-adrenergic signaling through DTEF-1 would require an exhaustive site-directed mutagenesis whose results might be equivocal. Given that DTEF-1 is phosphorylatedin vivo and that changes in phosphorylation alter its DNA binding properties (see Fig. 6), α1-adrenergic signaling is likely to affect DTEF-1 function directly.Figure 6α1-Adrenergic stimulation increases MCAT binding by DTEF-1. In gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extract from transfected cardiac myocytes only shifted complexes are shown. A, myocytes transfected with empty expression vector (CMV, lanes 1–4) or DTEF-1 expression vector (lanes 5–12) were either treated with vitamin C vehicle (VC, 100 μm) or the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (PE, 100 μm) (n= 3 experiments). TEF-1 was supershifted with the anti-TEF-1 antibody to reveal the endogenous non-TEF-1 MCBF in lanes 2 and3 and the additional presence of DTEF-1 in lanes 6 and 7 and 10 and 11. A phosphoserine-specific antibody (PS) was used to detect the presence of phosphorylated proteins in the shifted complexes (lanes 3, 7, and 11). An HA epitope-specific antibody was used to supershift DTEF-1 (SS,lanes 8 and 12). Note that the HA-supershifted complex after PE treatment (lane 12) is more robust than in VC (lane 8) and that no HA-supershifted complex is seen in the CMV-transfected myocyte extract in lane 4. B,gel mobility shift assay using nuclear extract from TEF-1-transfected (lanes 1–6, n = 3) and RTEF-1-transfected (lanes 7–12, n = 2) cardiac myocytes. Note the additional presence of RTEF-1 in the non-TEF-1 MCBF band inlanes 8, 9, 11, and12. C, quantitation of the change in shifted complexes after phenylephrine stimulation (mean ± S.D.). The non-TEF-1 (non-T) component of the MCBF was quantitated after TEF-1 antibody supershift (lanes 2 and 5 inB, n = 3). The TEF-1 (T) supershifted complex (n = 8) did not show increased binding with PE stimulation (SS, lanes 6 and10 in A, lanes 2 and 5,8 and 11 in B) nor did the RTEF-1 (R) complex revealed by TEF-1 supershift of RTEF-1-transfected extracts (MCBF, lanes 8 and11 in B, n = 2). The HA epitope-specific antibody supershifted the DTEF-1 (D) component, and the supershifted band was significantly stronger after PE stimulation (n = 3, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of α1-adrenergic stimulation on MCAT binding by DTEF-1 was tested in a gel mobility shift assay using nuclear extract from DTEF-1-transfected cardiac myocytes (Fig. 6 A). A TEF-1-specific antibody revealed the DTEF-1 component of the MCAT-binding factor (MCBF) in the transfected myocytes (Fig. 6 A, lanes 6, 7,10, and 11). Stimulation of cardiac myocytes with the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine produced a 2- to 3-fold increase in the MCAT binding activity of overexpressed DTEF-1 (Fig. 6 A, MCBF in lane 10 versus lane 6). A phosphoserine-specific antibody reduced the DTEF-1-shifted complex in nuclear extract from vehicle-treated and in phenylephrine-treated cardiac myocytes (Fig. 6 A,lanes 7 and 11), further suggesting that DTEF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo. Moreover, when an antibody to the HA epitope tag of DTEF-1-HA was used to supershift the DTEF-1 component of the MCAT-binding factor, the supershifted complex from the phenylephrine-treated cells was twice as strong as from vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 6, A, SS, lane 12 versus lane 8 and C, n = 3,p < 0.05). Thus, α1-adrenergic stimulation increases DTEF-1 binding to the MCAT element. The endogenous non-TEF-1 MCAT-binding factor also showed an increased signal upon PE stimulation (Fig. 6 B, MCBF,lane 5 versus lane 2). In contrast, neither TEF-1 (Fig. 6, A, SS, lanes 6 and10 and B, SS, lanes 2 and5, 8 and 11) nor RTEF-1 (Fig.6 B, MCBF, lanes 8 and 11) appeared to bind more strongly after phenylephrine stimulation (Fig.6 C, n = 2 for RTEF-1 and n = 8 for TEF-1). To probe the consequences of protein phosphorylation on the function of MCAT-binding factors, nuclear extracts were treated with the serine/threonine-selective lambda protein phosphatase (Fig. 7,n ≥ three independent transfections). The MCAT binding activity of TEF-1 in a supershifted complex increased relative to control after phosphatase treatment (Fig. 7 A, compareTEF-1+Ab in lanes 3 versus 2, 5 versus 4, and 7 versus 6,n = 3, p < 0.05). Similarly, DNA binding activity of the RTEF-1 complex was also increased by phosphatase (Fig. 7 A, MCBF complex in lanes 7 versus 6, n = 4, p < 0.05). Like TEF-1, RTEF-1 differs from DTEF-1 at 3 amino-terminal GSK3 sites (data not shown). The amino terminus of RTEF-1 is phosphorylated under basal conditions in cardiac myocytes (14Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These GSK3 sites may affect DNA binding. In contrast, DTEF-1 binding was reduced by phosphatase treatment (Fig. 7 A, MCBF complex in lane 5 versus 4, n = 3, p < 0.05). This shows that, unlike TEF-1 and RTEF-1, phosphorylation of DTEF-1 can increase its DNA binding activity. This effect closely resembled the response of the endogenous residual MCAT-binding factor that remains after TEF-1 is supershifted with the antibody (Fig. 7 A, MCBF complex in lane 3 versus 2, n = 3, p < 0.05). Fig. 7 B shows the relative change in MCAT binding activity in each complex before and after phosphatase treatment. Thus, the non-TEF-1 (non-T) MCAT-binding factor present in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes appears to correspond more closely to DTEF-1. Taken together, these findings support a role for DTEF-1 in mediating the α1-adrenergic response of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Also, these data show that phosphorylation can differentially regulate the binding of TEF-1 family members. The TEF-1 family of transcription factors plays several important roles in the regulation of gene expression. TEF-1 factors are implicated in the earliest stage of zygotic gene expression (26Kaneko K.J. Cullinan E.B. Latham K.E. DePamphilis M.L. Development. 1997; 124: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are involved in early nervous system development (15Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ohkubo H. J. Biol.

Moreover, TEF-1 factors are implicated in the activation of a number of genes in cardiac myocytes in response to exogenous growth factors including transforming growth factor β (31MacLellan W.R.

Catecholamines bind to adrenergic receptors and activate signaling pathways that alter protein phosphorylation and change gene transcription. In a healthy heart, β-adrenergic receptor signaling is the main regulator of cardiac function that increases heart rate, the force of contraction, and the rate of relaxation. The cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) is known to mediate β-adrenergic receptor signaling. Expression of the α-myosin heavy chain gene is regulated by PKA (33Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Stewart A. Zak R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 1196-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and its basal and PKA-dependent expression require a hybrid MCAT/E-boxcis-element (30Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29677-29687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to which TEF-1 and the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein Max bind cooperatively (34Gupta M.P. Amin C.S. Gupta M. Hay N. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3924-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies (35Gupta M.P. Kogut P. Gupta M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3168-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown that TEF-1 is phosphorylated by PKA near the DNA binding domain, at Ser102 and that this phosphorylation may activate TEF-1 in cardiac myocytes. Interestingly, phosphorylation of TEF-1 by PKA was shown to inhibit MCAT binding, consistent with our observation of increased MCAT binding after phosphatase treatment. In a diseased heart, the reduced response to β-adrenergic receptor signaling makes α1-adrenergic signaling more prevalent. α1-Adrenergic receptors signal through PKC and the small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that activate MAPK (36Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When human choriocarcinoma cells were stimulated with the PKC activator 12-O-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), the activity of an MCAT-dependent promoter was reduced, whereas its activity was increased by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (37Jiang S.W. Dong M. Trujillo M.A. Miller L.J. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23464-23470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PKC, however, has an opposite effect on MCAT-mediated transcription in cardiac myocytes. The skeletal muscle α-actin, β myosin heavy chain, and b-type natriuretic peptide promoters are activated by PKC in an MCAT-dependent manner (4Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Kariya K. Farrance I.K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Even though TEF-1 phosphorylation by PKC in vitro inhibits DNA binding (37Jiang S.W. Dong M. Trujillo M.A. Miller L.J. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23464-23470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we have not observed reduced DNA binding of TEF-1 in cardiac myocytes stimulated with α1-adrenergic agonist (see Fig.6 B). Protein kinases other than PKC may be involved in directly phosphorylating TEF-1 in cardiac myocytes. We initially identified the TEF-1-related factor RTEF-1 as a potential candidate to mediate the α1-adrenergic response in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, because overexpression of human RTEF-1 augmented the α1-adrenergic activation of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter (13Stewart A.F.R. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RTEF-1 was further shown to be a target of α1-adrenergic signaling because site-directed mutagenesis of MAPK sites, especially of Ser322, significantly inhibited its ability to augment the α1-adrenergic activation of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter (14Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although RTEF-1 likely plays a role in modulating gene expression in the adult human myocardium, it is not known whether rat RTEF-1 plays a similar role in the α1-adrenergic response in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes because rat RTEF-1 has not been cloned and an antibody to rat RTEF-1 is not available. Several lines of evidence presented here suggest that DTEF-1 participates in the α1-adrenergic response. First, DTEF-1 is present and phosphorylated in neonatal rat cardiac myocyte nuclear extracts. Therefore, DTEF-1 is a potential target for intracellular signaling pathways activated by hypertrophic agents. Second, like RTEF-1, DTEF-1 augmented the α1-adrenergic activation of the skeletal muscle α-actin promoter. This augmentation maps to an area of DTEF-1 that contains phosphorylation sites that are divergent between DTEF-1 and TEF-1. Third, DNA binding of overexpressed DTEF-1 was increased by α1-adrenergic stimulation. This likely occurs through changes in phosphorylation because phosphorylation can modulate the DNA binding activity of DTEF-1. Therefore, it will be important to characterize the function of DTEF-1 in a transgenic model to further understand its modulation by various signaling pathways.

The protein consists of multiple copies of a 243-kDa polypeptide organized into discrete domains (Fig. 1 A) that have glutamine-dependent carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPSase),1 aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) and dihydroorotase (DHOase) activities. The CPSase activity, the first committed and rate-limiting step in the pathway, is the locus of control. Most CPSases share a common catalytic mechanism (4Meister A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 315-374PubMed Google Scholar) in which the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate proceeds through a complex series of partial reactions catalyzed by different functional domains.Glutamine+H2O→glutamate+NH3HCO3−+ATP→carboxyphosphate+ADPCarboxyphosphate+NH3→carbamate+PiCarbamate+ATP→carbamoyl phosphate+ADPREACTIONS1–4CPSases also have homologous domain structures. Glutamine hydrolysis (Reaction 1) occurs on the 40-kDa glutaminase domain or subunit. The synthetase (CPS) domain or subunit consists of two homologous 60-kDa subdomains, CPS.A and CPS.B. The activation of bicarbonate and the subsequent reaction with NH3 (Reactions 2 and 3) occurs on CPS.A, whereas the phosphorylation of carbamate to form carbamoyl phosphate (Reaction 4) occurs on CPS.B (5Post L.E.

There are two PKA phosphorylation sites, one located within the B3 regulatory subdomain (Ser1406) and a second (Ser1859) in the interdomain linker that connects the ATC and DHO domains (Fig. 1 A).

Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar) are ubiquitous components of the mitogen activated cascade that is involved in cellular proliferation in response to growth factors and have also been shown to be activated by oncogene products (23Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAPK phosphorylates Thr456 in the A1 subdomain of the CAD CPS (Fig.1 A). MAPK-mediated phosphorylation, like that of PKA, abolishes UTP inhibition; however, PRPP activation is markedly stimulated. Both the loss of sensitivity to UTP and increased sensitivity to PRPP would be expected to activate CPSase and thus is likely to be important for regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis. We have recently found (24Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that the growth-dependent activation and down-regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis is a consequence of the sequential action of MAPK and PKA. The CPSase activity of CAD is up-regulated by the MAPK cascade when cells enter the proliferative phase and is subsequently down-regulated in resting cells by PKA-mediated phosphorylation. During her seminal studies of PKA phosphorylation of CAD, Carrey noticed (17Carrey E.A. Campbell D.G. Hardie D.G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3735-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that radiolabeled phosphate was incorporated into CAD when it was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of exogenous kinases, a phenomenon that was attributed to either autophosphorylation or the presence of contaminating kinases. Among the estimated 1000 protein kinases in mammalian cells (25Hunter T. Cell. 1987; 50: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), intra- or intermolecular autophosphorylation has been found to be a common theme. Moreover, there are many examples, including cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and protein kinase C (26Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127: 51-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), where autophosphorylation is known to play an important role in the regulation of the kinase. While autophosphorylation is a common, perhaps universal characteristic of protein kinases (26Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127: 51-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it is less frequently observed in kinases that phosphorylate small molecules.

Acta. 1995; 1251: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but this observation was subsequently shown (30David S. Haley B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8492-8500Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) to be due to the incorporation of the entire nucleotide into the active site of the enzyme. Here we show that incubation of CAD with ATP resulted in incorporation of the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide into a specific threonine residue in CPS.B, that the reaction was catalyzed by CAD itself and was not the result of contaminating kinases, and that autophosphorylation resulted in increased CPSase activity and a modulation of the effects of the allosteric ligands, UTP and PRPP. CAD was isolated from BHK 165-23 (31Wahl G.M. Padgett R.A. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8679-8689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a baby hamster kidney cell line derived from BHK-21 in which the CAD gene was amplified by exposure to the ATCase inhibitor,N-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate. The protein was purified to homogeneity by 40% ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration chromatography on a Bio-Gel A-5m column (Bio-Rad) as described previously (3Coleman P. Suttle D. Stark G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6379-6385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some instances, CAD was further purified by affinity chromatography on anN-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate column (32Purcarea C. Herve G. Ladjimi M.M. Cunin R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4143-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CAD was also isolated from Escherichia coli transformed with pCKCAD10, a plasmid expressing the full-length CAD polypeptide as described previously (33Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23808-23816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli CPSase was purified from E. coli pLLK12 transformants following the protocol described by Guillou et al. (34Guillou F. Rubino S.D. Markovitz R.S. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8304-8308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Protein quantitation was performed by the Lowry method (35Lowry O. Rosenbrough N. Farr A. Randall R. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by scanning stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels calibrated with known amounts of bovine serum albumin using the software UNSCAN-IT (Silk Scientific Corp.). The phosphoserine (Z-PS1) and phosphothreonine (Z-PT1) rabbit polyclonal antibodies from Zymed Laboratories Inc. were used for immunoblotting at a dilution of 1:1000 to 1:2000. The rabbit polyclonal CAD serum prepared as previously described (36Grayson D.R. Lee L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15840-15849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used at a 1:5000 dilution. CAD at a concentration of 20–200 μg/ml in a kinase buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.48 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was reacted at 30 °C with ATP at the concentrations indicated. The extent of phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting or by measuring the incorporation of [γ-32P]inorganic phosphate. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 5 or 10% gels was carried out as described by Laemmli (37Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). The samples were heated at 100 °C for 4 min in loading buffer prior to electrophoresis. The proteins were separated and transferred onto a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer. The analysis was performed using the ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (24Sigoillot F.D. Evans D.R. Guy H.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15745-15751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Signals were visualized using Biomax ML film (Eastman Kodak Co.) and quantitated by scanning the immunoblots with a HP ScanJet 4c and the software UNSCAN-IT (Silk Scientific). Care was taken to ensure that all exposures fell within the linear response range of the film. The glutamine-dependent CPSase assay was carried out as previously described (33Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23808-23816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture (1 ml) contained 20–60 μg of protein, 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 7.5% Me2SO, 2.5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3.5 mmglutamine, 20.2 mm aspartate, 1.5 mm ATP, 3.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm sodium [14C]bicarbonate (1.6 × 106 μCi/mol). When UTP or PRPP were included, the concentration of MgCl2was adjusted in order to maintain a 2 mm excess over the sum of the concentrations of ATP, UTP, and PRPP. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 15 min and quenched by the addition of 1 ml of 40% trichloroacetic acid and heated at 100 °C for 15 min. Approximately 0.2 g of dry ice was added to the vials to eliminate the excess CO2 generated during the reaction. The sample was then heated at 100 °C for an additional 15 min prior to counting in a Beckman-Coulter counter. The ATCase and DHOase activities were determined using the previously described colorimetric method (38Prescott L.M. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 32: 408-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar,39Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The ATCase assay mixture contained 5 mm carbamoyl phosphate and 12 mm aspartate in a buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 7.5% Me2SO, 2.5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The DHOase activity was assayed by monitoring the conversion of 1 mm dihydroorotate to carbamoyl aspartate in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol. The on-membrane kinase assay was carried out according to Ferrell et al. (40Ferrell J.E., Jr. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20723-20729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified CAD (30–65 μg) was separated on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The protein was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking in a buffer containing 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA. The protein was renatured on the membrane for 16–18 h at 4 °C by incubation in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 0.1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma). The nitrocellulose membrane was then washed with a buffer containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, as a blocking agent, in 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated with 150 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) (4500 mCi/μmol) in 10 ml of kinase buffer consisting of 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, for 5 h. The reaction was quenched by washing the membrane twice in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The membrane was further washed once with a buffer containing 30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Igepal CA-630 and once in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 min each at room temperature. The membrane was then washed 10 min at room temperature in 1 m KOH and rinsed several times in 10% (v/v) acetic acid. The membrane was subjected to autoradiography using a Cyclone Storage phosphor screen, and the signals were captured with the Packard Cyclone Storage phosphor system. The membrane was also incubated after the blocking step above with 0.5 mm cold ATP in the kinase buffer and then subjected to Thr(P) immunoblotting and quantitation as described above. The phosphorylated residues were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. CAD (330 μg) was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After staining and destaining, the CAD bands were excised from the gel and pooled. The gel slices were washed twice with 50% acetonitrile in water and then frozen at −20 °C. The protein was digested in situ with trypsin, and sequence analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility by microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (μLC/MS/MS) on a Finnigan LCQ DECA quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The stoichiometry of CAD autophosphorylation was determined by the method described by Carrey et al. (17Carrey E.A. Campbell D.G. Hardie D.G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3735-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purified CAD (21.3 μg) was incubated in kinase buffer with 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (200 μCi/μmol) in a final volume of 100 μl for 120 min. Bovine serum albumin (20 μg) was added as a carrier, and the protein was precipitated by the addition of 50 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid. After 30 min on ice, the sample was centrifuged at 24,000 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min. The trichloroacetic acid precipitate was washed twice with 25% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 1 n NaOH. Scintillation mixture (RPI) was added (10 ml), and the sample was counted in a Beckman Coulter LS 6500 scintillation counter. While investigating the phosphorylation of purified CAD by PKA and MAPK, we noticed a persistent background phosphorylation. To further characterize this phenomenon, CAD was incubated with 0.5 mm ATP, and samples were withdrawn at the indicated times (Fig.2). Analysis by immunoblotting using antibodies directed against Thr(P) gave a strong signal and showed that the phosphorylation occurred slowly over a period of 2 h (Fig.2 A). No phosphorylation could be detected with phosphoserine (Ser(P)) antibodies (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–8), although control samples (lanes 9 and 10) using CAD phosphorylated with PKA indicated that the antibodies reacted strongly and specifically with the serine residues known to be phosphorylated by this kinase. The intensity of the signals was quantitated by scanning the immunoblots. The progress curve for Thr phosphorylation (Fig. 2 C) was distinctly sigmoidal and began to level off after about 1 h. A time course extended over a period of 7 h (not shown) indicated that no additional phosphorylation occurred after 2 h. Quantitation of the extent of phosphorylation resulting from six different phosphorylation experiments, determined by measuring the incorporation of either [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-33P]ATP into CAD during a 2-h reaction period (see “Experimental Procedures”), revealed that there was 0.97 ± 0.16 mol of phosphate incorporated/mol of CAD monomer. A series of reactions (Fig.3) were carried out to assess the requirements for phosphorylation. In contrast to the extensive threonine phosphorylation observed following incubation of CAD with 0.5 mm ATP (Fig. 3 A, lane 3), immunoblotting of unreacted CAD (lane 1) or of CAD incubated in the absence of ATP (lane 2) revealed only very low levels of threonine and serine phosphorylation. In the presence of the serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase 1, the extent of phosphorylation was markedly reduced (lane 4). No phosphorylation occurred when CAD was heat-denatured (lane 5) prior to incubation with ATP or if the reaction was carried out in the presence of EGTA to complex Mg2+ (lane 6). Phosphorylation proceeded apace even in the presence of the other CPSase substrates, bicarbonate and glutamine (lane 7). Threonine phosphorylation also occurred when PKA was present in the reaction mixture (lanes 8 and 9). Phosphoryl transfer did not occur using UTP, GTP, or PRPP as the phosphate-donating substrate (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–8). The lower levels of phosphorylation that occurred in the presence of both 0.5 mm ATP and either 0.5 or 4 mm ADP (Fig. 3 B, lanes 10and 11), suggested that the nucleotide diphosphate is a competitive inhibitor of the phosphorylation reaction. Interestingly, the presence of PKA (lane 9) in the reaction mixture appeared to reduce the extent of threonine phosphorylation during a 60-min reaction period (Fig. 3 B, lane 9; cf. lane 2) but had much smaller effect during the longer 2-h reaction times (Fig.3 A, lanes 8 and 9;cf. lane 3). This result suggests that the rate but not the extent of autophosphorylation may be influenced by the presence of protein kinase A. In summary, threonine but not serine residues are phosphorylated, the reaction is specific for MgATP, and the native CAD structure is required for phosphorylation to occur. It was possible that the phosphorylation of CAD was catalyzed by a contaminating kinase that copurified with the protein, although several preparations of CAD isolated from BHK165-23 cells exhibited the same extent of phosphorylation. To investigate this possibility, an “on-membrane” kinase assay, devised by Ferrell and Martin (40Ferrell J.E., Jr. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20723-20729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was carried out. CAD was subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The rationale for the method is that SDS gel electrophoresis should denature the proteins and separate CAD from any kinase that may be present and disrupt any putative CAD-kinase complexes. CAD was then renatured on the nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. Autoradiography clearly showed that CAD is phosphorylated and that the extent of phosphorylation increased linearly (Fig.4) with the amount of CAD applied to the SDS gel. Alternatively, the membrane was incubated with unlabeled ATP and then probed with Thr(P) and Ser(P) antibodies (not shown). This approach confirmed that phosphate was incorporated into threonine residues. CAD isolated from E. coli cells transformed with pCKCAD10 (33Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23808-23816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a plasmid expressing the full-length CAD polypeptide, was also found to be phosphorylated to the same extent as the CAD isolated from mammalian cells (data not shown). The relative paucity of Ser/Thr kinases in bacterial cells also argues against the involvement of contaminating kinases in the CAD phosphorylation. In contrast, purifiedE. coli CPSase exhibited no phosphorylation despite the conservation of the target threonine residue described below (Fig.1 B). Collectively, these experiments provide strong support for an intrinsic CAD kinase activity and suggest that phosphate incorporation is the result of an autophosphorylation reaction. To determine the site of autophosphorylation, CAD (0.3 mg) was reacted for 6 h with 0.5 mm ATP and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein bands were excised, exhaustively digested with trypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. The analysis clearly revealed two major phosphopeptides (Table I). Phosphopeptide 1 was located in the CPS.B B1 subdomain close to the junction with the B2 subdomain (Fig. 1 A). The sequence of this peptide revealed tandem threonine and serine residues. The analysis favored phosphoserine, although phosphorylation of the adjacent threonine residue could not be ruled out. Phosphopeptide 2 corresponded to the serine residue located in the interdomain linker connecting the DHO and ATC domains shown previously (17Carrey E.A. Campbell D.G. Hardie D.G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3735-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to be phosphorylated by PKA. There was an indication of a third phosphopeptide located within the glutaminase domain (phosphopeptide 3), although the evidence for this phosphopeptide was not compelling. For reasons discussed below, Thr1037 is considered to be the probable autophosphorylation site.Table IMass spectrometry analysis of autophosphorylated CADPeptideTarget residueDomainCAD residue nos.Sequence1Thr/SerCPS.B11034–1048VLGTSPEAIDSAENR2SerDA linker1855–1869IHRASDPGLPAEEPK31-aLow confidence assignment but possible phosphopeptide.SerGLN1-bGlutaminase domain.138–168LVQSGTEPSTLPFVDPNARPLAPEVSIKTPRAutophosphorylation sites are underlined.1-a Low confidence assignment but possible phosphopeptide.1-b Glutaminase domain. Open table in a new tab Autophosphorylation sites are underlined. The well characterized reaction of CAD with 5′-FSBA results in the selective modification of the ATP binding site of both the CPS.A and CPS.B domains (42Kim H.S. Lee L. Evans D.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10322-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To confirm the suspected involvement of the active sites of CPSase in autophosphorylation, CAD (1.3 μm) was reacted with 2.2 mm FSBA for 2 h as described previously (42Kim H.S. Lee L. Evans D.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10322-10329Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The excess reagent was removed by dialysis, and the extent of autophosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting using the Thr(P) antibodies. No autophosphorylation could be detected (data not shown). Since FSBA modification abolished the overall synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate and both ATP-dependent partial reactions, this result is consistent with the interpretation that ATP bound to the active site of either CPS.A or CPS.B or both is responsible for autophosphorylation. CAD was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with various ATP concentrations, and the extent of autophosphorylation was determined by scanning immunoblots probed with Thr(P) antibodies (Fig. 5). The resulting ATP saturation curve was hyperbolic, although significant substrate inhibition was apparent at ATP concentrations exceeding 2 mm. The ATP saturation curve of CPS.B exhibits similar inhibition at high ATP concentrations (41Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13762-13769"

To discover novel genes regulated by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), we performed differential display reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of NRP-152 rat prostatic epithelial cells and cloned a novel rat serpin that is transcriptionally down-regulated by TGF-β and hence named trespin (TGF-β-repressibleserine proteinase inhibitor (trespin). Trespin is a 397-amino acid member of the ov-serpin clade with a calculated molecular mass of 45.2 kDa and 72% amino acid sequence homology to human bomapin; however, trespin exhibits different tissue expression, cellular localization, and proteinase specificity compared with bomapin. Trespin mRNA is expressed in many tissues, including brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, prostate, skin, spleen, and stomach. FLAG-trespin expressed in HEK293 cells is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and is not constitutively secreted. The presence of an arginine at the P1 position of trespin's reactive site loop suggests that trespin inhibits trypsin-like proteinases. Accordingly, in vitro transcribed and translated trespin forms detergent-stable and thermostable complexes with plasmin and elastase but not subtilisin A, trypsin, chymotrypsin, thrombin, or papain. Trespin interacts with plasmin at a near 1:1 stoichiometry, and immunopurified mammal-expressed trespin inhibits plasmin in a dose-dependent manner.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). They are competitive inhibitors of serine or cysteine proteinases and can target more than one proteinase through the use of several P1 residues (13Riewald M. Schleef R.R. J. Biol.

Ov-serpins also share several properties: 1) the absence of an N-terminal signal sequence, 2) the beginning of their amino acid sequences relative to α1-antitrypsin at amino acid position ∼23, and 3) the lack of a carboxyl-terminal extension. Human ov-serpins are further characterized by gene structure, namely an exon encoding a polypeptide loop between α helices C and D (i.e. CD loop). The CD loop confers unique characteristics to serpins, such as nuclear localization, and provides a binding motif for ancillary proteins (15Ye R.D. Ahern S.M., Le Beau M.M. Lebo R.V. Sadler J.E. J.

The variety of physiological roles serpins regulate foreshadows their potential as novel therapeutic targets for many disease states. To identify genes whose products may serve as downstream mediators or regulators of transforming growth factor-β1 signal transduction (reviewed in Refs. 29Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 30Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we performed differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using NRP-152 rat prostatic cells treated with or without TGF-β1, either alone or in the presence of insulin, which blocks several of TGF-β1's effects. 2D. Danielpour, unpublished results.2D. Danielpour, unpublished results. NRP-152 is a unique androgen receptor-positive basal prostatic epithelial cell line highly sensitive to TGF-β1 (31Danielpour D.

From these differential display analyses, we have identified and characterized a widely expressed novel rat ov-serpin, trespin, which directly binds and inhibits plasmin with a stoichiometry of 1:1. The NRP-152 rat prostatic epithelial cell line (31Danielpour D. Kadomatsu K. Anzano M.A. Smith J.M. Sporn M.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3413-3421PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in GM2 culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml cholera toxin, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 0.1 μm dexamethasone) in Nunc 80-cm2 tissue culture flasks. The cells were kept at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 environment and at subconfluence (every 3–4 days) passaged 1:40. All experiments were performed under low serum conditions, where NRP-152 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 μmdexamethasone. HEK293, a human embryonic kidney cell line, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum. THP-1, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, was grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.05 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 500 μg/ml gentamycin. RBL-1, a rat basophilic leukemia cell line, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% calf serum and 400 μg/ml gentamycin. Following the method of Zhao et al. (35Zhao S. Ooi S.L. Pardee A.B. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 842-850PubMed Google Scholar), differential display RT-PCR was performed using total RNA prepared from either untreated NRP-152 cells (control) or cells treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in the absence or presence of insulin (5 μg/ml). The RNA for differential display was isolated by a modified RNeasy method (36Bonham M.J. Danielpour D. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The [33P]dATP-labeled PCR products were then resolved through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the selected bands were reamplified and cloned into pCR-TRAP (GenHunter). Total RNA was extracted from cells using an RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen) and resolved through a 1% agarose, 0.66 m formaldehyde gel. Equal loading of the gel was confirmed through ethidium bromide staining of 28 S ribosomal RNA. The RNA was then transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Nytran membranes were cross-linked using ultraviolet radiation and prehybridized, hybridized, and washed following the Church and Gilbert method (37Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). The presence of indicated mRNAs was detected with [32P]dCTP random primer-labeled cDNA probes. The RACE system (Invitrogen) was used to amplify TRG-13 cDNA from NRP-152 cells. Two separate 5′-RACE RT-PCRs were performed using the following pairs of reverse primers: set 1, primers TRG B2 (5′-TTAGGGGGAGTAGAATCTTCCA-3′) and TRG B1 (5′-AAATAGAATGGTATTGGTTACGTT-3′); set 2, primers TRG B4 (5′-TTTTCCAATCCTAATATGAATTTTG-3′) and TRG B3 (5′-GATGTTTGTTTTGTCTATATGAAGT-3′). The eLONGase Amplification System (Invitrogen) was used in the PCRs to enhance the fidelity of the PCR amplification. Gel-eluted 5′-RACE PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector and sequenced by the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill Automated DNA Sequencing Facility. Protein analyses were performed using GCG Wisconsin Sequence Package Analysis, ClustalW 1.8, ESPript 2.0, and other ExPASy biology server programs. A modification of the protocol by Srivastava et al. (38Srivastva K.K. Cable E.E. Bonkovsky H.L. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 226-227PubMed Google Scholar) was performed. NRP-152 cells were plated in 150-mm culture dishes (6 × 106 cells/dish) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 1% calf serum, 15 mm HEPES, 0.1 μmdexamethasone, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, with four dishes used for each treatment. After the cells attached for 24 h, a subset of cells was treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 24 h (or vehicle, 4 mm HCl, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The cells were trypsinized, washed in cold PBS, and resuspended in 4 ml of HB buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100) and Dounce-homogenized (pestle A, 10 strokes). The homogenate was diluted 1:1 with PB buffer (25% glycerol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm DTT) and centrifuged 15 min at 1500 rpm. The nuclei were resuspended in 200 μl of NSB buffer (25% glycerol, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT) per 108 cells. For each nuclear run-on reaction, 3–5 × 107 nuclei were resuspended in wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 40% glycerol, and 2.5 mmDTT) to a final volume of 200 μl, combined with 200 μl of 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 200 units/ml RNasin, 1 mm CTP, 1 mm GTP, 2 mm ATP, 2 μm UTP, and 5 mm DTT), 20 μl of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 1 h at 26 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 μl of RNAzol and 160 μl of phenol/chloroform and incubated on ice for 5 min. After centrifuging (12,000 × g for 5 min), the aqueous layer was combined with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. RNA was pelleted at 16,000 × g, resuspended in TE buffer containing 0.1% SDS, and reprecipitated with 100% ethanol. The RNA was dissolved in TE buffer and passed through a Quick Spin G-25 Sephadex column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The labeled RNA, diluted to 1 × 106 cpm/ml in prehybridization/hybridization buffer (3× SSC, 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA), was incubated at 60 °C overnight with Nytran membranes slot-blotted with 1 μg each of cDNA and prehybridized for 4 h at 60 °C. The membranes were then washed (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 30 min at room temperature; 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 30 min at 60 °C; 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 60 min at 60 °C; 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 30 min at 60 °C) and exposed to a phosphor screen. ImageQuant was used to quantitate differences in mRNA expression. Nytran membranes used contained cDNA probes for trespin and β-actin. The 1.17-kb trespin cDNA probe was designed to hybridize to bases 79–1251 of trespin mRNA, whereas the 0.35-kb β-actin probe was complementary to exons 2 and 3 of the rat β-actin gene. A 1.4-kb fragment of the pcDNA3 expression vector, prepared by digestion with AvaII, was also loaded for nonspecific DNA binding. Reverse transcription was performed using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers (GeneAmp; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 0.2 μg of total RNA from each tissue. The cDNA was then PCR-amplified (40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s) using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (GeneAmp). The sense (5′-ACCCTCACTGCAAAAATCCTC-3′) and antisense (5′-CTGACTGGAGGTCATAACTCTCC-3′) primers used in these reactions were designed to synthesize a 629-bp product. The resulting products were resolved through a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.72 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The hemagglutinin tag and translational start site was excised from hemagglutinin-pcDNA3 by digestion with HindIII and BamHI and replaced with 5′-HindIII-Kozak-FLAG-BamHI-3′ cDNA made by annealing complementary oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). Trespin (codons 2 to stop) were amplified with primers containing BamHI and EcoRI ends and ligated to BamHI- and EcoRI-digested pcDNA3-FLAG to generate pcDNA3-FLAG-trespin. pCEP4-FLAG-trespin was generated by excision of FLAG-trespin from pcDNA3-FLAG-trespin using completeNotI digestion, followed by limited digestion withHindIII and ligation to HindIII- andNotI-digested pCEP4. The bomapin coding sequence (codons 2 to stop) was PCR-amplified from THP-1 total RNA with primers containing BamHI and ClaI ends and ligated intoBamHI and ClaI-digested pcDNA-FLAG to generate pcDNA3-FLAG-bomapin. Constructs were sequenced for confirmation. 35S-Labeled trespin and bomapin were generated using a T7-coupled in vitrotranscription/translation TnT® kit (Promega) with pcDNA3-FLAG-trespin (or pcDNA3-FLAG-bomapin) as template. 1 μl of in vitrotranscribed/translated (IVTT) reaction was combined with the indicated nanogram amounts of proteinases (plasmin, elastase, subtilisin A, papain, and thrombin from Sigma; 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated chymotrypsin andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin from Worthington) in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) in a total volume of 15 μl. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then heated to 100 °C for 10 min in the presence of 2% SDS and 100 mm DTT. Complexes were resolved in 4–12% NuPAGE gradient gels (Invitrogen) using 1× MOPS buffer (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose before exposing to a phosphor screen for 48 h. Images were generated by an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and ImageQuant Software. HEK293 cells (2.0 × 106/100-mm plate) were transfected with 10 μg of amino-terminal FLAG-tagged trespin in pCEP4 (Invitrogen) (pCEP4-FLAG-trespin) or pCEP4 control using a standard calcium phosphate co-precipitate method, and stable clones were selected with 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). A pool of stable clones expressing FLAG-trespin (or pCEP4 control) were grown to subconfluence in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 in 15 × 150-mm2 plates. Cells were lysed in NETT (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (Complete tablets without EDTA; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min before immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with each NETT and Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. FLAG-trespin was eluted at 4 °C from the resin with five 2-ml washes (30 min each) of 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline, concentrated to 1 ml with a YM-10 Centricon (Amresco) and dialyzed (10–14-kDa cut-off membrane) against 5 mm HEPES for 48 h (buffer changed every 16 h). Purified FLAG-trespin was quantified by a microtiter BCA protein assay (Pierce) and Coomassie Blue staining of a 4–12% NuPAGE gel, using bovine serum albumin standards. One 150-mm dish of stable transfected pCEP4-FLAG-trespin HEK293 cells were trypsinized, resuspended, and quantified. 25% of the cell suspension was used for whole lysate, and 75% was used for nuclear extract. For preparation of nuclear extract, cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Cells were incubated on ice for 20 min, homogenized with 10 passes through a 25-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended with 300 μl of lysis buffer. Samples were incubated for 1 h at −80 °C, thawed, and centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C; supernatant is the nuclear extract. For whole cell lysate, cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer, and immediately incubated at −80 °C for 1 h. The thawed lysate was then centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C; supernatant is the whole cell lysate. The same volume of nuclear extract and whole cell lysate (equal number of nuclei and whole cells per ml) was subjected to Western blot analysis, and FLAG-trespin was detected as mentioned above. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression (clone NA03, 1:250; Oncogene Research) was used as loading control. The secretion of trespin from HEK293-FLAG-trespin cells was compared with the content of total cellular FLAG-trespin as follows. Conditioned medium (treated with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture) and whole cell lysate (treated similarly) from 107 cells were each mixed overnight with 50 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose. Resin was then washed extensively with PBS plus 1% Triton-X-100 and eluted with a total of 0.2 ml of 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide, as described by the manufacturer. Equal volumes of each eluted fraction were analyzed by Western blot. 0.5 μg of purified FLAG-trespin was suspended in 20 μl of PBS and heated to the indicated temperatures for 5 min (39Askew Y.S. Pak S.C. Luke C.J. Askew D.J. Cataltepe S. Mills D.R. Kato H. Lehoczky J. Dewar K. Birren B. Silverman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49320-49330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was combined with SDS loading buffer and resolved in a 4–12% NuPAGE gel with 1× MOPS buffer, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG (clone M1; Sigma) as described (40Chipuk J.E. Bhat M. Hsing A.Y., Ma, J. Danielpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26614-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Active plasmin concentration was determined by titrating the plasmin substrated-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (VLK-pNA; Sigma) to measure the turnover rate, using a spectrophotometric method similar to Chase and Shaw (41Chase T., Jr. Shaw E. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2212-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Plasmin (100 nm) was incubated with the indicated concentrations of FLAG-trespin (0–88.4 nm) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Residual plasmin activity was measured (A 405 with a Tecan Spectra Mini microplate reader and WinSelect 3.0 software) after a 20-min incubation with VLK-pNA (1 mm final concentration) at 37 °C. The stoichiometry of inhibition was determined by plotting the fractional activity (velocity of inhibited reaction divided by velocity of control reaction, V i /V o ) against the ratio of FLAG-trespin to plasmin ([I]0/[E]0). Linear regression analysis was performed by GraphPad Prism 3.0 to extrapolate the inhibitor and enzyme ratio resulting in 100% inhibition. Under pseudo-first order conditions, plasmin (100 nm), VLK-pNA (1 mm final concentration), and the indicated nanomolar concentrations of FLAG-trespin (0–88.4 nm) were combined simultaneously in PBS (total reaction volume was 100 μl). Plasmin activity proceeded at 37 °C, and the rate of product formation was recorded (A 405) as described above. Differential display RT-PCR was used to identify and isolate genes regulated by TGF-β1 in NRP-152 cells. This was done with RNA isolated from NRP-152 cells treated with or without 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h either alone or in the presence of 5 μg/ml insulin, which blocks several effects of TGF-β1.2Following differential display screening with 20 primer sets, we identified the 3′-end of a novel gene, which we initially named TGF-β-regulated gene 13 (TRG-13). Expression of TRG-13 is decreased by TGF-β1 in a manner that is blocked in the presence of insulin (Fig. 1 A, doublet is observed due to denaturing electrophoresis of double-stranded DNA). We confirmed these results by Northern blot analysis of total RNA from NRP-152 cells, using a [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe prepared by reamplification of the original 300-bp fragment eluted from the differential display gel. TRG-13 migrates as a single 1.4-kb transcript and is down-regulated as early as 5 h after TGF-β1 exposure (Fig. 1 B). To obtain full-length TRG-13 cDNA, we performed 5′-RACE RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 300-bp differential display product. From these reactions, we amplified a PCR product that contains the entire coding region of TRG-13. This product, totaling 1345 nucleotides, has 1.2 kb of coding region with 78 and 73 bp of 5′- and 3′-flanking untranslated regions, respectively. Analysis of this sequence with a nucleotide BLAST search revealed that TRG-13 shares high sequence similarity with serpins, with greatest similarity to the human bone marrow serpin bomapin (∼80%) (42Riewald M. Schleef R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26754-26757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). cDNA alignment of TRG-13 to bomapin allowed us to identify the open reading frame and the ATG codon representing the translation start site (43Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar). Although TRG-13 shares significant nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity with other serpins, it is down-regulated by TGF-β1, which contrasts with the dogmatic view of TGF-β influence on proteolysis (44Laiho M. Saksela O. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17467-17474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lund L.R. Riccio A. Andreasen P.A. Nielsen L.S. Kristensen P. Laiho M. Saksela O. Blasi F. Dano K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 has been shown to regulate mRNA expression through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. To determine whether the decrease in trespin mRNA produced by TGF-β1 occurred through loss of gene transcription, we measured trespin mRNA production in NRP-152 cells by nuclear run-on assay. The amount of trespin mRNA produced in NRP-152 cells treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h was ∼20% that of untreated control cells (Fig. 1 C), demonstrating that TGF-β1 lowers trespin mRNA levels by decreasing transcription of the trespin gene. For this reason, we have renamed this serpin trespin (forTGF-β-repressible serineproteinase inhibitor. Based on its deduced sequence, trespin consists of 397 amino acids (Fig.2 A) with a predicted molecular mass of 45.2 kDa. Whereas trespin protein has 72% sequence identity with human bomapin, it also shows about 40% identity with other serpins, including human PAI-2 (46Kruithof E.K. Enzyme. 1988; 40: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), chicken MENT (19Grigoryev S.A. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. J. Biol.
