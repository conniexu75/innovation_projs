Crystalline plasma monoamine oxidase was prepared from beef blood by a procedure involving ammonium sulfate precipi- tation, diethylaminoethyl cellulose and hydroxylapatite chroma- tography. 2. The recrystallized enzyme was homogeneous by electro- phoresis and at least 90% pure when examined in the ultra- centrifuge. The molecular weight was determined to be approxi- mately 255,000. 3. The crystalline enzyme was pink in color and showed an absorption maximum at about 480 mp. This maxi- mum was abolished by substrate as well as by sodium dithionite and was restored by oxygenation. 4. Some properties of the enzyme, such as stability, effects ionic strength, and pH, were investigated. 5. The substrate specificity was re-examined with the crystal- line preparations of the enzyme. Acknowledgments-The authors wish to thank Dr. L. H. Snyder for his support of this project and Miss P. Gee for her technical assistance."

By pairing such stimulation with a neutral auditory stimulus we were able to evoke electroencephalographic synchronization and sleep preparatory behavior to the presentation of a tone, and to temporal factors associated with the conditioning procedure."

Lipopolysaccharides h protected rats when they were administered in adjuvant did not protect when administered in saline. Mycobacterial wax D in saline was protective, while in adjuvant it produced arthritis. The degree of stimulation of a common tissue reaction may determine whether the result is protection or disease."

https://openalex.org/W2045236197,"THE effects of the inhalation of oxygen at greater than normal pressures have assumed greater importance as man's penetration into the depths of the sea has increased. It was Bert1 who for the first time revealed that, although oxygen at low pressures sustains life, the gas is toxic at high pressures. In their review of the subject, Stadie et al.2 conclude that the dominant symptoms of the action of oxygen at 0.8–2.0 atmospheres are respiratory, while at higher oxygen pressures central nervous system symptoms predominate. Several theories have been put forward to explain the toxic effects of oxygen at high pressures3, but no one theory is completely satisfactory."

In each case, a mild strain of tobacco mosaic virus (U2 or VM) was used to interfere with the establishment of infections by the common strain, U1. In this communication, competition between these same strains but involving infectious ribonucleic acid (RNA) and intact virus will be described."
https://openalex.org/W2070328580,"THE survey of radioactive nuclides of short half-lives had not been made in Japan until last autumn when a series of nuclear explosions was revived by the U.S.S.R. We have made measurements on the radioactivity of dust, foodstuffs, lungs and thyroid glands of man and animals since October 1961. Gamma-scintillation spectra of dust and leafy vegetable samples have all shown characteristic photopeaks of zirconium-95 + niobium-95, ruthenium-103, iodine-131 and barium-140."

https://openalex.org/W2017850335,"THE hæmadsorption test1,2 has been found to be a simple and useful means of detecting foci of infection by myxoviruses in tissue culture monolayers. The same response may be observed in cell cultures whether these viruses are non-cytopathic3 or cytopathic. Briefly, the technique consists of decanting the growth fluid and covering the monolayer with a 0.4 per cent saline suspension of guinea pig or chicken red blood cells and allowing hæmadsorption to proceed for 10 min. at 4° C. After two saline washes, the areas of hæmadsorption are examined under low magnification."
