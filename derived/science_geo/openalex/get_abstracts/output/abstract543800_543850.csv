In this study, we investigated the anti-proliferative effect of quercetin in two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), which differed in hormone receptor. IC50 value (37μM) of quercetin showed significant cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells, which was not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells even at 100μM of quercetin treatment. To study the response of cancer cells to quercetin, with respect to different hormone receptors, both the cell lines were treated with a fixed concentration (40μM) of quercetin. MCF-7 cells on quercetin treatment showed more apoptotic cells with G1 phase arrest. In addition, quercetin effectively suppressed the expression of CyclinD1, p21, Twist and phospho p38MAPK, which was not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. To analyse the molecular mechanism of quercetin in exerting an apoptotic effect in MCF-7 cells, Twist was over-expressed and the molecular changes were observed after quercetin administration. Quercetin effectively regulated the expression of Twist, in turn p16 and p21 which induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, quercetin induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells through suppression of Twist via p38MAPK pathway."

However, the roles of cancer specific lncRNA and its related competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network in hepatocellular cell carcinoma (HCC) are not fully understood. The lncRNA profiles in 372 HCC patients, including 372 tumor and 48 adjacent non-tumor liver tissues, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and NCBI GEO omnibus (GSE65485) were analyzed. Cancer specific lncRNAs (or HCC related lncRNAs) were identified and correlated with clinical features. Based on bioinformatics generated from miRcode, starBase, and miRTarBase, we constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network (ceRNA network) in HCC. We found 177 cancer specific lncRNAs in HCC (fold change ≥ 1.5, P < 0.01), 41 of them were also discriminatively expressed with gender, race, tumor grade, AJCC tumor stage, and AJCC TNM staging system. Six lncRNAs (CECR7, LINC00346, MAPKAPK5-AS1, LOC338651, FLJ90757, and LOC283663) were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (OS, log-rank P < 0.05). Collectively, our results showed the lncRNA expression patterns and a complex ceRNA network in HCC, and identified a complex cancer specific ceRNA network, which includes 14 lncRNAs and 17 miRNAs in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2165798163,"Background Endothelial activation plays a role in organ dysfunction in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) promotes vascular quiescence while angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) mediates microvascular leak. Circulating levels of Ang-1 and Ang-2 in patients with SIRS could provide insight on risks for organ dysfunction and death distinct from inflammatory proteins. In this study, we determined if biomarkers of endothelial activation and inflammation exhibit independent associations with poor outcomes in SIRS. Methods We studied 943 critically ill patients with SIRS admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of an academic medical center. We measured plasma levels of endothelial markers (Ang-1, Ang-2, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1)) and inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNFR-1)) within 24 hours of enrollment. We tested for associations between each marker and 28 day mortality, shock, and day 3 sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. For 28 day mortality, we performed sensitivity analysis for those subjects with sepsis and those with sterile inflammation. We used multivariate models to adjust for clinical covariates and determine if associations identified with endothelial activation markers were independent of those observed with inflammatory markers. Results Higher levels of all biomarkers were associated with increased 28 day mortality except levels of Ang-1 which were associated with lower mortality. After adjustment for comorbidities and sTNFR-1 concentration, a doubling of Ang-1 concentration was associated with lower 28 day mortality (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.81; p<0.01), shock (OR = 0.82; p<0.001), and SOFA score (β = -0.50; p<0.001), while Ang-2 concentration was associated with increased mortality (OR = 1.55; p<0.001), shock (OR = 1.51; p<0.001), and SOFA score (β = +0.63; p<0.001). sVCAM-1 was not independently associated with SIRS outcomes. Conclusions In critically ill patients with SIRS, early measurements of Ang-1 and Ang-2 are associated with death and organ dysfunction independently of simultaneously-measured markers of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2173513233,"The pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior of monoclonal antibodies in cynomolgus monkeys (cynos) is generally translatable to that in humans. Unfortunately, about 39% of the antibodies evaluated for PKs in cynos have fast nonspecific (or non-target-mediated) clearance (in-house data). An empirical model relating variable region (Fv) charge and hydrophobicity to cyno nonspecific clearance was developed to gauge the risk an antibody would have for fast nonspecific clearance in the monkey. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictability of this empirical model on cyno nonspecific clearance with antibodies specifically engineered to have either high or low Fv charge. These amino acid changes were made in the Fv region of two test antibodies, humAb4D5-8 and anti-lymphotoxin α. The humAb4D5-8 has a typical nonspecific clearance in cynos, and by making it more positively charged, the antibody acquires fast nonspecific clearance, and making it less positively charged did not impact its clearance. Anti-lymphotoxin α has fast nonspecific clearance in cynos, and making it more positively charged caused it to clear even faster, whereas making it less positively charged caused it to clear slower and within the typical range. These trends in clearance were also observed in two other preclinical species, mice and rats. The effect of modifying Fv charge on subcutaneous bioavailability was also examined, and in general bioavailability was inversely related to the direction of the Fv charge change. Thus, modifying Fv charge appears to impact antibody PKs, and the changes tended to correlate with those predicted by the empirical model.

https://openalex.org/W2293109251,"Stress responses are adaptive cellular programs that identify and mitigate potentially dangerous threats. Misfolded proteins are a ubiquitous and clinically relevant stress. Trivalent metalloids, such as arsenic, have been proposed to cause protein misfolding. Using tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry, we show that trivalent arsenic results in widespread reorganization of the cell from an anabolic to a catabolic state. Both major pathways of protein degradation, the proteasome and autophagy, show increased abundance of pathway components and increased functional output, and are required for survival. Remarkably, cells also showed a down-regulation of ribosomes at the protein level. That this represented an adaptive response and not an adverse toxic effect was indicated by enhanced survival of ribosome mutants after arsenic exposure. These results suggest that a major source of toxicity of trivalent arsenic derives from misfolding of newly synthesized proteins and identifies ribosome reduction as a rapid, effective, and reversible proteotoxic stress response."
https://openalex.org/W2103587901,"Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) experience among the highest rates of HIV infection in the United States. We conducted a community-based ethnography in New York City to identify the structural and environmental factors that influence BMSMs vulnerability to HIV and their engagement with HIV prevention services. Methods included participant observation at community-based organizations (CBOs) in New York City, in-depth interviews with 31 BMSM, and 17 key informant interviews. Our conceptual framework shows how creating and sustaining safe spaces could be a critical environmental approach to reduce vulnerability to HIV among BMSM. Participant observation, in-depth and key informant interviews revealed that fear and mistrust characterized men's relation to social and public institutions, such as churches, schools, and the police. This fear and mistrust created HIV vulnerability among the BMSM in our sample by challenging engagement with services. Our findings suggest that to be successful, HIV prevention efforts must address these structural and environmental vulnerabilities. Among the CBOs that we studied, ""safe spaces"" emerged as an important tool for addressing these environmental vulnerabilities. CBOs used safe spaces to provide social support, to address stigma, to prepare men for the workforce, and to foster a sense of community among BMSM. In addition, safe spaces were used for HIV and STI testing and treatment campaigns. Our ethnographic findings suggest that safe spaces represent a promising but so far under-utilized part of HIV prevention infrastructure. Safe spaces seem integral to high impact comprehensive HIV prevention efforts, and may be considered more appropriately as part of HIV capacity-building rather than being nested within program-specific funding structures."
https://openalex.org/W2157171850,"Akkermansia muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. are commensal microbes colonising the mucus gel layer of the colon. Both species have the capacity to utilise colonic mucin as a substrate. A. muciniphila degrades colonic mucin, while Desulfovibrio spp. metabolise the sulfate moiety of sulfated mucins. Altered abundances of these microorganisms have been reported in ulcerative colitis (UC). However their capacity to bind to human colonic mucin, and whether this binding capacity is affected by changes in mucin associated with UC, remain to be defined.Mucin was isolated from resected colon from control patients undergoing resection for colonic cancer (n = 7) and patients undergoing resection for UC (n = 5). Isolated mucin was purified and printed onto mucin microarrays. Binding of reference strains and three clinical isolates of A. muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. to purified mucin was investigated.Both A. muciniphila and Desulfovibro spp. bound to mucin. The reference strain and all clinical isolates of A. muciniphila showed increased binding capacity for UC mucin (p < .005). The Desulfovibrio reference strain showed increased affinity for UC mucin. The mucin binding profiles of clinical isolates of Desulfovibrio spp. were specific to each isolate. Two isolates showed no difference in binding. One UC isolate bound with increased affinity to UC mucin (p < .005).These preliminary data suggest that differences exist in the mucin binding capacity of isolates of A. muciniphila and Desulfovibrio spp. This study highlights the mucin microarray platform as a means of studying the ability of bacteria to interact with colonic mucin in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1841629412,"Objectives We studied the incidence and prevalence of, and co-factors for depression in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. Methods Depression-specific items were introduced in 2010 and prospectively collected at semiannual cohort visits. Clinical, laboratory and behavioral co-factors of incident depression among participants free of depression at the first two visits in 2010 or thereafter were analyzed with Poisson regression. Cumulative prevalence of depression at the last visit was analyzed with logistic regression. Results Among 4,422 participants without a history of psychiatric disorders or depression at baseline, 360 developed depression during 9,348 person-years (PY) of follow-up, resulting in an incidence rate of 3.9 per 100 PY (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5–4.3). Cumulative prevalence of depression during follow-up was recorded for 1,937/6,756 (28.7%) participants. Incidence and cumulative prevalence were higher in injection drug users (IDU) and women. Older age, preserved work ability and higher physical activity were associated with less depression episodes. Mortality (0.96 per 100 PY, 95% CI 0.83–1.11) based upon 193 deaths over 20,102 PY was higher among male IDU (2.34, 1.78–3.09), female IDU (2.33, 1.59–3.39) and white heterosexual men (1.32, 0.94–1.84) compared to white heterosexual women and homosexual men (0.53, 0.29–0.95; and 0.71, 0.55–0.92). Compared to participants free of depression, mortality was slightly elevated among participants with a history of depression (1.17, 0.94–1.45 vs. 0.86, 0.71–1.03, P = 0.033). Suicides (n = 18) did not differ between HIV transmission groups (P = 0.50), but were more frequent among participants with a prior diagnosis of depression (0.18 per 100 PY, 95%CI 0.10–0.31; vs. 0.04, 0.02–0.10; P = 0.003). Conclusions Depression is a frequent co-morbidity among HIV-infected persons, and thus an important focus of care."
https://openalex.org/W2259197633,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as key players in many physiologic and pathologic processes. Although many lncRNAs have been identified, few lncRNAs have been characterized functionally in aging. In this study, we used human fibroblast cells to investigate genome-wide lncRNA expression during cellular senescence. We identified 968 down-regulated lncRNAs and 899 up-regulated lncRNAs in senescent cells compared with young cells. Among these lncRNAs, we characterized a senescence-associated lncRNA (SALNR), whose expression was reduced during cellular senescence and in premalignant colon adenomas. Overexpression of SALNR delayed cellular senescence in fibroblast cells. Furthermore, we found that SALNR interacts with NF90 (nuclear factor of activated T-cells, 90 kDa), an RNA-binding protein suppressing miRNA biogenesis. We demonstrated that NF90 is a SALNR downstream target, whose inhibition led to premature senescence and enhanced expressions of senescence-associated miRNAs. Moreover, our data showed that Ras-induced stress promotes NF90 nucleolus translocation and suppresses its ability to suppress senescence-associated miRNA biogenesis, which could be rescued by SALNR overexpression. These data suggest that lncRNA SALNR modulates cellular senescence at least partly through changing NF90 activity.

Human fibroblasts have a limited ability to divide in culture, after which they remain viable for many weeks but fail to proliferate despite being given space, nutrients, or growth factors, which is known as senescence (1Hayflick L. The limited in vitro lifetime of human diploid cell strains.Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar). Cellular senescence could be triggered through two closely related processes: telomere erosion (replicative senescence) and exposure to damaging conditions (premature senescence) (2Kuilman T. Michaloglou C. Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. The essence of senescence.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2463-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar).

Epigenetic regulation by long noncoding RNAs.Science. 2012; 338: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). lncRNAs also have scaffolding or decoy function affecting gene transcription (9Lee J.T. Epigenetic regulation by long noncoding RNAs.Science. 2012; 338: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). In addition, lncRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression via modulating precursor mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, or translation (10Gong C.

Although a growing number of lncRNAs have been characterized in many physiologic and pathologic processes, their implications in senescence are largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify senescence-associated lncRNAs and intended to characterize their functions in premature senescence. Human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast 2BS cells (National Institute of Biological Products, Beijing, China) were isolated from female fetal lung fibroblast tissue, and they have been fully characterized previously (16Tang Z.

Ageing Dev. 1994; 73: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). WI-38 normal human embryo lung fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in the same manner as described for 2BS cells. Colon adenoma (n = 15) and adjacent normal tissue specimens (n = 15) were collected at Peking University First Hospital.

The microarray analysis was performed by KangChen Bio-tech (Shanghai, China). We selected candidates with a minimum of 2-fold changes and p < 0.05. Differentially expressed lncRNAs and their chromosomal locations were mapped by Prism version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The expression profile of miRNAs was determined using the stem-loop RT-PCR-based TaqMan human microRNA array (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (18Yu J. Li A. Hong S.M.

Relative miRNA levels were determined by ΔΔCt using endogenous controls. The scatter plot is a visualization method used for assessing expression variations between pairs. The values of the x and y axes in the scatter plot are the averaged normalized signal values of the group (log2-scaled). The green lines are -fold change (the default -fold change given is 2.0). The lncRNAs or miRNAs above the top green line and below the bottom green line indicate >2-fold change between pairs.

A score of <0.74 means that the sequence is probably non-coding. Scores between 0.74 and 0.95 mean that it is uncertain whether the sequence is coding or not. The following viral vectors were used in this study. pWZL-Hygro-Ras (H-RasV12) and pZsG-Puro were generously provided by Drs. Lixiang Xue and Xiaowei Zhang (Peking University Health Science Center), respectively. SALNR-pZSG was prepared as follows. The full-length SALNR sequence was amplified by PCR on the cDNA of 2BS cells with primers SALNR_F and SALNR_R (Table 1). The PCR fragment was cloned into the NotI/BamHI sites of pZsG-Puro vector. The full-length SALNR was also cloned into the NotI/BamHI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to generate sense SALNR-pcDNA3.1 vector. Antisense SALNR-pcDNA3.1 was constructed by subcloning the antisense of SALNR into BamHI/NotI sites of the pcDNA3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen). RNA interference was used to knock down SALNR and NF90 in young 2BS cells. The vector used for generating lentivirus was remolded pLL3.7, whose sequence expressing GFP was replaced by sequence expressing G418. The sense strands of shRNAs were as follows: shSALNR, 5′-GTGCTTGATAACTATATCT-3′; shNF90#1, 5′-GGTCTTCCTAGAGCGTCTAAA-3′; shNF90#2, 5′-CAGACTGCTACGGCTATCA-3′; shControl, 5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′. All transfections were carried out with LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To produce infectious viruses, the 293T packaging cell line was co-transfected with viral backbone plasmids and packaging plasmids (pMD2.G and psPAX2). After 48 h of transfection, the medium was collected, and the virus particles were concentrated by centrifugation. 2BS cells were plated on 60-mm plates 16–18 h before infection. Cells were infected with 5 × 104 viral particles/plate in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). After 12 h of incubation, the virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium, and on the next day, 2 μg/ml puromycin (for pZsG-Puro) or 500 μg/ml G418 (for pLL3.7-G418) was added to select stably infected cell populations. After 5 days of selection, stable cell pools were established, and expression was verified by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) or Western blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. qRT-PCR was performed using SuperscriptTM III transcriptase (Invitrogen) and THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of lncRNAU1 to -U5, lncRNAD1 to -D5, and microRNA primary transcript (pri-miRNA) was analyzed by qRT-PCR with the use of the primers shown in Table 1. GAPDH was used as an internal control. The mirVanaTM qRT-PCR miRNA detection kit and primer sets were purchased from Ambion (Foster City, CA). The cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using gene-specific primers according to the TaqMan microRNA assay protocol (Ambion). qRT-PCR was performed on cDNA generated from total miRNA using the mirVana qRT-PCR miRNA detection kit protocol (Ambion). Amplification and detection of specific products were performed using the ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) with a cycle profile according to the instructions of the mirVana qRT-PCR miRNA detection kit. As an internal control, U6 snRNA was used for RNA template normalization. The isolation of nucleoli fractionation was described previously (20Kotoglou P. Kalaitzakis A. Vezyraki P. Tzavaras T.

The primary anti-β-actin, anti-lamin B, and anti-fibrillarin antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-NF90 antibody was from BD Biosciences. Anti-NF45 antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Anti-p16 and anti-p53 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma. Detection of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity and SAHF staining were performed as described previously (21Zhuo de X. Niu X.H. Chen Y.C. Xin D.Q. Guo Y.L. Mao Z.B. Vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1(VDUP1) is regulated by FOXO3A and miR-17–5p at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, respectively, in senescent fibroblasts.J. Biol.

BrdU was detected using a BrdU incorporation assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). For the cell proliferation assay, 4 × 105 cells were plated in 35-mm tissue dishes. Cells were cultured for up to the indicated days and then fixed and stained with crystal violet. Stain was extracted by treatment with 95% ethanol. Subsequently, A570 values were measured. Cells were washed with PBS, detached with 0.25% trypsin, and fixed with 75% ethanol overnight. After treatment with 1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma), cells were resuspended in PBS and stained with propidium iodide in the dark. Fluorescence was measured with a FACScan flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences). Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min and then incubated with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with antibodies specific for NF90 (BD Biosciences), fibrillarin (Cell Signaling Technology), or NF45 (Abcam) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS plus 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated with a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser-scanning microscope. The human colon adenoma and control non-adenoma samples were fixed in 10% formalin, routinely embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. Serial sections were deparaffinized in xylene and hydrated through graded concentrations of ethanol. Epitopes were retrieved using microwave in boiling Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 9.0, for 20 min. Blocking, incubations with primary antibodies, and incubations with secondary antibodies were carried out in the same manner as that of culture cells. To label the RNA probes, partial cDNA fragments of SALNR were amplified by PCR using the sequence-specific primers SALNR FISH_F and SALNR FISH_R (Table 1). The PCR product was inserted into pcDNA3.1(+) or pcDNA3.1(−) vector. The plasmid DNA was then linearized and used for transcription with T7 RNA polymerases to generate sense and antisense probes with the FISH tag RNA multicolor kit (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Detection of RNA-FISH/IF was performed as described previously (22Dias A.P. Dufu K. Lei H. Reed R. A role for TREX components in the release of spliced mRNA from nuclear speckle domains.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 97Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sense SALNR-pcDNA3.1(+) and antisense SALNR-pcDNA3.1(−) were linearized with the corresponding restriction enzymes used to clone the vector at the 3′-end to obtain the template DNAs for in vitro transcription. An RNA pull-down assay was performed as described previously (23Tsai M.C. Manor O. Wan Y. Mosammaparast N. Wang J.K. Lan F. Shi Y. Segal E. Chang H.Y. Long noncoding RNA as modular scaffold of histone modification complexes.Science. 2010; 329: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). The retrieved protein was detected by silver staining or Western blotting. Protein bands differently visualized in sense SALNR compared with antisense were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. An RIP assay was carried out using the Magna RIPTM RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The antibody used for RIP was anti-NF90 (BD Biosciences). The co-precipitated RNAs were purified with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and detected by qRT-PCR. Cells were treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D. After the indicated incubation period, total RNA was isolated for qRT-PCR as described before. The ratio of the RNA level for SALNR relative to that for GAPDH before actinomycin D treatment was defined as 100%, and the half-life of lncRNA SALNR was calculated from the time period required for the SALNR RNA to undergo a reduction to one-half of its initial abundance. FLAG-NF90 was prepared as follows. The full-length NF90 sequence was amplified by PCR on the cDNA of 2BS cells with primers NF90F_F and NF90F_R (Table 1). The PCR fragment was then cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pCMV-Tag2B vector. Genomic DNA was extracted from colon adenoma and non-adenoma samples using the QIAamp DNA microkit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. KRAS mutation analysis at codons 12 and 13 was performed using direct sequencing of a fragment containing codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene using primers KRAS_F and KRAS_R (Table 1). These cover the length of the KRAS gene and derive a DNA fragment product of 116 base pairs. BRAF mutation analysis at codon 600 was performed using direct sequencing of a fragment containing codon 600 of the BRAF gene using primers BRAF_F and BRAF_R (Table 1). These cover the length of BRAF gene and derive a DNA fragment product of 251 base pairs. Results are expressed as means ± S.D., and the error bars represent S.D. values from three independent experiments unless otherwise indicated. The statistical significance of differences in the experimental data were analyzed using the two-sample Student's t test (p < 0.05 (*) was regarded as significant). To search for lncRNAs that are associated with senescence, we used the lncRNA microarray to profile lncRNA expression in replicative senescent (divided more than 60 times) and young human 2BS fibroblast. We identified 1,867 lncRNAs (with a ≥2.0-fold change and p < 0.05) in replicative senescent cells compared with young cells, among which 899 were up-regulated and 968 were down-regulated in senescent cells (Fig. 1, A and B). We then picked the five most up-regulated (U1–U5) or down-regulated (D1–D5) lncRNAs for validation (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, the results from real-time PCR were consistent with microarray data. Because of their low abundance, lncRNAU1, lncRNAU4, lncRNAD2, and lncRNAD4 were not studied further. To ensure that the expression change of lncRNAs was senescence-specific, we analyzed the expression of lncRNAs in quiescent and premature senescent cells. The senescence in quiescent and premature senescent cells was quantified and validated by measurement of SA-β-gal activity, SAHF formation, cells incorporating BrdU, and the expression of p16 and p53 (Fig. 2, A–D). For the six selected lncRNAs, similar expression changes were observed in Ras- or H2O2-induced premature senescent cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Interestingly, serum-deprived quiescent cells exhibited a similar change of lncRNAU2, -U3, -D1, and -D5 expression, suggesting that expression change in these four lncRNAs is not senescence-specific (Fig. 2, E and F). Both lncRNAU5 and -D3 expressions did not change in serum-deprived quiescent cells compared with young cells, suggesting that these two lncRNA expression changes were associated with senescence rather than growth arrest (Fig. 2, E and F). In this study, we focused on lncRNAD3 and designated it as SALNR (senescence-associated long non-coding RNA). Decreased expression of SALNR also was observed in senescent WI-38 cells (Fig. 2G), suggesting that SALNR down-regulation is not unique to 2BS cells. To obtain the complete structure of the SALNR gene, we performed 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE using gene-specific primers (Fig. 3A). The 3,788-bp SALNR cDNA contains a putative TATA box (TCTTTTAAAT) at −29 bp upstream of the putative transcription start site, without any introns. The full-length cDNA is mapped to 10q23.33 positive strand (NCBI36/hg18). By using the NCBI ORF finder program, we predicted multiple stop codons and several short open reading frames (ORFs) (<201 nucleotides) in SALNR full-length transcript (Fig. 3B). The TestCode value of SALNR is 0.386, which suggests an ncRNA. Furthermore, phylogenetic conservation analysis showed that SALNR was not conservative among humans, dogs, horses, mice, rats, and chickens (Fig. 3C), which appears to be a common feature for most lncRNAs.FIGURE 2Expression of lncRNAs in senescent fibroblasts. The activity of SA-β-gal (A), SAHF formation (B), percentage of cells incorporating BrdU (C), and expression of p16 and p53 protein (D) were detected in young, quiescent, replicative senescent, H2O2-induced senescent, and Ras-induced senescent 2BS cells. Quiescent cells were incubated in medium containing 0.2% serum for 48 h. H2O2-induced senescent cells were treated with a sublethal dose (200 μm H2O2) for 2 h.

SALNR overexpression resulted in a decrease of SAHF formation (Fig. 4B), a decreased activity of SA-β-gal (Fig. 4C), decreased expression of p16 and p53 protein (Fig. 4D), and an increase in the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU (Fig. 4E). The cell proliferation assay showed that SALNR overexpression prevented cells from entering Ras-induced senescence, and cells maintained proliferation (Fig. 4F). In addition, SALNR overexpression resulted in an increase of S compartment and a decrease in G0/G1 compartment compared with control (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, we found that SALNR overexpression extended the life span of replicative senescent cells (Fig. 5A), accompanied by decreased SAHF formation (Fig. 5B), decreased SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 5C), decreased expression of p16 and p53 protein (Fig. 5D), and an increase in the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU (Fig. 5E). These findings suggest that SALNR plays an important role in cellular senescence.FIGURE 5SALNR overexpression delays replicative senescence. 48PD replicative senescent 2BS cells were infected with SALNR-pZSG or control.

We show that mouse and human ABHD6 degrade bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) with high specific activity.

Up to now, little has been known about the catabolism of this lipid. Our data demonstrate that ABHD6 is responsible for ∼90% of the BMP hydrolase activity detected in the liver and that knockdown of ABHD6 increases hepatic BMP levels. Tissue fractionation and live-cell imaging experiments revealed that ABHD6 co-localizes with late endosomes/lysosomes. The enzyme is active at cytosolic pH and lacks acid hydrolase activity, implying that it degrades BMP exported from acidic organelles or de novo-formed BMP.

https://openalex.org/W2239315422,"Stroke is the second-leading cause of death worldwide, and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is the only drug used for a limited group of stroke patients in the acute phase. Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD), a traditional Chinese medicine prescription, has long been used for improving neurological functional recovery in stroke. In this study, we characterized the therapeutic effect of TPA and BHD in a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CIR) injury mouse model using multiplex proteomics approach. After the iTRAQ-based proteomics analysis, 1310 proteins were identified from the mouse brain with <1% false discovery rate. Among them, 877 quantitative proteins, 10.26% (90/877), 1.71% (15/877), and 2.62% (23/877) of the proteins was significantly changed in the CIR, BHD treatment, and TPA treatment, respectively. Functional categorization analysis showed that BHD treatment preserved the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Alb, Fga, and Trf), suppressed excitotoxicity (Grm5, Gnai, and Gdi), and enhanced energy metabolism (Bdh), thereby revealing its multiple effects on ischemic stroke mice. Moreover, the neurogenesis marker doublecortin was upregulated, and the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and Tau was inhibited, which represented the neuroprotective effects. However, TPA treatment deteriorated BBB breakdown. This study highlights the potential of BHD in clinical applications for ischemic stroke."

Participants included Network oversight committee members (n = 38) and frontline providers (n = 1,790). Network committee members used a modified RAND/University of California Appropriateness Methodology, to serially propose, rate (validated 9 point scale) and revise potential knowledge-to-care gaps as priorities for improvement. The priorities were sent to frontline providers for evaluation. Results were relayed back to all frontline providers for feedback.Initially, 68 knowledge-to-care gaps were proposed, rated and revised by the committee (n = 32 participants) over 3 rounds of review and resulted in 13 proposed priorities for improvement. Then, 1,103 providers (62% response rate) evaluated the priorities, and rated 9 as 'necessary' (median score 7-9). Several factors were associated with rating priorities as necessary in multivariable logistic regression, related to the provider (experience, teaching status of ICU) and topic (strength of supporting evidence, potential to benefit the patient, potential to improve patient/family experience, potential to decrease costs).A community-based participatory research approach engaged a diverse group of stakeholders to identify 9 priorities for improving the quality and value of critical care.

https://openalex.org/W2205500978,"Cigarette use is an independent risk factor for the development of erectile dysfunction (ED). While the association between chronic smoking and ED is well established, the fundamental mechanism(s) of cigarette-related ED are incompletely understood, partly due to no reliable animal model of smoking-induced ED. The present study was designed to validate an in vivo rat model of chronic cigarette-induced ED. Forty 12-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups. Ten rats served as control group and were exposed only to room air. The remaining 30 rats were passively exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) for 4 weeks (n = 10), 12 weeks (n = 10), and 24 weeks (n = 10). At the 24-week time point all rats were assessed with intracavernous pressure (ICP) during cavernous nerve electrostimulation. Blood and urine were collected to measure serum testosterone and oxidative stress, respectively. Corporal tissue was assessed by Western blot for neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Penile tissues were subjected to immunohistochemistry for endothelial, smooth muscle, and apoptotic content. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was significantly higher in 24-week cigarette exposed animals compared to the control animals. Mean ICP/MAP ratio and cavernosal smooth muscle/endothelial contents were significantly lower in the 12- and 24-week rats compared to control animals. Oxidative stress was significantly higher in the 24-week cigarette exposed group compared to control animals. Mean nNOS expression was significantly lower, and apoptotic index significantly higher, in CS-exposed animals compared to control animals. These findings indicate that the rat model exposure to CS increases apoptosis and oxidative stress and decreases nNOS, endothelial and smooth muscle contents, and ICP in a dose dependent fashion. The rat model is a useful tool for further study of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of CS-related ED."
https://openalex.org/W2125674870,"Pineal organs of lower vertebrates contain several kinds of photosensitive molecules, opsins that are suggested to be involved in different light-regulated physiological functions. We previously reported that parapinopsin is an ultraviolet (UV)-sensitive opsin that underlies hyperpolarization of the pineal photoreceptor cells of lower vertebrates to achieve pineal wavelength discrimination. Although, parapinopsin is phylogenetically close to vertebrate visual opsins, it exhibits a property similar to invertebrate visual opsins and melanopsin: the photoproduct of parapinopsin is stable and reverts to the original dark states, demonstrating the nature of bistable pigments. Therefore, it is of evolutionary interest to identify a phototransduction cascade driven by parapinopsin and to compare it with that in vertebrate visual cells. Here, we showed that parapinopsin is coupled to vertebrate visual G protein transducin in the pufferfish, zebrafish, and lamprey pineal organs. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that parapinopsins activated transducin in vitro in a light-dependent manner, similar to vertebrate visual opsins. Interestingly, transducin activation by parapinopsin was provoked and terminated by UV- and subsequent orange-lights irradiations, respectively, due to the bistable nature of parapinopsin, which could contribute to a wavelength-dependent control of a second messenger level in the cell as a unique optogenetic tool. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that parapinopsin was colocalized with Gt2 in the teleost, which possesses rod and cone types of transducin, Gt1, and Gt2. On the other hand, in the lamprey, which does not possess the Gt2 gene, in situ hybridization suggested that parapinopsin-expressing photoreceptor cells contained Gt1 type transducin GtS, indicating that lamprey parapinopsin may use GtS in place of Gt2. Because it is widely accepted that vertebrate visual opsins having a bleaching nature have evolved from non-bleaching opsins similar to parapinopsin, these results implied that ancestral bistable opsins might acquire coupling to the transducin-mediated cascade and achieve light-dependent hyperpolarizing response of the photoreceptor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1832533614,"Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is a fundamental cellular process in eukaryotic cells.

RBBP4 accelerates the release of importin β1 from importin α via competitive binding to the importin β-binding domain of importin α in the presence of RanGTP. Therefore, it facilitates importin α/β-mediated nuclear import. We showed that the importin α/β pathway is down-regulated in replicative senescent cells, concomitant with a decrease in RBBP4 level. Knockdown of RBBP4 caused both suppression of nuclear transport and induction of cellular senescence. This is the first report to identify a factor that competes with importin β1 to bind to importin α, and it demonstrates that the loss of this factor can trigger cellular senescence.

Through the application of virtual microtomography (μCT) and 3D rendering software, we describe aspects of the gross anatomy of the brain and labyrinth region in the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri and compare this to previous accounts. Unexpected characters in this specimen include short olfactory peduncles connecting the olfactory bulbs to the telencephalon, and an oblong telencephalon. Furthermore, we illustrate the endocast (the mould of the internal space of the neurocranial cavity) of Neoceratodus, also describing and quantifying the brain-endocast relationship in a lungfish for the first time. Overall, the brain of the Australian lungfish closely matches the size and shape of the endocast cavity housing it, filling more than four fifths of the total volume. The forebrain and labyrinth regions of the brain correspond very well to the endocast morphology, while the midbrain and hindbrain do not fit so closely. Our results cast light on the gross neural and endocast anatomy in lungfishes, and are likely to have particular significance for palaeoneurologists studying fossil taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2220881036,"Post-translational modification of proteins is a ubiquitous mechanism of signal transduction in all kingdoms of life. One such modification is addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine to serine or threonine residues, known as O-GlcNAcylation. This unusual type of glycosylation is thought to be restricted to nucleocytoplasmic proteins of eukaryotes and is mediated by a pair of O-GlcNAc-transferase and O-GlcNAc hydrolase enzymes operating on a large number of substrate proteins. Protein O-GlcNAcylation is responsive to glucose and flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Thus, a close relationship is thought to exist between the level of O-GlcNAc proteins within and the general metabolic state of the cell. Although isolated apparent orthologues of these enzymes are present in bacterial genomes, their biological functions remain largely unexplored. It is possible that understanding the function of these proteins will allow development of reductionist models to uncover the principles of O-GlcNAc signaling.

The protein kinase complement of the human genome.Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6224) Google Scholar). These enzyme pairs are characterized by a high specificity for a small number of target proteins that they modify. In contrast, modification of cytoplasmic proteins with a single O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) 4The abbreviations used are:O-GlcNAcO-linked N-acetylglucosamineOGTO-GlcNAc-transferaseOGAO-GlcNAcaseTPRtetratricopeptide repeatCpC. perfringensTtT. terrenumDMSOdimethyl sulfoxide4MU-GlcNAc4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidehTab1human TAK1-binding protein 1GT41glycosyltransferase 41GH84glycoside hydrolase 84hOGThuman OGThOGAhuman OGAAc4-5S-GlcNAcperacetylated 5S-GlcNAcr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationTLRtetratricopeptide-like regionOgO. granulosus. is a regulatory post-translational modification that is dependent on a single O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT), which transfers the O-GlcNAc moiety onto target proteins, and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which can reverse this process (4.Vocadlo D.J.

This unusual type of protein glycosylation occurs exclusively on nucleocytoplasmic proteins in metazoa (5.Holt G.D. Hart G.W. The subcellular distribution of terminal N-acetylglucosamine moieties.

Since its discovery 30 years ago during a study of nucleoporins (7.Torres C.-R. Hart G.W.

The hexosamine signaling pathway: deciphering the “O-GlcNAc code.”.Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re13Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc is a small, uncharged moiety, and the molecular basis of its impact on protein function is not well understood. However, there is evidence that protein O-GlcNAcylation can affect protein localization (9.Park J. Han D. Kim K. Kang Y. Kim Y.

OGT uses a form of substrate-assisted catalysis to transfer N-acetylglucosamine from the sugar-nucleotide donor UDP-GlcNAc onto specific serine or threonine residues of the substrate (24.Schimpl M.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11952-11957Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), although the relationship between the O-GlcNAcase and acetyltransferase activities of this enzyme is not understood. One of the key questions in the O-GlcNAc signaling field is how two single enzymes, OGA and OGT, can together build a dynamic and inducible O-GlcNAc proteome of over a thousand O-GlcNAc proteins, whereas over 600 kinases/phosphatases are needed to carefully regulate site-specific protein phosphorylation in response to extracellular cues. Elucidating this essential mechanism is challenging in the model organisms where the greatest progress in understanding this modification has been achieved to date (i.e. mouse and Drosophila) and where OGT knock-outs are unfortunately lethal (19.Sinclair D.A. Syrzycka M. Macauley M.S. Rastgardani T. Komljenovic I. Vocadlo D.J. Brock H.W. Honda B.M.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Thus, discovery of a much simpler, reductionist model system to study the basic mechanisms of O-GlcNAc signaling would be of considerable benefit. O-GlcNAcylation is predominantly thought of as restricted to metazoa as OGT and OGA were initially identified across the Animalia kingdom (20.Hart G.W. Slawson C. Ramirez-Correa G. Lagerlof O.

Two OGT orthologues, SPINDLY and SECRET AGENT, were subsequently identified in plants and are implicated in the gibberellin signaling pathway (33.Thornton T.M. Swain S.M. Olszewski N.E.

Heynh. have overlapping functions necessary for gamete and seed development.Genetics. 2002; 161: 1279-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two OGTs show a level of functional redundancy, and disruption of both genes is lethal (34.Hartweck L.M. Scott C.L. Olszewski N.E. Two O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase genes of Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh. have overlapping functions necessary for gamete and seed development.Genetics. 2002; 161: 1279-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SECRET AGENT was shown to self-O-GlcNAcylate in vitro when expressed in Escherichia coli (34.Hartweck L.M. Scott C.L. Olszewski N.E.

Heynh. have overlapping functions necessary for gamete and seed development.Genetics. 2002; 161: 1279-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, other modified plant proteins remain to be identified, and there is currently no evidence of a functional OGA homologue in plant genomes. Strikingly, many prokaryotic genomes of various genera appear to encode orthologues of both OGT and OGA. Some of these orthologues have been widely used in structural and enzymatic approaches to understand the molecular mechanism of O-GlcNAc transfer and hydrolysis (21.Clarke A.J. Hurtado-Guerrero R.

Several are secreted pathogenicity factors, like the NagJ from Clostridium perfringens (39.Shimizu T. Ohtani K. Hirakawa H. Ohshima K. Yamashita A. Shiba T. Ogasawara N. Hattori M. Kuhara S.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) (hereafter CpOGA), precluding a role in modulating intracellular O-GlcNAc signaling. A noteworthy exception is the recently identified OGT homologue found in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongates that appears to be involved in phosphorus retention within the cell, and genetic disruption causes the cells to aggregate (40.Sokol K.A. Olszewski N. The putative eukaryotic-like O-GlcNAc transferase of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 hydrolyzes UDP-GlcNAc and is involved in multiple cellular processes.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 197: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The underlying biological mechanisms of these phenotypes are not understood, and the organism lacks a predicted OGA homologue, precluding the existence of a dynamic O-GlcNAc proteome in this organism. It is possible that the single S. elongates OGT resembles the O-GlcNAcylation system found in plants. In this report, we describe the identification of the first complete putative bacterial protein O-GlcNAcylation system, found in the soil thermophile Thermobaculum terrenum (41.Botero L.M. Brown K.B. Brumefield S. Burr M. Castenholz R.W. Young M. McDermott T.R. Thermobaculum terrenum gen. nov., sp. nov.: a non-phototrophic gram-positive thermophile representing an environmental clone group related to the Chloroflexi (green non-sulfur bacteria) and Thermomicrobia.Arch. Microbiol. 2004; 181: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). By means of protein sequence searches, we identified orthologues of both OGT and OGA in this organism. We show that both proteins are expressed in T. terrenum under laboratory conditions and that both proteins are retained in the cytoplasm. The OGA orthologue is active in vitro on both a synthetic substrate and O-GlcNAc proteins, and treatment of T. terrenum with an OGT-specific inhibitor leads to growth inhibition. Unfortunately, throughout our experimental procedures, we were unable to identify proteins modified by the OGT homologue or detect in vitro activity of the recombinant protein. Finally, we use crystal structures of both enzymes to demonstrate conservation of the catalytic machinery, suggesting that this may represent a bona fide O-GlcNAc system orthologous to that found in metazoa. T. terrenum strain YNP1 was obtained from ATCC. T. terrenum was routinely maintained at 65 °C with agitation in NYZ broth (10 g of casamino acids (Thermo Fisher), 5 g of yeast extract (Merck), 5 g of NaCl/liter) solidified with 0.8% Gelzan CM Gelrite (Sigma-Aldrich) when necessary. T. terrenum cells were streaked from a glycerol stock onto an NYZ plate and incubated at 65 °C for 5 days. A single colony was inoculated into 5 ml of NYZ broth supplemented with 0.2% glucose, and the starter culture was incubated at 65 °C for 2 days with vigorous agitation and used to inoculate experimental cultures. Bacillus subtilis strain 168 (Marburg) was routinely maintained and propagated in LB medium (10 g of Bacto tryptone (BD Biosciences), 5 g of yeast extract (Merck), 10 g of NaCl/liter). E. coli was routinely maintained in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin as required at 37 °C. Primers and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table 1. The coding frames of Tter_2822 and Tter_0116 genes were amplified using appropriate primer pairs from the genomic DNA of T. terrenum prepared using phenol/chloroform extraction. The amplified fragments were cloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare) using a restriction-free approach (42.van den Ent F. Löwe J. RF cloning: a restriction-free method for inserting target genes into plasmids.J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2006; 67: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using primers listed in Table 1 and verified by sequencing. All plasmids were cloned and maintained in E. coli DH5α.TABLE 1Plasmids and primers1 Restriction-free cloning primer fragments homologous to the vector are underlined.

The bases for site-directed mutagenesis substitutions are in bold. Full-length recombinant TtOGT and TtOGA proteins were expressed as N-terminally GST-tagged fusions in E. coli BL21. Transformed strains were grown in autoinduction medium at 37 °C with agitation until A600 0.3 at which point the temperature was lowered to 18 °C and incubation was continued overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C (35 min 4,500 × g). The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml DNase I and protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm PMSF, 5 mm leupeptin) and disrupted using a continuous flow cell disruptor (three passes, 15,000 p.s.i.). After removing the cell debris (45 min, 30,000 × g), the supernatant was subjected to glutathione affinity chromatography using GSH-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the desired product protein was liberated using PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). The cleaved protein was concentrated using centrifugal concentrators (Sartorius) and loaded onto a 300-ml prepacked SuperdexTM 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The protein peak was pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml for TtOGT and 60 mg/ml for TtOGA and used fresh in further experiments. For the purpose of raising polyclonal antibodies, samples of the purified proteins were submitted to Dundee Cell Products for antibody production in rabbits. The antibodies were affinity-purified against the full-length purified proteins as described previously (43.Ostrowski A. Mehert A. Prescott A. Kiley T.B. Stanley-Wall N.R. YuaB functions synergistically with the exopolysaccharide and TasA amyloid fibers to allow biofilm formation by Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 4821-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To establish T. terrenum growth kinetics, 50-ml cultures were inoculated to an A600 of 0.025 from the starter cultures. The A600 of cultures was measured twice a day. To identify localization of TtOGT and TtOGA, 10-ml samples were removed from each culture, and the cell pellet was separated from the medium supernatant by centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g. The decanted supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter to remove any unpelleted cells. The cells were lysed by sonication in 500 μl of PBS, and the medium fraction was concentrated using VivaSpin 20 10-kDa-molecular mass cutoff spin concentrators (Sartorius) to 200 μl. To remove medium contaminants, the concentrated fraction was precipitated with methanol/chloroform and dissolved in 100 μl of PBS with 1% SDS, yielding a 400-fold concentration factor. The concentration of total protein in each of the samples was estimated by Coomassie staining of the SDS-PAGE gel. Standardized samples were resolved by10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using a Novex Semi-Dry Blotter, and the membranes were blocked in 3% milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. The primary purified antibodies against TtOGT (dilution, 1:100), TtOGA (dilution, 1:1,000), and B. subtilis RpoD (44.Cairns L.S. Marlow V.L. Kiley T.B. Birchall C. Ostrowski A. Aldridge P.D.

To assess the effects of peracetylated 5S-GlcNAc (Ac4-5S-GlcNAc) on growth of T. terrenum, the cells were inoculated to A600 0.025 in 5 ml of NYZ broth supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 15–1,000 μm Ac4-5S-GlcNAc prepared in 100 μl of DMSO. Controls of cells treated with 100 μl of pure DMSO and untreated cells were included. The growth of cells was monitored by removing 100-μl samples and A600 measurement over the course of 92 h with sampling every 24 h from the moment of inoculation. Steady-state kinetics of wild type and mutant TtOGA were determined using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (4MU-GlcNAc; Sigma). 50-μl reaction mixtures contained 0.2 nm enzyme in TBS buffer supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml BSA and 56–1,600 μm substrate in 2% DMSO. The fluorescence of the product, 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU), was quantified using an FLX 800 microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Results were corrected for the background emission from the BSA, buffer, and the 4MU-GlcNAc, and the background-corrected data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism 5.0. To determine the IC50 of GlcNAcstatin G, 4 pm wild type TtOGA enzyme was incubated with the inhibitor (0.04–2,470 nm) for 1 min prior to starting the reaction by addition of the substrate. The substrate concentration was constant and equivalent to the Km determined from steady-state kinetics (90 μm). IC50 values were obtained by fitting the background-corrected fluorescence intensity data to a four-paramete"

Core-shell nanocapsules with an oily core and stabilized with phospholipids were used. This system was used with or without chitosan coating. In this work, we investigated the in vitro release behavior of capsaicin-loaded formulations in different physiological media (including simulated saliva fluid). We also evaluated the influence of encapsulation of capsaicin on the cell viability of buccal cells (TR146). To study the changes in pungency after encapsulation we carried out a sensory analysis with a trained panel of 24 students. The in vitro release study showed that the systems discharged capsaicin slowly in a monotonic manner and that the chitosan coating had an effect on the release profile. The cytotoxic response of TR146 cells to capsaicin at a concentration of 500 μM, which was evident for the free compound, was reduced following its encapsulation. The sensory study revealed that a chitosan coating results in a lower threshold of perception of the formulation. The nanoencapsulation of capsaicin resulted in attenuation of the sensation of pungency significantly. However, the presence of a chitosan shell around the nanoformulations did not mask the pungency, when compared with uncoated systems."
https://openalex.org/W2256912011,"Frugivory is a widespread mutualistic interaction in which frugivores obtain nutritional resources while favoring plant recruitment through their seed dispersal services. Nonetheless, how these complex interactions are organized in diverse communities, such as tropical forests, is not fully understood. In this study we evaluated the existence of plant-frugivore sub-assemblages and their phylogenetic organization in an undisturbed western Amazonian forest in Colombia. We also explored for potential keystone plants, based on network analyses and an estimate of the amount of fruit going from plants to frugivores. We carried out diurnal observations on 73 canopy plant species during a period of two years. During focal tree sampling, we recorded frugivore identity, the duration of each individual visit, and feeding rates. We did not find support for the existence of sub assemblages, such as specialized vs. generalized dispersal systems. Visitation rates on the vast majority of canopy species were associated with the relative abundance of frugivores, in which ateline monkeys (i.e. Lagothrix and Ateles) played the most important roles. All fruiting plants were visited by a variety of frugivores and the phylogenetic assemblage was random in more than 67% of the cases. In cases of aggregation, the plant species were consumed by only primates or only birds, and filters were associated with fruit protection and likely chemical content. Plants suggested as keystone species based on the amount of pulp going from plants to frugivores differ from those suggested based on network approaches. Our results suggest that in tropical forests most tree-frugivore interactions are generalized, and abundance should be taken into account when assessing the most important plants for frugivores."
https://openalex.org/W2109509923,"Wolbachia is the most widespread endosymbiotic bacterium that manipulates reproduction of its arthropod hosts to enhance its own spread throughout host populations. Infection with Wolbachia causes complete parthenogenetic reproduction in many Hymenoptera, producing only female offspring. The mechanism of such reproductive manipulation by Wolbachia has been extensively studied. However, the effects of Wolbachia symbiosis on behavioral traits of the hosts are scarcely investigated. The parasitoid wasp Asobara japonica is an ideal insect to investigate this because symbiotic and aposymbiotic strains are available: Wolbachia-infected Tokyo (TK) and noninfected Iriomote (IR) strains originally collected on the main island and southwest islands of Japan, respectively. We compared the oviposition behaviors of the two strains and found that TK strain females parasitized Drosophila melanogaster larvae more actively than the IR strain, especially during the first two days after eclosion. Removing Wolbachia from the TK strain wasps by treatment with tetracycline or rifampicin decreased their parasitism activity to the level of the IR strain. Morphological and behavioral analyses of both strain wasps showed that Wolbachia endosymbionts do not affect development of the host female reproductive tract and eggs, but do enhance host-searching ability of female wasps. These results suggest the possibility that Wolbachia endosymbionts may promote their diffusion and persistence in the host A. japonica population not only at least partly by parthenogenesis but also by enhancement of oviposition frequency of the host females."
https://openalex.org/W2169483854,"Candida glabrata is an apparently asexual haploid yeast that is phylogenetically closer to Saccharomyces cerevisiae than to Candida albicans. Its genome contains three MAT-like cassettes, MAT, which encodes either MATa or MATalpha information in different strains, and the additional loci, HML and HMR. The genome also contains an HO gene homolog, but this yeast has never been shown to switch mating-types spontaneously, as S. cerevisiae does. We have recently sequenced the genomes of the five species that, together with C. glabrata, make up the Nakaseomyces clade. All contain MAT-like cassettes and an HO gene homolog. In this work, we express the HO gene of all Nakaseomyces and of S. cerevisiae in C. glabrata. All can induce mating-type switching, but, despite the larger phylogenetic distance, the most efficient endonuclease is the one from S. cerevisiae. Efficient mating-type switching in C. glabrata is accompanied by a high cell mortality, and sometimes results in conversion of the additional cassette HML. Mortality probably results from the cutting of the HO recognition sites that are present, in HML and possibly HMR, contrary to what happens naturally in S. cerevisiae. This has implications in the life-cycle of C. glabrata, as we show that efficient MAT switching is lethal for most cells, induces chromosomal rearrangements in survivors, and that the endogenous HO is probably rarely active indeed."
https://openalex.org/W2269765452,"N1-methyl adenine (1-MeA) is formed in DNA by reaction with alkylating agents and naturally occurring methyl halides. The 1-MeA lesion impairs Watson-Crick base pairing and blocks normal DNA replication. Here we identify the translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (Pols) required for replicating through 1-MeA in human cells and show that TLS through this lesion is mediated via three different pathways in which Pols ι and θ function in one pathway and Pols η and ζ, respectively, function in the other two pathways. Our biochemical studies indicate that in the Polι/Polθ pathway, Polι would carry out nucleotide insertion opposite 1-MeA from which Polθ would extend synthesis. In the Polη pathway, this Pol alone would function at both the nucleotide insertion and extension steps of TLS, and in the third pathway, Polζ would extend from the nucleotide inserted opposite 1-MeA by an as yet unidentified Pol. Whereas by pushing 1-MeA into the syn conformation and by forming Hoogsteen base pair with the T residue, Polι would carry out TLS opposite 1-MeA, the ability of Polη to replicate through 1-MeA suggests that despite its need for Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding, Polη can stabilize the adduct in its active site. Remarkably, even though Pols η and ι are quite error-prone at inserting nucleotides opposite 1-MeA, TLS opposite this lesion in human cells occurs in a highly error-free fashion. This suggests that the in vivo fidelity of TLS Pols is regulated by factors such as post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, and possibly others.

Mouse embryonic fibroblast lines derived from ABH2 null mice are highly defective in repairing 1-MeA residues generated in response to methyl methanesulfonate treatment.

Previously, we reported on the genetic control of translesion synthesis (TLS) opposite UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts and opposite thymine glycol (Tg), which is the most common oxidation product of thymine (9Yoon J.H.

Of the two UV lesions, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer does not significantly affect the ability of two pyrimidines to form a correct W-C base pair with the purine bases, and it has only a modest effect on DNA structure (13Kemmink J.

The Tg lesion also has no significant effect on the ability of oxidized T to form a correct base pair with an A; however, because of the addition of hydroxyl groups at C5 and C6 on Tg, the damaged base becomes non-planar and that prevents the base 5′ to Tg from stacking above it (17Aller P.

Despite the fact that these DNA lesions differ vastly in their effects on DNA structure and on base pairing, they generate only ∼2% mutagenic TLS products in human cells (10Yoon J.-H. Bhatia G.

This is rather surprising in view of the fact that the various TLS DNA polymerases (Pols) synthesize DNA with a low fidelity (21Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Eukaryotic translesion synthesis DNA polymerases: specificity of structure and function.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Here we identify the TLS Pols that promote replication through the 1-MeA lesion in human cells and show that TLS opposite this lesion is mediated by three independent pathways, involving Pols ι and θ in one pathway and Pols η and ζ, respectively, in the other two pathways. The observation that similar to that opposite UV and Tg lesions, TLS opposite this W-C blocking lesion also occurs in a highly error-free manner reinforces the notion that the fidelity of TLS Pols is actively regulated in human cells. The 16-mer oligonucleotides containing an N1-methyl deoxyadenosine (Fig. 1A) were purchased from Trilink Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). The methods used by this company for the synthesis of 1-MeA-derived phosphoramidite and for its incorporation into oligonucleotide employ N6-chloroacetyl protection and controlled anhydrous deprotection conditions to prevent the formation of N6-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine via a Dimroth rearrangement (22Mikhailov S.N.

In the lacZ′ gene, the 1-MeA-containing DNA strand harbors an MfeI restriction site, and it encodes functional β-galactosidase (β-gal), whereas the opposite strand harbors an SpeI site containing a +1 frameshift, making it non-functional for β-gal. The 1-MeA containing strand carries the kanamycin gene (Kan+), whereas the other DNA strand has the kan− gene (Fig. 1B). The detailed method for construction of 1-MeA-containing plasmids was as described previously (11Yoon J.-H. Prakash L. Prakash S. Highly error-free role of DNA polymerase η in the replicative bypass of UV induced pyrimidine dimers in mouse and human cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Normal (MRC5) and XPV (XP30RO) human fibroblast cells were grown in DMEM media (GenDEPOT) with 10% FBS (GenDEPOT) and plated in 6-well plates at 70% confluence (approximately 3 × 105 cells per well). Cells were transfected with 100 pmol of siRNAs with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For the simultaneous siRNA knockdown of two genes, 100 pmol of siRNAs for each gene were mixed and transfected. After 48 h of incubation, the heteroduplex target vector DNA (1 μg) and 50 pmol of siRNA (second transfection) were cotransfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (Fig. 1C). After 30 h of incubation, plasmid DNA was rescued from cells by the alkaline lysis method and digested with DpnI to remove unreplicated plasmid DNA. The plasmid DNA was then transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue super competent cells (Stratagene). Transformed bacterial cells were diluted in 1 ml of SOC media (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and plated on LB/kan (25 μg/ml kanamycin, Sigma) plates containing 1 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (GenDEPOT) and 100 μg/ml X-Gal (GenDEPOT). After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, blue and white colonies were counted from kanamycin plates (Fig. 1C). The actual TLS frequency was determined from the number of blue colonies out of the total colonies growing on LB/kan plates. Plasmid DNA obtained from blue colonies was analyzed to determine the mutation frequency, and the mutational changes were incorporated during TLS. For details of these methods, see Yoon et al.

DNA substrates consisted of a radiolabeled oligonucleotide primer annealed to a 75-nucleotide (nt) oligonucleotide DNA template by heating a mixture of primer/template at a 1:1.5 molar ratio to 95 °C and allowing it to cool to room temperature for several hours. The template 75-mer oligonucleotide contained the sequence 5′-AGC AAG TCA CCA ATG TCT AAG AGT TCG TAT AAT GCC TAC ACT GGA GTA CCG GAG CAT CGT CGT GAC TGG GAA AAC-3′, and it harbored an undamaged A or a 1-MeA at the underlined position.

Primer extension by human Polθ (1 nm) or yeast Polζ (1 nm) was assayed in the presence of 10 μm each dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP (Roche Applied Science) on DNA containing an A/T or 1-MeA/T primer terminal base pair; the standard DNA polymerase reaction (5 μl) contained 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 10% glycerol, and 10 nm DNA substrate. Reactions containing human Polθ were carried out at 37 °C and yeast Polζ at 30 °C for 10 min. To identify the TLS Pols required for replicating through the 1-MeA lesion, we determined the effects of siRNA depletions of TLS Pols individually and in combinations on TLS frequency opposite this lesion carried on the leading strand template of the SV40-based plasmid. To ascertain that the observed defects result from the deficiency of the particular Pol and not from any off-target effects, we confirmed that the defect in TLS engendered by the siRNA depletion of a Pol was complemented by the respective wild type Pol. TLS in normal human fibroblasts treated with control (NC) siRNA occurred with a frequency of ∼65% (Table 1). In Polη-depleted cells, TLS frequency was reduced to ∼52%. TLS frequency was reduced to ∼45% in Polι-depleted cells, and a similar reduction in TLS frequency was observed in cells depleted for the Rev3 or the Rev7 subunits of Polζ or for Polθ. To determine whether these Pols function independently of one another or whether some of them function together in replicating through the 1-MeA lesion, we examined the effects of simultaneous depletion of two Pols on TLS frequencies. Our observation that simultaneous depletion of Polι and Polθ confers no further reduction in TLS frequency than that seen upon their individual depletion indicates that Pols ι and θ function together in conducting TLS opposite 1-MeA. By contrast, the observation that simultaneous depletion of Polη with Polι or of Polη with Polθ results in a greater reduction in TLS frequency, to ∼30%, than that observed upon their individual depletion implies that Polη functions in TLS opposite 1-MeA independently of Pols ι and θ. And, because the simultaneous depletion of Polη with the Rev3 or Rev7 subunit of Polζ reduces TLS frequency to a greater extent (∼30%) than that observed upon their individual depletion (∼45–52%), Pols η and ζ act independently of one another. Additionally, because the simultaneous depletion of Polι with Polζ confers a greater reduction in TLS frequency than that observed upon their individual depletion, these Pols function in TLS independently of one another.TABLE 1Effects of siRNA knockdowns of TLS polymerases on the replicative bypass of 1-MeA lesion carried on the leading strand template in human fibroblastssiRNANo. of Kan+ coloniesNo. blue colonies among Kan+TLS%NC42327665.2Polη35618752.5Polι42819345.1Rev352422843.5Rev745820544.8Polθ41516339.3Polι + Polθ37216143.3Polη + Polι3029330.8Polη + Polθ40812229.9Polη + Rev335010028.6Polη + Rev72969231.1Polι + Rev32286327.6Polι + Rev72958027.1 Open table in a new tab As deduced from these genetic observations, TLS opposite 1-MeA occurs via three independent pathways mediated by the combined action of Polι and Polθ or by Polη or Polζ, respectively. To provide confirmatory evidence for this deduction, we analyzed the effects of siRNA depletion of TLS Pols on the frequency of TLS opposite 1-MeA in human XPV fibroblasts. Because of the mutational inactivation of the XPV gene, these cells lack Polη, and they exhibit a reduction in TLS frequency similar to that which occurs upon Polη depletion in wild type human fibroblasts (Table 2). TLS in XPV cells occurs with a frequency of ∼47%. Depletion of Polι, Polθ, or Polζ in XPV cells led to a reduction in TLS frequency to ∼30%, confirming that these Pols function independently of Polη (Table 2), and as expected from the involvement of Pols ι and θ in the same TLS pathway, the simultaneous depletion of Polι and Polθ causes no further reduction in TLS frequency than that seen upon their individual depletion. Because only the Polι/Polθ- and Polζ-dependent TLS pathways would remain functional in XPV cells, we expect the simultaneous depletion of Polι and Polζ or of Polθ and Polζ will confer a drastic reduction in TLS frequency. In accord with this, we find that simultaneous depletion of Polι and Rev3 or of Polθ and Rev3 reduces TLS frequency to ∼4–5% (Table 2). These results provide confirmatory evidence that TLS opposite 1-MeA occurs via three independent pathways that require Pols ι and θ in one pathway and Polη and Polζ, respectively, in the other two pathways.TABLE 2Effects of siRNA knockdowns of TLS polymerases on the replicative bypass of 1-MeA lesion carried on the leading strand template in XPV human fibroblastssiRNANo. of Kan+ coloniesNo. blue colonies among Kan+TLS%NC25412047.2Polι2929030.8Polθ2607830.0Rev32247131.7Rev72126028.3Polι + Polθ3128627.6Polι + Rev3238104.2Polθ + Rev3308165.2 Open table in a new tab As determined by sequence analyses of TLS products, TLS opposite the 1-MeA lesion occurs in a predominantly error-free fashion, as in NC siRNA-treated cells only ∼1% of TLS products harbor mutations. Among the ∼400 TLS products that were analyzed, we observed mutations in only four of the TLS products in which an A or G was inserted opposite 1-MeA instead of the correct nucleotide, T (Table 3). Even though the overall TLS-mediated via three different pathways opposite 1-MeA generates only ∼1% mutations, among the TLS Pols involved in 1-MeA bypass some may function in an error-free manner whereas others may promote a more mutagenic mode of TLS. Thus, for example, even though the overall TLS opposite a Tg lesion generates only ∼2% mutations, the Polκ/Polζ-dependent pathway mediates a predominantly error-free mode of TLS, whereas the Polθ-dependent pathway functions in a more error-prone manner (9Yoon J.H. Roy Choudhury J. Park J. Prakash S. Prakash L. A role for DNA polymerase θ in promoting replication through oxidative DNA lesion, thymine glycol, in human cells.J. Biol.

For this reason we examined the frequency and types of mutations generated by the action of different TLS Pols opposite 1-MeA. Interestingly, among the ∼200–300 TLS products analyzed from cells depleted for Polη, Polι, Polθ, or Polζ, we observed mutation frequencies ranging from 0% in Polη-depleted cells to ∼1.5% in Polζ-depleted cells (Table 3). These differences are not statistically significant. We conclude from these results that opposite 1-MeA, all three pathways function in a predominantly error-free manner, generating only ∼1% mutagenic TLS products where an A, or a G, is inserted opposite 1-MeA rather than a T.TABLE 3Effects of siRNA knockdowns of TLS polymerases on the frequencies of nucleotides inserted opposite 1-MeA carried on the leading strand template in human fibroblastssiRNANo. of kan+ blue colonies sequencedaNumbers of mutational TLS events are shown in parentheses.Nucleotide insertedMutation frequencyAGCTNC384 (4)2203801.0Polη308 (0)0003080Polι190 (3)2101871.6Polθ176 (2)2001741.1Rev3288 (4)3102841.4Rev7192 (3)3001891.6a Numbers of mutational TLS events are shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab TLS through a DNA lesion can occur by the action of one Pol, wherein the TLS Pol inserts one nt opposite the DNA lesion and then extends synthesis from the inserted nt (21Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Eukaryotic translesion synthesis DNA polymerases: specificity of structure and function.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Alternatively, TLS through a DNA lesion may occur by the sequential action of two Pols wherein one Pol inserts the nt opposite the lesion and then another Pol extends synthesis (21Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Eukaryotic translesion synthesis DNA polymerases: specificity of structure and function.Annu. Rev.

Eukaryotic polymerases ι and ζ act sequentially to bypass DNA lesions.Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). To determine the potential of TLS Pols for DNA synthesis opposite 1-MeA, we examined their ability to insert dATP, dTTP, dGTP, or dCTP opposite 1-MeA and to synthesize DNA through the 1-MeA lesion in the presence of all 4 dNTPs. As shown in Fig. 2, Polι inserts dTTP opposite undamaged A, and in the presence of all 4 dNTPs, it extends synthesis by incorporating 1–2 additional nts. Opposite 1-MeA, Polι inserts dTTP, but it also inserts a dATP or dCTP, and in the presence of 4 dNTPs, Polι inserts one nt opposite 1-MeA, but it fails to extend synthesis any further. Thus, Polι is more error-prone opposite 1-MeA than opposite an undamaged A, and because of its failure to extend synthesis from the nt opposite 1-MeA, replication through the lesion would require the action of another TLS Pol. The inability of Polι to extend synthesis opposite from 1-MeA and the requirement of Polθ for Polι-dependent TLS indicated from genetic studies suggested that Polθ would extend synthesis from the nt inserted by Polι opposite 1-MeA. Hence, we examined if in the presence of four dNTPs, Polθ could extend synthesis from a T inserted opposite 1-MeA. As shown in Fig. 3, Polθ exhibits the same propensity for extending synthesis from the T nt opposite 1-MeA as from opposite undamaged A. These biochemical observations support the inference that in the Polι/Polθ pathway, TLS through the 1-MeA lesion would occur by the sequential action of Polι and Polθ, wherein after nt insertion by Polι opposite 1-MeA, Polθ performs the subsequent extension step of TLS.FIGURE 3Primer extension from a T annealed to an A or a 1-MeA template by Polθ and Polζ. The DNA substrate is shown above the gel where the asterisk indicates the site of either an undamaged A or a 1-MeA residue on a 75-mer template. DNA synthesis by human Polθ (1 nm) was assayed at 37 °C, and DNA synthesis by yeast Polζ (1 nm) was assayed at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of 10 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP and dCTP on DNA containing an A/T (lane 2) or 1-MeA/T (lane 3) primer terminal base pair; lane 1 contains DNA substrate with no enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Biochemical studies show that opposite 1-MeA, Polη incorporated dTTP better than the incorrect nts, and the pattern of correct and incorrect nt incorporation opposite 1-MeA resembled that opposite undamaged A (Fig. 4). Thus, in addition to dTTP, Polη inserted the other three nts dATP, dGTP, or dCTP almost equally well opposite 1-MeA and undamaged A. In the presence of four dNTPs, Polη synthesized full-length products on 1-MeA containing DNA, but its ability to extend synthesis from the nt inserted opposite 1-MeA was reduced, as indicated by the presence of a prominent stall site opposite 1-MeA but not opposite undamaged A. Polζ is very inefficient in inserting nts opposite DNA lesions but it is highly proficient at extending synthesis from nts opposite from a diverse array of DNA lesions (21Prakash S. Johnson R.E.

To verify that Polζ plays a similar role opposite 1-MeA, we examined the proficiency of Polζ for extending from the 1-MeA:T base pair. As shown in Fig. 3, in the presence of 4 dNTPs, Polζ extends synthesis from the 1-MeA:T base pair as well as from the undamaged A:T base pair. The important findings of this study are as follows. 1) TLS provides a major means for replication of 1-MeA containing DNA. 2) Multiple pathways promote replication through the 1-MeA lesion. 3) TLS opposite 1-MeA occurs in a predominantly error-free manner. We consider the implications of these observations for the prominent role of TLS in the replication of 1-MeA-damaged DNA, for the roles of TLS Pols in 1-MeA bypass as related to their structural and biochemical features, and for the fact that in human cells, TLS opposite 1-MeA occurs in a highly error-free fashion. Previously, we have determined the extent, genetic control, and mutagenicity of TLS opposite three DNA lesions, cis-syn TT dimer, (6-4) TT photoproduct, and thymine glycol. These studies indicated that in nucleotide excision repair-defective XPA human fibroblasts, TLS opposite a cis-syn TT dimer or a (6-4) TT photoproduct occurs with a frequency of ∼40%, whereas TLS opposite these lesions in nucleotide excision repair-proficient fibroblasts occurs with a frequency of ∼20%. Thus, a very substantial fraction of these UV photoproducts are excised from plasmid DNA before its replication. Similar to that for UV photoproducts, in wild type fibroblasts, TLS opposite the thymine glycol lesion occurs with a frequency of ∼20–25%. In striking contrast to the TLS frequency of ∼20–25% opposite UV photoproducts or thymine glycol in wild type fibroblasts, we find that opposite 1-MeA, TLS contributes to ∼65% of lesion bypass. Because the 1-MeA lesion carried on the duplex plasmid will be subject to removal by base excision repair or nucleotide excision repair, we presume that TLS provides a predominant, if not the sole means for replicating through this lesion. From siRNA depletion of TLS Pols, we have inferred that replication through the 1-MeA lesion occurs via three different pathways that, respectively, require Polι/Polθ, Polη, or Polζ (Fig. 5). Because biochemical studies have indicated that Polι can insert a nt opposite 1-MeA but lacks the ability to extend synthesis from the inserted nt whereas Polθ can carry out efficient extension of synthesis from the nt opposite 1-MeA, we suggest that Polι/Polθ-dependent TLS would occur by the sequential action of Polι and Polθ at the insertion and extension step of TLS, respectively (Fig. 5). In the Polη-dependent pathway, Polη alone would carry out both the insertion and extension steps of TLS, and because of the proficient ability of Polζ to extend synthesis from the nt opposite 1-MeA, we expect that in the Polζ-dependent TLS pathway, an as yet unidentified TLS Pol would insert a nt opposite 1-MeA from which Polζ would extend (Fig. 5). We are now checking whether any of the Pols not yet examined for their role in TLS opposite 1-MeA, such as Polκ, Polν, or Polλ, could function as an inserter in this pathway. In the Polι/Polθ-dependent pathway, the ability of Polι to push 1-MeA into a syn conformation and to form a Hoogsteen base pair with the incoming T residue would allow it to carry out an nt insertion opposite 1-MeA from which Polθ would extend (26Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Hoogsteen base pair formation promotes synthesis opposite the 1, N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine lesion by human DNA polymerase ι.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Replication by human DNA polymerase ι occurs via Hoogsteen base-pairing.Nature. 2004; 430: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that Polθ can replicate through the Tg lesion by both inserting an A opposite Tg and then by extending from there (9Yoon J.H. Roy Choudhury J. Park J. Prakash S. Prakash L. A role for DNA polymerase θ in promoting replication through oxidative DNA lesion, thymine glycol, in human cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 13177-13185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The ability of Polθ to extend synthesis on DNA containing a Tg lesion that blocks the base 5′ to Tg from stacking above it, and the potential ability of Polθ to extend from the 1-MeA:T Hoogsteen base pair handed over to it by Polι would suggest that Polθ, an A-family Pol, can extend synthesis opposite from a diverse array of DNA lesions which distort the DNA helix or which inhibit the W-C base pairing. Our genetic and biochemical observations support a role for Polη in replicating through the 1-MeA lesion by inserting a nt opposite 1-MeA and then by extending synthesis. Such a role for Polη is intriguing in view of the fact that biochemical studies have indicated that Polη uses W-C base pairing for DNA synthesis. For example, synthesis by Polη is severely impaired by a difluorotoluene base, which is virtually identical in shape, size, and conformation to thymine but lacks the ability to form W-C hydrogen bonds with adenine (28Washington M.T. Helquist S.A. Kool E.T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Requirement of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding for DNA synthesis by yeast DNA polymerase η.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5107-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). And opposite the UV-induced cis-syn TT dimer, Polη forms W-C base pairs with an A opposite both the 3′-T and 5′-T residues of the dimer (29Biertümpfel C. Zhao Y. Kondo Y. Ramón-Maiques S. Gregory M.

Prakash L. Prakash S. Distinct mechanisms of cis-syn thymine dimer bypass by Dpo4 and DNA polymerase η.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Structural basis for the suppression of skin cancers by DNA polymerase η.Nature. 2010; 465: 1039-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Curiously, although biochemical studies with yeast Polη have indicated that the incorporation of 1-MeA opposite the 3′T or the 5′T of a TT dimer or opposite the undamaged T residue is reduced by ∼100–200-fold compared with the incorporation of an A opposite the undamaged or UV-damaged T residue (30Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Distinct mechanisms of cis-syn thymine dimer bypass by Dpo4 and DNA polymerase η.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12359-12364Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), human Polη inserts a T opposite 1-MeA almost as well as it inserts a T opposite undamaged A. It remains to be seen how in the absence of W-C base pairing, Polη can manage to insert the correct T nt opposite 1-MeA and then extend synthesis from the 1-MeA:T base pair. In the Polζ-dependent pathway, the proficient ability of Polζ to extend synthesis from the 1-MeA:T base pair is in accord with the role of this Pol in extending synthesis opposite from a wide variety of DNA lesions that distort the DNA helix or which impair W-C base pairing. It may turn out that the TLS Pol found to be involved in inserting the nt opposite 1-MeA requires W-C hydrogen bonding for synthesizing DNA. The ability of TLS Pols such as Polη and others to bypass the requirement of W-C base-pairing opposite 1-MeA and presumably opposite other such lesions would suggest that at these lesion sites, TLS Pols can stabilize the nascent base pair in their active site by using means other than W-C hydrogen bonding. Rather surprisingly, in human cells, despite the poor fidelity of Pols η and ι for nt insertion opposite 1-MeA, TLS opposite this lesion occurs with a high fidelity, and only ∼1% of TLS products harbor mutations. The high fidelity with which TLS Pols manage to replicate 1-MeA damaged DNA recapitulates the relatively high fidelity TLS that occurs opposite the cis-syn TT dimer, (6-4) TT photoproduct, and thymine glycol, where despite the low fidelity of DNA synthesis by the TLS Pols involved in their replicative bypass, only ∼2% of TLS products harbor mutations (10Yoon J.-H. Bhatia G. Prakash S. Prakash L. Error-free replicative bypass of thymine glycol by the combined action of DNA polymerases κ and ζ in human cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, opposite these different types of DNA lesions, which confer structural distortions or affect W-C base pairing, human cells have adapted TLS Pols to function in a much more error-free manner than would be predicted from their fidelity for nt incorporation. It remains enigmatic how human cells manage to achieve such a high fidelity for replicating through DNA lesions. A likely possibility is that protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications regulate the fidelity of TLS Pols in human cells. J. C., J.-H. Y., and J. R.

Vertebrate Opn3/TMT opsins are further classified into four groups on the basis of their amino acid identities. However, there is limited information about molecular properties of these groups, due to the difficulty in preparing the recombinant proteins. Here, we successfully expressed recombinant proteins of TMT1 and TMT2 opsins of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) in cultured cells and characterized their molecular properties. Spectroscopic and biochemical studies demonstrated that TMT1 and TMT2 opsins functioned as blue light-sensitive Gi/Go-coupled receptors, but exhibited spectral properties and photo-convertibility of the active state different from each other. TMT1 opsin forms a visible light-absorbing active state containing all-trans-retinal, which can be photo-converted to 7-cis- and 9-cis-retinal states in addition to the original 11-cis-retinal state. In contrast, the active state of TMT2 opsin is a UV light-absorbing state having all-trans-retinal and does not photo-convert to any other state, including the original 11-cis-retinal state. Thus, TMT opsins are diversified so as to form a different type of active state, which may be responsible for their different functions."

However, side effects associated with medication or studying psychiatric groups may confound the relationship between dopamine and cognitive control. To circumvent such possibilities, we utilized a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design wherein participants were administered a nutritionally-balanced amino acid mixture (BAL) and an amino acid mixture deficient in the dopamine precursors tyrosine (TYR) and phenylalanine (PHE) on two separate occasions. Order of sessions was randomly assigned. Cognitive control and performance monitoring were assessed using response times (RT), error rates, the N450, an event-related potential (ERP) index of conflict monitoring, the conflict slow potential (conflict SP), an ERP index of conflict resolution, and the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe), ERPs associated with performance monitoring. Participants were twelve males who completed a Stroop color-word task while ERPs were collected four hours following acute PHE and TYR depletion (APTD) or balanced (BAL) mixture ingestion in two separate sessions. N450 and conflict SP ERP amplitudes significantly differentiated congruent from incongruent trials, but did not differ as a function of APTD or BAL mixture ingestion. Similarly, ERN and Pe amplitudes showed significant differences between error and correct trials that were not different between APTD and BAL conditions. Findings indicate that acute dopamine precursor depletion does not significantly alter cognitive control and performance monitoring ERPs. Current results do not preclude the role of dopamine in these processes, but suggest that multiple methods for dopamine-related hypothesis testing are needed."

HDACi prominently up-regulated expression of the Nherf1 scaffold protein, which played a major role in preventing osteoblast-mediated protection of AML cells. Protein phosphatase-1α (PP1α) was identified as a novel Nherf1 interacting protein that acts as the downstream mediator of this response by promoting nuclear localization of the TAZ transcriptional modulator. Moreover, independent activation of either PP1α or TAZ was sufficient to prevent osteoblast-mediated protection of AML cells even in the absence of HDACi. Together, these results indicate that HDACi target the AML microenvironment by enhancing activation of the Nherf1-PP1α-TAZ pathway in osteoblasts. Selective drug targeting of this osteoblast signaling pathway may improve treatments of AML by rendering leukemic cells in the bone marrow more susceptible to apoptosis. Disrupting the protective signals provided by the bone marrow microenvironment will be critical for more effective combination drug therapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cells of the osteoblast lineage that reside in the endosteal niche have been implicated in promoting survival of AML cells. Here, we investigated how to prevent this protective interaction. We previously showed that SDF-1, a chemokine abundant in the bone marrow, induces apoptosis of AML cells, unless the leukemic cells receive protective signals provided by differentiating osteoblasts (8Kremer K.N.

Even though complete remission rates have improved, relapse remains a problem in the majority of patients with this disease.

Because AML cells thrive in the bone marrow, this apparent contradiction indicated that a cell type within the bone marrow must provide signals that protect AML cells from SDF-1-induced apoptosis. Utilizing co-culture systems, we previously demonstrated that co-culturing differentiating osteoblasts, but not earlier precursors of the osteoblast lineage, with the AML cells completely abrogated SDF-1-induced apoptosis of the AML cells (8Kremer K.N.

These results prompted us to utilize this co-culture system to identify strategies to inhibit osteoblast-mediated protection of AML cells. HDACi are being explored as treatments for diverse malignancies.

HDACi have been previously shown to up-regulate Nherf1 (also known as EBP-50), a scaffold protein mutated in human hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis type 2. Nherf1 has been linked with TAZ, a ubiquitously expressed transcriptional modulator, in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation (19Xing W. Kim J. Wergedal J. Chen S.T. Mohan S. Ephrin B1 regulates bone marrow stromal cell differentiation and bone formation by influencing TAZ transactivation via complex formation with NHERF1.Mol.

Localization of TAZ to the nucleus, where it increases expression of multiple genes including those controlled by the TEAD and SMAD family of transcription factors, is regulated by phosphorylation. When TAZ is phosphorylated, it is localized to the cytoplasm. Dephosphorylation by PP1α, a ubiquitously expressed Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, induces TAZ nuclear localization to mediate osteoblast differentiation (20Byun M.R. Hwang J.H. Kim A.R. Kim K.M.

Here, we show that HDACi inhibit the protective functions of the bone marrow microenvironment in AML by targeting osteoblasts to increase expression of Nherf1, and that Nherf1 up-regulation prevented osteoblast-mediated protection of AML cells in co-cultures. We also show that increased Nherf1 activates a novel signaling pathway in osteoblasts by binding PP1α, which promotes TAZ nuclear localization and inhibits the ability of osteoblasts to protect AML cells from apoptosis while having little effect on osteoblast differentiation. Together, these results identify several members of a novel molecular signaling pathway within osteoblasts that could be targeted in AML to ameliorate the leukemic cell protective effects of the endosteal niche.

https://openalex.org/W2255386136,"Eukaryotic structural maintenance of chromosome proteins (SMC) are major components of cohesin and condensins that regulate chromosome structure and dynamics during cell cycle. We here determine the crystal structure of human condensin SMC hinge heterodimer with ~30 residues of coiled coils. The structure, in conjunction with the hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry analyses, revealed the structural basis for the specific heterodimer formation of eukaryotic SMC and that the coiled coils from two different hinges protrude in the same direction, providing a unique binding surface conducive for binding to single-stranded DNA. The characteristic hydrogen exchange profiles of peptides constituted regions especially across the hinge-hinge dimerization interface, further suggesting the structural alterations upon single-stranded DNA binding and the presence of a half-opened state of hinge heterodimer. This structural change potentially relates to the DNA loading mechanism of SMC, in which the hinge domain functions as an entrance gate as previously proposed for cohesin. Our results, however, indicated that this is not the case for condensins based on the fact that the coiled coils are still interacting with each other, even when DNA binding induces structural changes in the hinge region, suggesting the functional differences of SMC hinge domain between condensins and cohesin in DNA recognition."

The enzyme RNase H2 plays a critical role in targeting the removal of these ribonucleotides from DNA, and defects in RNase H2 activity are associated with both genomic instability and the human autoimmune/inflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Whether additional general DNA repair mechanisms contribute to ribonucleotide removal from DNA in human cells is not known. Because of its ability to act on a wide variety of substrates, we examined a potential role for canonical nucleotide excision repair in the removal of ribonucleotides from DNA. However, using highly sensitive dual incision/excision assays, we find that ribonucleotides are not efficiently targeted by the human nucleotide excision repair system in vitro or in cultured human cells.

https://openalex.org/W2146463209,"A combination of fisheries dependent and independent data was used to assess the vulnerability of the oceanic whitetip shark to pelagic longline fisheries. The Brazilian tuna longline fleet, operating in the equatorial and southwestern Atlantic, is used as a case study. Fisheries dependent data include information from logbooks (from 1999 to 2011) and on-board observers (2004 to 2010), totaling 65,277 pelagic longline sets. Fisheries independent data were obtained from 8 oceanic whitetip sharks tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags in the area where longline fleet operated. Deployment periods varied from 60 to 178 days between 2010 and 2012. Tagging and pop-up sites were relatively close to each other, although individuals tended to travel long distances before returning to the tagging area. Some degree of site fidelity was observed. High utilization hotspots of tagged sharks fell inside the area under strongest fishing pressure. Despite the small sample size, a positive correlation between tag recorded information and catch data was detected. All sharks exhibited a strong preference for the warm and shallow waters of the mixed layer, spending on average more than 70% of the time above the thermocline and 95% above 120 m. Results indicate that the removal of shallow hooks on longline gear might be an efficient mitigation measure to reduce the bycatch of this pelagic shark species. The work also highlights the potential of tagging experiments to provide essential information for the development of spatio-temporal management measures."
https://openalex.org/W1909480047,"Although Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 is one of the most proficient cellulose degrading bacteria among all mesophilic organisms in the rumen of herbivores, the molecular mechanism behind cellulose degradation by this bacterium is not fully elucidated. Previous studies have indicated that cell surface proteins might play a role in adhesion to and subsequent degradation of cellulose in this bacterium. It has also been suggested that cellulose degradation machinery on the surface may be selectively expressed in response to the presence of cellulose. Based on the genome sequence, several models of cellulose degradation have been suggested. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of the cell envelope proteins in adhesion to cellulose and to gain a better understanding of the subsequent cellulose degradation mechanism in this bacterium. Comparative analysis of the surface (exposed outer membrane) chemistry of the cells grown in glucose, acid-swollen cellulose and microcrystalline cellulose using physico-chemical characterisation techniques such as electrophoretic mobility analysis, microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons assay and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, suggest that adhesion to cellulose is a consequence of an increase in protein display and a concomitant reduction in the cell surface polysaccharides in the presence of cellulose. In order to gain further understanding of the molecular mechanism of cellulose degradation in this bacterium, the cell envelope-associated proteins were enriched using affinity purification and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 185 cell envelope-associated proteins were confidently identified. Of these, 25 proteins are predicted to be involved in cellulose adhesion and degradation, and 43 proteins are involved in solute transport and energy generation. Our results supports the model that cellulose degradation in F. succinogenes occurs at the outer membrane with active transport of cellodextrins across for further metabolism of cellodextrins to glucose in the periplasmic space and inner cytoplasmic membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2101451339,"Background This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between cigarette smoking and coronary atherosclerotic burden, volume and composition as determined in-vivo by grayscale and virtual histology (VH) intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Methods and Results Between 2008 and 2011, (VH-)IVUS of a non-culprit coronary artery was performed in 581 patients undergoing coronary angiography. To account for differences in baseline characteristics, current smokers were matched to never smokers by age, gender and indication for catheterization, resulting in 280 patients available for further analysis. Coronary atherosclerotic plaque volume, burden, composition (fibrous, fibro-fatty, dense calcium and necrotic core) and high-risk lesions (VH-IVUS derived thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA), plaque burden ≥70%, minimal luminal area ≤4.0 mm2) were assessed. Cigarette smoking showed a tendency towards higher coronary plaque burden (mean±SD, 38.6±12.5% in current versus 36.4±11.0% in never smokers, p = 0.080; and odds ratio (OR) of current smoking for plaque burden above versus below the median 1.69 (1.04–2.75), p = 0.033). This effect was driven by an association in patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (current smokers, plaque burden 38.3±12.8% versus never smokers, plaque burden 35.0±11.2%, p = 0.049; OR 1.88 (1.02–3.44), p = 0.042). Fibrous tissue tended to be lower in current smokers (mean±SD, 57.7±10.5% versus 60.4±12.6%, p = 0.050) and fibro-fatty tissue was higher in current smokers (median[IQR], 9.6[6.0–13.7]% versus 8.6[5.8–12.2]%, p = 0.039). However, differences in percentage necrotic core and dense calcium could not be demonstrated. Also, no differences were found with regard to high-risk lesions. Conclusions An association between smoking and degree of coronary atherosclerosis was present in patients undergoing coronary angiography who presented with ACS. Although smoking was associated with higher fibro-fatty percentage, no associations could be demonstrated with percentage necrotic core, nor with VH-IVUS derived TCFA lesions. Since the magnitude of the differences in both degree and composition of atherosclerosis was modest, clinical relevance of the findings may be questioned."
https://openalex.org/W2108959949,"G9a is a lysine methyltransferase (KMTase) for histone H3 lysine 9 that plays critical roles in a number of biological processes. Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant expression of G9a contributes to tumor metastasis and maintenance of a malignant phenotype in cancer by inducing epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Here, we show that G9a regulates Sox2 protein stability in breast cancer cells. When G9a lysine methyltransferase activity was chemically inhibited in the ER(+) breast cancer cell line MCF7, Sox2 protein levels were decreased. In addition, ectopic overexpression of G9a induced accumulation of Sox2. Changes in cell migration, invasion, and mammosphere formation by MCF7 cells were correlated with the activity or expression level of G9a. Ectopic expression of G9a also increased Sox2 protein levels in another ER(+) breast cancer cell line, ZR-75-1, whereas it did not affect Sox2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, an ER(-) breast cancer cell line, or in glioblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, treatment of mouse embryonic stem cells with a KMT inhibitor, BIX-01294, resulted in a rapid reduction in Sox2 protein expression despite increased Sox2 transcript levels. This finding suggests that G9a has a novel function in the regulation of Sox2 protein stability in a cell type-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2112436405,"Immunotherapy treatments for cancer are becoming increasingly successful, however to further improve our understanding of the T-cell recognition involved in effective responses and to encourage moves towards the development of personalised treatments for leukaemia immunotherapy, precise antigenic targets in individual patients have been identified. Cellular arrays using peptide-MHC (pMHC) tetramers allow the simultaneous detection of different antigen specific T-cell populations naturally circulating in patients and normal donors. We have developed the pMHC array to detect CD8+ T-cell populations in leukaemia patients that recognise epitopes within viral antigens (cytomegalovirus (CMV) and influenza (Flu)) and leukaemia antigens (including Per Arnt Sim domain 1 (PASD1), MelanA, Wilms’ Tumour (WT1) and tyrosinase). We show that the pMHC array is at least as sensitive as flow cytometry and has the potential to rapidly identify more than 40 specific T-cell populations in a small sample of T-cells (0.8–1.4 x 106). Fourteen of the twenty-six acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients analysed had T cells that recognised tumour antigen epitopes, and eight of these recognised PASD1 epitopes. Other tumour epitopes recognised were MelanA (n = 3), tyrosinase (n = 3) and WT1126-134 (n = 1). One of the seven acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) patients analysed had T cells that recognised the MUC1950-958 epitope.

However, the link between impaired physical function, OA and falls have not been elucidated.

This study included 389 participants [229 fallers (≥2 falls or one injurious fall in the past 12 months), 160 non-fallers (no history of falls)], age (≥65 years) from a randomized controlled trial, the Malaysian Falls Assessment and Intervention Trial (MyFAIT). Physical function was assessed using Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Functional Reach (FR) tests. Knee and hip OA were diagnosed using three methods: Clinical, Radiological and Self-report. OA symptom severity was assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). The total WOMAC score was categorized to asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe symptoms. Individuals with radiological OA and ‘mild’ overall symptoms on the WOMAC score had reduced risk of falls compared to asymptomatic OA [OR: 0.402(0.172–0.940), p = 0.042]. Individuals with clinical OA and ‘severe’ overall symptoms had increased risk of falls compared to those with ‘mild’ OA [OR: 4.487(1.883–10.693), p = 0.005]. In individuals with radiological OA, mild symptoms appear protective of falls while those with clinical OA and severe symptoms have increased falls risk compared to those with mild symptoms. Both relationships between OA and falls were not mediated by physical limitations. Larger prospective studies are needed for further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2115970840,"In response to an extreme event, individuals on social media demonstrate interesting behaviors depending on their backgrounds. By making use of the large-scale datasets of posts and search queries collected from Twitter and GoogleTrends, we first identify the distinct categories of human collective online concerns and durations based on the distributions of solo tweets and new incremental tweets about events. Such a characterization enables us to gain a better understanding of dynamic changes in human behaviors corresponding to different types of events. Next, we observe the heterogeneity of individual responses to events through measuring the fraction of event-related tweets relative to the tweets released by an individual, and thus empirically confirm the heterogeneity assumption as adopted in the meta-population models for characterizing collective responses to events. Finally, based on the correlations of information entropy in different regions, we show that the observed distinct responses may be caused by their different speeds in information propagation. In addition, based on the detrended fluctuation analysis, we find that there exists a self-similar evolution process for the collective responses within a region. These findings have provided a detailed account for the nature of distinct human behaviors on social media in presence of extreme events."

In this study we aimed to gain insight into mouse trophoblast genomic identity and lineage specification by identifying genes specific to the TSC compartment. To this end we performed global gene expression profiling on four different cell types: mouse TSCs, mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). By comparing differentially expressed genes in these cell lines, we identified a list of genes that are specific to TSCs, including some previously identified such as Cdx2 and Tead4; we hypothesized that these genes may function to maintain TSCs in an uncommitted state and/or initiate their differentiation process. We further explored the function of one gene in particular, Sox21, in TSC self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. Sox21 belongs to the SoxB2 group of the Sry-related HMG box (SOX) gene family and, based on the analysis of its structural protein domains, has been reported to be a transcriptional repressor (13Uchikawa M. Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Two distinct subgroups of Group B Sox genes for transcriptional activators and repressors: their expression during embryonic organogenesis of the chicken.Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Sox21 has been mostly characterized in the context of neuronal differentiation. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a restricted expression of Sox21 in neurogenic regions of both embryonic and adult mouse brain (14Tada H. Ishii S. Kimura H. Hattori H. Okada Y. Suzuki N. James Okano H. Identification and evaluation of high-titer anti-Sox Group B antibody in limbic encephalitis.Inflamm. Regen. 2007; 27: 37-44Crossref Google Scholar). Consistently, ectopic expression of Sox21 induced neural progenitor cells to leave the cell cycle and up-regulate neuronal markers, suggesting a critical role for Sox21 in the regulation of neurogenesis (15Sandberg M. Källström M. Muhr J. Sox21 promotes the progression of vertebrate neurogenesis.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of Sox21 in ES cells appears to trigger differentiation of these cells toward a mesoderm and neuroectoderm phenotype (16Mallanna S.K. Ormsbee B.D. Iacovino M. Gilmore J.M.

It is worth noting that in the same study, Sox21 was capable of inducing the expression of two trophectoderm markers, Esx1 and Cdh3. However, the expression and function of Sox21 in extraembryonic tissues, including TSCs, is to date unknown. Our results show that Sox21 is highly expressed in undifferentiated TSCs compared with both embryonic and epiblast stem cells and regulates initiation of differentiation specifically toward the spongiotrophoblast/giant cell lineage. These findings implicate Sox21 as a novel player in trophoblast differentiation and placental development. All mouse cell lines used in this study were derived from mice with the same genetic background (129S1/SvImJ). TSCs were derived form E3.5 blastocysts according to a previous published protocol (17Tanaka S. Derivation and culture of mouse trophoblast stem cells in vitro.Methods Mol.

ESCs were a generous gift of Predictive Biology Inc. (Carlsbad, CA). RNA samples used for microarray analysis were prepared using the TotalPrep kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression profiling was performed using MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChips according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Each hybridization experiment was performed on a total of five replicates, and the data were normalized after background subtraction. Global expression profile data were analyzed using Qlucore Omics Explorer (Lund, Sweden). The list of probes for cluster analysis was created in Qlucore comparing each sample group against the others. Statistically significant genes were selected with a variance of 0.01, two-group analysis with q < 0.05, and a -fold change ≥2.0.

Biol. 2006; 329: 35-44PubMed Google Scholar). TS cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Corning/Cellgro) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 55 nm β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), 25 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4; Sigma), and 1 μg/ml heparin (Sigma) with 70% of medium being conditioned for 72 h on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts. For differentiation conditions, TS cell medium was used as described above without supplementation with FGF4, heparin, and conditioned medium. TS cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. In brief, TS cells were grown to 80% confluence in 6-well plates and then incubated with the Lipofectamine/DNA complexes overnight. The next day cells were washed with PBS, and new medium was added. After 48 h, cells were treated with the appropriate antibiotic to allow selection of transfected cells. After 2 weeks, the remaining cells were replated and cultured for 2 passages before being frozen for long term storage or used for experiments. For the generation of the Sox21 shRNA stable cell lines, three different constructs were initially tested, but only one showed an efficient knockdown of the Sox21 mRNA. All the experiments were performed using at least two different stable cell lines carrying the same shRNA construct. Placental tissues were collected under a protocol approved by the Human Research Protections Program Committee of the University of California San Diego Institutional Review Board. All patients gave informed consent for collection and use of these tissues. First-trimester cytotrophoblasts were isolated from elective terminations between 6 and 12 weeks gestational age as previously described (22Li Y. Moretto-Zita M. Leon-Garcia S. Parast M.M. p63 inhibits extravillous trophoblast migration and maintains cells in a cytotrophoblast stem cell-like state.Am. J. Pathol. 2014; 184: 3332-3343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cytotrophoblasts were seeded at a density of 300,000 cells/cm2 in 6-well plates coated with 20 μg/ml fibronectin. Cells were cultured in trophoblast medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.2% gentamicin, and 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol with media changed every other day. Under an approved animal protocol, timed matings were performed with CD-1 mice, and E6.5, E7.5, and E8.5 implantation sites and E10.5 placentas were harvested and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS. The samples were then processed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to identify the optimal sections for in situ hybridization. In situ hybridization was performed on a Ventana automated stainer using a mouse Sox21-specific probe and a negative control probe, both from ACD-Bio. Total RNA from TSC cultures was isolated using the NucleoSpin® RNA kit (Clontech). 1.0 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit in a 20-μl reaction. The cDNA was diluted 10 times in nuclease-free water and 2 μl of the diluted cDNA along with 625 nm concentrations of each primer and POWER SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) were used for the PCR reaction. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) reactions were performed in triplicate for each sample using an Eco Real-time PCR System (Illumina) and a one-step program: 95 °C for 10 min; 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. A melting curve analysis was arranged for determination of PCR product specificity. For each reaction a cycle threshold (Ct) value was recorded. The mean Ct value of triplicate reactions was used to determine the relative gene expression normalized against Gapdh using the comparative Ct (ΔΔCt) method (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2(−ΔΔCt) method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123298) Google Scholar).

The protein content was determined with the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). A total of 30 μg of total protein was separated on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma) followed by incubation with the primary antibody. Primary antibodies included goat anti-Sox21 (AF3538, R&D systems), Gcm1 (P100836_P050, Aviva System Biology), and mouse anti-β-actin (A5441, Sigma). TS cells were plated on glass coverslips, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. Mouse anti-HA tag antibody (ab18181, Abcam), goat anti-Sox21 (AF3538, R&D systems), and Alexa dye-conjugated phalloidin and Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used per the manufacturer's instructions. Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting media containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Trophoblast giant cells were identified as cells with large, sometimes bilobed nuclei at least twice the size (judged as estimated cross-sectional area) of undifferentiated TS cell nuclei. For invasion assays, Transwell chambers with 6.5-mm-diameter polycarbonate filters of 8-μm pore size (Costar) were placed into wells of a 24-well plate. Each filter was coated with 100 μl of a 1:20 dilution of cold Matrigel (BD Bioscience) in RPMI 1640 medium and let to solidify at 37 °C for 2 h. Trophoblast stem cells were differentiated for 7 days in TS media; on day 7, cells were trypsinized, and 105 cells were plated onto the Matrigel-coated filter. The medium in the lower chamber was changed every day. After 3 days, the Transwell inserts were fixed for 15 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and washed with PBS. Cells that remained at the upper surface of the filters were scraped off, and filters were stained with DAPI and phalloidin. The remaining cells (migrated to the bottom of the filter) were imaged and counted using a fluorescence microscope (Leica). Proliferation assays were performed by plating 25 × 104 cells/well in TS cell medium on a 6-well plate. Cells were collected and counted using an automated cell counter (Bio-Rad) at days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, replacing the medium every other day. To assay apoptosis, an annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences, catalog #556547) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Unless otherwise stated data presented are the mean ± S.D. of three biological replicates. Student's t test was performed, and p values below 0.05 were taken to indicate a statistically significant difference between the populations sampled. Global expression profiles were obtained from mouse TSCs, ESCs, ESC-derived EpiSCs, and MEFs. Principal component analysis showed clustering of TSC replicates, distinctly separated from ESCs, EpiSCs, and MEFs (Fig. 1A). The heatmap in Fig. 1B shows genes with statistically significant differences in expression among the different cell types. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a cluster of genes specifically up-regulated in TSC, including many previously characterized TSC-specific genes such as Cdx2, Eomes, and Tead4, thus confirming the accuracy of the microarray data (Fig. 1C; for a comprehensive list of TSC-specific genes, see supplemental Table 1). Gene Ontology analysis of the TSC-specific cluster revealed a total of 85 biological process categories that were significantly overrepresented, including regulation of transcription, embryonic, and placenta development, regulation of cell proliferation, apoptotic process, and intracellular signaling cascade. The top 13 TSC-associated biological process categories are shown in Fig. 1D. We then turned our attention to novel and uncharacterized genes with a >2-fold expression difference when comparing TSCs with all other cell types. Among these genes was Sox21, a member of the Sox family of transcription factors, with an unknown role in the context of TSCs. To validate the data from the microarray analysis, we analyzed the expression of Sox21 in TSC, ESC, EpiSC, and MEFs by qRT-PCR and Western blot (Fig. 1, E and F, respectively). qRT-PCR experiments showed that Sox21 expression was two and five times higher in TSCs compared with ESCs and EpiSCs, respectively. Sox21 mRNA levels in MEFs were low or undetectable. qRT-PCR data were, subsequently, confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting. Interestingly, microarray data analysis showed that Sox21 was the only member of the family uniquely expressed in TSC, although Sox5, -8, and -13 were also expressed in TSC (data not shown). To examine the expression of Sox21 in vivo, we performed in situ hybridization of mouse embryos and placentas at different stages of development. At E6.5, Sox21 was mainly detected in a subset of cells in the extraembryonic ectoderm (Fig. 2A). At E7.5, Sox21 RNA was highly expressed in the chorion but undetected in the ectoplacental cone (Fig. 2, B and C). At E8.5, Sox21 was detected in some cells in the ectoplacental cone and the TGC layer (Fig. 2D). In the E10.5 placenta, Sox21 expression was significantly reduced and was detected only in rare TGCs (Fig. 2E). To determine the subcellular localization of Sox21 in TSCs, we first employed immunocytochemistry using a Sox21-specific antibody. Sox21 was detected in the nuclei of undifferentiated cells, and the staining was strongly reduced in cells with a morphologically differentiated phenotype (Fig. 3A). We next investigated Sox21 RNA expression pattern by qRT-PCR in TSCs upon withdrawal of FGF4 and heparin (FGF4-H) and conditioned medium (CM) to induce differentiation. Under these conditions, TSCs decrease expression of known stem cell markers Cdx2 and Esrrb (Fig. 3B, black and dark gray bars, respectively); the reduction in Sox21 mRNA was more gradual until day 7 when it was undetectable (Fig. 3B, light gray bar). To confirm the qRT-PCR data, we performed Western blot analysis on whole cell lysates showing that Sox21 protein expression was significantly reduced by day 4 after removal of FGF4-H and CM and completely lost by day 7 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, immunocytochemistry of TSCs confirmed the reduction of Sox21 nuclear signal during differentiation, showing only a residual signal at day 5 and complete loss of expression by day 7 (Fig. 3D). Finally, we evaluated the expression of SOX21 in primary human trophoblast. We performed qRT-PCR on human cytotrophoblast cells isolated from first trimester placentas (Fig. 3E). SOX21 RNA levels were high in freshly isolated, undifferentiated cells and decreased significantly after 4 days of in vitro differentiation. These data clearly show that in both mouse and human, Sox21 expression is highest in undifferentiated trophoblast and decreases with differentiation. We set out to knockdown Sox21 in TSCs to determine the effect(s) on differentiation. To this end we generated stable cell lines expressing lentiviral Sox21-specific shRNAs and a scramble shRNA as a control. After transfection and selection with puromycin, we analyzed expression levels of Sox21 by qRT-PCR. shRNA designed to knockdown Sox21 mRNA resulted in a significant decrease in Sox21 mRNA, down to 50% compared with control (see Fig. 4D at day 0). Under growth conditions Sox21 knockdown (Sox21-KD) cells had a similar morphology to scramble control cells (Fig. 4A, right and left panels, respectively). The knockdown level of Sox21 was evaluated at the protein level by Western blot during differentiation, showing a decrease in Sox21-KD cells compared with control (Fig. 4B). We then analyzed the RNA expression of the stem cell markers, Cdx2, Esrrb, and Eomes, comparing Sox21-KD and control cells. Cdx2 and Esrrb showed similar levels expression, whereas under the same conditions, Eomes was significantly down-regulated (Fig. 4C). Sox21-KD and control cells also showed no difference in proliferation or apoptosis (data not shown). Upon differentiation, Sox21-KD cells down-regulated Sox21 RNA levels more significantly than the scramble control cells (Fig. 4D). By contrast, expression of TGC markers placental lactogen-1 (Prl3d1), placental lactogen-2 (Prl3b1), and proliferin (Prl2c2) and the spongiotrophoblast marker Tpbpa were reduced in Sox21-KD when compared with scramble control cells (Fig. 3, E and F). Moreover, we analyzed the expression of two labyrinthine trophoblast progenitor markers, Epcam and Ly6e (24Ueno M. Lee L.K. Chhabra A. Kim Y.J. Sasidharan R. Van Handel B. Wang Y. Kamata M. Kamran P. Sereti K.-I. Ardehali R. Jiang M. Mikkola H.K. c-Met-dependent multipotent labyrinth trophoblast progenitors establish placental exchange interface.Dev.

Ly6e expression is restricted to syncytiotrophoblast cells of the mouse placenta.Placenta. 2013; 34: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and found that both were maintained in differentiating Sox21-KD cells (Fig. 4G). We also examined RNA expression of Ly6e and the spongiotrophoblast marker Tssc3 at early differentiation time points (within 24 h from removal of feeder conditioned medium and FGF4) and found that they were both significantly up-regulated in Sox21-KD compared with scramble control (data not shown). Finally, during differentiation, labyrinthine markers Gcm1 and Muc1 were more highly up-regulated in Sox21-KD cells compared with the scramble control (Fig. 4H). These findings suggest that Sox21 knockdown favored induction of the labyrinthine lineage over that of the spongiotrophoblast and TGC lineages. We also analyzed gene expression of several Sox family members, including Sox1, -3, -5, -8, and -13, in Sox21 knockdown cells during differentiation and found that Sox5 and -13 were up-regulated within 24 h of FGF4/feeder conditioned medium removal (data not shown). To determine how sustained expression of Sox21 may affect TSC, we next created a stable TSC line where an HA-tagged version of Sox21 was under the control of a CMV promoter. Empty vector (control) and Sox21-HA-transfected TSCs manifested a similar epithelial morphology when cultured under growth conditions (Fig. 5A). Sox21-HA and control cells showed no difference in proliferation or apoptosis (data not shown). In the presence of FGF4-H and CM, mRNA levels of Sox21 were eight times higher in Sox21-HA compared with control TSCs. During differentiation, Sox21-HA-transfected TSCs down-regulated Sox21 to a lesser extent, maintaining an average of 3-fold higher expression of Sox21 throughout differentiation (Fig. 5B). To better quantify the percentage of Sox21-HA-positive cells, we evaluated the number of such cells during differentiation and found them to progressively decrease as expected (Fig. 5C). To determine whether Sox21 overexpression maintains TSC proliferation under differentiating conditions, we quantified the percentage of phosphohistone H3 (pHH3)-positive cells among both HA-positive and HA-negative cells in the same subculture. Phosphohistone H3 is a proliferation marker that is specific to late G2 and the four phases of mitosis (26Hendzel M.J. Wei Y. Mancini M.A. Van Hooser A. Ranalli T. Brinkley B.R. Bazett-Jones D.P.

https://openalex.org/W1862962260,"From 2008-2013, the European indication for panitumumab required that patients' tumor KRAS exon 2 mutation status was known prior to starting treatment. To evaluate physician awareness of panitumumab prescribing information and how physicians prescribe panitumumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), two European multi-country, cross-sectional, observational studies were initiated in 2012: a physician survey and a medical records review. The first two out of three planned rounds for each study are reported.The primary objective in the physician survey was to estimate the prevalence of KRAS testing, and in the medical records review, it was to evaluate the effect of test results on patterns of panitumumab use. The medical records review study also included a pathologists' survey.In the physician survey, nearly all oncologists (299/301) were aware of the correct panitumumab indication and the need to test patients' tumor KRAS status before treatment with panitumumab. Nearly all oncologists (283/301) had in the past 6 months of clinical practice administered panitumumab correctly to mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS status. In the medical records review, 97.5% of participating oncologists (77/79) conducted a KRAS test for all of their patients prior to prescribing panitumumab. Four patients (1.3%) did not have tumor KRAS mutation status tested prior to starting panitumumab treatment. Approximately one-quarter of patients (85/306) were treated with panitumumab and concurrent oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy; of these, 83/85 had confirmed wild-type KRAS status prior to starting panitumumab treatment. All 56 referred laboratories that participated used a Conformité Européenne-marked or otherwise validated KRAS detection method, and nearly all (55/56) participated in a quality assurance scheme.There was a high level of knowledge amongst oncologists around panitumumab prescribing information and the need to test and confirm patients' tumors as being wild-type KRAS prior to treatment with panitumumab, with or without concurrent oxaliplatin-containing therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2148762154,"Severely immunocompromised state during advanced stage of HIV-1 infection has been linked to functionally defective antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs). The molecular mechanisms behind DC impairment are still obscure. We investigated changes in DC function and association of key regulators of cytokine signaling during different stages of HIV-1 infection and following antiretroviral therapy (ART).Phenotypic and functional characteristics of circulating myeloid DCs (mDCs) in 56 ART-naive patients (23 in early and 33 in advanced stage of disease), 36 on ART and 24 healthy controls were evaluated. Sixteen patients were studied longitudinally prior-to and 6 months after the start of ART. For functional studies, monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs) were evaluated for endocytosis, allo-stimulation and cytokine secretion. The expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and other regulators of cytokine signaling was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR.The ability to respond to an antigenic stimulation was severely impaired in patients in advanced HIV-1 disease which showed partial recovery in the treated group. Mo-DCs from patients with advanced HIV-disease remained immature with low allo-stimulation and reduced cytokine secretion even after TLR-4 mediated stimulation ex-vivo. The cells had an increased expression of negative regulatory factors like SOCS-1, SOCS-3, SH2-containing phosphatase (SHP)-1 and a reduced expression of positive regulators like Janus kinase (JAK)2 and Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)1. A functional recovery after siRNA mediated silencing of SOCS-1 in these mo-DCs confirms the role of negative regulatory factors in functional impairment of these cells.Functionally defective DCs in advanced stage of HIV-1 infection seems to be due to imbalanced state of negative and positive regulatory gene expression. Whether this is a cause or effect of increased viral replication at this stage of disease, needs further investigation. The information may be useful in design of novel therapeutic targets for better management of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2180582387,"Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) generated from pyruvate is required for de novo synthesis of glycerol and glycogen in skeletal muscle. One possible pathway involves synthesis of PEP from the citric acid cycle intermediates via PEP carboxykinase, whereas another could involve reversal of pyruvate kinase (PK). Earlier studies have reported that reverse flux through PK can contribute carbon precursors for glycogen synthesis in muscle, but the physiological importance of this pathway remains uncertain especially in the setting of high plasma glucose. In addition, although PEP is a common intermediate for both glyconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis, the importance of reverse PK in de novo glycerol synthesis has not been examined. Here we studied the contribution of reverse PK to synthesis of glycogen and the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols in skeletal muscle of animals with high plasma glucose. Rats received a single intraperitoneal bolus of glucose, glycerol, and lactate under a fed or fasted state. Only one of the three substrates was (13)C-labeled in each experiment. After 3 h of normal awake activity, the animals were sacrificed, and the contribution from each substrate to glycogen and the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols was evaluated. The fraction of (13)C labeling in glycogen and the glycerol moiety exceeded the possible contribution from either plasma glucose or muscle oxaloacetate. The reverse PK served as a common route for both glyconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis in the skeletal muscle of rats with high plasma glucose. The activity of pyruvate carboxylase was low in muscle, and no PEP carboxykinase activity was detected."

The S-box represents an important factor that affects the performance of AES on each of these factors. A number of techniques have been presented in the literature, which have attempted to improve the performance of the S-box byte-substitution. This paper proposes a new S-box architecture, defining it as ultra low power, robustly parallel and highly efficient in terms of area. The architecture is discussed for both CMOS and FPGA platforms, and the pipelined architecture of the proposed S-box is presented for further time savings and higher throughput along with higher hardware resources utilization. A performance analysis and comparison of the proposed architecture is also conducted with those achieved by the existing techniques. The results of the comparison verify the outperformance of the proposed architecture in terms of power, delay and size."
https://openalex.org/W2102337662,"HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) are the only viral antigens present on the virus surface and serve as the key targets for virus-neutralizing antibodies. However, HIV-1 deploys multiple strategies to shield the vulnerable sites on its Env from neutralizing antibodies. The V1V2 domain located at the apex of the HIV-1 Env spike is known to encompass highly variable loops, but V1V2 also contains immunogenic conserved elements recognized by cross-reactive antibodies. This study evaluates human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against V2 epitopes which overlap with the conserved integrin α4β7-binding LDV/I motif, designated as the V2i (integrin) epitopes. We postulate that the V2i Abs have weak or no neutralizing activities because the V2i epitopes are often occluded from antibody recognition. To gain insights into the mechanisms of the V2i occlusion, we evaluated three elements at the distal end of the V1V2 domain shown in the structure of V2i epitope complexed with mAb 830A to be important for antibody recognition of the V2i epitope. Amino-acid substitutions at position 179 that restore the LDV/I motif had minimal effects on virus sensitivity to neutralization by most V2i mAbs. However, a charge change at position 153 in the V1 region significantly increased sensitivity of subtype C virus ZM109 to most V2i mAbs. Separately, a disulfide bond introduced to stabilize the hypervariable region of V2 loop also enhanced virus neutralization by some V2i mAbs, but the effects varied depending on the virus. These data demonstrate that multiple elements within the V1V2 domain act independently and in a virus-dependent fashion to govern the antibody recognition and accessibility of V2i epitopes, suggesting the need for multi-pronged strategies to counter the escape and the shielding mechanisms obstructing the V2i Abs from neutralizing HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W1924719233,"In this study, six 2-phenylnaphthalenes with hydroxyl groups were synthesized in high yields by the demethylation of the corresponding methoxy-2-phenylnaphthalenes, and one 2-phenylnaphthalene with an amino group was obtained by hydrogenation. All of the 2-phenylnaphthalene derivatives were evaluated for cytotoxicity, and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) against human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells was also determined. The SAR results revealed that cytotoxicity was markedly promoted by the hydroxyl group at the C-7 position of the naphthalene ring. The introduction of hydroxyl groups at the C-6 position of the naphthalene ring and the C-4' position of the phenyl ring fairly enhanced cytotoxicity, but the introduction of a hydroxyl group at the C-3' position of the phenyl ring slightly decreased cytotoxicity. Overall, 6,7-dihydroxy-2-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)naphthalene (PNAP-6h) exhibited the best cytotoxicity, with an IC50 value of 4.8 μM against the MCF-7 cell line, and showed low toxicity toward normal human mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A). PNAP-6h led to cell arrest at the S phase, most likely due to increasing levels of p21 and p27 and decreasing levels of cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, and CDK2. In addition, PNAP-6h decreased CDK1 and cyclin B1 expression, most likely leading to G2/M arrest, and induced morphological changes, such as nuclear shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, and nuclear hypercondensation, as observed by Hoechst 33342 staining. PNAP-6h induced apoptosis, most likely by the promotion of Fas expression, increased PARP activity, caspase-7, caspase-8, and caspase-9 expression, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and the phosphorylation of p38, and decreased the phosphorylation of ERK. This study provides the first demonstration of the cytotoxicity of PNAPs against MCF-7 cells and elucidates the mechanism underlying PNAP-induced cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2179363136,"Background Mutations in GJB2, which encodes connexin 26 (Cx26), a cochlear gap junction protein, represent a major cause of pre-lingual, non-syndromic deafness. The degeneration of the organ of Corti observed in Cx26 mutant—associated deafness is thought to be a secondary pathology of hearing loss. Here we focused on abnormal development of the organ of Corti followed by degeneration including outer hair cell (OHC) loss. Methods We investigated the crucial factors involved in late-onset degeneration and loss of OHC by ultrastructural observation, immunohistochemistry and protein analysis in our Cx26-deficient mice (Cx26f/fP0Cre). Results In ultrastructural observations of Cx26f/fP0Cre mice, OHCs changed shape irregularly, and several folds or notches were observed in the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the mutant OHCs had a flat surface compared with the characteristic wavy surface structure of OHCs of normal mice. Protein analysis revealed an increased protein level of caveolin-2 (CAV2) in Cx26f/fP0Cre mouse cochlea. In immunohistochemistry, a remarkable accumulation of CAV2 was observed in Cx26f/fP0Cre mice. In particular, this accumulation of CAV2 was mainly observed around OHCs, and furthermore this accumulation was observed around the shrunken site of OHCs with an abnormal hourglass-like shape. Conclusions The deformation of OHCs and the accumulation of CAV2 in the organ of Corti may play a crucial role in the progression of, or secondary OHC loss in, GJB2-associated deafness. Investigation of these molecular pathways, including those involving CAV2, may contribute to the elucidation of a new pathogenic mechanism of GJB2-associated deafness and identify effective targets for new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2204413317,"We demonstrated for the first time an outstanding ability of rosiglitazone to mediate a profound enhancement of LA-12-induced apoptosis associated with activation of mitochondrial pathway in human colon cancer cells. This effect was preferentially observed in the G1 cell cycle phase, independent on p53 and PPARγ proteins, and accompanied with significant changes of selected Bcl-2 family protein levels. Further stimulation of cooperative synergic cytotoxic action of rosiglitazone and LA-12 was demonstrated in the cells deficient for PTEN, where mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was more stimulated and G1-phase-associated dying was reinforced. Our results suggest that combined treatment with rosiglitazone and LA-12 might be promising anticancer strategy in colon-derived tumours regardless of their p53 status, and also favourable in those defective in PTEN function."
https://openalex.org/W2117923612,"Phospholipase D (PLD) hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine to produce phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline. It has two isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, which are differentially expressed depending on the cell type. In mast cells it plays an important role in signal transduction. The aim of the present study was to clarify the role of PLD2 in the secretory pathway. RBL-2H3 cells, a mast cell line, transfected to overexpress catalytically active (PLD2CA) and inactive (PLD2CI) forms of PLD2 were used. Previous observations showed that the Golgi complex was well organized in CA cells, but was disorganized and dispersed in CI cells. Furthermore, in CI cells, the microtubule organizing center was difficult to identify and the microtubules were disorganized. These previous observations demonstrated that PLD2 is important for maintaining the morphology and organization of the Golgi complex. To further understand the role of PLD2 in secretory and vesicular trafficking, the role of PLD2 in the secretory process was investigated. Incorporation of sialic acid was used to follow the synthesis and transport of glycoconjugates in the cell lines. The modified sialic acid was subsequently detected by labeling with a fluorophore or biotin to visualize the localization of the molecule after a pulse-chase for various times. Glycoconjugate trafficking was slower in the CI cells and labeled glycans took longer to reach the plasma membrane. Furthermore, in CI cells sialic acid glycans remained at the plasma membrane for longer periods of time compared to RBL-2H3 cells. These results suggest that PLD2 activity plays an important role in regulating glycoconjugate trafficking in mast cells."
https://openalex.org/W1805741786,"Introduction Episodes of acute adenolymphangitis (ADL) are often the first clinical sign of lymphatic filariasis (LF). They are often accompanied by swelling of the affected limb, inflammation, fever, and general malaise and lead to the progression of lymphedema. Although ADL episodes have been studied for a century or more, questions still remain as to their etiology. We quantified antibody levels to pathogens that potentially contribute to ADL episodes during and after an episode among lymphedema patients in Léogâne, Haiti. We estimated the proportion of ADL episodes hypothesized to be attributed to specific pathogens. Methods We measured antibody levels to specific pathogens during and following an ADL episode among 41 lymphedema patients enrolled in a cohort study in Léogâne, Haiti. We calculated the absolute and relative changes in antibody levels between the ADL and convalescent time points. We calculated the proportion of episodes that demonstrated a two-fold increase in antibody level for several bacterial, fungal, and filarial pathogens. Results Our results showed the greatest proportion of two-fold changes in antibody levels for the carbohydrate antigen Streptococcus group A, followed by IgG2 responses to a soluble filarial antigen (BpG2), Streptococcal Pyrogenic Exotoxin B, and an antigen for the fungal pathogen Candida. When comparing the median antibody level during the ADL episode to the median antibody level at the convalescent time point, only the antigens for Pseudomonas species (P-value = 0.0351) and Streptolysin O (P-value = 0.0074) showed a significant result. Conclusion Although our results are limited by the lack of a control group and few antibody responses, they provide some evidence for infection with Streptococcus A as a potential contributing factor to ADL episodes. Our results add to the current evidence and illustrate the importance of determining the causal role of bacterial and fungal pathogens and immunological antifilarial response in ADL episodes."
https://openalex.org/W2143518993,"For many parallel applications of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies short barcodes able to accurately multiplex a large number of samples are demanded. To address these competitive requirements, the use of error-correcting codes is advised. Current barcoding systems are mostly built from short random error-correcting codes, a feature that strongly limits their multiplexing accuracy and experimental scalability. To overcome these problems on sequencing systems impaired by mismatch errors, the alternative use of binary BCH and pseudo-quaternary Hamming codes has been proposed. However, these codes either fail to provide a fine-scale with regard to size of barcodes (BCH) or have intrinsic poor error correcting abilities (Hamming). Here, the design of barcodes from shortened binary BCH codes and quaternary Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes is introduced. Simulation results show that although accurate barcoding systems of high multiplexing capacity can be obtained with any of these codes, using quaternary LDPC codes may be particularly advantageous due to the lower rates of read losses and undetected sample misidentification errors. Even at mismatch error rates of 10(-2) per base, 24-nt LDPC barcodes can be used to multiplex roughly 2000 samples with a sample misidentification error rate in the order of 10(-9) at the expense of a rate of read losses just in the order of 10(-6)."
