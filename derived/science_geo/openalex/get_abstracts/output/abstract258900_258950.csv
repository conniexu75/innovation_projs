https://openalex.org/W2164826784,"There has never been a wholesale way of identifying neurons that are monosynaptically connected either to some other cell group or, especially, to a single cell. The best available tools, transsynaptic tracers, are unable to distinguish weak direct connections from strong indirect ones. Furthermore, no tracer has proven potent enough to label any connected neurons whatsoever when starting from a single cell. Here we present a transsynaptic tracer that crosses only one synaptic step, unambiguously identifying cells directly presynaptic to the starting population. Based on rabies virus, it is genetically targetable, allows high-level expression of any gene of interest in the synaptically coupled neurons, and robustly labels connections made to single cells. This technology should enable a far more detailed understanding of neural connectivity than has previously been possible."
https://openalex.org/W1991762922,"Reliable activation of inhibitory pathways is essential for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition during cortical activity. Little is known, however, about the activation of these pathways at the level of the local neocortical microcircuit. We report a disynaptic inhibitory pathway among neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs). Inhibitory responses were evoked in layer 5 PCs following stimulation of individual neighboring PCs with trains of action potentials. The probability for inhibition between PCs was more than twice that of direct excitation, and inhibitory responses increased as a function of rate and duration of presynaptic discharge. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings indicated that inhibition originated from PC apical and tuft dendrites. Multineuron whole-cell recordings from PCs and interneurons combined with morphological reconstructions revealed the mediating interneurons as Martinotti cells. Martinotti cells received facilitating synapses from PCs and formed reliable inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of neighboring PCs. We describe this feedback pathway and propose it as a central mechanism for regulation of cortical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2058459224,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) has been implicated in major neurological disorders, but its role in normal neuronal function is largely unknown. Here we show that GSK3β mediates an interaction between two major forms of synaptic plasticity in the brain, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD). In rat hippocampal slices, GSK3β inhibitors block the induction of LTD. Furthermore, the activity of GSK3β is enhanced during LTD via activation of PP1. Conversely, following the induction of LTP, there is inhibition of GSK3β activity. This regulation of GSK3β during LTP involves activation of NMDA receptors and the PI3K-Akt pathway and disrupts the ability of synapses to undergo LTD for up to 1 hr. We conclude that the regulation of GSK3β activity provides a powerful mechanism to preserve information encoded during LTP from erasure by subsequent LTD, perhaps thereby permitting the initial consolidation of learnt information."
https://openalex.org/W1994778254,"Accumulation of AMPA receptors at synapses is a fundamental feature of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Stargazin, a member of the TARP family, is an AMPAR auxiliary subunit allowing interaction of the receptor with scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density, such as PSD-95. How PSD-95 and Stargazin regulate AMPAR number in synaptic membranes remains elusive. We show, using single quantum dot and FRAP imaging in live hippocampal neurons, that exchange of AMPAR by lateral diffusion between extrasynaptic and synaptic sites mostly depends on the interaction of Stargazin with PSD-95 and not upon the GluR2 AMPAR subunit C terminus. Disruption of interactions between Stargazin and PSD-95 strongly increases AMPAR surface diffusion, preventing AMPAR accumulation at postsynaptic sites. Furthermore, AMPARs and Stargazin diffuse as complexes in and out synapses. These results propose a model in which the Stargazin-PSD-95 interaction plays a key role to trap and transiently stabilize diffusing AMPARs in the postsynaptic density."

https://openalex.org/W2143425403,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury continues to be a fatal complication that can follow liver surgery or transplantation. We have investigated the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in hepatic I/R injury using an in vivo mouse model. Here we report that I/R triggers several-fold increases in the hepatic levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which originate from hepatocytes, Kupffer, and endothelial cells. The I/R-induced increased tissue endocannabinoid levels positively correlate with the degree of hepatic damage and serum TNF-alpha, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-2 levels. Furthermore, a brief exposure of hepatocytes to various oxidants (H2O2 and peroxynitrite) or inflammatory stimuli (endotoxin and TNF-alpha) also increases endocannabinoid levels. Activation of CB2 cannabinoid receptors by JWH133 protects against I/R damage by decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration, tissue and serum TNF-alpha, MIP-1alpha and MIP-2 levels, tissue lipid peroxidation, and expression of adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in vivo. JWH133 also attenuates the TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (HLSECs) and the adhesion of human neutrophils to HLSECs in vitro. Consistent with the protective role of CB2 receptor activation, CB2-/- mice develop increased I/R-induced tissue damage and proinflammatory phenotype. These findings suggest that oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory stimuli may trigger endocannabinoid production, and indicate that targeting CB2 cannabinoid receptors may represent a novel protective strategy against I/R injury. We also demonstrate that CB2-/- mice have a normal hemodynamic profile."
https://openalex.org/W2091479071,"Induction of type I interferons can be triggered by viral components through Toll-like receptors or intracellular viral receptors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I. Here, we demonstrate that the TRAF (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor) family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) plays an important role in interferon induction through both retinoic acid-inducible gene I- and Toll-like receptor-dependent pathways. TANK forms complexes with both upstream signal mediators, such as Cardif/MAVS/IPS-1/VISA, TRIF (Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β), and TRAF3 and downstream mediators TANK-binding kinase 1, inducible IκB kinase, and interferon regulatory factor 3. In addition, it synergizes with these signaling components in interferon induction. Specific knockdown of TANK results in reduced type I interferon production, increased viral titers, and enhanced cell sensitivity to viral infection. Thus, TANK may be a critical adaptor that regulates the assembly of the TANK-binding kinase 1-inducible IκB kinase complex with upstream signaling molecules in multiple antiviral pathways.

These cytokines bind to a common receptor, the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), leading to induction of a large set of genes important in antiviral responses (1Le Page C. Genin P. Baines M.G. Hiscott J.

Induction of IFN is triggered by microbial components termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as viral RNA and DNA, which can be viewed as a molecular “signature” of the invading pathogens (4Janeway Jr., C.A.

A major class of cellular proteins capable of recognizing pathogens is the family of membrane receptors termed Toll-like receptors (4Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev.

In addition, many types of cells also have TLR-independent, intracellular detection systems to sense viral invasion and initiate innate immune responses (8Jefferies C.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Trends Mol.

Recent studies have identified an RNA helicase-CARD-containing protein RIG-I and its homologue, Helicard/Mda5, as major intracellular receptors for viral double-stranded RNA. Upon recognition of different subsets of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, individual TLRs trigger distinct innate immune responses via recruitment of different MyD88 adaptor family members, primarily MyD88 and Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) (5Medzhitov R.

These adaptors function as a platform to organize downstream molecules into signaling complexes, leading to activation of multiple signal cascades, particularly the NF-κB and IFN pathways, eventually resulting in specific cellular responses against different types of pathogens. Activation of NF-κB pathway requires the IκB kinase (IKK) signalosome, a signaling complex composed of two closely related kinase subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and a regulatory subunit NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO, also called IKKγ) (15Krappmann D.

Recently, we found that TRAF3 plays a critical role in TLR as well as viral-induced IFN activation (35Oganesyan G. Saha S.K. Guo B. He J.Q. Shahangian A. Zarnegar B. Perry A. Cheng G.

Because both TBK1 and IKKi are able to interact with an adaptor protein TANK (38Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Nomura F. Kawai T. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it is possible that TANK may participate in IFN induction pathways by organizing TBK1·IKKi signaling complexes. TANK was originally identified as a protein associated with TRAF3 (40Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), but its function has remained elusive. No studies have been reported on the function of either TANK itself or the TANK·TBK1·IKKi complex in IFN induction. Recent findings on the role of TBK1·IKKi as well as TRAF3 in IFN induction shed new light on the function of TANK. Results from this study indicate that TANK might be an important modulator of type I IFN induction in both TLR-dependent and intracellular detection mechanisms during viral infections. Reagents—Poly(IC) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. LPS was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Antibody reagents included anti-Myc and anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-TANK, anti-TBK, anti-IKKi, anti-HA, anti-IRF3, and anti-TRAF3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-TANK (Biovision, Mountain View, CA), anti-Cardif (AXXORA, San Diego, CA), anti-IRF3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), and anti-pSTAT1, anti-phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and pp38 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-TBK (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). FLAG-TANK, HA-TRAF3, HA-TBK1, and HA-IKKi constructs were described previously. Full-length TRIF and Mda5 was cloned into Myc-pCMV eukaryotic expression vector. RIG-I construct was a gift from T. Fujita. Murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were generated by culturing the bone marrow cells for 7 days in media containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Reporter Gene Assays—Luciferase assays were preformed as previously described (42Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 43Chin A.I. Shu J. Shan Shi C. Yao Z. Kehrl J.H. Cheng G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6665-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells seeded on 12-well plates were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid, and various expression plasmids were indicated. In each experiment total amounts of DNA in each sample were kept constant by supplementation with the appropriate empty parental expression vector(s). For normalization of transfection efficiency, each transfection included 50 ng of a pCMV-LacZ control plasmid, which constitutively expresses β-galactosidase. 36 h after transfection cells were harvested, and firefly luciferase activities were analyzed using a luciferase assay kit (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. -Fold induction was calculated for each sample by dividing the luciferase activity, normalized to β-galactosidase activity, by that observed in the sample containing only empty parental expression vectors. To measure luciferase activity in RAW cells, RAW cells seeded on 6-well plates were transfected with plasmids indicated, and 24 h after transfection cells were stimulated with LPS or poly(IC) or infected with virus for 24 h, and luciferase activities were measured. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—293T cell transfection was performed as described (42Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 43Chin A.I. Shu J. Shan Shi C. Yao Z. Kehrl J.H. Cheng G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6665-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For Western analyses, protein samples in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted using standard methods. For immunoprecipitation, total cell lysates were pre-cleared with Sepharose protein G beads for 1 h at 4°C. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of specific antibody or control IgG for 16 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with the lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blot. RNA Interference—In siRNA experiments, double-stranded RNA duplexes composed of 21-nucleotide oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. The siRNA oligonucleotide used for targeting murine TANK was GAC UUU CUG GGA CCU UAA ATT. The siRNA oligonucleotide targeting human TANK was UCA CUU CAA CAG ACU AUU ATT. siRNA duplexes were transfected into cells in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GFP siRNA was used as a control. 48 h after transfection cells were used for further experiments. To examine the effect of silencing TANK on IFN reporter gene activity in RAW cells, the oligonucleotides targeting murine TANK sequences were cloned into expression plasmid pBS-hH1–3 as described (44Qin X.F. An D.S. Chen I.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) and transfected into RAW cells. Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) Infection and Plaque Assay—For TANK-induced anti-viral response, 293T cells in 12-well plate were transfected with empty vector or pCMV-FLAG-TANK plasmid. 24 h after transfection cells were infected with VSV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for 24 h. To examine the effect of silencing TANK on VSV infection, MEFs were transfected with siRNA oligo duplexes for TANK or GFP using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and 48 h after siRNA treatment MEFs were infected with VSV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. Virus yield was measured in culture supernatants collected from VSV-infected 293T cells or MEFs by standard plaque assay. Briefly, Vero cells were infected with serial dilutions of recovered viruses for 1 h and were overlaid with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% low melting agarose. After 24 h of incubation, plates were stained with crystal violet, and plaques were counted. IFN Production—To measure IFN production, 293T cells transfected with plasmids or infected with viruses were cultured for 24 h. Culture supernatants were collected, and IFNβ levels were determined by IFN ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (PBL Biomedical Laboratories). Neutralizing Type I IFN Activities—To block IFN activities in culture supernatants, an anti-human IFNα antibody and an anti-human IFNβ antibody (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) were mixed together as anti-IFNα/β antibodies at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Culture supernatant from 293T cells transfected with TANK was treated with anti-IFNα/β antibodies or nonspecific IgG for 1 h. Then conditioned media were incubated with fresh 293T cells for 1 h. Cells were lysed, and STAT1 phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot. To block binding of IFNα/β to the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), we utilized a mouse monoclonal antibody against human IFNα/β receptor (anti-IFNAR2) (PBL Biomedical Laboratories) or nonspecific isotype control mouse-IgG2a at final concentrations of 25 μg/ml. Cells were pretreated with anti-IFNAR2 antibodies or control antibody for 30 min and then infected with Sendai virus for 4 h. Cells were lysed, and STAT1 phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot. TANK Is Able to Induce IFN Activation—As an initial step to determine whether TANK is involved in the type I IFN activation pathway, we analyzed the effect of TANK on activation of IFN promoter. As shown in Fig. 1, A–C, overexpression of TANK alone was able to induce considerable IFN transcription in a dosage-dependent manner as measured by a reporter plasmid carrying either an IFNβ or IFN-stimulated response element promoter, which is regulated by IRFs. In accordance with early publications, TANK itself could slightly induce NF-κB transcription. We also confirmed the role of TANK in the induction of type I IFN at protein level. Production of endogenous IFNβ could be detected in the culture supernatants of 293T cells transfected with TANK in a dosage-dependent manner, although we could not detect IFN with lower concentrations of TANK, probably because the amount of IFN produced might be below the detection limit of the ELISA system. As an alternative way to examine the type I IFNs in the culture supernatants, we investigated whether type I IFNs induced by TANK could lead to the activation of STAT1. We conducted experiments using a mixture of anti-IFNα/β antibodies to neutralize IFN activities in the culture supernatants. As shown in Fig. 1E, the addition of conditional media (CM) collected from TANK-transfected cells led to STAT1 phosphorylation, as opposed to CM from cells transfected with empty vector. Treatment using anti-IFNα/β antibodies but not nonspecific control IgG clearly reduced STAT1 activation, indicating that type I IFNs in the culture supernatants were responsible for this effect. Because type I IFNs provide immediate innate antiviral defense, we then analyzed the effect of TANK-induced IFN on VSV infection. VSV is a cytopathic virus and is very sensitive to IFNs and has been widely used in IFN antiviral assays (19Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J.

Nature. 2004; 432: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with an empty vector or a plasmid encoding TANK. Subsequently, cells were infected with VSV for 24 h, and viral titer was measured by plaque assay. As shown in Fig. 1F, overexpression of TANK reduced virus growth as supernatant from TANK-expressing cells had much lower viral titer. These results indicate that TANK has the ability to furnish antiviral responses through induction of type I IFN. Involvement of TANK in Multiple Viral Detection Pathways—To more directly investigate the involvement of TANK in virally induced type I IFN production, we examined the effect of silencing of TANK on IFNβ induction by viral infection. As fibroblast cells, 293T cells lack most of the TLRs; therefore, IFN response is likely mediated through intracellular detection pathways. Knockdown of endogenous TANK protein in 293T cells decreased IFNβ transcription induced by Sendai virus infection or transfection of poly(IC), which has been shown to mimic viral double-stranded RNA (Fig. 2A). Consequently, 293T cells treated with TANK siRNA, but not GFP siRNA, produced much less IFN protein in response to poly(IC) transfection and Sendai virus infection (Fig. 2B). The efficiency of siRNA to reduce TANK protein levels in human and murine cells is shown in Fig. 2C. We further elucidated TANK-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation trigged by viral infection. Although viral infection induced strong STAT1 phosphorylation in cells with control siRNA, silencing TANK expression led to impaired STAT1 phosphorylation during viral infection (Fig. 2D). To further confirm the role of type I IFN in TANK-dependent phosphorylation of STAT1, we utilized a neutralizing antibody against IFNAR to block binding of type I IFNs with their receptor. The addition of the neutralizing anti-human IFNAR antibody but not isotype control significantly inhibited viral induced STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). These data together demonstrate that type I IFNs induced by TANK was responsible for TANK-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation. We also monitored viral-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in murine BMMs, which may use TLR-dependent and -independent mechanisms to detect viral infection. As shown in Fig. 2F, knocking down TANK protein severely reduced virally induced STAT1 phosphorylation. Next, we investigated the involvement of TANK in intracellular anti-viral response in MEFs. MEFs treated with siRNA duplexes specific for TANK were infected with VSV. TBK1-deficient MEFs were also included as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 3, almost all of TBK1-deficient cells died post-VSV infection because of defects in IFN induction. However, IFN pretreatment could reduce such VSV-induced cell death. As for TBK1-deficient cells, but with a lesser extent, MEFs treated with siRNA duplexes specific for TANK also exhibited accelerated cell death upon VSV infection (Fig. 3, A and C). Accordingly, MEFs with knockdown of TANK had much higher viral titer (Fig. 3B). These data point out that TANK may play an important role in innate immunity against viral infection. Association of TANK with the Adaptor Protein Cardif—Induction of type I interferons in fibroblasts is triggered by intracellular viral receptors such as RIG-I. Recent studies demonstrate that Cardif/MAVS/IPS-1/VISA is a critical adaptor protein for the RIG-I-mediated NF-κB and IFN activation. To further elucidate the mechanism of TANK-mediated IFN induction by viral infection, we examined the involvement of TANK in RIG-I pathways. We observed that knockdown of TANK protein inhibited activation of type I IFN promoters by RIG-I (Fig. 4A). We also found that TANK could synergize with Cardif to induce IFN promoter transcription (Fig. 4B), Conversely, knockdown of TANK reduced IFNβ production induced by Cardif (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, TANK and Mda5/Helicard, a homologue of RIG-I, together had a strong synergy with TBK1 in IFN induction (data not shown). These data suggest that the TANK may participate in cytoplasmic detection pathways. The involvement of TANK in the RIG-I pathway promoted us to examine the interaction between TANK and signaling molecules in this pathway. Although we were unable to detect an interaction between TANK and RIG-I in our overexpression system, we did find interaction of TANK with the adaptor protein Cardif/MAVS/IPS-1/VISA. When cell lysates from 293T cells transfected with FLAG-TANK and Myc-Cardif were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and probed with anti-myc antibody, Cardif was detected in TANK immunoprecipitates. Similarly, TANK was also found associated with Cardif immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4D). As discussed below, we also have detected endogenous TANK and Cardif interaction in MEFs infected with Sendai virus (see Fig. 7D). Knockdown of TANK Protein Attenuates Induction of IFN by TLRs—In addition to intracellular viral detection pathways, another major mechanism responsible for IFN activation is through TLRs. We then examined the function of TANK in TLR-induced IFN activation in macrophages. The murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was co-transfected with a TANK construct and either an NF-κB or an IFNβ luciferase reporter plasmid. As expected, stimulation of RAW cells with TLR ligands led to induction of NF-κB and IFN activities (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, introduction of TANK into macrophages enhanced IFNβ transcription in response to TLR3 or TLR4 stimulation"
https://openalex.org/W2076766472,"The action of visual experience on visual cortical circuits is maximal during a critical period of postnatal development. The long-term effects of this experience are likely mediated by signaling cascades regulating experience-dependent gene transcription. Developmental modifications of these pathways could explain the difference in plasticity between the young and adult cortex. We studied the pathways linking experience-dependent activation of ERK to CREB-mediated gene expression in vivo. In juvenile mice, visual stimulation that activates CREB-mediated gene transcription also induced ERK-dependent MSK and histone H3 phosphorylation and H3-H4 acetylation, an epigenetic mechanism of gene transcription activation. In adult animals, ERK and MSK were still inducible; however, visual stimulation induced weak CREB-mediated gene expression and H3-H4 posttranslational modifications. Stimulation of histone acetylation in adult animals by means of trichostatin promoted ocular dominance plasticity. Thus, differing, experience-dependent activations of signaling molecules might be at the basis of the differences in experience-dependent plasticity between juvenile and adult cortex."

Here, we present the high-resolution structure of the Kv7.4 A-domain Tail together with biochemical experiments that show that the domain is a self-assembling, parallel, four-stranded coiled coil. Structural analysis and biochemical studies indicate conservation of the coiled coil in all Kv7 subtypes and that a limited set of interactions encode assembly specificity determinants.

To investigate this, in the present study we examined the binding of radiolabeled FVIIa to endothelial cells and its subsequent internalization. <sup>125</sup>I-FVIIa bound to non-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in time- and dose-dependent manner. The binding is specific and independent of TF and negatively charged phospholipids.

FVIIa binding to EPCR is confirmed by demonstrating a marked increase in <sup>125</sup>I-FVIIa binding to CHO cells that had been stably transfected with EPCR compared with the wild-type.

FVIIa binding to EPCR failed to accelerate FVIIa activation of factor X or protease-activated receptors. FVIIa binding to EPCR was shown to facilitate FVIIa endocytosis. Pharmacological concentrations of FVIIa were found to impair partly the EPCR-dependent protein C activation and APC-mediated cell signaling. Overall, the present data provide convincing evidence that EPCR serves as a cellular binding site for FVII/FVIIa. Further studies are needed to evaluate the pathophysiological consequences and relevance of FVIIa binding to EPCR."
https://openalex.org/W2123896359,"Nonvisual responses to light, such as photic entrainment of the circadian clock, involve intrinsically light-sensitive melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells as well as rod and cone photoreceptors. However, previous studies have been unable to demonstrate a specific contribution of cones in the photic control of circadian responses to light. Using a mouse model that specifically lacks mid-wavelength (MW) cones we show that these photoreceptors play a significant role in light entrainment and in phase shifting of the circadian oscillator. The contribution of MW cones is mainly observed for light exposures of short duration and toward the longer wavelength region of the spectrum, consistent with the known properties of this opsin. Modeling the contributions of the various photoreceptors stresses the importance of considering the particular spectral, temporal, and irradiance response domains of the photopigments when assessing their role and contribution in circadian responses to light."
https://openalex.org/W2033990975,"The urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR/CD87) are major regulators of extracellular matrix degradation and are involved in cell migration and invasion under physiological and pathological conditions. The uPA/uPAR system has been of great interest in cancer research because it is involved in the development of most invasive cancer phenotypes and is a strong predictor of poor patient survival. However, little is known about the role of uPA/uPAR in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the most aggressive type of lung cancer. We therefore determined whether uPA and uPAR are involved in generation of drug resistant SCLC cell phenotype.We screened six human SCLC cell lines for surface markers for putative stem and cancer cells. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), fluorescence microscopy and clonogenic assays to demonstrate uPAR expression in a subpopulation of cells derived from primary and metastatic SCLC cell lines. Cytotoxic assays were used to determine the sensitivity of uPAR-positive and uPAR-negative cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The uPAR-positive cells in all SCLC lines demonstrated multi-drug resistance, high clonogenic activity and co-expression of CD44 and MDR1, putative cancer stem cell markers.These data suggest that uPAR-positive cells may define a functionally important population of cancer cells in SCLC, which are resistant to traditional chemotherapies, and could serve as critical targets for more effective therapeutic interventions in SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2038956306,"We characterized the pro-apoptotic activity of two new synthesized isatin-Schiff base copper(II) complexes, obtained from isatin and 1,3-diaminopropane or 2-(2-aminoethyl)pyridine: (Cu(isapn)) and (Cu(isaepy)2), respectively. We demonstrated that these compounds trigger apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. The early induction of the p53/p21 system indicates a role for p53 in cell death, however, experiments carried out with small interfering RNA against p53, or with cells lacking p53, support that a p53-independent mechanism can also occur. The extent of apoptosis mirrors the kinetics of intracellular copper uptake. Particularly, Cu(isaepy)2 enters the cells more efficiently and specifically damages nuclei and mitochondria, as evidenced by atomic absorption analysis of copper content and by the extent of nuclear and mitochondrial integrity. Conversely, Cu(isapn), although less permeable, induces a wide-spread oxidative stress, as demonstrated by analyses of reactive oxygen species concentration, and oxidation of proteins and lipids. The increase of the antioxidant defense, through the overexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD, partially counteracts cell death; whereas retinoic acid-mediated differentiation completely rescues cells from apoptosis induced by both compounds. The activation of JNK- and Akt-mediated phosphorylative pathways has been found to be not functional for apoptosis induction. On the contrary, apoptosis significantly decreased when the analogous zinc complex was used or when Cu(isaepy)2 was incubated in the presence of a copper chelator. Altogether, our data provide evidence for a dual role of these copper(II) complexes: they are able to vehicle copper into the cell, thus producing reactive oxygen species, and could behave as delocalized lipophilic cation-like molecules, thus specifically targeting organelles."
https://openalex.org/W2167511923,"Abstract Three isoforms of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R), IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3, have different IP3-binding affinities and cooperativities. Here we report that the amino-terminal 604 residues of three mouse IP3R types exhibited Kd values of 49.5 ± 10.5, 14.0 ± 3.5, and 163.0 ± 44.4 nm, which are close to the intrinsic IP3-binding affinity previously estimated from the analysis of full-length IP3Rs. In contrast, residues 224–604 of IP3R1 and IP3R2 and residues 225–604 of IP3R3, which contain the IP3-binding core domain but not the suppressor domain, displayed an almost identical IP3-binding affinity with a Kd value of ∼2 nm. Addition of 100-fold excess of the suppressor domain did not alter the IP3-binding affinity of the IP3-binding core domain. Artificial chimeric proteins in which the suppressor domain was fused to the IP3-binding core domain from different isoforms exhibited IP3-binding affinity significantly different from those of the proteins composed of the native combination of the suppressor domain and the IP3-binding core domain. Systematic mutagenesis analyses showed that amino acid residues critical for type-3 receptor-specific IP3-binding affinity are involved in Glu-39, Ala-41, Asp-46, Met-127, Ala-154, Thr-155, Leu-162, Trp-168, Asn-173, Asn-176, and Val-179. These results indicate that the IP3-binding affinity of IP3Rs is specifically tuned through the intramolecular attenuation of IP3-binding affinity of the IP3-binding core domain by the amino-terminal suppressor domain. Moreover, the functional diversity in ligand sensitivity among IP3R isoforms originates from at least the structural difference identified on the suppressor domain."
https://openalex.org/W2079883670,"A fundamental property of circadian rhythms is their ability to persist under constant conditions. In Drosophila, the ventral Lateral Neurons (LNvs) are the pacemaker neurons driving circadian behavior under constant darkness. Wild-type flies are arrhythmic under constant illumination, but flies defective for the circadian photoreceptor CRY remain rhythmic. We found that flies overexpressing the pacemaker gene per or the morgue gene are also behaviorally rhythmic under constant light. Unexpectedly, the LNvs do not drive these rhythms: they are molecularly arrhythmic, and PDF—the neuropeptide they secrete to synchronize behavioral rhythms under constant darkness—is dispensable for rhythmicity in constant light. Molecular circadian rhythms are only found in a group of Dorsal Neurons: the DN1s. Thus, a subset of Dorsal Neurons shares with the LNvs the ability to function as pacemakers for circadian behavior, and its importance is promoted by light."

Using pharmacological inhibitors of the enzymatic activities of its subunits, we show here that the elastin peptide-driven ERK1/2 activation and subsequent pro-MMP-1 production, observed in skin fibroblasts when they are cultured in the presence of these peptides, rely on a membrane-bound sialidase activity. As lactose blocked this effect, the elastin receptor sialidase subunit, Neu-1, seemed to be involved. The use of a catalytically inactive form of Neu-1 and the small interfering RNA-mediated decrease of Neu-1 expression strongly support this view. Finally, we report that N-acetyl neuraminic acid can reproduce the effects of elastin peptides on both ERK1/2 activation and pro-MMP-1 production.

Elastin is the extracellular matrix protein responsible for the elasticity of tissues. It is more abundant in tissues where resilience is required, such as skin, lung, ligaments, or large arteries (1Kielty C.M. Sherratt M.J. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elastin is constituted of tropoelastin molecules covalently bound to each other by covalent cross-links (2Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Eur. J.

Consequently, it was hypothesized that the 61 and 55 kDa membrane-bound subunits corresponded to the lysosomal companions of β-Gal, respectively neuraminidase-1 (Neu-1, EC 3.2.1.18) and cathepsin A/protective protein (PPCA, EC 3.4.16.1) (26Callahan J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This view was strongly supported by the fact that Neu-1 and PPCA are found at the plasma membrane of several cell types (27Lukong K.E. Seyrantepe V. Landry K. Trudel S. Ahmad A. Gahl W.A.

Finally, a very recent report has readily identified the elastin receptor complex as the association of these three subunits (30Hinek A. Pshezhetsky A.V. von Itzstein M. Starcher B. J. Biol.

In the lysosome, PPCA protects β-Gal and Neu-1 from intralysosomal digestion independently of its serine protease activity by forming a complex with these enzymes (26Callahan J.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Importantly, it has been shown in vitro that the removal of β-Gal or PPCA hinders the formation of active neuraminidase, indicating that all three components of the complex are required for neuraminidase activity (33van der Horst G.T.

Our group has previously demonstrated that elastin hydrolysates and κ-elastin (kE), elastin peptides derived from the alcaline degradation of insoluble elastin, both stimulate the production of pro-MMP-1 in human skin fibroblasts (5Brassart B.

Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).The induction of signaling pathways by the elastin receptor complex is now commonly accepted but remains discussed, notably because a critical issue is undocumented: how is the elastin peptides binding information processed by the receptor, i.e. how does the receptor transduce this signal from the extracellular face of the membrane to the cytoplasmic one? This work aims at answering this important question.We show here that binding of elastin peptides to EBP stimulate Neu-1 sialidase activity. Using pharmacological and genetic techniques, we demonstrate that the induction of this sialidase activity is responsible for elastin receptor complex-dependent signaling assessed by measuring pro-MMP-1 production and ERK1/2 activation. Additionally, we show that the serine protease activity of PPCA is not required for this signaling. Finally, we suggest that the sialic acid released by Neu-1 activity could act as a second messenger and transduce elastin complex receptor signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Elastin peptides were prepared as described previously (5Brassart B. Fuchs P. Huet E. Alix A.J. Wallach J. Tamburro A.M. Delacoux F. Haye B. Emonard H. Hornebeck W. Debelle L. J. Biol.

Its purity was assessed by comparing its amino acid composition to that predicted from the elastin gene product. Soluble elastin peptides were obtained from insoluble elastin by organo-alkaline hydrolysis. This was achieved using 1 m KOH in 80% aqueous ethanol (36Debelle L. Alix A.J. Jacob M.P. Huvenne J.P.

Augé (Laboratoire de Chimie Organique Multifonctionnelle, University of Paris-Sud, France). Others reagents were from Sigma.Expression Plasmids—The –512ColA-luc plasmid encoding luciferase under the control of the MMP-1 promoter was generated by cloning the 5′ upstream sequence of human collagenase-1 (MMP-1) into the pGL3Basic reporter plasmid (Promega, Lyon, France), as described previously (37Rutter J.L. Benbow U. Coon C.I. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 322-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding Neu-1 neuraminidase (pSCTop-Neu-1) was kindly provided by Dr. A. d'Azzo (Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis).Neu-1-G68V Construct—The Neu-1-G68V mutant was obtained from the wild type plasmid using PCR site-directed mutagenesis. The target site was identified and two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation were synthesized (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France). The sequence of the two oligonucleotides with mutated bases are 5′-CTG TGG GTG AGC GTG AGA CAG ATC GGC 3′ and 5′ GAC ACC CAC TCG CAC TCT GTC TAG CCG-3′. The reaction was performed in a final volume of 50 μl. The sample reaction contained 1 μl of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase, 5 μl of 10× buffer (20 mm MgSO4), 50 ng of pSCTop-Neu-1 preparation, 125 ng of each oligonucleotide, 10 mm dNTP, and H2O. The reaction was performed using a Mastercycler gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf, Le Pecq, France) and subjected to the following program: denaturation of 30 s at 95 °C, 12 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C and 6 min at 68 °C. The sample was digested by 1 μl of DpnI (10 unit/μl) for 3 h at 37 °C and chemically transformed into the XL1 Blue strain. Cells were applied on a LB agar plate containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The obtained clones were sequenced (IBMP, Strasbourg). The plasmid was then concentrated and purified by High Speed Maxi Prep kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France).Fibroblast Culture and Treatments—Human skin fibroblast strains were established from explants of human adult skin biopsies obtained from informed healthy volunteers (aged 21–49 years). Cells were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1 g/liter of glucose, glutamax I and pyruvate, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and in the presence of 5% CO2. Cells at subcultures 4 to 8 were used. For experiments, fibroblasts were grown to subconfluence in medium containing 10% FCS. Before stimulation, cells were incubated for 18 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FCS, washed twice with PBS, and incubated in serum-free DMEM with or without kE or Neu5Ac for the indicated times. The neuraminidase and serine protease inhibitors, 2,3-dehydro-2-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (ddNeu5Ac) and aprotinin or PMSF respectively, were incubated for 1 h before stimulation, whereas lactose (EBP antagonist) was incubated for 3 h. Inhibitors and antagonists were present in the cell culture media during the stimulation. Cell stimulation was stopped by adding ice-cold PBS containing 50 μm Na3VO4.Measurement of Sialidase Activity at the Plasma Membrane of Fibroblasts—We used the protocol described by Lukong et al. (27Lukong K.E. Seyrantepe V. Landry K. Trudel S. Ahmad A. Gahl W.A. Lefrancois S. Morales C.R. Pshezhetsky A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46172-46181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The cells were seeded in 6-well culture dishes and washed several times with prewarmed PBS. They were then incubated in 1 ml of reaction buffer containing 20 mm CH3COONa, pH 6.5, 0.4 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-α-d-neuraminic acid (Muf-NANA) with or without kE, in the absence or presence of ddNeu5Ac or lactose. After incubation, 400-μl aliquots of medium were added to 3.6 ml of 0.4 m glycine buffer (pH 10.4), and the fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone product released in the medium was quantitated by exciting its fluorescence at 365 nm and recording its intensity at 445 nm.Western Blotting—106 fibroblasts or COS-7 cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS containing 50 μm Na3VO4, scrapped, and sonicated in lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 80 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce; distributed by Interchim, Montluçon, France). Equal amounts of proteins were heated for 5 min at 100 °C in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were placed in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20)) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1000), anti-Neu-1 (1:500), or anti-β-actin (1:5000) antibodies. After five washings with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:4,000 and 1:10,000 in blocking buffer, respectively).For detection of pro-MMP-1, the culture media of fibroblasts were harvested and centrifuged (500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were then concentrated using Microcon YM10 (Millipore, Molsheim, France) and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted as described above using the anti-human MMP-1 antibody (1:500) and a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-sheep antibody (1:10,000). Immunocomplexes were detected by chemiluminescence. Blots were quantitated by densitometry using the PhosphorAnalyst software (Bio-Rad, Marne-la-Vallée, France).Luciferase Assay of MMP-1 Promoter Activity—COS-7 cells were grown on 96-well plates to 80% of confluency (16,000 cells) in DMEM containing 4,5 g/liter of glucose, glutamax I, and pyruvate, supplemented with 10% FCS and in the presence of 5% CO2. For transfection experiments they were incubated for 24 h in serum-free DMEM then with a mixture of Lipofectamine 2000 and DNA plasmids during 4 h. The ratio used was 0.2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 for 0,2 μg of total plasmidic DNA divided in 50% of pSCTop-Neu-1-G68V (or the corresponding empty vector) and 50% of –512ColA-luc plasmid. This proportion was used for 100 μl of DMEM per well. Cells were then incubated with or without kE (150 μg/ml) for 16 h. Elastin peptides stimulation was stopped and 100 μl of SteadyLite reporter lysis buffer were then added (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luciferase activities were measured with the PerkinElmer TopCount microplate counter.Neu-1 siRNA Gene Silencing—COS-7 cells were grown on 6-well plates to 70% confluency in DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter of glucose, glutamax I, and pyruvate, supplemented with 10% FCS and in the presence of 5% CO2. For siRNA transfection, we used the silencer predesigned Neu-1 siRNA from Ambion, (ID: 8481), as they are very effective Neu-1 siRNA (38Liang F. Seyrantepe V. Landry K. Ahmad R. Ahmad A.

After two PBS washes, cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free DMEM with a mixture of Lipofectamine 2000 (5 μl) and Neu-1 or negative control siRNA (100 pmol). Cells were then washed twice with PBS then stimulated for the indicated time with kE. Cell stimulation was stopped by adding ice-cold PBS containing 50 μm Na3VO4 and ERK1/2 Western blots were conducted as described above.Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed in triplicate. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparison between groups were made using Student's t test. The results were considered significantly different at p < 0.05.RESULTSEBP is required for elastin peptide signaling and it has been suggested that tropoelastin recruit EBP to the cell surface where the PPCA and Neu-1 reside thereby leading to the completion of the elastin receptor complex.In the lysosome, Neu-1 activity is highly dependent on the full association of the β-Gal/PPCA/Neu-1 complex. Indeed, it has been shown that the association of PPCA to Neu-1 only results in a weak activity of the sialidase but that the addition of β-Gal to this assembly achieves its full activation.By analogy to what is observed in the lysosome, we supposed that elastin peptide-driven recruitment of EBP to the membrane-bound PPCA/Neu-1 complex could stimulate the enzymatic activities of these sub-units and contribute to signal processing by the elastin receptor. As EBP is devoid of enzymatic activity, we analyzed the possible importance of PPCA and Neu-1 activities on elastin peptide signaling by the elastin receptor complex.Inhibition of PPCA and Neu-1 Activities and Impact on Signaling by the Elastin Receptor Complex—In a previous work, we have shown that the treatment of human skin fibroblasts with elastin peptides resulted in the accumulation of pro-collagenase-1 (pro-MMP-1) in the culture medium (34Duca L. Debelle L. Debret R. Antonicelli F. Hornebeck W. Haye B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and that this effect was strictly mediated by ERK1/2 signaling (35Duca L. Lambert E. Debret R. Rothhut B. Blanchevoye C. Delacoux F. Hornebeck W. Martiny L. Debelle L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As a consequence, we have analyzed the influence of PPCA and Neu-1 inhibition on pro-MMP-1 accumulation and on ERK activation.When cultured fibroblasts were treated with aprotinin, an inhibitor of serine protease, and further stimulated with kE, we observed that PPCA inhibition did not prevent pro-MMP-1 accumulation in the medium following kE treatment (Fig. 1A) nor ERK1/2 induction (Fig. 1B). These results were confirmed using PMSF (Figs. 1, C and D) which is an efficient PPCA inhibitor (39Itoh K. Takiyama N. Kase R. Kondoh K. Sano A. Oshima A. Sakuraba H. Suzuki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1180-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, we concluded that PPCA enzymatic activity was not required for proper signaling by the elastin complex receptor.However, when the cells were treated with elastin peptides in the presence of 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (ddNeu5Ac), a sialidase inhibitor (30Hinek A. Pshezhetsky A.V. von Itzstein M. Starcher B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3698-3710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 40Usuki S. Hoops P. Sweeley C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10595-10599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pro-MMP-1 accumulation in the culture medium was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). As at 400 μm ddNeu5Ac, the effect of elastin peptides on pro-MMP-1 production was almost totally blocked, we decided to further use this experimental concentration. In the presence of ddNeu5Ac, elastin peptide-treated cells have lost their ability to activate ERK1/2 (Fig. 2B). Indeed, ERK1/2 phosphorylation level in the presence of both the inhibitor and kE is comparable to that of the control in the absence of kE stimulation. These results strongly suggested that a sialidase activity was required for elastin peptide signaling. However, we could not precisely determine which enzyme was involved as ddNeu5Ac is not specific of a sialidase form. As a consequence, we could not link this activity to that of the elastin receptor complex.FIGURE 2Influence of elastin peptide treatment on pro-MMP-1 production and ERK activation in the presence of ddNeu5Ac. A, Western blots analysis of pro-MMP-1 production. Cells were pretreated for 1 h with various doses of ddNeu5Ac then stimulated for 24 h with kE (50 μg/ml). Only the nonglycosylated (53 kDa) form of pro-MMP-1 is detected (see Fig. 1 legend). B, Western blot analysis of cellular extracts. Cells were pretreated with 400 μm ddNeu5Ac prior to stimulation (50 μg kE/ml; 30 min). Membranes were probed with anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies. To demonstrate equal loading, blots were stripped and reprobed with an anti-β-actin antibody. Blots are representative of three independent experiments with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of Sialidase Activity at the Cell Surface of Fibroblast in Culture—The Muf-NANA compound is a neuraminidase substrate, which becomes fluorescent when it is cleaved by the enzyme.

We analyzed paired blood and primary tumor samples from 22 children with high-risk neuroblastoma for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and DNA copy number change using the Affymetrix 10K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array.Multiple areas of LOH and copy number gain were seen. The most commonly observed area of LOH was on chromosome arm 11q (15/22 samples; 68%). Chromosome 11q LOH was highly associated with occurrence of chromosome 3p LOH: 9 of the 15 samples with 11q LOH had concomitant 3p LOH (P = 0.016). Chromosome 1p LOH was seen in one-third of cases. LOH events on chromosomes 11q and 1p were generally accompanied by copy number loss, indicating hemizygous deletion within these regions. The one exception was on chromosome 11p, where LOH in all four cases was accompanied by normal copy number or diploidy, implying uniparental disomy. Gain of copy number was most frequently observed on chromosome arm 17q (21/22 samples; 95%) and was associated with allelic imbalance in six samples. Amplification of MYCN was also noted, and also amplification of a second gene, ALK, in a single case.This analysis demonstrates the power of SNP arrays for high-resolution determination of LOH and DNA copy number change in neuroblastoma, a tumor in which specific allelic changes drive clinical outcome and selection of therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2054060430,"We report a role for Nogo receptors (NgRs) in macrophage efflux from sites of inflammation in peripheral nerve. Increasing numbers of macrophages in crushed rat sciatic nerves express NgR1 and NgR2 on the cell surface in the first week after injury. These macrophages show reduced binding to myelin and MAG in vitro, which is reversed by NgR siRNA knockdown and by inhibiting Rho-associated kinase. Fourteen days after sciatic nerve crush, regenerating nerves with newly synthesized myelin have fewer macrophages than cut/ligated nerves that lack axons and myelin. Almost all macrophages in the cut/ligated nerves lie within the Schwann cell basal lamina, while in the crushed regenerating nerves the majority migrate out. Furthermore, crush-injured nerves of NgR1- and MAG-deficient mice and Y-27632-treated rats show impaired macrophage efflux from Schwann cell basal lamina containing myelinated axons. These data have implications for the resolution of inflammation in peripheral nerve and CNS pathologies."

The pathological hallmark of HD is the intraneuronal nuclear protein aggregates of mutant huntingtin. We determined how to enhance UPS function and influence catalytic protein degradation and cell survival in HD. Proteasome activators involved in either the ubiquitinated or the non-ubiquitinated proteolysis were overexpressed in HD patients' skin fibroblasts or mutant huntingtin-expressing striatal neurons. Following compromise of the UPS, overexpression of the proteasome activator subunit PA28gamma, but not subunit S5a, recovered proteasome function in the HD cells. PA28gamma also improved cell viability in mutant huntingtin-expressing striatal neurons exposed to pathological stressors, such as the excitotoxin quinolinic acid and the reversible proteasome inhibitor MG132. These results demonstrate the specific functional enhancements of the UPS that can provide neuroprotection in HD cells."
https://openalex.org/W2137387976,"Genetic disorders of homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism or a high-methionine diet lead to elevations of plasma Hcy levels. In humans, severe genetic hyperhomocysteinemia results in premature death from vascular complications whereas dietary hyperhomocysteinemia is often used to induce atherosclerosis in animal models. Hcy is mistakenly selected in place of methionine by methionyl-tRNA synthetase during protein biosynthesis, which results in the formation of Hcy-thiolactone and initiates a pathophysiological pathway that has been implicated in human vascular disease. However, whether genetic deficiencies in Hcy metabolism or a high-methionine diet affect Hcy-thiolactone levels in mammals has been unknown. Here we show that plasma Hcy-thiolactone is elevated 59-fold and 72-fold in human patients with hyperhomocysteinemia secondary to mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and cystathionine beta-synthase genes, respectively. We also show that mice, like humans, eliminate Hcy-thiolactone by urinary excretion; in contrast to humans, however, mice also eliminate significant amounts of plasma total Hcy (approximately 38%) by urinary excretion. In mice, hyperhomocysteinemia secondary to a high-methionine diet leads to 3.7-fold and 25-fold increases in plasma and urinary Hcy-thiolactone levels, respectively. Thus, we conclude that hyperhomocysteinemia leads to significant increases in the atherogenic metabolite Hcy-thiolactone in humans and mice."

These physiological effects are due to the substitution of Lys for Glu-487 that reduces the kcat for these processes and increases the Km for NAD+, as compared with ALDH2. In this study, we sought to understand the nature of the interactions that give rise to the loss of structural integrity and low activity in ALDH2*2 even when complexed with coenzyme. Consequently, we have solved the crystal structure of ALDH2*2 complexed with coenzyme to 2.5Å. We have also solved the structures of a mutated form of ALDH2 where Arg-475 is replaced by Gln (R475Q). The structural and functional properties of the R475Q enzyme are intermediate between those of wild-type and the ALDH2*2 enzymes. In both cases, the binding of coenzyme restores most of the structural deficits observed in the apoenzyme structures. The binding of coenzyme to the R475Q enzyme restores its structure and catalytic properties to near wild-type levels. In contrast, the disordered helix within the coenzyme binding pocket of ALDH2*2 is reordered, but the active site is only partially reordered. Consistent with the structural data, ALDH2*2 showed a concentration-dependent increase in esterase activity and nitroglycerin reductase activity upon addition of coenzyme, but the levels of activity do not approach those of the wild-type enzyme or that of the R475Q enzyme. The data presented shows that Glu-487 maintains a critical function in linking the structure of the coenzymebinding site to that of the active site through its interactions with Arg-264 and Arg-475, and in doing so, creates the stable structural scaffold conducive to catalysis. The common mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) ALDH2*2 polymorphism is associated with impaired ethanol metabolism and decreased efficacy of nitroglycerin treatment.

In both cases, the binding of coenzyme restores most of the structural deficits observed in the apoenzyme structures. The binding of coenzyme to the R475Q enzyme restores its structure and catalytic properties to near wild-type levels. In contrast, the disordered helix within the coenzyme binding pocket of ALDH2*2 is reordered, but the active site is only partially reordered. Consistent with the structural data, ALDH2*2 showed a concentration-dependent increase in esterase activity and nitroglycerin reductase activity upon addition of coenzyme, but the levels of activity do not approach those of the wild-type enzyme or that of the R475Q enzyme. The data presented shows that Glu-487 maintains a critical function in linking the structure of the coenzymebinding site to that of the active site through its interactions with Arg-264 and Arg-475, and in doing so, creates the stable structural scaffold conducive to catalysis. Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) 3The abbreviations used are: ALDH2, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase; ALDH2*2, semidominant polymorphism of ALDH2; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide portion of NAD+; ACES, N-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: ALDH2, mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase; ALDH2*2, semidominant polymorphism of ALDH2; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide portion of NAD+; ACES, N-(2-acetamido)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid. is most commonly associated with its role in ethanol metabolism, catalyzing the oxidation of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde to acetate (Table 1) (1Hurley T.D. Edenberg H.J. Li T.K. Licinio J. Wong M. Pharmacogenomics: The Search for Individualized Therapies. Culinary and Hospitality Industry Publications Services, Weinheim, Germany2002: 417-441Crossref Google Scholar). Approximately 40% of the East Asian population has a semi-dominant polymorphism of ALDH2, ALDH2*2, which is essentially inactive in vivo (2Seitz H.K. Matsuzaki S. Yokoyama A. Homann N. Vakevainen S. Wang X.D. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2001; 25: 137S-143SCrossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Those individuals who carry the gene for ALDH2*2 experience a disulfiram-like reaction to ethanol consumption, with a more severe reaction observed in individuals who are homozygous for ALDH2*2 (3Peng G.S. Wang M.F. Chen C.Y. Luu S.U. Chou H.C. Li T.K. Yin S.J. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 463-476PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction, also referred to as the flushing response, is associated with a low occurrence of alcoholism (4Higuchi S. Muramatsu T. Shigemori K. Saito M. Kono H. Dufour M.C. Harford T.C. J. Stud. Alcohol. 1992; 53: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In recent years, another role for ALDH2 has been identified as a bioactivator of nitroglycerin employed in the treatment of angina pectoris (5Chen Z. Zhang J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2002; 99: 8306-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Individuals who are hetero- or homozygous for ALDH2*2 also experience reduced efficacy of nitroglycerin in the treatment of angina (6Li Y. Zhang D. Jin W. Shao C. Yan P. Xu C. Sheng H. Liu Y. Yu J. Xie Y. Zhao Y. Lu D. Nebert D.W. Harrison D.C. Huang W. Jin L. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These studies reveal a correlation between reduced ALDH2 activity and the effectiveness of nitroglycerin.TABLE 1Reactions catalyzed by ALDH2Enzyme FunctionExample reaction equationDehydrogenaseAcetaldehyde + NAD+ + Ered → acetate + NADH + EredEsterasep-Nitrophenyl acetate + Ered → p-nitrophenol + acetate + EredReductaseGTN + Ered → 1,2-GDN + NO2− + Eox Open table in a new tab The low activity of ALDH2*2 is the result of a substitution of lysine for glutamate at position 487 of the 500-amino acid mature enzyme or position 504 of the 517-amino acid precursor protein (7Goedde H.W. Harada S. Agarwal D.P. Hum. Genet. 1979; 51: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This substitution yields an enzyme that exhibits a 200-fold increase in the Km for NAD+ as well as a 10-fold reduced kcat when compared with the wild-type enzyme (8Farres J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The KmNAD+ exceeds the in vivo concentration of the coenzyme by 15-fold, which, combined with the 10-fold lower catalytic rate, is responsible for its severely reduced activity in vivo. In addition to these kinetic changes, the ALDH2*2 enzyme also does not exhibit the same presteady-state burst of NADH production observed for the wild-type enzyme, which is evidence for a change in rate-limiting step from acylenzyme hydrolysis to some step preceding hydride transfer in ALDH2*2 (8Farres J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the wild-type ALDH2, both as apoenzyme and coenzyme-bound forms, and the ALDH2*2 enzyme in the apoenzyme state have been solved (9Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 10Hurley T.D. Steinmetz C.G. Weiner H. Adv. Exp. Med.

Chem. 2005; 280: 30550-30556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In every case the enzymes are tetramers of four identical subunits. The arrangement of the subunits displays 222 symmetry where one of the 2-fold axes conceptually divides the enzyme into dimer pairs, and the subunit interface within a dimer pair is distinct from that between dimers. Each subunit in the tetramer is comprised of three domains: the catalytic domain, the coenzyme-binding domain, and the oligomerization domain. The latter of which is important for both dimer and tetramer formation. Like all other known structures of ALDH family members, the binding of coenzyme to the enzyme does not elicit any large conformational changes in the protein structure. However, when bound to ALDH2 the coenzyme is observed to adopt one of two conformations, termed the “hydride transfer” and “hydrolysis” conformations (12Moore S.A. Baker H.M. Blythe T.J. Kitson K.E. Kitson T.M. Baker E.N. Structure. 1998; 6: 1541-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 13Perez-Miller S. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Hammen P.K. Allali-Hassani A. Hallenga K. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7156-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The hydride transfer conformation is characterized by the nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) portion being extended toward the catalytic nucleophile, Cys-302. Whereas, the hydrolysis conformation is distinguished by a more contracted NMN, which allows room for the hydrolysis of the acylenzyme intermediate (12Moore S.A. Baker H.M. Blythe T.J. Kitson K.E. Kitson T.M. Baker E.N. Structure. 1998; 6: 1541-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 13Perez-Miller S. Hurley T.D.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7156-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Magnesium appears to selectively stabilize both conformations through interactions across the pyrophosphate oxygen atoms, and its presence in enzyme assays increases the Vmax of ALDH2 (13Perez-Miller S. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15Ho K.K. Allali-Hassani A. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8022-8029Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When bound to ALDH, the adenosine portion of NAD+ is nestled between the αF and αG helices within the NAD+-binding pocket. The αG helix is situated at the dimer interface and interacts with the same helix across the interface (Fig. 1). In wild-type ALDH2, Glu-487 forms hydrogen bonds with Arg-264 and Arg-475. Arg-264 lies C-terminal to the αG helix and is the first residue in the last β-strand (β11) of the coenzyme domain. Arg-475 is located within a loop in the opposing subunit. These interactions help to stabilize the dimer interface and maintain the integrity of both the NAD+-binding cleft and the floor of the active site (9Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In the ALDH2*2 apoenzyme, the presence of a lysine at residue 487 disturbs these stabilizing hydrogen bonds and leads to disorder in the αG helix and the loop that includes Arg-475. The loss of these interactions severely compromises the structure of the NAD+-binding site and repositions or disorders several catalytically important residues (11Larson H.N. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30550-30556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). With the loss of the interactions that stabilize the αG helices at the dimer interface, the coenzyme-binding and catalytic domains rotate away from the interface by 2.5° along an axis that runs between the oligomerization and catalytic domains (11Larson H.N. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30550-30556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The structural perturbations are propagated into the active site region of the opposing subunit and lead to a disordering of the general base Glu-268 as well as Glu-399, a residue that helps to properly position the NMN portion of the coenzyme. We attempted to rescue the ALDH2*2 enzyme by constructing a series of ALDH2 double mutants in which Arg-264 and Arg-475 were separately converted to a glutamine or glutamate in the context of the lysine at 487 (16Wei B. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5295-5302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The corresponding triple mutant was also created. However, none of the additional mutations restored activity to wild-type levels. An unexpected outcome of this study was that substitution of Arg-475 by Glu or Gln in ALDH2*2 resulted in enzymes that exhibited cooperative binding of NAD+. This was also true when the R475Q mutation was introduced in the wild-type enzyme: this R475Q enzyme exhibited a Hill coefficient of 1.8, a K NAD+S more than 20-fold higher than wild-type, and a 2-fold reduction in kcat. Although the R475Q mutation does not completely restore wild-type activity levels in ALDH2*2, the mutation-induced cooperativity may shed light on intersubunit communication that gives rise to the observed dominance of Lys-487 in ALDH2*2/ALDH2 heterotetramers (16Wei B. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5295-5302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Zhou J. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12019-12024Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thermal stability assays of ALDH2 R475Q have demonstrated that this enzyme is less thermally stable than wild-type by ∼15 °C (16Wei B. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5295-5302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of NAD+ was found to increase the thermal stability of the R475Q enzyme, but had little effect on the stability of wild-type enzyme (16Wei B. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5295-5302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To study the role of residues 475 and 487 in the maintenance of structural integrity of the coenzyme-binding and active sites of ALDH2, we have solved the crystal structure of ALDH2*2 with bound coenzyme to 2.5-Å resolution and both the apo and coenzyme-bound structures of the R475Q mutant enzyme to 2.15 and 2.0 Å, respectively. Overall, these structures more closely resemble wild-type ALDH2 rather than the apoenzyme ALDH2*2. In particular, the main chain atoms of the αG helix and the loop that includes position 475 are visible in the electron density maps. The structural deficits introduced by the Gln-475 mutation are similar to those produced by the Lys-487 mutation, but the extent of the structural perturbation is less severe. Whereas binding of NAD+ does reconstitute much of the coenzyme binding site in the ALDH2*2 enzyme, the presence of coenzyme alone cannot completely overcome the effects of lysine at residue 487, which leads to the disordering of Glu-268 and Glu-399, residues essential for catalysis and effective coenzyme positioning, respectively. In contrast, the less severe structural perturbations observed in the R475Q mutant can be corrected through coenzyme binding in one subunit, which induces a reordering of the neighboring subunit and thereby confers the observed cooperativity of coenzyme binding. Thus, the Gln-475 mutant appears to be a structural and functional intermediate between that of the wild-type and ALDH2*2 enzymes. These data show that residues 264, 475, and 487 comprise a key structural cornerstone in ALDH2 that can transduce structural and kinetic information between neighboring subunits and underlies the mechanisms that give rise to both allelic dominance in ALDH2*2 and cooperativity in the R475Q mutant. Materials—Dithiothreitol, DEAE-Sepharose, p-hydroxyacetophenone, guanidine HCl, and ethylene glycol were each purchased from Sigma. ACES, MgCl2, and propionaldehyde were purchased from Aldrich. Bio-Gel P-6 DG and Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent were each obtained from Bio-Rad. Grade I NAD+ was purchased from Roche Diagnostics Corp. PEG 6000 was from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA), and the 24-well sitting drop trays were from Charles Supper Co., Inc. (Natick, MA). Protein Preparation and Crystallization—Human ALDH2 and ALDH2*2 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells using the pT-7-7 expression system previously described (8Farres J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zheng C.F. Wang T.T. Weiner H. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1993; 17: 828-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The R475Q mutation was introduced into the pT-7-7 expression system as previously published (16Wei B. Ni L. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5295-5302Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). E268Q and C302S mutant expression vectors were prepared as published (13Perez-Miller S. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). All enzymes were purified according to the established procedure (8Farres J. Wang X. Takahashi K. Cunningham S.J. Wang T.T. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Larson H.N. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30550-30556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Perez-Miller S. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), concentrated in an Amicon stirred cell, and either flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80 °C (ALDH2*2) or stored in 50% glycerol at -20 °C (all others). Purification was monitored at 340 nm using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer by following the aldehyde oxidation activity reaction at 25 °C in 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 9.5, containing 10 mm NAD+ and 200 μm propionaldehyde. To prepare ALDH2*2 for crystallization, the protein was removed from -80 °C, thawed, and diluted from 8.4 to 7.5 mg/ml with 10 mm ACES buffer, pH 6.6. To prepare ALDH2 R475Q for crystallization, protein was buffer exchanged on a P-6 DG column into 10 mm ACES buffer, pH 6.6. Protein was then concentrated in a YM-30 Amicon Centricon filter device to 8.0 and 7.8 mg/ml for the low and high resolution apoenzyme structures, respectively. For the NAD+-bound ALDH2 R475Q enzyme, protein was utilized directly from purification, not stored on glycerol or frozen, and concentrated to 7.9 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Sitting drop trays for crystallization were prepared as described (11Larson H.N. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30550-30556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and contained the following components: 100 mm ACES, pH 6.6-6.8, 5-10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm guanidine HCl, 15% (w/v) PEG 6000, and 4-8 mm dithiothreitol. The equilibrium drop volume was 3 μl. Trays were stored at 20 °C and crystals were harvested at 14-22 days. Coenzyme was introduced into apoenzyme ALDH2*2 crystals through a two-step soaking procedure. Crystals were soaked for 10 min in mother liquor containing 35 mm NAD+ followed by a second 10-min soak in mother liquor containing 70 mm NAD+. Coenzyme was introduced into apoenzyme ALDH2 R475Q crystals through a 2-h soak in mother liquor containing 10 mm NAD+. Cryoprotection of the crystals was accomplished using a rapid two-step procedure to introduce 19-22% ethylene glycol cryoprotectant. The crystals were immediately flash frozen at 100 K in a N2 cryostream. Data Collection, Processing, and Model Refinement for the NAD+-bound ALDH2*2 Structure—Data were collected at the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley, CA) on the Molecular Biology Consortium beamline 4.2.2. The beamline was equipped with a NOIR-1 CCD detector, and the x-ray beam wavelength for data collection was 1.072 Å (11,564 KeV). Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the D*TREK program suite (19Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). The human wild-type apoenzyme ALDH2 structure served as the starting model (20Hurley T. Perez-Miller S. Breen H. Enzymol. Mol. Biol. Carbonyl Metabolism. 2001; 130-132: 3-14Google Scholar) following its placement into the P1 cell through alignment of the wild-type coordinates with the three ALDH2*2 tetramers in the asymmetric unit (21Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar, 22Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). These coordinates were then used directly for refinement. This model was refined using the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) suite (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Model rebuilding was performed using σA-weighted electron density maps viewed through the program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). To verify placement of cofactor and reordered sections of the protein, simulated annealing omit maps were generated by excluding all cofactor molecules as well as all residues not included in the coordinates for apoenzyme ALDH2*2 (11Larson H.N. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30550-30556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Rfree was evaluated using a randomly chosen 5% of the crystallographic data. Data Collection, Processing, and Model Refinement for ALDH2 R475Q Structures—The apoenzyme 2.75 Å and 2.15 Å data were collected on a Rigaku Raxis IIC instrument and at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source BioCars beamline 14-BM-C, respectively. NAD+-bound enzyme data constitute a merged data set where lower resolution (30-2.5 Å) data were collected on an Raxis IIC instrument, and higher resolution data (25-2.0 Å) were collected at beamline X26C at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratories. Data collection wavelengths, detectors, and data reduction software are summarized in Table 1. Data were reduced using the HKL program suite (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Phases were solved using the molecular replacement method and wild-type apoenzyme as the starting model for apoenzyme. The 2.75-Å apoenzyme R475Q structure served as the starting model for the NAD+-bound enzyme. Molecular replacement was executed using the program AMoRe as implemented in the CCP4 program package (21Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar, 26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). The resulting models were refined using the Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) suite (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The 2.15-Å apoenzyme structure proved to be pseudo-merohedrally twinned, therefore, the program Shelx was utilized for refinement of this structure (27Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). Rfree was evaluated using a randomly chosen 5% of the crystallographic data (low resolution apoenzyme and NAD+-bound enzyme). For the twinned structure, 5% of the data were chosen by thin shells for inclusion in the test reflection set. Model rebuilding was performed using σA-weighted electron density maps viewed through the program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Structure Analysis—Tetramer, subunit, and domain alignments were performed using the program LSQKAB as implemented in the CCP4 package (21Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar, 22Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Root mean square deviations were calculated for the Cα atoms present in each alignment. Residues 244-271, 424-425, and 463-478 were omitted for all pairings with apoenzyme ALDH2*2 (Protein Data Bank ID 1ZUM). In alignments with wild-type ALDH2, NADH-bound ALDH2 (PDB ID 1O02) and apoenzyme ALDH2 (PDB ID 1O05) were used (13Perez-Miller S. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Hurley T. Perez-Miller S. Breen H. Enzymol. Mol. Biol. Carbonyl Metabolism. 2001; 130-132: 3-14Google Scholar). To determine the extent of domain reorientation relative to apoenzyme ALDH2*2 and wild-type enzyme, the point of reference was established as the cofactor-binding domain. This domain was aligned to either apoenzyme wild type, NAD+-bound wild type, or apoenzyme ALDH2*2. The rotated ALDH2*2 subunit was then realigned to the compared molecule using either the catalytic or oligomerization domain. The extent of domain rotation is therefore expressed as the amount of rotation that is necessary to align the domain of interest relative to the common positions of the coenzyme-binding domains. Esterase Activity Assays—The esterase activities of ALDH2 and ALDH2*2 were determined by monitoring the rate of p-nitrophenol formation at 400 nm in 25 mm BES, pH 7.5, with 800 μm p-nitrophenyl acetate as the substrate at room temperature in the absence or presence of added NAD+ (15Ho K.K. Allali-Hassani A. Hurley T.D. Weiner H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8022-8029Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A pH-dependent molar extinction coefficient of 16 mm-1 cm-1 at 400 nm for nitrophenol was used. The concentration of NAD+ was determined by using a molar extinction coefficient of 18 m-1 cm-1 at 260 nm. Nitroglycerin Activity Assays—Purified ALDH2 enzyme (1-2 μg) and ALDH2 mutants (50-100 μg) were incubated for 5-10 min at 37 °C with 1 μm nitroglycerin in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0-20 mm NAD+. After incubation, the reactions were stopped. Extraction and analysis of nitroglycerin and 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate were performed as previously described (5Chen Z. Zhang J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2002; 99: 8306-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). NAD+ was introduced into the ALDH2*2 crystals through a two-step soaking procedure, after which the crystal diffracted to 2.5 Å. The resulting data has been refined to an Rfree of 0.27 and Rwork of 0.23. Like apo-ALDH2*2, and wild-type ALDH2, NAD+-bound ALDH2*2 is a tetramer of four identical sub-units, and three independent copies of the tetramer comprise the asymmetric unit. The lower resolution of the coenzymebound structure as compared with the apoenzyme structure (2 Å) is due to the fact that only smaller crystals of apo-ALDH2*2 survived the soaking process, and the data were collected at beamline 4.2.2 located at the Advance Light Source, which has a slightly lower flux than beamline 19-ID located at APS, where the apoenzyme data were collected. Two independent structures of the apoenzyme form of the R475Q mutant were determined from differing space groups. Nearly all forms of ALDH2 crystallize in two related, but distinct space groups: P21 and P212121. Both crystal forms have similar morphology and generally diffract to similar limits of resolution. The P21 crystals exhibit pseudo-C2221 symmetry in which the cell dimensions are similar to the primitive orthorhombic setting. However, ∼50% of all P21 crystals are pseudo-merohedrally twinned, necessitating special treatment of the data during refinement. In the case of the apoenzyme form of the R475Q mutant, we were unable to obtain data of comparable resolution to the coenzyme-bound structure (2 Å, Rfree and Rwork of 0.24 and 0.20, respectively) except from pseudo-merohedrally twinned crystals. Therefore, we have included both the 2.15-Å pseudomerohedrally twinned structure refined to an Rfree and Rwork of 0.31 and 0.25, respectively, and the 2.75-Å orthorhombic structure refined to an Rfree and Rwork of 0.27 and 0.23, respectively, because the structures provide supportive and complementary information.

https://openalex.org/W1563525459,"Anchorage-independent growth is a hallmark of tumor growth and results from enhanced proliferation and altered cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. By using gene-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we showed for the first time that NHERF1/EBP50 (Na/H exchanger regulator factor 1/ezrin-radixin-moesin binding phosphoprotein 50), an adapter protein with membrane localization under physiological conditions, inhibits cell motility and is required to suppress anchorage-independent growth. Both NHERF1 PDZ domains are necessary for the tumor suppressor effect. NHERF1 associates directly through the PDZ2 domain with beta-catenin and is required for beta-catenin localization at the cell-cell junctions in MEFs. Mechanistically, the absence of NHERF1 selectively decreased the interaction of beta-catenin with E-cadherin, but not with N-cadherin. The ensuing disorganization of E-cadherin-mediated adherens junctions as well as the observed moderate increase in beta-catenin transcriptional activity contributed most likely to the anchorage-independent growth of NHERF1-deficient MEFs. In vivo, NHERF1 is specifically localized at the apical brush-border membrane in intestinal epithelial cells and is required to maintain a fraction of the cortical beta-catenin at this level. Thus, NHERF1 emerges as a cofactor essential for the integrity of epithelial tissues by maintaining the proper localization and complex assembly of beta-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2157101941,"Inflammation in the tumor bed can either promote or inhibit tumor growth. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha is a central transcriptional suppressor of inflammation, and may therefore modulate tumor growth. Here we show that PPARalpha deficiency in the host leads to overt inflammation that suppresses angiogenesis via excess production of the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 and prevents tumor growth. Bone marrow transplantation and granulocyte depletion show that PPARalpha expressing granulocytes are necessary for tumor growth. Neutralization of thrombospondin-1 restores tumor growth in PPARalpha-deficient mice. These findings suggest that the absence of PPARalpha activity renders inflammatory infiltrates tumor suppressive and, thus, may provide a target for inhibiting tumor growth by modulating stromal processes, such as angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2054084446,"Gene silencing via CpG island methylation in the promoter region is one of the mechanisms by which tumor suppressor genes are inactivated in human cancers. Previous studies have shown that the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-2 gene, which is an endogenous inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases involved in cell invasion and tumorigenesis, is downregulated or silenced in a variety of human cancer cell lines. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying TIMP-2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and primary prostate tumor samples. We observed a strong correlation between promoter hypermethylation and lost expression of TIMP-2 gene, which was supported by other results demonstrating that promoter demethylation by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A reactivated TIMP-2 and restored its expression in TIMP-2-silenced metastatic prostate cell lines. These results were further substantiated by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, showing the preferential binding of MeCP2 to methylated CpG island in TIMP-2-silenced metastatic prostate cell lines. In vitro Matrigel invasion assays showed that re-expression of TIMP-2 after a combined treatment with 5-aza and trichostatin-A in metastatic prostate cells resulted in a significant reduction of tumor cell invasion. Furthermore, CpG methylation of TIMP-2 promoter was also shown in primary prostate tumors that expressed decreased TIMP-2 protein levels. These results suggest that the downregulation of the TIMP-2 gene is associated with promoter methylation and that this may play an important role in prostate cancer progression during the invasive and metastatic stages of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1970253192,"Homozygous deletions (HD) provide an important resource for identifying the location of candidate tumor suppressor genes. To identify the tumor suppressor gene in oral cancer, we employed high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-array analysis. We identified a homozygous loss of FAT (4q35), a new member of the human cadherin superfamily, from genome-wide screening of copy number alterations in one primary oral cancer. This result was evaluated by genomic polymerase chain reaction in 13 oral cancer cell lines and 20 primary oral cancers and Southern blot in the cell lines. We found frequent exonic HD of FAT in the cell lines (3/13, 23%) and in primary oral cancers (16/20, 80%). FAT expression was absent in these cell lines. Homozygous deletion hot spots were observed in exon 1 (9/20, 45%) and exon 4 (7/20, 35%). Moreover, loss of gene expression was identified in other types of squamous cell carcinoma. The methylation status of the FAT CpG island in squamous cell carcinomas correlated negatively with its expression. Our results identify mutations in FAT as an important factor in the development of oral cancer and indicate the importance of FATs function in some squamous cell carcinomas."

This mutation shifts the redox potential of QA by ∼–60 mV. This mutant provides an opportunity to test the hypothesis, proposed earlier from herbicide-induced redox effects, that photoinhibition (light-induced damage of the photosynthetic apparatus) is modulated by the potential of QA. Thus the influence of the redox potential of QA on photoinhibition was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Compared with the wild-type, the A249S mutant showed an accelerated photoinhibition and an increase in singlet oxygen production. Measurements of thermoluminescence and of the fluorescence yield decay kinetics indicated that the charge-separated state involving QA was destabilized in the A249S mutant. These findings support the hypothesis that a decrease in the redox potential of QA causes an increase in singlet oxygen-mediated photoinhibition by favoring the back-reaction route that involves formation of the reaction center chlorophyll triplet. The kinetics of charge recombination are interpreted in terms of a dynamic structural heterogeneity in photosystem II that results in high and low potential forms of QA.

Each electron is transferred over a chain of redox cofactors to the terminal plastoquinone QB, which accepts two electrons and two protons (5Diner B.A. Babcock G.T. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer, Dordrecht1996: 213-247Google Scholar). The efficiency of PSII in converting light energy into a charge-separated state is remarkably high (5Diner B.A. Babcock G.T. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer, Dordrecht1996: 213-247Google Scholar). The univalent photochemistry must interface with the four-electron chemistry occurring at the electron donor side with the two-electron chemistry at the acceptor side. This is achieved by different mechanisms. On the donor side, the so-called oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) accumulates four redox equivalents before it extracts four electrons from two water molecules. Accumulation is necessary, because the energy needed to extract the electrons one by one from water requires more driving force than visible light provides (4Britt R.D. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer, Dordrecht1996: 137-164Google Scholar). During the catalytic cycle, the OEC exists in different oxidation states. These are designated S0, S1, S2, S3, and S4, where the subscript indicates the number of accumulated oxidation equivalents. The cycle is completed when the S4 state performs a 4-electron oxidation of water, with the OEC being returned to the most reduced of the so-called S states, S0. The OEC consists of four manganese ions, one calcium ion (3Goussias C. Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the electron acceptor side, electron transfer involves two plastoquinones, the primary and secondary quinone acceptors (QA and QB). Although both are plastoquinones, their physical and chemical properties differ. QA is tightly bound and acts as a one-electron acceptor, with a short-lived semiquinone state that undergoes no observable protonation events during its lifetime (5Diner B.A. Babcock G.T. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer, Dordrecht1996: 213-247Google Scholar). QB, on the other hand, acts as a two-electron and two-proton acceptor with a stable semiquinone intermediate, QB– (5Diner B.A. Babcock G.T. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer, Dordrecht1996: 213-247Google Scholar, 10Bouges-Bocquet B. Biochim. Biophys.

Although the semiquinone state, QB–, is tightly bound, its quinone and quinol forms are exchangeable with the quinone pool in the membrane (12Wraight C.A. Israel J.

PSII is known to be susceptible to damage under high light intensities, a process called photoinhibition. Under physiological conditions the D1 protein of PSII has the highest turnover rate of all the proteins in the cell (14Mattoo A.K. Pick U. Hoffman-Falk H. Edelman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1572-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This is usually assumed to be the result of photodamage mediated by PSII photochemistry (Ref. 15Rutherford A.W. Krieger-Liszkay A.

It has been proposed that during charge recombination reactions, chlorophyll triplet-mediated, singlet oxygen (1O2) is produced and that this is the species responsible for the PSII damage (17Vass I.

Conditions that favor charge recombination reactions (e.g. either high light intensities or excitation by single turnover flashes (23Keren N. Gong H. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 806-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)) induce a decrease in PSII activity. This is due to the fact that under photoinhibitory conditions the D1 protein is damaged and degraded faster than it is replaced (for review see Refs. 24Prasil O. Adir N. Ohad I. Barber J. The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1992: 295-348Crossref Google Scholar and 25Aro E.M. Virgin I. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 113-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Different classes of herbicides induce different rates of photoinhibition. Phenolic herbicides stimulate the process of photoinhibition relative to urea-type herbicides, and under some in vitro conditions urea herbicides appear to afford some protection against photoinhibition relative to the herbicide-free material (26Nakajima Y. Yoshida S. Ono T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 673-680Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Komenda J. Koblizek M. Prasil O. Photosynth.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21246-21252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was explained by the fact that the binding of herbicides influences the midpoint potential of the redox couple QA/QA– (31Krieger-Liszkay A. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17339-17344Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The urea type herbicide DCMU raises the midpoint potential of QA by 50 mV, whereas the phenolic herbicide bromoxynil lowers it by 45 mV (31Krieger-Liszkay A. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17339-17344Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The relationship between the redox potential of QA and photoinhibition was explained in terms of the following model (15Rutherford A.W. Krieger-Liszkay A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 648-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 31Krieger-Liszkay A. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17339-17344Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The back-reaction between the radical pair [P+⋅QA−⋅] and the ground state P occurs via two main pathways: an indirect pathway involving the repopulation of the [P+⋅Pheo−⋅] radical pair and a direct pathway involving direct tunneling to the ground state (Refs. 15Rutherford A.W. Krieger-Liszkay A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 648-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 31Krieger-Liszkay A. Rutherford A.W.

The yields of both pathways are modulated by the difference in the free energy between the [P+⋅QA−⋅] and [P+⋅Pheo−⋅] radical pairs (Refs. 15Rutherford A.W. Krieger-Liszkay A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 648-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 31Krieger-Liszkay A. Rutherford A.W.

If this gap is small, i.e. in the presence of a phenolic herbicide, the back-reaction occurs with a higher yield via the indirect pathway forming a significant yield of 3P. This 3P can then react with 3O2 forming the toxic singlet oxygen species, 1O2. When the energy gap is increased, i.e. in the presence of DCMU, the probability of forming the [P+⋅Pheo−⋅] state is lowered, and the chances are higher that the [P+⋅QA−⋅] radical pair decays via the direct and safe route. EPR-spin trapping experiments supported this model, because the yield of 1O2 formation was significantly lower in the presence of DCMU than in the presence of bromoxynil (22Fufezan C. Rutherford A.W. Krieger-Liszkay A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To study further the influence of the redox potential of QA on the rate of photoinhibition we attempted to change its midpoint potential without using herbicides, thereby avoiding any potential difficulties from possible secondary effects of these chemicals. Thus we created mutants with a single point mutation in the QA binding pocket in Thermosynechococcus elongatus, the thermophilic cyanobacterium from which the structure of PSII was obtained by crystallographic methods (7Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2796) Google Scholar, 34Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 438: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). One such mutant was used to study the influence of the midpoint potential of QA on charge recombination reactions and on photoinhibition. The results provide independent support (in the absence of herbicides) for the relationship between the redox potential and photoinhibition, and hence for the charge recombination model. In addition this study gives new mechanistic insights concerning the presence of a dynamic structural heterogeneity around the QA site and how this influences the redox potential. Strain and Standard Culture Conditions—T. elongatus cells were grown in a rotary shaker (120 rpm) at 45 °C under continuous illumination from fluorescent white lamps giving an intensity of ∼80 microeinstein m–2 s–1. Cells were grown in a DTN micro Einstein medium (35Roncel M. Boussac A. Zurita J.L. Bottin H. Sugiura M. Kirilovsky D. Ortega J.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in an enriched CO2 atmosphere and in a 3-liter Erlenmeyer flask (1.5-liter culture). Cells were grown in the presence of spectinomycin (25 μgml–1) and streptomycin (10 μg ml–1). Mutant strains were grown additionally in the presence of the antibiotic kanamycin (40 μgml–1). Plasmids, in Vitro Mutagenesis, and Transformation of T. elongatus Cells—Site-directed mutations were performed using the Qiagen site-directed mutagenesis kit on the plasmid pUC18–43H (provided by Dr. M. Sugiura, see Ref. 36Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The pUC18-CP43H plasmid consists of the coding region for psbD1 and psbC (gene product CP43), with a sequence coding for His6 tag and the kanamycin resistance cassette. The construct is surrounded by the non-coding region of the psbD1 and psbC to provide a higher target sequence for the homologous recombination. The primers used to insert the point mutation in the pUC18-CP43H plasmid that resulted in the A249S mutation were 5′-GAA GAG ACC TAC TCG ATG GTG ACG AGT AAC CGG TTT TGG AGC CAA-3′ and its complementary strand. The A249S mutation was introduced by changing GCG to AGT (bold). Additionally, a conservative point mutation was introduced into the third position of the codon for Arg-251, changing CGT to CGG (underlined). Together these modifications introduced a new AgeI restriction site, which was used for fast screening of potential successfully transformed clones. Amplification of the mutated pUC18-H43 plasmid was done in Escherichia coli. The plasmid was purified and used to transform a strain of T. elongatus lacking the psbD2 gene by electroporation (provided by Dr. M. Sugiura, see Ref. 36Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The psbD2 gene codes the second copy of D2. We will further refer to the ΔpsbD2 strain as WT′. The transformation was done as described in Kirilovsky et al. (37Kirilovsky D. Roncel M. Boussac A. Wilson A. Zurita J.L. Ducruet J.M. Bottin H. Sugiura M. Ortega J.M. Rutherford A.W. J. Biol.

The preparations used in this work had an oxygen evolution activity of 2.2–3 mmol of O2 (mg of Chl)–1 h–1. Oxygen Evolution Measurements—Oxygen evolution was measured at 25 °C by polarography using a Clark-type oxygen electrode with saturating white light. Oxygen evolution in cells (10 μg of Chl.ml–1), thylakoid membranes (10 μg of Chl.ml–1), and PSII core complexes (5 μg of Chl.ml–1) was measured in 40 mm MES, pH 6.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 m glycinebetaine, and in the presence of 0.5 mm 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (dissolved in ethanol) as electron acceptor.

Bot. 2003; 54: 2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in a 40 mm MES (pH 6.5) buffer containing 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, at a Chl concentration of 100 μgml–1. After dark adaptation (15 min) the cells were frozen to –80 °C in darkness and were maintained at that temperature for 30 min. After slow thawing, the cell suspension was incubated on ice in darkness. PSII complexes were measured at a concentration of 35 μg of Chl.ml–1. The particles were kept in complete darkness (for at least 30 min). To measure the thermoluminescence originating from the S2/3QB– charge recombination (B-Band) (40Rutherford A.W. Crofts A.R. Inoue Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 457-465Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar) the samples were incubated for 5 min in the dark at 40 °C and then flashed once or twice at 1 °C. To measure the thermoluminescence originating from the S2QA– recombination (Q-Band), the dark-adapted samples were flashed once and incubated with either 20 μm DCMU or 100 μm bromoxynil or without any additions at 40 °C for 3 min. After this pre-treatment T. elongatus cells were cooled down to –5 °C and flashed. Although one flash should be sufficient to introduce the charge-separated state in most of the reaction centers two flashes were needed in T. elongatus to obtain the largest Q band. This may reflect a large concentration of QB– in darkness (41Fufezan C. Zhang C. Krieger-Liszkay A. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12780-12789Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that results in incomplete DCMU binding under the conditions of the experiment. For luminescence detection the samples were warmed at a constant rate (0.5 °C s–1) from 1 °C or –5 °C to 80 °C. When TL was measured in PSII cores the sample concentration was adjusted based on the amplitude of stable EPR signal TyrD·. Singlet Oxygen Measurements—Spin-trapping assays were performed in PSII particles at a concentration of 10 μg of Chl.ml–1. Samples were illuminated for up to 60 min with 1.5 millieinstein m–2 s–1 red light in the presence of 10 mm 2,2,6,6-tetramethyliperidine (TEMP), 4% (v/v) methanol, and buffer (40 mm MES, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5). If 1O2 is produced, it can react with TEMP and forms thereby the stable nitroxyl radical TEMPO, the amount of which is linearly correlated to the unsaturated EPR signal. To compare the rate of singlet oxygen production in different preparations from different batches, the signal sizes were normalized. This was done by calculating a factor between the size of the dark signal and the signal after 30- and 60-min illumination, respectively. In control experiments, the EPR signal present immediately after mixing the spin trap with PSII did not change its amplitude upon incubation in the dark for 60 min. EPR signals in dark controls result from impurities in the spin trap. X-band spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Bruker ESP 200 spectrometer at 9.7-GHz microwave frequency, 63-milliwatt microwave power, 100-kHz modulation frequency, and a modulation amplitude of 2 Gauss. Photoinhibition Assays in Vitro and in Vivo—Photoinhibition experiments in vivo were performed with a Chl concentration of 10 μg of Chl.ml–1. Cells were incubated at 30 °C in the presence of 34 μgml–1 chloramphenicol in a glass tube (3-cm diameter) while being stirred and with illumination from 3 Atralux spots of 150 watts (1 millieinstein m–2 s–1 each lamp). The effective light intensity encountered by each cell was diminished by approximately half due to the vessel used. For the photoinhibition experiments in vitro, PSII complexes were illuminated in a modulated fluorometer (PAM; Walz, Effelrich, Germany) adapted to a Hansatech oxygen electrode as previously described (42El Bissati K. Delphin E. Murata N. Etienne A. Kirilovsky D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All the experiments were carried out in a stirred cuvette of 1-cm diameter (32 °C) at a chlorophyll concentration of 3 μg of Chl.ml–1. The decrease of the yield of chlorophyll fluorescence was monitored in the modulated fluorometer during illumination with white light at 1.5 millieinstein m–2 s–1. Redox Titrations of QA Using Fluorescence Yield—Redox titrations were performed as described by Krieger et al. (43Krieger A. Rutherford A.W. Johnson G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 193-201Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted to a concentration of 15 μg of Chl.ml–1. The level of the variable fluorescence was used as a measurement for the reduction state of QA. During measurements the samples were kept under argon. No redox mediators were used (see Ref. 43Krieger A. Rutherford A.W. Johnson G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 193-201Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Potentials were measured with a combined Pt/AgCl/Ag electrode and normalized to the standard hydrogen electrode by calibrating the electrode with quinhydrone (a midpoint redox potential (Em) of 286 mV at pH 6.5, 25 °C). Reductive titrations were performed by gradual addition of sodium dithionite (dissolved in 40 mm MES, pH 6.5), oxidative titrations by addition of potassium ferricyanide. Addition of dithionite did not significantly change the pH of the medium. Fluorescence was measured with a PAM 101 fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) using a weak measuring light of 1.6 kHz. Measurement of the S2QA– Charge Recombination—The decrease of the maximal fluorescence yield in the seconds to minutes time range during photoinhibition was measured by using a modulated fluorometer (PAM, Walz). The decay of the fluorescence yield due to S2QA– charge recombination was measured using a double modulation fluorometer (PSI Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic) in the 1-ms to 30-s time range in whole cells (5 μg of Chl.ml–1), in the presence of 20 μm DCMU (dissolved in ethanol). To follow the reoxidation of QA–, a weak non-actinic probe flash was used. A small fraction of photons (∼12% in closed centers) of the probing flash is re-emitted as fluorescence. The variable fluorescence yield was measured with the same fluorometer. Measurements of the decay of S2QA– are not straightforward when measured as the decay of the fluorescence yield (44Joliot P. Joliot A. C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. Paris. 1964; 258: 4622-4625PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lavergne J. Trissl H.W. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2474-2492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 46Cuni A. Xiong L. Sayre R. Rappaport F. Lavergne J. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2004; 6: 4825-4831Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is known that the trapping efficiency of open reaction centers increases with the amount of closed reaction centers in the vicinity (44Joliot P. Joliot A. C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. Paris. 1964; 258: 4622-4625PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lavergne J. Trissl H.W. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2474-2492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Consequently, a fluorescence probe pulse does not detect closed and opened reaction centers equally, but instead open centers are favored as a function of the fraction of closed centers according to Equation 1, F(c)=c1+J−J⋅c(Eq. 1) where c is the fraction of closed centers, F(c) is the measured fluorescence yield, J is the Joliot antenna connectivity factor (44Joliot P. Joliot A. C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. Paris. 1964; 258: 4622-4625PubMed Google Scholar), and J + 1 is the average number of visited reaction centers per exciton. From Equation 1 it is easily deducible that 1) the observed decay kinetics of the fluorescence yield (i.e. F(c(t))) is non-linearly dependent on the re-oxidation kinetics of QA– (i.e. c(t)) if J > 0) and 2) the F(c(t)) is equal to the kinetics of the re-oxidation of QA– (i.e. c(t)) if J = 0). It was shown by Cuni et al. (46Cuni A. Xiong L. Sayre R. Rappaport F. Lavergne J. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2004; 6: 4825-4831Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that, if a weak enough excitation flash is applied, which induces charge separation in only a small proportion of the reaction centers (<15%), no correction is needed, just as if J = 0. This was always the case under our conditions. Under the conditions used, even with the lowest usable probe light intensity, the fluorescence yield probe flashes were only found to be non-actinic when a fluorescence probe pulse frequency of 5 Hz or less was used. However, with measuring pulses spaced at 200-ms intervals it is not possible to obtain a good measurement of the fast phase of decay. Therefore we had to use a different measuring protocol. In this protocol each sample was measured under four conditions resulting in four sets of experiments. Each set had a time base shifted by 50 ms up to 2 s and the same time base from that point forward. The kinetic traces (usually three) of each set were averaged, and the sets were merged together resulting in: (a) a higher temporal resolution for the fast kinetic phase and (b) a better signal-to-noise ratio for the slow kinetic phase. This protocol, however, introduces an uneven weighting of the data points, because each of the points from 0 to 2 s after the flash originate from only one set, whereas each point from 2 to 30 s represents the average of all four sets. To compensate for this effect the points from 2 to 30 s were weighted appropriately, i.e. th"
https://openalex.org/W2119589521,"We report the production of an important human therapeutic antibody in plant cell suspension cultures and the functional analysis of that antibody, including a comparison with the same antibody produced in CHO cells. We established transgenic tobacco BY2 suspension cell cultures expressing the human monoclonal antibody 2F5, which shows broadly neutralizing activity against HIV-1. The antibody was directed to the endoplasmic reticulum of the plant cells and was isolated by cell disruption, followed by protein A chromatography. The plant-derived antibody was shown to be largely intact by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Antigen binding activity was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and quantitatively determined by ELISA and Biacore biosensor technology. Ligand binding properties were analyzed using the ectodomain of human Fc gammaRI for kinetic analysis. The plant-derived antibody showed similar kinetic properties and 89% of the binding capacity of its CHO-derived counterpart, but was only 33% as efficient in HIV-1 neutralization assays. Our results show that plant suspension cultures can be used to produce human antibodies efficiently and that the analysis methods used in this study, including biosensor technology, provide useful functional data about antibody performance. This highlights important issues raised by the use of plant systems to produce human biologics."
https://openalex.org/W2005318351,"Visual motion perception relies on two opposing operations: integration and segmentation. Integration overcomes motion ambiguity in the visual image by spatial pooling of motion signals, whereas segmentation identifies differences between adjacent moving objects. For visual motion area MT, previous investigations have reported that stimuli in the receptive field surround, which do not elicit a response when presented alone, can nevertheless modulate responses to stimuli in the receptive field center. The directional tuning of this ""surround modulation"" has been found to be mainly antagonistic and hence consistent with segmentation. Here, we report that surround modulation in area MT can be either antagonistic or integrative depending upon the visual stimulus. Both types of modulation were delayed relative to response onset. Our results suggest that the dominance of antagonistic modulation in previous MT studies was due to stimulus choice and that segmentation and integration are achieved, in part, via adaptive surround modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2002267921,"The effects of glucose extremes on vascular physiology and endothelial cell function have been examined across a range of time scales. Not unexpectedly, chronic glucose exposure induces long term tissue effects. Yet short term exposure can also impose lasting consequences.

Slow turnover reservoirs such as basement membrane are candidates for prolongation of acute events.

These phenomena may explain long term effects on the endothelium of short term exposure to glucose extremes. Glucose is critical across the spectrum of biologic and physiologic processes. Yet in overabundance this sugar can produce profound systemic toxic effects. A primary manifestation of morbidity and mortality in diseases of glucose metabolism is unregulated remodeling and abnormal homeostasis of the vasculature. Much research has focused on long term exposure to elevated glucose, for example in diabetics. Indeed, though varied and vascular bed-dependent, vascular disease is diffuse and devastating in the diabetic and worse still with poor control of plasma glucose. Loss of renal filtration function in diabetic nephropathy follows glomerular capillary hypertrophy, and fragile new vessels formed by excessive angiogenesis create a unique retinopathy (1Tsilibary E. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Reduced angiogenesis in the extremities contributes to poor wound healing (2Martin A. Komada M.R. Sane D.C. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 117-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In the macrovasculature, diabetics demonstrate accelerated atherosclerosis, rapid and more extensive restenosis after endovascular intervention, and decreased collateral formation around blockages (3Beckman J.A. Creager M.A. Libby P. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 287: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 4Carrozza J.P. Kuntz R.E. Fishman R.F. Baim D.S. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 118: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These glucose effects persist long after restoration of euglycemia, and the possibility remains that acute fluctuations in local glucose concentration have prolonged cell and tissue effects. Alterations in vascular basement membrane, a dense amorphous protein mesh located basolateral to endothelial cells, may explain hyperglycemic memory in diabetic vascular disease. Historically, vascular basement membrane was viewed purely from a structural perspective as a platform on which endothelial cells reside. More recently, it has become clear that basement membrane supports a plethora of biochemical activities, including cell signaling mediation through integrin binding, storage and release of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) 2The abbreviations used are: FGF-2, fibroblast growth factor-2; tBHP, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PECAM, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule; Ve-cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin; NS, not significant; ANOVA, analysis of variance. and, even in degradation, production of protein fragments that promote or inhibit angiogenesis (5Bashkin P.

Throughout vascular beds, from kidney to eye to aorta, basement membrane thickens (1Tsilibary E. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Relative quantities of major protein components change, with increases in type IV collagen and fibronectin and decreases in laminin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (1Tsilibary E. J.

Histological analysis of human tissues has identified changes in basement membrane cytokine concentration, such as increased retinal FGF-2 in proliferative retinopathy (13Hanneken A. Dejuan E. Lutty G.A. Fox G.M. Schiffer S. Hjelmeland L.M. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1991; 109: 1005-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although no single biochemical diabetic alteration has been identified as the cause of these changes, hyperglycemia has been implicated (14Bangstad H.J. Osterby R. Dahljorgensen K. Berg K.J.

Diabetes. 1991; 40: 102-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, high glucose affects basement membrane protein production and leads to glycation of these proteins, altering both matrix-matrix and matrix-cell interactions (16Haitoglou C.S. Tsilibary E.C.

Using an in vitro hyperglycemic model, we investigated the influence of glucose on FGF-2 handling within the endothelial cell-basement membrane co-regulatory unit. Basement membrane FGF-2 levels were determined in low and high glucose culture, and basement membrane FGF-2 binding kinetics was measured. The effects of glucose-induced changes in endothelial cell FGF-2 release, permeability, and apoptosis on basement membrane FGF-2 storage were quantified, and in vitro results were correlated with in vivo data. Finally, we determined the effects of altered basement membrane FGF-2 on endothelial cell proliferation. We now show that basement membrane FGF-2 increases linearly with glucose exposure due to endothelial cell function alterations and that the change in basement membrane composition further affects endothelial cell function over an extended time scale. Cell Culture—Porcine aortic endothelial cells were isolated from Yorkshire swine aortae by the collagenase dispersion method and maintained in low glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 2% glutamine (Invitrogen) (19Wong M.K.K. Gotlieb A.I. Lab. Investig. 1984; 51: 75-81PubMed Google Scholar). Culture media was changed every 48 h, and cells were used between passages 4 and 9. For high glucose media, d-glucose was added to supplemented low glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (5 mm, 90 mg/dl) to a final concentration of 30 mm (540 mg/dl). Media glucose levels decreased over 4 days of culture due to cellular glucose consumption (5 mm glucose decreased to 2.4 ± 0.04 mm;30mm decreased to 22.4 ± 1.8 mm). Despite rapid endothelial cell glucose metabolism, the glucose level in high glucose media remained significantly higher than that of low glucose media over a 4-day experiment (p < 0.01). Although glucose effects continued to rise with higher glucose concentrations, values chosen are literature standards and remain close to the pathophysiologic range. For osmotic controls, mannitol (Sigma) was added to base media to achieve a 30 mm solution. Porcine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα; R&D Systems), a potent inflammatory cytokine, and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP; Sigma), which is broken down intracellularly to produce reactive oxygen species, were used as alternative methods to induce cell stress. Endothelial cells were exposed to TNFα for 24 h and tBHP for 48 h. Recombinant human FGF-2 was obtained from Peprotech, and blocking antibodies for FGF-2 and TNFα were from Upstate Biotechnology and Serotec, respectively. The blocking antibodies specifically neutralized FGF-2 and TNFα when compared with a vascular endothelial growth factor antibody as measured through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and apoptosis assays. Basement Membrane Isolation—Initial experiments demonstrated differential glucose effects on endothelial cells by 4 days; therefore, subsequent experiments used endothelial cells seeded near confluence and grown for 4 days in multiwell tissue culture polystyrene plates (12, 24, or 96 well; BD Biosciences). Cells in all glucose conditions reached confluence concurrently. 4% w/v dextran (40 kDa, Sigma) was added to media for the last 2 days to increase cellular basement membrane production (20Gospodarowicz D. Delgado D. Vlodavsky I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4094-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were lysed in 20 mm NH4OH with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma), after which wells were thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline (6Vlodavsky I. Folkman J. Sullivan R. Fridman R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Sasse J. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2292-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that basement membrane remained intact, adherent to the tissue culture plate, and free of cell debris. The total basement membrane protein for each condition was quantified by the Coomassie assay after digesting isolated basement membrane with trypsin (25 μg/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C (21Miao H.Q. IshaiMichaeli R. Atzmon R. Peretz T. Vlodavsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4879-4886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). FGF-2 Extraction, Collection, and Quantification—Basement membrane FGF-2 was extracted using a salt buffer (2 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), which was deemed sufficient after subsequent extractions failed to produce additional FGF-2 (22Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Total protein levels in FGF-2 extraction buffer ranged from 30 to 70 pg/ml and were not significantly different with glucose or osmotic controls. We further exposed isolated basement membrane to supplemented media for 4 days at 37 °C and were unable to extract measurable levels of FGF-2, confirming that exogenous FGF-2 from culture media fetal bovine serum did not significantly contribute to FGF-2 detected in basement membrane. Endothelial cell-released FGF-2 was measured in media collected from cell culture and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Tissue FGF-2 was prepared by homogenizing 3 × 3-mm porcine aortic tissue samples in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Homogenized samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged to pellet insoluble material. All FGF-2 samples were either used immediately or stored at -20 °C for later use. Basement membrane, cell-released, and tissue FGF-2 levels were quantified using an FGF-2 ELISA (R&D Systems). Extraction buffer, conditioning media, or tissue lysate buffer alone did not alter ELISA accuracy. Because each ELISA varied slightly, as did FGF-2 integrity in various buffers, FGF-2 was quantified immediately after each experiment using a single ELISA kit whenever possible. FGF-2 Binding Kinetics—All basement membrane FGF-2 binding kinetic experiments were performed at room temperature. Basement membrane FGF-2 equilibrium binding capacity was determined by adding FGF-2 in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, 0.05% w/v gelatin, pH 7.4) to isolated basement membrane at concentrations from 0 to 1 μg/ml. Equilibrium, defined as the time at which association and dissociation occur at balanced rates resulting in no change in basement membrane-bound FGF-2, occurred 2-3 h after growth factor addition. The FGF-2 solution was aspirated, basement membrane was washed in binding buffer to remove unbound FGF-2, and bound FGF-2 was extracted as described above. Basement membrane FGF-2 association was measured by adding 5 ng/ml FGF-2 in binding buffer to isolated basement membrane for 0-360 min. This concentration (5 ng/ml) is within the linear binding range and results in physiologically relevant bound FGF-2 levels. After the incubation period, FGF-2 was aspirated, basement membrane was washed in binding buffer, and bound FGF-2 was extracted as previously described (22Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Glycated FGF-2 was prepared by incubating 1 μg/ml FGF-2 in 0.25 m fructose for 24 h at 37 °C (23Giardino I. Edelstein D. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 110-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-2 basement membrane dissociation kinetics were determined by incubating isolated basement membrane with 5 ng/ml 125I-labeled FGF-2 in binding buffer to equilibrium (3 h). The 125I-labeled FGF-2 solution was removed, and binding buffer containing unlabeled FGF-2 (1 μg/ml) was added to each well for 0-360 min. Unlabeled FGF-2 was included in dissociation buffer to decrease rebinding of released 125I-labeled FGF-2 to the basement membrane. After the dissociation period, dissociation buffer was removed, and basement membrane-bound 125I-labeled FGF-2 was extracted (22Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled FGF-2 in dissociation buffer and extraction buffer was quantified in a gamma counter (Packard). Endothelial Cell Permeability—Endothelial cells were cultured for 4 days on 0.4-μm Costar Transwell inserts (Corning) in either 5 or 30 mm glucose supplemented media. After 4 days of glucose exposure, supplemented media was replaced by serum-free media with 1 mg/ml 10-kDa tetramethyl rhodamine-labeled dextran (Molecular Probes). At this size, the effective molecular radius of dextran resembles that of FGF-2. 50-μl samples were collected from media outside the insert well from 30 to 480 min after dextran addition and measured at 544/590 nm in a Fluoroskan fluorometer (ThermoLabsystems). Cell permeability to FGF-2 and subsequent binding to basement membrane was measured on cells cultured for 4 days in 5 or 30 mm glucose supplemented media. After 4 days of glucose exposure, supplemented media was replaced by serum-free media with 1 μg/ml FGF-2. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, basement membrane was isolated, and FGF-2 was extracted as described above. Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Analysis—Endothelial cell apoptosis was measured using four complementary methods: cell counts, annexin V-propidium iodide labeling, caspase 3 activation, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling. Cell counts were performed by trypsinizing cells and counting with a Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter). Annexin V binds phosphatidylserine translocated from the inner to the outer cell membrane. Cells in early apoptosis are identified as annexin V-positive and are negative for the vital dye propidium iodide. Endothelial cells were prepared for the annexin V-propidium iodide assay by combining floating and trypsin-released attached cells. Samples were centrifuged to pellet cells, washed thoroughly, resuspended in annexin binding buffer, and labeled with annexin V-fluorescein and propidium iodide as per the kit instructions (BD Pharmingen). Samples were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry (BD FACScan). Caspase 3, a cysteine protease activated during early apoptosis, is considered the “point of no return” for apoptotic cells. Activated caspase 3 was measured in endothelial cells both by a spectrofluorimetric assay and flow cytometry. For spectrofluorimetry, endothelial cells were lysed as per the kit instructions (BD Pharmingen), and 50 μl of cell lysate was incubated with 5 μl of N-acetyl-DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin in a multiwell plate for 1 h at 37°C. Ac-DEVD-aldehyde, a caspase inhibitor, was used as the negative control. 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) liberated from Ac-DEVD-AMC by activated caspase 3 was measured using a Fluoroskan at 380/450 nm. For flow cytometry, cells were collected as for the annexin V assay. Cells were fixed and permeabilized, then labeled with fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal rabbit anti-active caspase-3 antibody as per the kit instructions (BD Pharmingen). Samples were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling assay employed an APO-BRDU kit (BD Pharmingen) in which TdT catalyzes the addition of bromolated deoxyuridine triphosphates to 3′-OH ends of double- and single-stranded DNA fragments in late apoptosis. Cells were collected in the same way as for the annexin V assay. Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde, washed, resuspended in 70% v/v ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at -20 °C until use. For each experiment, samples were thawed, labeled as per kit instructions, and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. For cell cycle analysis, endothelial cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended at 37 °C in a stain solution of 3% w/v polyethylene glycol, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes), 180 units/ml RNase (Worthington), and 0.1% Triton X-100 ina4mm citrate buffer, pH 7.2. An equal volume of salt solution (3% w/v polyethylene glycol, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.4 m NaCl, pH 7.2) was added after 20 min. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C and measured by flow cytometry in the morning. Fluorescence Microcopy and Immunohistochemistry—Endothelial cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in 4% w/v paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4. Fixed cells were labeled with mouse monoclonal antibody to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM, CD31) (1:100, MCA1746, Serotec) and vascular endothelial cadherin (Ve-cadherin) (1:50, MCA1748, Serotec). After thorough washing, cells were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, A11017, Molecular Probes) and with Hoescht 33258 nuclear stain (1:1000). Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with 1:1 glycerolphosphate-buffered saline and imaged using either a 20×/0.5 or 40×/0.75 objective (Leica) in an inverted fluorescent microscope (CTRMIC; Leica). Hoescht and PECAM or Ve-cadherin images of the same microscope field were merged using Metamorph software, and background was subtracted uniformly from all images with Photoshop (Adobe). Intracellular and intercellular area were measured by tracing PECAM-labeled cell borders and counting pixels included or excluded, respectively, in Photoshop. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on frozen tissue sections (8 μm). Sections were acetone-fixed and air-dried for 24 h. Endogenous peroxidase activity was first quenched by incubating sections with peroxidase block, after which sections were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody to FGF-2 (1:250, MC-GF1, Abcam). Mouse nonspecific IgG served as the negative control. Sections were incubated with a peroxidase-labeled dextran polymer conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako Cytomation). Staining was completed by incubation with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine+ substrate-chromogen, which results in a brown-colored precipitate at FGF-2 sites. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted using Crystal Mount Aqueous Mounting media (Sigma). Sections were imaged using a 60×/1.40 oil objective (Nikon) with a Nikon Labophot-2 bright field microscope. Images were analyzed using Photoshop. Animal Model—Male domestic Yorkshire swine, initially 27-29 kg, were assigned to a control (n = 2) or diabetic group (n = 4). Before the study a vascular access port (Access Technologies) was surgically implanted into each pig via left external jugular vein catheterization (24Boullion R. Mokelke E.A. Wamhoff B.R. Otis C.R. Wenzel J. Dixon J.L. Sturek M. Comp. Med. 2003; 53: 42-52PubMed Google Scholar). All pigs received intramuscular buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) on the day of surgery. Anesthesia was induced with intramuscular xylazine (2 mg/kg), atropine (0.04 mg/kg), butorphanol (0.55 mg/kg), and Telazol (6.6 mg/kg). Pigs were intubated, and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane inhalant (0.5-1.5%) via an endotracheal tube. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin injection (50 mg/kg in 0.1 mol/liter sodium citrate, pH 4.5) each day for 3 days (25Gerrity R. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Kimsey T. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). All animals were fed a normal diet. Fasting blood glucose concentrations were measured once a week using a standard, portable glucometer. Blood glucose concentrations were maintained at 200-250 mg/dl by adjusting daily insulin injections for the 9-week study period duration (24Boullion R. Mokelke E.A. Wamhoff B.R. Otis C.R. Wenzel J. Dixon J.L. Sturek M. Comp. Med. 2003; 53: 42-52PubMed Google Scholar). Serum lipids were measured at end point in a routine diagnostic analyzer using enzymatic colorimetric assays. Insulin therapy consisted of a mixture containing regular and NPH insulin (Eli Lilly). At the study completion, animals were anesthetized and euthanized with KCl, 40 mEq intravenous. An abdominal aortic segment was rapidly excised, washed thoroughly in phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Aortic samples were stored at -80 °C until use. This study conformed to United States Department of Agriculture regulations and National Research Council guidelines and to guidelines specified in the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harvard Medical School (Boston) approved the study. Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed with Prism software (Graphpad). Data were normally distributed and expressed as the mean ± S.D. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed by Student’s t test, and comparisons between more than 2 groups were analyzed by ANOVA. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and is indicated in the text as such or in figures with a pound sign (#). A value of p < 0.01 is indicated with an asterisk (*). Basement Membrane FGF-2—FGF-2, among other angiogenic growth factors, has been implicated in diabetic vascular dysfunction. Here, we show that the FGF-2 concentration in the endothelial cell basement membrane increases with both time and glucose exposure. After only 4 days in culture, basement membrane from cells cultured in 30 mm glucose stored significantly more FGF-2 than that from cells cultured in 5 mm glucose (p < 0.005). Only d-glucose increased basement membrane FGF-2; osmotic control mannitol was without effect on basement membrane FGF-2 levels (Fig. 1B). Basement membrane FGF-2 increased linearly up to 50 mm culture glucose (Fig. 1C, r2 = 0.79). TNFα and tBHP addition resulted in similar dose-dependent increases in FGF-2, but neutralization of TNFα did not abrogate the glucose effect on basement membrane FGF-2 (Table 1).TABLE 1Basement membrane FGF-2 increases with environmental stressEnvironmental stressGlucoseTNFαtBHPGlucose + TNFα antibodymmng/mlmmLow15.6 ± 1.217.9 ± 2.613.6 ± 0.716.5 ± 1.7Medium23.6 ± 4.3ap < 0.05.25.4 ± 2.4ap < 0.05.20.3 ± 2.5ap < 0.05.27.6 ± 5.9bp < 0.01.High30.0 ± 3.6bp < 0.01.41.3 ± 6.4bp < 0.01.59.3 ± 4.6bp < 0.01.32.1 ± 3.9bp < 0.01.a p < 0.05.b p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Basement Membrane-FGF Binding Kinetics—We examined basement membrane FGF-2 binding kinetics to elucidate the role of glucose-induced basement membrane alterations in increasing FGF-2 storage. No significant difference in basement membrane FGF-2 binding capacity with culture glucose was observed across a wide range of FGF-2 concentrations (Fig. 2A). Equilibrium binding capacity remained linear far beyond the physiologic range (0-100 ng/ml; p < 0.0001, r2 = 0.99), reaching a plateau between 5 and 10 μg/ml soluble FGF-2. Similarly, both FGF-2 association and dissociation with isolated basement membrane were unchanged by glucose whether basement membrane was grown in varied glucose (association data Fig. 2B; dissociation data not shown) or glucose was present in binding buffer. Only FGF-2 glycation significantly altered basement membrane FGF-2 binding kinetics, leading to decreased association with basement membrane (Fig. 2B). These data were confirmed by measuring FGF-2 binding to a heparin-Sepharose column. These data then suggest that the increase in basement membrane FGF-2 with glucose is not related to an inherent change in binding kinetics. Basement Membrane Exposure to FGF-2—We next considered whether basement membrane was exposed to more soluble FGF-2 through glucose-induced endothelial cell FGF-2 release. With a rise in glucose concentration from 5 to 30 mm, endothelial cells released twice as much FGF-2 into the media over a 48-h period (Fig. 3). A similar dose-dependent increase in media FGF-2 was observed when TNFα or tBHP was added to culture media but not with osmotic control mannitol. Endothelial cell permeability with glucose was investigated to determine whether released FGF-2 could access and bind to basement membrane. Because FGF-2 did not traverse the Transwell insert membrane without some binding, dimensionally equivalent but inert 10-kDa dextran was examined. Cell permeability to dextran after 4 days of glucose exposure increased acutely in a glucose dose-dependent manner when new glucose media was added (Fig. 4A). Cell permeability peaked at ∼90 min and returned to base-line conditions by 180 min for 17.5 mm glucose and 360 min for 30 mm glucose. Specific endothelial cell permeability to FGF-2, measured by extracting FGF-2 in basement membrane after applying an FGF-2 load, also rose with exposure to glucose and low levels of TNFα or tBHP (Fig. 4B). FGF-2 bound to basement membrane increased 6-fold in cells exposed to TNFα or tBHP over unexposed cells. Continuous PECAM and Ve-cadherin along cell borders for all glucose levels (Fig. 5) indicated that the increase in endothelial cell permeability occurred without"

Further studies demonstrated that both Smad and RhoA signaling are critical for TGF-β-induced VSMC development. To identify downstream targets, we performed Affymetrix cDNA array analysis of Monc-1 cells and identified a gene named response gene to complement 32 (RGC-32) to be important for the VSMC differentiation. RGC-32 expression was increased 5-fold after 2 h and 50-fold after 24 h of TGF-β induction. Knockdown of RGC-32 expression in Monc-1 cells by small interfering RNA significantly inhibited the expression of multiple smooth muscle marker genes, including SM α-actin (α-SMA), SM22α, and calponin. Of importance, the inhibition of RGC-32 expression correlated with the reduction of α-SMA while not inhibiting smooth muscle-unrelated c-fos gene expression, suggesting that RGC-32 is an important protein factor for VSMC differentiation from neural crest cells. Moreover, RGC-32 overexpression significantly enhanced TGF-β-induced α-SMA, SM22α, and SM myosin heavy chain promoter activities in both Monc-1 and C3H10T1/2 cells. The induction of VSMC gene promoters by RGC-32 appears to be CArG-dependent. These data suggest that RGC-32 controls VSMC differentiation by regulating marker gene transcription in a CArG-dependent manner.

Investig. 1997; 100: S87-89PubMed Google Scholar). In many of these diseases, it is the ability of VSMCs to modulate their phenotype that leads to pathology. Unlike skeletal or cardiac muscle, VSMCs exhibit a wide variation of phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo (8Parmacek M.S. Curr. Top Dev. Biol. 2001; 51: 69-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of VSMCs to change from a contractile to a synthetic (proliferative) phenotype, while entering the cell cycle and proliferating, may underlie some of the pathological findings in the vascular proliferative disorders mentioned above (9Schwartz S.M. Murry C.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 437-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These dedifferentiated cells display a phenotype closely resembling that of developing VSMCs observed during embryonic angiogenesis (10Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that control VSMC development and differentiation will provide fundamental insights into several pathological processes, including atherosclerosis, and eventually will lead to the identification of targets for therapeutic intervention.VSMCs are derived from at least three precursor cell types, depending on the timing and location of formation (11Hungerford J.E. Little C.D. J. Vasc Res. 1999; 36: 2-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 12Gittenberger-de Groot A.C. DeRuiter M.C. Bergwerff M. Poelmann R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three major sources of VSMCs outside of the cardiac circulation in the vertebrate embryo are the neural crest, mesodermal precursors, and endothelium or endothelial stem cells. The other sources of vascular SMC include proepicardial organ and the dermamyotome of the somite (13Hirschi K.K. Majesky M.W. Anat. Rec. 2004; 276A: 22-33Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Brand-Saberi B. Christ B. Curr. Top Dev. Biol. 2000; 48: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Neural crest stem cells are the primary precursor cells that form VSMCs in parts of the cranial circulation, cardiac outflow tracts, and great vessels (15Etchevers H.C. Vincent C. Le Douarin N.M. Couly G.F. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Baldwin H.S. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 1999; 11: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mouse mutants defective in neural crest formation exhibit severe defects in cardiac development reminiscent of DiGeorge syndrome (17Epstein J.A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: S13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), underscoring the importance in understanding how VSMCs develop from these precursors. Several factors have been shown to serve as intrinsic and extrinsic fate determinants for neural crest cells (18Epstein J.A. Li J. Lang D. Chen F. Brown C.B. Jin F. Lu M.M. Thomas M. Liu E.

The in vivo signals that specify neural crest commitment to the VSMC lineage have not been fully identified, but TGF-β plays an important role both in vivo and in vitro (26Shah N.M. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11369-11374Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27Shah N.M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J.

Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3781-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TGF-β family members transmit signals through transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors (29Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar). The TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) binds ligand and recruits and phosphorylates the type I receptor, activating its kinase activity. Activated type I receptor then binds and phosphorylates downstream signaling intermediates called Smads. Activated Smads translocate to the nucleus where they regulate target gene transcription (30Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Recent studies have shown that specific inactivation of TGF-β signaling in neural crest stem cells results in cardiovascular SMC defects. The TβRII knock-out in neural crest cells abolished the development of smooth musculature at embryonic day 10.5. At later developmental stages, neural crest cells that failed to adopt a smooth muscle cell fate underwent apoptotic cell death. These results suggest that the smooth muscle α-actin-positive cells generated from TGF-β-treated neural crest cells in culture indeed represent SMCs (31Wurdak H. Ittner L.M. Lang K.S. Leveen P. Suter U. Fischer J.A. Karlsson S. Born W. Sommer L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A later report from a different group using the same strategy to mutate TβRII in neural crest failed to identify SMC defects, possibly due to an in vivo compensatory mechanism or the use of a different TβRII-floxed mouse line, as discussed by the authors (32Choudhary B. Ito Y. Makita T. Sasaki T. Chai Y. Sucov H.M. Dev. Biol. 2006; 289: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The function of TGF-β signaling on VSMC differentiation from neural crest cells remains controversial. Our in vitro studies have shown that TGF-β robustly induced expression of VSMC markers in neural crest Monc-1 cells (33Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that Smad and RhoA play critical roles in mediating TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation (34Chen S.

Downstream targets of TGF-β signaling important for VSMC differentiation from neural crest cells, however, remain to be determined.In the present study, by performing Affymetrix cDNA array analysis and a small RNA interference (siRNA) assay, we have identified a protein, namely response gene to complement (RGC)-32, to be critical for TGF-β-induced VSMC differentiation. Further studies showed that RGC-32 controls VSMC differentiation by regulating the transcription of SMC-specific genes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Monc-1 cells were grown as described (35Rao M.S. Anderson D.J. J. Neurobiol. 1997; 32: 722-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). C3H10T1/2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, glucose, and l-glutamine supplemented with penicillin.Mouse RGC-32 Expression Vector Construction—Mouse RGC-32 cDNA was amplified from mRNA extracted from TGF-β-treated Monc-1 cells. The 5′ primer included a BamHI restriction site for cloning, a Kozak sequence, and a T7 tag followed by a RGC-32 cDNA sequence. The 3′ primer included RGC-32 cDNA sequence, a stop codon, and an XbaI restriction site. RGC-32 full-length cDNA was amplified with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). For cloning, both pcDNA 3.0 vector and amplified RGC-32 cDNA were digested with BamHI and XbaI and then purified, followed by ligation using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The cloned cDNA was verified by sequencing. RGC-32 overexpression in Monc-1 cells was confirmed by Western blot using T7 antibody (Novagen).RNA Interference—To knock down RGC-32 expression, Monc-1 cells were transfected with RGC-32 siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. 6 h later, the cells were treated with TGF-β (5 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cells were then collected for analysis of RGC-32 and SMC marker expression. RGC-32 siRNAs (5′-CCUGGCCAUUCUUGGUUCACUAUAA-3′) were purchased from Invitrogen.Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Quantitative PCR (qPCR)—RT-PCR and qPCR were performed as described previously. RGC-32 primer sequences were: 5′-AAGCCGCCCTCAGCGCAGAGCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATACTTGCTAAGGTCCTG-3′ (reverse). Primers for SMC marker genes α-SMA, SM22α, calponin, and SMC-nonspecific gene c-fos were previously described (33Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—α-SMA wild type and CArG box mutants and myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) promoter luciferase reporter constructs were generously provided by Dr. Gary Owens (36Yoshida T.

SM22α promoter luciferase reporter construct was previously described (37Chen S. Kulik M. Lechleider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). pcDNA or RGC-32 expression vector co-transfection with promoter construct into Monc-1 or C3H10T1/2 cells followed by luciferase assay was performed similarly as described previously (33Chen S. Lechleider R.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), except that the cells were growth factor- (Monc-1 cells) or serum-(10T1/2 cells) starved and then TGF-β-treated for 48 h before luciferase assay.Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance with pairwise comparisons between groups. A level of p values < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSWe have previously described that Smad and RhoA are the two pathways critical for TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation from Monc-1 cells. To identify the earliest downstream targets that may initiate the differentiation program, we treated Monc-1 cells with TGF-β for 24 h and then performed microarray analyses using Affymetrix chips. RGC-32 was identified to be highly up-regulated (15-fold) by TGF-β (data not shown). RGC-32 was first identified in oligodendrocytes in response to complement activation (38Badea T.C. Niculescu F.I.

Functionally, RGC-32 has been shown to play a role in cell cycle activation. It is a substrate and regulator of cyclin-dependent kinase p34CDC2 (39Badea T. Niculescu F. Soane L. Fosbrink M. Sorana H.

Whether RGC-32 is involved in VSMC differentiation, however, remains to be determined.To confirm the TGF-β induction of RGC-32, we performed regular RT-PCR and qPCR to determine RGC-32 expression in Monc-1 cells. We found that TGF-β significantly up-regulated RGC-32 expression in Monc-1 cells. qPCR showed that RGC-32 was significantly up-regulated as early as within 2 h of TGF-β induction. The induction was increased 50-fold after 24 h of treatment and remained increased for up to 4 days, the longest time tested (supplemental Fig. S1).To determine whether RGC-32 is functionally important for SMC differentiation, we used siRNA to knock down RGC-32 expression in Monc-1 cells and then treated the cells with TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 1, RGC-32 siRNA effectively inhibited RGC-32 expression, and at the same time, blocked the expression of marker genes including α-SMA, SM22α, and calponin (Fig. 1A). Importantly, inhibition of RGC-32 expression correlated with the reduction of α-SMA but did not affect SMC-nonspecific c-fos gene expression (Fig. 1B). Control siRNA did not inhibit the expression of any genes. These data suggest that RGC-32 is essential for TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation from Monc-1 cells.Because transcriptional regulation is an important process in SMC differentiation, we decided to test whether RGC-32 regulates SMC marker promoter activity. We cloned RGC-32 cDNA into pcDNA expression vector and then co-transfected the expression vector with α-SMA, SM22α, or SM-MHC promoter constructs into Monc-1 cells. Luciferase assays showed that RGC-32 significantly enhanced TGF-β-induced promoter activities of all the three marker genes (Fig. 2, A–C).FIGURE 2RGC-32 enhances promoter activity of SMC markers in Monc-1 and 10T1/2 cells. α-SMA, SM22α, or SM-MHC promoter construct was individually co-transfected with pcDNA 3.0 or RGC-32 expression vector into Monc-1 (A–C) or 10T1/2 (D–F) cells followed by TGF-β (5 ng/ml) induction as indicated. Luciferase assays were then performed.

Functional analysis revealed that RGC-32 regulated α-SMA and SM22α in 10T1/2 cells in a manner similar to Monc-1 cells (Fig. 2, D and E). Interestingly, RGC-32 appeared to be more potent in regulating SM-MHC promoter activity in 10T1/2 than in Monc-1 cells (compare Fig. 2F with 2C), suggesting that the mechanism for SMC differentiation of Monc-1 cells is different from that of 10T1/2 cells.SRF and its cofactor myocardin play important roles in SMC differentiation (36Yoshida T.

We found that CArG box mutation in the promoter region (CArGs A+B) completely blocked the RGC-32 function on α-SMA promoter activity (Fig. 3). The intronic CArG mutation also significantly inhibited RGC-32 function but to a lesser extent than CArG A+B mutation (Fig. 3).

To determine whether Smad and RhoA signaling are important for RGC-32 activation, we used Smad7 to block Smad signaling, and C3 exotoxin to block RhoA signaling. We found that both Smad7 and C3 exotoxin significantly inhibited TGF-β-induced RGC-32 expression in Monc-1 cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that both Smad signaling and RhoA are important for RGC-32 activation during TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation from Monc-1 cells.FIGURE 4Smad and RhoA signaling are important for RGC-32 activation.

In this report, by performing Affymetrix microarray analyses, we identified RGC-32 to be essential for TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation. Blockade of RGC-32 expression using siRNA significantly inhibited the expression of multiple SMC-specific genes but did not inhibit SMC-nonspecific gene. Further studies demonstrated that RGC-32 controls SMC differentiation by regulating SMC marker gene transcription. Overexpression of RGC-32 in both Monc-1 and 10T1/2 cells significantly up-regulated TGF-β-induced α-SMA, SM22α, and SM-MHC promoter activities.Expression of most SMC marker genes has been shown to be regulated by multiple CArG elements and SRF (49Manabe I.

RGC-32 regulation of α-SMA promoter is also CArG-dependent, suggesting that RGC-32 may participate in SRF-associated regulatory network for SMC differentiation. Whether RGC-32 is a cofactor of SRF in neural crest cells is a subject of future study.TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation from Monc-1 cells requires both Smad and RhoA signaling (33Chen S.

Therefore, we conclude that TGF-β-induced SMC differentiation from Monc-1 cells is regulated as follows. TGF-β first activates Smad and RhoA signaling, which further activate RGC-32. RGC-32, together with other transcriptional factors including SRF and Smads, then turns on SMC maker gene transcription and initiates SMC differentiation.

During myotube formation of C2C12 cells, the expression of AChET protein and the enzymatic activity were dramatically increased, but the level of G4 AChE was relatively decreased. This G4 AChE in C2C12 cells was specifically recognized by anti-PRiMA antibody, suggesting the association of this enzyme with PRiMA. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the level of PRiMA mRNA was reduced during the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Overexpression of PRiMA in C2C12 myotubes significantly increased the production of G4 AChE. The oligomerization of G4 AChE, however, did not require the intracellular cytoplasmic tail of PRiMA. After overexpressing the muscle regulatory factors, myogenin and MyoD, the expressions of PRiMA and G4 AChE in cultured myotubes were markedly reduced. In addition, calcitonin gene-related peptide, a known motor neuron-derived factor, and muscular activity were able to suppress PRiMA expression in muscle; the suppression was mediated by the phosphorylation of a cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. In accordance with the in vitro results, sciatic nerve denervation transiently increased the expression of PRiMA mRNA and decreased the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein as well as its activator calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in muscles.

Depending on alternative splicing in the 3′ region of the primary transcript, AChE exists in different molecular forms (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). This process generates different subunits that contain the same catalytic domain but with distinct carboxyl termini (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 2Massoulié J. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 130-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In mammals, the AChER variant produces a soluble monomer that is up-regulated in the brain during stress (3Pick M. Flores-Flores C. Soreq H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1018: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); the AChEH variant produces a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored dimer that is mainly expressed in blood cells; the AChET variant is the only subunit expressed in the brain and muscle. AChET subunits form nonamphiphilic tetramers with a collagen tail (ColQ) as asymmetric AChE (A12 AChE) in muscle and also form amphiphilic tetramers associated with a proline-rich membrane anchor (PRiMA) as globular form AChE (G4 AChE) in brain and muscle (4Dvir H.

Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 130-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar); its expression pattern exhibits a close resemblance to PRiMA RNA expression (6Perrier A.L. Massoulié J. Krejci E. Neuron. 2002; 33: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition to the key role of AChE in cholinergic function, the correct orientation of AChE catalytic subunits at the cell surfaces of certain neurons, targeted by PRiMA, is proposed to be required for neurite outgrowth (7Sternfeld M. Ming G. Song H. Sela K. Timberg R. Poo M. Soreq H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1240-1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, G4 AChE in the brain is related to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease and may contribute to its development (8Inestrosa N.C. Alarcon R. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, G4 AChE may have distinct functions in different tissues.Although G4 is not the major form of AChE in muscle, its existence is tightly controlled. Several studies have revealed that the level of G4 AChE is controlled by the dynamic activity of skeletal muscles. In mammals, fast twitch muscles contain a high amount of G4, whereas slow twitch muscles contain a much smaller amount (9Bacou F. Vigneron P. Massoulié J. Nature. 1982; 296: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Alteration of the G4 AChE level after muscle denervation strongly suggests a critical role of motor nerves in G4 AChE regulation (2Massoulié J. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 130-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10Hodges-Savola C.A. Fernandez H.L. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1423-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The motor nerves may achieve this regulation by two distinct mechanisms: release of trophic factor and nerve-evoked electrical activity. Among the known nerve-derived trophic factors, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide with 37 amino acids, which has been identified in spinal cord motor neurons (11New H.V. Mudge A.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 809-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), exerts an innervation-like effect to suppress G4 AChE when applied in muscles (12Fernandez H.L. Hodges-Savola C.A. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 1369-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, CGRP regulates the synthesis of the AChET subunit (13Choi R.C.Y. Yung L.Y. Dong T.T.X. Wan D.C.C.

Nature. 1986; 323: 809-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). On the other hand, exercise induces a marked change in the level of this enzyme form, without modification of other molecular species (16Fernandez H.L. Donoso J.A. J. Appl.

Unfortunately, G4 AChE was analyzed only by sedimentation, and the expression of PRiMA, the only G4-specific component, has not been studied under physiological conditions.In this study, we sought to identify PRiMA-associated G4 AChE in cultured C2C12 muscle cells and to analyze the expression of mRNAs encoding PRiMA, as well as AChET, in cultured C2C12 cells during myogenic differentiation, the influence of nerve-derived factors and muscular activity, and the effect of denervation in fast twitch and slow twitch muscles. Our results indicate that myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), muscular activity, and CGRP suppress the expression of PRiMA, probably mainly by activating the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor. In addition, the production of G4 AChE in muscle is shown to be controlled by the level of PRiMA expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—The mouse C2C12 muscle cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in a water-saturated 5% CO2 incubator. All reagents for cell cultures were from Invitrogen. Myogenic differentiation was induced as previously described (19Siow N.L. Choi R.C.Y. Cheng A.W.M. Jiang J.X. Wan D.C.C. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W.K. J.

In brief, the cultured myoblasts were allowed to grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum until they were confluent, and then they were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% heat-inactivated horse serum to induce differentiation. In the myogenesis studies, cell lysates were collected on each day starting from the first day of induction (day 0) to the eighth day (day 7), and the extracts were stored at –80 °C. The drug treatments were carried out on 4-day-old myotube cultures. The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T fibroblast cell line was obtained from the ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a water-saturated 5% CO2 incubator.DNA Construction and Transfection—cDNAs encoding full-length mouse PRiMA (PRiMA I), and a COOH-terminal truncated mutant (PRiMA IΔC-term; obtained by deleting the COOH-terminal region, residues 122–153) were tagged by FLAG epitope (obtained by inserting a FLAG epitope of DYKDE at position 36 between the putative signal sequence and the NH2 terminus) in pER-BOS mammalian expression vector (6Perrier A.L. Massoulié J. Krejci E. Neuron. 2002; 33: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The mouse myogenin and MyoD cDNAs were described by Lee et al. (20Lee H.H.C. Choi R.C.Y. Ting A.K.L. Siow N.L. Jiang J.X. Massoulié J. Tsim K.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27098-27107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Vectors expressing the CREB (wild-type) and K-CREB (inactive mutant) cDNAs were purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). The cDNA encoding the constitutively active form of rat calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-γ (CaMKII-γ) was subcloned into pCS2MT vector (21Tang H. Macpherson P. Argetsinger L.S. Cieslak D. Suhr S.T. Carter-Su C. Goldman D. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of myoblasts with the cDNA construct was performed with a Lipofectamin Plus reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfection efficiency was consistently 30–40% in the C2C12 myoblasts. The transfection in the cultured HEK293T fibroblasts was done by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (15Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H. Tsim K.W.K. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Production and Purification of Anti-PRiMA Polyclonal Antibody—The mouse PRiMA (from amino acid 114 to 153)-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysE Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) and purified by glutathione bead chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After digestion by thrombin (Sigma), the PRiMA-(114–153) antigen was purified by Superdex 75 10/300 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in a 2-kg male New Zealand White rabbit by immunization with 750 μg of antigen, mixed with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). The immunization was carried out with the same amount of antigen three times within 1 month. The anti-PRiMA serum was collected and purified by protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of purified antibody was determined spectrophotometrically.Drug Treatments—Four-day-old cultured myotubes were treated with either acetylcholine chloride (ACh; 10 and 100 μm), depolarizing agent potassium chloride (KCl; 10 or 20 mm), Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (0.2 or 0.5 μm), CGRP (1 μm), or N6, O2′-dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2-cAMP; 0.3 and 1 mm) for 2 days. Pretreatment with KN62 (20 μm; an inhibitor of CaMKII) was done for 3 h before the drug application. In phosphorylation analyses, myotube cultures were serum-starved for 3 h before the drug application. All of the drugs were purchased from Sigma.Sciatic Nerve Denervation—Two-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ∼250 g were anesthetized by isoflurane. Denervation was performed by removing a ∼3-mm portion of the sciatic nerve located around the upper thigh by an aseptic surgical technique (22Tsim K.W.K. Choi R.C.Y. Dong T.T.X. Wan D.C.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Rats were sacrificed according to the instructions of the Animal Care Facility at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Soleus and tibialis muscles were collected on days 1, 2, 5, and 8 after denervation. Muscle samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after dissection and stored at –80 °C before the RNA or protein extraction. Control experiments were performed by sham operations on the same muscles of different rats.Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA from either C2C12 cultures or rat tissues was isolated by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 5 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR of PRiMA, AChET, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase transcripts was performed on equal amounts of reverse-transcribed products, using SYBR Green Master mix and Rox reference dye, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Bioscience, Foster City, CA). The primers were as follows: 5′-TCT GAC TGT CCT GGT CAT CAT TTG CTA C-3′ and 5′-TCA CAC CAC CGC AGC GTT CAC-3′ for mouse PRiMA I and II (GenBank™ numbers NM 133364 and NM 178023); 5′-CTG GGG TGC GGA TCG GTG TAC CCC-3′ and 5′-TCA CAG GTC TGA GCA GCG TTC CTG-3′ for mouse AChET (23Ting A.K.L. Siow N.L. Kong L.W. Tsim K.W.K. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2005; 157: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); and 5′-AAC GGA TTT GGC CGT ATT GG-3′ and 5′-CTT CCC GTT CAG CTC TGG G-3′ for mouse and rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (21Tang H. Macpherson P. Argetsinger L.S. Cieslak D. Suhr S.T. Carter-Su C. Goldman D. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The SYBR green signal was detected by a Mx3000p™ multiplex quantitative PCR machine (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The transcript expression levels were quantified by using the Ct value method (24Liang D. Li X. Lighthall G. Clark J.D. Neuroscience. 2003; 121: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), where values were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control in the same sample. The PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and the specificity of amplification was confirmed by the melting curves.Immunochemical Analysis—C2C12 cultures, cDNA-transfected HEK 293T cultures, and muscle and brain tissues were homogenized in a lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml bacitracin), followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein samples were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min in a buffer containing 1% SDS and 1% dithiothreitol and separated by 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the Western blot analysis, we used anti-PRiMA polyclonal antibody (purified at 0.5 μg/ml), anti-AChET antibody (1:5,000; BD Biosciences), anti-FLAG antibody (1:1,000; Sigma), anti-myogenin, and anti-MyoD antibodies (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:5,000; Sigma), anti-phospho-CaMKII and anti-total CaMKII antibodies (1:1,000; Upstate, Billerica, MA), and anti-phospho-CREB and anti-total CREB antibodies (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The immune complexes were visualized using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). The intensities of the bands in the control and stimulated samples, run on the same gel and under strictly standardized ECL conditions, were compared on an image analyzer, using, in each case, a calibration plot constructed from a parallel gel with serial dilutions of one of the samples. In the immunofluorescent analysis, the cDNA-transfected HEK293T cells, after 2 days of transfection, were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, followed by 50 mm ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) treatment for 25 min. Cultures were permeabilized and blocked by 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-PRiMA antibody (2 μg/ml) and anti-FLAG antibody (dilution 1:500) were applied to the cells for 16 h at 4 °C followed by the corresponding Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were dehydrated serially with 50, 75, 95, and 100% ethanol and mounted with a fluorescence mounting medium (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). The samples were then examined by a Leica confocal microscope with excitation 488 nm/emission 505–550 nm for green color.Sucrose Density Gradients—Separation of the various molecular forms of AChE was performed by sucrose density gradient analysis, as described previously (15Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H. Tsim K.W.K. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, sucrose gradients (5 and 20%) in a lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) were prepared in 12-ml polyallomer ultracentrifugation tubes with a 0.4-ml cushion of 60% sucrose on the bottom. Cell extracts (0.2 ml) mixed with sedimentation markers (alkaline phosphatase, 6.1 S; β-galactosidase, 16 S) were loaded onto the gradients and centrifuged at 38,000 rpm in a Sorvall TH 641 rotor at 4 °C for 16 h. Approximately 45 fractions were collected, and the AChE enzymatic activity was determined according to the method described by Ellman (25Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Feather-Stone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (20961) Google Scholar) with the modification of adding 0.1 mm tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide, an inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase, to each fraction. The absorbance at 410 nm was recorded as a function of the reaction time. The amount of the various AChE forms was determined by summation of the enzymatic activities corresponding to the peaks of the sedimentation profile. In the immunoprecipitation of G4 AChE by anti-PRiMA antibody, brain, muscle, and C2C12 cell extracts (1 ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml bacitracin) were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with purified anti-PRiMA antibody (10 μg/ml). Then 50 μl of washed protein G-agarose gel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were loaded on sucrose gradients for sedimentation analysis.Other Assays—Protein concentrations were measured routinely using Bradford's method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar) with a kit from Bio-Rad. Statistical tests were run on the PRIMER program, version 1 (40Glantz S.A. Primer of Biostatistics. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1988Google Scholar); differences from basal or control values (as shown in the plots) were classified as significant for p < 0.05 (*) and highly significant for p < 0.01 (**) and p < 0.001 (***).RESULTSRegulation of G4 AChE and PRiMA during Myogenic Differentiation—Cultured mouse C2C12 cells were used as a model system for determining the expression profile of AChE during myogenic differentiation. In the absence of serum, C2C12 myoblasts were allowed to undergo fusion, forming multinucleated myotubes. The Western blots showed that AChET protein (∼68 kDa) increased by ∼8.5-fold in C2C12 cells during myogenesis, whereas the loading control, α-tubulin (∼55 kDa), remained unchanged (Fig. 1A). In line with the protein profile, the enzymatic activity of AChE dramatically increased (∼12-fold) from the myoblast to the myotube stage (Fig. 1A), in agreement with previous results (19Siow N.L. Choi R.C.Y. Cheng A.W.M. Jiang J.X. Wan D.C.C. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36129-36136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Sucrose density gradient analysis was used to investigate the AChE molecular forms found during the process of muscle differentiation. At the myoblast stage (day 0), AChE existed predominantly in the G4 form, together with trace amounts of the G1 form (Fig. 1B). When the myoblasts fused to form myotubes on day 4, the relative amount of G4 AChE was reduced, and G1 AChE became the predominant form. A small amount of A12 AChE (ColQ-associated) appeared in mature myotubes on day 7 (Fig. 1B). By quantifying the absolute amount of G1/G4 AChE in muscle during differentiation, we found that the amount of G4 increased by ∼4-fold on day 4 (as well as on day 7) of myotube formation; however, the increase in G1 was more robust (over 100-fold) (Fig. 1C). These results reveal that although AChET protein and enzymatic activity are up-regulated during the myogenic differentiation process, the relative proportion of G4 AChE decreases.Besides in brain enzymes, the association of PRiMA with G4 AChE has not been identified biochemically in other tissues. We generated anti-PRiMA polyclonal antibody to address this gap. In FLAG-tagged PRiMA cDNA-transfected HEK293T cells, both anti-PRiMA and anti-FLAG antibodies recognized a protein band of ∼20 kDa, corresponding to the predicted size of PRiMA, in our Western blots (Fig. 2A, left). The recognition could be blocked by the preincubation of anti-PRiMA antibody with excess amounts of PRiMA peptides. This did not occur with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A, right). In parallel, the antibody recognition was further confirmed in the immunofluorescent staining of FLAG-tagged PRiMA cDNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). These results indicated the specificity of our anti-PRiMA antibody.FIGURE 2Identification of PRiMA-associated AChE in C2C12 cells by using anti-PRiMA antibody. A, FLAG-tagged PRiMA cDNA (different amounts) was transfected into cultured HEK293T cells for 2 days. Twenty μg of protein from the collected cell lysate was loaded per lane for Western blots. Both anti-PRiMA and anti-FLAG antibodies were used to recognize the PRiMA band. In the blocking experiment, excess amounts of recombinant PRiMA peptide (from residue 114 to 153) at 5 μg/ml were incubated with anti-PRiMA antibody (0.5 μg/ml) for 4 h at 4 °C before it was applied to the Western blotting. B, the DNA-transfected HEK293T cells as in A were stained with anti-PRiMA and anti-FLAG antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The control was stained with preimmune serum. C, 30 μgof protein from extracts of C2C12 cells (myoblast or myotube), adult rat tibialis, and brain was loaded per lane for Western blots. The blocking by PRiMA peptide was done as in A. D, 1 ml of extract from adult rat brain, muscle (tibialis), or cultured C2C12 myoblasts was incubated with anti-PRiMA antibody (Ab) (10 μg/ml). After the precipitation by protein G-agarose, the supernatant (0.2 ml) was subjected to sucrose density gradient analysis. Preimmune serum was used in the control. AChE activity was plotted as a function of the S value, estimated from the position of the sedimentation markers. Enzymatic activities are expressed in arbitrary units, and one representative result is shown, n = 3. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By using the anti-PRiMA antibody in the Western blots, a band of ∼20 kDa was recognized in the extracts derived from C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes; the expression level was relatively higher in myoblasts (Fig. 2C, left). In addition, PRiMA was also detected in muscle (tibialis). Serving as a control, the brain extract showed similar band recognition. Again, the antibody recognition was blocked by PRiMA peptides in all cases (Fig. 2C, right). To understand the association of PRiMA with G4 AChE, the brain, muscle, and C2C12 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by anti-PRiMA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, the G4 AChE in the extracts was depleted by the antibody treatment with ∼70% depletion in brain, ∼40% depletion in muscle, and ∼40% depletion in cultured C2C12 cells. Clearly, the depletion was more robust in the brain extracts. The G1 enzyme in both cases was not affected by this antibody. These results suggest that a major part of G4 AChE in muscle is associated with PRiMA. The identity of the rest of G4 AChE was not further analyzed.A reduction in the expression of PRiMA may explain the reduction in G4 AChE during the myogenic differentiation process. According to Perrier et al. (27Perrier N.A. Kherif S. Perrier A.L. Dumas S. Mallet J. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1837-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), two splicing variants of PRiMA mRNAs are generated from the PRiMA gene to produce different proteins (PRiMA I and PRiMA II; Fig. 3A). PRiMA I mRNA possesses exons 4 and 5 and produces a 40-residue-long intracellular cytoplasmic tail, whereas PRiMA II mRNA possesses exons 4, 4b, and 5, resulting in a short intracellular motif (Fig. 3A). To differentiate these two PRiMA isoforms, reverse transcription-PCR was performed by specific primers located in exon 4 and exon 5. In C2C12 cultures, a large amount of PRiMA I was found, whereas PRiMA II was barely detectable (Fig. 3B). Similarly, both the tibialis (fast) and soleus (slow) muscles predominantly expressed PRiMA I (Fig. 3B). In adult rat brain, both isoforms of PRiMA exist, which means that rat brain can serve as a positive control, as reported previously (27Perrier N.A. Kherif S. Perrier A.L. Dumas S. Mallet J. Massoulié J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1837-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Reduction of PRiMA mRNA expression during myotube formation. A, genomic structure of the PRiMA gene shows the alternative splicing in forming PRiMA I and II. PRiMA II contains an additional exon, 4b, resulting in a short NQAI motif. B, total RNAs were extracted from cultures or tissues to perform reverse transcription-PCR analysis to determine the presence of PRiMA I (∼145 bp) and II (∼302 bp). Rat brain has both mRNAs. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (∼657 bp) served as controls in showing the equal loading of RNA. One of the representative results is shown, n = 3. C, quantitative real time PCR was performed to reveal the mRNA expressions of AChET and PRiMA I and II (as in B) in C2C12 during differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W1969918392,"Reduced DNA repair capability is associated with developing lung cancer, especially in nonsmokers. XPC participates in the initial recognition of DNA damage during the DNA nucleotide excision repair process. We hypothesize that inactivation of XPC by promoter hypermethylation may play an important role in the reduction of DNA repair capability to cause p53 mutation during lung carcinogenesis. In this report we demonstrate that hypermethylation of 17 CpG islands between -175 and -1 of the XPC promoter correlates very well with XPC expression levels in eight lung cancer cell lines. When cells with hypermethylated XPC promoters were treated with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, XPC expression was de-repressed. Interestingly, XPC hypermethylation was found in 4 of 5 (80%) lung cancer cell lines harbored p53 mutation, but not observed in two lung cancer cells which had a wild-type p53 gene. Among the analysis of the hypermethylation status of 158 lung tumors, XPC hypermethylation is more common in nonsmokers (39 of 94, 41%) than in smokers (14 of 64, 22%; P=0.010). Additionally, XPC hypermethylation is more often with G --> T or G --> C mutations in the p53 gene. To verify whether XPC inactivation is involved in the occurrence of p53 mutation, XPC gene of A549 cells was knockdown by a small interference RNA and then XPC-inactivated cells were treated with benzo[a]pynrene for different passages. Surprisingly, G --> T mutation in p53 gene at codon 215 was indeed detected in XPC-inactivated A549 cells of passages 15 and confirmed by loss of transcription activity of mdm2. These results show that hypermethylation of the XPC promoter may play a crucial role in XPC inactivation, which may partly contribute to the occurrence of p53 mutations during lung tumorigenesis, especially nonsmokers."
https://openalex.org/W2141424523,"Synphilin-1 is linked to Parkinson's disease (PD), based on its role as an alpha-synuclein (PARK1)-interacting protein and substrate of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin (PARK2) and because of its presence in Lewy bodies (LB) in brains of PD patients. We found that overexpression of synphilin-1 in cells leads to the formation of ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions supporting a derangement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in PD. We report here a novel specific interaction of synphilin-1 with the regulatory proteasomal protein S6 ATPase (tbp7). Functional characterization of this interaction on a cellular level revealed colocalization of S6 and synphilin-1 in aggresome-like intracytoplasmic inclusions. Overexpression of synphilin-1 and S6 in cells caused reduced proteasomal activity associated with a significant increase in inclusion formation compared to cells expressing synphilin-1 alone. Steady-state levels of synphilin-1 in cells were not altered after cotransfection of S6 and colocalization of synphilin-1-positive inclusions with lysosomal markers suggests the presence of an alternative lysosomal degradation pathway. Subsequent immunohistochemical studies in brains of PD patients identified S6 ATPase as a component of LB. This is the first study investigating the physiological role of synphilin-1 in the ubiquitin proteasome system. Our data suggest a direct interaction of synphilin-1 with the regulatory complex of the proteasome modulating proteasomal function."
https://openalex.org/W1996316841,"Noninvasive angiography using multislice computed tomography (MSCT) is superior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detection of coronary stenoses. We compared patient acceptance of these two noninvasive diagnostic tests and invasive conventional coronary angiography (Angio).A total of 111 consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease underwent MSCT, MRI, and Angio. Subsequently, patient acceptance of the three tests was evaluated with questionnaires in all patients. The main acceptance variables were preparation and information prior to the test, degree of concern, comfort, degree of helplessness, pain (on visual analog scales), willingness to undergo the test again, and overall satisfaction. Preparation for each test was not rated significantly differently, whereas patients were significantly more concerned about Angio than the two noninvasive tests (p<0.001). No pain during MSCT, MRI, and Angio as assessed on visual analog scales (0 to 100) was reported by 99, 93, and 31 patients, respectively. Among the 82 patients who felt pain during at least one procedure, both CT (0.9+/-4.5) and MRI (5.2+/-16.6) were significantly less painful than Angio (24.6+/-23.4, both p<0.001). MSCT was considered significantly more comfortable (1.49+/-0.64) than MRI (1.75+/-0.81, p<0.001). In both the no-revascularization (55 patients) and the revascularization group (56 patients), the majority of the patients (73 and 71%) would prefer MSCT to MRI and Angio for future imaging of the coronary arteries. None of the patients indicated to be unwilling to undergo MSCT again. The major advantages patients attributed to MSCT were its fast, uncomplicated, noninvasive, and painless nature.Noninvasive coronary angiography with MSCT is considered more comfortable than MRI and both MSCT and MRI are less painful than Angio. Patient preference for MSCT might tip the scales in favor of this test provided that the diagnostic accuracy of MSCT can be shown to be high enough for clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W1984545518,"The rapid reaction kinetics of wild-type xanthine dehydrogenase from Rhodobacter capsulatus and variants at Arg-310 in the active site have been characterized for a variety of purine substrates. With xanthine as substrate, kred (the limiting rate of enzyme reduction by substrate at high [S]) decreased ∼20-fold in an R310K variant and 2 × 104-fold in an R310M variant. Although Arg-310 lies on the opposite end of the substrate from the C-8 position that becomes hydroxylated, its interaction with substrate still contributed ∼4.5 kcal/mol toward transition state stabilization. The other purines examined fell into two distinct groups: members of the first were effectively hydroxylated by the wild-type enzyme but were strongly affected by the exchange of Arg-310 to methionine (with a reduction in kred greater than 103), whereas members of the second were much less effectively hydroxylated by wild-type enzyme but also much less significantly affected by the amino acid exchanges (with a reduction in kred less than 50-fold). The effect was such that the 4000-fold range in kred seen with wild-type enzyme was reduced to a mere 4-fold in the R310M variant. The data are consistent with a model in which “good” substrates are bound “correctly” in the active site in an orientation that allows Arg-310 to stabilize the transition state for the first step of the overall reaction via an electrostatic interaction at the C-6 position, thereby accelerating the reaction rate. On the other hand, “poor” substrates bound upside down relative to this “correct” orientation. In so doing, they are unable to avail themselves of the additional catalytic power provided by Arg-310 in wild-type enzyme but, for this reason, are significantly less affected by mutations at this position. The kinetic data thus provide a picture of the specific manner in which the physiological substrate xanthine is oriented in the active site relative to Arg-310 and how this residue is used catalytically to accelerate the reaction rate (rather than simply bind substrate) despite being remote from the position that is hydroxylated.

The molybdenum-containing hydroxylases represent a unique solution to the hydroxylation of carbon centers. Other monooxygenases introduce an oxygen atom derived from O2 and consume two reducing equivalents (along with the two removed from the substrate to be hydroxylated) in reducing O2 to water. The molybdenum enzymes, on the other hand, utilize water itself as the ultimate source of the oxygen atom incorporated into product. In the case of enzymes such as xanthine dehydrogenase, not only are molybdenum enzyme reducing equivalents not consumed in carrying out the catalyzed reaction, but in fact physiologically useful reducing equivalents in the form of NADH are generated. As such, these enzymes represent a unique solution to the chemistry of hydroxylation, and the requisite cleavage of a carbon-hydrogen bond that accompanies it (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). The xanthine dehydrogenase from Rhodobacter capsulatus is an (αβ)2 heterotetramer comprising two copies each of the XdhA and XdhB gene products (2Leimkühler S. Kern M. Solomon P.S. McEwan A.G.

XdhA possesses two different [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur clusters of the spinach ferredoxin variety as well as FAD, with each redox-active center located in a separately folded and contiguous domain of the polypeptide. XdhB possesses a molybdenum center with a square pyramidal LMoVIOS(OH) coordination sphere, with L representing a unique pyranopterin cofactor coordinated to the metal via an enedithiolate sidechain. This organic cofactor is common to all molybdenum- and tungsten-containing enzymes, with the sole exception of the multinuclear molybdenum- and iron-containing active site of nitrogenase (1Hille R. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2757-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). The structure of the R. capsulatus enzyme is known (3Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkühler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V.

Fetzner S. Huber R. Dobbek H. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1425-1435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)). The structure of the active site of the R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase is shown in Fig. 1. The molybdenum hydroxylases, which also include aldehyde oxidases from vertebrate, plant, and bacterial sources, are thought to share a common reaction mechanism, which has been best worked out in the case of the bovine enzyme (7Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romão M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 8Hille R.

Biophys. 2005; 433: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Catalysis is initiated by abstraction of a proton from the Mo-OH group by a universally conserved active site glutamate residue (7Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romão M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) followed by nucleophilic attack on the carbon center to be hydroxylated and concomitant hydride transfer to the Mo=S of the molybdenum center. This reaction yields an LMoIV(SH)(OR) intermediate, with OR representing the now hydroxylated product coordinated to the molybdenum via the newly introduced hydroxyl group. The catalytic sequence is completed by displacement of the bound product from the molybdenum coordination sphere by hydroxide from solvent, electron transfer out of the molybdenum center to the FAD (via the [2Fe-2S] centers), and deprotonation of the Mo-SH to give the original, oxidized LMoOS(OH) form of the center. The specific sequence of these latter events varies with the substrate used and the reaction conditions, but the LMoIV(SH)(OR) species is considered an obligatory intermediate. In addition to the glutamate residue thought to act as a general base, another highly conserved residue in the active site of the xanthine-utilizing enzymes (but not the aldehyde-utilizing ones) is Arg-310 (Arg-880 in the bovine enzyme) (Fig. 1). This residue lies some 10 Å from the molybdenum center, too far to participate directly in catalysis. In the structure of the enzyme with the mechanism-based inhibitor alloxanthine, however, Arg-310 is hydrogen-bonded to the back side of the heterocycle via one of the carbonyl groups of the latter (3Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkühler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Also, in a model of urate binding to reduced enzyme based on the crystal structure of the aldehyde oxidoreductase from Desulfovibrio gigas (7Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romão M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), the equivalent Arg is suggested to interact similarly with bound product. In the present work, we examined the catalytic role of Arg-310 and found, surprisingly, that its exchange to methionine results in a 20000-fold decrease in kred (the limiting rate of enzyme reduction upon mixing with substrate). Thus, ∼4.5 kcal/mol of the free energy available to the enzyme from its interaction with substrate is used to accelerate reaction rate rather than to stabilize the E·S complex. An analysis of the reaction of wild-type and R310M or R310K enzymes with a series of other purine substrates provides information on how substrate orients itself in the active site for effective catalysis. Protein Purification—Recombinant R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase was purified using the procedure described by Leimkühler et al. (11Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with affinity chromatography on a Sepharose 4B/folate gel as the final step. By using PCR mutagenesis, amino acid exchanges R310M and R310K were introduced into R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase. The generated variants were expressed under the same conditions as the wild-type enzyme and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetate chromatography, Q-Sepharose, and size exclusion chromatography. The purified enzymes were concentrated by ultrafiltration, gel-filtered using a PD-10 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, pH 7.5, and stored at -70 °C until used. The iron content of wild-type xanthine dehydrogenase and the R310M and R310K variants was determined to be in a range of 93 to 95%, whereas the molybdenum content varied for the proteins: 99% for wild-type xanthine dehydrogenase, 67% for the R310M variant, and 50% for the R310K variant, as analyzed by ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer Optima, DV2100). The levels of molybdenum saturation correspond well with the amount of the pterin cofactor present in the enzymes as determined by conversion to Form A described previously (11Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The wild-type enzyme was determined to be approximately 80% active. Enzyme Assays and Rapid Reaction Kinetics—Routine enzyme assays were carried out as described previously (10Leimkühler S. Stockert A.L. Igarishi K. Nishino T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4037-4044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar) at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, monitoring the absorbance change at 340 nm due to reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The enzyme concentration was determined from the absorbance at 465 nm using an extinction coefficient of 31.6 mm-1 cm-1 (11Leimkühler S. Hodson R. George G.N. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20802-20811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reductive half-reaction experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions using an Applied Photophysics SX-18MV kinetic spectrophotometer with a 1-cm observation path length. Standard reaction conditions were 20 mm Tris, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.8, at 4 °C. In a typical experiment, enzyme at a concentration of 12–14 μm was mixed with an equal volume of substrate solution, the latter at concentrations ranging from 20 μm to 2.0 mm. The reaction was monitored at 460 and 620 nm over an appropriate time scale, and the observed kinetic transients fit to exponentials to obtain kobs. For those substrates for which kobs varied with substrate concentration, kobs was then plotted against substrate concentration to obtain kred, the limiting rate of reduction at high [S], and the dissociation constant Kd. For those substrates (e.g. 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine, as seen previously with the bovine enzyme (12McWhirter R.B. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23724-23731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) for which kobs did not vary, the average of the observed values was taken as kred. Tris hydrochloride was from Fisher Scientific. Xanthine, 1-methylxanthine, 2-thioxanthine, and 6-thioxanthine were from Sigma, 2,6-diaminopurine from Aldrich, and 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine from the Sigma-Aldrich Library of Rare Chemicals. Other reagents were of the highest purity available commercially and were used without further purification. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Arg-310 of R. capsulatus Xanthine Dehydrogenase—Both active site residues Glu-232 and Glu-730 in the R. capsulatus enzyme have been shown to be important for catalysis. Glu-730 is thought to act as an active site base in the initial step of the reaction, and its mutation to an alanine reduces the limiting rate of enzyme reduction by substrate by a factor of at least 107. Glu-232 is involved in both substrate binding and transition state stabilization, as its mutation to alanine results in a 10-fold decrease in kred and a 10-fold increase in Kd (10Leimkühler S. Stockert A.L. Igarishi K. Nishino T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4037-4044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of Arg-310 for R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase, the variants R310K and R310M were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The absorption spectra of the purified variants were very similar to the wild-type enzyme, and the difference seen in the region around 320 nm is due to a rather lower Mo=S content of the mutated proteins (Fig. 2A). The amino acid exchanges were chosen on the basis of amino acid alignment of xanthine- and aldehyde-utilizing enzymes, which showed that these proteins share an identity of 50%. There are some differences in the cofactor binding domain between xanthine- and aldehyde-utilizing enzymes, and the highly conserved residues Glu-232 and Arg-310 (R. capsulatus numbering) involved in substrate binding in the R. capsulatus enzyme are typically exchanged to valine and methionine, respectively, in aldehyde oxidases (Fig. 2B). The x-ray structure of R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase with alloxanthine at the active site showed that Arg-310 forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom of the 6-position of alloxanthine (corresponding to the 2-position of xanthine). Thus we wanted to investigate the effects of an exchange of arginine to lysine and methionine on substrate binding and determine the catalytic constants. The Reaction of Wild-type R. capsulatus Xanthine Dehydrogenase and R310K/R310M Variants with Xanthine—The reductive half-reaction of wild-type R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase exhibits a hyperbolic dependence of the observed rate constant on substrate concentration, yielding at 4 °C values for kred and Kd of 29 s- and 25 μm, respectively, with a value for kred/Kd of 1.2 × 106m-1 s-1, in reasonable agreement with previous work (10Leimkühler S. Stockert A.L. Igarishi K. Nishino T. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4037-4044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Upon substitution of Arg-310 with lysine, the corresponding values are 1.6 s-1, 45 μm and 3.7 × 104m-1 s-1, indicating that this conservative mutation significantly compromises but does not abolish the catalytic power of the enzyme. Mutation to methionine, on the other hand, reduces kred to 0.0017 s-1, a reduction of more than 104 from the value seen with the wild-type enzyme. In the case of the R310M variant, no substrate concentration dependence of the observed rate constant was seen over the range of 20 μm to 2.0 mm, as has been observed previously with the slow substrate 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine with bovine xanthine oxidase (12McWhirter R.B. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23724-23731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This contrasting behavior of the wild-type enzyme and R310M variant notwithstanding, it is evident from a comparison of kred values alone that Arg-310 contributes ∼4.5 kcal/mol toward transition state stabilization in the wild-type enzyme. As indicated in Table 1, the R310K variant was generally more active than the R310M variant for a variety of purine substrates, indicating that retaining the positive charge at position 310 gave rise to considerably less dramatic consequences on the kinetic behavior of the enzyme. It is thus evident that a positively charged residue at position 310 leads to significant transition state stabilization in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction.TABLE 1Rapid reaction kinetic parameters for wild-type R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase and R310K and R310M variantsSubstrateWild typeR310KR310MkredKdkred/KdkredKdkred/KdkredKdkred/Kds–1μm×106s–1μm×106s–1μm×106Xanthine67.3aFrom Ref. 1033.6aFrom Ref. 102.00aFrom Ref. 1029.3 ± 1.0bPresent work24.9 ± 4.0bPresent work1.18bPresent work1.63 ± 0.0544.7 ± 6.00.03650.00219 ± 0.0005NDcND, not determinedND2-Thioxanthine14.49 ± 0.840.89 ± 10.00.3540.037 ± 0.00646.33 ± 40.00.0007990.00167 ± 0.0005NDND6-Thioxanthine22.36 ± 0.724.10 ± 4.00.9281.26 ± 0.029.43 ± 1.00.1340.00540 ± 0.000215.05 ± 3.00.0003591-Methylxanthine2.65 ± 0.0777.80 ± 8.00.03410.0135 ± 0.005NDND0.00547 ± 0.002NDND2,6-Diaminopurine0.00745 ± 0.001NDND0.0161 ± 0.00131.88 ± 10.00.0005050.00640 ± 0.002NDND2-Hydroxy-0.218 ± 0.02dGlobal fit of diode array detector data set using two kinetic stepsNDND0.837 ± 0.0410.66 ± 5.00.07850.00175 ± 0.0006NDND6-Methylpurine0.168 ± 0.003eGlobal fit of diode array detector data set using one kinetic step9.52 ± 1.00.01760.775 ± 0.0427.26 ± 7.40.0284a From Ref. 10Leimkühler S.

As seen in Fig. 3, however, a positive charge in the vicinity of the C-6 position is expected to resonance-stabilize the negative charge accumulating on the ring as a result of nucleophilic attack at C-8. As discussed further below, the fact that this stabilization occurs at C-6 rather than C-2 has implications regarding the orientation of substrate in the active site for productive catalysis. The Reaction of Additional Purine Substrates with Wild-type Xanthine Dehydrogenase—In addition to xanthine, we also examined the reaction of R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase with 1-methylxanthine, 2-thioxanthine, 6-thioxanthine, 2,6-diaminopurine, and 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine, compounds for which the structures are shown in Fig. 4. These purines were selected taking into consideration that xanthine dehydrogenase is also able to hydroxylate at C-2 and C-6 as well as C-8, when these positions are available; each member of the present set is substituted in such a way that it can only be hydroxylated at the C-8 position (as is xanthine), and as such they constitute a proper homologous series in which to examine substrate specificity. The results of this kinetic study are tabulated in Table 1. Both 2- and 6-thioxanthine were found to be effective substrates for the R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase, with kred and Kd values comparable with those seen with xanthine. These two thio derivatives have also previously been found to be effective substrates for bovine xanthine oxidase (13Stockert A.L. Shinde S. Anderson R.F. Hille R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14554-14555Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). By contrast, 1-methylxanthine, a good substrate for the bovine enzyme, exhibits a 10-fold reduced kred and 2-fold increased Kd with the R. capsulatus enzyme. Although it is among the best substrates for the bovine enzyme (13Stockert A.L. Shinde S. Anderson R.F. Hille R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14554-14555Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is rather less effective than xanthine as a substrate for the R. capsulatus enzyme. On the other hand, 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine and especially 2,6-diaminopurine are manifestly poorer substrates than xanthine (or either of the thio derivatives) for the wild-type R. capsulatus enzyme, with kred values of 0.17 s-1 and 0.007 s-1, respectively. The Reaction of Additional Purine Substrates with the R310K and R310M Variants of R. capsulatus Xanthine Dehydrogenase— The trend seen with xanthine as substrate was generally observed for the other purines used in this study, with reactivity moderately reduced in the R310K variant and significantly reduced in the R310M variant. The exception was seen with 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine, where the R310K variant was actually modestly more active than the wild-type enzyme, by a factor of ∼4. Interestingly, there was a very small range of values for kred for the R310M variant with the substrates used, a factor of only 4 as compared with 4000 for wild-type enzyme (or 13,000 for the wild-type bovine enzyme (13Stockert A.L. Shinde S. Anderson R.F. Hille R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14554-14555Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)). Evidently, Arg-310 plays a significant role in substrate selectivity among the purines. Most of the substrates (excepting 2,6-diaminopurine) yielded a typical hyperbolic dependence of kobs versus [S] with wild-type enzyme, whereas most (excepting 6-thioxanthine) exhibited no substrate concentration dependence of the observed rate constant over the range of 20 μm to 2.0 mm with the R310M variant. On the basis of the experiments described above, it is evident that the substrates investigated herein fall broadly into two groups: members of the first are effective substrates of the wild-type enzyme and are hydroxylated significantly less effectively by the R310M variant, whereas members of the second are poor substrates of the wild-type enzyme but are much less affected by mutation of Arg-310 to methionine. Included in the first group is the physiological substrate xanthine, in which hydroxylation proceeds more than 104-fold more slowly in the variant than in the wild-type enzyme. Given that Arg-310 is quite removed from the site where hydroxylation occurs, it is interesting that kred is affected to the extent that it is upon mutation of Arg-310 to methionine. It is evident that a considerable amount of the free energy available to the enzyme from the favorable interaction of this residue with substrate (some 4.5 kcal/mol) is used not to stabilize the E·S complex but instead to stabilize the transition state, thereby accelerating the reaction. How this likely occurs is illustrated in Fig. 3, where it can be seen that interaction of Arg-310 with the C-6 carbonyl group of substrate stabilizes negative charge accumulation on the heterocycle that accompanies nucleophilic attack at C-8. Effective neutralization of negative charge accumulation on substrate in the course of the reaction is best achieved if substrate binds in the active site with the orientation shown in Fig. 3, with the C6=O carbonyl in a position to interact with Arg-310. In the crystal structure of the reduced R. capsulatus enzyme with the tight-binding inhibitor alloxanthine, however, it is the carbonyl equivalent to C2=O of xanthine (somewhat confusingly, the numbering convention of heterocycles is such that the equivalent carbonyl of alloxanthine is designated C6=O (14Massey V. Komai H. Palmer G. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) that interacts with Arg-310 (3Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkühler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is important to recognize, however, that in the complex with reduced enzyme, alloxanthine sits ∼2 Å closer to the molybdenum than does nascent product in the course of the reaction, because alloxanthine coordinates directly to the molybdenum via N-8 of its pyrazole ring, whereas the C-8 position of nascent product is bridged to the metal via the hydroxyl oxygen that is introduced catalytically (Fig. 5). Being somewhat further removed from the molybdenum, it is possible that the catalytically preferred orientation of substrate is in fact inverted relative to the orientation seen crystallographically in the alloxanthine complex. Indeed, a model for urate bound to xanthine oxidoreductase based on the structure of the D. gigas aldehyde oxidoreductase (which, unusually among the aldehyde-utilizing enzymes, possesses Arg at position 504, equivalent to Arg-310 in the R. capsulatus enzyme) has Arg-504 interacting with the C6=O rather than C2=O carbonyl group of the docked product (7Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romão M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). 3In generating this model, it was necessary to exchange Phe-425 in the structure of the D. gigas enzyme to a Glu and to assume that the hydroxyl groups of Tyr-535 and Tyr-622, which are both phenylalanine in the xanthine-utilizing enzymes, do not alter the mode of substrate binding. It is further to be noted that Tyr-622 of the D. gigas enzyme, which was not shown in the original model (7Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romão M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), occupies a significantly different orientation relative to the molybdenum center than does the corresponding Phe-459 (Phe-1009 in bovine) in the subsequently determined R. capsulatus and bovine structures. For these reasons, the orientation with C6=O interacting with Arg-310 more likely represents that of substrate at the outset of catalysis. Considering now the two poorest substrates for the wild-type enzyme, 2,6-diaminopurine and 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine, an examination of their structures indicates that neither will be able to interact effectively with Arg-310 via their 6-positions (occupied by an amino group and a methyl group, respectively). It is thus possible that the low reactivity of these nonphysiological substrates is due to their binding in an inverted orientation relative to xanthine. Were this the case, then the catalytic power deriving from Arg-310 would be lost, but as is in fact observed, there would be relatively little effect upon loss of the arginine upon mutation to methionine because the arginine was not contributing to catalysis in the first place. The data thus suggest that the difference in reactivity of the two groups of substrate is because of their different orientations in the active site. An additional observation regarding the reductive half-reaction of the R310M variant is worth a brief mention. With each of the substrates shown in Fig. 4, the reaction with the R310M variant as followed at 460 nm exhibited an initial absorbance decrease followed by a rise before the subsequent loss of absorption that made up the majority of the absorbance change. The effect was most pronounced at high substrate concentrations, although the specific concentration at which this behavior became pronounced varied from one substrate to the next. The initial absorbance decrease was always only a very small fraction of the total absorbance change observed in the course of a given transient (less than 5%), yet was distinct enough to suggest the possibility of intermediate formation in the mechanism of this mutated form of xanthine dehydrogenase. This phenomenon is currently under further investigation. In conclusion, in the present work we have demonstrated that the active site Arg-310 of R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase plays an important role in catalysis, contributing ∼4.5 kcal/mol toward transition state stabilization and accounting for a 2 × 104-fold increase in rate acceleration. Arg-310 is positioned in the active site well away from the molybdenum center and the C-8 position of substrate that is hydroxylated, but it apparently lowers the activation energy for the reaction by stabilizing negative charge accumulation on the heterocycle through an electrostatic interaction with the C6 carbonyl oxygen of substrate. This in turn implies that substrate binds in the opposite orientation to that seen in the structure of the (reduced) enzyme in complex with the mechanism-based inhibitor alloxanthine (but like that seen in the model of urate bound to the D. gigas aldehyde oxidoreductase (7Huber R. Hof P. Duarte R.O. Moura J.J.G. Moura I. LeGall J. Hille R. Archer M. Romão M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8846-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar)). This conclusion is supported by the results of a kinetic study utilizing a homologous series of purines; those that are effective substrates of the wild-type enzyme, presumably binding in an orientation similar to xanthine and making use of the catalytic contribution of Arg-310, are strongly affected by the exchange of Arg-310 to methionine, whereas those that react most slowly with enzyme (2,6-diaminopurine and 2-hydroxy-6-methylpurine) have functional groups at position 6 (amino and methyl, respectively) that prevent interaction with Arg-310. We suggest that these substrates bind in an inverted orientation to that seen with xanthine, accounting for their low reactivity. Because these purines are not able to take advantage of transition state stabilization by Arg-310 in wild-type enzyme, they are expected to be less sensitive to its mutation to methionine, as was in fact observed. The disparity in reaction rate among the purine substrates used here with the R310M variant is 1000-fold less extensive than with the wild-type enzyme, indicating that Arg-310 plays a significant role in determining the substrate specificity of xanthine dehydrogenase. Finally, it is worth noting that the catalytic role for Arg-310 proposed here also provides an explanation as to why the arginine is not generally conserved in the aldehyde oxidases, because with these enzymes negative charge accumulation is expected to be restricted to the carbonyl oxygen of substrate, much nearer the molybdenum center. Addendum—Since our manuscript was submitted, Nishino and co-workers (16Yamaguchi Y. Matsumura T. Ichida K. Okamoto K. Nishino T. J. Biochem. February 14, 2007; 10.1093/jb/mvm053Google Scholar) have reported the properties of several mutants of human xanthine oxidoreductase, including an R881M mutant analogous to the R310M mutant considered here with the R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase. By steady-state kinetic analysis, these authors find no detectable activity in the mutant, consistent with our observation here that kred is reduced by a factor of 20,000. Interestingly, and in contrast with the bacterial enzyme, 4S. Leimkühler, unpublished data. these workers find that activity toward benzaldehyde as substrate is only moderately affected by the mutation in the human enzyme. We thank Antje Schulte for construction of the xanthine dehydrogenase variant R310M."
https://openalex.org/W2014091091,"We have reported previously that PDK1 physically interacts with STRAP, a transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor-interacting protein, and enhances STRAP-induced inhibition of TGF-β signaling. In this study we show that PDK1 coimmunoprecipitates with Smad proteins, including Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7, and that this association is mediated by the pleckstrin homology domain of PDK1. The association between PDK1 and Smad proteins is increased by insulin treatment but decreased by TGF-β treatment. Analysis of the interacting proteins shows that Smad proteins enhance PDK1 kinase activity by removing 14-3-3, a negative regulator of PDK1, from the PDK1-14-3-3 complex. Knockdown of endogenous Smad proteins, including Smad3 and Smad7, by transfection with small interfering RNA produced the opposite trend and decreased PDK1 activity, protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation, and Bad phosphorylation. Moreover, coexpression of Smad proteins and wild-type PDK1 inhibits TGF-β-induced transcription, as well as TGF-β-mediated biological functions, such as apoptosis and cell growth arrest. Inhibition was dose-dependent on PDK1, but no inhibition was observed in the presence of an inactive kinase-dead PDK1 mutant. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that wild-type PDK1 prevents translocation of Smad3 and Smad4 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, as well as the redistribution of Smad7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TGF-β. Taken together, our results suggest that PDK1 negatively regulates TGF-β-mediated signaling in a PDK1 kinase-dependent manner via a direct physical interaction with Smad proteins and that Smad proteins can act as potential positive regulators of PDK1. We have reported previously that PDK1 physically interacts with STRAP, a transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor-interacting protein, and enhances STRAP-induced inhibition of TGF-β signaling. In this study we show that PDK1 coimmunoprecipitates with Smad proteins, including Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7, and that this association is mediated by the pleckstrin homology domain of PDK1. The association between PDK1 and Smad proteins is increased by insulin treatment but decreased by TGF-β treatment. Analysis of the interacting proteins shows that Smad proteins enhance PDK1 kinase activity by removing 14-3-3, a negative regulator of PDK1, from the PDK1-14-3-3 complex. Knockdown of endogenous Smad proteins, including Smad3 and Smad7, by transfection with small interfering RNA produced the opposite trend and decreased PDK1 activity, protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation, and Bad phosphorylation.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The diverse cellular responses elicited by TGF-β are triggered by activation of TGF-β receptors (type I and II), which are serine/threonine kinases. TGF-β receptors subsequently propagate signals through phosphorylation of intracellular signaling mediators referred to as Smads (3Piek E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 4Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 5Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are three functional classes of Smad proteins (6Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), the common Smads (Co-Smads), and the inhibitory Smads (I-Smads). The R-Smads are directly phosphorylated and activated by the type I TGF-β receptor and undergo homotrimerization and heterodimerization with a Co-Smad (Smad 4). The activated heteromeric Smad complexes are translocated into the nucleus and cooperate with other nuclear cofactors to regulate the transcription of target genes (7Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4739) Google Scholar). Smad-mediated signaling may be simple but it is under the control of a number of Smad-interacting proteins. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated the existence of cellular Smad regulators that interact with Smads to control the subcellular localization and the rate of R-Smad association with the TGF-β receptor and subsequent phosphorylation at the plasma membrane or in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Several of these Smad regulators have been identified, including the FYVE domain protein SARA (8Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L.

Thus, identification and characterization of additional Smad-interacting molecules should provide greater insight into the regulation of Smad-mediated signaling. In addition, growth factor- and insulin-mediated signaling pathways modulate TGF-β signaling through a physical interaction between PKB/Akt and Smad3 (17Remy I. Montmarquette A. Michnick S.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible cross-talk between TGF-β- and PI3K/PDK1-mediated signaling pathways.The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is a member of the protein kinase A, G, and C subfamily of protein kinases with a PH domain that binds phosphoinositides such as PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 for its activity and phosphorylates Thr-308 of PKB/Akt. Phosphorylation on both Thr-308 and Ser-473 is required for maximal activation of PKB/Akt (18Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P.

Emerging evidence indicates that PDK1 kinase activity is controlled by several cellular proteins that interact with PDK1, including Hsp90 (21Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol.

These observations strongly suggest that the PDK1-interacting proteins can regulate PDK1 activity. In this study, we show that there are direct physical and functional interactions between PDK1 and Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7) and that these interactions may play an important role in the regulation of both the PDK1 and Smad activities involved in PI3K/PDK1- and TGF-β-mediated signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Plasmids—293T, HepG2, Hep3B, HaCaT, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).

After culturing overnight, the transfected cells were incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (100 pm) for 20 h. Cells were then washed and solubilized with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 as described (27Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Detergent-insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation, and the cleared lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and then washed three times with the lysis buffer. For Western blotting, coprecipitates or whole cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were incubated with protein A-Sepharose that had been conjugated to the appropriate antibodies (anti-Myc, anti-PDK1, anti-Smad3, anti-Smad4, anti-Akt, and anti-Bad). The immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies and then developed using an ECL detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).PDK1 Kinase Assay—To estimate PDK1-dependent serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) phosphorylation in vitro, 293T cells transiently transfected with the appropriate plasmids were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized with 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.3 m NaCl). The cleared lysates were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the precipitate three times with lysis buffer, and then twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2), the precipitate was incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of kinase buffer containing 500 ng of recombinant SGK (Upstate). The reactions were separated by electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Treatment—siRNAs and their complementary RNA strands were synthesized by SamChully Pharm. Ltd. (Seoul, Korea). The sequences used were as follows: PDK1 siRNA(a) targeting a coding region (amino acids 420-425) of the human PDK1 (24Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 7264-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (5′-GCGCGGGGCACGUUGGUGUTT-3′). The sense and antisense oligonucleotides for each siRNA were mixed and heated at 90 °C for 2 min, annealed at 30 °C for 1 h, and transfected into 293T, Hep3B, HaCaT, or HeLa cells using the WelFect-Ex™ Plus method. Cell lysates were collected 48 h post-transfection and analyzed by immunoblottings to confirm the down-regulation of target proteins.Luciferase Reporter Assay—HepG2 cells were transfected using WelFect-Ex™ Plus with the p3TP-Lux or p21-Luc reporter plasmids, along with each expression vector as indicated. The cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the Promega dual luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Light emission was determined with a VICTOR™ luminometer (1420 luminescence counter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The total DNA concentration was kept constant by supplementing with empty vector DNA. The data were normalized to the expression levels of a cotransfected β-galactosidase reporter control, and experiments were repeated at least four times.Cell Death Assay—The number of HeLa or HaCaT cells undergoing apoptosis after treatment with TGF-β1 (HeLa, 10 ng/ml for 20 h; HaCaT, 2 ng/ml for 20 h) was quantified using the GFP system, as described previously (24Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells grown on sterile coverslips were transfected with pEGFP, an expression vector encoding GFP, together with the indicated expression vectors. The cells were treated with TGF-β1, at 24 h post-transfection. The cells were fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol, washed three times with PBS, and then stained with a bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258). The coverslips were washed with PBS, then mounted on glass slides using Gelvatol, and visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM IRB, Germany). The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei divided by the total number of GFP-positive cells.Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vectors containing Smad3 and Smad4 were constructed by subcloning the cDNA fragments of Smad3 and Smad4 into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (25Jung H. Kim T. Chae H.-Z. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15504-15510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).FACS Analysis—HaCaT cells (2 × 105/60-mm dish) transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmid vectors (empty vector, PDK1, Smad3, and Smad7) and siRNA duplexes (Smad3, Smad7, PDK1, and control siRNAs) were washed with ice-cold PBS and then synchronized in G0/G1 by treating with hydroxyurea (2 mm) for 20 h. The fraction of cells in each stage of the cell cycle was analyzed after 10% serum treatment for 24 h in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml). Trypsinized cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with a solution (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 1 mg/ml RNase A. The cells in each phase of the cell cycle were identified using the Mod-FitLT version 3.0 (PMac) program. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using FACSCalibur-S system (BD Biosciences).Indirect Immunofluorescence—Hep3B cells were plated and transfected with FLAG-Smads (Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7) and/or Myc-tagged wild-type and kinase-dead PDK1 constructs on sterile coverslips, placed on ice, and washed three times with ice-cold PBS prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS, treated with 0.2% Triton X-100, and rewashed with PBS. The cells were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG (M2), diluted 1:1000 in PBS, or rabbit anti-Myc, diluted 1:200 in PBS, for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor-594 anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor-488 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, diluted 1:1000 in PBS, at 37 °C for 1 h. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and then mounted on glass slides using Gelvatol. Proteins were visualized using a Leica Dmire2 confocal microscopy (Germany).RESULTSIdentification of PDK1 as a Smad-interacting Protein—We have found previously that STRAP, a TGF-β receptor interacting protein, physically interacts with PDK1 in mammalian cells (24Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, STRAP inhibits TGF-β signaling by stabilizing the TGF-β receptor-Smad7 complex, and STRAP itself binds to Smad proteins such as Smad2, Smad3, and Smad7 (29Datta P.K. Moses H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we reasoned that PDK1 might interact with Smad proteins, as well as with STRAP, in intact cells. To examine whether PDK1 directly binds to Smad proteins, we performed in vivo binding assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments using overexpressed or endogenous proteins in 293T cells. The interaction of FLAG-tagged Smad proteins with a Myc-PDK1 fusion protein was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. Smad2, -3, -4, and -7 were detected in the immunoprecipitate when coexpressed with Myc-PDK1 (Fig. 1A), indicating that PDK1 physically interacts with Smad proteins in cells. To confirm the interaction of PDK1 with Smad proteins in vivo, we next performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with endogenous PDK1 and exogenous FLAG-tagged Smad proteins (Fig. 1B). Endogenous PDK1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PDK1 antibody from cell lysates, and the binding of Smad proteins was subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. Smad proteins were present in the PDK1 immunoprecipitate (upper panel), but not in immunoprecipitates from control lysates of cells transfected with empty vector alone (CMV). Moreover, to examine the interaction between the two endogenous proteins, immunoprecipitation of endogenous PDK1 using an anti-PDK1 antibody was performed, and the binding of the endogenous Smad proteins (Smad2, -3, and -7) was subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated anti-Smad antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, endogenous PDK1 physically interacted with the endogenous Smad proteins used in 293T cells. We have further analyzed this association using other cell lines, including Hep3B cells and SK-N-BE2C cells (27Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a human neuroblastoma line, and we confirmed that this association could occur in vivo (data not shown). To determine whether the Smad proteins can be substrates for PDK1 in vitro, recombinant Smad proteins (re.Smad3 and -4) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified and then used as substrates in a PDK1 kinase assay. Extracts from 293T cells expressing GST-PDK1 and FLAG-STRAP were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP to allow phosphorylation of the recombinant Smad proteins. As shown in Fig. 1D, the Smad proteins were phosphorylated by PDK1 when the in vitro kinase assays were performed using re.Smad3 and -4 as substrates. However, phosphorylation of the recombinant Smad proteins was not detected in the absence of PDK1 (data not shown). In addition, we observed that the coexpression of STRAP, a potential positive regulator of PDK1 (24Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), significantly increased the phosphorylation of Smad proteins by PDK1 (Fig. 1D, 2nd versus 3rd lane and 4th versus 5th lane). Similar results showing that the Smad proteins can be phosphorylated by PDK1 were also observed in vivo using cells coexpressing PDK1 and Smad2, -3, -4, or -7 instead of the recombinant Smad proteins (data not shown). To further confirm that the phosphorylation of Smad proteins by PDK1 occurs in vivo, we compared PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3/4 in cells expressing wild-type (WT) PDK1 or a kinase-dead (KD) PDK1 mutant or in the presence of a PDK1 siRNA. Expression of wild-type PDK1 produced a higher level of Smad3/4 phosphorylation, compared with cells expressing either kinase-dead PDK1 or a PDK1-specific siRNA (Fig. 1E). Taken together, our results indicate that PDK1 directly interacts with Smad proteins in vivo and that Smad proteins can be substrates for PDK1.Mapping of the PDK1 and Smad Protein Domains Involved in the PDK1-Smad Complex Formation—To establish which regions of PDK1 are necessary for association with the Smad proteins, we generated two PDK1 deletion constructs FLAG-PDK1(PH), comprising the carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (amino acids 411-556), and FLAG-PDK1(CA), harboring the catalytic domain (amino acids 67-359), as described previously (24Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and we examined whether these constructs were able to interact with Smad proteins. Wild-type FLAG-PDK1 and FLAG-PDK1(PH), which lacks the catalytic domain of PDK1, interacted with Smad2, -3, -4, and -7 when the proteins were coexpressed in 293T cells (Fig. 2A). However, FLAG-PDK1(CA), which contains only the catalytic domain, was unable to do so (Fig. 2A, top panel), indicating that the interaction with Smad proteins is mediated via the carboxyl-terminal PH domain of PDK1. Next, to examine which region of Smad3 was required for binding of PDK1 in vivo, we generated four FLAG-tagged Smad3 deletion constructs (Fig. 2B, upper panel). The FLAG-MH1 (amino acids 1-136), FLAG-MH1(L) (amino acids 1-231), FLAG-MH2 (amino acids 231-425), and FLAG-MH2(L) (amino acids 136-425) constructs were expressed in 293T cells and used for in vivo binding assays with GST-PDK1. The binding of PDK1 to the Smad3 deletion constructs (MH1(L), MH2, and MH2(L)) was readily detectable (Fig. 2B, lower top panel). However, PDK1 binding to the MH1 construct was not detected (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the PDK1 PH domain binds to the Smad3 Linker/MH2 region.FIGURE 2Mapping of the binding site involved in PDK1-Smad complex formation. A, mapping of PDK1 domains involved in Smads binding. The structure of the WT PDK1 is depicted with the relative locations of its catalytic domain (CA) and PH domain. The numbers indicate amino acid residues, and the amino acid numbers of the domain boundaries are indicated (upper panel). 293T cells were cotransfected with GST alone or GST-Smads (Smad2, -3, -4, and -7), together with FLAG-PDK1(WT), FLAG-PDK1(CA), and FLAG-PDK1(PH), and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GST purification). The amount of PDK1(PH) and PDK1(WT) bound to Smad proteins was determined by Western blot (WB) analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody (lower, top panel). The same stripped blot was re-probed with an anti-GST antibody to determine the expression of GST fusion proteins in the coprecipitates (lower, middle panel), and the expression of FLAG-tagged PDK1 protein in total cell lysates was analyzed by Western analysis using the anti-FLAG antibody (lower, bottom panel, Lysate). B, mapping of Smad3 domains involved in PDK1 binding. 293T cells were transiently transfected with vector alone (GST), or GST-PDK1, in combination with the indicated FLAG-Smad3 deletion constructs, FLAG-MH1, FLAG-MH1(L), FLAG-MH2, and FLAG-MH2(L), and cell lysates were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GST purification). The complex formation between PDK1 and Smad3 deletion constructs was determined by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG antibody (lower, top panel). Expression levels of FLAG-Smad3 deletion constructs were confirmed by Western blot analysis of total cell extracts using the anti-FLAG antibody (lower, bottom panel). These experiments were independently performed at least four times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PDK1-Smads Complex Formation Is Regulated by Insulin and TGF-β—We"
https://openalex.org/W2013615819,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to be activated by specific ligands as well as other cellular stimuli including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In the present study, we found that cellular stress suppressed ligand-mediated EGFR activity. Both TNF-α and osmotic stress rapidly induced phosphorylation of EGFR. This phosphorylation of EGFR and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and NF-κB occurred independently of the shedding of extracellular membrane-bound EGFR ligands and intracellular EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. Transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) was involved in the TNF-α-induced signaling pathway to EGFR. In addition, experiments using chemical inhibitors and small interfering RNA demonstrated that p38α is a common mediator for the cellular stress-induced phosphorylation of EGFR. Surprisingly, the modified EGFR was not able to respond to its extracellular ligand due to transient internalization through the clathrin-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, turnover of p38 activation led to dephosphorylation and recycling back to the cell surface of EGFR. These results demonstrated that TNF-α has opposite bifunctional activities in modulating the function of the EGFR.

However, little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways leading to ADAM-mediated transactivation of the EGFR.Cellular stress stimulates several intracellular signaling pathways leading to activation of the transcription factors activator protein-1 and NF-κB (36Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2851) Google Scholar). Activator protein-1 is regulated by cascades of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 pathways (37Johnson G.L.

Sakurai H. Matsuo M. Choo M.K. Koizumi K. Saiki I. Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 92: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). TNF-α-induced cellular responses, such as the activation of MAPK, expression of integrin, and invasion are also regulated by the ADAM-mediated transactivation of EGFR. In the present study, we found that TNF-α actually suppressed the ligand-mediated activation of EGFR via TAK1-p38-mediated signaling in HeLa cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—An anti-phospho-TAK1 (Thr-187) antibody was generated as described previously (40Singhirunnusorn P. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Saiki I. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7359-7368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Other phosphospecific antibodies against p38, JNK, ERK, p65, S6K, and EGFR (Tyr-845, -1045, -1068, and -1173) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against TAK1 (M-579), p38 (C-20-G), JNK (FL), ERK1 (C-16), ERK2 (C-14), p65 (C-20-G), EGFR (1005), c-Cbl (C-15), clathrin heavy chain (C-20), Cbl-b (C-20) and Actin (C-11) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A neutralizing anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (clone LA1, mouse IgG1) and isotype control IgG1 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and R & D Systems, respectively. Recombinant human TNF-α and EGF were obtained from R & D Systems, SB203580, SP600125, U0126, SC-514, GM6001, PD153035, and AG825 from Merck Biosciences, and recombinant human p38α, a TAK1-TAB1 fusion protein, and λ-phosphatase from Upstate Biotechnology. 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, a selective TAK1 inhibitor, was a gift from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. All of the chemical inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO, and the final concentration of Me2SO was <0.1%.Cell Cultures—HeLa and A549 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Transfection of Small Interfering RNAs—Duplex small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with two nucleotides overhanging at the 3′ end of the sequence were designed at iGENE Therapeutics and synthesized at Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd. The target sequences for TAK1, p38α, clathrin heavy chain, c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and firefly luciferase (GL2) were reported previously (14Huang F. Kirkpatrick D. Jiang X. Gygi S. Sorkin A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 40Singhirunnusorn P. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Saiki I. Sakurai H. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with the siRNAs in a final concentration of 25–50 nm using Lipofectamine reagents. At 72 h post-transfection, the cells were stimulated.Phosphatase and Kinase Reactions—EGFR immunoprecipitated from untreated or TNF-α-stimulated HeLa cells were incubated with λ-phosphatase at 30 °C for 30 min or with recombinant p38α and TAK1-TAB1 fusion protein in the presence of [32P]ATP. Phosphatase activity was analyzed as a shift in mobility on immunoblotting. The kinase activity was visualized by autoradiography.Immunoblotting—After the stimulation, whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously. Cell lysates were resolved by 7.5, 10, or 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P nylon membrane (Millipore). The membrane was treated with BlockAce (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Suita, Japan) and probed with primary antibodies. The antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat IgG (DAKO) and visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Some antibody reactions were carried out in the Can Get Signal solution (TOYOBO).FACS Analysis—After the stimulation, HeLa cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Where indicated, cells were permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% NaN3) containing 1 μg of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (LA1) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After washing with FACS buffer, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (DAKO) on ice for 30 min and analyzed by the FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences). The ratio of internalization of EGFR was calculated using the median values of fluorescence.Statistical Analysis—The significance of differences between groups was determined by applying Student's two-tailed t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSStress-induced Modifications of EGFR—HeLa cells have commonly been used for characterization of the TNF-α- and EGF-induced signaling pathways. We first confirmed activation of the downstream signaling pathways. Fig. 1A shows that both TNF-α and EGF rapidly activated MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) at similar time points within 10 min. In contrast, TAK1 and NF-κB p65 were only activated by TNF-α. The total expression level of these proteins was comparable (data not shown).We next investigated the effects of TNF-α on the phosphorylation of EGFR. Interestingly, TNF-α rapidly induced a shift in the mobility of EGFR on SDS-PAGE within 10 min (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the mobility of other EGFR family members (ErbB2–4) was not changed (data not shown) in HeLa cells. EGF also caused a mobility shift within 10 min (Fig. 1A). It should be noted that, although EGF induced strong phosphorylation at Tyr-845, -1045, -1068, and -1173 in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, only a faint tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in response to TNF-α (Fig. 1A). These results indicated that the TNF-α-induced mobility shift of EGFR is independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation.Once EGFR is activated by a specific ligand, it has been shown to rapidly enter a program of degradation through the phosphorylation of Tyr-1045 and subsequent c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination. In fact, the form shifted by EGF largely disappeared within 2 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the TNF-α-induced mobility shift was transient, and there was a return to the control level at 60 min (Fig. 1B). A similar mobility shift was observed in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Fig. 1B). High osmotic stress with additional 300 mm NaCl also caused a rapid shift in the mobility of EGFR without the tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1C); however, it was sustained for at least 2 h. Osmotic stress also induced prolonged activation of MAPKs but not TAK1 and NF-κB (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, no obvious degradation of EGFR was observed in cells treated with TNF-α and osmotic stress.Stress-induced Modification of EGFR Is Independent of ADAM-mediated Shedding of EGFR Ligand—G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated transactivation of EGFR has been shown to be mediated by the ADAM-dependent release of membrane-bound extracellular EGFR ligands. To explore the involvement of this mechanism in stress-induced modification of EGFR, we first examined the effects of PD153035, a potent EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Fig. 2A shows that PD153035 at 0.1 μm completely inhibited the EGF-induced mobility shift as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, whereas AG825, a selective ErbB2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had no inhibitory effect. In contrast, although a higher concentration (10 μm) of PD153035 blocked the TNF-α-induced mobility shift of EGFR, the TNF-α-induced modification was not influenced by PD153035 at the concentration having an effect on the EGFR tyrosine kinase (1 μm). These results indicate that the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR was not involved in the mobility shift (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Effects of anti-EGFR agents on stress-induced modification of EGFR. HeLa cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations (μm) of PD153035 (PD)(A and B), AG825 (AG)(A and B), or GM6001 (GM)(C and D) for 30 min and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF (A), 20 ng/ml TNF-α (B and C), or 300 mm NaCl (Osmo)(D) for 10 min. E, cells were pretreated with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) or an isotype-matched control IgG1 (1 μg/ml) for 2 h and then stimulated with TNF-α, osmotic stress, or EGF for 10 min. Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-EGFR, anti-EGFR (pY845), and anti-EGFR (pY1068) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GM6001, a broad spectrum inhibitor for metalloproteases, has widely been used as an ADAM inhibitor that blocks the transactivation of EGFR. However, GM6001 was not able to block the TNF-α and osmotic stress-induced mobility shift (Fig. 2, C and D). Furthermore, a neutralizing monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody did not inhibit the TNF-α- and osmotic stress-induced modifications of EGFR, although it effectively abrogated the EGF-induced activation of EGFR (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these results clearly demonstrated that the stress-induced modification of EGFR occurs independent of the ADAM-mediated shedding of the ligands.Effects on the Downstream Signaling Pathways—We and others have demonstrated that TNF-α-induced signaling pathways are partly dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR in several types of cells (27Ueno Y. Sakurai H. Matsuo M. Choo M.K. Koizumi K. Saiki I. Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 92: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Chen W.N. Woodbury R.L. Kathmann L.E. Opresko L.K. Zangar R.C.

Therefore, we next confirmed the effects of EGFR blockers on stress-induced signaling pathways in HeLa cells. Although PD153035 clearly blocked EGF-induced signaling pathways in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C), TNF-α-induced activation of p38, JNK, ERK, TAK1, and NF-κB was resistant at up to 10 μm (Fig. 3A). Similarly, osmotic stress-induced signaling pathways were not affected (Fig. 3B). In addition, neither GM6001 nor the EGFR neutralizing antibody blocked the TNF-α signaling pathways (Fig. 3, D and E). These results clearly demonstrated that the modification of EGFR in response to TNF-α and osmotic stress is not a process of EGFR transactivation.FIGURE 3Effects of anti-EGFR agents on the downstream signaling pathways. HeLa cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations (μm) of PD153035 (PD) for 30 min (D) and an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (E) as described in the legend to Fig. 2 and then stimulated with TNF-α (A), NaCl (high asmolarity, Osmo)(B), or EGF (C) for 5 min (for TAK1 and p65) or 10 min (for the other kinases).

The TNF-α-induced modification of EGFR was completely inhibited by pretreatment with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol and SB203580, inhibitors for TAK1 and p38, respectively (Fig. 4A). SB203580 (but not 5Z-7-oxozeaenol) also abrogated the osmotic stress-induced modification (Fig. 4A). In contrast, inhibitors for IKK, JNK, and MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) (SC-514, SP600125 and U0126, respectively) did not block modification of EGFR (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained in experiments using siRNA against TAK1 and p38α (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, these siRNAs were not effective in blocking the shift in the mobility of EGFR caused by EGF (Fig. 4, B and C).FIGURE 4Role of TAK1 and p38α in stress-induced phosphorylation of EGFR. A, HeLa cells were pretreated with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (0.3 μm), SC-514 (30 μm), SB203580 (20 μm), or SP600125 (20 μm) for 30 min and then stimulated with TNF-α or osmotic stress by 300 mm NaCl (high asmolarity, Osmo) for 10 min. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-EGFR antibody. Cells were transfected with siRNA (50 nm) against TAK1 (si-TAK1)(B), p38α (si-p38α)(C), and luciferase (si-luc)(B and C). At 72 h post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with TNF-α, osmotic stress, or EGF for 10 min. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against EGFR, phospho-p38, p38, and TAK1. D, EGFR was immunoprecipitated (IP) from untreated or TNF-α-stimulated HeLa cells and then incubated with λ-phosphatase (λ-PPase) in vitro. The shift in mobility was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-EGFR antibody. E, EGFR was immunoprecipitated from untreated HeLa cells and then incubated with recombinant p38α and TAK1-TAB1 fusion protein in the presence of [32P]ATP. Incorporation of [32P]phosphate was visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. Cont, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TNF-α-induced Phosphorylation of EGFR—To identify the kinds of modifications that occurred on EGFR, we first investigated the possibility of phosphorylation. EGFR was immunoprecipitated from cells untreated or treated with TNF-α for 10 min, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with λ-phosphatase in vitro. Fig. 4D shows that the reduced mobility was completely restored, indicating that phosphorylation at unknown Ser/Thr residues is involved, at least in part, in the TNF-α-induced modification of EGFR.As shown above, p38α and TAK1 are possible candidates for Ser/Thr kinases. We therefore performed in vitro kinase assays using recombinant kinases. Whole cell lysates prepared from unstimulated HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated with normal IgG or anti-EGFR antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then incubated with recombinant p38α or TAK1-TAB1 fusion protein (an active TAK1 protein) in the presence of 32P-labeled ATP. In the absence of recombinant kinases, EGFR had an autophosphorylation activity. Both p38α and TAK1 induced the incorporation of radioactivity into the EGFR (Fig. 4E); however, the activity was not as strong as that against the known substrates ATF2 and MKK6, respectively (data not shown).Stress-induced Phosphorylation Suppressed Ligand-mediated Activation of EGFR—We investigated the role of the transient modification of EGFR in ligand-mediated activation. HeLa cells were pretreated with TNF-α for 10 or 60 min and then stimulated with EGF for another 2 or 10 min in the presence of TNF-α. The 10-min pretreatment induced a complete shift in the mobility of EGFR (Fig. 5A). The stimulation with EGF did not induce any additional mobility shift. Surprisingly, the EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR was impaired by the pretreatment with TNF-α for 10 min (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, with the disappearance of the mobility shift at 60 min after pre-TNF-α stimulation, the ability of EGFR to respond to its ligand was largely restored (Fig. 5A). The reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR is correlated with the suppression of EGF-induced activation of the downstream ribosomal p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) (Fig. 5B). These results clearly demonstrated that the TNF-α-induced modification of EGFR suppressed the ability of the receptor to respond to its extracellular ligands.FIGURE 5Transient suppression of EGFR by TNF-α. A, HeLa cells were pretreated with TNF-α for 10 or 60 min and then stimulated with EGF for another 2 or 10 min. Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-EGFR, anti-EGFR (pY845), and anti-EGFR (pY1068) antibodies.

Here, we report that ING4 undergoes alternative splicing. Expression analysis identified novel ING4 spliced variant mRNAs encoding proteins devoid of different portions. The ING4 variants were detected in both normal and tumor tissues. The existence of ING4 variants was confirmed by several approaches, including reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, real-time PCR and in silico experiments. To investigate the functional consequences of alternative splicing the ING4 variant cDNAs were expressed in mammalian cells. Our studies indicated that (i) the ING4 variants do not differ from wild-type in their nuclear localization, interaction with p53 and association to HBO1 complex; and (ii) the ING4-ΔEx6A variant, devoid of the C-terminal portion, loses the capability to inhibit NF-κB. On the whole our data suggest that alternative splicing could modulate the activity of ING4 tumor suppressor protein."
https://openalex.org/W2148333449,"The aim of this study was to quantify the buffer attributes (value, power, range and optimum) of two model systems for whole human resting saliva, the purified proteins from whole human resting saliva and single proteins. Two model systems, the first containing amyloglucosidase and lysozyme, and the second containing amyloglucosidase and α-amylase, were shown to provide, in combination with hydrogencarbonate and di-hydrogenphosphate, almost identical buffer attributes as whole human resting saliva. It was further demonstrated that changes in the protein concentration as small as 0.1% may change the buffer value of a buffer solution up to 15 times. Additionally, it was shown that there was a protein concentration change in the same range (0.16%) between saliva samples collected at the time periods of 13:00 and others collected at 9:00 am and 17:00. The mode of the protein expression changed between these samples corresponded to the change in basic buffer power and the change of the buffer value at pH 6.7. Finally, SDS Page and Ruthenium II tris (bathophenantroline disulfonate) staining unveiled a constant protein expression in all samples except for one 50 kDa protein band. As the change in the expression pattern of that 50 kDa protein band corresponded to the change in basic buffer power and the buffer value at pH 6.7, it was reasonable to conclude that this 50 kDa protein band may contain the protein(s) belonging to the protein buffer system of human saliva."
https://openalex.org/W1997553001,"M-phase Promoting Factor (MPF; the cyclin B-cdk 1 complex) is activated at M-phase onset by removal of inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk1 at thr-14 and tyr-15. At M-phase exit, MPF is destroyed by ubiquitin-dependent cyclin proteolysis. Thus, control of MPF activity via inhibitory phosphorylation is believed to be particularly crucial in regulating transition into, rather than out of, M-phase. Using the in vitro cell cycle system derived form Xenopus eggs, here we show, however, that inhibitory phosphorylation of cdk1 contributes to control MPF activity during M-phase exit. By sampling extracts at very short intervals during both meiotic and mitotic exit, we found that cyclin B1-associated cdk1 underwent transient inhibitory phosphorylation at tyr-15 and that cyclin B1-cdk1 activity fell more rapidly than the cyclin B1 content. Inhibitory phosphorylation of MPF correlated with phosphorylation changes of cdc25C, the MPF phosphatase, and physical interaction of cdk1 with wee1, the MPF kinase, during M-phase exit. MPF down-regulation required Ca++/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activities at meiosis and mitosis exit, respectively. Treatment of M-phase extracts with a mutant cyclin B1-cdk1AF complex, refractory to inhibition by phosphorylation, impaired binding of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) to its co-activator Cdc20 and altered M-phase exit. Thus, timely M-phase exit requires a tight coupling of proteolysis-dependent and proteolysis-independent mechanisms of MPF inactivation."

Here we show that a PUF-family RNA-binding protein, Mpt5, represses the yeast MAP-kinase pathway controlling differentiation to the filamentous form. Mpt5 represses the protein levels of two pathway components, the Ste7 MAP-kinase kinase and the Tec1 transcriptional activator, and negatively regulates the kinase activity of the Kss1 MAP kinase. Moreover, Mpt5 specifically inhibits the output of the pathway in the absence of stimuli, and thereby prevents inappropriate cell differentiation. The results provide an example of what may be a genome-scale level of regulation at the interface of signaling networks and protein-RNA binding networks."

We previously showed primary keratocytes cultured under serum-free conditions to secrete matrix similar to that of normal stroma, but serum and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) induced secretion of fibrotic matrix components, including HA. This study found HA secretion by primary bovine keratocytes to increase rapidly in response to TGFβ, reaching a maximum in 12 h and then decreasing to <5% of the maximum by 48 h. Cell-free biosynthesis of HA by cell extracts also exhibited a transient peak at 12 h after TGFβ treatment. mRNA for hyaluronan synthase enzymes HAS1 and HAS2 increased >10- and >50-fold, respectively, in 4–6 h, decreasing to near original levels after 24–48 h. Small interfering RNA against HAS2 inhibited the transient increase of HAS2 mRNA and completely blocked HA induction, but small interfering RNA to HAS1 had no effect on HA secretion. HAS2 mRNA was induced by a variety of mitogens, and TGFβ acted synergistically to induce HAS2 by as much as 150-fold. In addition to HA synthesis, treatment with TGFβ induced degradation of fluorescein-HA added to culture medium.

Tien J.Y. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2004; 72: 89-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The corneal stroma, unlike most vertebrate tissues, is virtually devoid of HA. During active corneal wound healing and in corneas with various chronic pathologies, however, hyaluronan becomes abundant in the corneal stroma (2Fitzsimmons T.D. Molander N. Stenevi U. Fagerholm P. Schenholm M. von Malmborg A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2774-2782PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hassell J.R. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The corneal stroma maintains transparency to light by virtue of the highly organized structure of its collagenous extracellular matrix. Collagen fibrils of the stroma exhibit highly regular parallel alignment and spacing. This spacing is controlled by collagen-associated small leucine-rich proteoglycans that form glycosaminoglycan cross-links between adjacent fibrils (4Hirsch M. Prenant G. Renard G. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 72: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Disruption of the fibril spacing is a major cause of loss of corneal transparency in scarring and stromal pathological conditions (5Meek K.M. Leonard D.W. Connon C.J. Dennis S. Khan S. Eye (Lond.). 2003; 17: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In scars, interfibrillar glycosaminoglycan cross-links are altered or eliminated, and spaces without fibrils, known as “lakes,” have been identified (5Meek K.M. Leonard D.W. Connon C.J. Dennis S. Khan S. Eye (Lond.). 2003; 17: 927-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The almost ubiquitous presence of HA in nontransparent corneas suggests a relationship between the large hydrodynamic volume occupied by HA molecules and the disruption of the stromal ultrastructure. Additionally, the recent recognition of the diverse bioactivity of HA (6Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar) raises the potential that matrix production by stromal keratocytes may be altered as a response to the HA present in pathological tissues. We have therefore undertaken a study to define the molecular mechanism by which HA is produced in the corneal stroma. The stroma is populated by keratocytes, mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin. In vitro, keratocytes under quiescent serum-free conditions secrete matrix components similar or identical to those they produce in vivo (7Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell J.R.

We found a rapid increase in HA biosynthesis resulting from increases in mRNA pools of the HAS2 gene. This mRNA undergoes a rapid and transient response, peaking at 4–6 h after stimulation and returning to near base line within 24 h. HA biosynthesis also increases rapidly, peaking at 12 h and decreasing thereafter. Cell Culture—Corneal stromas from fresh bovine eyes (Pel-Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AR) were digested with collagenase as described previously (9Long C.J. Roth M.R. Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh M.

The cells were diluted in serum-free DME/F12 medium containing antibiotics and cultured on tissue culture-treated plastic at 4 × 104 cells/cm2 in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Myofibroblastic transformation was induced by the addition of the same medium containing 2% FBS and 1 ng/ml recombinant human TGFβ1 (Sigma). Heparin-stripped horse serum was prepared as described previously (20Funderburgh M.L. Du Y. Mann M.M. Sundarraj N. Funderburgh J.L.

Quantification of Glycosaminoglycans Using FACE—Glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans were isolated from the culture medium of three identical 75-cm2 flasks using ion exchange chromatography as described previously (10Funderburgh J.L.

Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and hyaluronan were digested with chondroitinase ABC (catalog number C3667, Sigma), 0.2 units/ml for 16 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m NH4 acetate, pH 7.5. Digested products were recovered by ultrafiltration through Microcon YM-3 microfiltration devices (Millipore). Mannose was added to aliquots of the digestion products as an internal standard, and the carbohydrates were fluorescently labeled with 5 μlof 0.1 m 2-aminoacridone in 3:17 (v/v) acetic acid/dimethyl sulfoxide for 15 min followed by addition of 5 μl of freshly dissolved 1 m sodium cyanoborohydride at 37 °C overnight (21Plaas A.H. West L. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 117-128PubMed Google Scholar). Borohydride was quenched with 30 μl of 25% glycerol containing 2 μl of 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and the derivatized disaccharides were separated on 8 × 10 × 0.05-cm gels of 27% acrylamide, 0.72% bisacrylamide containing 0.045 m Tris acetate, pH 7, and 0.25% glycerol. The running buffer was 0.089 m Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3, chilled to 4 °C. Electrophoresis was carried out on ice at 8 watts of constant power per gel. Fluorescent bands were immediately photographed using a 12-bit Bio-Rad FluorS Max imaging system, and quantification was accomplished with Bio-Rad Quantity One software. FACE bands generated by chondroitinase were identified by co-electrophoresis with purified standards of fragments from chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan (Sigma). HA was also quantified directly in conditioned culture medium using a competitive ELISA based on HA binding to biotinylated HABP (Echelon Biosystems Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). 100 μl of each culture medium was assayed in triplicate using a standard curve of HA according to the manufacturer's directions. HA Biosynthesis by Keratocytes—Primary bovine keratocytes were seeded at 1 × 106/well on FNC (Athena Environmental Service, Inc.) pre-coated 6-well plates in serum-free DME/F12 medium. Fibroblastic response was induced with 2% FBS and 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 in DME/F12 for 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h, respectively. The control was incubated in serum-free DME/F12. During the last 6 h of incubation, [3H]glucosamine (38.3 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 50 μCi/ml. After labeling, the medium was collected; the cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS. The wash and medium were combined, and glycosaminoglycans in the culture medium were purified by ion exchange chromatography, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. The dried samples were dissolved in 60 μl of 0.02 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl. HA was captured on wells of a microtiter plate coated with hyaluronan-binding protein (HABP) (Corgenix Inc.). To confirm the captured radioactivity as radiolabeled HA, one-half of each sample was digested by 1 TRU/μl Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 50 °C overnight before adsorption by HABP. Triplicate 100-μl samples were added into a 96-well HABP-coated plate and incubated at room temperature overnight followed by four washes with PBS. The bound HA was released by digestion with 25 μg/ml proteinase K in 0.1% SDS and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 2 h. The solution was transferred to scintillation vials, and the incorporation of [3H]GlcNAc into HA was determined as disintegrations/min (dpm) using a Beckman Coulter LS 3801 after the addition and complete emulsion of the samples in 4 ml of Scintisafe (Fisher) scintillant. Membrane Preparation—Primary bovine keratocytes in DME/F12 were first seeded at 3–6 × 106 cells/150 cm2 on collagen-coated culture dishes in serum-free DME/F12 for 48 h and then were induced with 2% FBS and 1 ng/ml TGFβ1in DME/F12 for variable times. After induction, the cells were washed, harvested in cold PBS, and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in cold hypotonic homogenization buffer, containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10mm KCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (catalog number P8340, Sigma). After swelling on ice for 10 min, the cells were disrupted by sonication, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants containing crude membranes were centrifuged in a Beckman TLA100.2 rotor at 80,000 × g for 50 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended using homogenization buffer and centrifuged again at 80,000 × g for 30 min. The washed membrane pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 15% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2,1mm EGTA and stored at –80 °C until use. The membrane protein concentration was measured by fluorescence using Nano-Orange reagent (Invitrogen). In Vitro HA Synthase Activity—To measure HA polymerization, 0.1 mm unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc, 2.2 μm3H-labeled UDP-GlcNAc (60 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.), 0.5 mm UDP-GlcUA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol were added to 10 μg of the membrane protein in a total of 50 μl. One-half of each sample was incubated for 4 h at 37°C, and the reactions were then terminated by boiling the mixture for 10 min. The second part was boiled for 10 min first and then subjected to incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. HA production was captured by using an HABP plate as described above. Captured HA was released by proteinase K. The solution was transferred to scintillation vials, and the incorporation of [3H]UDP-GlcNAc into HA was determined as disintegrations/min using a Beckman Coulter LS 3801. Degradation of Fluorescein-labeled HA—Fluorescein-HA (Sigma) was isolated by initial chromatography on a Superose 6 gel size exclusion column, eluted in 0.02 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl. High molecular weight fractions were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, dried, and dissolved in DME/F12, filtersterilized, and stored at –20 °C until use. Primary bovine keratocytes in DME/F12 were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well on FNC pre-coated 6-well plates and induced with 2% FBS and 1 ng/ml TGFβ1 in DME/F12 for 3 days. Control cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well in serum-free DME/F12. Three days later, 7.5 μg/ml fluorescein HA was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The medium was collected, and glycosaminoglycans in the culture medium were purified by ion exchange chromatography and subjected to size exclusion chromatography on Superose 6 gel using the conditions described above. The fluorescence of the fractions was measured by FLx800 Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). mRNA Quantification—Cells were collected by centrifugation after scraping into cold saline, and RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was treated with DNase I (Ambion) according to the supplier's protocol. RNA (400 ng) was transcribed to cDNA in a 100-μl reaction containing 1× PCR II buffer (Roche Applied Science), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 800 μm dNTP mixture (Roche Applied Science), 2.5 μm random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.4 units of RNase inhibitor, and 125 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was carried out for 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 60 s at 60 °C after an initial incubation at 95 °C for 10 min in an ABI 7700 thermocycler. Reaction volume was 25 μl containing 1× TaqMan reaction buffer (Applied Biosystems), primers, probe, and cDNA. Forward and reverse primers and fluorescent internal hybridization probes for each gene, as shown in Table 1, were used at optimized concentrations. Efficiency of the amplification was determined to be >90% in each case.TABLE 1Primers and siRNAGenePrimerSequenceHAS1ForwardAGGCCTGGTACAACCAGAAGReverseTCTCCGAGTAGCAGCGAGACTaqman probeFAM-AGCATGGGCTATGCCACCAAGTACAC-TAMRAsiRNA 1GUGCUGCTCTCACUCUAUAsiRNA 2GGAACAACCUCCUGCAGCAsiRNA 3GCGAGUGGCUGUACAAUGCsiRNA 4ACGCGUGGAUGACCUACGAHAS2ForwardCCGTCATCACTGGGTTCTTCReverseTAAGGCAGCTGGCAAAAGATTaqman probeFAM-TCATTGCCACGGTAATCCAGCTCTTC-TAMRAsiRNACCUUGGAAUCACAGCUGCUUAUAUUHAS3ForwardCCAACCGAGTCCTGAGTCTTReverseTGTATGACCGTGGCAATGAGTaqman probeFAM-CTCCCGGAAGTAAGACTTGCTCCAGC-TAMRA Open table in a new tab For each gene/cDNA combination, amplifications without reverse transcriptase were carried out as negative controls. Amplification of 18 S ribosomal RNA was carried out for each cDNA (in triplicate) for normalization of RNA content. Threshold cycle number (Ct) of amplification in each sample was determined by ABI software. Relative mRNA abundance was calculated as the Ct for amplification of a gene-specific cDNA minus average Ct for 18 S, expressed as a power of 2, i.e. 2–ΔCt. Three individual gene-specific values, thus calculated, were averaged to obtain standard errors. Gene Knockdown Using siRNA—Uncultured primary cells at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in siPORT electroporation buffer (Ambion Inc.) were transfected with 21-bp double-stranded siRNA. For HAS1 mRNA a mixture of four siRNAs was used (Smart Pool, Dharmacon), and for HAS2 a single 21-bp chemically modified siRNA (Stealth RNA, Invitrogen) was transfected at 1 μm final concentration using electroporation with an ECM830 Square Wave electroporator (BTX Inc., San Diego) with three pulses of 3500 V/cm, each pulse having a duration of 300 μs with a delay of 125 ms between pulses. The cells were plated at 8 × 104 cells/cm2 in serum-free medium on tissue culture plastic, precoated with FNC coating mixture. After 24 h, cells were treated with 2% FBS and 1 ng/ml TGFβ for 6 h, and RNA was prepared for qRT-PCR analysis. For analysis of HA secretion, conditioned medium was collected from 24 to 72 h after electroporation as a negative control. At 72 h the medium was changed to 2% FBS, 1 ng/ml TGFβ. After 48 h this medium was collected for analysis of HA by FACE gels. We previously reported HA secretion by quiescent primary cultures of bovine keratocytes to increase from undetectable levels to 5% of the total glycosaminoglycan 6 days after induction of myofibroblastic transdifferentiation with FBS and TGFβ. In this study we initially examined the kinetics of induction of the HA using FACE gel technology. As shown in Fig. 1A, the HA disaccharide (diHA) band could be detected within 6 h of exposure to FBS + TGFβ1, and its abundance increased after 12 h in the induction medium. Disaccharides containing 6-sulfate from chondroitin-dermatan sulfate (diCS-6S) also increased rapidly; however, total chondroitin/dermatan sulfate did not change for at least 24 h of treatment. Quantification of the HA from FACE analysis similar to that shown in Fig. 1A is presented in Fig. 1B. The HA recovered from culture medium increased at both 6 and 12 h of FBS + TGFβ treatment, after which the HA level remained statistically unchanged for at least 72 h. This plateau in HA accumulation suggests a decrease in the biosynthetic rate and/or increased degradation occurring after 12hofTGFβ exposure. Alterations in HA biosynthesis and degradation are explored in the experiments shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2A, secreted HA was recovered from culture medium after 6 h of metabolic labeling with [3H]glucosamine. Incorporation during the 6-h labeling period was minimal without TGFβ treatment, but after exposure to TGFβ, 3H-labeled HA increased markedly at 6 h, reaching a peak at 12 h of incorporation, exhibiting a 75-fold increase compared with the untreated cultures. After 12 h, incorporation decreased rapidly. By 24 h metabolic labeling of the HA was about 3-fold that of untreated controls. By 48 h the rate had decreased to only 5% of the maximum rate but still remained about 2-fold that of the control. Incorporation of label under the conditions in Fig. 2A represents a balance between biosynthesis and degradation. To explore the extent to which HA degradation contributed to the results of Fig. 2A, degradation of fluorescent HA added to culture medium was examined using size exclusion chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2B, HA exposed to quiescent keratocytes for 24 h was recovered quantitatively and showed no change in molecular size or release of small fragments. In cultures treated with FBS + TGFβ1, all of the added HA was recovered, but ∼25% was degraded to smaller fragments. These results suggest that HA secreted during a 6-hour labeling period (as in Fig. 2A) would be expected to be recovered quantitatively and largely intact (94–100%). The changes in accumulation in HA observed in Fig. 2A, therefore, may be viewed as largely the result of alteration in HA biosynthesis with relatively minor contribution by catabolic action. In Fig. 2C, membrane preparations from cells treated with FBS + TGFβ were used in a cell-free assay of HA biosynthesis. Cells treated for 12 h showed >40-fold stimulation over controls. At 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment the synthetic activity was maintained at ∼3-fold of the control (p < 0.05). These results are consistent with those of Fig. 2A in support of the conclusion that TGFβ produces a transient induction of HA biosynthesis reaching a maximum within 12 h and decreasing thereafter to a level 2–3 times that of untreated cells. Three HAS genes have been described, and their expression varies with different tissues. To determine which might be expressed in keratocytes, cDNA from keratocyte cultures untreated and treated for 6 h with FBS + TGFβ1 was amplified using primers specific for each of three bovine HAS genes. As seen in Fig. 3, each of the primer sets amplified a single product of the expected length. Keratocytes therefore appear to express mRNA for all three of the HAS mammalian genes. In the TGFβ-treated cells, the bands for HAS1 and HAS2 were considerably stronger, suggesting an increase in mRNA pool size for these genes in response to TGFβ. Quantitative RT-PCR assays were designed with the primers used in Fig. 3 to determine the changes of the HAS mRNA pools in response to FBS + TGFβ1. As shown in Fig. 4, HAS1 and HAS2 each exhibited a rapid increase after stimulation of the cells, reaching a maximum in 4–6 h. HAS3, however, showed no change in pool size over 72 h of treatment. HAS2 increased 30–50-fold under these conditions, whereas HAS1 increased about 10-fold. The pools of mRNA for both genes decreased rapidly after reaching maximum. HAS1, in fact, decreased to almost the same level as untreated cells within 24 h, whereas HAS2 was about 2-fold the original level after 48 h. The very rapid increase in both mRNA pools and HA biosynthesis suggests a causal relationship. To test this relationship siRNA probes were designed for HAS1 and HAS2. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment of the keratocytes with HAS1 siRNA for 24 h before growth factor treatment completely blocked increases in HAS1 mRNA pools but had no effect on the increased pool of HAS2 transcripts. Conversely, siRNA with HAS2-specific sequence was able to block about 95% of the up-regulation of HAS2 mRNA but had no effect on the pool size of HAS1. Electroporation of a mixture of the two siRNAs completely blocked both HAS1 and HAS2 up-regulation. Secretion of HA by the keratocytes in the presence of the siRNA showed HA biosynthesis to be correlated only with HAS2 mRNA levels. In the experiment shown in Fig. 6A, HA was measured using an ELISA based on binding of HABP. HA in medium was determined both before and after induction of HA biosynthesis by FBS + TGFβ1. In each case the pre-induction levels of secreted HA were near the lower limits of detection (Fig. 6A, open bars on left). After induction (Fig. 6A, gray bars), HAS1 siRNA transfection resulted in no statistically significant alteration in the HA amount compared with a mock transfection control. HAS2 siRNA, however, blocked the stimulation of HA secretion by about 93% (p < 0.01). A combination of siRNA to HAS1 and HAS2 in the same cultures reduced the HA secretion by 92% (p < 0.03). In a similar experiment shown in Fig. 6B, HA and chondroitin sulfate secretion were measured by FACE. The diCS-0S band of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (Fig. 6B, gray bars), measured on the same gel as the HA, showed no change as a result of HAS siRNA transfection, whereas HAS2 siRNA reduced the DiHA bands by >90%. These results show the specificity of the HAS2 siRNA in blocking only HA secretion and support the hypothesis that the up-regulation of HA biosynthesis by keratocytes in response to FBS + TGFβ1 stems directly from the rapid increase in HAS2 mRNA pool. HAS1 mRNA appears to play no role in this response. We previously found synthesis of HA to be up-regulated after 6 days of exposure to FBS + TGFβ1; however, the data in this study show a marked decrease in HAS mRNA and HA synthesis after 24 h. To understand the temporal expression patterns, HAS2 mRNA was examined for longer times. As seen in Fig. 7A, HAS2 mRNA pools after the initial transient peak remained slightly elevated (about 2-fold) compared with levels of the untreated controls for at least 7 days. To test if HAS2 was involved in continued HA biosynthesis, we transfected HAS2 siRNA into keratocytes 24 h after growth factor treatment, a time at which mRNA pools had stabilized at a lower level. As shown in Fig. 7B, HA secretion over the 48–96-h period was suppressed by about 65% by this treatment, suggesting continued secretion of HA to be th"

Such vaccines culminate in tumor-specific T cell responses, implicating the role of adaptive immunity. We have developed a rapid and efficient procedure utilizing an isoelectric focusing technique to obtain vaccines from tumor or normal tissues called chaperone-rich cell lysate (CRCL). Tumor-associated peptides, the currency of T cell-mediated anticancer immunity, are believed to be purveyed by chaperone vaccines. Our purpose was to demonstrate our ability to manipulate the peptide antigen repertoire of CRCL vaccines as a novel anticancer strategy. Our methods allow us to prepare ""designer"" CRCL, utilizing the immunostimulation activity and the carrying capacity of CRCL to quantitatively acquire and deliver exogenous antigenic peptides (e.g., derived from the oncogenic BCR/ABL protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia). Using fluorescence-based and antigen-presentation assays, we determined that significant quantities of exogenously added peptide could accumulate in ""designer"" CRCL and could stimulate T cell activation. Further, we concluded that peptide-embedded CRCL, devoid of other antigens, could generate potent immunity against pre-established murine leukemia. Designer CRCL allows for the development of personalized vaccines against cancers expressing known antigens, by embedding antigens into CRCL derived from normal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2031437536,"Government-imposed feed bans have created a need for new applications for meat & bone meal (MBM). Many potential new applications require MBM protein to be both soluble and free of infectious prion. Treatment with protease is generally effective in reducing insoluble, thermally-denatured proteins to soluble peptides. It has been reported in the literature that certain proteases, including Versazyme, are able to degrade infectious prions in a system where the prions are readily accessible to proteolytic attack. Prions distributed within MBM, however, may conceivably be protected from proteases.The overall rate of proteolytic MBM digestion depends greatly on whether the protease can penetrate deep within individual particles, or if the protease can only act near the surface of the particle. This research examined the barriers to the diffusion of Versazyme into particles of MBM. Confocal microscopy demonstrated differences in the density distributions between the bone and the soft tissue particles of MBM. By tracking the diffusion of fluorescently labeled Versazyme through individual particles, it was found that bone particles show full Versazyme penetration within 30 minutes, while penetration of soft tissue particles can take up to four hours, depending on the particle's diameter. From the variety of normal proteins comprising MBM, a specific protein was chosen to serve as a prion surrogate based on characteristics including size, solubility, distribution and abundance. This surrogate was used to measure the effect of several factors on Versazyme diffusion.Results showed that surrogate distributed in bone particles was more susceptible to degradation than that in soft tissue particles. Three factors controllable by unit operations in an industrial-scale process were also tested. It was found that removing the lipid content and hydrating MBM prior to incubation both significantly increased the rate of surrogate degradation. In a test of particle size, the smallest collected diameter range demonstrated the largest degradation of the prion surrogate, suggesting milling would be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2060847273,"Background When steady fixation is maintained on the centre of a large patch of texture, holes in the periphery of the texture rapidly fade from awareness, producing artificial scotomata (i.e., invisible areas of reduced vision, like the natural ‘blind spot’). There has been considerable controversy about whether this apparent ‘filling in’ depends on a low-level or high-level visual process. Evidence for an active process is that when the texture around the scotomata is suddenly removed, phantasms of the texture appear within the previous scotomata. Methodology To see if these phantasms were equivalent to real low-level signals, we measured contrast discrimination for real dynamic texture patches presented on top of the phantasms. Principal Findings Phantasm intensity varied with adapting contrast. Contrast discrimination depended on both (real) pedestal contrast and phantasm intensity, in a manner indicative of a common sensory threshold. The phantasms showed inter-ocular transfer, proving that their effects are cortical rather than retinal. Conclusions We show that this effect is consistent with a tonic spreading of the adapting texture into the scotomata, coupled with some overall loss of sensitivity. Our results support the view that ‘filling in’ happens at an early stage of visual processing, quite possibly in primary visual cortex (V1)."
https://openalex.org/W1981613206,"When observers view a grid of mid-gray lines superimposed on a black background, they report seeing illusory dark gray smudges at the grid intersections, an effect known as the Hermann grid illusion. The strength of the illusion is often measured using the cancellation technique: A white disk is placed over one of these intersections and the luminance of the disk is reduced until the disk disappears. Its luminance at this point, i.e., the disk's detection threshold, is taken to be a measure of the strength of the illusion. Our experiments showed that some distortions of the Hermann grid, which were sufficient to completely disrupt the illusion, did not reduce the disk's detection threshold. This showed that the cancellation technique is not a valid method for measuring the strength of the Hermann grid illusion. Those studies that attempted to use this technique inadvertently studied a different effect known as the blanking phenomenon. We conclude by presenting an explanation for the latter effect."
