https://openalex.org/W2970092081,"Direct investigation of the early cellular changes induced by metastatic cells within the surrounding tissue remains a challenge. Here we present a system in which metastatic cancer cells release a cell-penetrating fluorescent protein, which is taken up by neighbouring cells and enables spatial identification of the local metastatic cellular environment. Using this system, tissue cells with low representation in the metastatic niche can be identified and characterized within the bulk tissue. To highlight its potential, we applied this strategy to study the cellular environment of metastatic breast cancer cells in the lung. We report the presence of cancer-associated parenchymal cells, which exhibit stem-cell-like features, expression of lung progenitor markers, multi-lineage differentiation potential and self-renewal activity. In ex vivo assays, lung epithelial cells acquire a cancer-associated parenchymal-cell-like phenotype when co-cultured with cancer cells and support their growth. These results highlight the potential of this method as a platform for new discoveries. A cell-penetrating fluorescent marker is used to label cells in the metastatic tumour microenvironment, revealing a variety of cell types including parenchymal cells with lung stem-cell characteristics."

For decades, the potential role of gut microbiota in sepsis pathogenesis has been revealed. However, the systemic and functional link between gut microbiota and sepsis has remained unexplored. To address this gap in knowledge, we carried out systematic analyses on clinical stool samples from patients with sepsis, including 16S rDNA sequencing, metabolomics, and metaproteomics analyses. In addition, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation from human to mice to validate the roles of gut microbiota on sepsis progression. We found that the composition of gut microbiota was significantly disrupted in patients with sepsis compared with healthy individuals. Besides, the microbial functions were significantly altered in septic feces as identified by metabolomics and metaproteomics analyses. Interestingly, mice that received septic feces exhibited more severe hepatic inflammation and injury than mice that received healthy feces after cecal ligation and puncture. Finally, several strains of intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites were corelated with serum total bilirubin levels in patients with sepsis. Taken together, our data indicated that sepsis development is associated with the disruption of gut microbiota at both compositional and functional levels, and such enteric dysbiosis could promote organ inflammation and injury during sepsis.-Liu, Z., Li, N., Fang, H., Chen, X., Guo, Y., Gong, S., Niu, M., Zhou, H., Jiang, Y., Chang, P., Chen, P. Enteric dysbiosis is associated with sepsis in patients."

Phytoremediation is a natural method of utilizing plants to remove contaminants from the soil. The goal of this study was to investigate the ability of Cannabis sativa L. to sustainably grow and remediate abandoned coal mine land soils in Pennsylvania. In this study, six different varieties of industrial hemp (Fedora 17, Felina 32, Ferimon, Futura 75, Santhica 27, and USO 31) were grown on two different contaminated soil types and two commercial soils (Miracle-Gro Potting Mix and PRO-MIX HP Mycorrhizae High Porosity Grower Mix). Plants growing in all soil types were exposed to two environmental conditions (outside and in the greenhouse). Seed germination response and plant height indicated no significant differences among all hemp varieties grown in different soils, however on an average, the height of the plants grown in the greenhouse exceeded that of the plants grown outdoors. In addition, heavy metal analysis of Arsenic, Lead, Nickel, Mercury, and Cadmium was performed. The concentration of Nickel was 2.54 times greater in the leaves of hemp grown in mine land soil outdoors when compared to greenhouse conditions. No differences were found between expression of heavy metal transporter genes. Secondary metabolite analysis of floral buds from hemp grown in mine land soil displayed a significant increase in the total Cannabidiol content (2.16%, 2.58%) when compared to Miracle-Gro control soil (1.08%, 1.6%) for outdoors and in the greenhouse, respectively. Molecular analysis using qRT-PCR indicated an 18-fold increase in the expression of the cannabidiolic acid synthase gene in plants grown on mine land soil. The data indicates a high tolerance to heavy metals as indicated from the physiological and metabolites analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2970114831,"Aeromonas veronii is a gram-negative species abundant in aquatic environments that causes disease in humans as well as terrestrial and aquatic animals. In the current study, 41 publicly available A. veronii genomes were compared to investigate distribution of putative virulence genes, global dissemination of pathotypes, and potential mechanisms of virulence. The complete genome of A. veronii strain ML09-123 from an outbreak of motile aeromonas septicemia in farm-raised catfish in the southeastern United States was included. Dissemination of A. veronii strain types was discovered in dispersed geographical locations. Isolate ML09-123 is highly similar to Chinese isolate TH0426, suggesting the two strains have a common origin and may represent a pathotype impacting aquaculture in both countries. Virulence of strain ML09-123 in catfish in a dose-dependent manner was confirmed experimentally. Subsystem category disposition showed the majority of genomes exhibit similar distribution of genomic elements. The type I secretion system (T1SS), type II secretion system (T2SS), type 4 pilus (T4P), and flagellum core elements are conserved in all A. veronii genomes, whereas the type III secretion system (T3SS), type V secretion system (T5SS), type VI secretion system (T6SS), and tight adherence (TAD) system demonstrate variable dispersal. Distribution of mobile elements is dependent on host and geographic origin, suggesting this species has undergone considerable genetic exchange. The data presented here lends insight into the genomic variation of A. veronii and identifies a pathotype impacting aquaculture globally."
https://openalex.org/W2971112571,"Objective To describe users’ and therapists’ opinions on multi-function myoelectric upper limb prostheses with conventional control and pattern recognition control. Design Qualitative interview study. Settings Two rehabilitation institutions in the Netherlands and one in Austria. Subjects The study cohort consisted of 15 prosthesis users (13 males, mean age: 43.7 years, average experience with multi-function prosthesis: 3.15 years) and seven therapists (one male, mean age: 44.1 years, average experience with multi-function prostheses: 6.6 years). Four of these users and one therapist had experience with pattern recognition control. Method This study consisted of semi-structured interviews. The participants were interviewed at their rehabilitation centres or at home by telephone. The thematic framework approach was used for analysis. Results The themes emerging from prosthesis users and therapists were largely congruent and resulted in one thematic framework with three main themes: control, prosthesis, and activities. The participants mostly addressed (dis-) satisfaction with the control type and the prosthesis itself and described the way they used their prostheses in daily tasks. Conclusion Prosthesis users and therapists described multi-function upper limb prostheses as more functional devices than conventional one-degree-of-freedom prostheses. Nonetheless, the prostheses were seldom used to actively grasp and manipulate objects. Moreover, the participants clearly expressed their dissatisfaction with the mechanical robustness of the devices and with the process of switching prosthesis function under conventional control. Pattern recognition was appreciated as an intuitive control that facilitated fast switching between prosthesis functions, but was reported to be too unreliable for daily use and require extensive training."
https://openalex.org/W2970653952,"Ti-6Al-4V is commonly used in orthopaedic implants, and fabrication techniques such as Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) are becoming increasingly popular for the net-shape production of such implants, as PBF allows for complex customisation and minimal material wastage. Present research into PBF fabricated Ti-6Al-4V focuses on new design strategies (e.g. designing pores, struts or lattices) or mechanical property optimisation through process parameter control-however, it is pertinent to examine the effects of altering PBF process parameters on properties relating to bioactivity. Herein, changes in Ti-6Al-4V microstructure, mechanical properties and surface characteristics were examined as a result of varying PBF process parameters, with a view to understanding how to tune Ti-6Al-4V bio-activity during the fabrication stage itself. The interplay between various PBF laser scan speeds and laser powers influenced Ti-6Al-4V hardness, porosity, roughness and corrosion resistance, in a manner not clearly described by the commonly used volumetric energy density (VED) design variable. Key findings indicate that the relationships between PBF process parameters and ultimate Ti-6Al-4V properties are not straightforward as expected, and that wide ranges of porosity (0.03 ± 0.01% to 32.59 ± 2.72%) and corrosion resistance can be achieved through relatively minor changes in process parameters used-indicating volumetric energy density is a poor predictor of PBF Ti-6Al-4V properties. While variations in electrochemical behaviour with respect to the process parameters used in the PBF fabrication of Ti-6Al-4V have previously been reported, this study presents data regarding important surface characteristics over a large process window, reflecting the full capabilities of current PBF machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2970435916,"The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the effects of single and repeated intra-articular administration of allogeneic, umbilical cord-derived, neonatal mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in horses with lameness due to osteoarthritis (OA) of a metacarpophalangeal joint (MPJ). Twenty-eight horses were included. Horses were divided into two groups. Horses in group MSC1 received an MSC injection at M0 and a placebo injection at M1 (1 month after M0). Horses in group MSC2 received MSC injections at M0 and at M1. Joint injections were performed with a blinded syringe. Clinical assessment was performed by the treating veterinarian at M1, M2 and M6 (2 and 6 months after M0), including lameness evaluation, palpation and flexion of the joint. Radiographic examination of the treated joints was performed at inclusion and repeated at M6. Radiographs were anonymized and assessed by 2 ECVDI LA associate members. Short term safety assessment was performed by owner survey. A 2-month rehabilitation program was recommended to veterinarians. There was a significant improvement of the total clinical score for horses in both groups. There was no significant difference in the total clinical score between groups MSC1 and MSC2 at any time point in the study. There was no significant difference in the total radiographic OA score, osteophyte score, joint space width score and subchondral bone score between inclusion and M6. Owner-detected adverse effects to MSC injection were recorded in 18% of the horses. Lameness caused by OA improved significantly over the 6-month duration of the study after treatment with allogeneic neonatal umbilical cord-derived MSCs combined with 8 weeks rest and rehabilitation. There is no apparent clinical benefit of repeated intra-articular administration of MSCs at a 1-month interval in horses with MPJ OA when compared to the effect of a single injection."
https://openalex.org/W2971208969,"Deficits in general emotion regulation skills have been shown to be associated with various mental disorders. Thus, general affect-regulation training has been proposed as promising transdiagnostic approach to the treatment of psychopathology. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a general affect-regulation as a stand-alone, group-based treatment for depression. For this purpose, we randomly assigned 218 individuals who met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) to the Affect Regulation Training (ART), to a waitlist control condition (WLC), or to a condition controlling for common factors (CFC). The primary outcome was the course of depressive symptom severity as assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Beck Depression Inventory. Multi-level analyses indicated that participation in ART was associated with a greater reduction of depressive symptom severity than was participation in WLC (d = 0.56), whereas the slight superiority of ART over CFC (d = 0.25) was not statistically significant. Mediation analyses indicated that changes in emotion regulation skills mediated the differences between ART/CFC and WLC. Thus, the findings provide evidence for enhancing emotion regulation skills as a common mechanism of change in psychological treatments for depression. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01330485) and was supported by grants from the German Research Association (DFG; BE 4510/3-1; HI 456/6-2). Future research should compare the (cost-) efficacy of ART with that of disorder-specific interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2970327535,"Antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter, common in poultry, is a global public health issue. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistant Campylobacter has been linked to the use of antimicrobials in food animals. Small poultry flocks are becoming increasingly popular not only as a source of food but also as pets, yet not all small flock owners are aware of proper antimicrobial use practices and safe food handling protocols. This trend could contribute to antimicrobial resistance. In order to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter in small poultry flocks, we analyzed data from birds that had been submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in Ontario between October 2015 and September 2017. A pooled cecal sample was obtained from each submission and cultured for Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. Three isolates were recovered from each positive sample and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobials using a broth microdilution method. Overall, 176 isolates were recovered (141 chicken, 21 turkey, 6 duck, and 8 game bird). A high frequency of resistance to tetracycline was observed in the C. jejuni isolates from chickens (77%) and turkeys (100%), and in the C. coli isolates from turkeys (50%) and game birds (40%). Campylobacter jejuni isolates had higher odds of resistance to tetracycline (OR = 3.54, P ≤ 0.01) compared to C. coli isolates. Overall, there was a low frequency of resistance to quinolones and a very low frequency of resistance to macrolides. Multidrug resistance was uncommon. The high prevalence of tetracycline resistance emphasizes the importance of prudent antimicrobial use in small flocks. Although low, the presence of resistance to macrolides and quinolones, which are used to treat campylobacteriosis in humans, highlights the need for proper food safety and infection control practices by small flock owners to prevent exposure to antimicrobial resistant Campylobacter."
https://openalex.org/W2970537731,"Prenatal antibiotic exposure induces changes in infants' gut microbiota composition and is suggested as a possible contributor in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In this study, we examined the association between prenatal antibiotic exposure and the risk of ASD.This was a population-based cohort study utilizing the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository. The cohort included 214 834 children born in Manitoba, Canada between April 1, 1998 and March 31, 2016. Exposure was defined as having filled one or more antibiotic prescription during pregnancy. The outcome was autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the risk of developing ASD in the overall cohort and in a sibling cohort.Of all subjects, 80 750 (37.6%) were exposed to antibiotics prenatally. During follow-up, 2965 children received an ASD diagnosis. Compared to children who were not exposed to antibiotics prenatally, those who were exposed had a higher risk of ASD: (adjusted HR 1.10 [95% CI 1.01, 1.19]). The association was observed in those exposed to antibiotics in the second or third trimester (HR 1.11 [95% CI 1.01, 1.23] and 1.17 [95% CI 1.06, 1.30], respectively). In the siblings' cohort, ASD risk estimate remained unchanged (adjusted HR 1.08 [95% CI 0.90, 1.30], although it was not statistically significant.Prenatal antibiotic exposure is associated with a small increase in the risk of ASD. Given the potential of residual confounding beyond what it was controlled through our study design and because of possible confounding by indication, such a small risk increase in the population is not expected to be clinically significant."
https://openalex.org/W2970914971,"In patients at metabolic risk, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a strong and highly prevalent predictor for type 2 diabetes. Its assessment in clinical practice is not easy but the fatty liver index (FLI) could be used as a surrogate. Here, we studied the association between the FLI and the conversion to new-onset diabetes (NOD) or prediabetes reversion in patients with prediabetes.The IT-DIAB observational study included 389 individuals with prediabetes, defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 110 and 125 mg/dL. NOD conversion was defined as a first FPG value ≥ 126 mg/dL and prediabetes reversion as a first FPG value < 110 mg/dL. The associations of both events with baseline FLI were studied separately using multivariate Cox models.After a median follow-up of 3.9 years (range 0.1-6.1), 138 individuals (35.5%) converted to NOD. FLI was associated with a higher risk of NOD conversion (unadjusted HR per SD = 1.54, 95%CI 1.27-1.86, p<0.0001), even after multiple adjustment on FPG, HbA1c and diabetes risk score (adjusted HR per SD 1.31, 95%CI 1.07-1.61, p = 0.008). FLI was also associated with prediabetes reversion: adjusted HR per SD = 0.85, 95%CI 0.75-0.96, p = 0.0077. Changes in FLI were significantly associated with changes in FPG during follow-up (p<0.0001). When compared to a full model including the diabetes risk score, FPG, HbA1C and FLI, only HbA1C added a significant prediction information (AUROC: 72.8% for full model vs 69.4% for the model without HbA1C; p = 0.028), while the removal of FLI to the full model did not alter its predictive value (AUROC 72.2%). The predictive value for NOD conversion was not significantly better for HOMA-IR compared to FLI (AUROC: 69.3 vs 63.7%, p = 0.067).FLI is a simple, practical score to further stratify the risk of conversion to NOD or the possibility of prediabetes reversion in clinical practice, independently of classical glucose parameters.ClincialTrials.gov number NCT01218061 and NCT01432509."
https://openalex.org/W2970768110,"Gestational diabetes (GDM) is often accompanied by maternal overweight. Our aim was to evaluate the separate and concomitant effects of GDM and maternal overweight/obesity on perinatal outcomes.We used the Finnish Medical Birth Register to identify all 24,577 women with a singleton pregnancy who delivered in 2009 in Finland and underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Women were divided into groups according to the result of OGTT (GDM/no GDM) and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI): normal weight (≤24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (≥30.0 kg/m2). Primary outcomes included macrosomia, caesarean delivery, and treatment at neonatal ward. Normal weight women without GDM constituted the reference group.Compared to reference group, overweight or obese women without GDM had an increased risk of macrosomia [odds ratio adjusted for age, parity, smoking and socio-economic status (aOR)1.18 (95% CI 1.09-1.28) and 1.50 (95% CI 1.19-1.88)], and caesarean delivery [aORs 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.28) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.37-1.69)], respectively. In normal weight GDM women the risk of macrosomia [aOR 1.17 (95% CI 0.85-1.62)] and caesarean delivery [aOR 1.10 (95% CI 0.96-1.27)] was not significantly increased as compared to normal weight women without GDM. GDM increased the risk of treatment at neonatal ward in all BMI categories and maternal obesity without GDM was also a risk factor for treatment at neonatal ward. Interaction p values between BMI and GDM on these outcomes were <0.001.Maternal overweight and obesity without GDM increased the risk of macrosomia and caesarean delivery when compared to the reference group. These risks were amplified when overweight/obesity was accompanied by GDM. Obesity without GDM was a risk factor for treatment at neonatal ward; GDM increased this risk in all BMI categories. Our results suggest that especially maternal obesity should be considered as a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes and GDM further amplifies this risk."
https://openalex.org/W2970465452,"Background Chronic systemic inflammation is an important causative factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, the effect of chronic Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection on arterial stiffness, a predictor of cardiovascular events, remains unclear. We evaluated the association between Hp infection and arterial stiffness in asymptomatic healthy individuals. Methods Arterial stiffness was evaluated using the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI). We included subjects who underwent CAVI and anti-Hp IgG antibody evaluations, simultaneously, between March 2013 and July 2017. Demographic characteristics and metabolic and cardiovascular parameters were compared with respect to anti-Hp IgG antibody status. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the effect of Hp-seropositivity and conventional cardiovascular risk factors on arterial stiffness. Results Of 2,251 subjects, 1,326 (58.9%) were included in the Hp-seropositive group. Median age (P < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure (P = 0.027) were significantly higher in the Hp-seropositive than in the Hp-seronegative group. Levels of LDL-cholesterol were significantly higher in the Hp-seropositive than in the Hp-seronegative group (P = 0.016). Other serum metabolic parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. The median CAVI value and the proportion of subjects with a CAVI ≥ 8 were significantly higher in the Hp-seropositive than in the Hp-seronegative group (both P < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression analyses, Hp-seropositivity, age, body mass index, waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia were significantly associated with high CAVI values. In the subgroup analysis conducted according to age group, a tendency towards an increased association between Hp-seropositivity and CAVI was observed with increasing age, even though the difference did not reach the statistical significance. Conclusions Hp-seropositivity was significantly associated with arterial stiffness. Hp infection may contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2970970191,"Syzygium cumini (S. cumini) is an evergreen tropical plant that is well recognized for its therapeutic potential of common diseases. In this study, the therapeutic potential and biomedical application of S. cumini are assessed in vitro and in vivo to find its effectiveness for different complications. The methanolic crude extract of S. cumini leaves were screened for total phenolic and flavonoid content. In vitro, the DPPH scavenging assay, XTT assay, prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time were used to assess antioxidant, cytoprotective and thrombolytic activity of the S. cumini extract, respectively. The anti-inflammatory potential and the analgesic activity of the S. cumini extract were analyzed in rabbits by the Carrageenan induced paw edema method and the writhing method, respectively. Phytochemical analysis showed the presence of considerable amounts of total phenolic (369.75 ± 17.9 mg GAE/g) and flavonoid (75.8 ± 5.3 mgRE/g) content in the S. cumini extract. The DPPH assay demonstrated a higher antioxidant potential (IC-50 value of 133 μg/ml), which was comparable to the IC-50 of ascorbic acid (122.4 μg/ml). Moreover, the S. cumini extract showed a dose dependent cytoprotective effect against H2O2 treated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). S. cumini also possesses significant anticoagulant activity with a prothrombin time of 28.3 ± 1.8 seconds vs 15.8 ± 0.2 seconds of control, p<0.05. The leaf extract also demonstrated an analgesic effect in rabbits as indicated by the decrease in writhing (12.2 ± 1.7 control vs. 3.7 ± 0.6 treated) and anti-inflammatory activity in rabbits paw with a protection against inflammation of 64.1 ± 2.4%. Our findings suggest that the methanolic extract of S. cumini leaves has antioxidant, cytoprotective, anticoagulant, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, and therefore, can be applied for treating cardiovascular diseases and cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2971224745,"Introduction Telomeres and telomerase play important role in maintaining chromosome integrity and genomic stability. Recent epidemiologic data showed inconsistent findings which suggested that both short and long leukocyte telomeres could be associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. We prospectively examined the association between telomere length and pancreatic cancer risk in a population-based cohort study. Methods The Singapore Chinese Health Study recruited 63,257 Chinese aged 45 to 74 years from 1993 to 1998 in Singapore. Relative telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes was quantified using a validated monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction method in 26,540 participants, including 116 participants who later developed pancreatic cancer after an average of 13 years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard regression method was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of pancreatic cancer risk associated with telomere length, with adjustment for confounding factors. Results Longer telomeres were significantly associated with higher risk of pancreatic cancer (Ptrend = 0.02). Compared with lowest quartile, subjects with highest quartile of telomere length had an HR of 2.18 (95% CI: 1.25–3.80) for developing pancreatic cancer. In stratified analysis, this association remained among pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients but not among pancreatic non-adenocarcinoma patients. In continuous scale, the HRs and 95% CIs were 3.08 (1.17–8.11) for adenocarcinoma patients and 1.47 (0.43–5.06) for non-adenocarcinoma patients. The HRs and 95% CIs of the highest quartile of telomere length, compared with the lowest quartile, for adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma were 2.50 (1.22–5.13) and 1.63 (0.66–4.03), respectively. The length of follow-up from the collection of blood for the measurement of telomere length to the diagnosis of cancer (median = 8.0, range: from 5.0 months to 16.2 years) had no significant impact on the association between telomere length and pancreatic cancer risk. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that longer telomeres are associated with increased risk of overall pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2970863592,"Objective Advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is commonly treated with vascular endothelial growth factor or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. As new therapies emerge, interest grows in gaining a deeper understanding of treatment sequences. Recently, we developed a patient-level, discretely integrated condition event (DICE) simulation to estimate survival and lifetime costs for various cancer therapies, using a US payer perspective. Using this model, we explored the impact of treatments such as nivolumab and cabozantinib, and compared the clinical outcomes and cost consequences of commonly used treatment algorithms for patients with advanced RCC. Methods Included treatment sequences were pazopanib or sunitinib as first-line treatment, followed by nivolumab, cabozantinib, axitinib, pazopanib or everolimus. Efficacy inputs were derived from the CheckMate 025 trial and a network meta-analysis based on available literature. Safety and cost data were obtained from publicly available sources or literature. Results Based on our analysis, the average cost per life-year (LY) was lowest for sequences including nivolumab (sunitinib → nivolumab, $75,268/LY; pazopanib → nivolumab, $84,459/LY) versus axitinib, pazopanib, everolimus and cabozantinib as second-line treatments. Incremental costs per LY gained were $49,592, $73,927 and $30,534 for nivolumab versus axitinib, pazopanib and everolimus-containing sequences, respectively. The model suggests that nivolumab offers marginally higher life expectancy at a lower cost versus cabozantinib-including sequences. Conclusion Treatment sequences using nivolumab in the second-line setting are less costly compared with sequential use of targeted agents. In addition to efficacy and safety data, cost considerations may be taken into account when considering treatment algorithms for patients with advanced RCC."

https://openalex.org/W2970511185,"For women of reproductive age, overweight and obesity are an established risk factor for several medical complications. To address the increasing rate of obesity in India through public health awareness programs, the association between common behaviors and overweight and obesity needs to be investigated. This study aims to determine whether there is any association between the frequency of television watching and overweight and obesity among women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in India.This is a cross-sectional study that utilized data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), which utilized a nationally representative sample from all 29 states and 7 union territories of India. The survey itself followed a two-staged stratified random sampling technique. The primary outcome of interest was overweight (23.0 kg/m2 to <27.5 kg/m2) and obesity (≥27.5 kg/m2), measured by using the Asian body mass index cut-off. The major explanatory variable was the frequency of television watching, measured in days per week. Sample weight of NFHS-4 was adjusted during the analysis. Multilevel ordered logistic regression was conducted to identify the factors associated with overweight and obesity. To show the strength of association, both the unadjusted Crude Odds Ratio (COR) and the Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) were reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI). A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.The analysis included weighted data from 644,006 Indian women of reproductive age (15-49 years). Among the respondents, 33.5% were overweight or obese (BMI ≥23.0 kg/m2). The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased with age (p-value <0.0001) and almost half of the women aged 35-49 years were either overweight or obese (48.6%). The prevalence was significantly higher among those living in an urban area compared to a rural area (urban 46.5% vs. rural 26.5%; p-value <0.001). The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased with the frequency of watching television and was the highest among the individuals who reported watching television almost every day (p-value <0.0001). Women watching television almost every day had 24% (AOR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.21-1.26; p-value <0.001) increased odds of being overweight and obese compared to their counterparts who never watched television.This study found that the likelihood of being overweight and obese significantly increased with the frequency of watching television; likely due to physical inactivity during leisure time. Further studies should examine the physical activity and food habits of this target group. Public health promotion programs in India should raise awareness regarding the harmful effects of the sedentary lifestyle associated with watching television."
https://openalex.org/W2970372580,"Although the efforts to develop vaccine against Toxoplasma gondii infection were made for decades, there is currently no licensed vaccine available for humans. Upon discovering a number of T or B cell epitope regions from T. gondii IMC, ROP18 and MIC8, multi-antigen VLPs or combination VLPs were generated. Mice immunized with multi-antigen VLPs or combination VLPs were challenge infected with T. gondii (ME49). T. gondii-specific IgG, IgG isotypes and IgA antibody responses, memory T and B cell responses and protection were evaluated. All the mice survived upon T. gondii challenge infection by multi-antigen VLPs vaccination. Vaccinated mice elicited higher levels of parasite-specific IgG and IgG2a antibody responses in sera, IgA antibody responses in feces, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, and cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-10) responses compared to combination VLPs. In particular, the multi-antigen VLPs vaccination showed significantly higher levels of antibody secreting cell (ASC) responses, CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells, and memory B cells than combination VLPs.

https://openalex.org/W2970319323,"The drivers of latitudinal differences in the phylogenetic and ecological composition of communities are increasingly studied and understood, but still little is known about the factors underlying morphological differences. High-resolution, three-dimensional morphological data collected using computerized micro-tomography (micro-CT) allows comprehensive comparisons of morphological diversity across latitude. Using marine bivalves as a model system, this study combines 3D shape analysis (based on a new semi-automated procedure for placing landmarks and semilandmarks on shell surfaces) with non-shape traits: centroid size, proportion of shell to soft-tissue volume, and magnitude of shell ornamentation. Analyses conducted on the morphology of 95% of all marine bivalve species from two faunas along the Atlantic coast of North America, the tropical Florida Keys and the boreal Gulf of Maine, show that morphological shifts between these two faunas, and in phylogenetic and ecological subgroups shared between them, occur as changes in total variance with a bounded minimum rather than directional shifts. The dispersion of species in shell-shape morphospace is greater in the Gulf of Maine, which also shows a lower variance in ornamentation and size than the Florida Keys, but the faunas do not differ significantly in the ratio of shell to internal volume. Thus, regional differences conform to hypothesized effects of resource seasonality and predation intensity, but not to carbonate saturation or calcification costs. The overall morphological differences between the regional faunas is largely driven by the loss of ecological functional groups and family-level clades at high latitudes, rather than directional shifts in morphology within the shared groups with latitude. Latitudinal differences in morphology thus represent a complex integration of phylogenetic and ecological factors that are best captured in multivariate analyses across several hierarchical levels."

We therefore conducted a prospective study intended to evaluate pain level in adult patients undergoing BMA at the sternal or iliac crest site to identify factors associated with pain. We enrolled a total of 448 patients who underwent 461 BMA and asked those patients to score their pain intensity after BMA using numerical pain rating scale (NPRS). The following factors: level of anxiety, quality of the information given to the patient, operator’s experience, and bone texture were recorded using a standardized questionnaire. The median NPRS score was 3.5 (IQR [2.0; 5.0]) the sternal site (n = 405) was associated with an increased median NPRS score (3.5 [2.0; 5.0]) compared to the iliac crest (n = 56, 2.5 [1.0; 4.0]; p<0.0001). For those patients who underwent sternal BMA, the median NPRS score was significantly lower when using lidocaine infiltration (p = 0.0159) as compared with no anesthetic use. Additionally there was no significant effect of anesthetic cream found. After multivariate analysis, the model of NPRS score at the sternal site included patient anxiety (p<0.0001) and the use of lidocaine infiltration (0.0378). This study underlines the usefulness of a comprehensive management including pain relief and efforts to reduce anxiety including appropriate information given to the patient during BMA."
https://openalex.org/W2970444380,"TLQP-21, a peptide encoded by the highly conserved vgf gene, is expressed in neuroendocrine cells and has been the most prominent VGF-derived peptide studied in relation to control of energy balance. The recent discovery that TLQP-21 is the natural agonist for the complement 3a receptor 1 (C3aR1) has revived interest in this peptide as a potential drug target for obesity. We have investigated its function in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), a rodent that displays natural seasonal changes in body weight and adiposity as an adaptation to survive winter. We have previously shown that intracerebroventricular administration of TLQP-21 reduced food intake and body weight in hamsters in their long-day fat state. The aim of our current study was to determine the systemic actions of TLQP-21 on food intake, energy expenditure and body weight, and to establish whether adiposity affected these responses. Peripheral infusion of TLQP-21 (1mg/kg/day for 7 days) in lean hamsters exposed to short photoperiods (SP) reduced cumulative food intake in the home cage (p<0.05), and intake when measured in metabolic cages (P<0.01). Energy expenditure was significantly increased (p<0.001) by TLQP-21 infusion, this was associated with a significant increase in uncoupling protein 1 mRNA in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (p<0.05), and body weight was significantly reduced (p<0.05). These effects of systemic TLQP-21 treatment were not observed in hamsters exposed to long photoperiod (LP) with a fat phenotype. C3aR1 mRNA and protein were abundantly expressed in the hypothalamus, brown and white adipose tissue in hamsters, but changes in expression cannot explain the differential response to TLQP-21 in lean and fat hamsters."

Whether liver derived iPSCs (Li-iPSCs) would allow the generation of more fully differentiated HLCs is not known. Methods In the current study, we used primary liver cells (PLCs) expanded from liver needle biopsies and reprogrammed them into Li-iPSCs using a non-integrative Sendai virus-based system. Li-iPSCs were differentiated into HLCs using established differentiation protocols. The HLC phenotype was characterized at the protein, functional and transcriptional level. RNA sequencing data were generated from the originating liver biopsies, the Li-iPSCs, fibroblast derived iPSCs, and differentiated HLCs, and used to characterize and compare their transcriptome profiles. Results Li-iPSCs indeed retain a liver specific transcriptional footprint. Li-iPSCs can be propagated to provide an unlimited supply of cells for differentiation into Li-HLCs. Similar to HLCs derived from fibroblasts, Li-HLCs could not be fully differentiated into hepatocytes. Relative to the originating liver, Li-HLCs showed lower expression of liver specific transcription factors and increased expression of genes involved in the differentiation of other tissues. Conclusions PLCs and Li-iPSCs obtained from small pieces of human needle liver biopsies constitute a novel unlimited source for the production of HLCs. Despite the preservation of a liver specific gene expression footprint in Li-iPSCs, the generation of fully differentiated hepatocytes cannot be achieved with the current differentiation protocols."

Developing novel drugs based on new molecular targets that previously were not targeted, is therefore the highest priority in antibiotics research. One approach that has been recently suggested is to inhibit copper transporters in prokaryotic systems. Copper is required for many biological pathways, but sometimes it can harm the cell. Pathogenic systems have a highly sophisticated copper-regulation network; therefore, a better understanding of how this network operates at the molecular level should assist in developing the next generation of antibiotics. The CusB protein is part of the CusCBA periplasmic Cu(I) efflux system in Gram-negative bacteria, and was recently reported to play a key role in the functioning of the whole CusCBA system, in which conformational changes as well as the assembly/disassembly process control the opening of the transporter. More knowledge of the underlying mechanism is needed to attain a full understanding of CusB functioning, which is associated with targeting specific and crucial residues in CusB. Here, we combine in-vitro structural measurements, which use EPR spectroscopy and UV-Vis measurements, with cell experiments to explore the role of the various methionine residues in CusB. We targeted two methionine residues (M227 and M241) that are essential for the proper functioning of CusB."
https://openalex.org/W2970198603,"Background Heparin-binding protein (HBP) is released by neutrophils upon activation, and elevated plasma levels are seen in inflammatory states like sepsis, shock, cardiac arrest, and burns. However, little is known about the elimination of HBP. We wanted to study renal clearance of HBP in healthy individuals and in burn patients in intensive care units (ICUs). We also wished to examine the levels of HBP in the effluent of renal replacement circuits in ICU patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Methods We measured plasma and urine levels of HBP and urine flow rate in 8 healthy individuals and 20 patients in a burn ICU. In 32 patients on CRRT, we measured levels of HBP in plasma and in the effluent of the CRRT circuit. Results Renal clearance of HBP (median (IQR) ml/min) was 0.19 (0.08–0.33) in healthy individuals and 0.30 (0.01–1.04) in burn ICU patients. In ICU patients with cystatin C levels exceeding 1.44 mg/l, clearance was 0.45 (0.15–2.81), and in patients with cystatin C below 1.44 mg/l clearance was lower 0.28 (0.14–0.55) (p = 0.04). Starting CRRT did not significantly alter plasma levels of HBP (p = 0.14), and the median HBP level in the effluent on CRRT was 9.1 ng/ml (IQR 7.8–14.4 ng/ml). Conclusion In healthy individuals and critically ill burn patients, renal clearance of HBP is low. It is increased when renal function is impaired. Starting CRRT in critically ill patients does not alter plasma levels of HBP significantly, but HBP can be found in the effluent. It seems unlikely that impaired kidney function needs to be considered when interpreting concentrations of HBP in previous studies. Starting CRRT does not appear to be an effective way of reducing HBP concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2970774509,"Living vegetation volume (LVV), one of the most difficult tree parameters to calculate, is among the most important factors that indicates the biological characteristics and ecological functions of the crown. Obtaining precise LVV estimates is, however, challenging task because the irregularities of many crown shapes are difficult to capture using standard forestry field equipment. Terrestrial light detection and ranging (T-LiDAR) can be used to record the three-dimensional structures of trees. The primary branches of Larix olgensis and Quercus mongolica in the Qingyuan Experimental Station of Forest Ecology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) were taken as the research objects. A new rapid LVV estimation method called the filling method was proposed in this paper based on a T-LiDAR point cloud. In the proposed method, the branch point clouds are divided into leaf points and wood points. We used RiSCAN PRO 1.64 to manually separate the leaf points and wood points under careful visual inspection, and calculated that leaf points and wood points accounted for 91% and 9% of the number of the point clouds of branches. Then, the equation LVV = V1N (where N is the number of leaf points, and V1 is cube size) is used to calculate LVV. When the laser transmission frequency is 300,000 points/second and the point cloud is diluted to 30% using the octree method, the point cloud can be replaced by a cube (V1) of 6.11 cm3 to fill the branch space. The results showed that good performance for this approach, the measuring accuracy for L. olgensis and Q. mongolica at the levels of α = 0.05 and α = 0.01, respectively (94.35%, 90.01% and 91.99%, 85.63%, respectively). The results suggest that the proposed method can be conveniently used to calculate the LVV of coniferous and broad-leaf species under specific scanning settings. This work is explorative because hypotheses or a theoretical framework have not been previously defined. Rather, we would like to contribute to the formation of hypotheses as a background for further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2971242945,"Background Widespread use of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic resistance. However, there are limited data describing antibiotic use in the community setting, and examining factors associated with greater use. Our study aimed to quantify antibiotic dispensing in older adults in the community according to socio-demographics and health services use. Methods Prospective analysis of a population-based cohort study of 239,981 adults aged ≥45 years in Australia (the Sax Institute’s 45 and Up Study). Data on socio-demographics and health from a questionnaire, were linked to 2015 antibiotic dispensing data from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), as well as other administrative health databases. We estimated the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) of systemic antibiotics dispensed, defined by an Anatomic Therapeutic Classification code beginning with J01, in 2015. We also conducted Poisson regression with robust standard errors to identify factors associated with antibiotic dispensing. Results Overall, 49.3% of 45 and Up Study participants had at least one systemic antibiotic dispensed in 2015 with a total of 392,856 prescriptions dispensed and an average of 36.5 DDDs/1000-persons/day in the study population. The quantity of antibiotics dispensed increased with increasing age (25.6 DDDs/1000/day in <60 years old versus 50.4 DDDs/1000/day in 80+ year old) and was higher comparing women to men (39.9 versus 32.4 DDDs/1000/day). Of factors examined, the greatest dispensing of antibiotics was among those who had been resident in an aged care facility and those with >15 general practitioner consultations in the last year (80.5 and 88.3 DDDs/1000/day, respectively). These factors remained strongly associated with greater antibiotic dispensing after adjusting for age, sex, education, income, area of residence and co-morbidities. Conclusions Residence in aged care facilities and high GP visits are associated with greater antibiotic dispensing. This study provides important evidence regarding high use groups for antimicrobial stewardship."

However, only two cultures assigned to this morphospecies have been examined using molecular methods, and their 18S rRNA gene sequences are extremely different. Further the salinity tolerances of individual strains are unknown. Thus, our knowledge on the autecology and diversity in this morphospecies is deficient. Here, we report 18S rRNA gene data on seven strains similar to P. cosmopolitus from seven geographically remote locations (New Zealand, Kenya, Korea, Poland, Russia, Spain, and the USA) with sample salinities ranging from 4‰ to 280‰, and compare morphology and salinity tolerance of the nine available strains. Percolomonas cosmopolitus-like strains show few-to-no consistent morphological differences, and form six clades separated by often extremely large 18S rRNA gene divergences (up to 42.4%). Some strains grow best at salinities from 75 to 125‰ and represent halophiles. All but one of these belong to two geographically heterogeneous clusters that form a robust monophyletic group in phylogenetic trees; this likely represents an ecologically specialized subclade of halophiles. Our results suggest that P. cosmopolitus is a cluster of several cryptic species (at least), which are unlikely to be distinguished by geography. Interestingly, the 9 Percolomonas strains formed a clade in 18S rRNA gene phylogenies, unlike most previous analyses based on two sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2970335542,"The human hair follicle is a neuroendocrine mini-organ that can be used to study aging processes in vitro. Neurotrophins maintain homeostasis in hair biology via the Trk-family of receptors. TrkA, the high affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), is expressed in hair follicle melanocytes and keratinocytes, where it regulates proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and may thereby play a role in hair pigmentation and growth. We investigated TrkA expression during the human hair cycle and the effects of a selective high affinity TrkA agonist, Gambogic Amide, on hair pigmentation and hair growth in human hair follicles in vitro. In human scalp skin, TrkA expression was strongest in proliferating melanocytes re-establishing the pigmentary unit in the hair bulb during the early hair growth phase, anagen. During high anagen and in the de-composing pigmentary-unit of the regression phase, catagen, bulb-melanocytes lost TrkA expression and only undifferentiated outer root sheath melanocytes maintained it. In cultured human anagen hair follicles, Gambogic Amide was able to prevent gradual pigment loss, while it stimulated hair shaft elongation. This was achieved by increased melanocyte activation, migration and dendricity, highlighted by distinct c-KIT-expression in melanocyte sub-populations. Our results suggest that Gambogic Amide can maintain hair follicle pigmentation by acting on undifferentiated melanocytes residing in the outer root sheath and making them migrate to establish the pigmentary-unit. This suggests that the selective TrkA agonist Gambogic Amide acts as an anti-hair greying and hair growth promoting molecule in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2970430222,"The prevalence of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use has rapidly increased among young people, while conventional cigarette use has decreased in this age group. However, some evidence suggests that e-cigarette use is likely to induce conventional cigarette smoking. The present study explored the social influence of the prevalence of e-cigarette use in the peer network and in the general population as a potential mechanism by which e-cigarette use affects adolescents’ overall smoking behaviours. For this purpose, we developed an agent-based model in which young agents repeatedly choose to smoke conventional cigarettes and/or e-cigarettes, or to remain non-smokers. The choice is based on the agent’s evaluation of the utility derived from smoking and attitude towards smoking (‘openness’), which is influenced by smoking prevalence in the agent’s peer network and in the broader society. We also assumed a ‘crossover’ effect between the different types of smoking. The model was calibrated with United States National Youth Tobacco Survey data to reflect real-world numbers. We further simulated the prevalence of different types of smoking under counterfactual scenarios with different levels of openness and crossover effects. The models developed successfully reproduced actual prevalence trends in different types of smoking from 2011 to 2014. Openness to smoking is associated with a dramatic increase in e-cigarette smoking and especially in dual smoking, which cancels out the decline in sole conventional smoking. Larger crossover effects are associated with a higher prevalence of conventional smoking. The simulation results indicate that the social influence of the prevalence of e-cigarette use may influence young people to initiate or continue conventional cigarette smoking. Assessing the impact of e-cigarettes in the general population as a ‘healthier’ alternative to conventional smoking may require carefully monitoring trends in young people’s smoking behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2970744038,"Background Large numbers of young people die yearly due to homicide, but little is known about homicide during adolescence. Research primarily focuses on youth violence among young men and masks important gender-related factors inherent in the adolescent age group. Although young women are less likely to be victims of homicide, violence against women is an important form of violence experienced during adolescence. In this paper, we describe the prevalence of and gender difference in adolescent homicide in South Africa in 2009. Methods We conducted a retrospective national mortuary-based study to identify all child homicides (boys and girls < 18 years) in 2009 in a proportionate sample of mortuaries. Victim, perpetrator and crime data were collected in three phases: cases were identified from the mortuary register, the autopsy report and from police interviews. In this paper we focus on the adolescent group, aged 10 to 17 years. Findings We identified 674 (95% CI: 520–823) adolescent homicides for 2009, with more male (520) than female (154) homicides. This gender disparity increased as children aged, with the male homicide rate 27.9/100 000 population (95% CI: 20.3–35.5), nearly 5 times the female rate (4.5:1) of 6.5/ 100 000 population (95% CI: 4.7–8.2) in older adolescents (15–17 year old). Adolescent males were significantly more likely (61.2%) to die in a public space compared to female adolescents (39.3%) but more adolescent females (48.4%) died at home compared to adolescent males (32.9%). Adolescent females (42.1%) were mainly killed by a family member or intimate partner while adolescent males were predominantly (58%) killed by an acquaintance. Conclusion We found a distinct gender pattern for adolescent homicide in South Africa. This pattern appears to be driven by gender norms that support violence. South Africa requires an investment in developing evidence informed interventions to reduce violence."

These essays have appeared at regular intervals in The FASEB Journal. My instructions to the researchers were simply not to emphasize Aβ per se because there had been many reviews both supporting and questioning the etiologic role of Aβ in the late-onset, sporadic form of AD, and reciting either of those scientific positions would be redundant. My colleagues responded admirably, and I believe that their contributions have significantly informed readers' awareness of the current state of knowledge of AD. I have written my epilogue from the perspective of an investigator interested in the role of protein aggregation in human disease and as a physician who may be charged with making a diagnosis and prescribing treatment for a patient. We do not yet have etiology-based therapies of AD, but we continue to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for synaptic loss and the consequent functional deterioration. A silver therapeutic bullet does not seem to be in the offing. It is more likely that an iterative approach will lead to the development of a group of treatments that are AD specific or applicable to various features of the entire class of neurodegenerative disorders. How and when those therapies succeed or fail will, in turn, provide additional insights into disease pathogenesis, which will inform the development of succeeding generations of therapeutics.-Buxbaum, J.

https://openalex.org/W2970212884,"The visualization of biological networks is critically important to aid researchers in understanding complex biological systems and arouses interest in designing efficient layout algorithms to draw biological networks according to their topology structures, especially for those networks with potential modules. The algorithms of grid layout series have an advantage in generating compact layouts with overlap-free nodes compared to force-directed; however, extant grid layout algorithms have difficulty in drawing modular networks and often generate layouts of high visual complexity when applied to networks with dense or clustered connectivity structure. To specifically assist the study of modular networks, we propose a grid- and modularity-based layout algorithm (GML) that consists of three stages: network preprocessing, module layout and grid optimization. The algorithm can draw complex biological networks with or without predefined modules based on the grid layout algorithm. It also outperforms other existing grid-based algorithms in the measurement of computation performance, ratio of edge-edge/node-edge crossings, relative edge lengths, and connectivity F-measures. GML helps users to gain insight into the network global characteristics through module layout, as well as to discern network details with grid optimization.

https://openalex.org/W2970944247,"Sensory representations in the adult brain must undergo dynamic changes to adapt to the complexity of the external world. This study investigated how passive exposure to novel sounds modifies neural representations to facilitate recognition and discrimination, using the zebra finch model organism. The neural responses in an auditory structure in the zebra finch brain, Caudal Medial Nidopallium (NCM), undergo a long-term form of adaptation with repeated stimulus presentation, providing an excellent substrate to probe the neural underpinnings of adaptive sensory representations. In Experiment 1, electrophysiological activity in NCM was recorded under passive listening conditions as novel natural vocalizations were familiarized through playback. Neural decoding of stimuli using the temporal profiles of both single-unit and multi-unit responses improved dramatically during the first few stimulus presentations. During subsequent encounters, these signals were recognized after hearing fewer initial acoustic features. Remarkably, the accuracy of neural decoding was higher when different stimuli were heard in separate blocks compared to when they were presented randomly in a shuffled sequence. NCM neurons with narrow spike waveforms generally yielded higher neural decoding accuracy than wide spike neurons, but the rate at which these accuracies improved with passive exposure was comparable between the two neuron types. Experiment 2 supported and extended these findings by showing that the rapid gains in neural decoding of novel vocalizations with passive familiarization were long-lasting, maintained for 20 hours after the initial encounter, in multi-unit responses. Taken together, these findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which the nervous system dynamically modulates sensory representations to improve discrimination of novel complex signals over short and long timescales. Similar mechanisms may also be engaged during processing of human speech signals, and thus may have potential translational relevance for elucidating the neural basis of speech comprehension difficulties."
https://openalex.org/W2970486390,"Ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury can cause acute kidney injury. It has previously been reported that kidney oxygen consumption (QO2) in relation to glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and thus tubular sodium load, is markedly increased following IR injury, indicating reduced electrolyte transport efficiency. Since proximal tubular sodium reabsorption (TNa) is a major contributor to overall kidney QO2, we investigated whether inhibition of proximal tubular sodium transport through carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition would improve renal oxygenation following ischemia reperfusion. Anesthetized adult male Sprague Dawley rats were administered the CA inhibitor acetazolamide (50 mg/kg bolus iv), or volume-matched vehicle, and kidney function, hemodynamics and QO2 were estimated before and after 45 minutes of unilateral complete warm renal ischemia. CA inhibition per se reduced GFR (-20%) and TNa (-22%), while it increased urine flow and urinary sodium excretion (36-fold). Renal blood flow was reduced (-31%) due to increased renal vascular resistance (+37%) without affecting QO2. IR per se resulted in similar decrease in GFR and TNa, independently of CA activity. However, the QO2/TNa ratio following ischemia-reperfusion was profoundly increased in the group receiving CA inhibition, indicating a significant contribution of basal oxygen metabolism to the total kidney QO2 following inhibition of proximal tubular function after IR injury. Ischemia increased urinary excretion of kidney injury molecule-1, an effect that was unaffected by CA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that CA inhibition further impairs renal oxygenation and does not protect tubular function in the acute phase following IR injury. Furthermore, these results indicate a major role of the proximal tubule in the acute recovery from an ischemic insult."

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to measure the concentration of suPAR in the hepatic vein of cirrhotic patients during a liver vein catheterization to identify a possible hepatic suPAR generation. Furthermore, we explored if suPAR levels were associated with the degree of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction.We included 105 cirrhotic patients and 19 liver-healthy controls. Blood was sampled from the hepatic vein and the femoral artery and suPAR was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.We identified significantly higher median suPAR concentrations among the cirrhotic patients (7.2 ng/ml in the hepatic vein; 6.8 ng/ml in the femoral artery) compared to the controls (2.6 ng/ml, respectively, p-values <0.001). However, the median hepatic suPAR formation was 0.0 ng/ml in both groups. We observed significantly increasing suPAR levels according to higher Child classes (4.5 ng/ml, 6.9 ng/ml and 9.0 ng/ml, Child A, B, C respectively; p-value<0.001), and significantly higher median suPAR concentrations in patients with ascites versus patients without ascites (8.1 ng/ml versus 5.3 ng/ml, respectively, p-value<0.001). suPAR levels were significantly related to bilirubin (r = 0.48, p<0.001), the hepatic venous pressure gradient (r = 0.39, p<0.001), the cardiac index (r = 0.24, p = 0.02) and the plasma volume (r = 0.33, p = 0.001), whereas suPAR levels were significantly inversely related to albumin (r = -0.59, p<0.001), plasma coagulation factors (r-0.39, p<0.001), the mean arterial pressure (r = -0.28, p = 0.004), the systemic vascular resistance (r = 0.26, p = 0.007), the indocyanine green clearance (r = -0.51, p<0,001) and the galactose elimination capacity (r = -0.39, p<0.001).We identified elevated suPAR concentration in cirrhotic patients, which correlated significantly with the degree of cirrhosis and liver failure, but we were not able to demonstrate hepatic suPAR generation per se.

In the first part, three- and five-year-old children (N = 120) decided between a fair and an unfair wheel of fortune to allocate resources (procedural justice). In the second part, they directly chose between two distributions of resources (distributive justice). While making a decision, each child was either observed by the affected group members (public), alone (private), or no others were introduced (non-social control). Children choose the fair option more often when others were affected (independently of their presence) only in the procedural justice task. These results suggest that using a fair procedure to distribute resources allows young preschoolers to overcome selfish tendencies."
https://openalex.org/W2970233504,"In response to strong selection, new mutations can arise quickly and sweep through populations, particularly, if survival and reproduction depend on certain allele copies for adaptation to rapidly changing environments, like resistance against deadly diseases or strong toxins. Since the 1950s, resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides in several rodents has emerged through single nucleotide mutations in the vitamin-K-epoxid-reductase-complex-subunit-1 (VKORC1) gene, often located in its exon 3. Detection of high prevalence and concentrations of anticoagulant rodenticides in non-target vertebrates, including carnivorous Mustelidae, let us assume that secondary exposure by feeding on poisoned prey may also cause selection along the food chain and we hypothesized that VKORC1-based resistance might also have evolved in rodents’ predators. Using newly-developed mustelid-specific primers for direct sequencing of genomic DNA, we studied VKORC1-DNA-polymorphisms in 115 mustelids of five species (Martes martes, M. foina, Mustela nivalis, M. erminea, M. putorius), obtained from northern Denmark, yielding six sites with nonsynonymous and several synonymous amino acid polymorphisms in exon 3. Comparison of these VKORC1-genotypes with hepatic rodenticide residues (obtained by HPLC combined with fluorescence or mass spectrometry) in 83 individuals (except M. martes), using generalized linear models, suggested that anticoagulant levels depended on species and specific polymorphisms. Although most VKORC-1 polymorphisms may present standing genetic variation, some are situated in resistance-mediating membrane parts of the VKORC1-encoded protein, and might be a result of selection due to exposure to anticoagulant poisons. Our new molecular markers might allow detecting indirect effects of anticoagulant rodenticides on rodent predator populations in the future."

The aim of our study was to identify Triticum aestivum L. chromosomes involved in early responses to short-term water-deficit stress (1, 3 and 6 h). In the present study, intervarietal substitution lines of drought-tolerant 'Saratovskaya 29' and sensitive 'Janetzkis Probat' wheat cultivars were examined. We studied the biochemical plant response system and conducted an analysis of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and guaiacol peroxidase activities, levels of lipid peroxidation and changes in relative water content. Our results determined that the first reaction was a significant increase in guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity. However, the strongest impact on plant responses was found for catalase (CAT), which caused a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels. Our findings indicate that chromosomes 5A, 4B, 6B and 7D are associated with early responses to short-term osmotic stress in wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2971188935,"This study aimed to investigate the optimal and safe intensity for facial nerve stimulation during middle ear surgery.Thirty-seven patients who had their facial nerve exposed prior to surgery were prospectively enrolled in this study, and electromyography (EMG) recordings were obtained from the orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris muscles. Four pigs were also enrolled in an animal study, and continuous stimulation was performed on the facial nerves of the pigs for 10 minutes. The EMG responses were measured and the pathologic outcomes of the facial nerve after stimulation were determined.In the human study, the mean intensity of the minimal electrical stimulation threshold was 0.21 mA (range: 0.1-0.3 mA). A linear correlation was observed between stimulus intensity and response amplitude for intensities below 0.4 mA. Response amplitudes reached a plateau between 0.4 mA and 1.0 mA. The minimal stimulus intensity that could generate a maximal response was 0.4 mA in the orbicularis oculi (244 μV) and orbicularis oris (545 μV). In the animal study, there were no observed changes in EMG or nerve damage incidence after the continuous stimulation of 3.0 mA.0.4 mA is considered to be the optimal intensity of facial nerve stimulation during middle ear surgery, and it was estimated through the animal study that a stimulation of 3.0 mA is safe from facial nerve damage."
https://openalex.org/W2971211046,"Genetic polymorphisms and social factors (alcohol consumption, betel quid (BQ) usage, and cigarette consumption), both separately or jointly, play a crucial role in the occurrence of oral malignant disorders such as oral and pharyngeal cancers and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD).Simultaneous analyses of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and environmental effects on oral malignant disorders are essential to examine, albeit challenging. Thus, we conducted a case-control study (N = 576) to analyze the risk of occurrence of oral malignant disorders by using binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) with an odds ratio (OR)-based method.We demonstrated that a combination of SNPs (CYP26B1 rs887844 and CYP26C1 rs12256889) and socio-demographic factors (age, ethnicity, and BQ chewing), referred to as the combined effects of SNP-environment, correlated with maximal risk diversity of occurrence observed between the oral malignant disorder group and the control group. The risks were more prominent in the oral and pharyngeal cancers group (OR = 10.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.58-23.15) than in the OPMD group (OR = 5.42; 95% CI = 1.94-15.12).Simulation-based ""SNP-environment barcodes"" may be used to predict the risk of occurrence of oral malignant disorders. Applying simulation-based ""SNP-environment barcodes"" may provide insight into the importance of screening tests in preventing oral and pharyngeal cancers and OPMD."

Existing block-based detection techniques detect forgery in the same image, most of which use similar frameworks while differ in the feature extraction schemes. These methods have high accuracy in detecting the forged regions, but the computational load is heavy when facing exhaustive search problems. This paper describes a forgery detection method based on local binary pattern residue classes and color regions. An image is divided into overlapped blocks. Local binary pattern residue classes are computed for each block. The plane formed by a dimensional and b dimensional from Lab color space is divided into 16 regions. Similar blocks are searched in the overlapped blocks with the same local binary pattern residue class and color region, then they are grouped into several suspicious regions. Finally, we analyze the multi-region relation of these suspicious regions and their areas to locate the tampered regions. The small hole is filled through the morphologic operation. The results of experiments demonstrated that our method has good performance in that it improved detection accuracy and reduced execution time under various challenging conditions. As the proposed method reduces the search range for similar blocks, it has a higher speed than exhaustive search and has comparable detection results at the same time."
https://openalex.org/W2970660347,"Recent research has shown Major League Baseball (MLB) players that bat left-handed and throw right-handed, otherwise known as sinister right-handers, are more likely to have a career batting average (BA) of .299 or higher compared to players with other combinations of batting and throwing handedness. Moreover, possibly owing to early exposure to hockey, Canadian-born MLB players have an increased propensity to be sinister right-handers, however, it has yet to be determined whether this provides a relative offensive performance advantage compared to players born in other countries. Using the largest archival dataset of MLB statistics available, the present study examined the independent influence of batting (i.e., left, right, switch) and throwing (i.e., left, right) handedness combinations and country/region of origin (i.e., Canada, USA, Latin America, Asia, Other) on several indices of offensive performance including BA, slugging percentage (SLG), on-base plus slugging (OPS), on-base plus slugging plus (OPS+), home runs (HR), runs batted in (RBI), strikeouts (SO) and wins above replacement (WAR). Mediation models were also computed to examine whether birthplace influences offensive performance through handedness. Examination of all recorded MLB batters revealed that batting left, regardless of throwing handedness, confers an offensive performance advantage. Since the inception of the MLB, the relative proportion of Canadian-born sinister right-handers is at least two times greater than players from other regions, although being Canadian-born does not provide a direct offensive advantage. Rather, results showed evidence of a significant indirect effect in that being Canadian-born increases the odds of being a sinister right-hander and in turn leads to greater performance across each offensive performance statistic. Collectively, findings provide further support for the hockey influence on batting hypothesis and suggest this effect extends to offensive performance."
