https://openalex.org/W2783667606,"Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of cancer that results from ongoing errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis. Although chromosomal instability is a major driver of tumour evolution, its role in metastasis has not been established. Here we show that chromosomal instability promotes metastasis by sustaining a tumour cell-autonomous response to cytosolic DNA. Errors in chromosome segregation create a preponderance of micronuclei whose rupture spills genomic DNA into the cytosol. This leads to the activation of the cGAS–STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes) cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and downstream noncanonical NF-κB signalling. Genetic suppression of chromosomal instability markedly delays metastasis even in highly aneuploid tumour models, whereas continuous chromosome segregation errors promote cellular invasion and metastasis in a STING-dependent manner. By subverting lethal epithelial responses to cytosolic DNA, chromosomally unstable tumour cells co-opt chronic activation of innate immune pathways to spread to distant organs. In chromosomally unstable tumour cells, rupture of micronuclei exposes genomic DNA and activates the cGAS–STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, thereby promoting metastasis. The cGAS–STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway detects the presence of double-stranded DNA in the cytosol of cells, which triggers an inflammatory response. This pathway can be activated by foreign or cellular DNA. Lewis Cantley and colleagues show that the pathway is activated in human cancer cells with chromosomal instability. Improper segregation of chromosomes during cell division leads to the formation of unstable micronuclei, which burst and release their DNA into the cytosol. The resulting inflammatory response involves activation of NF-κB signalling and promotes metastasis in a STING-dependent manner. These findings link chromosomal instability to metastasis and may offer new avenues to preventing the spread of cancer to distant organs."
https://openalex.org/W2783547662,"The ageing suppressor α-klotho binds to the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). This commits FGFR to respond to FGF23, a key hormone in the regulation of mineral ion and vitamin D homeostasis. The role and mechanism of this co-receptor are unknown. Here we present the atomic structure of a 1:1:1 ternary complex that consists of the shed extracellular domain of α-klotho, the FGFR1c ligand-binding domain, and FGF23. In this complex, α-klotho simultaneously tethers FGFR1c by its D3 domain and FGF23 by its C-terminal tail, thus implementing FGF23-FGFR1c proximity and conferring stability. Dimerization of the stabilized ternary complexes and receptor activation remain dependent on the binding of heparan sulfate, a mandatory cofactor of paracrine FGF signalling. The structure of α-klotho is incompatible with its purported glycosidase activity. Thus, shed α-klotho functions as an on-demand non-enzymatic scaffold protein that promotes FGF23 signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2782777427,"Locomotion is a fundamental motor function common to the animal kingdom. It is implemented episodically and adapted to behavioural needs, including exploration, which requires slow locomotion, and escape behaviour, which necessitates faster speeds. The control of these functions originates in brainstem structures, although the neuronal substrate(s) that support them have not yet been elucidated. Here we show in mice that speed and gait selection are controlled by glutamatergic excitatory neurons (GlutNs) segregated in two distinct midbrain nuclei: the cuneiform nucleus (CnF) and the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). GlutNs in both of these regions contribute to the control of slower, alternating-gait locomotion, whereas only GlutNs in the CnF are able to elicit high-speed, synchronous-gait locomotion. Additionally, both the activation dynamics and the input and output connectivity matrices of GlutNs in the PPN and the CnF support explorative and escape locomotion, respectively. Our results identify two regions in the midbrain that act in conjunction to select context-dependent locomotor behaviours."

https://openalex.org/W4231793812,"Canonical fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) activate FGF receptors (FGFRs) through paracrine or autocrine mechanisms in a process that requires cooperation with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which function as co-receptors for FGFR activation. By contrast, endocrine FGFs (FGF19, FGF21 and FGF23) are circulating hormones that regulate critical metabolic processes in a variety of tissues. FGF19 regulates bile acid synthesis and lipogenesis, whereas FGF21 stimulates insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure and weight loss. Endocrine FGFs signal through FGFRs in a manner that requires klothos, which are cell-surface proteins that possess tandem glycosidase domains. Here we describe the crystal structures of free and ligand-bound β-klotho extracellular regions that reveal the molecular mechanism that underlies the specificity of FGF21 towards β-klotho and demonstrate how the FGFR is activated in a klotho-dependent manner. β-Klotho serves as a primary 'zip code'-like receptor that acts as a targeting signal for FGF21, and FGFR functions as a catalytic subunit that mediates intracellular signalling. Our structures also show how the sugar-cutting enzyme glycosidase has evolved to become a specific receptor for hormones that regulate metabolic processes, including the lowering of blood sugar levels. Finally, we describe an agonistic variant of FGF21 with enhanced biological activity and present structural insights into the potential development of therapeutic agents for diseases linked to endocrine FGFs."
https://openalex.org/W2783792325,"Interactions between receptors and ligands on immune cells are visualized in vivo and in vitro using an enzyme-tagged ligand that, when cells interact, leaves behind a detectable label on the receptor-expressing cell. Gabriel Victora and colleagues describe a new approach to studying cell–cell interactions in the immune system. The method, which they called Labelling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts (LIPSTIC), relies on chemical labelling (tagging) of genetically modified receptor–ligand pairs, a process mediated by the bacterial enzyme sortase. The history of ligand–receptor interactions is revealed by the presence of reporter tags that can be detected by flow cytometry or microscopy. Using this technique, the authors observe unanticipated CD40–CD40L interactions between T cells and dendritic cells at the non-cognate stage, when the T cell receptor is no longer engaged in the interaction. The method can potentially be applied to other in vitro and in vivo systems. Interactions between different cell types are essential for multiple biological processes, including immunity, embryonic development and neuronal signalling. Although the dynamics of cell–cell interactions can be monitored in vivo by intravital microscopy1, this approach does not provide any information on the receptors and ligands involved or enable the isolation of interacting cells for downstream analysis. Here we describe a complementary approach that uses bacterial sortase A-mediated cell labelling across synapses of immune cells to identify receptor–ligand interactions between cells in living mice, by generating a signal that can subsequently be detected ex vivo by flow cytometry. We call this approach for the labelling of ‘kiss-and-run’ interactions between immune cells ‘Labelling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts’ (LIPSTIC). Using LIPSTIC, we show that interactions between dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells during T-cell priming in vivo occur in two distinct modalities: an early, cognate stage, during which CD40–CD40L interactions occur specifically between T cells and antigen-loaded dendritic cells; and a later, non-cognate stage during which these interactions no longer require prior engagement of the T-cell receptor. Therefore, LIPSTIC enables the direct measurement of dynamic cell–cell interactions both in vitro and in vivo. Given its flexibility for use with different receptor–ligand pairs and a range of detectable labels, we expect that this approach will be of use to any field of biology requiring quantification of intercellular communication."
https://openalex.org/W2783780398,"Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis. Gain-of-function mutations in the 5'-nucleotidase, cytosolic II (NT5C2) gene induce resistance to 6-mercaptopurine and are selectively present in relapsed ALL. Yet, the mechanisms involved in NT5C2 mutation-driven clonal evolution during the initiation of leukaemia, disease progression and relapse remain unknown. Here we use a conditional-and-inducible leukaemia model to demonstrate that expression of NT5C2(R367Q), a highly prevalent relapsed-ALL NT5C2 mutation, induces resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine at the cost of impaired leukaemia cell growth and leukaemia-initiating cell activity. The loss-of-fitness phenotype of NT5C2+/R367Q mutant cells is associated with excess export of purines to the extracellular space and depletion of the intracellular purine-nucleotide pool. Consequently, blocking guanosine synthesis by inhibition of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) induced increased cytotoxicity against NT5C2-mutant leukaemia lymphoblasts. These results identify the fitness cost of NT5C2 mutation and resistance to chemotherapy as key evolutionary drivers that shape clonal evolution in relapsed ALL and support a role for IMPDH inhibition in the treatment of ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2783067021,"Colon cancer constitutes one of the most frequent malignancies. Previous studies showed that Salmonella manipulates host cell signaling pathways and that Salmonella Typhimurium infection facilitates colon cancer development in genetically predisposed mice. This epidemiological study examined whether severe Salmonella infection, usually acquired from contaminated food, is associated with increased colon cancer risk in humans.We performed a nationwide registry-based study to assess colon cancer risk after diagnosed Salmonella infection. National infectious disease surveillance records (1999-2015) for Dutch residents aged ≥20 years when diagnosed with salmonellosis (n = 14,264) were linked to the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Salmonella-infected patients were laboratory-confirmed under medical consultation after 1-2 weeks of illness. These datasets also contained information on Salmonella serovar and type of infection. Colon cancer risk (overall and per colon subsite) among patients with a diagnosed Salmonella infection was compared with expected colon cancer risk in the general population. Data from the nationwide registry of histo- and cytopathology (PALGA) and Statistics Netherlands (CBS) allowed assessing potential effects of age, gender, latency, socioeconomic status, genetic predisposition, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and tumor features. We found that compared to the general population, colon cancer risk was significantly increased (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 1.54; 95%CI 1.09-2.10) among patients with Salmonella infection diagnosed <60 years of age. Such increased risk concerned specifically the ascending/transverse colon (SIR 2.12; 95%CI 1.38-3.09) after S. Enteritidis infection (SIR 2.97; 95%CI 1.73-4.76). Salmonellosis occurred more frequently among colon cancer patients with pre-infectious IBD, a known risk factor for colon cancer. Colon tumors of patients with a history of Salmonella infection were mostly of low grade.Patients diagnosed with severe salmonellosis have an increased risk of developing cancer in the ascending/transverse parts of the colon. This risk concerns particularly S. Enteritidis infection, suggesting a contribution of this major foodborne pathogen to colon cancer development."

https://openalex.org/W2784308664,"All haematopoietic cell lineages that circulate in the blood of adult mammals derive from multipotent haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). By contrast, in the blood of mammalian embryos, lineage-restricted progenitors arise first, independently of HSCs, which only emerge later in gestation. As best defined in the mouse, 'primitive' progenitors first appear in the yolk sac at 7.5 days post-coitum. Subsequently, erythroid-myeloid progenitors that express fetal haemoglobin, as well as fetal lymphoid progenitors, develop in the yolk sac and the embryo proper, but these cells lack HSC potential. Ultimately, 'definitive' HSCs with long-term, multilineage potential and the ability to engraft irradiated adults emerge at 10.5 days post-coitum from arterial endothelium in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros and other haemogenic vasculature. The molecular mechanisms of this reverse progression of haematopoietic ontogeny remain unexplained. We hypothesized that the definitive haematopoietic program might be actively repressed in early embryogenesis through epigenetic silencing, and that alleviating this repression would elicit multipotency in otherwise lineage-restricted haematopoietic progenitors. Here we show that reduced expression of the Polycomb group protein EZH1 enhances multi-lymphoid output from human pluripotent stem cells. In addition, Ezh1 deficiency in mouse embryos results in precocious emergence of functional definitive HSCs in vivo. Thus, we identify EZH1 as a repressor of haematopoietic multipotency in the early mammalian embryo."

https://openalex.org/W2788119666,"Epidemiological studies pointed out to a strong association between vitamin D deficiency and type 2 diabetes prevalence. However, the role of vitamin D supplementation in the skeletal muscle, a tissue that play a crucial role in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, has been scarcely investigated so far. On this basis, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation in a murine model of diet-induced insulin resistance with particular attention to the effects evoked on the skeletal muscle. Male C57BL/6J mice (n = 40) were fed with a control or a High Fat-High Sugar (HFHS) diet for 4 months. Subsets of animals were treated for 2 months with vitamin D (7 μg·kg-1, i.p. three times/week). HFHS diet induced body weight increase, hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance. HFHS animals showed an impaired insulin signaling and a marked fat accumulation in the skeletal muscle. Vitamin D reduced body weight and improved systemic glucose tolerance. In addition, vitamin D restored the impaired muscle insulin signaling and reverted myosteatosis evoked by the diet. These effects were associated to decreased activation of NF-κB and lower levels of TNF-alpha. Consistently, a significantly decreased activation of the SCAP/SREBP lipogenic pathway and lower levels of CML protein adducts and RAGE expression were observed in skeletal muscle of animals treated with vitamin D. Collectively, these data indicate that vitamin D-induced selective inhibition of signaling pathways (including NF-κB, SCAP/SREBP and CML/RAGE cascades) within the skeletal muscle significantly contributed to the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation against diet-induced metabolic derangements."
https://openalex.org/W2783719895,"In this paper, a new four-variable dynamical system is proposed to set chaotic circuit composed of memristor and Josephson junction, and the dependence of chaotic behaviors on nonlinearity is investigated. A magnetic flux-controlled memristor is used to couple with the RCL-shunted junction circuit, and the dynamical behaviors can be modulated by changing the coupling intensity between the memristor and the RCL-shunted junction. Bifurcation diagram and Lyapunov exponent are calculated to confirm the emergence of chaos in the improved dynamical system. The outputs and dynamical behaviors can be controlled by the initial setting and external stimulus as well. As a result, chaos can be suppressed and spiking occurs in the sampled outputs under negative feedback, while applying positive feedback type via memristor can be effective to trigger chaos. Furthermore, it is found that the number of multi-attractors in the Jerk circuit can be modulated when memristor coupling is applied on the circuit. These results indicate that memristor coupling can be effective to control chaotic circuits and it is also useful to reproduce dynamical behaviors for neuronal activities."
https://openalex.org/W2783157140,"Millennium Development Goal 5 has not been universally achieved, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding whether maternal deaths occur during pregnancy, childbirth, or puerperium is important to effectively plan maternal health programs and allocate resources. Our main research objectives are to (1) describe the proportions and rates of mortality for the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods; (2) document how these trends vary by sub-region; and (3) investigate ecological correlations between these rates and maternal care interventions. We used data from the Demographic and Health Survey program, which comprises 84 surveys from 34 sub-Saharan African countries conducted between 1990 and 2014. We calculated age-standardized maternal mortality rates and time-specific maternal mortality rates and proportions, and we assessed correlations with maternal care coverage. We found high levels of maternal mortality in all three periods. Time-specific maternal mortality rates varied by country and region, with some showing an orderly decline in all three periods and others exhibiting alarming increases in antepartum and postpartum mortality. Ecological analysis showed that antenatal care coverage was significantly associated with low antepartum mortality, whereas the presence of a skilled attendant at childbirth was significantly associated with low postpartum mortality. In sub-Saharan Africa, maternal deaths occur at high rates in all three risk periods, and vary substantially by country and region. The provision of maternal care is a predictor of time-specific maternal mortality. These results confirm the need for country-specific interventions during the continuum of care to achieve the global commitment to eliminating preventable maternal mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2784164631,"The microbial community present in the gastrointestinal tract is an important component of the host defense against pathogen infections. We previously demonstrated that indole, a microbial metabolite of tryptophan, reduces enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 attachment to intestinal epithelial cells and biofilm formation, suggesting that indole may be an effector/attenuator of colonization for a number of enteric pathogens. Here, we report that indole attenuates Salmonella Typhimurium (Salmonella) virulence and invasion as well as increases resistance to colonization in host cells. Indole-exposed Salmonella colonized mice less effectively compared to solvent-treated controls, as evident by competitive index values less than 1 in multiple organs. Indole-exposed Salmonella demonstrated 160-fold less invasion of HeLa epithelial cells and 2-fold less invasion of J774A.1 macrophages compared to solvent-treated controls. However, indole did not affect Salmonella intracellular survival in J774A.1 macrophages suggesting that indole primarily affects Salmonella invasion. The decrease in invasion was corroborated by a decrease in expression of multiple Salmonella Pathogenicity Island-1 (SPI-1) genes. We also identified that the effect of indole was mediated by both PhoPQ-dependent and independent mechanisms. Indole also synergistically enhanced the inhibitory effect of a short chain fatty acid cocktail on SPI-1 gene expression. Lastly, indole-treated HeLa cells were 70% more resistant to Salmonella invasion suggesting that indole also increases resistance of epithelial cells to colonization. Our results demonstrate that indole is an important microbiota metabolite that has direct anti-infective effects on Salmonella and host cells, revealing novel mechanisms of pathogen colonization resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2784002879,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that commonly affects patients with AIDS and which is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The KSHV capsid is highly pressurized by its double-stranded DNA genome, as are the capsids of the eight other human herpesviruses. Capsid assembly and genome packaging of herpesviruses are prone to interruption and can therefore be targeted for the structure-guided development of antiviral agents. However, herpesvirus capsids-comprising nearly 3,000 proteins and over 1,300 Å in diameter-present a formidable challenge to atomic structure determination and functional mapping of molecular interactions. Here we report a 4.2 Å resolution structure of the KSHV capsid, determined by electron-counting cryo-electron microscopy, and its atomic model, which contains 46 unique conformers of the major capsid protein (MCP), the smallest capsid protein (SCP) and the triplex proteins Tri1 and Tri2. Our structure and mutagenesis results reveal a groove in the upper domain of the MCP that contains hydrophobic residues that interact with the SCP, which in turn crosslinks with neighbouring MCPs in the same hexon to stabilize the capsid. Multiple levels of MCP-MCP interaction-including six sets of stacked hairpins lining the hexon channel, disulfide bonds across channel and buttress domains in neighbouring MCPs, and an interaction network forged by the N-lasso domain and secured by the dimerization domain-define a robust capsid that is resistant to the pressure exerted by the enclosed genome. The triplexes, each composed of two Tri2 molecules and a Tri1 molecule, anchor to the capsid floor via a Tri1 N-anchor to plug holes in the MCP network and rivet the capsid floor. These essential roles of the MCP N-lasso and Tri1 N-anchor are verified by serial-truncation mutageneses. Our proof-of-concept demonstration of the use of polypeptides that mimic the smallest capsid protein to inhibit KSHV lytic replication highlights the potential for exploiting the interaction hotspots revealed in our atomic structure to develop antiviral agents."
https://openalex.org/W2786860261,"Classical or M1 activity of microglia/macrophages has been described in several neurodegenerative and brain inflammatory conditions and has also been linked to expansion of ischemic injury in post-stroke brain. While different pathways of M1 polarization have been suggested to occur in the post-stroke brain, the precise underlying mechanisms remain undefined. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model, we showed a progressive M2 to M1 polarization in the perilesional brain region with M1 cells becoming one of the dominant subsets by day 4 post-stroke. Comparing key receptors involved in M1 polarization (CD8, IFNγR, Clec4, FcγR, TLR3 and TLR4) and their signal transducers (Syk, Stat1, Irf3, and Traf6) at the day 4 time point, we showed a strong upregulation of CD8 along with SYK transducer in dissected perilesional brain tissue. We further showed that CD8 expression in the post-stroke brain was associated with activated (CD68+) macrophages and that progressive accumulation of CD8+CD68+ cells in the post-stroke brain coincided with increased iNOS (M1 marker) and reduced Arg1 (M2 marker) expression on these cells. In vitro ligand-based stimulation of the CD8 receptor caused increased iNOS expression and an enhanced capacity to phagocytose E. coli particles; and interestingly, CD8 stimulation was also able to repolarize IL4-treated M2 cells to an M1 phenotype. Our data suggest that increased CD8 signaling in the post-stroke brain is primarily associated with microglia/macrophages and can independently drive M1 polarization, and that modulation of CD8 signaling could be a potential target to limit secondary post-stroke brain damage."
https://openalex.org/W2783365047,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is characterized by a strong male predominance. Sex steroid hormones have been hypothesized to underlie this sex disparity, but no population-based study to date has examined this potential association.Using mass spectrometry and ELISA, we quantitated sex steroid hormones and sex hormone binding globulin, respectively, in plasma from males- 172 EA cases and 185 controls-within the Factors Influencing the Barrett/Adenocarcinoma Relationship (FINBAR) Study, a case-control investigation conducted in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Multivariable adjusted logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between circulating hormones and EA.Higher androgen:estrogen ratio metrics were associated with increased odds of EA (e.g., testosterone:estradiol ratio ORQ4 v. Q1 = 2.58, 95%CI = 1.23-5.43; Ptrend = 0.009). All estrogens and androgens were associated with significant decreased odds of EA. When restricted to individuals with minimal to no decrease in body mass index, the size of association for the androgen:estrogen ratio was not greatly altered.This first study of sex steroid hormones and EA provides tentative evidence that androgen:estrogen balance may be a factor related to EA. Replication of these findings in prospective studies is needed to enhance confidence in the causality of this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2786259523,"Inflammatory bone diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis and peri-implantitis, are associated not only with the production of inflammatory cytokines but also with local oxidative status, which is defined by intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Osteoclast differentiation has been reported to be related to increased intracellular ROS levels in osteoclast lineage cells. Sudachitin, which is a polymethoxyflavone derived from Citrus sudachi, possesses antioxidant properties and regulates various functions in mammalian cells. However, the effects of sudachitin on inflammatory bone destruction and osteoclastogenesis remain unknown. In calvaria inflamed by a local lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, inflammation-induced bone destruction and the accompanying elevated expression of osteoclastogenesis-related genes were reduced by the co-administration of sudachitin and LPS. Moreover, sudachitin inhibited osteoclast formation in cultures of isolated osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors. However, sudachitin rather increased the expression of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), which is an important molecule triggering osteoclast differentiation, and the mRNA ratio of RANKL/osteoprotegerin that is a decoy receptor for RANKL, in the isolated osteoblasts, suggesting the presence of additional target cells. When osteoclast formation was induced from osteoclast precursors derived from bone marrow cells in the presence of soluble RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, sudachitin inhibited osteoclastogenesis without influencing cell viability. Consistently, the expression of osteoclast differentiation-related molecules including c-fos, NFATc1, cathepsin K and osteoclast fusion proteins such as DC-STAMP and Atp6v0d2 was reduced by sudachitin. In addition, sudachitin decreased activation of MAPKs such as Erk and JNK and the ROS production evoked by RANKL in osteoclast lineage cells. Our findings suggest that sudachitin is a useful agent for the treatment of anti-inflammatory bone destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2782795861,"The maturation of RAS GTPases and approximately 200 other cellular CAAX proteins involves three enzymatic steps: addition of a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl prenyl lipid to the cysteine (C) in the C-terminal CAAX motif, proteolytic cleavage of the AAX residues and methylation of the exposed prenylcysteine residue at its terminal carboxylate. This final step is catalysed by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT), a eukaryote-specific integral membrane enzyme that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. ICMT is the only cellular enzyme that is known to methylate prenylcysteine substrates; methylation is important for the biological functions of these substrates, such as the membrane localization and subsequent activity of RAS, prelamin A and RAB. Inhibition of ICMT has potential for combating progeria and cancer. Here we present an X-ray structure of ICMT, in complex with its cofactor, an ordered lipid molecule and a monobody inhibitor, at 2.3 Å resolution. The active site spans cytosolic and membrane-exposed regions, indicating distinct entry routes for the cytosolic methyl donor, S-adenosyl-l-methionine, and for prenylcysteine substrates, which are associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The structure suggests how ICMT overcomes the topographical challenge and unfavourable energetics of bringing two reactants that have different cellular localizations together in a membrane environment-a relatively uncharacterized but defining feature of many integral membrane enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2789357758,"Background & aims The modest consumption of alcohol has been reported to decrease the incidence of fatty liver or prevalence of steatohepatitis. In this study, we investigated the effect of light alcohol consumption on liver function and gene expression in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods The study group was formed of 178 patients diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, subclassified into two groups for analysis based on the daily alcohol consumption: non-alcohol group and light alcohol consumer group (≤20 g of ethanol/day). Clinical characteristics, liver histological features, gene expression, comprehensively analyzed using microarrays (BRB-Array tools), and molecular network were evaluated and compared between the two groups. Results No significant differences in steatosis or inflammation score were noted among the groups. However, the ballooning and fibrosis scores were significantly lower in the light alcohol consumer group than in the non-alcohol group. Gene expression analysis revealed a marked inhibition of the pathways involved in the immune response in the light alcohol group compared to that in the non-alcohol group. Conclusions Light alcohol consumption might suppress activity of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by reducing gene expression levels involved in the immune response. This inhibition in gene expression was associated with a lowering of liver fibrosis and hepatocellular injury."
https://openalex.org/W2785971087,"Wheat is the staple food for most of the world's population; however, it is a poor source of zinc. Foliar fertilization of zinc via zinc loaded chitosan nanocarriers (Zn-CNP) post-anthesis has proved to be a promising approach for grain zinc enhancement in durum wheat as evidenced in our earlier study. However, the molecular mechanism of uptake of zinc via Zn-CNP remains unclear.Foliar application of Zn-CNP was performed at post anthesis stages in two durum wheat cultivars (MACS 3125 and UC1114, containing the Gpc-B1 gene), and expression levels of several metal-related genes were analyzed during early senescence. Zn-CNP application indeed caused changes in gene expression as revealed by qPCR data on representative genes involved in metal homeostasis, phloem transporters, and leaf senescence. Furthermore, zinc-regulated transporters and iron (Fe)-regulated transporter-like protein (ZIP) family [ZIP1, ZIP7, ZIP15], CA (carbonic anhydrase), and DMAS (2'-deoxymugineic acid synthase) in flag leaves exhibited significant correlation with zinc content in the seeds. The analysis of grain endosperm proteins showed enhancement of gamma gliadins while other gluten subunits decreased. Gene expression within ZIP family members varied with the type of cultivar mostly attributed to the Gpc-B1, concentration of external zinc ions as well as the type of tissue analyzed. Correlation analysis revealed the involvement of the selected genes in zinc enhancement.At the molecular level, uptake of zinc via Zn-CNP nanocarrier was comparable to the uptake of zinc via common zinc fertilizers i.e. ZnSO4."
https://openalex.org/W2789465771,"Sertoli cells (Sc) are unique somatic cells of testis that are the target of both FSH and testosterone (T) and regulate spermatogenesis. Although Sc of neonatal rat testes are exposed to high levels of FSH and T, robust differentiation of spermatogonial cells becomes conspicuous only after 11-days of postnatal age. We have demonstrated earlier that a developmental switch in terms of hormonal responsiveness occurs in rat Sc at around 12 days of postnatal age during the rapid transition of spermatogonia A to B. Therefore, such “functional maturation” of Sc, during pubertal development becomes prerequisite for the onset of spermatogenesis. However, a conspicuous difference in robust hormone (both T and FSH) induced gene expression during the different phases of Sc maturation restricts our understanding about molecular events necessary for the spermatogenic onset and maintenance. Here, using microarray technology, we for the first time have compared the differential transcriptional profile of Sc isolated and cultured from immature (5 days old), maturing (12 days old) and mature (60 days old) rat testes. Our data revealed that immature Sc express genes involved in cellular growth, metabolism, chemokines, cell division, MAPK and Wnt pathways, while mature Sc are more specialized expressing genes involved in glucose metabolism, phagocytosis, insulin signaling and cytoskeleton structuring. Taken together, this differential transcriptome data provide an important resource to reveal the molecular network of Sc maturation which is necessary to govern male germ cell differentiation, hence, will improve our current understanding of the etiology of some forms of idiopathic male infertility."
https://openalex.org/W2792958707,"The Stenocereus griseus species complex (SGSC) has long been considered taxonomically challenging because the number of taxa belonging to the complex and their geographical boundaries remain poorly understood. Bayesian clustering and genetic distance-based methods were used based on nine microsatellite loci in 377 individuals of three main putative species of the complex. The resulting genetic clusters were assessed for ecological niche divergence and areolar morphology, particularly spination patterns. We based our species boundaries on concordance between genetic, ecological, and morphological data, and were able to resolve four species, three of them corresponding to S. pruinosus from central Mexico, S. laevigatus from southern Mexico, and S. griseus from northern South America. A fourth species, previously considered to be S. griseus and commonly misidentified as S. pruinosus in northern Mexico showed significant genetic, ecological, and morphological differentiation suggesting that it should be considered a new species, S. huastecorum, which we describe here. We show that population genetic analyses, ecological niche modeling, and morphological studies are complementary approaches for delimiting species in taxonomically challenging plant groups such as the SGSC."
https://openalex.org/W2791368358,"The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is an agricultural and urban pest that has become widely established as an invasive species of major concern in the USA and across Europe. This species forms large aggregations when entering diapause, and it is often these aggregations that are found by officials conducting inspections of internationally shipped freight. Identifying the presence of diapausing aggregations of H. halys using their emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) may be a potential means for detecting and intercepting them during international freight inspections. Headspace samples were collected from aggregations of diapausing H. halys using volatile collection traps (VCTs) and solid phase microextraction. The only compound detected in all samples was tridecane, with small amounts of (E)-2-decenal found in most samples. We also monitored the release of defensive odors, following mechanical agitation of diapausing and diapause-disrupted adult H. halys. Diapausing groups were significantly more likely to release defensive odors than diapause-disrupted groups. The predominant compounds consistently found from both groups were tridecane, (E)-2-decenal, and 4-oxo-(E)-2-hexenal, with a small abundance of dodecane. Our findings show that diapausing H. halys do release defensive compounds, and suggest that volatile sampling may be feasible to detect H. halys in freight."

Participants were recruited using targeted sampling and interviewed using a structured questionnaire. We applied a four-step model building process using multivariable logistic regression to examine how sociodemographic, predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors were associated with retention in care. Overall, 78.5% of participants were linked to HIV care within 3 months after diagnosis or earlier, and 66.4% were adequately retained in care (at least one health care visit every three months once a person is diagnosed with HIV). Being on antiretroviral therapy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.00; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.93–12.3), using the Internet to find HIV-related information (AOR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.00–4.59), and having medical insurance (AOR = 2.84; 95% CI: 1.27–6.34) were associated with adequate retention in care. Involvement with an HIV-related organization was associated negatively with retention in care (AOR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.24–0.95). Future interventions should increase health insurance coverage and utilize the Internet to help MSM and waria to remain in HIV-related care, thereby assisting them in achieving viral suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2784947798,"Strong evidence supports the existence of Health Barriers to Learning (HBLs)—health conditions that when untreated or unmanaged can interfere with a child’s ability to learn and succeed in school. These HBLs include vision and hearing deficits, uncontrolled asthma, mental and behavioral problems, dental pain, persistent hunger, and the effects of lead exposure. However, 19% of US children aged 6 to 11 did not receive their annual checkup in the past year. School requirements for health screenings can help identify children with HBLs. This study explores which states require health screening for children in elementary school, and the extent to which the 7 HBLs are included. Methods Investigators reviewed websites of state departments of health and education, and legislation for all 50 states and DC. For states with mandated screenings and a required form, investigators applied structured analysis to assess HBL inclusion. Results No state mandated that schools require screening for all 7 HBLs. Less than half (49%) required comprehensive school health examinations and only 12 states plus DC required a specific form. Of these, 12 of the forms required documentation of vision screening, 11 of hearing screening, and 12 of dental screening. Ten forms asked about asthma and 9 required documentation of lead testing. Seven asked about general well-being, emotional problems, or mental health. None addressed hunger. When including states without comprehensive school health examination requirements, the most commonly required HBL screenings were for vision (80% of states; includes DC), hearing (75% of states; includes DC) and dental (24% of state; includes DC). Conclusion The lack of state mandated requirements for regular student health screening represents a missed opportunity to identify children with HBLs. Without state mandates, accompanying comprehensive forms, and protocols, children continue to be at risk of untreated health conditions that can undermine their success in school."
https://openalex.org/W2786360544,"Synchrotron radiation based nanoscopic X-ray fluorescence (SR nano-XRF) analysis can visualize trace level elemental distribution in a fully quantitative manner within single cells. However, in-air XRF analysis requires chemical fixation modifying the cell’s chemical composition. Here, we describe first nanoscopic XRF analysis upon cryogenically frozen (-150°C) fibroblasts at the ID16A-NI ‘Nano-imaging’ end-station located at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (France). Fibroblast cells were obtained from skin biopsies from control and Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) patients. FRDA is an autosomal recessive disorder with dysregulation of iron metabolism as a key feature. By means of the X-ray Fundamental Parameter (FP) method, including absorption correction of the ice layer deposited onto the fibroblasts, background-corrected mass fraction elemental maps of P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe and Zn of entire cryofrozen human fibroblasts were obtained. Despite the presence of diffracting microcrystals in the vitreous ice matrix and minor sample radiation damage effects, clusters of iron-rich hot-spots with similar mass fractions were found in the cytoplasm of both control and FRDA fibroblasts. Interestingly, no significant difference in the mean iron concentration was found in the cytoplasm of FRDA fibroblasts, but a significant decrease in zinc concentration. This finding might underscore metal dysregulation, beyond iron, in cells derived from FRDA patients. In conclusion, although currently having slightly increased limits of detection (LODs) compared to non-cryogenic mode, SR based nanoscopic XRF under cryogenic sample conditions largely obliterates the debate on chemical sample preservation and provides a unique tool for trace level elemental imaging in single cells close to their native state with a superior spatial resolution of 20 nm."
https://openalex.org/W2790248911,"Ionic liquids consisting of a combination of herbicidal anions with a quaternary ammonium cation act as efficient herbicides, which are under consideration to be used in the agriculture. In the present study, we used embryos of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model to assess the toxic potential of ammonium-based ionic liquids for aquatic organisms. As we assumed interference of the partially hydrophobic ionic liquid cation with lipids, we investigated the adaptation response in the lipid composition of the zebrafish embryos, triggered by the ionic compound. Therefore, the impact of ammonium-based ionic liquids with different lengths of the alkyl chain ([C6,C6,C1,C1N][Br], [C8,C8,C1,C1N][Br]) on the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profile of zebrafish embryos up to 72 hours post fertilization (hpf) was examined. Furthermore, the changes in the unsaturation index (UI) of PLFAs, as the sum parameter of membrane fluidity in eukaryotic cells, were presented. The PLFA’s UI in the zebrafish embryos upon exposure to quaternary ammonium salts was compared to the UI of the embryos upon exposure to nonionic 2,4-dichlorophenol, which has a similar hydrophobicity but is structurally different to [C8,C8,C1,C1N][Br]. It was shown that for ammonium-based ionic liquid precursors non-specific mode of action occurs and the toxic effect on lipid composition of zebrafish embryos can be well predicted based on chemical properties, like hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the changes in PLFAs, expressed by the UI, can be useful to study toxic effects of organic contamination. However, for zebrafish embryos, after ionic liquids and 2,4-DCP exposure, the changes were observed at high lethal concentrations, which caused the incidence of lethality of 30 and 50% of a group of test animals."
https://openalex.org/W2788416158,"Summer upwelling occurs frequently off the southeast Vietnam coast in the western South China Sea (SCS), where summer phytoplankton blooms generally appear during June-August. In this study, we investigate inter-annual variation of Ekman pumping and offshore transport, and its modulation on summer blooms southeast of Vietnam. The results indicate that there are low intensities of summer blooms in El Niño years, under higher sea surface temperatures (SST) and weaker winds. However, a different pattern of monthly chlorophyll a (Chl-a) blooms occurred in summer of 2007, a transitional stage from El Niño to La Niña, with weak (strong) wind and high (low) SST before (after) early July. There is a weak phytoplankton bloom before July 2007 and a strong phytoplankton bloom after July 2007. The abrupt change in the wind intensity may enhance the upwelling associated with Ekman pumping and offshore Ekman transport, bringing more high-nutrient water into the upper layer from the subsurface, and thus leading to an evident Chl-a bloom in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2786131418,"Bevacizumab combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy is the backbone of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) therapy; however, its treatment efficacy is hampered by therapeutic resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying bevacizumab resistance is crucial to increasing the therapeutic efficacy of bevacizumab. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (dataset, GSE86525) was used to identify the key genes and pathways involved in bevacizumab-resistant mCRC. The GEO2R web tool was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional and pathway enrichment analyses of the DEGs were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery(DAVID). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were established using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database(STRING) and visualized using Cytoscape software. A total of 124 DEGs were obtained, 57 of which upregulated and 67 were downregulated. PPI network analysis showed that seven upregulated genes and nine downregulated genes exhibited high PPI degrees. In the functional enrichment, the DEGs were mainly enriched in negative regulation of phosphate metabolic process and positive regulation of cell cycle process gene ontologies (GOs); the enriched pathways were the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-serine/threonine kinase signaling pathway, bladder cancer, and microRNAs in cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A(CDKN1A), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), CD19 molecule (CD19), breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1), platelet-derived growth factor subunit A (PDGFA), and matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) were the DEGs involved in the pathways and the PPIs. The clinical validation of the DEGs in mCRC (TNM clinical stages 3 and 4) revealed that high PDGFA expression levels were associated with poor overall survival, whereas high BRCA1 and MMP1 expression levels were associated with favorable progress free survival(PFS). The identified genes and pathways can be potential targets and predictors of therapeutic resistance and prognosis in bevacizumab-treated patients with mCRC."
https://openalex.org/W2792892833,"Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is tremendously useful for investigating many cellular and intracellular events. The monomeric GFP mNeonGreen is about 3- to 5-times brighter than GFP and monomeric enhanced GFP and shows high photostability. The maturation half-time of mNeonGreen is about 3-fold faster than that of monomeric enhanced GFP. However, the cDNA sequence encoding mNeonGreen contains some codons that are rarely used in Homo sapiens. For better expression of mNeonGreen in human cells, we synthesized a human-optimized cDNA encoding mNeonGreen and generated an expression plasmid for humanized mNeonGreen under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The resultant plasmid was introduced into HEK293 cells. The fluorescent intensity of humanized mNeonGreen was about 1.4-fold higher than that of the original mNeonGreen. The humanized mNeonGreen with a mitochondria-targeting signal showed mitochondrial distribution of mNeonGreen. We further generated an expression vector of humanized mNeonGreen with 3xFLAG tags at its carboxyl terminus as these tags are useful for immunological analyses. The 3xFLAG-tagged mNeonGreen was recognized well with an anti-FLAG-M2 antibody. These plasmids for the expression of humanized mNeonGreen and mNeonGreen-3xFLAG are useful tools for biological studies in mammalian cells using mNeonGreen."
https://openalex.org/W2794381734,"ABC multidrug transporters are key players in cancer multidrug resistance and in general xenobiotic elimination, thus their functional assays provide important tools for research and diagnostic applications. In this study we have examined the potential interactions of three key human ABC multidrug transporters with PhenGreen diacetate (PGD), a cell permeable fluorescent metal ion indicator. The non-fluorescent, hydrophobic PGD rapidly enters the cells and, after cleavage by cellular esterases, in the absence of quenching metal ions, PhenGreen (PG) becomes highly fluorescent. We found that in cells expressing functional ABCG2, ABCB1, or ABCC1 transporters, cellular PG fluorescence is strongly reduced. This fluorescence signal in the presence of specific transporter inhibitors is increased to the fluorescence levels in the control cells. Thus the PG accumulation assay is a new, unique tool for the parallel determination of the function of the ABCG2, ABCB1, and ABCC1 multidrug transporters. Since PG has very low cellular toxicity, the PG accumulation assay also allows the selection, separation and culturing of selected cell populations expressing either of these transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2964179721,"For a broad range of research and practical applications it is important to understand the allegiances, communities and structure of key players in society. One promising direction towards extracting this information is to exploit the rich relational data in digital social networks (the social graph). As global social networks (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) are very large, most approaches make use of distributed computing systems for this purpose. Distributing graph processing requires solving many difficult engineering problems, which has lead some researchers to look at single-machine solutions that are faster and easier to maintain. In this article, we present an approach for analyzing full social networks on a standard laptop, allowing for interactive exploration of the communities in the locality of a set of user specified query vertices. The key idea is that the aggregate actions of large numbers of users can be compressed into a data structure that encapsulates the edge weights between vertices in a derived graph. Local communities can be constructed by selecting vertices that are connected to the query vertices with high edge weights in the derived graph. This compression is robust to noise and allows for interactive queries of local communities in real-time, which we define to be less than the average human reaction time of 0.25s. We achieve single-machine real-time performance by compressing the neighborhood of each vertex using minhash signatures and facilitate rapid queries through Locality Sensitive Hashing. These techniques reduce query times from hours using industrial desktop machines operating on the full graph to milliseconds on standard laptops. Our method allows exploration of strongly associated regions (i.e., communities) of large graphs in real-time on a laptop. It has been deployed in software that is actively used by social network analysts and offers another channel for media owners to monetize their data, helping them to continue to provide free services that are valued by billions of people globally."
https://openalex.org/W2787262788,"The secondary cysts of the fish pathogen oomycete Saprolegnia parasitica possess bundles of long hooked hairs that are characteristic to this economically important pathogenic species. Few studies have been carried out on elucidating their specific role in the S. parasitica life cycle and the role they may have in the infection process. We show here their function by employing several strategies that focus on descriptive, developmental and predictive approaches. The strength of attachment of the secondary cysts of this pathogen was compared to other closely related species where bundles of long hooked hairs are absent. We found that the attachment of the S. parasitica cysts was around three times stronger than that of other species. The time sequence and influence of selected factors on morphology and the number of the bundles of long hooked hairs conducted by scanning electron microscopy study revealed that these are dynamic structures. They are deployed early after encystment, i.e., within 30 sec of zoospore encystment, and the length, but not the number, of the bundles steadily increased over the encystment period. We also observed that the number and length of the bundles was influenced by the type of substrate and encystment treatment applied, suggesting that these structures can adapt to different substrates (glass or fish scales) and can be modulated by different signals (i.e., protein media, 50 mM CaCl2 concentrations, carbon particles). Immunolocalization studies evidenced the presence of an adhesive extracellular matrix. The bioinformatic analyses of the S. parasitica secreted proteins showed that there is a high expression of genes encoding domains of putative proteins related to the attachment process and cell adhesion (fibronectin and thrombospondin) coinciding with the deployment stage of the bundles of long hooked hairs formation. This suggests that the bundles are structures that might contribute to the adhesion of the cysts to the host because they are composed of these adhesive proteins and/or by increasing the surface of attachment of this extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2793098970,"Artemisinin resistance is a major threat to malaria control efforts. Resistance is characterized by an increase in the Plasmodium falciparum parasite clearance half-life following treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and an increase in the percentage of surviving parasites. The remarkably short blood half-life of artemisinin derivatives may contribute to drug-resistance, possibly through factors including sub-lethal plasma concentrations and inadequate exposure. Here we selected for a new strain of artemisinin resistant parasites, termed the artemisinin resistant strain 1 (ARS1), by treating P. falciparum Palo Alto (PA) cultures with sub-lethal concentrations of dihydroartemisinin (DHA). The resistance phenotype was maintained for over 1 year through monthly maintenance treatments with low doses of 2.5 nM DHA. There was a moderate increase in the DHA IC50 in ARS1 when compared with parental strain PA after 72 h of drug exposure (from 0.68 nM to 2 nM DHA). In addition, ARS1 survived treatment physiologically relevant DHA concentrations (700 nM) observed in patients. Furthermore, we confirmed a lack of cross-resistance against a panel of antimalarials commonly used as partner drugs in ACTs. Finally, ARS1 did not contain Pfk13 propeller domain mutations associated with ART resistance in the Greater Mekong Region. With a stable growth rate, ARS1 represents a valuable tool for the development of new antimalarial compounds and studies to further elucidate the mechanisms of ART resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4246440476,"Interleukin (IL)-18 is involved in regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. Mice lacking whole-body IL-18 signalling are prone to develop weight gain and insulin resistance, a phenotype which is associated with impaired fat oxidation and ectopic skeletal muscle lipid deposition. IL-18 mRNA is expressed in human skeletal muscle but a role for IL-18 in muscle has not been identified. Patients with HIV-infection and lipodystrophy (LD) are characterized by lipid and glucose disturbances and increased levels of circulating IL-18. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle IL-18 and IL-18 receptor (R) expression would be altered in patients with HIV-lipodystrophy.Twenty-three HIV-infected patients with LD and 15 age-matched healthy controls were included in a cross-sectional study. Biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained and IL-18 and IL-18R mRNA expression were measured by real-time PCR and sphingolipids (ceramides, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-Phosphate, sphinganine) were measured by HPLC. Insulin resistance was assessed by HOMA and the insulin response during an OGTT.Patients with HIV-LD had a 60% and 54% lower level of muscular IL-18 and IL-18R mRNA expression, respectively, compared to age-matched healthy controls. Patients with HIV-LD had a trend towards increased levels of ceramide (18.3±4.7 versus 14.8±3.0,p = 0.06) and sphingosine (0.41±0.13 versus 0.32±0.07, and lower level of sphinganine (p = 0.06). Low levels of muscle IL-18 mRNA correlated to high levels of ceramides (r = -0.31, p = 0.038) and sphingosine-1P (r = -0.29, p = 0.046) in skeletal muscle, whereas such a correlation was not found in healthy controls. Low expression of IL-18 mRNA in skeletal muscle correlated to elevated concentration of circulating triglycerides (Rp = -0.73, p<0.0001). Neither muscle expression of IL-18 mRNA or ceramide correlated to parameters of insulin resistance.IL-18 (mRNA) in skeletal muscle appears to be involved in the regulation of intramuscular lipid metabolism and hypertriglyceridemia."
https://openalex.org/W2794435970,"Background Doxylamine-pyridoxine is recommended as a first line treatment for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy and it is commonly prescribed. We re-analysed the findings of a previously reported superiority trial of doxylamine-pyridoxine for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy using the clinical study report obtained from Health Canada. Methods and findings We re-analysed individual level data for a parallel arm randomized controlled trial that was conducted in six outpatient obstetrical practices in the United States. Pregnant women between 7 and 14 weeks of gestation with moderate nausea and vomiting of pregnancy symptoms. The active treatment was a tablet containing both doxylamine 10 mg and pyridoxine 10 mg taken between 2 and 4 times per day for 14 days depending on symptoms. The control was an identical placebo tablet taken using the same instructions. The primary outcome measure was improvement in nausea and vomiting of symptoms scores using the 13-point pregnancy unique quantification of emesis scale between baseline and 14 days using an ANCOVA. 140 participants were randomized into each group. Data for 131 active treatment participants and 125 control participants were analysed. On the final day of the trial, 101 active treatment participants and 86 control participants provided primary outcome measures. There was greater improvement in symptoms scores with doxylamine-pyridoxine compared with placebo (0.73 points; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.25) when last observation carried forward imputation was used for missing data but the difference is not statistically significant using other approaches to missing data (e.g. 0.38; 95% CI -0.08 to 0.84 using complete data). Conclusions There is a trend towards efficacy for nausea and vomiting symptoms with doxylamine-pyridoxine compared with placebo but the statistical significance of the difference depends on the method of handling missing data and the magnitude of the difference suggests that there is no clinically important benefit employing the prespecified minimal clinically important difference or “expected difference” of 3 points.

https://openalex.org/W2790073272,"The Burmese python, Python bivittatus Kuhl, is a well-established invasive species in the greater Everglades ecosystem of southern Florida, USA. Most research on its ecological impacts focuses on its role as a predator and its trophic interactions with native vertebrate species, particularly mammals. Beyond predation, there is little known about the ecological interactions between P. bivittatus and native faunal communities. It is likely that established populations of P. bivittatus in southern Florida serve as hosts for native mosquito communities. To test this concept, we used mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I DNA barcoding to determine the hosts of blood fed mosquitoes collected at a research facility in northern Florida where captive P. bivittatus and Argentine black and white tegu, Salvator merianae (Duméril and Bibron), are maintained in outdoor enclosures, accessible to local mosquitoes. We recovered python DNA from the blood meals of three species of Culex mosquitoes: Culex erraticus (Dyar and Knab), Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and Culex pilosus (Dyar and Knab). Culex erraticus conclusively (P = 0.001; Fisher’s Exact Test) took more blood meals from P. bivittatus than from any other available host. While the majority of mosquito blood meals in our sample were derived from P. bivittatus, only one was derived from S. merianae. These results demonstrate that local mosquitoes will feed on invasive P. bivittatus, a recently introduced host. If these interactions also occur in southern Florida, P. bivittatus may be involved in the transmission networks of mosquito-vectored pathogens. Our results also illustrate the potential of detecting the presence of P. bivittatus in the field through screening mosquito blood meals for their DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2789638173,"Juvenile fish nurseries are an essential life stage requirement for the maintenance of many fish populations. With many inshore habitats globally in decline, optimising habitat management by increasing our understanding of the relationship between juvenile fish and nursery habitats may be a prudent approach. Previous research on post-settlement snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) has suggested that structure may provide a water flow refuge, allowing snapper to access high water flow sites that will also have a high flux of their pelagic prey. We investigated this hypothesis by describing how Artificial Seagrass Units (ASUs) modified water flow while also using a multi-camera set up to quantify snapper position in relation to this water flow environment. Horizontal water flow was reduced on the down-current side of ASUs, but only at the height of the seagrass canopy. While the highest abundance of snapper did occur down-current of the ASUs, many snapper also occupied other locations or were too high in the water column to receive any refuge from water flow. The proportion of snapper within the water column was potentially driven by strategy to access zooplankton prey, being higher on the up-current side of ASUs and on flood tides. It is possible that post-settlement snapper alternate position to provide opportunities for both feeding and flow refuging. An alternative explanation relates to an observed interaction between post-settlement snapper and a predator, which demonstrated that snapper can utilise habitat structure when threatened. The nature of this relationship, and its overall importance in determining the value of nursery habitats to post-settlement snapper remains an elusive next step."
https://openalex.org/W2790510662,"In this study chemotherapy response in neuroblastoma (NB) was assessed for the first time in a transplantation model comprising non-malignant human embryonic microenvironment of pluripotent stem cell teratoma (PSCT) derived from diploid bona fide hESC. Two NB cell lines with known high-risk phenotypes; the multi-resistant BE(2)-C and the drug sensitive IMR-32, were transplanted to the PSCT model and the tumour growth was exposed to single or repeated treatments with doxorubicin, and thereafter evaluated for cell death, apoptosis, and proliferation. Dose dependent cytotoxic effects were observed, this way corroborating the experimental platform for this type of analysis. Notably, analysis of doxorubicin-resilient BE(2)-C growth in the PSCT model revealed an unexpected 1,5-fold increase in Ki67-index (p<0.05), indicating that non-cycling (G0) cells entered the cell cycle following the doxorubicin exposure. Support for this notion was obtained also in vitro. A pharmacologically relevant dose (1μM) resulted in a marked accumulation of Ki67 positive BE(2)-C cells (p<0.0001), as well as a >3-fold increase in active cell cycle (i.e. cells positive staining for PH3 together with incorporation of EdU) (p<0.01). Considering the clinical challenge for treating high-risk NB, the discovery of a therapy-provoked growth-stimulating effect in the multi-resistant and p53-mutated BE(2)-C cell line, but not in the drug-sensitive p53wt IMR-32 cell line, warrants further studies concerning generality and clinical significance of this new observation."

Methods Based on national school health examination data from 2009 to 2014, 25,142 obese or overweight students were examined for aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels, and health behaviors. Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio for liver enzyme elevation. Results Subjects who thought of themselves as “very fat” had a 1.6 times higher odds ratio for liver enzyme elevations than those who thought of themselves as “normal.” Those who consumed fast food 3 to 5 times weekly had 1.3 times higher odds ratio (OR = 1.27, 95% confidence interval = 1.05–1.54) for the elevation of ALT than those who did not consume fast food. Those who took sugar-sweetened beverage 3 to 5 times weekly had 1.2 times higher odds ratio (OR = 1.24, 95% confidence interval = 1.07–1.42) for the elevation of ALT than those who did not take it. Those who played computer game more than 2 hours a day showed 1.1 times higher odds ratio (OR = 1.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.01–1.21) for the elevation of ALT than those who did not. Conclusions Specific food item and its frequency of consumption were identified for the positive and negative association with the elevation of liver enzymes. Self-image of body shape, sleeping time and need of help for alcohol or smoking problems also showed substantial association with the elevation."

No metal ion diffusion was observed, indicating the safety of our solution processed implant materials."
https://openalex.org/W2789053322,"Sperm competence in animal fertilization requires the collective activities of numerous sperm-specific proteins that are typically alloimmunogenic in females. Consequently, sperm membrane alloantigens are potential targets for contraceptives that act by blocking the proteins’ functions in gamete interactions. Here we used a targeted proteomics approach to identify the major alloantigens in swine sperm membranes and lipid rafts, and thereby systematically defined the repertoire of these sperm-specific proteins in a single species. Gilts with high alloantibody reactivity to proteins in sperm membranes or lipid rafts produced fewer offspring (73% decrease) than adjuvant-only or nonimmune control animals. Alloantisera recognized more than 20 potentially unique sperm membrane proteins and five sperm lipid raft proteins resolved on two-dimensional immunoblots with or without prior enrichment by anion exchange chromatography. Dominant sperm membrane alloantigens identified by mass spectrometry included the ADAMs fertilin α, fertilin ß, and cyritestin. Less abundant alloantigens included ATP synthase F1 β subunit, myo-inositol monophosphatase-1, and zymogen granule membrane glycoprotein-2. Immunodominant sperm lipid raft alloantigens included SAMP14, lymphocyte antigen 6K, and the epididymal sperm protein E12. Of the fifteen unique membrane alloantigens identified, eleven were known sperm-specific proteins with uncertain functions in fertilization, and four were not previously suspected to exist as sperm-specific isoforms. De novo sequences of tryptic peptides from sperm membrane alloantigen “M6” displayed no evident homology to known proteins, so is a newly discovered sperm-specific gene product in swine. We conclude that alloimmunizing gilts with sperm membranes or lipid rafts evokes formation of antibodies to a relatively small number of dominant alloantigens that include known and novel sperm-specific proteins with possible functions in fertilization and potential utility as targets for immunocontraception."

We undertook a large-scale, mixed cohort, comparative study to assess the correlation of optic disc measurements between different imaging modalities and investigated the impact of patient and disc associated parameters.ONH sizes were obtained from one randomly selected eye of each of 209 patients using stereophotography, confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and two different optical coherence tomographers (OCT). Patient related data, glaucoma status and optic disc variables, specifically oblique insertion, torsion, presence of beta PPA and spherical equivalent were recorded. Measurements between imaging modalities were analysed using Pearson correlation, linear regression analysis and Blend-Altman plots. Individual variables were compared applying multivariate regression analysis, ANOVA and chi square statistics was used to determine correlations between patient and clinical characteristics.Absolute measurements significantly differed between imaging modalities generally producing smaller measurements for OCT derived measurements of Bruch's membrane opening (BMO). Pairwise correlations between imaging modalities were between 0.83 and 0.93 for discs without myopia, oblique insertion, or beta PPA. These features impacted on measurements for individual modalities and consequently contributed to inconsistencies and variability.In comparison to planimetry, OCT derived BMO measurements are more variable in the presence of oblique insertion, beta PPA or magnification errors due to myopia. Impact of these factors, however, differs between instruments and needs to be considered to accurately interpret optic disc features in particular within the context of glaucoma diagnosis."

Double stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been suggested as a biopesticide for M. domestica but a phenotypic response due to the induction of the RNAi pathway has not been demonstrated in adults. In this study female house flies were injected with dsRNA targeting actin-5C or ribosomal protein (RP) transcripts RPL26 and RPS6. Ovaries showed highly reduced provisioning and clutch reductions of 94–99% in RP dsRNA treated flies but not in actin-5C or GFP treated flies. Gene expression levels were significantly and specifically reduced in dsRNA injected groups but remained unchanged in the control dsGFP treated group. Furthermore, injections with an Aedes aegypti conspecific dsRNA designed against RPS6 did not impact fecundity, demonstrating species specificity of the RNAi response. Analysis of M. domestica tissues following RPS6 dsRNA injection showed significant reduction of transcript levels in the head, thorax, and abdomen but increased expression in ovarian tissues. This study demonstrates that exogenous dsRNA is specifically effective and has potential efficacy as a highly specific biocontrol intervention in adult house flies. Further work is required to develop effective methods for delivery of dsRNA to adult flies."

Strain Xen35, a bioluminescent derivative of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 4 strain TIGR4 was previously constructed for use for in vivo imaging of infections in animal models. We have shown that strain Xen35 is less virulent than its parent TIGR4 and that this is associated with the expression of the genes for bioluminescence. The expression of the luxA-E genes in the pneumococcus reduces virulence and down regulates the expression of the pneumococcal pilus."
https://openalex.org/W2789278378,"Chronic inhalation of crystalline silica and silicates may lead to severe lung disease in humans, termed silicosis. The disease is an occupational health concern in miners and related professions worldwide. Silicosis is also a strong risk factor for tuberculosis in humans. Due to its subterranean lifestyle, the European badger (Meles meles) is continuously exposed to environmental dust, while this species is also susceptible to tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis. To date, a thorough investigation of mineral dust retention and its possible implication as a risk factor for mycobacterial infection in badgers has not been performed. The aims of this retrospective histological study were (1) to describe the systemic tissue distribution of silica-laden macrophages (SLMs) in badgers; (2) to compare the amount of SLMs in tissues of badgers of differing M. bovis infection status, pulmonary SLM burden and age; and (3) to assess whether inflammation was associated with SLMs. We assessed lung, lymph nodes, liver and spleen of 60 wild-caught badgers of known M. bovis infection status for the presence of SLMs using polarizing light microscopy. SLMs were consistently present within the lungs and were widely distributed throughout the lymphatic system. No inflammatory reaction to SLMs, as occurs in human silicosis, was observed in any tissue. Distribution and amount of SLMs were similar between M. bovis positive and negative badgers, and we were not able to show an association between the amount of SLMs and M. bovis infection status. The amount of SLMs within intra- and extrathoracic lymph nodes was positively associated with the amount of pulmonary SLMs, and with age. This is the first report of substantial and systemic tissue retention of mineral dust particles in a mammalian species lacking associated chronic inflammation (i.e. silicosis). We further highlight different pathogenetic mechanisms underlying silicosis and benign SLM accumulations following siliceous dust inhalation."
https://openalex.org/W2963272871,"Language, which allows complex ideas to be communicated through symbolic sequences, is a characteristic feature of our species and manifested in a multitude of forms. Using large written corpora for many different languages and scripts, we show that the occurrence probability distributions of signs at the left and right ends of words have a distinct heterogeneous nature. Characterizing this asymmetry using quantitative inequality measures, viz. information entropy and the Gini index, we show that the beginning of a word is less restrictive in sign usage than the end. This property is not simply attributable to the use of common affixes as it is seen even when only word roots are considered. We use the existence of this asymmetry to infer the direction of writing in undeciphered inscriptions that agrees with the archaeological evidence. Unlike traditional investigations of phonotactic constraints which focus on language-specific patterns, our study reveals a property valid across languages and writing systems. As both language and writing are unique aspects of our species, this universal signature may reflect an innate feature of the human cognitive phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2788217217,"Proteins with great sequence similarity usually have similar structure, function and other physicochemical properties. But in many cases, one or more of the physicochemical or functional characteristics differ, sometimes very considerably, among these homologous proteins. To better understand how critical amino acids determine quantitative properties of function in proteins, the responsible residues must be located and identified. This can be difficult to achieve, particularly in cases where multiple amino acids are involved. In this work, two triosephosphate isomerases with very high similarity from two related human parasites were used to address one such problem. We demonstrate that a seventy-fold difference in the reactivity of an interface cysteine to the sulfhydryl reagent methylmethane sulfonate in these two enzymes depends on three amino acids located far away from this critical residue and which could not have been predicted using other current methods. Starting from previous observations with chimeric proteins involving these two triosephosphate isomerases, we developed a strategy involving additive mutant enzymes and selected site directed mutants to locate and identify the three amino acids. These three residues seem to induce changes in the interface cysteine in reactivity by increasing (or decreasing) its apparent pKa. Some enzymes with four to seven mutations also exhibited altered reactivity. This study completes a strategy for identifying key residues in the sequences of proteins that can have applications in future protein structure-function studies."
https://openalex.org/W2788435252,"After receiving bad publicity in 2012 and being removed from many ground beef products, finely textured beef (referred to as 'pink slime' by some) is making a comeback. Some of its proponents argue that consumers prefer ground beef containing finely textured beef, but no objective scientific party has tested this claim-that is the purpose of the present study. Over 200 untrained subjects participated in a sensory analysis in which they tasted one ground beef sample with no finely textured beef, another with 15% finely textured beef (by weight), and another with more than 15%. Beef with 15% finely textured beef has an improved juiciness (p < 0.01) and tenderness (p < 0.01) quality. However, subjects rate the flavor-liking and overall likeability the same regardless of the finely textured beef content. Moreover, when the three beef types are consumed as part of a slider (small hamburger), subjects are indifferent to the level of finely textured beef."
