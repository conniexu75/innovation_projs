https://openalex.org/W4223591189,"Abstract Characterization of the genetic landscape of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADD) provides a unique opportunity for a better understanding of the associated pathophysiological processes. We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study totaling 111,326 clinically diagnosed/‘proxy’ AD cases and 677,663 controls. We found 75 risk loci, of which 42 were new at the time of analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the involvement of amyloid/tau pathways and highlighted microglia implication. Gene prioritization in the new loci identified 31 genes that were suggestive of new genetically associated processes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha pathway through the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. We also built a new genetic risk score associated with the risk of future AD/dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD/dementia. The improvement in prediction led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in AD risk from the lowest to the highest decile, in addition to effects of age and the APOE ε4 allele."

To improve editing efficiency and overcome the strict TC sequence-context constraint of DddA, we used phage-assisted non-continuous and continuous evolution to evolve DddA variants with improved activity and expanded targeting scope. Compared to canonical DdCBEs, base editors with evolved DddA6 improved mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) editing efficiencies at TC by 3.3-fold on average. DdCBEs containing evolved DddA11 offered a broadened HC (H = A, C or T) sequence compatibility for both mitochondrial and nuclear base editing, increasing average editing efficiencies at AC and CC targets from less than 10% for canonical DdCBE to 15-30% and up to 50% in cell populations sorted to express both halves of DdCBE. We used these evolved DdCBEs to efficiently install disease-associated mtDNA mutations in human cells at non-TC target sites. DddA6 and DddA11 substantially increase the effectiveness and applicability of all-protein base editing."

https://openalex.org/W4223474154,"Hydrocephalus, characterized by cerebral ventricular dilatation, is routinely attributed to primary defects in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homeostasis. This fosters CSF shunting as the leading reason for brain surgery in children despite considerable disease heterogeneity. In this study, by integrating human brain transcriptomics with whole-exome sequencing of 483 patients with congenital hydrocephalus (CH), we found convergence of CH risk genes in embryonic neuroepithelial stem cells. Of all CH risk genes, TRIM71/lin-41 harbors the most de novo mutations and is most specifically expressed in neuroepithelial cells. Mice harboring neuroepithelial cell-specific Trim71 deletion or CH-specific Trim71 mutation exhibit prenatal hydrocephalus. CH mutations disrupt TRIM71 binding to its RNA targets, causing premature neuroepithelial cell differentiation and reduced neurogenesis. Cortical hypoplasia leads to a hypercompliant cortex and secondary ventricular enlargement without primary defects in CSF circulation. These data highlight the importance of precisely regulated neuroepithelial cell fate for normal brain-CSF biomechanics and support a clinically relevant neuroprogenitor-based paradigm of CH."

Sepofarsen is an RNA antisense oligonucleotide targeting the c.2991+1655A>G variant in the CEP290 gene to treat LCA10. In this open-label, phase 1b/2 ( NCT03140969 ), 12-month, multicenter, multiple-dose, dose-escalation trial, six adult patients and five pediatric patients received ≤4 doses of intravitreal sepofarsen into the worse-seeing eye. The primary objective was to evaluate sepofarsen safety and tolerability via the frequency and severity of ocular adverse events (AEs); secondary objectives were to evaluate pharmacokinetics and efficacy via changes in functional outcomes. Six patients received sepofarsen 160 µg/80 µg, and five patients received sepofarsen 320 µg/160 µg. Ten of 11 (90.9%) patients developed ocular AEs in the treated eye (5/6 with 160 µg/80 µg; 5/5 with 320 µg/160 µg) versus one of 11 (9.1%) in the untreated eye; most were mild in severity and dose dependent. Eight patients developed cataracts, of which six (75.0%) were categorized as serious (2/3 with 160 µg/80 µg; 4/5 with 320 µg/160 µg), as lens replacement was required. As the 160-µg/80-µg group showed a better benefit-risk profile, higher doses were discontinued or not initiated. Statistically significant improvements in visual acuity and retinal sensitivity were reported (post hoc analysis). The manageable safety profile and improvements reported in this trial support the continuation of sepofarsen development."
https://openalex.org/W4223421933,"Abstract The age at onset of motor symptoms in Huntington’s disease (HD) is driven by HTT CAG repeat length but modified by other genes. In this study, we used exome sequencing of 683 patients with HD with extremes of onset or phenotype relative to CAG length to identify rare variants associated with clinical effect. We discovered damaging coding variants in candidate modifier genes identified in previous genome-wide association studies associated with altered HD onset or severity. Variants in FAN1 clustered in its DNA-binding and nuclease domains and were associated predominantly with earlier-onset HD. Nuclease activities of purified variants in vitro correlated with residual age at motor onset of HD. Mutating endogenous FAN1 to a nuclease-inactive form in an induced pluripotent stem cell model of HD led to rates of CAG expansion similar to those observed with complete FAN1 knockout. Together, these data implicate FAN1 nuclease activity in slowing somatic repeat expansion and hence onset of HD."
https://openalex.org/W4225883667,"Cancer-associated gene fusions are a potential source for highly immunogenic neoantigens, but the lack of computational tools for accurate, sensitive identification of personal gene fusions has limited their targeting in personalized cancer immunotherapy. Here we present EasyFuse, a machine learning computational pipeline for detecting cancer-specific gene fusions in transcriptome data obtained from human cancer samples. EasyFuse predicts personal gene fusions with high precision and sensitivity, outperforming previously described tools. By testing immunogenicity with autologous blood lymphocytes from patients with cancer, we detected pre-established CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses for 10 of 21 (48%) and for 1 of 30 (3%) identified gene fusions, respectively. The high frequency of T cell responses detected in patients with cancer supports the relevance of individual gene fusions as neoantigens that might be targeted in personalized immunotherapies, especially for tumors with low mutation burden. EasyFuse detects gene fusions in cancer transcriptomes for personalized immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4225835056,"Host biomarkers are increasingly being considered as tools for improved COVID-19 detection and prognosis. We recently profiled circulating host-encoded microRNA (miRNAs) during SARS-CoV-2 infection, revealing a signature that classified COVID-19 cases with 99.9% accuracy. Here we sought to develop a signature suited for clinical application by analyzing specimens collected using minimally invasive procedures. Eight miRNAs displayed altered expression in anterior nasal tissues from COVID-19 patients, with miR-142-3p, a negative regulator of interleukin-6 (IL-6) production, the most strongly upregulated. Supervised machine learning analysis revealed that a three-miRNA signature (miR-30c-2-3p, miR-628-3p and miR-93-5p) independently classifies COVID-19 cases with 100% accuracy. This study further defines the host miRNA response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifies candidate biomarkers for improved COVID-19 detection."
https://openalex.org/W4226341470,"Dietary cholesterol has been implicated to promote lung cancer. Lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) is a main type of lung cancer, whereas the functional mechanism of cholesterol in LAC remained largely unknown. In the present study, we evidenced that cholesterol promoted cell proliferation and invasion of LAC in vitro as well as LAC metastasis in vivo. Cyp27A1 knockdown reduced the cholesterol-induced LAC cells proliferation and invasion. In contrast, Cyp7B1 knockdown enhanced the effect of cholesterol on LAC cells proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, Cyp27A1 deficiency remarkably reduced high cholesterol-induced LAC metastasis in vivo. Mechanism investigation demonstrated that exposure of LAC cells to 27-hydroxycholesterol induced the phosphorylation of AKT and NFκB p65, and promoted the expression of peptidylprolyl isomerase B (PPIB), especially in the coculture with THP1-derived macrophage. Meanwhile, 27-hydroxycholesterol induced the secretion of FGF2 and IL-6, which contributed to the expression of snail and vimentin. Luciferase report assay and ChIP assay confirmed that NFκB p65 controlled the transcription of PPIB. Inhibiting NFκB p65 activation reduced PPIB expression. PPIB inhibition reduced 27-hydroxycholesterol-induced expression of snail and vimentin. These results indicated that 27-hydroxycholesterol linked high cholesterol and LAC metastasis by regulating NFκB/PPIB axis and the secretion of FGF2 and IL-6."
https://openalex.org/W4226072866,"Mitigation measures for the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and burden on health systems created challenges for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) service delivery. We examined PrEP uptake in PEPFAR programs before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.We studied two PEPFAR program monitoring indicators, using routine Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting (MER) indicators capturing uptake of PrEP (PrEP_NEW) and overall use of PrEP (PrEP_CURR). We also analyzed descriptive program narratives to understand successes and challenges field teams encountered after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. To assess changes in coverage of PrEP across 21 countries, we calculated the ""PrEP to need ratio"" (PnR) using a published methodology. We defined the pre-COVID time period as April 1, 2019 -March 31, 2020 and the COVID time period as April 1, 2020 -March 31, 2021.The total number of persons who initiated PrEP increased by 157% from 233,250 in the pre-COVID-19 period compared with 599,935 in the COVID-19 period. All countries, except five, noted significant increases in PrEP uptake. PrEP uptake among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) increased by 159% from 80,452 AGYW in the pre-COVID-19 period to 208,607 AGYW in the COVID-19 period. There were 77,430 key populations (KP) initiated on PrEP in the pre-COVID-19 period and 209,114 KP initiated in the COVID-19 period (a 170% increase). The PnR increased 214% in the COVID-19 period across all PEPFAR-supported countries. Adaptations, such as multi-month dispensing (MMD) of PrEP; virtual demand creation activities; decentralized, community-based and virtual service delivery, were implemented to maintain PrEP services.PEPFAR programs continued to maintain and initiate new clients on PrEP despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adaptations such as MMD of PrEP and use of technology were vital in expanding service delivery and increasing PrEP coverage.This project has been supported by the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief."

https://openalex.org/W4226055594,"Background There was limited data on treatment outcomes among patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in Ethiopia. Objective The aim of the study was to determine the treatment outcomes of DKA patients attending Debre Tabor General Hospital. Method A retrospective study was conducted at Debre Tabor General Hospital and data were collected from June 1 to June 30 of 2018. Participants included in the study were all diabetic patients with DKA admitted from August 2010 to May 31, 2018. The primary outcomes were the treatment outcomes of DKA including (in-hospital glycemic control, the length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality). The statistical analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. Descriptive statistics was presented in the form of means with standard deviation and binary regression was conducted to determine factors that affect length of hospital stay among DKA patients. Result 387 patients were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 33.30± 14.96 years. The most common precipitating factor of DKA was new onset diabetes mellitus 150(38.8%). The mean length of hospital stay was 4.64(±2.802) days. The mean plasma glucose at admission and discharge was 443.63(±103.33) and 172.94 (±80.60) mg/dL, respectively. The majority 370 (95.60%) of patients improved and discharged whereas 17 (4.40%) patients died in the hospital. Patients with mild and moderate DKA showed short hospital stay; AOR: 0.16 [0.03–0.78] and AOR:0.17[0.03–0.96] compared with severe DKA. Diabetic ketoacidosis precipitated by infection were nearly five times more likely to have long hospital stay than DKA precipitated by other causes; AOR: 4.59 [1.08–19.42]. In addition, serum glucose fluctuation during hospitalization increased the likelihood of long hospital stay, AOR: 2.15[1.76–2.63]. Conclusions New onset type 1 diabetes was the major precipitating factor for DKA. Admitted DKA patients remained in hospital for a duration of approximately five days. About five out of hundred DKA patients ended up with death in the hospital. Infection, serum glucose fluctuations and severity of DKA were determinants of long hospital stay. Early prevention of precipitating factors and adequate management of DAK are warranted to reduce length of hospital stay and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4226241081,"Mapping population distribution at a fine spatial scale is essential for urban studies and planning. Numerous studies, mainly supported by geospatial and statistical methods, have focused primarily on predicting population counts. However, estimating their socio-economic characteristics beyond population counts, such as average age, income, and gender ratio, remains unattended. We enhance traditional population estimation by predicting not only the number of residents in an area, but also their demographic characteristics: average age and the proportion of seniors. By implementing and comparing different machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Linear Regression) in administrative areas in Singapore, we investigate the use of point of interest (POI) and real estate data for this purpose. The developed regression model predicts the average age of residents in a neighbourhood with a mean error of about 1.5 years (the range of average resident age across Singaporean districts spans approx. 14 years). The results reveal that age patterns of residents can be predicted using real estate information rather than with amenities, which is in contrast to estimating population counts. Another contribution of our work in population estimation is the use of previously unexploited POI and real estate datasets for it, such as property transactions, year of construction, and flat types (number of rooms). Advancing the domain of population estimation, this study reveals the prospects of a small set of detailed and strong predictors that might have the potential of estimating other demographic characteristics such as income."
https://openalex.org/W4225295008,"Protein–protein interactions drive various biological processes in healthy as well as disease states. The transcription factor c-Myc plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its deregulated expression is linked to various human cancers; therefore, it can be considered a viable target for cancer therapeutics. However, the structural heterogeneity of c-Myc due to its disordered nature poses a major challenge to drug discovery. In the present study, we used an in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis approach to identify “hot spot” residues within the c-Myc/Myc-associated factor X interface, which is highly disordered and has not yet been systematically analyzed for potential small molecule binding sites. We then used the information gained from this analysis to screen potential inhibitors using a conformation ensemble approach. The fluorescence-based biophysical experiments showed that the identified hit molecules displayed noncovalent interactions with these hot spot residues, and further cell-based experiments showed substantial in vitro potency against diverse c-Myc-expressing cancer/stem cells by deregulating c-Myc activity. These biophysical and computational studies demonstrated stable binding of the hit compounds with the disordered c-Myc protein. Collectively, our data indicated effective drug targeting of the disordered c-Myc protein via the determination of hot spot residues in the c-Myc/Myc-associated factor X heterodimer.

In normal cells, protein–protein interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in normal cellular functioning via regulating various biological processes; one of many is the formation of specific and dynamic interaction in the cell signaling pathway (1Jones S. Thornton J.M. Principles of protein-protein interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 2Nooren I.M.A. Thornton J.M.

On an estimate, around 130,000 to 650,000 PPIs are present in the complex human interactome and responsible for numerous biological functions in normal and diseased cells (4Klein M.A. Stabilized helical peptides: A strategy to target protein-protein interactions.ACS Med.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 6959-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The deregulated PPI is reported in various disease states, including cancer (6Fry D.C. Vassilev L.T. Targeting protein-protein interactions for cancer therapy.J. Mol. Med. 2005; 83: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Harris C.C. Protein-protein interactions for cancer therapy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1629-1660Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A perturbated PPI leads to altered behavior of a given metabolic pathway, making the PPI an attractive target for drug discovery. The knowledge of the PPI structural aspect indicates that the energy distribution is not uniform in a given PPI, and only a small subset of amino acids will have the majority of contribution in binding free energy than others (8Moreira I.S. Fernandes P.A. Ramos M.J. Hot spots - a review of the protein-protein interface determinant amino-acid residues.Proteins. 2007; 68: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 9Clackson T. Wells J.A. A hot spot of binding energy in a hormone-receptor interface.Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). These residues significantly contribute to binding free energy in PPIs are called “hot spots” (10Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. Anatomy of hot spots in protein interfaces.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). A more specific definition of a hot spot is an amino acid residue when mutated with alanine results in a decrease of at least 2.0 kcal/mol in the binding free energy (11Liu Q. Chen P. Wang B. Zhang J. Li J. Hot spot prediction in protein-protein interactions by an ensemble system.BMC Syst. Biol. 2018; 12: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 12Keskin O. Ma B. Nussinov R.

Biol. 2005; 345: 1281-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Detection of these hot spots in deregulated PPIs has helped researchers for structure-based drug discovery. c-Myc/Myc-associated factor X (MAX) is a classic example of PPI, which plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis by regulating various cellular processes, like cell cycle progression, cell growth and division, metabolism, cell adhesion, mobility, telomerase activity, and apoptosis (13Dang C.V.

MYC and transcription elongation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4a020990Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The heterodimer controls the expression of nearly 15% of the entire human genome via binding to the palindromic enhancer box sequences or E-box present at the promoter of the target genes (16Dang C.V. O’Donnell K.A. Zeller K.I. Nguyen T. Osthus R.C. Li F. The c-Myc target gene network.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2006; 16: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The expression level and activity of c-Myc is highly controlled in the normal cells, and its deregulation is associated with various solid and hematological tumors showing aggressive nature and chemoresistance (17Carabet L.

The involvement of c-Myc in various cancers makes it a promising therapeutic target for developing novel antineoplastic drugs. In the last 2 decades, researchers have employed various strategies to inhibit the functionality of c-Myc (19Coudé M.M. Braun T. Berrou J. Dupont M. Bertrand S. Masse A. Raffoux E. Itzykson R.

A. 2014; 111: 12556-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These strategies include the transcriptional and posttranslational targeting of c-Myc. Till now, various small molecules and peptide-based inhibitors have been reported, but they all fail in the clinical trials due to unappropriated pharmacokinetic behavior and lack of in vivo potency. Targeting c-Myc/MAX heterodimerization has always been preferred to discover potent inhibitor that exclusively inhibits the regulatory functionality of c-Myc. However, several challenges are associated with therapeutic intervention against c-Myc that restrict the development of c-Myc-targeted antineoplastic drugs. The Myc/MAX interacting interface is relatively large (∼3200 Å2), flat, and lacks appropriate and uncharacterized binding sites for small molecule binding (22Fletcher S. Prochownik E.V. Small-molecule inhibitors of the Myc oncoprotein.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1849: 525-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Li B. Simon M.C. Molecular pathways: Targeting MYC-induced metabolic reprogramming and oncogenic stress in cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2013; 19: 5835-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The c-Myc and MAX belong to the basic helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper (bHLH-LZ) protein family. The C-terminal region of c-Myc is a bHLH-LZ domain, which binds with the partner protein MAX to form the oncogenic heterodimer. In isolation, the bHLH-LZ domain of c-Myc is highly disordered (partially folded), which undergoes ordered transformation after dimerization with MAX via adopting a stable helical conformation (24Conacci-Sorrell M. McFerrin L. Eisenman R.N. An overview of MYC and its interactome.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4a014357Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Jin F. Yu C. Lai L. Liu Z. Ligand clouds around protein clouds: A scenario of ligand binding with intrinsically disordered proteins.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2013; 9e1003249Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The dynamic nature of the bHLH-LZ domain of c-Myc provides it the binding plasticity to interact with various other partners, like MIZ1 and SKP2. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are poorly structured proteins with a highly flexible backbone giving rise to an undefined secondary or tertiary structure (26Uversky V.N. Intrinsically disordered proteins from A to Z.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 1090-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 27Tompa P. Unstructural biology coming of age.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It is estimated that more than one-third of the entire human genome and more than 50% of transcription factors are disordered (28Oldfield C.J. Dunker A.K. Intrinsically disordered proteins and intrinsically disordered protein regions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 553-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 29Dunker A.K. Uversky V.N. Drugs for “protein clouds”: Targeting intrinsically disordered transcription factors.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2010; 10: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Increasing shreds of evidence have shown the implication of IDPs in disease, making them the critical target for therapeutic interventions (30Cheng Y. LeGall T. Oldfield C.J. Mueller J.P. Van Y.Y.J.

Biol. 2008; 15: 1149-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The traditional drug discovery approach targets the target protein's structured active site, leading to competitive or noncompetitive inhibition of the target. However, the IDPs behave as a ""protein cloud"" that lacks a structured active site and presents a conformational heterogeneity, thereby posing problems in the rational drug design (33Uversky V.N. Intrinsically disordered proteins and novel strategies for drug discovery.Expert Opin. Drug Discov. 2012; 7: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Overcoming these challenges, various approaches have been used to target an IDP via a small molecule (30Cheng Y. LeGall T. Oldfield C.J. Mueller J.P. Van Y.Y.J. Romero P. Cortese M.S. Uversky V.N. Dunker A.K. Rational drug design via intrinsically disordered protein.Trends Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 435-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The first one targets different disordered ensembles by a small molecule, and the second approach employs the targeting of the partner protein where binding of the small molecule with the partner protein will inhibit binding with the partner IDP target. Targeting the conformational ensembles of IDPs has emerged as a credible strategy because the molecule that can bind to the dynamic structure may potentially inhibit the interaction with the partner proteins. However, this strategy is quite challenging and complicated as the traditional drug discovery approach cannot be employed because of the lack of a well-characterized target structure. The interacting interface of c-Myc and MAX is relatively large, and all the residues shaping in this interface do not contribute equally to the binding free energy of c-Myc/MAX interaction. The critical amino acid residues, also called hot spots, exhibiting significant contribution in c-Myc and MAX interaction has not yet been previously characterized. Therefore, in the present study, we first identified the hot spot residues of this oncogenic dimer using the computational alanine scanning mutagenesis (ASM). The ASM is a powerful in silico approach that has been widely used to accurately identify the hot spot residues in a PPI via sequentially mutating the interface residues to alanine and calculating the change in binding free energy. The identified hot spots were then used to discover new inhibitor molecules via targeting the disordered c-Myc using the conformation ensemble approach. The screened molecules showed excellent binding with the disordered c-Myc, thereby inhibiting its regulatory functionality leading to apoptotic cell death of c-Myc expressing cancer and cancer stem cells (CSCs). To identify the hot spot residues in the c-Myc/MAX PPI complex, we have carried out molecular dynamic (MD) simulation for 40 ns using the simulated annealing with NMR-derived energy restraints (SANDER) and particle mesh Ewald molecular dynamics module of Amber software suit. The MD simulation trajectory snapshots were saved for every 200 ps and were analyzed using the CPPTRAJ module of Amber. The protein stability was evaluated based on its root mean square deviation (RMSD) from its initial coordinates. The evaluated protein backbone RMSD revealed that initially it raised to 5.5 Å for a period of 20 ns due to conformational changes in the terminal region of the c-Myc/MAX complex. Then, the protein backbone RMSD decreased to 3.5 Å and maintained stability throughout the simulation without much fluctuation (Fig. 1A). After MD simulation, the final 10% of the trajectory snapshots (last 4 ns frames) were used to calculate the binding free energy of the protein complex using the molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method and was found to be −115.85 kcal/mol (Table S3). Next, the per-residue energy decomposition was carried out to know the residue-wise energy contribution for the native protein–protein complex formation. The results revealed that the residues Leu917, Leu924, Gln927, Leu943, Ile950, Val953, Leu960, Leu967, Arg971, Leu974, and Leu978 of c-Myc were contributing more than −2.0 kcal/mol, whereas the remaining residues contributed less than −2.0 kcal/mol (Fig. 1B and Table S4). Following the per-residue energy contribution analysis, ASM was carried out to know the binding energy difference between the native and mutant protein complex. For this purpose, the residues of c-Myc in the interface region were mutated one by one to alanine, and the change in the binding-free energy between the native and the mutant complex was calculated (Fig. 1C and Table S4). Next, the residues were classified as hot spots (ΔΔG > 4.0 kcal/mol; Leu924, Gln927, Leu943, Ile950, Glu957, Arg971, and Leu974), warm spots (ΔΔG = 2.0–4.0 kcal/mol; Leu917, Phe921, Val953, Gln954, Glu956, Leu960, Glu964, Leu967, and Leu978), and null spots (ΔΔG < 2.0 kcal/mol; Glu916, Ser920, Asp926, Val941, Thr947, Glu963, and Lys977). The identified hot spot and warm spot residues of c-Myc are shown in Figure 1D. The identified hot spot and warm spot information was further used to screen the library of molecules with the potential to inhibit the functionality of c-Myc. Before examining the structural dynamics of c-Myc using MD simulation, seven well-known online disorder predictors were employed to examine the disorderness of the c-Myc’s bHLH-LZ region. According to our analysis, the predicted percentage of intrinsic disorder is calculated to be 50%, where residues at both terminals contributed equally, i.e., residues 897 to 917 at N terminal and residues 962 to 984 at C terminal. However, predictor of natural disordered regions pool predictors have predicted high propensity while other predictors have shown moderate disorder propensity (Fig. S1). Further, the all-atom MD simulation was carried out to gain further insight into the structural dynamics of a c-Myc peptide isolated from the MAX bound structure (PDB ID—1NKP). As observed in extensive simulations of ∼410 ns, the c-Myc structure loses helical composition and gains random coil conformation, primarily in its leucine-zipper motif region. Based on RMSD calculation, the structure showed higher deviations in the initial 25 ns and gained deviations up to 16 Å from 4 Å and then dropped minimally at 12 Å for the rest of the simulation period with minor variations (Fig. 1E). Similar trends were seen in the radius of gyration (RoG) analysis. Overall, this shows that the structure gains a stable conformation (Fig. 1E). Here, the rigorous MD simulation up to ∼410 ns of c-Myc structure yielded over 400 thousand conformations, sufficient to identify stable conformations. The RMSD and RoG plots were stable after 50 ns of simulation. These conformations were then mapped on two 2D histogram plots by considering RMSD and RoG concerning energy values from the simulations. As depicted in Figure 1F, the simulation frames are charted as RMSD versus energy, where the densest areas show the high population of frames on a scale of 0 to 3.5 with distinguished colors. All frames were found to have lied within a range of energy −79,100 to −78,600 kcal/mol and RMSD 1 to 18 Å. The higher number of frames with nearly identical parameters (encircled and arrowed at x- and y-axes in Fig. 1F) were found with RMSD 13 Å and energy approximately −78,925 kcal/mol. A similar analysis was performed with RoG and energy parameters, where the high population of frames was found with RoG 15 Å and energy approximately −78,925 kcal/mol (Fig. 1G). Then, based on these two sets of values, nearly 380 frames were identified, falling in the calculated ranges. Two frames at 170.23 ns (F1; obtained from RoG versus energy) and 326.37 ns (F2; obtained from RMSD versus energy) were finally chosen through manual inspection and were used for ensemble docking. High-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) has proven to be a distinctive approach in drug discovery because of certain benefits like time saving and cost-effectiveness. Hence, here we have screened nearly 30,000 compounds from the protein–protein interaction-focused library from Life Chemicals Inc against the two conformations (F1 and F2) of c-Myc. The LigPrep module generated 54,413 structures, which were screened through HTVS, standard precision (SP), and extra precision (XP) mode of docking. First, 30% of best scoring compounds were passed from HTVS to SP and SP to XP mode, and then 50% of compounds were passed for molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculation. With this, nearly 12,000 binding poses of all compounds were produced for both frames. Next, all the compounds were visually inspected for their molecular interaction with the identified hot spot and warm spot, all together with docking score and binding energy. Finally, seven compounds were purchased that showed appreciable binding and interaction with the hot spot residues against both the frames (F1 and F2) (Table S5). The ligand interaction analysis showed that among the identified hot spot and warm spot, the seven compounds commonly interacted with the Gln954, Glu956, and Glu957 residues of Frame-F1 (Fig. S2) and with residues Val953, Gln954, Glu956, and Glu957 of Frame-F2 (Fig. S3). Moreover, in both the frames, the compounds also interacted with residues Arg970 and His976, shaping the neighborhood of the hot spot and warm spot residues. The MM-GBSA scores (binding energy) of all complexes fall within a range of −20 to −50 kcal/mol. Collectively, the selected seven compounds showed substantial binding affinity against both the frames, which was plausible due to their interactions with the defined hot spot and warm spot residues. Based on the docking score and binding energy, we purchased seven compounds from Life Chemicals and studied their in vitro anticancer potential. Three c-Myc expressing cells were incubated with different concentrations of the purchased compounds and incubated for 48 h. Among the seven studied compounds, three compounds, i.e., F1288-0026, F2018-1398, and F2504-0393, did not show appreciating anticancer property, with an IC50 value of more than 15 μM (Fig. 2). One of the compounds, i.e., F1132-0721, showed a higher IC50 value against the two-cell line, while showed a relatively low IC50 value against HT-29, i.e., 2.48 ± 0.41 μM (Fig. 2). The rest of the three compounds, i.e., F0909-0073, F0909-0360, and F1021-0686, displayed significant anticancer potential in a dose-dependent manner against the three c-Myc-expressing cell lines (Fig. 2). The IC50 value for these three compounds was in the range of 0.209 ± 0.094 to 3.21 ± 0.75 μM, which was comparatively lesser than the reported c-Myc inhibitor, 10074-G5 (from our previous work, (34Singh A.

These three compounds were further studied on low-Myc expressing and noncancerous transformed cell lines, i.e., U-87 MG and HEK-293T, respectively. From Figure 3A, it can be inferred that these three compounds showed less cell-killing potential toward the U-87 MG and HEK-293T, which is evident from its high IC50 value (Fig. 3A). Based on appreciable cell-killing potential, these three compounds, i.e., F0909-0073, F0909-0360, and F1021-0686, were further studied to gain more insight into their antioncogenic potential. Further, the Annexin V/PI apoptosis assay showed that the three compounds induce apoptosis in the c-Myc expressing cell, HT-29. As depicted from Figure 3B, nearly 36%, 39%, and 43% of the cell population was in apoptotic quadrants when treated with 10 μM of F0909-0073, F0909-0360, and F1021-0686, respectively, for 24 h.Figure 3The top three compounds showed c-Myc-dependent apoptotic cell death.

After treating the D341 and HL-60 cell lines with different concentrations of the three-hit compounds, 1 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, which was later used for qPCR. For both cell lines, the qPCR data showed a significant decrease in the mRNA expression level of all the c-Myc target genes with increasing concentrations of all the compounds compared to untreated cells (Fig. 4A). Further, the protein level of c-Myc target genes (CAD, NOP58, and ODC1) was also analyzed after treating the D341 cell with increasing concentrations of the three-hit compounds for 36 h. Similar to the qPCR data, the Western blot analysis showed that the treatment of these three compounds leads to the translational repression of all the target genes (Fig. 4B). After the treatment with the compounds, a dose-dependent significant decrease in protein band intensity was observed for all the three c-Myc target genes. Thus, the qPCR and Western blot analysis indicated that the three compounds could inhibit Myc's function and therefore repression in Myc target genes was observed both at mRNA and protein level. Further, an array of c-Myc target genes were studied for the change in mRNA expression after the treatment with the compounds. The gene array analysis after the treatment of the compound is summarized in Figures 5 and S4. As seen from Fig. S4, the treatment with the compounds led to the change in mRNA expression of c-Myc target genes. The treatment of all three compounds showed a similar trend in the mRNA expression of the majority of the target genes. The heatmap shown in Figure 5A shows the expression fold change of the target gene mRNA compared to the untreated cells. Further, the scattered plot (Fig. 5, B–D) and the volcano plot (Fig. 5, E–G) for normalized gene expression were shown individually for the three compounds.Figure 5Gene array analysis of c-Myc target genes after the compound’s treatment.

Both undergraduate and post-graduate students (n = 398) participated in the study. Data were analysed using IBM-SPSS-26.Students acknowledged COVID-19 as a health risk, and their preventive behaviours were influenced by age, gender, marital status and living situation. Most students followed face mask guidelines but did not comply with lockdown restrictions. Social distancing was not always possible due to overcrowding. Students' main sources of COVID-19 information were local media (e.g., TV, radio) and social media. Most students (especially females) were unable to access online learning platforms due to poor internet connectivity, high costs and no access to computers. Meanwhile, a majority of those who studied online did not enjoy the experience. Students experienced depression, frustration, stress and anxiety during the lockdown; became less physically active and spent most of their time on social media, sleeping, eating or watching movies. Some students indulged in smoking, drinking alcohol, taking drugs and gambling for their first time, while others did them more often than before.The increase in sedentary activity, poor mental health and substance use over the lockdown period puts students at risk of health complications and poses a potential threat to the healthcare system. These risks may also negatively impact their future learning and academic potential. Further research is needed to understand the transitional experiences of students between physical and virtual learning, and how they can be supported. There is also a need to ascertain the feasibility of guidelines such as social distancing in developing countries, to increase compliance."
https://openalex.org/W4220732989,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have gained widespread attention as a new layer of regulation in biological processes during development and disease. The lncRNA ELDR (EGFR long noncoding downstream RNA) was recently shown to be highly expressed in oral cancers as compared to adjacent nontumor tissue, and we previously reported that ELDR may be an oncogene as inhibition of ELDR reduces tumor growth in oral cancer models. Furthermore, overexpression of ELDR induces proliferation and colony formation in normal oral keratinocytes (NOKs). In this study, we examined in further detail how ELDR drives the neoplastic transformation of normal keratinocytes. We performed RNA-seq analysis on NOKs stably expressing ELDR (NOK-ELDR), which revealed that ELDR enhances the expression of cell cycle-related genes. Expression of Aurora kinase A and its downstream targets Polo-like kinase 1, cell division cycle 25C, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, and cyclin B1 (CCNB1) are significantly increased in NOK-ELDR cells, suggesting induction of G2/M progression. We further identified CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) as a binding partner of ELDR in NOK-ELDR cells. We show that ELDR stabilizes CTCF and increases its expression. Finally, we demonstrate the ELDR-CTCF axis upregulates transcription factor Forkhead box M1, which induces Aurora kinase A expression and downstream G2/M transition. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of the lncRNA ELDR as a potential driver of oral cancer during neoplastic transformation of normal keratinocytes."

https://openalex.org/W4225837776,"Adipocytes regulate the body’s metabolism by secreting adipokines to maintain energy homeostasis. Asprosin is a new type of adipokine, and its relationship with obesity remains controversial. There are a few reports on the effect of long-term exercise on serum asprosin level. This study aimed to investigate the effects of body mass index (BMI) and exercise/sedentary habit on serum asprosin in male college students as well as the relationship between serum asprosin and body composition and related metabolic indicators and provided a basis for further exploration of the biological function of asprosin. Ninety-six male college students were classified into the sedentary habit group (SD; 48) and the special training experience group (ET; 48). Both groups included three subgroups of normal BMI, overweight, and obesity, with 16 people in each subgroup. One-way analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and Pearson correlation analysis were performed. The results showed that serum asprosin levels in the obesity subgroup were significantly higher than those in the normal and overweight subgroups. Excluding BMI interference, there were no significant differences in serum asprosin between the SD and ET groups; however, there were significant differences in body composition, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10. Asprosin was positively correlated with BMI, body fat percentage, visceral fat area, fasting insulin, insulin resistance homeostasis model, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and leptin levels and was negatively correlated with relative lean body mass, relative skeletal muscle mass, high-density lipoprotein, and interleukin-10, and adiponectin levels. In conclusion, serum asprosin is closely related to body weight, body composition, glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and fat hormones. Long-term exercise training cannot prevent BMI increase from increasing serum asprosin level. If the influence of BMI is excluded, long-term exercise training does not affect serum asprosin."
https://openalex.org/W4225984179,"Ruminococcus bromii is a keystone species in the human gut that has the rare ability to degrade dietary resistant starch (RS). This bacterium secretes a suite of starch-active proteins that work together within larger complexes called amylosomes that allow R. bromii to bind and degrade RS. Starch adherence system protein 20 (Sas20) is one of the more abundant proteins assembled within amylosomes, but little could be predicted about its molecular features based on amino acid sequence. Here, we performed a structure-function analysis of Sas20 and determined that it features two discrete starch-binding domains separated by a flexible linker. We show that Sas20 domain 1 contains an N-terminal β-sandwich followed by a cluster of α-helices, and the nonreducing end of maltooligosaccharides can be captured between these structural features. Furthermore, the crystal structure of a close homolog of Sas20 domain 2 revealed a unique bilobed starch-binding groove that targets the helical α1,4-linked glycan chains found in amorphous regions of amylopectin and crystalline regions of amylose. Affinity PAGE and isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated that both domains bind maltoheptaose and soluble starch with relatively high affinity (Kd ≤ 20 μM) but exhibit limited or no binding to cyclodextrins. Finally, small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of the individual and combined domains support that these structures are highly flexible, which may allow the protein to adopt conformations that enhance its starch-targeting efficiency. Taken together, we conclude that Sas20 binds distinct features within the starch granule, facilitating the ability of R. bromii to hydrolyze dietary RS."

We set out to evaluate the performance of the osteoporosis self-assessment tool for Asians (OSTA) and the osteoporosis screening tool for Chinese (OSTC) for the early screening of osteoporosis in postmenopausal Vietnamese women. Methods We analyzed retrospective data from 797 postmenopausal Vietnamese women. The bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar vertebrae (L1–L4) and the left and right femoral necks of all participants were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Osteoporosis was defined as the BMD (T-score) &lt; -2.5. The OSTA and OSTC scores were calculated from the age and weight of participants. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to compare the performance of the two tools with the BMD measurements by DXA at different anatomical sites. Results The rates of osteoporosis determined by BMD varied between anatomical sites, and ranged from 43.4% to 54.7% in the lumbar vertebrae and 29.2% and 8.9% in the left and right femoral necks, respectively. For the vertebrae, the area under the curve (AUC) for OSTA ranged from 70.9% to 73.9% and for OSTC ranged from 68.7% to 71.6%. The predictive value of both tools was higher for femoral necks, with the AUC of OSTA for the left and right femoral necks being 80.0% and 85.8%, respectively. The corresponding figures for OSTC were 80.5% and 86.4%, respectively. The highest sensitivity and specificity of OSTA were 74.6% and 81.4%, while these figures for OSTC were 73.9% and 82.6%, respectively. Conclusion OSTA and OSTC were shown to be useful self-assessment tools for osteoporosis detection in Vietnam postmenopausal women. Further research is encouraged to determine the applicability of tools for other populations and settings."

Despite more than 90% of documented cases being classified as “recovered” from SARS-CoV-2 infection, a proportion of patients reported a wide variety of persisting symptoms after the initial onset or acute phase of the infection, often referred to as “Long Covid”. As data on the symptomatology of post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection gradually becomes available, there is an urgent need to organise and synthesise the data in order to define what constitutes Long Covid and assist with its management in clinical and community settings. Methods This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search strategy will be developed in accordance with the Cochrane highly sensitive search guidelines. The following electronic databases will be searched for studies to include in the systematic review and meta-analysis: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), Science direct, EMBASE, Mednar, Psych INFO, and EBSCOhost. Dual screening will be applied at every screening stage. Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full text of potentially eligible studies following the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to select studies to include in the review. As heterogeneity is anticipated between the included studies, data will be pooled in a meta-analysis using a random effects model. A clustering analytic approach will be applied to identify symptoms groupings and assign the symptoms into clusters. R statistical software will be used for the meta-analysis. Highly heterogenous data will be synthesised narratively. The studies will be assessed, for quality using quality assessment tools appropriate for each study design. Two reviewers will independently undertake the quality of studies assessments.

Failure to resolve the transient accumulation of such proteins results in UPR-mediated programmed cell death. Loss of tumor suppressor gene or oncogene addiction in cancer cells can result in sustained higher basal UPR levels; however, it is not clear if these higher basal UPR levels in cancer cells can be exploited as a therapeutic strategy. We hypothesized that covalent modification of surface-exposed cysteine (SEC) residues could simulate unfolded/misfolded proteins to activate the UPR, and that higher basal UPR levels in cancer cells would provide the necessary therapeutic window. To test this hypothesis, here we synthesized analogs that can covalently modify multiple SEC residues and evaluated them as UPR activators. We identified a spirocyclic dimer, SpiD7, and evaluated its effects on UPR activation signals, that is, XBP1 splicing, phosphorylation of eIF2α, and a decrease in ATF 6 levels, in normal and cancer cells, which were further confirmed by RNA-Seq analyses. We found that SpiD7 selectively induced caspase-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells, whereas normal cells exhibited robust XBP1 splicing, indicating adaptation to stress. Furthermore, SpiD7 inhibited the growth of high-grade serous carcinoma cell lines ~3-15-fold more potently than immortalized fallopian tube epithelial (paired normal control) cells and reduced clonogenic growth of high-grade serous carcinoma cell lines.

Failure to restore proteostasis activates an apoptosis program.

Under acute endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions, adaptation mechanisms, such as expression of chaperones to increase folding capacity and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) proteins to clear misfolded proteins, are activated to restore normal homeostasis (9Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. Activation of ATF6 and an ATF6 DNA binding site by the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). However, under chronic ER stress, the adaptation mechanisms are overwhelmed, and cell death pathways are activated by, among others, transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (12Korennykh A. Walter P. Structural basis of the unfolded protein response.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2012; 28: 251-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition to cell extrinsic stressors that are transiently experienced by normal cells, tumor cells also face cell intrinsic stressors such as loss of tumor suppressors and oncogene addiction. A recent study showed that loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 in high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) was associated with a higher burden of misfolded proteins. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 loss resulted in (a) higher basal levels of UPR-associated proteins and (b) increased sensitivity to bortezomib (13Chui M.H. Doodnauth S.A. Erdmann N. Tiedemann R.E. Sircoulomb F. Drapkin R. Shaw P. Rottapel R. Chromosomal instability and mTORC1 activation through PTEN loss contribute to proteotoxic stress in ovarian carcinoma.Cancer Res. 2019; 79: 5536-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This higher basal proteostasis makes cancer cells particularly vulnerable to UPR activation–induced apoptosis. Figure 1 is a model for the aforementioned, wherein the resting proteostasis in cancer and normal cells is shown in red and green, respectively. The effect of UPR activation is shown as red and green arrows in cancer and normal cells, respectively. The therapeutic window shown as a double-headed arrow, that is, the difference between the resting proteostasis levels of cancer cells and normal cells is the same for UPR activators and UPR inhibitors. Theoretically, from a therapeutic standpoint, UPR activators will drive cancer cells toward apoptosis, whereas UPR inhibitors will reduce the proliferative capacity of the cancer cells. UPR activation is regulated by three major pathways, namely activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), protein kinase R–like ER kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). Although all three pathways upregulate the expression of chaperones, IRE1 and PERK pathways also upregulate ERAD and apoptosis-associated genes, respectively. Activation of UPR pathways is monitored by specific readouts. Decrease in ATF6 levels serves as a sensor for ATF6 pathway activation. Thapsigargin (Tg)-induced ER Ca2+ depletion leads to the proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound ATF6 to release soluble ATF6(p50), which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of the chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) (11Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mammalian transcription factor ATF6 is synthesized as a transmembrane protein and activated by proteolysis in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Hypoxia-induced stress leads to the activation of PERK pathway. This is indicated by hyperphosphorylation of PERK and phosphorylation of serine 51 (pS51) on eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) (14Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M. Rastani S. Diehl A.

Increased level of unfolded proteins causes IRE1-dependent splicing of a small intron from X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) (15Shen X. Ellis R.E. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Yang K. Solomon A. Yoshida H.

Spliced XBP1 is a sensor for the IRE1–XBP1 pathway that transcriptionally regulates levels of ERAD components (18Yamamoto K. Suzuki N. Wada T. Okada T. Yoshida H. Kaufman R.J. Mori K.

A wide array of small molecules that directly or indirectly perturb UPR have been reported (19Grandjean J.M.D. Wiseman R.L.

The therapeutic window, that is, the difference in resting proteostasis in cancer cells versus normal cells, suggests that both UPR inhibitors and UPR activators can be explored as cancer therapeutics (Fig. 1). Examples include BiP inhibitor YUM70 that exhibits in vitro and in vivo effects in pancreatic cancer models (20Lee A.S.

Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 7193-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Along with PERK, general control nonderepressible 2 and heme-regulated inhibitory kinase are eIF2α kinases that are known to elicit integrated stress response. An example of a direct activator of UPR is the urea analog (3r) that inhibited tumor growth by heme-regulated inhibitory kinase–mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α (28Yefidoff-Freedman R. Fan J. Yan L.

Med. Chem. 2017; 60: 5392-5406PubMed Google Scholar). UPR activators that do not directly target the proteins associated with UPR have also been identified. Compound 147, identified through an elegant screen, covalently modifies protein disulfide isomerases to preferentially activate ATF6 (29Paxman R. Plate L. Blackwood E.A. Glembotski C. Powers E.T.

Pharmacologic ATF6 activating compounds are metabolically activated to selectively modify endoplasmic reticulum proteins.Elife. 2018; 7e37168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibitors (Velcade, Ninlaro, and Kyprolis) elevate the levels of ubiquitinated proteins, thereby activating UPR-mediated cell death. A characteristic of misfolded proteins is a higher percentage of surface-exposed hydrophobic patches. This is recognized by the endogenous protein quality control machinery and activates their degradation. This inspired several laboratories to append hydrophobic tags to high-affinity small molecules to drive the degradation of the target proteins (30Neklesa T.K. Tae H.S. Schneekloth A.R. Stulberg M.J.

Along these lines, we explored covalent modification of surface-exposed cysteine (SEC) residues to simulate elevated levels of unfolded/misfolded proteins to selectively induce UPR-mediated cancer cell death. We previously reported the discovery of a spirocyclic compound with an α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone (19) that covalently modified NF-κB pathway proteins, RELA (v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A) and IKKβ (inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit beta), by targeting SECs (39Rana S.

Stapling proteins in the RELA complex inhibits TNFalpha-induced nuclear translocation of RELA.RSC Chem. Biol. 2022; 3: 32-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify proteome-wide targets of analog 19, we conducted a click-mass spectrometry (MS) study using an alkyne-tagged analog 19 (Fig. 2). A total of 635 proteins were covalently bound by analog 19 (peptide threshold >95%; protein threshold >99% with one peptide minimum) from two runs (Table S1). RELA and IKKβ are low abundant proteins, and they were not identified in the click-MS study. The biological replicates recalled ∼53% (339) of proteins that were bound to analog 19, and 6% of the recalled proteins are localized to the ER (42Sprenger J. Lynn Fink J. Karunaratne S. Hanson K. Hamilton N.A. Teasdale R.D. LOCATE: A mammalian protein subcellular localization database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D230-D233Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Pathway analysis (reactome, version 79; reactome.org) revealed that 14 of 20 most significant pathways were related to translation of proteins (Table S2). Since analog 19 covalently modifies >330 proteins, we hypothesized that a dimer of analog 19 with two covalent modifiers would either covalently modify multiple residues in these proteins to mimic a large hydrophobic patch on the surface or bind to proximal Cys residues on two proteins to simulate a misfolded protein and activate UPR. To test this hypothesis, we assembled dimers of analog 19 with 7-carbon and 12-carbon linkers (SpiD7 and SpiD12) along with an acyclic dimer (SpiD7-A), dimer without the covalent modifier (SpiD7-R), and a diiodo compound (SpiD7-C) and evaluated them for UPR activation. Briefly, OVCAR5 cells were incubated with the aforementioned compounds (Fig. 3A), and the lysates were probed for proteins in the UPR pathways (Fig. 3B). The results showed that SpiD7 was the only compound that reduced full-length ATF6 levels which is indicative of cleavage-induced activation and induced XBP1 splicing. We also observed PERK activation (the slower moving p-PERK band) resulting in eIF2α phosphorylation. Moreover, in SpiD7-treated lysates, we observed reduced caspase 7 and 9 levels, along with increased levels of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). We did not observe any such effects in 19, SpiD12, SpiD7-A, SpiD7-R, and SpiD7-C indicating that the (a) linker length, (b) spirocyclic core, and (c) Michael acceptor contribute to UPR activation and induction of apoptosis. Consistently, results from a growth inhibition assay showed that SpiD7 was the most potent among the panel of analogs screened (Fig. 3C). The levels of SEC residues are greater in unfolded proteins as compared with their folded counterparts. A thiol probe tetraphenylethene maleimide (TPE-MI) was used to measure unfolded protein levels in cells by binding to free sulfhydryl groups on cysteine residues present on unfolded proteins, which are otherwise buried in their folded counterparts (43Zhang S.

We observed high TPE-MI fluorescence in cancer cells suggesting elevated levels of SECs (unfolded proteins) (Figs. 3D and S1). Next, we treated FT282C11 and OVCAR5 cells with 19 or SpiD7 to determine their effect on UPR activation. In dimethyl sulfoxide–treated samples, we observed elevated levels of splicedXBP1 in OVCAR5 cells when compared with FT282C11 cells (Fig. 3E, lanes 1 versus 4). This suggests that UPR is activated (higher resting proteostasis, Fig. 1) in resting cancer cells compared with normal cells. Analog 19 did not affect the levels of pS51-eIF2α, XBP1 splicing, or ATF6, demonstrating that 19 does not activate UPR in either OVCAR5 or FT282C11 cells (Fig. 3E, lanes 1 versus 2 and 4 versus 5). In SpiD7-treated FT282C11 (Fig. 3E, lanes 1 versus 3) and OVCAR5 (Fig. 3E, lanes 4 versus 6) cells, we observed an increase in pS51-eIF2α levels. A robust increase in XBP1 levels was observed in SpiD7-treated FT282C11, whereas no such increase was observed in OVCAR5 cells (Fig. 3E, lanes 1 and 3 versus 4 and 6). SpiD7 nonselectively activated ATF6 (Fig. 3E, lanes 3 and 6), which is consistent with reported small-molecule probes that covalently target cysteine residues on protein disulfide isomerases to activate ATF6 (29Paxman R. Plate L. Blackwood E.A. Glembotski C. Powers E.T. Wiseman R.L. Kelly J.W. Pharmacologic ATF6 activating compounds are metabolically activated to selectively modify endoplasmic reticulum proteins.Elife. 2018; 7e37168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed a more robust CleavedCaspase 7 and CleavedPARP levels in SpiD7-treated OVCAR5 cells when compared with FT282C11 cells (Fig. 3E, lanes 3 versus 6). We also compared SpiD7 and the classical UPR activator Tg for induction of apoptosis in normal and cancer cells (Fig. S2). Unlike Tg, SpiD7-mediated PARP cleavage is approximately 2.7-fold higher in OVCAR5 cells as compared with FT282C11 cells. To further assess if SpiD7 activates UPR, OVCAR5 cells were treated with SpiD7 and incubated for 2, 6, and 12 h. RNA isolated from these samples was sequenced by the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) sequencing core. Representative volcano plot describing differential RNA expression between vehicle-treated and SpiD7-treated cancer cells for 2 h is shown in Figure 4A (please see Fig. S3 for the volcano plot for the 6 and 12 time points). A greater than two-fold gene expression change was observed in >113 genes at a false discovery of rate <0.05. Gene set enrichment analysis showed a time-dependent increase in the normalized enrichment scores for the hallmark UPR gene set (Fig. 4B, 6 h treatment and Fig. S3 for the 2 and 12 h treatment). Euclidean cluster analysis greater than twofold change for the Gene Oontology ER stress and hallmark UPR gene set for 2, 6, and 12 h treatment is summarized in Figure 4C and Fig. S4, respectively. A time-dependent increase in the expression for majority of genes (ATF3, HERPUD1, CHAC1, DNAJC3, WIPI1, CEBPB, DDIT4, ERN1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 [EIF2AK3], ATF4, DNAJB9, XBP1, heat shock protein family A member 5 [HSPA5], and TSPYL2) in the Gene Ontology ER stress and the hallmark UPR gene set was observed demonstrating induction of UPR. Of note, overexpression of genes CHAC1, ATF3, ATF4, and EIF2AK3 are associated with proapoptotic effects mediated by the PERK/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway. Western blot analyses with lysates of the time-course study done in parallel revealed a time-dependent increase of BiP (GRP78) and pS51-eIF2α in SpiD7-treated cells (Fig. 4D). The time-dependent increase in CHOP and PARP cleavage suggests inability of the cancer cells to overcome the SpiD7-induced covalent modification of proteins (Fig. 4D). Next, to determine the relative potency of the SpiD7 and 19 to inhibit growth of HGSC cell lines (47Domcke S. Sinha R. Levine D.A. Sander C. Schultz N.

On an average, SpiD7 was approximately sixfold more potent than 19 in inhibiting HGSC cell growth. SpiD7 was approximately 3- to 15-fold more potent in inhibiting the growth of HGSC cells over FT282C11 cells (Fig. 5A). To assess the ability of SpiD7 to inhibit colony formation, OVCAR8 and CaOV3 cells were subjected to 7- and 14-day clonogenic assay, respectively (Fig. 5B).

Investigating mass email risk communication-related impacts on students in a tertiary educational context has revealed a significant deficit in emergency response research, practice, and policymaking. Mandatory temporary university and college closures during the COVID-19 first wave provided an opportunity to address this research and practice deficit, as most Canadian and American universities/colleges administered their eviction communication via daily mass email chains. Through a phenomenological lens, this study interviewed twenty out-of-province/state and international students, ten from each country respectively, to examine student eviction experiences associated with intensive mass email risk communication. This research identified four factors linked to mass email risk communication: email chain characteristics, student interpretation, interdepartmental cooperation, and frontline voices. Synthesizing these findings, four evidence-based recommendations were developed: to efficiently convey risk information to students, to understand student perceptions and to inform their behaviors, to enhance interdepartmental cooperation, and to enable mutual dialogue in decision making. These recommendations could assist post-secondary institutions, and other organizations, in strengthening their mass email risk communication strategies and advancing organizational emergency response plans for future extreme events."
https://openalex.org/W4225972068,"Influenza infection continues to be a hazard to the Saudi population, resulting in high death rates and illness prevalence; it also places a substantial financial burden on the government. The government takes several strategies and approaches through the Ministry of Health has shown great success in curbing the disease. Vaccination is considered the most appropriate control measure; unfortunately, most Saudi residents, particularly in the city of Riyadh, do not consider vaccination a safe health practice. As a result, many have not participated in the influenza vaccine immunisation programme. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) of seasonal influenza and influenza vaccine immunisation among clients visiting primary healthcare centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the study investigated the relationship between participants' demographics and their KAPs regarding influenza vaccination. A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study was conducted among 611 individuals who visited four of Riyadh's primary healthcare centers: Alsylimania, Alwady, Alyasmin, and Alsahafah. A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess the KAPs of participants, with questions regarding seasonal influenza and influenza vaccine immunisation. The scores of participants' knowledge showed that the majority had good knowledge regarding seasonal flu (64.5%) and the flu vaccine (73.3%). Furthermore, only 52% of participants had a positive attitude score towards the seasonal influenza vaccination. Despite that, significant knowledge gaps and mistaken beliefs regarding certain aspects of influenza were noted in participants, resulting in negative attitudes and perceptions as well as a reduced likelihood of being vaccinated. In this study, 43.7% of participants (267 out of 611) had ever received a flu vaccine. Participants with a history of previous vaccination had a significantly higher level of knowledge and more positive attitudes, which resulted in increased vaccination coverage. Therefore, educational strategies to improve knowledge regarding influenza in Riyadh are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4226172703,"Wildlife corridors are typically designed for single species, yet holistic conservation approaches require corridors suitable for multiple species. Modelling habitat linkages for wildlife is based on several modelling steps (each involving multiple choices), and in the case of multi-species corridors, an approach to optimize single species corridors to few or a single functional corridor for multiple species. To model robust corridors for multiple species and simultaneously evaluate the impact of methodological choices, we develop a multi-method approach to delineate corridors that effectively capture movement of multiple wildlife species, while limiting the area required. Using wildlife presence data collected along ground-based line transects between Lake Manyara and Tarangire National Parks, Tanzania, we assessed species-habitat association in both ensemble and stacked species distribution frameworks and used these to estimate linearly and non-linearly scaled landscape resistances for seven ungulate species. We evaluated habitat suitability and least-cost and circuit theory-based connectivity models for each species individually and generated a multi-species corridor. Our results revealed that species-habitat relationships and subsequent corridors differed across species, but the pattern of predicted landscape connectivity across the study area was similar for all seven species regardless of method (circuit theory or least-cost) and scaling of the habitat suitability-based cost surface (linear or non-linear). Stacked species distribution models were highly correlated with the seven species for all model outputs (r = 0.79 to 0.97), while having the greatest overlap with the individual species least-cost corridors (linear model: 61.6%; non-linear model: 60.2%). Zebra was the best single-species proxy for landscape connectivity. Overall, we show that multi-species corridors based on stacked species distribution models achieve relatively low cumulative costs for savanna ungulates as compared to their respective single-species corridors. Given the challenges and costs involved in acquiring data and parameterizing corridor models for multiple species, zebra may act as a suitable proxy species for ungulate corridor conservation in this system."
https://openalex.org/W4220761957,"Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease. Pertussis toxin (PT), a major virulence factor secreted by B. pertussis, is an AB5-type protein complex topologically related to cholera toxin. The PT protein complex is internalized by host cells and follows a retrograde trafficking route to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it subsequently dissociates. The released enzymatic S1 subunit is then translocated from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol and subsequently ADP-ribosylates the inhibitory alpha-subunits (Gαi) of heterotrimeric G proteins, thus promoting dysregulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling. However, the mechanistic details of the ADP-ribosylation activity of PT are not well understood. Here, we describe crystal structures of the S1 subunit in complex with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), with NAD+ hydrolysis products ADP-ribose and nicotinamide, with NAD+ analog PJ34, and with a novel NAD+ analog formed upon S1 subunit crystallization with 3-amino benzamide and NAD+, which we name benzamide amino adenine dinucleotide. These crystal structures provide unprecedented insights into pre- and post-NAD+ hydrolysis steps of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of PT. We propose that these data may aid in rational drug design approaches and further development of PT-specific small-molecule inhibitors."

Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are noncatalytic globular protein domains attached to carbohydrate-active enzymes that strengthen enzyme affinity to substrates and increase enzymatic efficiency via targeting and proximity effects. CBMs are considered auspicious for various biotechnological purposes in textile, food, and feed industries, representing valuable tools in basic science research and biomedicine. Here, we present the first crystallographic structure of a CBM8 family member (CBM8), DdCBM8, from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, which was identified attached to an endo-β-1,4-glucanase (glycoside hydrolase family 9). We show that the planar carbohydrate-binding site of DdCBM8, composed of aromatic residues, is similar to type A CBMs that are specific for crystalline (multichain) polysaccharides. Accordingly, pull-down assays indicated that DdCBM8 was able to bind insoluble forms of cellulose. However, affinity gel electrophoresis demonstrated that DdCBM8 also bound to soluble (single chain) polysaccharides, especially glucomannan, similar to type B CBMs, although it had no apparent affinity for oligosaccharides. Therefore, the structural characteristics and broad specificity of DdCBM8 represent exceptions to the canonical CBM classification. In addition, mutational analysis identified specific amino acid residues involved in ligand recognition, which are conserved throughout the CBM8 family. This advancement in the structural and functional characterization of CBMs contributes to our understanding of carbohydrate-active enzymes and protein–carbohydrate interactions, pushing forward protein engineering strategies and enhancing the potential biotechnological applications of glycoside hydrolase accessory modules.

This advancement in the structural and functional characterization of CBMs contributes to our understanding of carbohydrate-active enzymes and protein–carbohydrate interactions, pushing forward protein engineering strategies and enhancing the potential biotechnological applications of glycoside hydrolase accessory modules. Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are enzymes capable of breaking glycosidic bonds. They are found in all living beings and are involved in essential functions, such as cell wall modeling, defense, symbiosis, signaling, biosynthesis, and nutrient acquisition (1Minic Z. Physiological roles of plant glycoside hydrolases.Planta. 2008; 227: 723-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These enzymes are broadly applied in the industrial production of paper, fabrics, and food and have gained visibility in biorefining processes for conversion of biomass into renewable fuels and chemicals (2Kirk O. Borchert T.V. Fuglsang C.C. Industrial enzyme applications.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 3Linares-Pasten J. Andersson M. Karlsson E.

Caz Ten years of CAZypedia: A living encyclopedia of carbohydrate-active enzymes.Glycobiology. 2018; 28: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). GHs are composed of a catalytic domain, which is often covalently linked to one or more accessory modules that regulate their activity, such as carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). CBMs are discrete folding units capable of binding to different types of carbohydrates, and their main role is to mediate the interaction between the enzyme and the target substrate, leading to modifications in catalytic efficiency (5Boraston A.B.

More specifically, CBMs perform functions such as increasing substrate accessibility through disruption of the crystalline structure of cellulose (6Din N. Gilkes N.R. Tekant B. Miller R.C.

Molecular characterization of a family 5 glycoside hydrolase suggests an induced-fit enzymatic mechanism.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 23473Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To date, CBMs have been grouped into 89 different families in the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) database based on amino acid sequence similarities (10Lombard V. Golaconda Ramulu H. Drula E.

CBMs are also classified based on their functional properties: type A CBMs possess flat binding faces, capable of binding to crystalline polysaccharides; type B CBMs bind internally to soluble polysaccharides via cleft-shaped contact sites; and type C CBMs interact with the terminal regions of carbohydrates through protein pocket–shaped sites (5Boraston A.B.

CBMs are considered auspicious for various biotechnological purposes, such as modification of the physical properties of fibers and potentiating enzymatic degradation of polysaccharides (12Mello B.L.

CBMs are valuable tools in basic science research, used on in situ visualizations of polysaccharides, in vivo expression in plant physiology studies (14Mei X. Chang Y. Shen J. Zhang Y. Xue C.

In synthetic biology initiatives, these protein modules are used as building blocks to construct minicellulosomes (16Kim S. Baek S.H. Lee K. Hahn J.S.

In biomedicine, CBMs are employed to functionalize carbohydrate-based biomaterial and improve recombinant protein technology, promoting expression, purification, stabilization, and immobilization of heterologous proteins (17Oliveira C.

In this sense, the CBMs were employed for expression at the surface of proteins of pathogens (17Oliveira C. Carvalho V. Domingues L. Gama F.M.

Cell Fact. 2022; 21: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The number of different sequences deposited in CAZy and the number of families have been rapidly increasing because of next-generation sequencing technologies (21Kameshwar A.K.S. Qin W. Recent developments in using advanced sequencing technologies for the genomic studies of lignin and cellulose degrading microorganisms.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2016; 12: 156-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Occasionally, members from novel or poorly studied families reveal new characteristics that show uncertainties in the current classifications (22Campos B.M. Liberato M.V. Alvarez T.M. Zanphorlin L.M.

Chem. 2016; 291: 23734-23743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) as well as disclose opportunities to be explored for biotechnological purposes. Therefore, we selected CBM8 (DdCBM8) from the endo-β-1,4-glucanase (CelA) of Dictyostelium discoideum (Fig. 1). DdCBM8 is located at the C-terminal region of CelA and is connected to the catalytic GH9 domain through a threonine–glutamate–threonine–proline repeat linker (23Ramalingam R. Blume J.E. Ennis H.L. The Dictyostelium discoideum spore germination-specific cellulase is organized into functional domains.J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7834-7837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to our studies, the DdCBM8 presented a planar binding site and has the ability of binding to insoluble crystalline cellulose, conferring type A CBM characteristics. However, DdCBM8 showed highest affinity for soluble polysaccharides, such as glucomannan, resembling type B CBMs. We aimed to study the DdCBM8 using biochemical and biophysical methods to determine the unique structural and functional properties to provide novel insights into CBM–ligand interactions that can be useful for protein engineering strategies, increasing the biotechnological application space of GH accessory modules. The gene encoding DdCBM8, comprising amino acid residues 555 to 705 from full-length CelA (Fig. 1), was inserted into the pET28a(+) bacterial vector, expressed in soluble form using Escherichia coli as the host, and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using affinity and size-exclusion chromatography (data not shown). Initially, a pull-down assay was performed to determine whether DdCBM8 binds to insoluble polysaccharides. About 10 micrograms of DdCBM8 were incubated with 35 mg/ml of Avicel and bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC). After several washing steps, the protein bound to the polysaccharides was detected with SDS gel. As shown in Figure 2A, DdCBM8 was able to bind to both the polysaccharides (protein is present in the insoluble fraction). An attempt to determine the affinity constant to insoluble polysaccharides was performed using depletion isotherm assay, where different amounts of DdCBM8 were incubated with constant concentration of each ligand, and the plot of bound versus unbound (free) protein could reveal the affinity constants. In fact, the binding was confirmed (Fig. 3A). However, saturation was not achieved, precluding determination of the affinity of DdCBM8 for BMCC and Avicel.Figure 3Quantitative assessment of binding of DdCBM8 to soluble and insoluble polysaccharides.

Basically, nondenaturing gels polymerized with different polysaccharides were used in electrophoresis, and the protein migration was reduced when binding occurred between protein and ligand, in comparison to a gel lacking the ligand (native). As shown in Figure 2B, DdCBM8 bound to xyloglucan, glucomannan, β-glucan, and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), but not to xylan. Subsequently, intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy was performed to monitor (Fig. 3B) and estimate the binding capacity of DdCBM8 to these polysaccharides (Fig. 3C and Table S1). The data were fit to a one-site binding model. The average molecular weight (MW) of polysaccharides was employed to determine the binding constants to these polysaccharides, although this approach may overestimate the affinity as each chain can often bind multiple CBMs. The DdCBM8 binding constant (Ka) for glucomannan was 13.3 × 104 M−1, whereas for β-glucan and HEC was 3.1 × 104 M−1 and 0.66 × 104 M−1, respectively. Affinity for xyloglucan was also detected; however, as no average MW was given by manufacturers owing to its heterogeneity, the binding affinity constant was not determined. Finally, no binding of DdCBM8 to xylan or any tested oligosaccharide, such as cellopentaose, cellohexaose, and xyloglucan heptasaccharide (X3Glc4 or XXXG, where X stands for a glucose decorated with xylose and G indicates an undecorated glucose) could be detected, based on fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry (data not shown) methods. Native DdCBM8 crystallographic structure was determined at 1.51 Å resolution. Initial phases were determined using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using anomalous scattering of iodine, as described in the Experimental procedures section. At the end of refinement, the derivative dataset (resolution of 1.8 Å) displayed 13 iodine atoms with occupancies varying from 0.42 to 0.83. The statistics for data collection and refinement are presented in Table S2. The final crystal structure presented a monomer in the asymmetric unit, and all amino acid residues (555–705) were built with well-defined electron densities. The amino terminal end also contained three residues (552–554; Ser, His, and Met) derived from the cloning vector, pET28a(+). DdCBM8 has a compact globular β-sandwich fold, typical of the CBMs, and composed of two antiparallel β-sheets with five and six β-strands (β1, β4, β6, β7, and β9, and strands β2, β3, β5, β8, β10, and β11) that are connected by loops and one α-helix (Fig. 4). A structural comparison conducted with DALI server (24Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: Conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (2972) Google Scholar) and PDBeFold server (25Krissinel E. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar) revealed that DdCBM8 shared low similarity with members of other CBM families: CBM11 (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 1V0A), with 2.02 Å rmsd; CBM30 (PDB ID: 1WZX), with 2.02 Å rmsd; and CBM29 (PDB ID: 1GWM), with 2.15 Å rmsd. Attempts to cocrystallize and soaking with xyloglucan heptasaccharide (XXXG) and cello-oligosaccharides (cellopentaose and cellohexaose) failed, which is consistent with the absence of affinity determined for these ligands. However, three aromatic residues exposed to solvent (W572, W574, and Y600) formed a planar surface resembling a typical ligand-binding site in type A CBMs (Fig. 5). Despite the overall low structural similarity with other CBMs, these aromatic residues were significantly aligned with the binding site of a member of the CBM29 family, CBM29-2 (PDB ID: 1GWM) (26Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Szabó L. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Promiscuity in ligand-binding: The three-dimensional structure of a Piromyces carbohydrate-binding module, CBM29-2, in complex with cello- and mannohexaose.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14077-14082Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which was cocrystallized with cellohexaose. Both CBMs (DdCBM8 and CBM29-2) present the same three aromatic residues in similar positions, which in the case of CBM29-2 were responsible for ligand binding through CH–π interactions. Furthermore, two other residues that are involved in ligand stabilization through hydrogen bonding in CBM29-2, share common positions: R634 and Q686 from DdCBM8 and K74 and Q116 from CBM29-2, respectively (Fig. 5A). The main difference in the binding sites is the presence of another three amino acids (E78, E83, and R112) in CBM29-2, which interact with the ligand through hydrogen bonds, but not in DdCBM8. Furthermore, DdCBM8 has three residues shorter β-strand (β7) compared with that in CBM29-2, which is responsible for creating a cleft where the ligand chain fits (Fig. 5B). The shorter β-strand found in DdCBM8 confers a planar shape for this region that probably allows crystalline polysaccharide binding. To confirm the ligand-binding site inferred from the crystallographic structure and to evaluate the role of each amino acid in the interaction, five residues of the sites were mutated to alanine (W572, Y600, F608, R634, and Q686), and the CBMs were then subjected to AGE assays using known ligands for DdCBM8 (Fig. 6). As predicted from the crystallographic structure, mutations in amino acids that form the core of the binding site through CH–π interactions (W572A and Y600A) abolished DdCBM8 from binding to all polysaccharides evaluated here. The same profile would be expected for the mutation of W574 but, even after several attempts, we were not able to generate the specific mutant W574A. No protein mobility shift was observed from mutations F608A and, R634A, indicating that F608 and R634 probably does not interact with the ligand. Although R634 seems to be in a proper position for hydrogen bonding with the ligand, as indicated by the superposed structures in Figure 5C, the mobility shift effect was negligible. Finally, Q686A led to an intermediate reduction in ligand binding, confirming its role on the binding site. The amino acid sequence of DdCBM8 was aligned with representative members of the CBM8 family (Fig. S1). In general, the sequences showed great variability. However, the predicted residues that compose the binding site (W572, W574, Y600, and Q686) were highly conserved. The residues F608 and R634, which according to our data did not influence protein–carbohydrate interaction, were not conserved among CBM8 family members. Besides the amino acid residues involved in binding and the other conserved positions found in the alignment are buried in the protein structure and do not seem to play any role in CBM function. A second alignment (Fig. 7) performed with DdCBM8 and the two members described in CBM29 family (26Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Nurizzo D. Szabó L. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 23718-23726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) showed that the aromatic residues composing the binding site were conserved as expected. However, the CBM8 and CBM29 family members display low sequence identity and, therefore, it is difficult to infer any common ancestry. The CBM8 family has 109 members reported to date, of which 99 belong to bacteria and the other two belong to D. discoideum, which is a slime mold Amoeba considered as a nonmammalian biomedical and pharmacological model owing to its cellular structure, intracellular signaling, and host–pathogen interaction similarities with mammalian cells (28Martín-González J.

Biol. 2019; 63: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The first and unique report of this family is related to the description of an endo-β-1,4-glucanase from D. discoideum, named CelA (23Ramalingam R. Blume J.E. Ennis H.L. The Dictyostelium discoideum spore germination-specific cellulase is organized into functional domains.J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7834-7837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length CelA was able to bind to Avicel but not the cellulase domain itself or the cellulase with linker region (TETP repeat) (13Nagl M. Haske-Cornelius O. Skopek L. Bausch F. Pellis A. Bauer W. Nyanhongo G.S. Guebitz G.M. Mechanistic investigation of the effect of endoglucanases related to pulp refining.Cellulose. 2022; https://doi.org/10.1007/S10570-021-04386-5Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the C-terminal domain from CelA (described in this article as DdCBM8) was responsible for Avicel binding. Following the previous report (23Ramalingam R. Blume J.E. Ennis H.L. The Dictyostelium discoideum spore germination-specific cellulase is organized into functional domains.J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7834-7837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the pull-down assay confirmed the affinity of DdCBM8 for Avicel and showed that it was able to bind to BMCC as well. Since BMCC has a significantly higher proportion of crystalline than amorphous cellulose (∼95%), as compared with Avicel (∼60%) (30Hall M. Bansal P. Lee J.H. Realff M.J. Bommarius A.S. Cellulose crystallinity - a key predictor of the enzymatic hydrolysis rate.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), we can suppose that DdCBM8 has affinity for the crystalline portion indeed. However, the data indicate that this affinity is significantly lower than that observed for other type A CBMs (31Duan C.-J. Feng Y.-L. Cao Q.-L. Huang M.-Y. Feng J.-X.

The present study is the first structure of a CBM8 family reported to date. The crystallographic structure of DdCBM8 showed typical folding of the CBMs, but no similar structure was found in other families. Nevertheless, its binding site was inferred by structural comparison with members of the CBM29 family and further confirmed via mutagenesis of key amino acids. The planar binding site observed in the DdCBM8 structure would lead to its classification as a type A CBM. However, similar to CBM81, DdCBM8 is another exception to CBM-type canonical classification. It could be a type B with high affinity for soluble (single chain) polysaccharides or type A owing to the planar binding site of the protein. However, DdCBM8 lacks binding to oligosaccharides and has a low affinity for crystalline cellulose. The unique characteristics of DdCBM8, together with its broad specificity, may contribute to a better understanding of CBM function and its future biotechnological applications. The structure of DdCBM8 has no parallel in other CBM families, which has a planar binding site that would lead to its classification as a type A CBM. However, DdCBM8 lacks binding to oligosaccharides and has a low affinity for crystalline cellulose, which are functional properties of type A CBM. On the other hand, DdCBM8 presents type B functional characteristics because of the high affinity for soluble (single chain) polysaccharides. Therefore, the structural characteristics and broad specificity of DdCBM8 will drive discussions and revision about this canonical classification and promote advances on the current understanding of CBM interaction and classification. The gene encoding the CBM DdCBM8, found in an endoglucanase from D. discoideum (UniProt ID: P22699), was synthesized by GenOne Biotechnologies from nucleotides 1663 to 2115 (amino acids 555–705). The commercial vector containing the gene was digested with NdeI and NotI restriction enzymes and cloned into the expression bacterial vector pET28a(+). Cloning was verified using DNA sequencing.

However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in the initial phase and progressing phase of diabetic kidney disease remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted this study to find out what ROS and their modified product are associated with eGFR in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. A cross-sectional study was performed on 227 T2DM patients. The study subjects were divided into three groups based on their eGFR stage (Group 1, eGFR > 89 ml/min/1.73 m2; Group 2, eGFR = 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2; and Group 3, eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure serum oxLDL/β2GPI complex and urinary 8-iso-PGF2α, while ferrous ion oxidation xylenol orange method 1 (FOX-1) was used to measure urinary hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 significantly decreased across the groups, whereas OxLDL/β2GPI complex increased, but not significant, and there was no trend for 8-iso-PGF2α. Consistently, in the total study population, only H2O2 showed correlation with eGFR (r = 0.161, p = 0.015). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that significant factors for increased eGFR were H2O2, diastolic blood pressure, and female. Whereas increased systolic blood pressure and age were significant factors affecting the decrease of eGFR. We also found that urinary H2O2 had correlation with serum oxLDL/β2GPI complex in total population. This finding could lead to further research on urinary H2O2 for early detection and research on novel therapies of diabetic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W4225788860,"Although Africa is the most vulnerable region to climate change, little research has focused on how climate change is perceived by Africans. Using random forest methodology, we analyze survey and climate data from second-order political boundaries to explore what predicts climate change beliefs in Africa. We include five different dimensions of climate change beliefs: climate change awareness, belief in anthropogenic climate change, risk perception, the need to stop climate change, and self-efficacy. Based on these criteria we identify five key results: (1) climate change in Africa is largely perceived through its negative impacts on agriculture; (2) actual changes in local climate conditions are related to climate change beliefs; (3) authoritarian and intolerant ideologies are associated to less climate change awareness, and a diminished risk perception and belief that it must be stopped; (4) women are less likely to be aware of climate change, and (5) not speaking French, English or Portuguese is linked to a hindered understanding of climate beliefs. Our combined results can help policy makers better understand the need to jointly consider the multilevel complexities of individual beliefs and hydroclimatic data for the development of more accurate adaptation and mitigation strategies to combat the impacts of climate change in Africa."

When environmental contaminants affect these rhythms, the organism may experience fitness consequences such as reduced growth or increased susceptibility to pathogens. In their natural environment plants may be exposed to a wide range of industrial and agricultural soil pollutants. Here, we investigate how the addition of various metal salts to the root-interaction environment can impact rhythms, measured via the promoter:luciferase system. The consequences of these environmental changes were found to be varied and complex. Therefore, in addition to traditional Fourier-based analyses, we additionally apply novel wavelet-based spectral hypothesis testing and clustering methodologies to organize and understand the data. We are able to classify broad sets of responses to these metal salts, including those that increase, and those that decrease, the period, or which induce a lack of precision or disrupt any meaningful periodicity. Our methods are general, and may be applied to discover common responses and hidden structures within a wide range of biological time series data."
https://openalex.org/W4226053551,"An absolute or relative deficiency of pancreatic β-cells mass and functionality is a crucial pathological feature common to type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists have been the focus of considerable research attention for their ability to protect β-cell mass and augment insulin secretion with no risk of hypoglycemia. Presently commercially available GLP1R agonists are peptides that limit their use due to cost, stability, and mode of administration. To address this drawback, strategically designed distinct sets of small molecules were docked on GLP1R ectodomain and compared with previously known small molecule GLP1R agonists. One of the small molecule PK2 (6-((1-(4-nitrobenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl)-6H-indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline) displays stable binding with GLP1R ectodomain and induces GLP1R internalization and increasing cAMP levels. PK2 also increases insulin secretion in the INS-1 cells. The oral administration of PK2 protects against diabetes induced by multiple low-dose streptozotocin administration by lowering high blood glucose levels. Similar to GLP1R peptidic agonists, treatment of PK2 induces β-cell replication and attenuate β-cell apoptosis in STZ-treated mice. Mechanistically, this protection was associated with decreased thioredoxin-interacting protein expression, a potent inducer of diabetic β-cell apoptosis and dysfunction. Together, this report describes a small molecule, PK2, as an orally active nonpeptidic GLP1R agonist that has efficacy to preserve or restore functional β-cell mass."

In this study, we investigated the population genetic structure of the marbled rock crab, Pachygrapsus marmoratus along the coasts of Turkey. We genotyped 334 individuals from the Black Sea, the Turkish Straits System (TSS), the Aegean, and the Eastern Mediterranean basins. In order to reveal its evolutionary history and its population connectivity, we used mitochondrial CO1 region and five microsatellite loci. CO1 analyzes also included 610 additional samples from Genbank, which covered most of its distribution range. Both microsatellites and mtDNA showed decreased diversity in sampling sites of the TSS and the Black Sea as compared to those along the Aegean and the Levantine coasts. There is an especially strong geographical pattern in distributions of haplotypes in mtDNA, most probably as a result of genetic drift in the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara (SoM). Microsatellite data analyses revealed two genetically distinct clusters of P. marmoratus (clusters C and M). While individuals belonging to cluster C are present in all the sampling locations, those belonging to cluster M are only detected along the Mediterranean coasts including the Aegean and the Levantine basins. These clusters shared similar haplotypes in the Mediterranean. Haplotypes of two sympatric clusters could be similar due to incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms. In order to retrieve the complex demographic history and to investigate evolutionary processes resulting in sympatric clusters in the Aegean Sea and the Levantine basin, mitochondrial markers with faster mutation rates than CO1 and/or SNP data will be useful."

Of these, 408,470 unrelated individuals of European descent had a polygenic risk score (PRS) for CAD estimated.CAD Phenotypes.Association with baseline risk factors, mortality (n = 14,419 over 7.8 years median f/u), and a PRS for CAD.The algorithm classified individuals with CAD into prevalent MI (n = 4,900); incident MI (n = 4,621), prevalent CAD without MI (n = 10,910), incident CAD without MI (n = 8,668), prevalent self-reported MI (n = 2,754); prevalent self-reported CAD without MI (n = 5,623), yielding 37,476 individuals with any type of CAD. Risk factors were similar across the six CAD phenotypes, except for fewer men in the self-reported CAD without MI group (46.7% v 70.1% for the overall group). In age- and sex- adjusted survival analyses, mortality was highest following incident MI (HR 6.66, 95% CI 6.07-7.31) and lowest for prevalent self-reported CAD without MI at baseline (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.15-1.50) compared to disease-free controls. There were similar graded associations across the six phenotypes per SD increase in PRS, with the strongest association for prevalent MI (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.46-1.55) and the weakest for prevalent self-reported CAD without MI (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05-1.12).

https://openalex.org/W4226104911,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-mediated gene therapy is a promising new approach for treatment of cancer but shows limited anti-angiogenesis. VEGF-Trap plays a vital role in anti-angiogenesis. To enhance the anti-tumor effect of NDV, VEGF-Trap gene was incorporated into the genome of rNDV in this study (named rNDV-VEGF-Trap). Results showed that rNDV-VEGF-Trap reduced cell growth ratio by 85.37% and migration ratio by 87.9% in EA.hy926 cells. In vivo studies, rNDV-VEGF-Trap reduced tumor volume and weight of CT26-bearing mice by more than 3 folds. Immunohistochemistry analysis of CD34 showed rNDV-VEGF-Trap significantly decreased the number of vascular endothelial cells in the tumor tissues. Moreover, Western blot analysis demonstrated that treatment with rNDV-VEGF-Trap significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of AKT, ERK1/2 and STAT3 and increased the expression levels of P53, BAX and cleaved caspase-3 in the tumor tissue. In addition, to evaluate the toxicity of rNDV-VEGF-Trap, serum chemistries were analyzed. The results showed that rNDV-VEGF-Trap caused insignificant changes of creatinine levels, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase. Furthermore, administration of rNDV-VEGF-Trap did not cause the diarrhoea, decreased appetite, weight decrease and haemorrhage of the experimental mice. These data suggest that rNDV-VEGF-Trap exhibits an enhanced inhibition of CT26-bearing mice by enhancing anti-angiogenesis and apoptosis and may be a potential candidate for carcinoma therapy especially for colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4226183735,"Objective The objective of our study was to explore clinical decisions of psychiatrists regarding the management of common mental disorders in primary care (PC) in four Latin Americans countries, through the application of clinical vignettes. Methods Using a cross-sectional design, we conducted a self-administered online questionnaire survey of psychiatrists from Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba, and Chile. The questionnaire covered sociodemographic and professional information. The psychiatrists’ clinical decisions were assessed through three clinical vignettes representing typical PC cases of depression, anxiety, and somatization. Results 230 psychiatrists completed the online survey. Psychiatrists from Brazil were less likely to recognize depression as a mental disorder than those from Cuba (odds ratio (OR) = 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.10 to 0.91, p &lt; 0.04). Female gender (OR = 0.19, 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.91, p &lt; 0.02) and older age (OR = 0.92, 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.97, p &lt; 0.01) reduced the likelihood of agreement that depression cases should be treated by a Primary Care Physician (PCP). In the somatoform symptoms vignette, longer training duration increased the likelihood of agreement that treatment should be done by a psychiatrist instead of a PCP (OR = 1.19, 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.37, p &lt; 0.01). In the anxiety vignette, females (OR = 2.38, 95% CI, 1.10 to 5.13, p &lt; 0.01) and participants from Bolivia (compared with Cubans, OR = 4.19, 95% CI, 1.22 to 14.42, p &lt; 0.02) were more likely to consider that these patients should be treated by a psychiatrist instead of a PCP. Discussion Most psychiatrist respondents agreed that patients with depression should be treated by PCPs and that somatoform and anxiety cases should be treated by psychiatrists. These results show that psychiatrists consider that they, and not PCPs, should treat patients with common mental disorders, regardless of the evidence showing that common mental disorders can be treated by primary care physicians in PC."
https://openalex.org/W4226211298,"Architects should consider the aesthetic experience of potential users when designing architectures. Previous studies have shown that subjective aesthetic judgment of architectures is influenced by structure features, and Western observers prefer structures that have curvilinear contours, high ceilings, and open space. The building styles, however, vary across cultures, and it remains unclear whether the preference for contours, ceiling height, and openness exist across cultures. To investigate this issue, this study analyzes the aesthetic judgment of Chinese observers, and the results demonstrate that Chinese observers also prefer high ceilings and open space. Preference for curvilinear contours, however, interacts with ceiling height and openness. Simple effect analysis reveals that Chinese observers prefer curvilinear contours only when the ceiling is low and the space is closed. In sum, these results suggest that preference for high ceilings and open space is robust for Chinese observers, but the preference for curvilinear contours is less reliable."
https://openalex.org/W4226242485,"Existing lane-changing models generally neglect the detailed modeling of lane-changing actions and model lane-changing only as an instantaneous event. In this study, an intertunnel weaving section was taken as the background, the lane-changing duration and distance in the lane-changing process were taken as the main research objects. The detailed modeling of a lane-changing action was emphasized. Aerial videos of intertunnel weaving sections were collected, and accurate vehicle trajectory data were extracted. Basic data analysis shows that the lane-changing duration has a lognormal distribution and the lane-changing distance has a normal distribution. To analyze the difference of the lane-changing behavior characteristics in different lane-changing environments, based on the lead spacing and lag spacing in the target lane, a hierarchical clustering algorithm was applied to classify the lane-changing environment into six different types. Then, a deep neural network regression model was applied to model the lane-changing process for each environment type. The results show that the horizontal distribution, vertical distribution and statistical characteristics of the lane changing points under different lane-changing environments are significantly different. The prediction accuracy of the lane-changing distance after classification is improved by at least 61%, and the prediction accuracy of the lane-changing duration after classification is improved by at least 57%. It is also found that lane-changing behavior characteristics with large or small lag spacing are easier to predict, while in the other cases, the randomness of the lane-changing behavior characteristics is more obvious. The research results can be incorporated into lane-changing decision assistance systems and micro traffic simulation models to make the assistance system safer and more effective, and the simulation outputs should be more realistic and accurate."
https://openalex.org/W4221044096,"Extensive portions of the human genome have unknown function, including those derived from transposable elements. One such element, the DNA transposon Hsmar1, entered the primate lineage approximately 50 million years ago leaving behind terminal inverted repeat (TIR) sequences and a single intact copy of the Hsmar1 transposase, which retains its ancestral TIR-DNA-binding activity, and is fused with a lysine methyltransferase SET domain to constitute the chimeric SETMAR gene. Here, we provide a structural basis for recognition of TIRs by SETMAR and investigate the function of SETMAR through genome-wide approaches. As elucidated in our 2.37 Å crystal structure, SETMAR forms a dimeric complex with each DNA-binding domain bound specifically to TIR-DNA through the formation of 32 hydrogen bonds. We found that SETMAR recognizes primarily TIR sequences (∼5000 sites) within the human genome as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis. In two SETMAR KO cell lines, we identified 163 shared differentially expressed genes and 233 shared alternative splicing events. Among these genes are several pre-mRNA-splicing factors, transcription factors, and genes associated with neuronal function, and one alternatively spliced primate-specific gene, TMEM14B, which has been identified as a marker for neocortex expansion associated with brain evolution. Taken together, our results suggest a model in which SETMAR impacts differential expression and alternative splicing of genes associated with transcription and neuronal function, potentially through both its TIR-specific DNA-binding and lysine methyltransferase activities, consistent with a role for SETMAR in simian primate development."

Elucidating which factors underlie this variation can help us better understand how to improve health trajectories. Here we used a case:control study of refugee and non-refugee youth, differentially exposed to war-related trauma, to investigate the effects of genetics and psychosocial environment on response to trauma. We investigated genetic variants in two genes (serotonin transporter, 5-HTT, and catechol-O-methyltransferase, COMT) that have been implicated in response to trauma. We collected buccal samples and survey data from 417 Syrian refugee and 306 Jordanian non-refugee youth who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a mental health-focused intervention. Measures of lifetime trauma exposure, resilience, and six mental health and psychosocial stress outcomes were collected at three time points: baseline, ~13 weeks, and ~48 weeks. We used multilevel models to identify gene x environment (GxE) interactions and direct effects of the genetic variants in association with the six outcome measures over time. We did not identify any interactions with trauma exposure, but we did identify GxE interactions with both genes and resilience; 1) individuals with high expression (HE) variants of 5-HTTLPR and high levels of resilience had the lowest levels of perceived stress and 2) individuals homozygous for the Val variant of COMT with high levels of resilience showed stable levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms. We also identified a direct protective effect of 5-HTTLPR HE homozygotes on perceived insecurity. Our results point to novel interactions between the protective effects of genetic variants and resilience, lending support to ideas of differential susceptibility and altered stress reactivity in a cohort of war-affected adolescents."

Management recommendations involving covering or wrapping hives in insulation during winter have a long history; over 100 years ago, most recommendations for overwintering in cold climates involved heavy insulation wraps or moving hives indoors. These recommendations began to change in the mid-20th century, but hive covers are still considered useful and are described in contemporary beekeeping manuals and cooperative extension materials. However, most of the data supporting their use is published primarily in non-peer reviewed trade journals and was collected >40 years ago. In this time, the beekeeping environment has changed substantially, with new pressures from pathogens, agrochemicals, and land use changes. Here, we provide an update to the historical literature, reporting a randomized experiment testing the effectiveness of a common honey bee hive cover system across eight apiaries in central Illinois, USA, a temperate region dominated by conventional annual agriculture. We found that, when other recommended overwintering preparations are performed, covered colonies consumed less food stores and survived better than uncovered controls (22.5% higher survival). This study highlights the value of hive covers, even in an area not subject to extremely cold winter conditions, and these data can aid the production of evidence-based extension recommendations for beekeepers."
https://openalex.org/W4225984057,"Introduction Cognitive function is an important factor that affects functional recovery after hip fracture (HipFx) surgery. The literature on the pathophysiology of dementia in HipFx patients is scarce. We performed a differential diagnosis of dementia in HipFx patients using clinical and brain MRI findings. Methods This is a prospective study in which brain MRI was evaluated for patients with HipFx for research purposes. One-hundred-and-five HipFx patients (85 females and 20 males) who underwent surgery and were subsequently able to undergo brain MRI at our hospital were evaluated. The mean age was 84 years. The presence of dementia was determined based on clinical findings and whether the patient meets its diagnostic criteria according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Edition (ICD-10). The differential diagnosis of dementia was made based on brain MRI findings and the dementia diagnostic flow chart published in the Clinical Practice Guideline for Dementia 2017 (Japanese Society of Neurology). The Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimer’s Disease (VSRAD) advance 2 diagnostic software was used to evaluate atrophy of the para-hippocampal gyrus. Results Fifty-six (53%) patients were clinically diagnosed with dementia according to the ICD-10 criteria. The MRI findings were diverse: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-type, asymptomatic multiple ischemic cerebral lesions, past symptomatic cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage, Binswanger’s disease (BW)-type, chronic subdural hematoma, disproportionately enlarged subarachnoidal hydrocephalus (DESH), and their combinations thereof. A combination of MRI and clinical findings of dementia patients demonstrated the following distribution of dementia subtypes: AD (n = 20), vascular dementia (n = 33), AD and BW vascular dementia (n = 3). Conclusion This study revealed that the brain MRI findings of HipFx patients were diverse. Although vascular dementia is found to be common in this particular population, this could be an incidental finding. Further study is warranted to clarify the specificity of our findings by increasing the number of patients, setting the control, and investigating whether dementia subtypes affect postoperative gait acquisition and fall risk."

This was especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, and minority communities were particularly affected. The University of California San Francisco and Health, Equity, Action, Leadership Initiative jointly sent volunteer teams of nurses and doctors to work in the Navajo Nation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This presented an opportunity to explore how academic medical centers (AMCs) could effectively partner with vulnerable communities to provide support during healthcare crises. Therefore, the aims of this study were to describe volunteers' perspectives of academic-community partnerships by exploring their personal, professional and societal insights and lessons learned based on their time in the Navajo Nation during COVID-19.We recruited key informants using purposeful sampling of physicians and nurses who volunteered to go to the Navajo Nation during the spring 2020 COVID-19 surge, as well as hospital administrators and leaders involved in organizing the COVID-19 efforts. We used in-depth qualitative interviews to explore key informants' experiences pre-departure, during their stay, and after their return, as well as perspectives of the partnership between an AMC and the Navajo Nation. We used thematic analysis to systematically identify, analyze and report patterns (themes) within the data.In total, 37 clinicians and hospital administrators were interviewed including 14 physicians, 16 nurses, and 7 health system leaders. Overall, we found 4 main themes each with several subthemes that defined the partnership between the AMC and the Navajo Nation. Mission and values incorporated civic duty, community engagement, leadership commitment and employee dedication. Solidarity, trust and humility encompassed pre-existing trust, workforce sustainability, humility and erasure of 'savior narratives.' Coordination included logistical coordination, flexibility, selectivity of who and what traveled to the response and coordination around media response. Workforce preparation and support encompassed understanding of historical context and providing healthcare in limited settings, dangers of inadequate preparation and the need for emotional support.This study provides guidelines which AMCs might use to develop and improve partnerships they have or would like to develop with vulnerable communities. These guidelines may even be broadly applied to partnerships outside of a pandemic response. Importantly, such partnerships need to be built with trust and with an eye towards sustainability and long-term relationships as opposed to 'medical missions'."
https://openalex.org/W4226050809,"When dealing with longitudinal data, linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) are often used by researchers. However, LMMs are not always the most adequate models, especially if we expect a nonlinear relationship between the outcome and a continuous covariate. To allow for more flexibility, we propose the use of a semiparametric mixed-effects model to evaluate the overall treatment effect on the hemodynamic responses during bone graft healing and build a prediction model for the healing process. The model relies on a closed-form expectation–maximization algorithm, where the unknown nonlinear function is estimated using a Lasso-type procedure. Using this model, we were able to estimate the effect of time for individual mice in each group in a nonparametric fashion and the effect of the treatment while accounting for correlation between observations due to the repeated measurements. The treatment effect was found to be statistically significant, with the autograft group having higher total hemoglobin concentration than the allograft group."

This study tests the hypothesis that the observed variation in efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates can be explained by the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic at trial sites. To test the proposed hypothesis, we conducted a systematic search following PRISMA guidelines. Our search resulted in 8 vaccine candidates that had reported efficacy data from a total of 20 Phase 3 trials, representing a total of 221,968 subjects, 453 infections across the vaccinated groups and 1,554 infections across the placebo groups. We use meta-regression models to analyse the potential associations between prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic at trial sites and efficacy of the reported SARS-CoV2 vaccines. The overall estimate of the risk-ratio is 0.24 (95% CI, 0.17–0.34, p ≤ 0.01), with a high degree of heterogeneity (τ 2 = 0.50, I 2 = 88.73%). Our meta-regression analysis with pandemic prevalence as the predictor explains almost half the variance in risk ratios across trials (R 2 = 49.06%, p ≤ 0.01). This study finds that efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines reported in Phase 3 trial declines as pandemic prevalence at trial sites increases. Trials conducted in locations with low pandemic prevalence reported higher efficacies as compared to trials conducted in high pandemic prevalence locations."
https://openalex.org/W4226315206,"Spatial event data is heavily used in contemporary research on political violence. Such data are oftentimes mapped onto grid-cells or administrative regions to draw inference about the determinants of conflict intensity. This setup can identify geographic determinants of violence, but is also prone to methodological issues. Problems resulting from spatial aggregation and dependence have been raised in methodological studies, but are rarely accounted for in applied research. As a consequence, we know little about the empirical relevance of these general problems and the trustworthiness of a popular research design. We address these questions by simulating conflict events based on spatial covariates from seven high-profile conflicts. We find that standard designs fail to deliver reliable inference even under ideal conditions at alarming rates. We also test a set of statistical remedies which strongly improve the results: Controlling for the geographic area of spatial units eliminates an important source of spurious correlation. In time-series analyses, the same result can be achieved with unit-level fixed effects. Under outcome diffusion, spatial lag models with area controls produce most reliable inference. When those are computationally intractable, geographically larger aggregations lead to similar improvements. Generally, all analyses should be performed at two separate levels of geographic aggregation. To facilitate future research into geographic methods, we release the Simple Conflict Event Generator (SCEG) developed for this analysis."

A likely causal agent of deterioration at Pueblo Bonito was the inability of Ancestral Puebloan engineers to manage the impacts from the annual precipitation, presently measured at about 220 mm. A resulting time-dependent event was rot to wetted roof and ceiling timbers, lintels, and wall support beams which required decades of incubation by wood decay fungi to reduce wood tensile strength to levels leading to roof and wall collapse. Important time- independent events that could occur any time after construction include water action on the mud mortar which resulted in unstable gravity load paths in stone walls, ponding of water in walls which when frozen would lead to the blowout of wall segments, and the occasional flood that disrupted foundations. Pueblo Bonito may have been an occupation site for centuries but the lifetime of individually constructed rooms may have only been decades, resulting in several build- repair- or abandon cycles being part of the history of that Great House."
