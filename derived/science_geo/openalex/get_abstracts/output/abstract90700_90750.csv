https://openalex.org/W2058809000,"Two cloned lambda 1-producing myelomas (HOPC-1, MOPC-104E) contain rearranged kappa genes and levels of mature-sized kappa RNA comparable to those found in kappa-producing myeloma cells. Another lambda 1-producing myeloma tumor line (HOPC-2020) and a lambda 1-containing B cell leukemia line (BCL1) also contain significant levels of kappa RNA. One lambda 11-producing line (MOPC-315) contains no detectable kappa RNA, but it also has no kappa genes in the embryonic configuration. kappa-related proteins are not detectable in the lambda 1-producing lines by standard procedures, but by sensitive methods at least two lines contain kappa protein fragments. The MOPC-104E line produces both a 14.5K kappa fragment that is not readily detectable because of its low rate of synthesis and short half-life (T 1/2 less than 5 min), and a major 16.5K protein that lacks kappa cross reactivity but is demonstrable by translation of purified MOPC-104E kappa RNA. The HOPC-1 kappa RNA also encodes a short-lived 14K kappa fragment. The MPC-11 line, which produces a mature kappa RNA and protein as well as an 800 base kappa fragment RNA and kappa protein fragment, has both kappa alleles rearranged, one apparently aberrantly between J and C kappa. Two different kappa RNA species, one the same size as the MPC-11 kappa fragment RNA, frequently are present in kappa RNA-containing Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed lymphoid cells as well as in 18 and 19 day murine fetal liver. For light chains, neither allelic nor isotype exclusion is generally evident in myeloma and lymphoma cells; rather both produce only a single functional light chain. Models of light chain activation must explain restriction by considering the functional properties of the light chain rather than light chain gene expression."

The labeling procedure is mild, requiring only brief exposure to formaldehyde (10 to 12 mM) and tritiated sodium borohydride (3 to 5 mM), and specific for the alpha amino groups of NH2-terminal residues and epsilon-amino groups of lysyl residues. The extent of modification for each protein ranged between 5 and 16% at available amino groups based on a stoichiometric reactivity of 2 mol of formaldehyde/mol of primary amine. Although the degree of substitution required to obtain these specific activities was high, no significant loss of antigenic or biological activities was apparent. Each labeled protein was 90 to 95% precipitable with antiserum elicited to the unreacted protein. The hemolytic activity of C3 was reduced by only 16%; the oxygen affinity of HbA2 was minimally decreased, and the phosphorylcholine binding affinity of an IgA myeloma protein (TEPC-15) was not significantly affected. Precise double antibody radioimmunoassays were developed with each tritiated protein capable of detecting less than 10(-8) g of antigen. Labeled protein samples have been stored for time periods up to 1 year without appreciable deterioration."
https://openalex.org/W1555283812,"It has been previously reported (Lotscher, H. R., Winterhalter, K. H., Carafoli, E., and Richter, C. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 4340-4344) that in Ca2+-loaded mitochondria hydroperoxides induce a release of Ca2+ from mitochondria and an irreversible oxidation of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides. Here we show that in the presence of Ca2+ oxidized mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides are hydrolyzed inside mitochondria and that nicotinamide is released from mitochondria. The extent of the hydrolysis of NAD(P)+ is dependent on the amount of both hydroperoxide and Ca2+. The hydrolysis is reversible in the presence of added nicotinamide. The release of Ca2+ from mitochondria is electroneutral, and is directly or indirectly dependent on oxidized mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides. By contrast, the uptake of Ca2+ most probably does not require the present of reduced pyridine nucleotides. Control experiments show that even under the most drastic conditions employed in this study (100 nmol of Ca2+ and 85 nmol of t-butylhydroperoxide/mg of protein) mitochondria retain a considerable degree of functional integrity."

https://openalex.org/W2023459480,"The structural gene for a testis-specific β-tubulin subunit in Drosophila melanogaster was mapped genetically and cytogenetically by means of a dominant male sterile mutation, B2tD, in which a variant form of the testis β-tubulin is expressed. The B2t locus is at 48.5 map units on the third chromosome genetic map, and in bands 85D4–7 on the salivary chromosome map. The mutation B2tD causes disruption of microtubule function in all stages of spermatogenesis, beginning with meiosis. The effects of gene dosage of B2tD on meiosis were examined in detail cytologically at the light microscope level. In testes of flies in which the variant tubulin subunit is expressed, abnormal meiotic spindle formation, improper chromosome movement and failure to undergo cytokinesis occur. The extent of these defects in microtubule function depends on the dosage of the B2tD mutation, being most severe in males homozygous for the mutation, intermediate in males heterozygous for the mutation, and least marked in males heterozygous for B2tD and a tandem duplication of the region of the genome containing the B2t locus. Chromosomal events unrelated to microtubule function, such as replication and condensation, occur normally. Results obtained during mapping of the B2t locus strongly suggest a haplo-insufficient site at or closely linked to this locus."

We have found that AChR clusters on the ventral myotubes surfaces are always located within broad regions of close cell-substrate contact. Detailed analysis of the fine structure of the AChR cluster and its associated contact region showed that AChRs within a cluster are concentrated between the points of closest cell-substrate apposition. Vinculin, a recently discovered intracellular smooth muscle protein, is also concentrated in broad regions of close contact, interdigitating with AChRs within the clusters."

Busch (1974) in The Cell Nucleus, Vol. 3, pp 151-208; Academic Press, New York) are now of interest because of their suggested role in processing of heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (Lerner, M.R., Boyle, J.A., Mount, S.M., Wolin, S.L., and Steitz, J.A. (1980) Nature, 283, 220-224). A previously uncharacterized RNA, U6 (4.7 S) nuclear RNA, which is 106 nucleotides long, was extracted from Novikoff hepatoma ascites cell nuclei and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The primary nucleitde sequence of U6 RNA was determined by subjecting the RNA to several types of enzymatic digestions and gel-sequencing techniques. The sequence is: (formula: see text). U6 RNA contains three pseudouridylic acid residues, four alkali-stable dinucleotides, two alkali-stable trinucleotides, one m6adenosine, and one m2guanosine and is notable for the high concentration of modified nucleotides in the center of the molecule. U6 RNA has an unusual 5' terminus which has not yet been fully characterized."

https://openalex.org/W86200162,"Adipose tissue from fed rats rapidly degrades [l14C]leucine to 14C02. This process is stimulated by glucose (but not by pyruvate) and by insulin, which also enhances the degradation of isoleucine and valine. Fasting and protein deficiency markedly reduced the catabolism of [l-‘4C]leucine in epididymal fat pads by decreasing the decarboxylation of a-ketoisocaproic acid and the transamination of leucine. In tissue homogenates, the rates of these reactions decreased by 63 and 47%, respectively, after 2 days of food deprivation. Within only 1 day of food deprivation, total decarboxylation of leucine in tissue homogenates was 73% slower. In adipose tissue from the fasted animals, leutine oxidation was also stimulated by glucose but not by insulin. In fat pads from fed (but not fasted) rats, leucine decreased the oxidation of pyruvate and thus may spare use of glucose-derived acetyl coenzyme A for lipogenesis. When fed and fasted rats were injected with [1-14CJleucine, their rates of expiration of 14C02 did not differ, but when they were injected with p-‘4C]leucine, 14C02 expiration was greater in the fasted rats. Therefore, food deprivation did not affect the total amount of leucine degradation by the organism but seemed to increase the oxidation of leucine by muscle, while decreasing its conversion to triglycerides. The incubated fat pads appear to synthesize and release large amounts of glutamine and smaller quantities of alanine and glutamate. Addition of leucine increased release into the medium of glutamine and, to a lesser extent, that of alanine and glutamate (without affecting tissue protein balance or the release of other amino acids). In fasting, when degradation of leucine fell, the accumulation of glutamine and alanine in the medium decreased. Isoleucine and valine were degraded more slowly than leucine and stimulated glutamine and alanine release to a lesser extent. In adipose tissue, as in muscle, production of glutamine, as well as alanine and glutamate, seems to be the route for disposal of amino groups released in the transamination of branched-chain amino acids."

Glibenclamid treatment was associated with a marked depletion of the insulin content of B cells and with an increase in the number and size of gap junctions between these cells. A significance correlation was found between these two events."
https://openalex.org/W2020625803,Long-term administration of either superactive analog's of gonadotropin-releasing hormone or of testosterone suppresses gonadotropin secretion in male animals and humans. Testosterone administered in combination with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog further suppresses serum gonadotropin levels in male rats. This observation indicates synergistic activity and suggests that the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog and testosterone act at independent sites within the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The primary actions of superactive analog are probably mediated by changes at a postreceptor site in the pituitary gonadotropin-secreting cells.

https://openalex.org/W1559030713,"Polyadenylated RNA prepared from pituitary glands of normal and castrate rats was translated in membrane-free heterologous cell-free systems derived from wheat germ and rabbit reticulocytes. Sodium dodecyl sufate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography demonstrated a major [35S]methionine-labeled translation product of castrate pituitary mRNA with apparent Mr = 14,000. This Mr = 14,000 product was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-sera to the alpha subunit of rat and bovine luteinizing hormone (LH alpha) and was much reduced in the translation products of normal pituitary RNA. Additional minor translation products of normal pituitary RNA. Additional minor translation products with apparent Mr = 15,000 and 16,000 were identified by immunoprecipitation with antisera to rat LH beta and to the beta subunit of rat follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH beta), respectively. The immunological identity of the alpha, LH beta, and FSH beta precursors was confirmed by successful competition of these immunoprecipitation reactions by unlabeled homologous LH alpha, LH beta, and FSH, respectively. These results indicate that the gonadotropin subunits are synthesized as precursors from separate mRNAs. This system is responsive to endocrine manipulations and is appropriate for studies of the regulation of gonadotropin biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1526430755,"Rats were given large parenteral loads of fructose and the different segments of single nephrons then analyzed for fructose metabolites, fructose metabolizing enzymes, and nucleotide high energy phosphates. Fructokinase and fructose-1-P aldolase activities, and all the major metabolite and nucleotide effects, were confined to the proximal tubule. The proximal straight segment had the highest fructokinase and suffered the greatest changes. In this segment, fructose-1-P rose to 60 mmol/kg (dry weight basis) and glycerol-3-P and glucose-6-P reached 8 and 12 mmol/kg, respectively. ATP fell 80% and GTP (judging from the changes in GTP plus GDP) fell by the same percentage, but UTP was less affected. Total adenylate decreased 50%. In the proximal convoluted tubule, where fructokinase was lower and fructose-1-P aldolase higher than in the straight segment, fructose-1-P rose ony one-fourth as much and glucose-6-P was almost unchanged. In contrast, glycerol-3-P rose more, reaching 16 mmol/kg. Other substances measured along the nephron were glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, fructose, glucose, fructose bisphosphate, triose phosphate, and 6-P-gluconate. Control ATP levels were found to be highest in the distal tubule."
https://openalex.org/W1523321921,"Antisera have been prepared against purified proteoglycan monomer and link protein from bovine cartilages. The immunological properties of these species have been studied by immunodiffusion, Laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis, crossed immunoelectrophoresis, hemagglutination, and immunofluorescence. Antisera raised against either adult bovine articular or foetal bovine epiphyseal proteoglycan monomer were monospecific. They did not react with link protein, type II collagen, nor with any other molecular species isolated from bovine articular and epiphyseal cartilages. Antisera to link protein, purified from bovine nasal cartilage by dissociative density gradient centrifugation followed by chromatography under dissociative conditions on Sephacryl S-200, showed no reaction with proteoglycan monomer by immunodiffusion. However, antisera to link protein showed a weak reaction with native monomer on Laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis (not detectable when chondroitinase ABC-treated monomer was used), and with chondroitinase ABC-treated monomer by hemagglutination assay. These traces of antibody to proteoglycan monomer were inactivated by immunoreaction with proteoglycan monomer in solution to provide a monospecific antiserum to link protein. Purified antibodies specific for proteoglycan monomer, some of which did not react with the hyaluronic acid binding region of bovine nasal monomer, were prepared from anti-link sera by affinity chromatography using chondroitinase ABC-treated bovine nasal proteoglycan monomer. Purified link protein, which contains 48,000- and 44,000-dalton subunits, contains two immunologically distinguishable species. An immunoassay for purified link protein was developed using Laurell rocket electrophoresis. A micro-method, using crossed-immunoelectrophoresis, for studying the binding of link protein to proteoglycan monomer and to hyaluronate is described. The complex of link protein bound to hyaluronate was dissociated on reaction of link protein with antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2339994291,"The importance of threonine in the Asn-X-Thr recognition sequence for asparagine-linked glycosylation was tested by examining the effect of a threonine analog, beta-hydroxynorvaline, on co-translational glycosylation in Krebs' II ascites tumor lysates. beta-Hydroxynorvaline inhibited the glycosylation of the alpha subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin and the beta subunit of bovine luteinizing hormone; both proteins contain Asn-X-Thr recognition sites. The effect was prevented by threonine, indicating that beta-hydroxynorvaline acted via its incorporation into protein. These results provide direct evidence for the role of threonine in Asn-X-Thr sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation. The results support the view that this site is sensitive to steric hindrance."
https://openalex.org/W1550086077,"Tubulin and the two microtubule-associated proteins MAP2 and tau were purified from pig brain. The ability of MAP2 and tau to induce tubulin polymerization in the presence of guanyl-5'-yl methylene diphosphonate was compared in parallel experiments. MAP2 at 0.2 mol/mol of tubulin induced the polymerization of tubulin exclusively into ribbons 0.45 +/- 0.05 micrometer long with an average of six protofilaments. At the same molar ratio, tau promoted the polymerizaton of tubulin exclusively into microtubules. These results strongly suggest that MAP2 and tau are functionally different proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1511234798,"The methylation of brain peptides was investigated by incubating brain high speed supernatant fractions with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine and resolving the radioactive peptide products by polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Peptides of 17,000, 21,000, 29,000, and 34,000 daltons were methylated in vitro; the 17,000-dalton peptide had the same electrophoretic mobility as authentic calmodulin and showed the shift in electrophoretic mobility in the presence of EGTA which is characteristic of calmodulin. The identification of the 17,000-dalton peptide as calmodulin was confirmed by electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions and by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing electrophoresis. The enzyme responsible for calmodulin methylation and its substrate, the putative desmethylcalmodulin, were separated from one another by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. When this partially purified enzyme was incubated with the substrate-containing fraction, calmodulin was the only methylated product. A test tube assay for calmodulin N-methyltransferase was developed and validated by comparison with calmodulin methylation assessed by gel electrophoresis. Both procedures showed that calmodulin methyltransferase is inhibited by EGTA and stimulated by divalent cations, with manganese giving the highest activity. Similar values for ph optimum and kinetic constants were obtained when the electrophoresis and test tube assays were compared. A rapid chromatographic procedure for the separation of methylated lysines and arginines was developed and used to demonstrate that epsilon-trimethyllysine is the radioactive amino acid formed when calmodulin is methylated in vitro. The methyltransferse, which is distinguished from previously described methylase III enzymes by its divalent cation requirement and substrate specificity, is thus designated as S-adenosyl-L-methionine calmodulin lysine methyltransfease."

https://openalex.org/W1512586659,"Three major glycoproteins of calf thyroid plasma membranes were preferentially solubilized by chloroform/methanol extraction and recovered along with glycolipids in the aqueous phase. After removal of lipid from this extract, a fraction was obtained which accounted for about 20% of the carbohydrate of the membrane but only 2% of its peptide weight. Partial resolution of the components could be achieved by filtration on Bio-Gel A-5m, while preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resulted in the isolation in homogeneous form of approximately equal amounts of the three glycoproteins which were designated as GP-1, GP-2, and GP-3, in order of their increasing mobility. These purified glycoproteins appeared on electrophoresis as single components by periodic acid-Schiff staining as well as by distribution of radioactivity following 3H or 14C labeling. Molecular weights of 100,000, 59,000, and 20,000 were estimated for the three components on the basis of their retardation coefficients. The total carbohydrate content by weight determined for GP-1, GP-2, and GP-3 was 56, 57, and 79%, respectively. The sugar constituents were mannose, galactose, fucose, glucosamine, galactosamine, and sialic acid, which were present in the following mol per cents: GP-1, 13:32:5:24:13:12; GP-2, 20:28:3:32:5:11; GP-3, 12:36:2:34:6:10. Studies performed with various lectins (Bandeiraea simplicifolia I and I (B4), wheat germ, Ricinus communis, and soybean) on the gycoproteins, either native or after treatment with glycosidases (alpha- or beta-galactosidase, neuraminidase), indicated that sialic acid and alpha-linked galactose were in terminal positions, beta-galactosyl residues were internally located, and chains containing the sequence sialic acid-N-acetylgalactosamine were present."
https://openalex.org/W2297713857,"Activity of hepatic adenylate cyclase is significantly influenced by membrane-bound nucleotide pyrophosphatase and by components of ATP-regenerating systems. Nucleotide pyrophosphatase, which hydrolyzes ATP, GTP, and guanyl-5’-yl imidodiphosphate (GPP(NH)P) between the a- and P-phosphates, can affect measured activity by hydrolyzing substrate or modulator, and by facilitating formation of adenosine. This influence was reduced by the preparation of plasma membranes in or their pretreatment with EDTA and dithiothreitol. CAMP formation was linear for a longer time, and ATP regeneration improved while pyrophosphatase activity was reduced. In addition, the measurement of optimal cyclase activity required the inclusion in the reaction mixture of myokinase, to permit rephosphorylation of 5’-AMP, and adenosine deaminase to remove inhibitory levels of adenosine. The nature and magnitude of the effects of myokinase and adenosine deminase could account for much of the effect of a liver cytosol preparation to stimulate the hepatic adenylate cyclase. This suggests that reported effects of cytosol on cyclase activity may be due in part to the influence of these two enzymes. Phosphoenolpyruvate inhibited basal and fluoridestimulated adenylate cyclase activities in a manner that appeared competitive with metal-ATP, but enhanced guanine nucleotide-dependent activities in a free metaldependent manner. However, this enhancement was not seen when membranes were pretreated with EDTA and when cyclase activity was determined in the presence of myokinase and adenosine deaminase. In addition, phosphoenolpyruvate reduced nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity, and the data suggested that the enhancing effect might be due to"

Effective lipid . protein complex formation was found to occur at the onset temperature for melting of the gel state, and equal incorporation of both lipid components of the binary mixture was observed. Two sizes of products were obtained, one containing 2 A-I molecules per complex and the other containing 3; the proportions of these two products depended upon the initial phospholipid/protein ratio employed. these two product species were found to be resolvable by density gradient centrifugation as well as gel filtration, reflecting substantial differences in composition as well as size. The ratio of DMPC to DPPC or DSPC was the same in the isolated complexes as in the initial mixture, suggesting that th protein does not associate preferentially with the fluid phase lipid, but with lipid domains in which the components are randomly distributed. Electron microscopy of recombinant particles containing a 2:1 ratio (w/w) of DSPC to DMPC revealed stacks of discs whose thickness was proportionately greater than for discs containing DMPC alone. Also of significance was the finding that recombinant discs containing 3 A-I molecules possessed a diameter approximately 1.5 times larger than recombinant discs containing 2 A-I molecules. These data are consistent with the model for the recombinant particles described by Tall et al. (Tall, A.R., Small, D.M., Deckelbau, R.J., and Shipley, G.G. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252; 4701-4711), in which the phospholipid is found as a circular bilayer, the thickness of which is dependent upon the length of the acyl chain, and around which the protein is distributed as an annulus."
https://openalex.org/W1561813001,"Pulse labeling of cells of Bacillus megaterium followed by cell disruption and immunoprecipitation has shown that the spore-specific Proteins A and C are synthetized only during a discrete time period in sporulation. At its maximum, the synthesis of the A- and C-proteins accounted for 5% of the protein being synthesized in vivo, but the mRNA for the A- and C-proteins had a lifetime no longer than that of other mRNAs translated at that time. No evidence was found for synthesis of Proteins A or C in high molecular weight precursor form, and essentially all of the newly synthesized A- and C-protein was found in the forespore. Isolation of total RNA from cells in various stages of growth and sporulation, translation of this RNA in a cell-free system from vegetative cells, and immunoprecipitation showed that the ability of cellular RNA to promote A- and C-protein synthesis in vitro was directly proportional to the rate at which the cells had been synthesizing Proteins A and C in vivo. These data indicate that synthesis of Proteins A and C during sporulation in B. megaterium is primarily under transcriptional control. The identity of the immunoprecipitated labeled material material synthesized in vitro with the A- and C-proteins was established by: 1) their co-migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels; 2) co-migration on high performance liquid chromatography of tryptic peptides from an [35S]methionine-labeled immunoprecipitate with the methionine-containing tryptic peptides of the A- and C-proteins; and 3) digestion of the labeled immunoprecipitate with a protease specific for the A- and C-proteins."

The apparent Ki for inhibition of brain adenylate cyclase by 2',3'-dialATP was 196 microM in the presence of Mg2+ and 37 microM in the presence of Mn2+. The Ki values for inhibition of rat liver adenylate cyclase by 2',3'-dialATP were 48 and 30 microM in the presence of Mg2+; and Mn2+, respectively. Adenylate cyclase activity was irreversibly inactivated by 2'3'-dialATP in the presence of NaCNBH3 and the kinetics for loss in enzyme activity were pseudo-first order. Both ATP and Tris protected adenylate cyclase from irreversible inhibition by 2',3'-dialATP and NaCNBH3. It is proposed that 2',3'-dialATP forms a Schiff's base with an amino group at the active site of the enzyme and that Na-CNBH3 reduction of this Schiff's base causes irreversible modification of the catalytic subunit. The Km for 2',3'-dialATP inactivation, the maximal rate constant of inactivation, and protection of the enzyme by ATP were not affected by the presence or absence of free Mg2+. These data indicate that a divalent cation is not required for binding of 2',3'-dialATP to the active site of adenylate cyclase."

The radioactivity incorporated into the Forssman glycolipid using a mixture of Hex3Cer and globoside (GalNAc-beta-Gal-Gal-Glc-Cer) as the substrates was greater than that from each substrate singly. When the radioactive Forssman glycolipid from the mixed substrates was hydrolyzed with alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, the ratio of 14C-labeled globoside to the liberated N-acetyl[14C]galactosamine was 0.38, indicating that Hex3Cer could serve as a substrate. From these results, the following hypothesis (baton pass model) is proposed. There exists an enzyme complex consisting of beta- and alpha-transferases in membranes. In this complex, it is not possible to saturate alpha-transferase with exogenous globoside; however, it can utilize a transient globoside synthesized from Hex3Cer. It thus appears that Forssman glycolipid is in part formed from Hex3Cer through this enzyme complex without the accumulation of the intermediate globoside. The abbreviations used are: GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; Cer, ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1661259943,"When beta-glucosidase from sweet almonds reacts with p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside at subzero temperatures, a rapid release of p-nitrophenol, stoichiometric with enzyme concentration, occurs prior to turnover. This observation is interpreted as reflecting rapid formation of a glucose-enzyme intermediate, followed by rate-limiting breakdown. The energies of activation for the formation and breakdown of the intermediate were 6.0 +/- 2 and 19.0 +/- 2 kcal mol-1, respectively. Extrapolation of the reaction rates to higher temperatures suggests an isokinetic temperature circa 24 degrees C. Measurement of kcat in aqueous solution as a function of temperature yields a breakpoint in the Arrhenius plot at 20 degrees C and activation energies above and below this point which correspond to the values at subzero temperatures (6.7 and 17.0 kcal mol-1, respectively). This breakpoint thus reflects a change in the rate-determining step from formation of the intermediate at higher temperatures to breakdown at lower values, and explains why a burst of p-nitrophenol is observed at low, but not high, temperatures with this substrate. The significance of this finding to other glycohydrolases, and enzyme catalysis in general, is considered."

At NADPH concentrations of 1.0 mM, half-times for inactivation are 7 to 9 min and reflect processing of 800 molecules of NADPH/enzyme molecule before an inactivation event occurs. Addition of saturating amounts of N,N-dimethylaniline leads to a 3-fold increase of Vmax of NADPH utilization with 40% of these extra molecules providing electrons for the hydroxylation/N-demethylation sequence. About 2300 turnovers occur over the time period of inactivation, with about 425 product formaldehyde molecules being generated in this interval. This inactivation does not occur in intact microsomes from the livers of phenobarbital-treated rats; however, solubilization of the microsomes or addition of exogenous pure reductase renders the P-450 susceptible to the same autoinactivation."
