https://openalex.org/W86676327,"With the recent observations by Dubnoff (1) and Muntz (2) that choline oxidase is necessary for transmethylation reactions from choline, the choline oxidase system appears to be an important link in animal metabolism. In other work the animal choline oxidase activity has been shown to be influenced strongly by dietary folic acid (3) and aminopterin (4), though not when they are added to the enzyme in vitro (5). Since vitamin Blz appears to be related to methyl group utilization as demonstrated by Schaefer et al. (6), it is possible that this vitamin is also related to the choline oxidase system. Although some studies have been made on the choline oxidase system, no general method for assaying activity of this enzyme in whole liver homogenates has been devised. In the present paper we wish to present some additional studies made in order to obtain a general assay method for the choline oxidase system in rat liver. With this method the effects of various nutritional factors on methyl-group transfer can be studied."
