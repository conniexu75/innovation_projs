Extensions to higher multiple moments, such as quadrupole and octupole, are even trickier. Benalcazar et al. built a theoretical framework for dealing with these moments in certain types of solids. In the presence of some crystalline symmetries, the quadrupole moment is quantized, and the corners of the system play host to fractionally charged, topologically protected states. These predictions may be testable in cold atom and photonic systems. Science , this issue p. 61"

Avni et al. used the Hi-C method of genome confirmation capture to assemble and annotate the wild allotetraploid wheat ( Triticum turgidum ). They then identified the putative causal mutations in genes controlling shattering (a key domestication trait among cereal crops). They also performed an exome capture–based analysis of domestication among wild and domesticated genotypes of emmer wheat. The findings present a compelling overview of the emmer wheat genome and its usefulness in an agricultural context for understanding traits in modern bread wheat. Science , this issue p. 93"

The prevailing model in oncology is that lymph node metastases give rise to distant metastases. This “sequential progression model” is the rationale for surgical removal of tumor-draining lymph nodes. Naxerova et al. used phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the evolutionary relationship of primary tumors, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases in 17 patients with colorectal cancer (see the Perspective by Markowitz). The sequential progression model applied to only one-third of the patients. In the other two-thirds, distant metastases and lymph node metastases originated from independent subclones within the primary tumor. Science , this issue p. 55 ; see also p. 35"

Remarkably, severed axons morphologically preserved by axon death pathway mutations remain integrated in circuits and able to elicit complex behaviors after stimulation, indicating that blockade of axon death signaling results in long-term functional preservation of axons. Maintenance of the morphological integrity of neurons is essential for sustained nervous system function throughout an animal’s lifespan. Nervous system injury or neurological disease leads to axonal and synaptic degeneration and, in turn, loss of neural circuit connectivity and function (Conforti et al., 2014Conforti L. Gilley J. Coleman M.P. Wallerian degeneration: an emerging axon death pathway linking injury and disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 394-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Molecular pathways driving axonal degeneration remain poorly defined in any context; however, recent work on Wallerian degeneration (WD) has revealed that axon injury activates an intrinsic, conserved, pro-degenerative (axon death) signaling pathway. We previously identified dSarm/Sarm1 (sterile α/Armadillo/Toll-Interleukin receptor homology domain protein) as a key mediator of axon death signaling (Osterloh et al., 2012Osterloh J.M. Yang J. Rooney T.M. Fox A.N. Adalbert R. Powell E.H. Sheehan A.E. Avery M.A. Hackett R. Logan M.A. et al.dSarm/Sarm1 is required for activation of an injury-induced axon death pathway.Science. 2012; 337: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Loss of dSarm in Drosophila, or Sarm1 in mouse, resulted in severed distal axons remaining morphologically preserved for weeks after injury (Gerdts et al., 2013Gerdts J. Summers D.W. Sasaki Y. DiAntonio A. Milbrandt J. Sarm1-mediated axon degeneration requires both SAM and TIR interactions.J.

How dSarm/Sarm1 signals to execute axon death remains unclear, but dSarm/Sarm1 has recently been linked to the NAD+ metabolic pathway (Essuman et al., 2017Essuman K. Summers D.W. Sasaki Y. Mao X.

DiAntonio A. Milbrandt J. NMNAT1 inhibits axon degeneration via blockade of SARM1-mediated NAD(+) depletion.eLife. 2016; 5: 1010Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which based on extensive evidence appears to be a central mediator of axonal integrity. The first evidence supporting a role for NAD+ in axon maintenance came from the identification and characterization of the slow Wallerian degeneration (WldS) mouse, where severed axons fibers survived for weeks when detached from their cell bodies (Lunn et al., 1989Lunn E.R. Perry V.H. Brown M.C. Rosen H. Gordon S. Absence of Wallerian degeneration does not hinder regeneration in peripheral nerve.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1989; 1: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). This remarkable neuroprotective phenotype effect was due to a chromosomal rearrangement that led to the generation of the novel WldS molecule, a fusion protein consisting of the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (Nmnat1) and a short fragment of Ube4b (Mack et al., 2001Mack T.G. Reiner M. Beirowski B. Mi W. Emanuelli M. Wagner D. Thomson D. Gillingwater T. Court F. Conforti L. et al.Wallerian degeneration of injured axons and synapses is delayed by a Ube4b/Nmnat chimeric gene.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Consistent with a positive role for NAD+ in sustaining axons, NAD+ levels were found to plummet in axons immediately prior to granular fragmentation. Axon degeneration could be rescued by exogenous NAD+ or its precursors, and axotomy-induced NAD+ depletion was blocked by WldS (Wang et al., 2005Wang J. Zhai Q. Chen Y. Lin E. Gu W. McBurney M.W. He Z. A local mechanism mediates NAD-dependent protection of axon degeneration.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have demonstrated neuroprotective roles for NAD+-related metabolites (reviewed in Gerdts et al., 2016Gerdts J. Summers D.W. Milbrandt J. DiAntonio A. Axon Self-Destruction: new links among SARM1, MAPKs, and NAD+ metabolism.Neuron. 2016; 89: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The current proposed mechanism for activation of axon degeneration after injury is the depletion of Nmnat2, a labile form of Nmnat found in mammalian axons that is normally transported down axons from the soma (Gilley and Coleman, 2010Gilley J. Coleman M.P. Endogenous Nmnat2 is an essential survival factor for maintenance of healthy axons.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000300Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Nmnat2 is seen as a critical regulator of axon survival: its half-life approximates the latent phase prior to explosive axon fragmentation, depletion of Nmnat2 from axons induces spontaneous degeneration, and stabilization of Nmnat2 can phenocopy the effects of WldS (Gilley et al., 2013Gilley J. Adalbert R. Yu G. Coleman M.P. Rescue of peripheral and CNS axon defects in mice lacking NMNAT2.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 13410-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, Milde et al., 2013aMilde S. Fox A.N. Freeman M.R. Coleman M.P.

Gilley J. Coleman M.P. Subcellular localization determines the stability and axon protective capacity of axon survival factor Nmnat2.PLoS Biol. 2013; 11: e1001539Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The second line of evidence supporting a role for NAD+ in axonal protection came from drug screens for molecules that promoted neurogenesis (or neuroprotection) in vivo (Pieper et al., 2010Pieper A.A. Xie S. Capota E. Estill S.J. Zhong J. Long J.M. Becker G.L. Huntington P. Goldman S.E. Shen C.-H. et al.Discovery of a proneurogenic, neuroprotective chemical.Cell. 2010; 142: 39-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). P7C3 was identified as an activity-enhancing compound of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), a rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD+ salvage pathway, which likely leads to increased levels of NAD+ in injured axons to help sustain integrity (Wang et al., 2014Wang G. Han T. Nijhawan D. Theodoropoulos P. Naidoo J. Yadavalli S. Mirzaei H. Pieper A.A. Ready J.M. McKnight S.L. P7C3 neuroprotective chemicals function by activating the rate-limiting enzyme in NAD salvage.Cell. 2014; 158: 1324-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Derivatives of the P7C3 series have since been shown to be neuroprotective in many models of neurodegenerative disease, and in some models of neural injury (Blaya et al., 2014Blaya M.O. Bramlett H.M.

Huntington P.J. et al.P7C3 neuroprotective chemicals block axonal degeneration and preserve function after traumatic brain injury.Cell Rep. 2014; 8: 1731-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, whether P7C3 harbors the ability to attenuate axon death remains to be determined. Finally, recent work has demonstrated that NAD+ depletion after axotomy is blocked in Sarm1−/− mutants, and dimerization of the Sarm1 TIR domain can drive rapid depletion of NAD+ from cells and axons (Gerdts et al., 2015Gerdts J. Brace E.J. Sasaki Y. DiAntonio A. Milbrandt J. SARM1 activation triggers axon degeneration locally via NAD+ destruction.Science. 2015; 348: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it appears that the Sarm1 TIR domain harbors endogenous NAD+ hydrolase activity (Essuman et al., 2017Essuman K. Summers D.W. Sasaki Y. Mao X. DiAntonio A. Milbrandt J. The SARM1 Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain possesses intrinsic NAD(+) cleavage activity that promotes pathological axonal degeneration.Neuron. 2017; 93: 1334-1343.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus an emerging stepwise model of WD is that axotomy leads to depletion of labile pools of Nmnat2 in axons detached from their cell bodies; this in turn results in an initial depletion of NAD+ levels due to lack of new NAD+ synthesis and/or salvage, dSarm/Sarm1 signaling is then activated followed by rapid depletion of NAD+ levels below a threshold needed to maintain axonal integrity, and finally explosive degeneration of the axon ensues. NAD+ depletion from axons is a compelling model for WD, although alternative mechanisms cannot be excluded, due to our limited understanding of the genetics of axon death signaling. Besides dSarm/Sarm1, only one other molecule, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Highwire/Phr1, has been shown to be required for axon death in vivo: loss-of-function mutations in highwire/Phr1 potently suppress axon death in fly nerve injury models and mammalian sciatic nerve lesion experiments (Babetto et al., 2013Babetto E. Beirowski B. Russler E.V. Milbrandt J. DiAntonio A. The Phr1 ubiquitin ligase promotes injury-induced axon self-destruction.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 1422-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Xiong et al., 2012Xiong X. Hao Y. Sun K. Li J. Li X. Mishra B. Soppina P. Wu C. Hume R.I. Collins C.A. The Highwire ubiquitin ligase promotes axonal degeneration by tuning levels of Nmnat protein.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001440Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Highwire/Phr1 likely acts upstream of dSarm/Sarm1, and is required for the normal turnover of Nmnat/Nmnat2. Loss of Highwire/Phr1 is therefore proposed to stabilize Nmnat/Nmnat2 and maintain axonal pools of NAD+ (Babetto et al., 2013Babetto E. Beirowski B. Russler E.V. Milbrandt J. DiAntonio A. The Phr1 ubiquitin ligase promotes injury-induced axon self-destruction.Cell Rep. 2013; 3: 1422-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Are there other signaling molecules acting downstream of dSarm/Sarm1 to execute axonal death, or is NAD+ depletion the final step? Sarm1 has also been reported to drive axon death through a downstream MAPK signaling cascade (Yang et al., 2015Yang J. Wu Z. Renier N. Simon D.J. Uryu K. Park D.S. Greer P.A. Tournier C. Davis R.J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Pathological axonal death through a MAPK cascade that triggers a local energy deficit.Cell. 2015; 160: 161-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), similar to the signaling mechanism used by C. elegans TIR-1 during regulation of odorant receptor expression (Chuang and Bargmann, 2005Chuang C.-F. Bargmann C.I. A Toll-interleukin 1 repeat protein at the synapse specifies asymmetric odorant receptor expression via ASK1 MAPKKK signaling.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); however, this remains controversial. A recent contradictory study argues that MAPKs exert their effect by fine-tuning levels of Nmnat2 upstream of Sarm1 signaling (Walker et al., 2017Walker L.J. Summers D.W. Sasaki Y. Brace E.J. Milbrandt J. DiAntonio A. MAPK signaling promotes axonal degeneration by speeding the turnover of the axonal maintenance factor NMNAT2.eLife. 2017; 6: 545Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the identification and characterization of Axundead (Axed), an axonal BTB and BACK domain protein that signals downstream of dSarm. Axed is essential for injury-induced axon death signaling, and axed mutations can fully suppress degeneration induced by activated dSarm, or complete elimination of Nmnat activity from axons. Thus, Axed is a novel pro-degenerative signaling molecule, and the neuroprotective effects of loss of Axed exceed those of dsarm null mutants. We sought to identify novel genes required for axon death in vivo. We therefore performed an unbiased F1 forward genetic screen using mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) in glutamatergic sensory neurons of the adult Drosophila wing (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar, Neukomm et al., 2014Neukomm L.J. Burdett T.C. Gonzalez M.A. Züchner S. Freeman M.R. Rapid in vivo forward genetic approach for identifying axon death genes in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9965-9970Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Figure S1). Briefly, P0 males were mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and bred to virgin females (Figure S1A; detailed genotypes in Table S1) to produce F1 offspring males heterozygous for randomly introduced mutations and homozygous for the same mutations in GFP+-labeled sensory neuron MARCM clones (Figure S1B). Sensory neuron axons were severed by surgical removal of the distal half of the wing. Neurons with cell bodies proximal to the cut site served as uninjured controls, while neurons with cell bodies distal to the cut site were axotomized. To quantify axon death, we counted the number of uninjured control axons (cb, indicated in the upper right corner of each figure), and assayed in the most proximal region of the wing vein for additional intact severed axons (severed intact) or uncleared axonal debris (Figure S1B). Wild-type axons underwent fragmentation within 12 hr and were cleared from the wing nerve by ∼5 days post-axotomy (dpa). We assayed for mutants that retained intact, severed GFP+ axons 7 dpa (Figure S1B). In total we screened ∼10,000 mutagenized arms of chromosome 3L (∼20% of the Drosophila genome) and identified three mutants where severed axons remained morphologically intact 7 dpa (3L.0011, 3L.2094, and 3L.4314, respectively) (Figures S1B and S1C, see below). These F1 males were crossed to recover mutagenized chromosomes and establish mutant stocks (Figure S1C). Prior to injury, axons in each mutant line appeared normal, as did the morphology of sensory neuron cell bodies and dendrites. Uninjured clones survived for up to 50 days (below) and continued to exhibit normal morphology, suggesting that the identified mutations do not have detrimental effects on neuronal survival or morphology. Each of these mutants was homozygous lethal, even after several rounds of outcrossing, suggesting they each affected an essential gene. We therefore performed complementation tests for lethality among these mutants and with the dsarm896 allele, which is also lethal and on 3L. We defined two complementation groups, one consisting of dsarm896 and 3L.4314 (hereafter referred to as dsarm4314) and the other one consisting of 3L.0011 and 3L.2094 (Figure 1A). Based on the long-term survival of severed axons that should otherwise undergo axon death, we named this complementation group axundead (axed). Axons heterozygous for dsarm896 or axed2094, and axons transheterozygous for axed2094/dsarm896, all underwent axon death with kinetics similar to those observed in wild-type axons (Figure 1B). We attempted to rescue axon death in axed or dsarm mutants with a bacterial artificial chromosome containing a genomic copy of wild-type dsarm (BACdsarm). While BACdsarm fully rescued the axon death phenotype in dsarm4314 mutants, it failed to rescue axed0011 or axed2094 mutants (Figure S2). Together, these data argue that axed0011 and axed2094 are alleles of a new axon death gene. Severed axons in axed0011 and axed2094 mutants exhibited robust morphological preservation equivalent to that observed in dsarm mutants in the wing (Figure 1C). A total of 100% and 99.3% of severed axed2094 and axed0011 mutant axons, respectively, remained intact at 7 dpa (Figure 1D). Axon death in cholinergic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) is also blocked by axed mutations. While severed wild-type axons degenerated and were cleared within 7 days after axotomy, severed axed mutant axons remained preserved at both 7 and 50 dpa (Figure 1E). Thus, the protective effects of axed, like dsarm (Osterloh et al., 2012Osterloh J.M. Yang J. Rooney T.M. Fox A.N. Adalbert R. Powell E.H. Sheehan A.E. Avery M.A. Hackett R. Logan M.A. et al.dSarm/Sarm1 is required for activation of an injury-induced axon death pathway.Science. 2012; 337: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and hiw (Neukomm et al., 2014Neukomm L.J. Burdett T.C. Gonzalez M.A. Züchner S. Freeman M.R. Rapid in vivo forward genetic approach for identifying axon death genes in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9965-9970Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, Xiong et al., 2012Xiong X. Hao Y. Sun K. Li J. Li X. Mishra B. Soppina P. Wu C. Hume R.I. Collins C.A.

We next wanted to determine whether Axed function is specific for WD: we used the eye-specific glass multimer reporter to ectopically express pro-apoptotic hid (GMR-hid10), which results in widespread cell death in the developing visual system (Bergmann et al., 1998Bergmann A. Agapite J. McCall K. Steller H. The Drosophila gene hid is a direct molecular target of Ras-dependent survival signaling.Cell. 1998; 95: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A). While mutant clones of the Nedd2-like caspase droncI29 were able to suppress hid-mediated eye ablation, homozygous axed mutations did not modify cell death in this assay (Figure S3A). Likewise, we found that pruning of axons or dendrites in larval mushroom body (MB) γ neurons was not affected by axed mutations (Lee et al., 2000Lee T. Marticke S. Sung C. Robinow S. Luo L. Cell-autonomous requirement of the USP/EcR-B ecdysone receptor for mushroom body neuronal remodeling in Drosophila.Neuron. 2000; 28: 807-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) (Figure S3B). These observations indicate that loss of Axed, like dSarm (Osterloh et al., 2012Osterloh J.M. Yang J. Rooney T.M. Fox A.N. Adalbert R. Powell E.H. Sheehan A.E. Avery M.A. Hackett R. Logan M.A. et al.dSarm/Sarm1 is required for activation of an injury-induced axon death pathway.Science. 2012; 337: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), is sufficient to potently block WD, but not axon degeneration, during developmental pruning or apoptotic cell death. We mapped the lethality of axed0011 and axed2094 using molecularly defined deficiencies (Dfs) (Figure 2A) and assayed those Dfs that failed to complement lethality for defects in axon death in homozygous Df MARCM clones (Figures S4A and S4B). Both axed alleles failed to complement a large Df ZN47, and within that region one smaller Df, BSC411 (uncovering ∼100 genes), while all other partially overlapping deficiencies were able complement the lethality of both axed alleles. This allowed us to narrow down the interval to seven candidate genes, of which a single Minos transposon insertion within CG8398 (Mi{MIC} CG8398MI13270) failed to complement the lethality of both axed alleles. Consistent with our mapping strategy, MARCM clones of BSC411 or Mi{MIC}13270 (hereof axedMI13270) were also defective in axon death (Figures S4A and S4B). We identified a 16 bp deletion in exon 3 in axed0011 (Figure S5); however, we were not able to identify a molecular lesion within the open reading frame of CG8398 in axed2094, suggesting it might be a regulatory mutation (axed alleles listed in STAR Methods). To confirm that CG8398 is axed and required for axon death, we also created de novo axed alleles using two distinct methods, CRISPR/Cas9 and imprecise transposon excision (Metaxakis et al., 2005Metaxakis A. Oehler S. Klinakis A. Savakis C. Minos as a genetic and genomic tool in Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 2005; 171: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, Sebo et al., 2014Sebo Z.L. Lee H.B. Peng Y. Guo Y. A simplified and efficient germline-specific CRISPR/Cas9 system for Drosophila genomic engineering.Fly (Austin). 2014; 8: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CRISPR/Cas9 mutants harboring deletions in exon 2 (axedCrisprA, axedCrisprB, and axedCrisprC, containing 194 bp and two distinct 14 bp deletions, respectively), and Minos imprecise excision-based alleles (axedExMI07, axedExMI65, and axedExMI96), all failed to complement the lethality of our original axed mutagenesis alleles, and they were also defective in axon death (STAR Methods). We therefore conclude that CG8398 encodes the axed gene and hereafter refer to CG8398 as axed. The axed locus encodes two predicted isoforms (axedlong and axedshort, respectively). We generated transgenic flies harboring isoform-specific cDNA rescue constructs containing endogenous 5′ and 3′ UTRs under the control of the Gal4/UAS binary expression system (UAS-axedlong and UAS-axedshort). Expression of either construct was sufficient to rescue the axon death phenotype in all axed alleles tested (Figure 2B). The predicted Axed protein contains two evolutionary conserved domains, a BTB (bric-à-brac, tramtrack, broad complex) and a BACK (BTB and C-terminal Kelch) domain: BTB mediates protein dimerization, while BTB and BACK together mediate interactions with Cullin ubiquitin ligases (Stogios and Privé, 2004Stogios P.J. Privé G.G. The BACK domain in BTB-kelch proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 634-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of BTB and BACK domains often encode the substrate binding domain (Krek, 2003Krek W. BTB proteins as henchmen of Cul3-based ubiquitin ligases.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 950-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, Pintard et al., 2004Pintard L. Willems A. Peter M.

A hitchhiker’s guide to the cullin ubiquitin ligases: SCF and its kin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To explore the functional requirements of these domains, we generated deletion constructs lacking either the BTB, the BACK, or the C-terminal domain using axedlong as a reference (Figure 3A). Each of these constructs, when expressed in S2 cells, generated proteins of the appropriate size, indicating the predicted products are stably expressed in Drosophila cells (Figure 3B). For in vivo studies, we integrated each construct into the same genomic locus as UAS-axedlong and expressed each in wild-type clones as well as axed mutant backgrounds (Figures 3C and 3D). Neither expression of full-length Axed nor any of the deletion constructs led to spontaneous degeneration of axons or cell bodies. Moreover, none of these constructs dominantly suppress axon degeneration (Figure 3D). In axotomy assays, we found that while full-length axedlong rescued axon death to wild-type levels, expression of the construct lacking the BTB domain led to a partial rescue, with ∼60% axons fragmented or cleared by 7 dpa. Loss of the BACK domain rescued to a lesser extent, with only ∼25% axons fragmented or cleared by 7 dpa, and the construct lacking the C-terminal domain failed to rescue axon degeneration at any level. While the C-terminal domain appears to be essential for Axed to function in axon death, we cannot exclude the possibility that AxedΔCterm could be misfolded or mislocalized. Future studies aimed at identifying Axed binding partners will be essential to define the role of this domain in axon degeneration. Taken together, our data argue that the BTB and BACK domains are functionally important but partially dispensable for Axed function, while the C terminus is likely essential for pro-degenerative Axed signaling during axon death (Figure 3D). Many BTB-containing proteins are involved in the recruitment of substrates to Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complexes for ubiquitin tagging and proteasome degradation (Bennett et al., 2010Bennett E.J.

However, none of the CRL complex mutants we assayed resulted in an axon death phenotype (Table S2A), suggesting that they are not required for axon death or that genetic redundancy among them might mask their roles. How dSarm/Sarm1 executes axon death remains unclear, although recent studies propose that dSarm/Sarm1 drives axon death by rapid depletion of NAD+ (Gerdts et al., 2015Gerdts J. Brace E.J. Sasaki Y. DiAntonio A. Milbrandt J. SARM1 activation triggers axon degeneration locally via NAD+ destruction.Science. 2015; 348: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), which has been proposed to be mediated by a novel NAD+ hydrolase activity encoded in the Sarm1 TIR domain (Essuman et al., 2017Essuman K.

These results highlight a distinction between the amygdala and OFC in assessing reward history to support the flexible assignment of motivational meaning to sensory cues. A sensory stimulus can possess innately reinforcing qualities, or it may acquire motivational significance through learning how it predicts a rewarding or aversive event. However, changes in the external environment or in internal homeostatic state can cause humans and other animals to adjust their assessment of the motivational significance of a stimulus. For example, an innately reinforcing stimulus, such as a sweet tastant, can be more or less motivationally significant depending upon internal variables such as thirst, hunger, or satiation to that particular taste. Similarly, external variables can affect the motivational significance of a stimulus. The reinforcement contingencies of a stimulus can change, or environmental conditions can change, which will in turn adjust the motivational significance of a particular reward. To wit, a glass of a Premier Cru red burgundy wine may be quite rewarding if presented alongside a range of inferior wines, but the same glass of wine might be less appealing if tasted alongside a Grand Cru. In other words, if the Premier Cru is presented in each of two contexts defined by the other wines tasted in that occasion, then it can have different motivational meaning. Flexible cognitive and emotional behavior therefore requires neural mechanisms that adjust assessments of motivational significance to contextual changes defined by internal or external variables. Two anatomically interconnected brain structures commonly implicated in representing the motivational significance of sensory stimuli are the amygdala and OFC (Everitt et al., 2003Everitt B.J.

Chiba A.A. Gallagher M. Orbitofrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala encode expected outcomes during learning.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). However, the motivational significance of a CS can also change through an adaptive process even when its reinforcement contingencies do not change. Prior studies have shown that neural responses to a CS in OFC exhibit adaptation (Kobayashi et al., 2010Kobayashi S. Pinto de Carvalho O. Schultz W. Adaptation of reward sensitivity in orbitofrontal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 534-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Padoa-Schioppa, 2009Padoa-Schioppa C. Range-adapting representation of economic value in the orbitofrontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 14004-14014Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but it remains unknown whether same applies to the amygdala as adaptation has only been observed for responses to USs (Bermudez and Schultz, 2010bBermudez M.A. Schultz W. Reward magnitude coding in primate amygdala neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here we employed a contrast revaluation paradigm to manipulate the relative motivational meaning of a reward-predictive CS without changing its reinforcement contingencies. This paradigm changes the relative reward magnitude—but not the absolute reward magnitude—predicted by a CS by manipulating the reward magnitude predicted by another CS. The adjustment of motivational significance in this circumstance requires integrating reward history information about both types of trials. We observed that updating neural representations of motivational significance using this paradigm occurred more rapidly in OFC than amygdala. Consistent with this finding, recent reward history influenced responses to a CS in OFC but not amygdala. These data implicate OFC and not amygdala in flexible adjustments of relative motivational meaning driven by reward history. We trained two rhesus monkeys to perform a contrast revaluation task that manipulates the relative reward magnitude predicted by a stimulus while holding the absolute amount of reward predicted constant (Figure 1A; see STAR Methods). On each trial, the monkey was presented with either CS1 or CS2 followed by a trace interval and US delivery. Experiments had three blocks of trials. In block 1, CS1 predicted medium reward and CS2 predicted small reward. In block 2, CS1 still predicted medium reward but CS2 predicted large reward. Block 3 contained the same reinforcement contingencies as block 1. Thus, the relative reward magnitude predicted by CS1 changed from block to block despite predicting a fixed quantity of reward. Anticipatory licking during the interval between CS presentation and reward delivery—an approach behavior that indicates expectation of reward—was employed to assay the monkeys’ subjective assessment of the motivational significance of each CS. Figure 1B shows the anticipatory licking rate during a representative experiment. The monkey licks more after the CS that predicted the larger reward in each block. Moreover, anticipatory licking in response to CS1 decreases during block 2 even though predicted reward amount remains constant. During block 3, the licking response to CS1 increases again but not to the same level as in block 1. The lower licking rate for CS1 in block 3 may reflect satiation. Figure 1C shows the average licking rate across experimental sessions for CS1 and CS2. The licking rate for CS1 during block 2 is significantly lower than during block 1 (Figure 1D, p < 1e-06, Wilcoxon sign-rank test), an observation also true for each monkey individually. The mean licking rate increased significantly for block 3 compared to block 2 (p < 1e-06, Wilcoxon sign-rank test). Overall, these results imply that anticipatory licking is not just a response to the sensory properties or the volume amount of the anticipated reward. Instead, anticipatory licking indicates the amount of expected reward relative to other rewards received within a block of trials. We recorded the activity of 166 amygdala neurons (100 and 66 in each monkey, respectively) and 96 OFC neurons (62 and 34) during performance of the contrast revaluation task. Recorded cells were mainly in the basolateral complex of the amygdala and area 13/13 m of OFC (Figure S1). Neurons that respond most strongly to a CS predictive of either large or small rewards were observed in both amygdala and OFC, consistent with prior studies (Belova et al., 2007Belova M.A. Paton J.J.

Figures 2A and 2B show an amygdala neuron that prefers large over small rewards in all three blocks, while Figures 2C and 2D show an OFC neuron that prefers small over large rewards. We refer to these two types of selectivity as “positive” and “negative” neurons, respectively. The example cells depicted in Figure 2 exhibited activity that was modulated both by changes in the expected reward magnitude (CS2) and the relative magnitude of the reward (CS1). We next identified neurons whose responses were sensitive to absolute expected reward amount using an ANOVA (see STAR Methods), and then asked whether those same neurons also modulated their responses to changes in the relative reward amount of reward predicted by CS1. We found 101 amygdala neurons (61%) and 55 OFC neurons (57%) that were selective to reward magnitude. Of these neurons, about half showed positive selectivity (53/101 in the amygdala; 25/55 in OFC) and the other half showed negative selectivity. Figures 3A and 3C show the mean normalized (Z scored) firing rate of all neurons selective for reward magnitude plotted as a function of trial number in the amygdala and OFC. Across the populations of neurons recorded, the selected neurons tended to be modulated by changes in the relative amount of reward in a significant manner (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon sign-rank test); the observed modulation by relative reward magnitude is comparable in amplitude to that elicited by changes to actual reward amounts associated with CS2 (Figures 3B and 3D). These results held when considering each monkey individually (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test). Figure 3 demonstrates that neurons selective to expected reward magnitude are on average also selective to relative reward size. We then fit for each neuron a linear regression modeling firing rate as a sum of regressors reflecting block-type and the interaction between block-type and CS; we used this fit to classify neural activity as being significantly modulated by expected relative reward (bold orange in Figure S2 and STAR Methods). We found 54 (33%) cells in the amygdala, and 28 (29%) in OFC that met this criterion, and we refer to those cells as encoding the motivational significance of a CS. We investigated the dynamics of modulation in neurons in OFC and amygdala that change their responses when the relative amount of a reward changes, but not its absolute magnitude. For each CS1 trial following the revaluation in block 2, we computed the mean change in neural activity as a function of time within the trial (see STAR Methods). Figures 4A and 4B show the average change across all neurons in OFC (A) and the amygdala (B) encoding motivational significance adjusted by changes in relative reward amounts; in this plot, the activity of negative neurons was sign-flipped before averaging with positive neurons. The identified neurons in OFC show a faster and more pronounced decrease in their response to CS1 following the revaluation of CS2 compared to neurons in the amygdala. The change in activity during the CS presentation interval (shifted by 90 ms to account for visual response latency) is significantly greater in OFC than amygdala for the first three trials after revaluation, a result that was also observed when considering each monkey individually (p < 0.05, one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This suggests a predominant role of OFC in integrating the information necessary to compute the motivational significance of the current reward relative to other rewards within a block of trials. Following the second revaluation of CS2 in block 3, OFC and amygdala neurons updated their response to CS1 at about the same speed, likely reflecting the smaller adjustment in behavior observed for that transition (Figures 1C and 1D). In our task, the motivational significance of CS1 is determined by comparing the reward amounts predicted by CS1 and CS2 within a block of trials. As a result, the computation of motivational significance requires the integration of information about reward history. The more rapid updating of representations in OFC suggested that OFC and not amygdala may integrate information about reward history. In other words, the medium reward associated with CS1 may be perceived as less rewarding when following a large reward trial than when following another medium reward trial. By contrast, recent CS2 trials resulting in a small reward will make the medium reward associated with CS1 seem better. Thus, recent CS2 trials may affect activity on current CS1 trials so as to support the computation of motivational significance. We assessed the effect of the magnitude of the currently predicted reward in relation to the magnitude of rewards in the recent past by fitting the neural activity of the cell populations encoding motivational significance with an extended version of the previous regression model where factors are added to capture an effect of reward history (see STAR Methods). Figures 4C and 4D show the coefficients associated with the five reward history regressors for the OFC (C) and amygdala (D) populations of neurons. In OFC, the three most recent trials have a significant effect on the current neural activity (coefficients significantly different from 0, p < 0.05, t statistic; Figure 4C). There was not a significant difference between monkeys for each beta coefficient estimate (p > 0.05 in each case). This means that, all other factors being equal, if the current reward is larger than a past reward, the neural activity in a positive neuron will be higher than if the two rewards are equal. Conversely, if the past reward is larger than the current one, a relative decrease in firing rate will be observed. Interestingly, reward history did not have an effect on the activity of identified amygdala neurons (Figure 4D), thus suggesting that although amygdala neurons modify their activity to reflect the motivational significance of a current predicted reward relative to other recently received rewards, they might not be responsible for the integration of information in the environment that facilitates this calculation. We also performed the analysis of the effect reward history on individual cells and observed qualitatively similar results (Figure S3). Flexible emotional and cognitive behavior demands mechanisms that can update representations of the motivational significance of stimuli. In this study, a contrast revaluation task was used to investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie adjustments in the representation of the motivational significance of a CS. In this task, manipulations in motivational significance can be caused by changes in the relative amount of reward predicted by a CS while holding the absolute amount of reward associated with this CS constant. Monkeys’ anticipatory licking behavior tracked the motivational significance of this CS (Figure 1). Neurons in the amygdala and OFC were sensitive to changes in motivational significance even though the actual reward associated with this CS did not change (Figures 2 and 3). The neural representation of motivational significance caused by changes in the relative amount of predicted reward updated more rapidly in OFC than in amygdala, and recent reward history modulated neural responses in OFC but not in amygdala (Figure 4). Satiation is unlikely to account for our results, since neural activity tracked an increase in motivational significance during the final block of trials, when effects of satiation would be maximal. Moreover, satiation has been observed to affect neural responses in ventro-medial pre-frontal cortex more frequently than in OFC (Simmons et al., 2010Simmons J.M. Minamimoto T. Murray E.A. Richmond B.J. Selective ablations reveal that orbital and lateral prefrontal cortex play different roles in estimating predicted reward value.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15878-15887Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Overall, these data suggest a primary role for the OFC as compared to the amygdala in flexible behavior driven by contrast revaluation. The neural representation of motivational significance that we describe may be conceptually related to neural representations of value that have been reported previously in OFC and the amygdala (Belova et al., 2007Belova M.A. Paton J.J.

In three studies, we explored the array of discrete emotions people experience after being prompted to express or recall gratitude. In Studies 1 and 2, two different gratitude exercises produced not only greater feelings of gratitude relative to two positive emotion control conditions (i.e., recalling relief), but also higher levels of other socially relevant states like elevation, connectedness, and indebtedness. In a third study, conducted in both the U.S. and S. Korea, we compared a gratitude exercise to another positive emotion elicitation (i.e., recalling a kind act) and to a neutral task, and again found that the gratitude exercise prompted greater gratitude, elevation, indebtedness, and guilt, but no more embarrassment or shame, than the two comparison conditions. Additionally, in all three studies, emodiversity and cluster analyses revealed that gratitude exercises led to the simultaneous experience of both pleasant and unpleasant socially-relevant states. In sum, although it may seem obvious that gratitude exercises would evoke grateful, positive states, a meta-analysis of our three studies revealed that gratitude exercises actually elicit a mixed emotional experience-one that simultaneously leads individuals to feel uplifted and indebted."

https://openalex.org/W2726420849,"Epidemiological findings support the hypothesis that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA). Moreover, OA cartilage from patients with T2DM exhibits a greater response to inflammatory stress, but the molecular mechanism is unclear. To investigate whether the antioxidant defense system participates in this response, we examined here the expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf-2), a master antioxidant transcription factor, and of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), one of its main target genes, in OA cartilage from T2DM and non-T2DM patients as well as in murine chondrocytes exposed to high glucose (HG). Ex vivo experiments indicated that Nrf-2 and HO-1 expression is reduced in T2DM versus non-T2DM OA cartilage (0.57-fold Nrf-2 and 0.34-fold HO-1), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release was increased in samples with low HO-1 expression. HG-exposed, IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes had lower Nrf-2 levels in vitro, particularly in the nuclear fraction, than chondrocytes exposed to normal glucose (NG). Accordingly, HO-1 levels were also decreased (0.49-fold) in these cells. The HO-1 inducer cobalt protoporphyrin IX more efficiently attenuated PGE2 and IL-6 release in HG+IL-1β-treated cells than in NG+IL-1β-treated cells. Greater reductions in HO-1 expression and increase in PGE2/IL-6 production were observed in HG+IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes from Nrf-2−/− mice than in chondrocytes from wild-type mice. We conclude that the Nrf-2/HO-1 axis is a critical pathway in the hyperglucidic-mediated dysregulation of chondrocytes. Impairments in this antioxidant system may explain the greater inflammatory responsiveness of OA cartilage from T2DM patients and may inform treatments of such patients."

Glutamatergic activity limits this inter-synaptic diffusion by trapping GABAARs at excitatory synapses. This novel form of activity-dependent hetero-synaptic interplay is likely to modulate dendritic synaptic signaling. The lateral diffusion of surface neurotransmitter receptor and its transient trapping at synapses is regulated by neuronal activity and plays a key role in adjusting receptor number at synapses during synaptic plasticity (Choquet and Triller, 2013Choquet D. Triller A. The dynamic synapse.Neuron. 2013; 80: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Moreover, the fast exchange between desensitized synaptic AMPA receptors and naive extrasynaptic receptors modulates the amplitude of glutamatergic synaptic currents (Constals et al., 2015Constals A.

Surface mobility of postsynaptic AMPARs tunes synaptic transmission.Science. 2008; 320: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Receptor lateral mobility can therefore be an important determinant of synaptic transmission. To date, receptor diffusion has been examined only at the level of individual synapses, limiting our understanding of how diffusion shapes synaptic currents. It has never been investigated whether receptor lateral diffusion may transfer information between two or more adjacent synapses. We hypothesized that synaptic receptors in a given activation state at one synapse may diffuse and contact a neighboring synapse in the same conformational state, thus transmitting its activation history. In the present study, we tested this idea at inhibitory synapses, as the persistence of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) in long-living desensitized states (Overstreet et al., 2000Overstreet L.S. Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Slow desensitization regulates the availability of synaptic GABA(A) receptors.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Petrini et al., 2011Petrini E.M. Nieus T.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 1752-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) may favor potential synaptic crosstalk mediated by the inter-synaptic diffusion of GABAARs. We report that following sustained stimulation of an individual GABAergic synapse, desensitized GABAARs laterally diffuse at neighboring dendritic GABAergic synapses, where they reduce the amplitude of inhibitory synaptic currents. To test whether GABAARs diffuse between two dendritic inhibitory synapses, we performed single particle tracking experiments (SPT) on endogenous GABAARs in cultured hippocampal neurons. The profile of the dendrites was identified by EGFP transfection and the position of inhibitory synapses by live immunostaining of vGAT (Figure 1A). During 1-min-long SPT experiments, we observed several α1-containing GABAARs contacting two adjacent inhibitory synapses (Figure 1B). Such inter-synaptic diffusion occurred in ∼15% of synaptic GABAAR trajectories (n = 179, in 26 neurons from 8 cultures). The time required for GABAARs to contact two adjacent inhibitory synapses (typically 2–4 μm apart) ranged from a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds (Figure 1C). Interestingly, the inter-synaptic displacement times were comparable to the kinetics of slow desensitized state(s) of GABAAR subtypes expressed at GABAergic synapses (Overstreet et al., 2000Overstreet L.S. Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Slow desensitization regulates the availability of synaptic GABA(A) receptors.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Petrini et al., 2011Petrini E.M. Nieus T. Ravasenga T. Succol F. Guazzi S. Benfenati F. Barberis A. Influence of GABAAR monoliganded states on GABAergic responses.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 1752-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This result supports the hypothesis that receptors can swap between synapses in the desensitized state(s), thus mediating synaptic crosstalk. As reported in Figure 1D, the median diffusion coefficient (see STAR Methods) of GABAARs swapping among neighbor synapses was 0.07 μm2s−1 (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.04 ÷ 0.13 μm2s−1, n = 146). However, according to the free-boundary Brownian diffusion equation, such diffusion coefficient values accounted only for the slower inter-synaptic transition times, whereas the fastest events could not be fully predicted. Interestingly, we found that taking into account the narrow and elongated shape of dendrites, the diffusion coefficients in the longitudinal axis (see STAR Methods) were significantly higher than the transversal one (Figures S1A and S1B) and could explain inter-synaptic displacements even in the sub-second time range (Figure S1C). Model simulations based on the values of longitudinal diffusion coefficients (that are important for the inter-synaptic receptor diffusion) match the experimental distribution of inter-synaptic transition times (Figures S1D and S1E). Since the mobility of GABAARs depends on the intracellular calcium concentration (Bannai et al., 2009Bannai H. Lévi S. Schweizer C. Inoue T. Launey T. Racine V. Sibarita J.B. Mikoshiba K. Triller A. Activity-dependent tuning of inhibitory neurotransmission based on GABAAR diffusion dynamics.Neuron. 2009; 62: 670-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, Bannai et al., 2015Bannai H.

Bidirectional Control of Synaptic GABAAR Clustering by Glutamate and Calcium.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 2768-2780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we next studied how their inter-synaptic diffusion responds to the activation of the light-gated Ca2+-permeable ionotropic glutamate receptor (LiGluK2) (Volgraf et al., 2006Volgraf M. Gorostiza P. Numano R. Kramer R.H. Isacoff E.Y. Trauner D. Allosteric control of an ionotropic glutamate receptor with an optical switch.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). LiGluK2 is an optogenetic tool to precisely control calcium influx at high spatial and temporal resolution (see STAR Methods, Figure S2A). Recombinant GluK2 receptors accumulate at glutamatergic synapses similarly to native ones (Martin et al., 2008Martin S. Bouschet T. Jenkins E.L. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Bidirectional regulation of kainate receptor surface expression in hippocampal neurons.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36435-36440Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and so LiGluK2 activation is expected to mimic excitatory synaptic activity. In LiGluK2-GFP-transfected neurons, we used SPT to track the HA-tagged α1 subunit of GABAAR (HA-GABAAR), which is incorporated into GABAARs without affecting their surface expression, synaptic accumulation (Figure S2B), lateral mobility (Figure S2C), or inter-synaptic transitions (compare Figures 1C and 1D to Figures 2B and 2C ). During LiGluK2 activation, HA-GABAARs were significantly less mobile in the inter-synaptic space (Figure 2A), as demonstrated by a lower inter-synaptic diffusion coefficient, rightward-shifted inter-synaptic transition time histogram and cumulative distribution, and increased time for inter-synaptic displacement (Figures 2B and 2C). Calcium entry therefore decreases the inter-synaptic mobility of HA-GABAARs. To corroborate that GABAAR inter-synaptic diffusion depends on calcium, we exploited an altered form of LiGluK2, in which the substitution of glutamine 621 for an arginine in the pore lining M2 segment (Q/R editing) abolishes the GluK2 receptor’s calcium permeability (Burnashev et al., 1995Burnashev N. Zhou Z. Neher E. Sakmann B. Fractional calcium currents through recombinant GluR channels of the NMDA, AMPA and kainate receptor subtypes.J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 403-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As expected, LiGluK2(Q621R) displayed negligible calcium conductance (Figure S2A). In SPT experiments, the activation of LiGluK2(Q621R) did not significantly reduce the inter-synaptic diffusion coefficient of HA-tagged GABAAR (Figures 2D and 2E). However, LiGluK2(Q621R) activation did still cause a significant increase in GABAAR inter-synaptic displacement time (Figure 2F). A possible explanation for this partial effect might be that the depolarization induced by LiGluK2(Q621R) integrated over 1 min elicits a calcium increase through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). This hypothesis was tested by calcium imaging. Despite the Ca2+-impermeability of LiGluK2(Q621R), its 1-min activation caused a mild intracellular calcium increase (30% of that mediated by wild-type [WT] LiGluK2) (Figure S2D). Importantly, such “residual” Ca2+ entry was completely prevented by the application of ω-conotoxin MVIIC (2 μm) and nifedipine (10 μm) (Figure S2D bottom). As a third method of testing calcium dependence, we next activated LiGluK2 receptors in the absence of extracellular calcium. Compared to control conditions, LiGluK2 activation in the absence of extracellular calcium did not significantly change either the inter-synaptic diffusion coefficient or the transition times of HA-α1 subunits (Figures 2G–2I). To further clarify the sources of Ca2+ responsible for the modulation of GABAAR inter-synaptic mobility, we next examined the role of VGCCs during LiGluK2 activation. The application of ω-conotoxin and nifedipine reduced the Ca2+ entry elicited by WT LiGluK2 by ∼40%, as quantified in calcium imaging experiments (Figure S2D top), but left unchanged the LiGluK2-dependent effects on GABAAR inter-synaptic lateral mobility (Figures S2E and S2F). This indicates that upon LiGluK2 activation, direct Ca2+ entry through LiGluK2 (which accounts for ∼60% of the total intracellular Ca2+ rise triggered by LiGluK2 opening) is the major player in the decrease of GABAAR diffusion between two adjacent synapses. Further control experiments ruled out any effect of the UV illumination on GABAAR lateral diffusion (Figure S2G) or on intracellular Ca2+ concentration (Figure S2H). As excitatory-like stimuli modulate inter-synaptic GABAAR diffusion, we considered a potential role for excitatory synapses in this phenomenon. We used the same experimental set-up to track inter-synaptic trajectories of HA-tagged GABAAR, but also analyzed glutamatergic synapses, identified by Homer1C-DsRed expression (Figure 3A). Interestingly, at glutamatergic synapses, LiGluK2 stimulation caused GABAARs to be markedly immobilized and confined (Figure 3B), indicated by the reduced synaptic diffusion coefficient, increased synaptic dwell time, and lower steady state of the mean square displacement (MSD) versus time curve (Figure 3C). These data reveal that the hetero-synaptic trapping of GABAARs at glutamatergic synapses plays a key role in the stimulus-dependent reduction of GABAAR inter-synaptic diffusion. In additional experiments, we found that at inhibitory synapses, LiGluK2 activation increases the mobilization of synaptic GABAARs, shown by their increased diffusion coefficient and decreased confinement (Figure S3). Taken together, our data show that light-controlled activation of glutamate receptors increases synaptic diffusion at inhibitory synapses and decreases inter-synaptic diffusion of GABAAR. Finally, we investigated the functional impact of inter-synaptic HA-tagged GABAAR diffusion on inhibitory synaptic transmission. We hypothesized that the spreading of GABAAR in long-living desensitized states could tune the availability of naive synaptic receptors at adjacent GABAergic synapses. To test this, we uncaged GABA (DPNI-GABA) at individual GABAergic synapses by UV-laser photolysis at diffraction limited spots (see STAR Methods and Figure S4A). With this approach, we compared the uncaging inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) recorded at a given GABAergic synapse (synapse A) before and after the induction of GABAAR desensitization by a uIPSC train delivered at a neighboring GABAergic synapse (synapse B) (Figure 4A). We observed that uIPSC trains (4 s, 16 Hz) transiently reduced uIPSC amplitude at synapses located 2–4 μm from the stimulated synapse (Figures 4B and 4C, black). When LiGluK2 receptors were activated (i.e., when GABAAR inter-synaptic diffusion was reduced), the extent of desensitization at neighboring synapses was significantly lower than in controls (Figures 4B and 4C, green). To further test the effect of receptor mobility on desensitization, we used the cross-link protocol (X-link) (Gerrow and Triller, 2014Gerrow K. Triller A. GABAA receptor subunit composition and competition at synapses are tuned by GABAB receptor activity.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2014; 60: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, Heine et al., 2008Heine M. Groc L. Frischknecht R. Béïque J.C. Lounis B. Rumbaugh G. Huganir R.L. Cognet L. Choquet D. Surface mobility of postsynaptic AMPARs tunes synaptic transmission.Science. 2008; 320: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) to immobilize GABAARs (Figure 4D). Notably, when GABAAR was immobilized, uIPSC trains induced minimal desensitization at neighboring synapses (Figures 4B and 4C, red). These results were recapitulated when uIPSCs were mediated by endogenous GABAAR, ruling out possible artifacts due to α1-HA overexpression (Figure S4B). It may be posited that the steric hindrance of the X-link protocol interferes with neurotransmitter diffusion, which could account for the reduced GABAAR desensitization. To exclude this possibility, we X-linked neuroligin3 (NL3), a transmembrane synaptic protein distinct from GABAAR. In these conditions, there was no significant reduction of synaptic desensitization (Figure S4C), demonstrating that the X-link protocol does not affect the diffusion of uncaged neurotransmitter. In order to demonstrate that the 4-s uIPSC train at 16 Hz effectively induced GABAAR desensitization, the amplitude of uIPSCs before and after the uIPSC train was tested at the same synapse at which the train was delivered. We found that 660 ms after the uIPSC train, uIPSC amplitude was depressed by ∼60%, thus indicating massive desensitization (Figure S4D). In X-link conditions, the extent of desensitization was further increased, with uIPSC amplitude 660 ms after the train reduced by ∼73% (Figure S4D). These results show that the exchange of synaptic receptors with naive ones by lateral diffusion reduces the amount of synaptic desensitization, in line with what is observed for AMPA receptors at glutamatergic synapses (Heine et al., 2008Heine M. Groc L. Frischknecht R. Béïque J.C. Lounis B. Rumbaugh G. Huganir R.L. Cognet L. Choquet D. Surface mobility of postsynaptic AMPARs tunes synaptic transmission.Science. 2008; 320: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the X-link increased the desensitization “at the same synapses” due to the trapping of desensitized receptors, while it reduced the desensitization at “neighboring synapses,” due to the inability of desensitized receptors to spread from the desensitized synapse. We next assessed whether receptors in the desensitized state are able to diffuse between two synapses. To this end, we studied the inter-synaptic displacements of HA-GABAAR through SPT experiments during the bath application of 100 μM GABA to induce massive GABAAR desensitization. The HA-GABAAR diffusion coefficient and inter-synaptic transition times were comparable in control conditions and in 100 μM GABA (Figures S4E and S4F), thus confirming that desensitized GABAARs are able to diffuse inter-synaptically. Since receptor saturation at the stimulated synapse would maximize the number of desensitized receptors leaving for neighboring synapses, we also examined synaptic GABAAR saturation by quantifying uIPSC variability. The coefficient of variation (CV) of uIPSCs elicited by laser pulses delivered at the same synapse every 10 s to uncage 1 mM and 2 mM GABA were similar, indicating that saturation was achieved. Hence, individual pulses were sufficient to saturate postsynaptic receptors (Figure S4G). Moreover, the comparable CV of uIPSCs mediated by native, HA-tagged, and X-linked GABAARs (Figure S4G) suggests that GABA uncaging pulses are saturating in all of the conditions tested in the present study. Taken together, these experiments indicate that the diffusion of desensitized GABAARs between adjacent dendritic GABAergic synapses shapes inhibitory synaptic currents (Figure 4E). The present study provides evidence for a novel mechanism of synaptic crosstalk based on the diffusion of desensitized GABAARs between inhibitory synapses (Figure 4E). We demonstrate that a given inhibitory synapse may transfer the “memory” of its recent activation to neighboring inhibitory synapses. Receptor lateral mobility is a fundamental determinant of synaptic function at glutamatergic synapses, where AMPA receptor diffusion between synaptic and extrasynaptic areas modulates the amplitude of synaptic excitatory currents (Constals et al., 2015Constals A. Penn A.C. Compans B. Toulmé E. Phillipat A. Marais S. Retailleau N. Hafner A.S. Coussen F. Hosy E. Choquet D.

Surface mobility of postsynaptic AMPARs tunes synaptic transmission.Science. 2008; 320: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The present study shows for the first time that surface receptor diffusion can functionally connect two distinct synapses. At inhibitory synapses, this new form of inter-synaptic crosstalk relies on the fine temporal relationship between GABAAR gating kinetics and the time needed for GABAAR to undergo inter-synaptic displacements. Following prolonged activation, GABAARs are absorbed into long-living desensitized states lasting up to tens of seconds (Overstreet et al., 2000Overstreet L.S. Jones M.V. Westbrook G.L. Slow desensitization regulates the availability of synaptic GABA(A) receptors.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7914-7921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Petrini et al., 2011Petrini E.M. Nieus T. Ravasenga T. Succol F. Guazzi S. Benfenati F. Barberis A. Influence of GABAAR monoliganded states on GABAergic responses.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 1752-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This timing is a distinctive GABAAR gating feature that represents a key requisite for efficient inter-synaptic communication. In this context, it should be noted that the time course of current amplitude reduction at neighboring synapses, here shown to depend on inter-synaptic receptor swap, is also influenced by the rate of GABAAR exit from desensitization, which in turn depends on the duration/concentration of GABA pulses (Petrini et al., 2011Petrini E.M. Nieus T. Ravasenga T. Succol F. Guazzi S. Benfenati F. Barberis A. Influence of GABAAR monoliganded states on GABAergic responses.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 1752-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Another important determinant for the efficiency of inter-synaptic crosstalk is the level of synaptic receptor saturation during synaptic activity. Indeed, in a saturation regime, when all the postsynaptic receptors are activated, any decrease in the number of “activatable” receptors would result in a sizable reduction of synaptic current amplitude. In our experiments, a single GABA uncaging pulse saturates postsynaptic receptors in all conditions tested (Figure S4G), while a number of studies have shown that at central synapses, uniquantal neurotransmitter release may either be saturating or sub-saturating (Auger and Marty, 1997Auger C. Marty A. Heterogeneity of functional synaptic parameters among single release sites.Neuron. 1997; 19: 139-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Poncer et al., 1996Poncer J.C. Dürr R. Gähwiler B.H. Thompson S.M. Modulation of synaptic GABAA receptor function by benzodiazepines in area CA3 of rat hippocampal slice cultures.Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, saturation of postsynaptic receptor clusters can be still attained by (1) repetitive synaptic activations and/or (2) multi-vesicular release (Rudolph et al., 2015Rudolph S. Tsai M.C. von Gersdorff H. Wadiche J.I. The ubiquitous nature of multivesicular release.Trends Neurosci. 2015; 38: 428-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms proposed here may also occur during sustained synaptic activity and/or specific releasing patterns at synapses that would not be saturated by a single neurotransmitter vesicle. In the present study, we investigated the role of calcium in the GABAAR inter-synaptic mobility by exploiting LiGluK2, an optogenetic tool that allows the control of Ca2+ inflow with high temporal precision. We observed that intracellular Ca2+ rise mediated by LiGluK2 activation reduces GABAAR mobility, thus limiting inter-synaptic crosstalk. In contrast, a previous study found that sustained network stimulation promoted GABAAR mobilization (Bannai et al., 2009Bannai H. Lévi S. Schweizer C. Inoue T. Launey T. Racine V. Sibarita J.B. Mikoshiba K. Triller A. Activity-dependent tuning of inhibitory neurotransmission based on GABAAR diffusion dynamics.Neuron. 2009; 62: 670-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is most likely due to the different type of stimulation used. While Bannai et al., 2009Bannai H. Lévi S. Schweizer C. Inoue T. Launey T. Racine V. Sibarita J.B. Mikoshiba K. Triller A. Activity-dependent tuning of inhibitory neurotransmission based on GABAAR diffusion dynamics.Neuron. 2009; 62: 670-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar induced massive Ca2+ entry by enhancing excitation or by blocking inhibition, in our experiments we elicited a mild and controlled Ca2+ rise, likely mimicking glutamatergic synaptic activity. Consistent with this explanation, it has been recently demonstrated that sustained Ca2+ entry increases GABAAR mobility, whereas moderate Ca2+ elevation induces GABAAR immobilization (Bannai et al., 2015Bannai H. Niwa F. Sherwood M.W. Shrivastava A.N. Arizono M. Miyamoto A. Sugiura K. Lévi S. Triller A. Mikoshiba K. Bidirectional Control of Synaptic GABAAR Clustering by Glutamate and Calcium.Cell Rep. 2015; 13: 2768-2780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this scenario, glutamatergic synapses tightly intercalated with dendritic GABAergic synapses (i.e., the typical synapse distribution at proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons; Megías et al., 2001Megías M. Emri Z. Freund T.F. Gulyás A.I. Total number and distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) are optimally located to tune GABAAR inter-synaptic diffusion through mild and localized dendritic Ca2+ inflow. However, such modulation of GABAAR diffusion by Ca2+ may be significantly different in specific neuronal sub-compartments, such as the somata of pyramidal neurons that exclusively receive inhibitory inputs (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar), or the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons, which mainly have glutamatergic synapses (Megías et al., 2001Megías M. Emri Z. Freund T.F. Gulyás A.I. Total number and distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). In addition, the impact of Ca2+ dynamics on GABAAR diffusion in micro- and nano-domains is still to be elucidated and is expected to add further complexity to the lateral-diffusion-mediated synaptic crosstalk. An important finding of this study is that in response to glutamatergic stimulation (mimicked by LiGluK2 activation), GABAARs are trapped at glutamatergic synapses, which significantly limits GABAAR inter-synaptic diffusion. Although the presence of GABAARs at excitatory synapses has already been described (Nusser et al., 1996Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Stephenson F.A. Somogyi P. The alpha 6 subunit of the GABAA receptor is concentrated in both inhibitory and excitatory synapses on cerebellar granule cells.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 103-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Renner et al., 2012Renner M. Schweizer C. Bannai H. Triller A. Lévi S. Diffusion barriers constrain receptors at synapses.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e43032Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this is the first evidence that a hetero-synaptic interaction is modulated by activity. It has been argued previously that in steady-state conditions, local molecular crowding at the glutamatergic postsynaptic density (PSD) may reduce the GABAAR diffusion coefficient without any increase in either receptor accumulation or dwell time at excitatory synapses (Renner et al., 2012Renner M. Schweizer C. Bannai H. Triller A. Lévi S. Diffusion barriers constrain receptors at synapses.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e43032Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, the increased GABAAR dwell time at glutamatergic synapses reported here would suggest molecular interactions between GABAAR and the glutamatergic synaptic scaffold. Nevertheless, Renner et al., 2012Renner M. Schweizer C. Bannai H. Triller A. Lévi S. Diffusion barriers constrain receptors at synapses.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e43032Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar also reported that the molecular crowding can induce transient accumulation of GABAARs at glutamatergic synapses. In this alternative scenario, Ca2+-dependent rearrangements of the excitatory PSD (Opazo et al., 2010Opazo P. Labrecque S. Tigaret C.M. Frouin A. Wiseman P.W. De Koninck P. Choquet D. CaMKII triggers the diffusional trapping of surface AMPARs through phosphorylation of stargazin.Neuron. 2010; 67: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) may temporarily trap GABAARs at excitatory synapses, thus explaining our observation without invoking the binding of GABAAR at the glutamatergic PSD. It might be suggested that uncaged GABA could directly activate and desensitize GABAARs at nearby synapses due to synapse-to-synapse spillover. This possibility can be ruled out by the negligible desensitization observed at neighboring synapses following uIPSC trains when GABAARs are immobilized by X-link (Figure 4 and Figure S4B), a procedure that does not prevent GABA spillover (Figure S4C). However, it is likely that uncaged GABA diffusing outside the synapse reaches and desensitizes peri-and extra-synaptic GABAARs, resulting in their contribution to the inter-synaptic crosstalk. Indeed, neurotransmitter diffusion in the extrasynaptic space is a feature of synaptic transmission, especially under repetitive synaptic activation (Rudolph et al., 2015Rudolph S. Tsai M.C. von Gersdorff H. Wadiche J.I. The ubiquitous nature of multivesicular release.Trends Neurosci. 2015; 38: 428-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Hence, during sustained activity at a given synapse that elicits sizable agonist spillover in the extrasynaptic space, a larger population of desensitized GABAARs (including peri- and extrasynaptic receptors) would modulate the efficacy of neighboring synapses by lateral diffusion. Therefore, it can be speculated that the inclusion of desensitized peri- or extrasynaptic GABAARs at neighboring synapses during sustained inhibitory synaptic activity would be an extended feature of synaptic crosstalk through GABAAR lateral diffusion. Conventional synaptic transmission assumes that synapses work independently, a condition that maximizes information storage in the brain (Barbour, 2001Barbour B. An evaluation of synapse independence.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7969-7984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence challenge this view, favoring the id"

https://openalex.org/W2724446621,"Celebrities are frequently used in conservation marketing as a tool to raise awareness, generate funding and effect behaviour change. The importance of evaluating effectiveness is widely recognised in both marketing and conservation but, to date, little research into the effectiveness of celebrity endorsement as a tool for conservation marketing has been published. Using a combination of interviews and an online choice survey instrument, we investigated the extent to which a sample of UK-based conservation organisations, and other charities, evaluate their own usage of celebrity endorsement, and then carried out an experimental evaluation of a hypothetical marketing campaign. This experiment compared participants' willingness-to-engage (WTE) with, and recall of, a conservation message presented in versions of an advert featuring one of three prominent UK celebrities (David Beckham, Chris Packham or HRH Prince William) or a non-celebrity control treatment (featuring Crawford Allan, a director of TRAFFIC USA). We find that the organisations we interviewed did not routinely evaluate their marketing campaigns featuring celebrities. Furthermore, our experiment provides evidence that celebrity endorsement can produce both positive and negative effects. Participants were more willing to engage when presented with an advert featuring one of the three celebrities than the non-celebrity control, and WTE varied according to the characteristics of the celebrity and the respondent. However, celebrities were less effective at generating campaign message recall than non-celebrities. These findings suggest that celebrity endorsement should be used carefully. Further work is required to fully understand the role celebrity endorsers can play in conservation but, drawing on best practice from the field of marketing, this study introduces an approach to evaluation which could be applied more widely to improve the effectiveness of conservation marketing."

https://openalex.org/W2726768037,"In both multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) is critical for pathogenic T helper 17 (Th17) cell migration to the central nervous system (CNS). Whereas many cytokines and their receptors are potently regulated via post-transcriptional mechanisms in response to various stimuli, how CCR6 expression is post-transcriptionally regulated in Th17 cells is unknown. Here, using RNA-binding protein HuR conditional knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice, we present evidence that HuR post-transcriptionally regulates CCR6 expression by binding to and stabilizing Ccr6 mRNA and by promoting CCR6 translation. We also found that HuR down-regulates several microRNA expressions, which could target the 3′-UTR of Ccr6 mRNA for decay. Accordingly, knock-out of HuR reduced CCR6 expression on Th17 cells and impaired their migration to CNS compared with the response of WT Th17 cells and thereby ameliorated EAE. Together, these findings highlight how HuR contributes to Th17 cell-mediated autoimmune neuroinflammation and support the notion that targeting HuR might be a potential therapeutic intervention for managing autoimmune disorders of the CNS."

In conclusion, this study gives insights into apoE biology and establishes a robust screening system to monitor apoE conformation. ApoE is a secreted lipoprotein that is present in the human population in three different isoforms, E2, E3, and E4. These differ from one another by single Cys-Arg interchanges at residues 112 and 158, with E4 harboring Arg at both sites, E3 at Cys-112 and Arg-158, and E2 having Cys at both sites. There are predicted to be three primary structural features: an N-terminal receptor interaction domain (1.Weisgraber K.H. Apolipoprotein E: structure-function relationships.Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a presumably flexible bridge (2.Morrow J.A. Hatters D.M. Lu B. Hochtl P. Oberg K.A. Rupp B. Weisgraber K.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22358-22365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE is produced mainly by the liver in the periphery and is not believed to substantially cross into the central nervous system (CNS) (4.Liu M. Kuhel D.G. Shen L. Hui D.Y. Woods S.C. Apolipoprotein E does not cross the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, as revealed by an improved technique for sampling CSF from mice.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp.

Tse E. Taylor J.M. Two distal downstream enhancers direct expression of the human apolipoprotein E gene to astrocytes in the brain.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 812-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inheritance of the E4 allele is strongly associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, and inheritance of the E2 allele is strongly associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease compared with the most common E3 allele (6.Corder E.H.

Sci. 2006; 31: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), knowledge of the tertiary and quaternary structure of apoE is limited. It has been shown both through X-ray crystallography of N-terminal fragments (3.Dong L.M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A.

An intradomain interaction model has been suggested as a basis for these structural differences, with a postulated salt bridge between Arg-61 and Glu-255. In this model a salt bridge would not form in E3 or E2 because the Cys-112 changes the orientation of the Arg-61 side chain and makes it less accessible to Glu-255 interaction (3.Dong L.M. Wilson C.

Despite these advances toward elucidating the tertiary and quaternary structure of apoE, there are still many open questions. Progress has been impeded by the difficulty of using standard NMR and X-ray crystallography methods as apoE is a lipoprotein and requires lipid binding in order to maintain its physiological conformation. Even though FRET-based studies have proven to be a powerful approach to study the conformation of proteins, to date they have mainly focused on intracellular or on recombinant apoE or on apoE produced from non-CNS cell types (9.Xu Q.

In addition, because of its relative rarity in the human population, the conformation of the protective E2 allele has not been studied in as much detail as E3 and E4, and the quaternary structure of intracellular and secreted apoE particles is controversial. To address these questions, we have developed a novel FRET-flow cytometry system to study the conformation and intermolecular interactions of intracellular and secreted apoE isoforms with high resolution and sensitivity. We used this system to comparatively study the conformation of HEK- and astrocyte-produced apoE. We showed that the conformations and quaternary structures of the three isoforms differ, that the measured structure depends on the cell type of origin, and that these structural differences may be related to differences in lipidation. We designed a series of plasmids encoding the three apoE isoforms, with a GFP tag fused to the C terminus and an RFP 2The abbreviations used are: RFP, red fluorescent protein; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; PFA, paraformaldehyde; CM, conditioned medium; MB, Marina Blue 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; DiD, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate; eGFP, enhanced GFP; ANOVA, analysis of variance. 2The abbreviations used are: RFP, red fluorescent protein; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; PFA, paraformaldehyde; CM, conditioned medium; MB, Marina Blue 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine; DiD, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate; eGFP, enhanced GFP; ANOVA, analysis of variance. tag fused to the N terminus of the protein with an 18-amino acid secretion signal peptide before the RFP tag. Double-tagged proteins can be analyzed to monitor intramolecular FRET, and the results can be used as a proxy to infer the conformation status of apoE. A higher FRET ratio indicates higher energy transfer from GFP to RFP and occurs when the two termini of the protein are oriented in a way to support FRET, most likely because the two fluorophores are closer together (Fig. 1A). To assess the intracellular conformational differences between the apoE isoforms, we transiently transfected HEK cells and apoE knock-out (KO) primary immortalized astrocytes with one of each double-tagged apoE constructs. We also transfected cells with apoE singly tagged with either GFP or RFP, and these samples were used as single color controls for the FRET experiment. As a negative control, we co-transfected cells with RFP and GFP plasmids. In this condition, any apparent FRET detected is due to misexcitation or bleed-through in the fluorescence measurements, and it would be expected that true apoE FRET would be higher than that baseline level. As a positive control, we transfected cells with an RFP-GFP fusion plasmid, which we have previously demonstrated provides a strong FRET signal (17.Uemura K. Lill C.M. Li X. Peters J.A. Ivanov A.

The respective flow cytometry plots from representative samples from HEK cells are demonstrated in Fig. 1B. Previous work using similar FRET constructs in N2a cells (9.Xu Q. Brecht W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Apolipoprotein E4 domain interaction occurs in living neuronal cells as determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25511-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) showed that E4 had a closer conformation than E3. We confirmed these observations within both cell types studied (HEK cells and astrocytes); intracellular apoE isoforms exhibited different FRET ratios, with E2 < E3 < E4 (Fig. 1, C and D). We interpreted the results from this experiment to suggest that both within HEK cells and within astrocytes, the N and C termini of E4 are at close proximity (“closed” conformation), the termini of E2 are far apart (“open” conformation), and that E3 has an intermediate conformation. All isoforms exhibited FRET efficiency that was above the levels of the negative control RFP+GFP (Fig. 1, C and D). Earlier crystallography based models of recombinant N-terminal apoE suggested that apoE4 differs from apoE3 conformation in part because of the presence of a salt bridge between Arg-61 and Glu-255 and that mutation of Arg-61 abolishes this conformation, leading E4 to obtain a conformation resembling E3 (18.Raffai R.L. Dong L.M. Farese Jr, R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Introduction of human apolipoprotein E4 “domain interaction” into mouse apolipoprotein E.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 19Deleted in proof,Google Scholar). To test both this hypothesis in a cellular context and to further validate the conformational information derived from FRET measurements, we introduced the R61T mutation on the E4 background. In both HEK cells and astrocytes, the mutant E4 had FRET efficiency that was at levels similar to the E3 isoform (Fig. 1, C and D), consistent with the observation that the R61T mutation changes the properties of E4 to resemble E3. ApoE is a lipoprotein that is important for shuttling lipids among peripheral organs or among cells within the brain, and thus it is thought that the secreted form is functionally the most important. To study the conformation of the secreted protein, we transiently transfected HEK cells and immortalized astrocytes (genetically null for murine apoE) with the double-tagged apoE constructs. Secreted apoE particles are below 1 μm in size and are undetectable by standard flow cytometry; thus, attachment to Dynabeads of a 2.8-μm diameter was necessary to enable their detection (Fig. 2A). Attachment of the secreted apoE particles to the beads was confirmed by fluorescence-based sorting (Fig. 2B). FRET analysis through flow cytometry showed that HEK-secreted apoE isoforms exhibit a conformation pattern similar to the intracellular protein, with E2 having the most open conformation and E4 the most closed conformation (Fig. 2C). The conformation of astrocyte-secreted apoE differed, as E2 and E3 exhibited similar FRET efficiencies, whereas only E4 had a statistically significant higher FRET efficiency in comparison to E3 (Fig. 2D). In both cell lines, the E4 R61T mutant exhibited a decreased FRET level in comparison to wild-type E4, consistent with what had been observed for intracellular protein (Fig. 2, C and D). To confirm that the attachment of secreted apoE to the Dynabeads through the anti-GFP antibody does not alter its conformation, we repeated the same experiment using a goat polyclonal anti-apoE antibody (#AB947, Millipore), which gave a similar pattern of results (Fig. 2E). The double-tagged apoE molecules are designed to report intramolecular FRET, but the possibility that they also detect some signal from the interaction of two (double)-tagged apoEs cannot be ruled out. To directly examine whether apoE-apoE intermolecular interactions occur, we co-transfected HEK cells and astrocytes with single-tagged versions of the apoE plasmids of the same isoform with one tag placed either on the C or N terminus. We assessed the intermolecular interactions between C+C, N+C, and N+N termini using the following transfection combinations: apoE-RFP+apoE-GFP, RFP-apoE+apoE-GFP, and RFP-apoE+GFP-apoE at a 1:1 transfection ratio (Fig. 3A). The results from those experiments suggest that intracellular and secreted apoE produced from HEK cells and astrocytes displays intermolecular interactions (Fig. 3, B–D). They also indicate that the tertiary and quaternary structures of apoE particles substantially differ between isoforms. When comparing the interactions between corresponding combinations of the apoE termini, intermolecular FRET was higher for E4 and lower for E2, with E3 adopting intermediate FRET levels. In particular, E4 exhibited significantly stronger interactions between its C+C and N+C termini compared with E2 in all conditions studied. Intermolecular FRET was not a result of aggregation of apoE particles on the Dynabeads, as the FRET-positive population seen on the flow cytometry plots was tight and homogeneous (Fig. 3F). To further explore the nature of the intermolecular interactions, we cloned a plasmid encoding the E3 isoform with five mutations in the C-terminal region (“E3 5mutant”) that have been previously shown through biophysical experiments to diminish intermolecular interactions of apoE (20.Chen J. Li Q. Wang J. Topology of human apolipoprotein E3 uniquely regulates its diverse biological functions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 14813-14818Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we found that E3 5mutant does not form as strong C-terminal intermolecular interactions as the wild-type E3 within HEK cells and astrocytes and in HEK-secreted apoE (Fig. 3, G–I). However, astrocyte-secreted apoE behaved differently as there was a trend for stronger intermolecular interactions of the mutated isoform in comparison to wild-type E3 (Fig. 3J). These data support the interpretation that there are intermolecular interactions between wild-type apoE molecules but also reinforce the differential nature of apoE interactions under different cell conditions. It is widely accepted that secreted apoE is a lipoprotein and that its lipidation status is important for it to maintain its physiological structure (7.Hatters D.M. Peters-Libeu C.A. Weisgraber K.H.

However, studies of the lipidation status of brain-derived apoE have been challenging because of the low lipidation levels of centrally in comparison to liver-produced apoE (22.DeMattos R.B.

Int. 2001; 39: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, most studies to date have focused on the general lipid contents of the whole conditioned medium (CM) from cells producing a particular apoE isoform rather than on apoE-specific lipidation (23.Morikawa M.

Brendza R.P. Heuser J.E. Kierson M. Cirrito J.R. Fryer J. Sullivan P.M. Fagan A.M. Han X. Holtzman D.M.

Int. 2001; 39: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To study the lipidation of secreted apoE and to assess whether differences in lipidation correlate with conformational differences between apoE isoforms, we developed a novel flow cytometry-based lipidation assay. In this assay, we attached tagged apoE secreted from HEK cells or astrocytes to Dynabeads. We then incubated the Dynabeads with various lipid dyes followed by analysis through flow cytometry. We calculated the ratio of lipid content per apoE molecule by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the lipid dye to the MFI of the fluorophore tagged to apoE. As a first approach, we examined whether lipid dyes bound beads in an apoE-dependent fashion. We expressed GFP-tagged apoE and captured it on beads with an anti-GFP antibody, so that we could simultaneously determine the amount of apoE (i.e. GFP) and the amount of lipid dye on each bead. We assessed lipid content using the well-characterized lipid sensor, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate (DiD), which becomes fluorescent in the presence of lipids. With the ratios of protein to beads we used, in any given preparation, some beads contained detectable apoE fluorescence and others did not. Only a small proportion of Dynabeads was positive for apoE (supplemental Fig. S1). As expected, the MFI for DiD was significantly higher in the apoE(+) population in comparison to the apoE(−) population of beads (Fig. 4A), consistent with there being little nonspecific binding of the lipid dyes to the beads. This analysis showed that lipidation adopts a directional pattern for HEK- and astrocyte-secreted apoE with E4 being the most lipidated isoform, E2 being the least lipidated, and E3 having an intermediate lipidation content (Fig. 4B). In addition, the lipidation results were not dependent on whether the fluorescent tag was present on the N or C terminus of apoE (data not shown); thus, results from those experiments were pooled together for the meta-analysis. To develop methods to examine other classes of lipid dyes and to determine appropriate experimental conditions, we performed two lipidation gradient experiments. As a source of lipids, we used intact astrocyte cells that are known to express on their surface cholesterol and phospholipids in large quantities. These cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and the lipid gradient experiments were analyzed through flow cytometry. In the first experiment we used a stable concentration of DiD, Marina Blue 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (MB) (a phosphatidylethanolamine analogue), or filipin (a cholesterol lipid dye), and a serial dilution of cells. In the second experiment we used a stable concentration of cells and a serial dilution of lipid dye. These experiments showed that all three lipid dyes follow a linear dose-response curve (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). To assess whether the presence of the large fluorescent tags affects the lipidation status of apoE, we completed the lipidation experiments using apoE secreted from primary mouse immortalized astrocytes expressing human untagged E2, E3, and E4 (24.Hashimoto T. Serrano-Pozo A. Hori Y. Adams K.W. Takeda S. Banerji A.O. Mitani A. Joyner D. Thyssen D.H. Bacskai B.J. Frosch M.P. Spires-Jones T.L. Finn M.B. Holtzman D.M. Hyman B.T. Apolipoprotein E, especially apolipoprotein E4, increases the oligomerization of amyloid β peptide.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 15181-15192Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Secreted apoE was attached to Dynabeads using a polyclonal goat anti-apoE antibody. We expected, based on the GFP data, that only a minority of beads might contain apoE; to tag those beads and ascertain the concentrations of apoE on the beads, we then incubated with an antibody against the N terminus of apoE that was tagged with either DyLight594 or DyLight488, to complement the fluorescent properties of the lipid dyes. Finally, beads were incubated with the various lipid dyes. Flow cytometry analysis showed that apoE maintained its lipidation, with apoE(+) Dynabeads exhibiting much a higher lipid dye MFIs in comparison to apoE(−) Dynabeads (Fig. 4C). However, these assays showed less differential in lipid content among isoforms, with the pattern of E2 < E3 < E4 clear only for filipin. Lipidation patterns as determined with the DiD and MB dyes appeared to be not dependent on isoform (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that isoform-dependent lipidation measures are dependent on experimental conditions, consistent with previous literature showing discrepant results under different experimental circumstances. In this study we developed a novel system to study the conformation and interactions of intracellular and secreted apoE. We generated a series of plasmids encoding apoE with an RFP and a GFP tag on its N and C termini, respectively, placing a signal peptide before the N-terminal tag to ensure secretion of the double-tagged protein. Using this system we showed that the conformation of intracellular apoE adopts a directional pattern with E4 having the most closed conformation and E2 having the most open conformation. However, this pattern was not maintained upon secretion of apoE from astrocytes, in which condition the conformational differences between isoforms are diminished. We also showed that apoE molecules exhibit significant intermolecular interactions and that the structure of apoE particles is altered upon secretion, differs between isoforms, and is cell type-specific. Finally, we suggest that the extent of apoE lipidation can vary, dependent on cell, isoform, and experimental conditions. Our findings on the conformation of intracellular apoE are consistent with previous studies. We confirmed the conformation of intracellular E3 and E4, which has been previously described using CFP/YFP FRET assays either within N2A (neuronal) cells comparing E3 and E4 or on E3 and E4 in non-physiological systems (9.Xu Q.

https://openalex.org/W2727093975,"Macrophages use various cell-surface receptors to sense their environment and undergo polarized responses. The cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, released from T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells, drive macrophage polarization toward an alternatively activated phenotype (M2). This phenotype is associated with the expression of potent pro-resolving mediators, such as the prostaglandin (PG) D2-derived cyclopentenone metabolite, 15d-PGJ2, produced by the cyclooxygenase (Ptgs; Cox) pathway. Interestingly, IL-4 treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) significantly down-regulates Cox-2 protein expression, whereas Cox-1 levels are significantly increased. This phenomenon not only challenges the dogma that Cox-1 is only developmentally regulated, but also demonstrates a novel mechanism in which IL-4-dependent regulation of Cox-1 involves the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex (mTORC). Using specific chemical inhibitors, we demonstrate here that IL-4-dependent Cox-1 up-regulation occurs at the post-transcriptional level via the Fes-Akt-mTORC axis. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by metformin, inhibition of mTORC by torin 1, or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic knock-out of tuberous sclerosis complex-2 (Tsc2) blocked the IL-4-dependent expression of Cox-1 and the ability of macrophages to polarize to M2. However, use of 15d-PGJ2 partially rescued the effects of AMPK activation, suggesting the importance of Cox-1 in macrophage polarization as also observed in a model of gastrointestinal helminth clearance. In summary, these findings suggest a new paradigm where IL-4-dependent up-regulation of Cox-1 expression may play a key role in tissue homeostasis and wound healing during Th2-mediated immune responses, such as parasitic infections."

https://openalex.org/W2726891706,"In a previous phylogenetic study of the family of pyruvate kinase EC (2.7.1.40), a cluster with Glu117 and another with Lys117 were found (numbered according to the rabbit muscle enzyme). The sequences with Glu117 have been found to be K+-dependent, whereas those with Lys117 were K+-independent. Interestingly, only γ-proteobacteria exhibit sequences in both branches of the tree. In this context, it was explored whether these phylogenetically distinct pyruvate kinases were both expressed and contribute to the pyruvate kinase activity in Vibrio cholerae. The main findings of this work showed that the isozyme with Glu117 is an active K+-dependent enzyme. At the same substrate concentration, its Vmax in the absence of fructose 1,6 bisphosphate was 80% of that with its effector. This result is in accordance with the non-essential activation described by allosteric ligands for most pyruvate kinases. In contrast, the pyruvate kinase with Lys117 was a K+-independent enzyme displaying an allosteric activation by ribose 5-phosphate. At the same substrate concentration, its activity without the effector was 0.5% of the one obtained in the presence of ribose 5-phosphate, indicating that this sugar monophosphate is a strong activator of this enzyme. This absolute allosteric dependence is a novel feature of pyruvate kinase activity. Interestingly, in the K+-independent enzyme, Mn2+ may ""mimic"" the allosteric effect of Rib 5-P. Despite their different allosteric behavior, both isozymes display a rapid equilibrium random order kinetic mechanism. The intracellular concentrations of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and ribose 5-phosphate in Vibrio cholerae have been experimentally verified to be sufficient to induce maximal activation of both enzymes. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated that both enzymes were co-expressed. Therefore, it is concluded that VcIPK and VcIIPK contribute to the activity of pyruvate kinase in this γ-proteobacterium."

After a decade of productive cancer genome projects, few experts would question the role of genetics in human cancer. Yet environmental factors also contribute. One intriguing hypothesis is that carriers of certain genetic alterations develop cancer because they are less able to cope with environmental or endogenous carcinogens. Tan et al. identified a gene-environment interaction involving BRCA2, a protein that functions to maintain genomic integrity. Inherited mutations in one copy of BRCA2 confer susceptibility to several cancers, including breast cancer. The authors found that exposure of cultured cells to naturally occurring levels of formaldehyde or acetaldehyde induces selective degradation of wild-type BRCA2 protein. This could exacerbate the effect of heterozygous BRCA2 mutations and result in the accumulation of cancer-causing mutations.

As light propagates through a medium such as a lens or window, scattering and dispersion processes usually result in the light diffusing. In a nonlinear medium, however, the dispersion processes can be balanced by nonlinearities to produce localized structures known as solitons, or optical bullets. Krupa et al. find that when pairs of solitons propagate in an optic fiber, they can interact, attracting and repelling each other. Likening the interactions to those of molecules, the authors suggest that the temporal motion of the solitons and the energetics associated with the interactions could be exploited for new optical effects in different classes of laser systems. The enhanced interactions could also possibly be used to increase the capacity of optical communication networks.

Ejaculates not only deliver sperm; other components promote sperm survival and control female reproductive physiology. Insects produce complex ejaculates in packages called spermatophores, which also act as plugs to prevent sneaky mating by rival males. Meslin et al. discovered that spermatophores are the object of an evolutionary arms race in cabbage white butterflies. These plugs have tough outer proline-rich capsules, but the female butterflies have evolved a range of proteases that can digest them and thus hasten the time when she can become receptive again. This butterfly has taken back control of her reproduction.

Female cabbage white butterflies have evolved methods to break down spermatophore plugs, thus hijacking control of when they can mate again.

Flowers produce all kinds of cues that attract bees and alert them to the presence of nectar, indicating that bees are highly attuned to flower signals. But contrary to expectations, bees do not solely rely on flower signals to look for nectar. Meiners et al. found that bees' ability to find resources is likely much more flexible than we have realized. After observing large numbers of bees visiting nonflowering chamise shrubs, they discovered that 42 bee species were collecting honeydew produced by scale insects found on the shrubs. Bees also swiftly located sugar daubed on shrub limbs. As for how they locate an unadvertised resource such as honeydew, the authors suggest that they may be using social cues from other foraging bees.

Although filtration or distillation can desalinate water, these approaches can require large amounts of energy, great quantities of saline water, and extensive piping and distribution networks. They are thus impractical in a desert setting where extraction from the atmosphere is the primary source of water. Rieth et al. constructed a metal-organic framework (MOF) material that can pull 0.8 grams of water per gram of MOF from air at only 30% humidity, using the day-to-night temperature swing to drive adsorption and desorption. The key to the design was having pores wider than the critical diameter for capillary action to allow free flow of the water molecules.

Thanks to global warming, permafrost—soil that remains in part frozen throughout the year—is thawing across much the north, shifting ecosystems and potentially unlocking a vast pool of ancient carbon for slow release to the atmosphere, amplifying the greenhouse effect. Local influences like topography and the water content in the soil, however, prevent long-term field sites from extrapolating their results to the landscape at large. It9s hoped that the NASA project9s nine aircraft, armed with advanced laser altimeters and radar, will help knit these local measures into a broad tapestry portraying the Arctic9s future."

Tuberculosis is a slow disease. Replication of the pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis , can be arrested for decades within hypoxic tubercles. Eoh et al. show that hypoxia shifts the metabolism of M. tuberculosis into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by depleting stores of trehalose. This disaccharide is essential for the mycolyl glycolipids that wax the surface of the bacterium's cell. The PPP intermediates provide precursors for nucleotide and peptidoglycan synthesis. The pathogen is thus retuned during latency to poise it for immediate action when immunocompromise has crept up on the aging host; the tubercles start breaking down, and exposure to oxygen allows the pathogen to restart replication.
