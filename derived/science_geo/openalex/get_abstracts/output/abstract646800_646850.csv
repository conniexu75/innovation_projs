https://openalex.org/W3004345103,"Cortical organoids are self-organizing three-dimensional cultures that model features of the developing human cerebral cortex1,2. However, the fidelity of organoid models remains unclear3-5. Here we analyse the transcriptomes of individual primary human cortical cells from different developmental periods and cortical areas. We find that cortical development is characterized by progenitor maturation trajectories, the emergence of diverse cell subtypes and areal specification of newborn neurons. By contrast, organoids contain broad cell classes, but do not recapitulate distinct cellular subtype identities and appropriate progenitor maturation. Although the molecular signatures of cortical areas emerge in organoid neurons, they are not spatially segregated. Organoids also ectopically activate cellular stress pathways, which impairs cell-type specification. However, organoid stress and subtype defects are alleviated by transplantation into the mouse cortex. Together, these datasets and analytical tools provide a framework for evaluating and improving the accuracy of cortical organoids as models of human brain development."

The profound effects of tobacco on the genome of lung cancer cells are well-documented6-10, but equivalent data for normal bronchial cells are lacking. Here we sequenced whole genomes of 632 colonies derived from single bronchial epithelial cells across 16 subjects. Tobacco smoking was the major influence on mutational burden, typically adding from 1,000 to 10,000 mutations per cell; massively increasing the variance both within and between subjects; and generating several distinct mutational signatures of substitutions and of insertions and deletions. A population of cells in individuals with a history of smoking had mutational burdens that were equivalent to those expected for people who had never smoked: these cells had less damage from tobacco-specific mutational processes, were fourfold more frequent in ex-smokers than current smokers and had considerably longer telomeres than their more-mutated counterparts. Driver mutations increased in frequency with age, affecting 4-14% of cells in middle-aged subjects who had never smoked. In current smokers, at least 25% of cells carried driver mutations and 0-6% of cells had two or even three drivers. Thus, tobacco smoking increases mutational burden, cell-to-cell heterogeneity and driver mutations, but quitting promotes replenishment of the bronchial epithelium from mitotically quiescent cells that have avoided tobacco mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3003439637,"ATP13A2 (PARK9) is a late endolysosomal transporter that is genetically implicated in a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, including Kufor-Rakeb syndrome—a parkinsonism with dementia1—and early-onset Parkinson’s disease2. ATP13A2 offers protection against genetic and environmental risk factors of Parkinson’s disease, whereas loss of ATP13A2 compromises lysosomes3. However, the transport function of ATP13A2 in lysosomes remains unclear. Here we establish ATP13A2 as a lysosomal polyamine exporter that shows the highest affinity for spermine among the polyamines examined. Polyamines stimulate the activity of purified ATP13A2, whereas ATP13A2 mutants that are implicated in disease are functionally impaired to a degree that correlates with the disease phenotype. ATP13A2 promotes the cellular uptake of polyamines by endocytosis and transports them into the cytosol, highlighting a role for endolysosomes in the uptake of polyamines into cells. At high concentrations polyamines induce cell toxicity, which is exacerbated by ATP13A2 loss due to lysosomal dysfunction, lysosomal rupture and cathepsin B activation. This phenotype is recapitulated in neurons and nematodes with impaired expression of ATP13A2 or its orthologues. We present defective lysosomal polyamine export as a mechanism for lysosome-dependent cell death that may be implicated in neurodegeneration, and shed light on the molecular identity of the mammalian polyamine transport system. The lysosomal polyamine transporter ATP13A2 controls the cellular polyamine content, and impaired lysosomal polyamine export represents a lysosome-dependent cell death pathway that may be implicated in ATP13A2-associated neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W3003704799,"Glioblastoma is a universally lethal form of brain cancer that exhibits an array of pathophysiological phenotypes, many of which are mediated by interactions with the neuronal microenvironment1,2. Recent studies have shown that increases in neuronal activity have an important role in the proliferation and progression of glioblastoma3,4. Whether there is reciprocal crosstalk between glioblastoma and neurons remains poorly defined, as the mechanisms that underlie how these tumours remodel the neuronal milieu towards increased activity are unknown. Here, using a native mouse model of glioblastoma, we develop a high-throughput in vivo screening platform and discover several driver variants of PIK3CA. We show that tumours driven by these variants have divergent molecular properties that manifest in selective initiation of brain hyperexcitability and remodelling of the synaptic constituency. Furthermore, secreted members of the glypican (GPC) family are selectively expressed in these tumours, and GPC3 drives gliomagenesis and hyperexcitability. Together, our studies illustrate the importance of functionally interrogating diverse tumour phenotypes driven by individual, yet related, variants and reveal how glioblastoma alters the neuronal microenvironment. Glioblastoma tumours expressing oncogenic PIK3CA variants secrete the glycan GPC3, which promotes the formation of neural synapses, brain synaptic hyperexcitability and gliomagenesis."

Here, we investigated the performance of the circRNA hsa_circ_0001445 as a biomarker of coronary artery disease (CAD) in a real-world clinical practice setting. Plasma hsa_circ_0001445 was measured in a study population of 200 consecutive patients with suspected stable CAD who had undergone coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Multivariable logistic models were constructed combining conventional risk factors with established biomarkers and hsa_circ_0001445. Model robustness was internally validated by the bootstrap technique. Biomarker accuracy was evaluated using the C-index. The integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) were also calculated. Risk groups were developed via classification tree models. The stability of plasma hsa_circ_0001445 was evaluated under different clinical conditions. hsa_circ_0001445 levels were associated with higher coronary atherosclerosis extent and severity with a 2-fold increase across tertiles (28.4%-50.0%). Levels of hsa_circ_0001445 were proportional to coronary atherosclerotic burden, even after comprehensive adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, medications, and established biomarkers (fully adjusted OR = 0.432 for hsa_circ_0001445 as a continuous variable and fully adjusted OR = 0.277 for hsa_circ_0001445 as a binary variable). The classification of patients was improved with the incorporation of hsa_circ_0001445 into a base clinical model (CM) composed of conventional cardiovascular risk factors, showing an IDI of 0.047 and NRI of 0.482 for hsa_circ_0001445 as a continuous variable and an IDI of 0.056 and NRI of 0.373 for hsa_circ_0001445 as a binary variable. A trend toward higher discrimination capacity was also observed (C-indexCM  = 0.833, C-indexCM+continuous hsa_circ_0001445  = 0.856 and C-indexCM+binary hsa_circ_0001445  = 0.855). Detailed analysis of stability showed that hsa_circ_0001445 was present in plasma in a remarkably stable form. In vitro, hsa_circ_0001445 was downregulated in extracellular vesicles secreted by human coronary smooth muscle cells upon exposure to atherogenic conditions. In patients with suspected stable CAD referred for coronary CTA, plasma hsa_circ_0001445 improves the identification of coronary artery atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W3004362203,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an ancient and evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway involved in numerous physiological processes. Despite great advances in understanding MAPK-mediated regulation of adaptive immune responses in mammals, its contribution to T-cell immunity in early vertebrates remains unclear. Herein, we used Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) to investigate the regulatory roles of MAPK/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk) signaling in ancestral T-cell immunity of jawed fish. We found that Nile tilapia possesses an evolutionarily conserved MAPK/Erk axis that is activated through a classical three-tier kinase cascade, involving sequential phosphorylation of RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase (Raf), MAPK/Erk kinase 1/2 (Mek1/2), and Erk1/2. In Nile tilapia, MAPK/Erk signaling participates in adaptive immune responses during bacterial infection. Upon T-cell activation, the MAPK/Erk axis is robustly activated, and MAPK/Erk blockade by specific inhibitors severely impairs T-cell activation. Furthermore, signals from MAPK/Erk were indispensable for primordial T cells to proliferate and exert their effector functions. Mechanistically, activation of the MAPK/Erk axis promoted glycolysis via induction of the transcriptional regulator proto-oncogene c-Myc (c-Myc), to ensure the proper activation and proliferation of fish T cells. Our results reveal the regulatory mechanisms of MAPK/Erk signaling in T-cell immunity in fish and highlight a close link between immune signals and metabolic programs. We propose that regulation of T-cell immunity by MAPK/Erk is a basic and sophisticated strategy that evolved before the emergence of the tetrapod lineage. These findings shed light on the evolution of the adaptive immune system."
https://openalex.org/W3004191854,"Insects face diverse biotic and abiotic stresses that can affect their survival. Many of these stressors impact cellular metabolism, often resulting in increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consequently, insects will respond to these stressors by increasing antioxidant activity and increased production of heat shock proteins (HSPs). In this study, the effect of heat, cold, starvation, and parasitism by Habroacon hebetor wasps was examined in the carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae, to determine which responses were common to different stresses. For all stressors, malondialdehyde levels increased, indicative of oxidative stress in the insects. The activity of two antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), increased with each stress, suggesting that these enzymes were serving a protective role for the insects. Heat (46°C for 100 min) and cold (-15°C for 30 min) treatments caused significant mortalities to all developmental stages, but pretreatments of moderate heat (37°C for 10 min) or cold (10°C for 10 min) induced thermotolerance and reduced the mortality rates when insects were subsequently exposed to lethal temperatures. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that heat and cold tolerance were associated with up-regulation of two HSPs, HSP70 and HSP90. Interestingly, HSP70 transcripts increased to a greater extent with cold treatment, while HSP90 transcripts increased more in response to high temperatures. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of either HSP70 or HSP90 transcripts was achieved by injecting larvae with dsRNA targeting each gene’s transcripts, and resulted in a loss of acquired thermotolerance in insects subjected to the heat or cold pretreatments. These observations provide convincing evidence that both HSP70 and HSP90 are important mediators of the acquired thermotolerance. Starvation and parasitism by wasps caused differential expression of the HSP genes. In response to starvation, HSP90 transcripts increased to a greater extent than HSP70, while in contrast, HSP70 transcripts increased to a greater extent than those of HSP90 during the first 48 h of wasp parasitism. These results showed the differential induction of the two HSPs’ transcripts with variable stresses. As well as, heat, cold, starvation, and parasitism induce oxidative stress, and antioxidant enzymes likely play an important role in reducing oxidative damage in E. ceratoniae."
https://openalex.org/W3004329522,"In this study, the Pb2+ biosorption potential of live and dead biosorbents of the hydrocarbon-degrading strain Rhodococcus sp. HX-2 was analyzed. Optimal biosorption conditions were determined via single factor optimization, which were as follows: temperature, 25°C; pH, 5.0, and biosorbent dose, 0.75 g L-1. A response surface software (Design Expert 10.0) was used to analyze optimal biosorption conditions. The biosorption data for live and dead biosorbents were suitable for the Freundlich model at a Pb2+ concentration of 200 mg L-1. At this same concentration, the maximum biosorption capacity was 88.74 mg g-1 (0.428 mmol g-1) for live biosorbents and 125.5 mg g-1 (0.606 mmol g-1) for dead biosorbents. Moreover, in comparison with the pseudo-first-order model, the pseudo-second-order model seemed better to depict the biosorption process. Dead biosorbents seemed to have lower binding strength than live biosorbents, showing a higher desorption capacity at pH 1.0. The order of influence of competitive metal ions on Pb2+ adsorption was Cu2+ > Cd2+ > Ni+. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses revealed that several functional groups were involved in the biosorption process of dead biosorbents. Scanning electron microscopy showed that Pb2+ attached to the surface of dead biosorbents more readily than on the surface of live biosorbents, whereas transmission electron microscopy confirmed the transfer of biosorbed Pb2+ into the cells in the case of both live and dead biosorbents. It can thus be concluded that dead biosorbents are better than live biosorbents for Pb2+ biosorption, and they can accordingly be used for wastewater treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3003984240,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, and its pathogenesis is associated with accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Aβ is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) that is sequentially cleaved by β- and γ-secretases. Therefore, APP processing has been a target in therapeutic strategies for managing AD; however, no effective treatment of AD patients is currently available. Here, to identify endogenous factors that modulate Aβ production, we performed a gene microarray–based transcriptome analysis of neuronal cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, because Aβ production in these cells changes during neuronal differentiation. We found that expression of the glycophosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1 (GPLD1) gene is associated with these changes in Aβ production. GPLD1 overexpression in HEK293 cells increased the secretion of galectin 3–binding protein (GAL3BP), which suppressed Aβ production in an AD model, neuroglioma H4 cells. Mechanistically, GAL3BP suppressed Aβ production by directly interacting with APP and thereby inhibiting APP processing by β-secretase. Furthermore, we show that cells take up extracellularly added GAL3BP via endocytosis and that GAL3BP is localized in close proximity to APP in endosomes where amyloidogenic APP processing takes place.

A large part of the N-terminal portion of APP is shed from the cell membrane after α-cleavage, and the fragment is called sAPPα. APP is shuttled to the plasma membrane from the trans-Golgi network, processed first by α-secretases and then by γ-secretases for the nonamyloidogenic pathway. On the other hand, for the amyloidogenic pathway, APP that escaped from α-cleavage is brought back from the cell surface to acidic early endosomes, where β- and γ-secretases sequentially cleave APP to produce amyloidogenic Aβ40 and Aβ42 (11Arbor S.

We previously found that production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42, as well as the ratio of Aβ40/42, are changed during neuronal differentiation of iPS cells (19Yahata N. Asai M. Kitaoka S. Takahashi K. Asaka I. Hioki H. Kaneko T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Nakahata T. Asada T. Yamanaka S. Iwata N. Inoue H.

These findings strongly suggest the possibility that there are some factors that regulate β- and/or γ-cleavage of APP, and in this study, we searched for such factors that could be a therapeutic target in AD. We previously reported that neuronal cells that are differentiated from human iPS (hiPS) cells express APP and secrete Aβ into the culture medium (19Yahata N. Asai M. Kitaoka S. Takahashi K. Asaka I. Hioki H. Kaneko T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Nakahata T. Asada T. Yamanaka S. Iwata N. Inoue H.

When the expression of APP and the ratio Aβ42/40 of the secreted proteins were measured at days 38, 45, and 52 during differentiation, both APP expression and the secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 at days 45 and 52 were significantly increased compared with those at day 38 (19Yahata N. Asai M. Kitaoka S. Takahashi K. Asaka I. Hioki H. Kaneko T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Nakahata T. Asada T. Yamanaka S. Iwata N. Inoue H.

Additionally, the expression of BACE1 was also increased at days 45 and 52 compared with day 38 (19Yahata N. Asai M. Kitaoka S. Takahashi K. Asaka I. Hioki H. Kaneko T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C.

Interestingly, the ratio of Aβ42/40 was dramatically reduced at days 45 and 52 compared with that at day 38 (19Yahata N. Asai M. Kitaoka S. Takahashi K. Asaka I. Hioki H. Kaneko T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Nakahata T. Asada T. Yamanaka S. Iwata N. Inoue H.

We hypothesized that transcriptional changes during the differentiation into neuronal cells may affect APP production and/or processing independently of the increased BACE1 expression. To test this hypothesis, we performed microarray analyses using three independent neuronal cell cultures that were differentiated from each of three hiPS cells, namely 201B7, 253G4, and AD4F-1 (nine cell lines in total; Fig. 1a). Total RNA was prepared at three differentiation time points (days 38, 45, and 52) and subjected to an Affymetrix Gene Chip Human Exon 1.0 ST array. The principal component analysis showed a unique pattern among the three groups of the hiPS cell lines 201B7 (red), 253G4 (blue), and AD4F-1 (green) (Fig. S1). Next, we examined genes showing common expressional changes among these three groups during the differentiation. In particular, we focused on genes differentially expressed before and after the drastic changes in APP expression, Aβ production, and the ratio of Aβ42/40 (i.e. comparison between samples from 38-day cultures and samples from 45- and 52-day cultures) using the Partek Genomics Suite software. A total of 316 genes showing an at least 1.3-fold expressional change with statistical significance (p < 0.05) were detected as candidates correlated with the changes in Aβ production and the Aβ42/40 ratio (Table S1). Among these genes, we particularly paid attention to GPLD1 encoding glycophosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1, which cleaves the inositol phosphate linkage in proteins modified with a GPI anchor (21Scallon B.J. Fung W.J. Tsang T.C. Li S. Kado-Fong H. Huang K.S. Kochan J.P. Primary structure and function activity of a phosphatidylinositol-glycan-specific phospholipase D.Science. 1991; 252 (2017684): 446-44810.1126/science.2017684Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Deeg M.A. Bierman E.L.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42 (11254757): 442-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because Aβ is produced from APP in lipid rafts where GPI-anchored proteins are associated (23Maeda Y. Tashima Y. Houjou T. Fujita M. Yoko-o T. Jigami Y. Taguchi R. Kinoshita T. Fatty acid remodeling of GPI-anchored proteins is required for their raft association.Mol. Biol.

Thus, we hypothesized that GPLD1 regulates intracellular trafficking and/or localization into lipid rafts of GPI-anchored proteins, and these changes may affect APP processing or, alternatively, that GPLD1 cleaves GPI-anchored proteins, and the resulting products may regulate Aβ production/accumulation in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Gene expression data showed a significant up-regulation of GPLD1 in all three hiPS cell–derived neuronal cells (Fig. 1b). Thus, we examined whether overexpression or knockdown of GPLD1 affects Aβ production in the human neuroglioma H4 cell that stably expresses APP with the Swedish mutation (H4-APPsw) (25Citron M. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Teplow D.B. Miller C. Schenk D. Johnston J. Winblad B. Venizelos N. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Excessive production of amyloid β-protein by peripheral cells of symptomatic and presymptomatic patients carrying the Swedish familial Alzheimer disease mutation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91 (7991571): 11993-1199710.1073/pnas.91.25.11993Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe significant changes in the production of either Aβ42 or Aβ40 after overexpression or knockdown via RNAi (Fig. 2 (a and b) and Fig. S2). The ratio of Aβ42/40 was also unchanged (Fig. 2c). We hypothesized that some factors involved in the GPLD1-induced modulation of the Aβ production are not sufficiently expressed in the H4 cell line. HEK293 cells have often been used to study APP processing and Aβ production (26Hasegawa H. Liu L. Tooyama I. Murayama S. Nishimura M. The FAM3 superfamily member ILEI ameliorates Alzheimer's disease-like pathology by destabilizing the penultimate amyloid-β precursor.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (24894631): 391710.1038/ncomms4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and also are known to express a wide range of membrane-bound and secreted proteins (27Ooi A. Wong A. Esau L. Lemtiri-Chlieh F. Gehring C. A guide to transient expression of membrane proteins in HEK-293 cells for functional characterization.Front. Physiol. 2016; 7 (27486406): 30010.3389/fphys.2016.00300Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we transfected GPLD1 into HEK293 cells, collected the conditioned media, and added these HEK293-conditioned media to H4-APPsw cell cultures to investigate changes in Aβ production. Surprisingly, productions of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 were significantly reduced by replacing the H4-APPsw media with the HEK293-conditioned media with or even without GPLD1 expression (Fig. 2, d and e). The effect on the reduction of Aβ production was more efficient with GPLD1 overexpression, although the ratio of Aβ42/40 remained unchanged in all conditions (Fig. 2f). We also transfected GPLD1 into HEK293 cells that stably expressed APPsw (HEK293-APPsw cells) and confirmed that the production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 was reduced significantly in HEK293-APPsw–conditioned media (Fig. S3). To identify the factors that can inhibit Aβ production in the conditioned media from GPLD1-expressing HEK293 cells, we first concentrated the conditioned media using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters with a 30-kDa molecular mass cutoff. The concentrated but not the flow-through fractions decreased the production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. 3a). Because extracellular domains of membrane-bound or secreted proteins are often modified with glycans, we thought that lectin affinity beads could capture the suppressive factors. We therefore applied the concentrated fractions to several beads conjugated to lectins, namely wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFL), concanavalin A (ConA), Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECA), and Vicia villosa lectin (VVA), to examine whether any of them can capture the suppressive factors. The suppressive activities were detected in the flow-through fractions of WGA-, ConA-, ECA-, and VVA-beads, but not in the flow-through fractions of WFL-beads (Fig. 3b). The eluted fraction from WFL-beads with GalNAc suppressed the Aβ production in H4-APPsw cells (Fig. 3c). We applied the WFL elution to ion-exchange columns, and the bound proteins were recovered with stepwise NaCl elution. The fraction eluted with 0.5 m NaCl exhibited suppressive activities (Fig. 3d). Silver staining showed a unique band around the molecular mass of 90 kDa in the samples purified from the conditioned media of GPLD1-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 3e). Mass spectrometry analysis identified that this band corresponds to the human GAL3BP (Fig. 3e and Table S2). Western blot analysis showed that the amount of GAL3BP protein decreased in cell lysates and increased in the culture media following the overexpression of GPLD1 (Fig. 3f). RT-PCR analysis showed no obvious changes in the expression of GAL3BP mRNA in HEK293 cells with or without GPLD1 overexpression (Fig. S4). These data suggest that HEK293 cells endogenously secrete GAL3BP and that overexpression of GPLD1 increases the amount of secreted GAL3BP (Fig. 3f). We also confirmed that H4-APPsw cells do not express detectable amounts of GAL3BP in either cell lysates or culture media (Fig. S5), which may explain the absence of detectable change in Aβ production in H4-APPsw cells despite GPLD1 overexpression (Fig. 2). Although the reasons for the relatively weak inhibitory activities in the fractions purified later compared with the concentrated fractions are unknown, the inhibitory activities may have been partially lost during purification. Moreover, the concentrated fractions may possibly contain factors other than GAL3BP with protective effects on APP processing. Another possible explanation for its weak activity in WFL elution fractions (Fig. 3c) could be the presence of GalNAc, an ingredient of WFL elution buffer, which inhibits the activity of GAL3BP on Aβ production in H4-APPsw cells (Fig. S6). To confirm whether GAL3BP possesses the suppressive activity on Aβ production, we first transfected GAL3BP cDNA in H4-APPsw cells. Overexpression of GAL3BP inhibited the production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. 4a). Next, we knocked down GAL3BP in HEK293 cells via RNAi and added these conditioned media to H4-APPsw cell culture. Fig. 4b shows that knockdown of endogenous GAL3BP in HEK293 cells increased the production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42, indicating that the suppressive activity of the Aβ production was attenuated. Furthermore, when GAL3BP was knocked down in HEK293 cells, overexpression of GPLD1 had no effect on Aβ production (Fig. 4b and Fig. S7), suggesting that GAL3BP acts as a downstream factor of GPLD1. Finally, the addition of recombinant GAL3BP protein into H4-APPsw cell culture media decreased the production of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. 4c). Because recombinant GAL3BP preparations contain other contaminating proteins, we also used commercially available GAL3BP purified from a mouse myeloma cell line (Fig. S8). The commercially available GAL3BP also exhibited a similar inhibitory activity on Aβ production without changing cell viability. (Fig. 4d and Fig. S9). We also tested the effects of GAL3BP on Aβ production in H4 cells that stably express WT APP (H4-APPwt). The results show around 30% suppression of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. S10). The suppressive activity of the Aβ production by GAL3BP was also observed in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. S11). These data indicate that GAL3BP can modulate Aβ production via autocrine/paracrine-like actions. The transmembrane protease BACE1 cleaves APP and produces a soluble extracellular fragment (i.e. sAPPβ) and APP-βCTF, which in turn is processed by γ-secretase to Aβ. Alternatively, APP is processed by the α-secretase, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), which produces nonamyloidogenic sAPPα and p3 fragments (11Arbor S. Targeting amyloid precursor protein shuttling and processing—long before amyloid β formation.Neural Regen. Res. 2017; 12 (28400797): 207-20910.4103/1673-5374.200800Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 12Arbor S.C. LaFontaine M. Cumbay M. Amyloid-β Alzheimer targets—protein processing, lipid rafts, and amyloid-β pores.Yale J. Biol. Med. 2016; 89 (27505013): 5-21PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, suppression of Aβ production by GAL3BP may be associated with changes in expression and/or activities of BACE1 or ADAM10. We therefore examined the sAPPα and sAPPβ levels in conditioned media of H4-APPsw cells with or without the addition of commercially available GAL3BP. Western blotting and ELISA show that the secretion of sAPPβ was reduced in the presence of GAL3BP, whereas the sAPPα levels were not changed (Fig. 5, a–c). In addition, the amount of intracellular βCTF significantly reduced after treatment with commercially available GAL3BP (Fig. 5, a–c). ELISA indicated no obvious intracellular accumulation of Aβ after GAL3BP treatments (Fig. 5d). The expression levels of BACE1 and ADAM10 were not altered by the addition of GAL3BP (Fig. 5e). These data indicate that GAL3BP affects the amyloidogenic APP processing pathway, possibly via inhibition of BACE1 activity. Thus, we tested whether GAL3BP modulates the enzyme activity of BACE1. BACE1 activity was measured in the presence of the purified recombinant GAL3BP fractions in vitro, and the results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of GAL3BP on BACE1 activity (Fig. S12a). A similar inhibitory effect on BACE1 activity was observed with the commercially available GAL3BP (Fig. S12, b and c). A possible mechanism for the inhibition of BACE1 activity by GAL3BP could be direct interaction; however, thus far, we could not detect any direct interaction between them. Instead, we hypothesized that GAL3BP may bind to the substrates of BACE1 and thus protect BACE1-dependent processing. However, the identity of the substrate used in the β-secretase assay kit is proprietary information. Thus, we performed an in vitro BACE1 assay using immunoprecipitated APP proteins as the substrate. As shown in Fig. 6 (a and b), the amount of full-length immunoprecipitated APP proteins decreased in the presence of BACE1, and the addition of the commercially available GAL3BP prevented such decreases. Accordingly, the production of APP-βCTF was suppressed in the presence of GAL3BP (Fig. 6, a and b). The aforementioned decreases of the full-length APP proteins and protective effects on the production of APP-βCTF were also observed when BACE1 inhibitor was used (Fig. 6, c and d), supporting the specificity of GAL3BP on the inhibition of BACE1. Subsequently, we incubated the immunoprecipitated APP proteins with commercially available GAL3BP to observe direct protein-protein interaction. The results showed that GAL3BP bound to immunoprecipitated APP–anti-APP antibody/protein A–beads, but not to the nonimmunoglobulin/protein A–beads (Fig. 6e). Moreover, GAL3BP and APP were co-immunoprecipitated from the GAL3BP-overexpressing H4-APPsw cells (Fig. 6f). These data suggest an interaction between GAL3BP and APP, which suppresses BACE1-dependent APP processing and consequent Aβ production, possibly via physical protection of BACE1 accessibility to the β-cut site. Detailed interaction sites should be investigated in the future. The addition of the commercially available GAL3BP to the H4-APPsw culture media did not affect the processing of NRG1, another substrate of BACE1, whereas the addition of BACE1 inhibitor, which directly binds to the active site of BACE1, increased the amount of full-length NRG1 (Fig. 6, g and h). These data may suggest a selective suppression of APP processing by GAL3BP through direct interaction. Finally, we examined whether the extracellularly added GAL3BP can be taken up by the cells. H4-APPsw cells treated with or without the recombinant GAL3BP were immunosta"

We identified 102,076 men in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden 4.0 who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006–2016. Risk of metastases was assessed for PSA stratified on T stage and five-tiered GGG. For men who had not undergone bone imaging, we used multiple imputation to classify metastatic prostate cancer. Advanced T stage, high GGG and high PSA were related to bone metastases. For example: only 79/38 190 (0.2%) of men with T1-2 and GGG 1 had PSA above 500 ng/mL, and 29/79 (44%) of these men had metastases; whereas 1 154/7 018 (16%) of men with T3-4 and GGG 5 had PSA above 500 ng/ml and 1 088/1 154 (94%) of these men had metastases. However, no PSA cut-off could accurately identify the majority of men with metastatic prostate cancer (i.e. high sensitivity) while also correctly classifying most men without metastasis (i.e. high specificity). In conclusion, these results support the use of imaging to confirm bone metastases in men with advanced prostate cancer as no PSA level in combination with T stage and GGG could accurately rule in metastatic prostate cancer and thereby safely omit bone imaging."

Therefore, we aimed to identify and characterize relevant subgroups of the HNHC population in primary care by using demographic, biomedical, and socioeconomic patient characteristics. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study within a Dutch primary care group, with a follow-up period from September 1, 2014 to August 31, 2017. Chronically ill patients were included in the HNHC population if they belonged to the top 10% of care utilizers and/or suffered from multimorbidity and had an above-average care utilization. In a latent class analysis, forty-one patient characteristics were initially used as potential indicators of heterogeneity in HNHC patients’ needs. Results Patient data from 12 602 HNHC patients was used. A 4-class model was considered statistically and clinically superior. The classes were named according to the characteristics that were most dominantly present and distinctive between the classes (i.e. mainly age, household position, and source of income). Class 1 (‘older adults living with partner’) included 39.3% of patients, class 2 (‘older adults living alone’) included 25.5% of patients, class 3 (‘middle-aged, employed adults with family’) included 23.3% of patients, and class 4 (‘middle-aged adults with social welfare dependency’) included 11.9% of patients. Diabetes was the most common condition in all classes; the second most prevalent condition differed between osteoarthritis in class 1 (21.7%) and 2 (23.8%), asthma in class 3 (25.3%), and mood disorders in class 4 (23.1%). Furthermore, while general practitioner (GP) care utilization increased during the follow-up period in the classes of older adults, it remained relatively stable in the middle-aged classes. Conclusions Although the HNHC population is heterogeneous, distinct subgroups with relatively homogeneous patterns of mainly demographic and socioeconomic characteristics can be identified. This calls for tailoring care and increased attention for social determinants of health."
https://openalex.org/W3003430121,"Recent studies have demonstrated the implication of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. However, the majority of lncRNAs are functionally unknown. The current study describes that the lncRNA MALAT1 regulates TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway through formation of a lncRNA-protein complex containing Smads, SETD2 and PPM1A. Our data show that this lncRNA-proteins complex facilitates the dephosphorylation of pSmad2/3 by providing the interaction niche for pSmad2/3 and their specific phosphatase PPM1A, thus terminating TGF-β/Smad signaling in hepatic cells. Based on these mechanistic studies, we performed further experiments to determine whether depletion of MALAT1 would augment cellular TGF-β/Smad signaling. We observed that MALAT1 depletion enhanced TGF-β/Smad signaling response, as reflect by amplification of Smad-mediated differentiation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to hepatocytes. Our experimental results demonstrate an important role of MALAT1 for regulation of TGF-β/Smad signaling in hepatic cells. Given the diverse functions of TGF-β/Smad pathway in various physiological and pathogenic processes, our results described in the current study will have broad implications for further understanding the role of MALAT1 in TGF-β/Smad pathway in human biology and disease."

Although inflammation directed nucleus pulposus (NP) extracellular matrix metabolism dysregulation is known to be the main cause of the degeneration process, few is known about the protective factors. Using high-throughput label-free proteomics, we found that inflammation-related autocrine factor Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1, or YKL-40) is highly expressed in the NP cells during degeneration. Immunohistochemical analysis show that the expression of CHI3L1 is NP tissue specific, and increase significantly during degeneration. Overexpression of CHI3L1 significantly decrease the catabolism, and increase the anabolism of extracellular matrix. Knockdown of CHI3L1 using siRNAs show the opposite results, which imply that the protective role of CHI3L1 in IDD. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing and functional analyses, we find that AKT3 expression and its phosphorylation is mainly regulated by CHI3L1. And lastly, the mechanism of which is also validated using human and mouse degenerated NP tissues. In summary, our findings show that the inflammation-related autocrine factor CHI3L1 is NP specific, and it protects IDD by promoting the AKT3 signaling, which may serve as a potential therapeutic target in intervertebral disc degeneration."

https://openalex.org/W3004259806,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors, with insulin resistance as a critical component for its development. Insulin signaling in the heart leads to Akt (also known as PKB) activation, a serine/threonine protein kinase, which regulates cardiac glucose metabolism and growth. Cardiac metabolic inflexibility, characterized by impaired insulin-induced glucose uptake and oxidation, has been reported as an early and consistent change in the heart of different models of MetS and diabetes; however, the evaluation of Akt activation has yielded variable results. Here we report in cardiomyocytes of MetS rats, diminished insulin-induced glucose uptake and Akt activation, evaluated by its impaired mobilization towards the plasma membrane and phosphorylation, and reflected in a re-distribution of its interacting proteins, assessed by label-free mass spectrometry (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD013260). We report 45 proteins with diminished abundance in Akt complex of MetS cardiomyocytes, mainly represented by energy metabolism-related proteins, and also, 31 Akt-interacting proteins with increased abundance, which were mainly related to contraction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and Akt negative regulation. These results emphasize the relevance of Akt in the regulation of energy metabolism in the heart and highlight Akt-interacting proteins that could be involved in the detrimental effects of MetS in the heart."

Some of these aim to rescue the remaining beta cells from autoimmune attack caused by the disease. Among the strategies employed, p53 has been envisaged as a possible target for immunomodulation. We studied the possible effect of p53 activation on Treg subsets and Treg/Teff balance in type 1 diabetes patients’ PBMC. Upon p53 activation, we observed an increase in CD8+ Treg and activated CD8+ Teff whilst CD8+ Teff cells significantly decreased in healthy PBMC when stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28. No effect was detected on percentages of CD4+ Treg, while a reduction was seen in CD4+ Teff cells and an increase in activated CD4+ Teff cells. In patients’ PBMC, upon p53 activation followed by 6 days of anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, CD8+ Treg and activated CD8+ Teff were increased while CD8+ Teff were decreased. No differences were detected in the CD4+ counterparts. CD8+ Teff PD1+, CD8+ Teff PD1low were increased upon p53 activation in type 1 diabetics compared to controls while CD8+ Teff PD1high were increased in both groups. The same increased percentages were detected for CD4+ counterparts. CD4+ Treg PD1high cells were decreased in diabetics upon p53 activation at day 6 of anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation. In conclusion, a Teff dysregulation is observed upon p53 activation suggesting that molecules promoting p53 cannot be used for therapy in type 1 diabetics."

Methods In this retrospective study, 1,420 patients with chest pain or angina equivalent were studied. Only men between 18 and 40 years and women between 18 and 50 years of age without history of cardiac disease were included. All patients were queried about current or prior cannabis use and underwent coronary CT angiography. Each coronary artery on coronary CT angiography was assessed based on the CAD-RADS reporting system. Results A total of 146 (10.3%) out of 1,420 patients with chest pain were identified as marijuana users. Only 6.8% of the 146 marijuana users had evidence of coronary artery disease on coronary CT angiography. In comparison, the rate was 15.0% among the 1,274 marijuana nonusers (p = 0.008). After accounting for other cardiac risk factors in a multivariate analysis, the negative association between marijuana use and coronary artery disease on coronary CT angiography diminished (p = 0.12, 95% CI 0.299–1.15). A majority of marijuana users were younger than nonusers and had a lower frequency of hypertension and diabetes than nonusers. There was no statistical difference in lipid panel values between the two groups. Only 2 out of 10 marijuana users with coronary artery disease on coronary CT angiography had hemodynamically significant stenosis. Conclusion Among younger patients being evaluated for chest pain, self-reported cannabis use conferred no additional risk of coronary artery disease as detected on coronary CT angiography."
https://openalex.org/W3003532911,"Objectives While previous cost-effectiveness studies on pembrolizumab in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have found these regimens to be cost-effective, their reliance on randomized controlled trial (RCT) data with strict inclusion criteria limits generalizability to patients with comorbidities. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of first-line pembrolizumab for patients with various comorbidities. Materials and methods In our base case analysis, we studied pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (pembrolizumab combination therapy) versus chemotherapy alone. In a secondary analysis, we considered only patients with PD-L1 expression of at least 50% (PD-L1-high) and evaluated pembrolizumab monotherapy, pembrolizumab combination therapy, and chemotherapy alone. Microsimulation models were developed for the base case and the PD-L1-high analyses. To estimate outcomes of patients with differing comorbidities, we combined survival data from patients with few or no comorbidities from the RCTs with estimates from the general population obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Comorbidity burden level was divided into three groups based on the Charlson score (equal to 0, 1, or 2+); patients with various other specific comorbidities were also analyzed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were compared to a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results In the Charlson 0, Charlson 1, and Charlson 2+ patient populations, estimated ICERs for pembrolizumab combination therapy in the base case model were $173,919/QALY, $175,165/QALY, and $181,777/QALY, respectively, compared to chemotherapy. In the PD-L1-high model, the Charlson 0, Charlson 1, and Charlson 2+ patients had ICERs of $147,406/QALY, $149,026/QALY, and $154,521/QALY with pembrolizumab combination therapy versus chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was weakly dominated for each comorbidity group in the PD-L1-high model. Conclusion For patients with stage IV NSCLC and varying comorbidity burden, first-line treatment with pembrolizumab does not represent a cost-effective strategy compared to chemotherapy. Resources should be focused on collecting immunotherapy survival data for more representative NSCLC patient populations."
https://openalex.org/W3004321271,"This study aimed to develop a seven-item brief parenting scale (PS-7) based on the original parenting scale (PS) and various other shortened versions and with a better factor structure for the parents of adolescents. The scale was tested with a sample of 3,777 parents (2,205 mothers and 1,572 fathers). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the dimensionality of the different versions of the PS. Only the PS-7 with a two-factor structure, i.e., laxness (three items) and overreactivity (four items), showed a good model fit based on a representative sample of parents of junior secondary school students. Overall, the results suggest that PS-7 is comparable to the original PS and possesses good psychometric properties in terms of internal consistency, factorial validity, construct validity, criterion validity and discriminant validity. The abbreviated parenting scale also provides a reliable and cost-effective method for assessing parental practices for treatment and assessing treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3003691144,"Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis is a highly conserved multistep pathway. The first step, the conversion of GTP to cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP), requires the bicistronic gene molybdenum cofactor synthesis 1 (MOCS1). Alternative splicing of MOCS1 within exons 1 and 9 produces four different N-terminal and three different C-terminal products (type I–III). Type I splicing results in bicistronic transcripts with two open reading frames, of which only the first, MOCS1A, is translated, whereas type II/III splicing produces MOCS1AB proteins. Here, we first report the cellular localization of alternatively spliced human MOCS1 proteins. Using fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and cell fractionation experiments, we found that depending on the alternative splicing of exon 1, type I splice variants (MOCS1A) either localize to the mitochondrial matrix (exon 1a) or remain cytosolic (exon 1b). MOCS1A proteins required exon 1a for mitochondrial translocation, but fluorescence microscopy of MOCS1AB variants (types II and III) revealed that they were targeted to mitochondria independently of exon 1 splicing. In the latter case, cell fractionation experiments displayed that mitochondrial matrix import was facilitated via an internal motif overriding the N-terminal targeting signal. Within mitochondria, MOCS1AB underwent proteolytic cleavage resulting in mitochondrial matrix localization of the MOCS1B domain. In conclusion, MOCS1 produces two functional proteins, MOCS1A and MOCS1B, which follow different translocation routes before mitochondrial matrix import for cPMP biosynthesis involving both proteins. MOCS1 protein maturation provides a novel alternative splicing mechanism that ensures the coordinated mitochondrial targeting of two functionally related proteins encoded by a single gene.

https://openalex.org/W3003729303,"Snyder–Robinson syndrome (SRS) is an X-linked intellectual disability syndrome caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the spermine synthase (SMS) gene. Primarily affecting males, the main manifestations of SRS include osteoporosis, hypotonic stature, seizures, cognitive impairment, and developmental delay. Because there is no cure for SRS, treatment plans focus on alleviating symptoms rather than targeting the underlying causes. Biochemically, the cells of individuals with SRS accumulate excess spermidine, whereas spermine levels are reduced. We recently demonstrated that SRS patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells are capable of transporting exogenous spermine and its analogs into the cell and, in response, decreasing excess spermidine pools to normal levels. However, dietary supplementation of spermine does not appear to benefit SRS patients or mouse models. Here, we investigated the potential use of a metabolically stable spermine mimetic, (R,R)-1,12-dimethylspermine (Me2SPM), to reduce the intracellular spermidine pools of SRS patient-derived cells. Me2SPM can functionally substitute for the native polyamines in supporting cell growth while stimulating polyamine homeostatic control mechanisms. We found that both lymphoblasts and fibroblasts from SRS patients can accumulate Me2SPM, resulting in significantly decreased spermidine levels with no adverse effects on growth. Me2SPM administration to mice revealed that Me2SPM significantly decreases spermidine levels in multiple tissues. Importantly, Me2SPM was detectable in brain tissue, the organ most affected in SRS, and was associated with changes in polyamine metabolic enzymes.

The extent of this elevated ratio in individual patient cells depends on the nature of the mutation and appears to correlate with enzyme activity level and the resulting pathologic severity, although existing data are insufficient to conclude a genotype–phenotype correlation.

The mammalian polyamines, which include SPM, SPD, and their precursor putrescine (PUT), are absolutely required for many critical cellular functions, and their levels are under strict homeostatic control. However, the skewed ratio in SRS patients clearly has greater pathological consequences for certain tissues, including brain, bone, and muscle. Initially, it was thought that dietary SPM supplementation would be a simple treatment strategy for SRS. Based on data from an early mouse model of SRS (13Mackintosh C.A. Pegg A.E.

Schwartz, private communication. this approach appears to be ineffective because of complexities not yet understood. Because polyamine transport is generally down-regulated in the presence of high intracellular polyamine concentrations (15Seiler N. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Polyamine transport in mammalian cells: an update.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28 (8811834): 843-86110.1016/1357-2725(96)00021-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), it was proposed that cells of SRS patients might lack the ability to transport extracellular SPM. However, our recent study using SRS patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells clearly demonstrated that polyamine transport activity in these cells is similar to that of WT SMS cells (16Murray-Stewart T. Dunworth M. Foley J.R. Schwartz C.E. Casero Jr., R.A. Polyamine homeostasis in Snyder–Robinson syndrome.Med. Sci. 2018; 6 (30544565): E11210.3390/medsci6040112Google Scholar). Not only can SRS lymphoblastoid cells efficiently transport SPM, they also respond to its accumulation by decreasing the excessive SPD pool to within normal levels. However, it is conceivable that cells of the lymphoblast lineage, which do not appear to be major contributors to the SRS pathology, differ in their polyamine transport ability from those of other lineages. Thus, the current study used a panel of fibroblast cell lines of SRS patient origin to investigate the transport of both native SPM and the SPM mimetic (R,R)-1,12-dimethylspermine (Me2SPM) (Fig. 1B). This metabolically stable SPM analog was used with the intention of circumventing the limitations known to exist for the use of native SPM as a treatment in vivo, including acute toxicities when administered to animals by intravenous, intraperitoneal, or oral routes (17Pegg A.E.

Like native SPM, Me2SPM has been shown to increase polyamine catabolism through increasing SSAT biosynthesis and activity, thus reducing intracellular SPD pools (24Yang J. Xiao L. Berkey K.A.

Using lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cell lines from SRS patients, the current study investigated the effects of Me2SPM treatment on proliferation, intracellular polyamine concentrations, and polyamine metabolic gene expression and enzyme activity. We also performed preliminary feasibility and toxicity testing in C57Bl/6J male mice that included determinations of Me2SPM accumulation, native polyamine concentrations, and activity assays of the rate-limiting polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and catabolic enzyme SSAT in brain, skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and kidney tissue from treated animals. These studies identified the (R,R)-diastereomer of 1,12-Me2SPM as a promising lead compound capable of reducing SPD levels in SRS cells while sustaining growth. Moreover, our in vivo study revealed that Me2SPM is distributed to and can modulate polyamine homeostasis and SPD levels in multiple tissues, including the brain, the primary organ affected in SRS. Our results form the basis for future preclinical studies aimed at optimization of in vivo Me2SPM dosing schedules to minimize toxic effects while correcting the imbalanced polyamine pools characteristic of Snyder–Robinson syndrome. We previously demonstrated that lymphoblastoid lines originating from SRS patients were able to transport exogenous SPM and restore a more normal polyamine distribution profile (16Murray-Stewart T. Dunworth M. Foley J.R. Schwartz C.E. Casero Jr., R.A. Polyamine homeostasis in Snyder–Robinson syndrome.Med. Sci. 2018; 6 (30544565): E11210.3390/medsci6040112Google Scholar). However, because the shift in polyamine distribution in these cells has not been associated with an overt phenotype in the patients, the possibility that cells of other lineages might not have the same transport capabilities was investigated. Fibroblast cell lines derived from the skin of five individual SRS patients, as well as two WT male donors, were used to ascertain whether polyamine transport was dysregulated in SRS fibroblast cells. The cells were treated for 24 h with 5 μm SPM, in the presence of aminoguanidine (a bovine serum amine oxidase inhibitor), followed by preparation of acid-extracted lysates for HPLC analysis of intracellular polyamines.

Sci. 2018; 6 (30544565): E11210.3390/medsci6040112Google Scholar), the untreated SRS fibroblast lines demonstrate significantly elevated SPD:SPM ratios (ranging from ∼3 to 13) as compared with cells with fully active spermine synthase (∼0.62) (Fig. 2A). Of note, the line SRS2 was derived from a patient harboring one of the most severe mutations with regard to SMS activity and SPD:SPM ratio (here measured as ∼13.23 versus WT ratios of ∼0.62) (9Albert J.S.

Importantly, treating each of these SRS fibroblast lines with SPM not only increased the intracellular concentration of SPM; it also drastically reduced the accumulation of SPD in each, resulting in SPD:SPM ratios substantially closer to the range observed in untreated WT cells. Additionally, the level of total polyamines in line SRS2 was more than double that of WT cells (39.2 versus 14.2 nmol/mg protein), and treatment with SPM reduced the total polyamine concentration to ∼16.5 nmol/mg protein. These results provide support that SRS cells of different lineages maintain their ability to transport SPM and consequently control the homeostatic distribution of the individual polyamines. SRS lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cell lines (two each) were incubated for 96 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of Me2SPM. Cell lines chosen for these studies represented severely affected and more mildly affected patients for each cell type. In each of the cell lines, treatment had no adverse effect on proliferation (Fig. 2B), whereas the intracellular concentration of SPD was efficiently reduced as the analog accumulated (Table 1). The resulting SPD:SPM ratios, calculated by incorporating the intracellular Me2SPM concentration as a portion of the SPM pool (SPD/SPM + Me2SPM), rapidly decreased with increasing mimetic uptake.Table 1Effects of Me2SPM on polyamine distribution in SRS patient-derived cell linesCell lineMe2SPMPUTSPDSPMMe2SPMSPD/SPM + Me2SPMμmnmol/mg proteinWT lymphoblastoid06.63 ± 1.2115.44 ± 1.409.12 ± 0.6301.69SRS1 lymphoblastoid02.66 ± 0.2235.17 ± 6.404.51 ± 0.9607.800.12.73 ± 0.1428.71 ± 3.363.42 ± 0.340.41 ± 0.067.500.62.94 ± 0.2724.30 ± 1.512.72 ± 0.124.36 ± 0.183.433.12.73 ± 0.2221.59 ± 5.292.65 ± 0.6224.64 ± 7.000.796.13.08 ± 0.2314.17 ± 2.031.91 ± 0.2920.26 ± 4.660.64SRS3 lymphoblastoid03.73 ± 0.7139.43 ± 4.522.85 ± 0.21013.840.13.24 ± 0.3834.45 ± 3.902.25 ± 0.130.83 ± 0.0711.190.65.60 ± 1.4039.27 ± 10.181.61 ± 0.3210.42 ± 1.583.263.14.71 ± 0.7212.82 ± 1.330.75 ± 0.0329.04 ± 3.850.436.14.80 ± 0.3512.71 ± 1.010.79 ± 0.0332.61 ± 3.030.38WT fibroblast003.09 ± 0.8911.11 ± 3.2400.28SRS3 fibroblast00.85 ± 0.3411.62 ± 3.533.00 ± 0.8503.870.10.98 ± 0.3613.77 ± 4.452.04 ± 0.606.08 ± 1.321.700.601.83 ± 0.271.42 ± 0.4233.15 ± 8.990.053.101.81 ± 0.421.23 ± 0.3827.22 ± 7.450.066.101.15 ± 0.140.82 ± 0.1920.03 ± 4.150.06 Open table in a new tab Our previous report found that SPM treatment of SRS lymphoblasts further decreased their already lowered levels of putrescine (16Murray-Stewart T.

The importance of this decreased PUT in SRS patients is unknown but could be of consequence particularly in the brain, because PUT can serve as a precursor to GABA (26Sequerra E.B. Gardino P.

Unlike native SPM, Me2SPM treatment did not further reduce the intracellular PUT levels observed in SRS patient lymphoblasts. Together, these results indicate the ability of Me2SPM to functionally substitute for SPM in supporting growth and proliferation of SRS cells while also reducing the intrinsic accumulation of SPD that is characteristic of a lack of spermine synthase activity. Me2SPM was previously shown to induce SSAT activity in a lung cancer cell line capable of extremely high SSAT induction (24Yang J. Xiao L. Berkey K.A. Tamez P.A. Coward J.K. Casero Jr., R.A. Significant induction of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase without cytotoxicity by the growth-supporting polyamine analogue 1,12-dimethylspermine.J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165 (7559809): 71-7610.1002/jcp.1041650109Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although treatment with Me2SPM is clearly capable of reducing SPD levels in SRS cells after 96 h, treatment of SRS lymphoblastoid cells for 24 h resulted in no significant change in SAT1 mRNA expression or SSAT activity (Fig. 3A). A related polyamine analog, bis(ethyl)spermine, was used as a positive control and induced SSAT activity by ∼20-fold in line Ly-SRS3. Additional analysis of the treated lymphoblastoid cells revealed no induction of N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase (PAOX) mRNA and a modest increase in activity (Fig. 3B). Spermine oxidase (SMOX) activity, which has the potential to produce toxic reactive oxygen species and aldehydes, was below the limits of detection in both untreated and treated cells. ODC activity was decreased in both WT and SRS lymphoblasts after 24 h and appeared to be post-transcriptional in nature (Fig. 3C). Although the observed changes in enzyme activities were modest, treatment did yield a significant decrease in intracellular SPD in the SRS cells, suggesting the potential for product inhibition of other biosynthetic enzymes in the pathway (Fig. 3D). Assays were also performed in line Ly-SRS1 with similar nonsignificant results. WT, male C57Bl/6J mice received intraperitoneal injections of the (R,R)-diastereomer of 1,12-Me2SPM to determine the tolerable dose range, as well as its tissue distribution and ability to alter tissue polyamine concentrations. Daily injections of 0, 5, and 10 mg/kg Me2SPM for 4 days had no adverse effect on mouse body mass (Fig. 4A), and no overt change in behavior was observed. Because mice treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg doses began losing weight after the first injection, the second injection was delayed until day 2. On day 3, one mouse each receiving 50 or 100 mg/kg Me2SPM had died overnight; the one other mouse in the 100 mg/kg group exhibited tremors, weakness, and anorexia. The majority of remaining mice in the 50 mg/kg group appeared weak, with body mass losses approaching 20%. Per protocol, mice in the 50 and 100 mg/kg groups were sacrificed for necropsy on day 3. At set time points, mice were necropsied and tissues were collected and divided for biochemical analyses and/or histopathology. Brain, liver, kidney, heart, and hindlimb striated muscle were sampled from all mice. These tissues are either known to be involved in the SRS phenotype or provide information on potential dose-limiting toxicity. At the subtoxic dose of 10 mg/kg, intracellular Me2SPM was detected in all organs examined, with the kidney and liver concentrations exceeding those of striated muscle and heart by ∼10-fold. A very small amount of Me2SPM was detected in the brain tissue of 10 mg/kg treated animals, likely because of passive diffusion across the blood–brain barrier (Fig. 4B). In animals receiving 50 mg/kg Me2SPM, there was greater accumulation of Me2SPM in all organs, with average brain tissue levels similar to those of muscle. Notably, a bimodal distribution was observed in Me2SPM concentration in the brains of mice in the 50 mg/kg treatment group, which segregated the two mice in the pilot study (7-week-old mice, top two data points) from the remaining four mice that were treated at 20 weeks of age. SSAT activity tended to increase in the brains of mice receiving 10 mg/kg Me2SPM, and a significant increase was detected in those in the 50 mg/kg group (Fig. 5A). Half of the mice in the high-dose group demonstrated increases in ODC activity as well, some of which were extremely high (Fig. 5B). This elevation of both SSAT and ODC likely contributed to the significantly increased PUT levels detected in the brain as well as the absence of a decrease in SPD at the 50 mg/kg dose (Fig. 5C). Hypotonia is a common phenotype in SRS males. Analyses of muscle tissue taken from the hind limb also indicated a low level of Me2SPM accumulation at the nontoxic doses (Fig. 4B), with decreased abundance of SPM rather than SPD with increasing dose (Fig. 5D). It is worth noting the organ-specific differences in SPD and SPM distribution in the absence of treatment, as the more abundant polyamine may be reduced first in WT mice. However, because SPD concentration presumably far exceeds SPM concentration in all tissues of SRS patients, we anticipate that Me2SPM will be capable of reducing the accumulation of SPD in all tissues. These studies await the availability of a phenotyped mouse model, which is currently being established (The Jackson Laboratory). Hearts from two mice of each group were used for polyamine analysis. The 10 mg/kg dose of Me2SPM had no apparent effect on polyamine levels in the heart muscle, an organ that is not often affected in SRS patients, despite the detection of Me2SPM. However, dosing with 50 mg/kg resulted in higher analog accumulation (Fig. 4B) with red"
https://openalex.org/W3003181918,"The mu-opioid receptor gene, OPRM1, undergoes extensive alternative splicing, creating an array of splice variants that are conserved from rodent to human. Both mouse and human OPRM1 have five exon 5-associated seven transmembrane full-length carboxyl terminal variants, MOR-1B1, MOR-1B2, MOR-1B3, MOR-1B4, and MOR-1B5, all of which are derived from alternative 3' splicing from exon 3 to alternative sites within exon 5. The functional relevance of these exon 5-associated MOR-1Bs has been demonstrated in mu agonist-induced G protein coupling, adenylyl cyclase activity, receptor internalization and desensitization, and post-endocytic sorting, as well as region-specific expression at the mRNA level. In the present study, we mapped a polyadenylation site for both mouse and human MOR-1Bs that defines the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of MOR-1Bs and stabilizes mMOR-1Bs mRNAs. We identified a conserved miR378a-3p sequence in the 3'-UTR of both mouse and human MOR-1BS transcripts through which miR-378a-3p can regulate the expression of MOR-1Bs at the mRNA level. Chronic morphine treatment significantly increased the miR-378-3p level in Be(2)C cells and the brainstem of the morphine tolerant mice, contributing to the decreased expression of the mouse and human MOR-1B3 and MOR-1B4. Our study provides new insights into the role of miRNAs and Oprm1 splice variants in morphine tolerance."

We detected genetic alterations (GAs) in 97% (36/37) of cases, averaging 2.51 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 0.91 gene fusions per patient. The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was the most common alteration (21/37 patients) followed by AFAP1-NTRK2 (2/37) and TBLXR-PI3KCA (2/37) fusions that were observed at much lower frequencies. The most frequently mutated) genes were NOTCH1-3 (7/37), ATM (4/37), RAD51C (3/37), RNF43 (3/37), SLX4 (3/37) and NF1 (3/37). Interestingly, we identified a GOPC-ROS1 fusion in an 8-year-old patient whose tumor lacked BRAF alterations and histologically classified as low grade glioma. The patient underwent gross total resection (GTR). The patient is currently disease free. To our knowledge this is the first report of GOPC-ROS1 fusion in PLGG.

In the canonical Hippo pathway, large tumor suppressor kinases 1/2 (LATS1/2) phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) and thereby suppress its nuclear localization and co-transcriptional activity. Nuclear Dbf2-related kinases 1/2 (NDR1/2), which are closely related to LATS1/2, also phosphorylate and inactivate YAP by suppressing its nuclear localization. Furry (FRY) is a cytoplasmic protein that associates with NDR1/2 and activates them, but its role in the nuclear/cytoplasmic localization of YAP remains unknown. Here, we constructed FRY-knockout cell lines to examine the role of FRY in YAP's cytoplasmic localization. FRY depletion markedly increased YAP nuclear localization and decreased NDR1/2 kinase activity and YAP phosphorylation levels, but did not affect LATS1/2 kinase activity. This indicated that FRY suppresses YAP's nuclear localization by promoting its phosphorylation via NDR1/2 activation. NDR1/2 depletion also promoted YAP nuclear localization, but depletion of both FRY and NDR1/2 increased the number of cells with YAP nuclear localization more strongly than did depletion of NDR1/2 alone, suggesting that FRY suppresses YAP nuclear localization by a mechanism in addition to NDR1/2 activation. Co-precipitation assays revealed that Fry uses its N-terminal 1–2400-amino-acid-long region to bind to YAP. Expression of full-length FRY or its 1–2400 N-terminal fragment restored YAP cytoplasmic localization in FRY-knockout cells.

https://openalex.org/W3003809798,"Background The age-specific epidemiology of child and adolescent tuberculosis (TB) is poorly understood, especially in rural areas of East Africa. We sought to characterize the age-specific prevalence and predictors of TB infection among children and adolescents living in rural Uganda, and to explore the contribution of household TB exposure on TB infection. Methods From 2015–2016 we placed and read 3,121 tuberculin skin tests (TST) in children (5–11 years old) and adolescents (12–19 years old) participating in a nested household survey in 9 rural Eastern Ugandan communities. TB infection was defined as a positive TST (induration ≥10mm or ≥5mm if living with HIV). Age-specific prevalence was estimated using inverse probability weighting to adjust for incomplete measurement. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the association between TB infection and multi-level predictors. Results The adjusted prevalence of TB infection was 8.5% (95%CI: 6.9–10.4) in children and 16.7% (95% CI:14.0–19.7) in adolescents. Nine percent of children and adolescents with a prevalent TB infection had a household TB contact. Among children, having a household TB contact was strongly associated with TB infection (aOR 5.5, 95% CI: 1.7–16.9), but the strength of this association declined among adolescents and did not meet significance (aOR 2.3, 95% CI: 0.8–7.0). The population attributable faction of TB infection due to a household TB contact was 8% for children and 4% among adolescents. Mobile children and adolescents who travel outside of their community for school had a 1.7 (95% CI 1.0–2.9) fold higher odds of TB infection than those who attended school in the community. Conclusion Children and adolescents in this area of rural eastern Uganda suffer a significant burden of TB. The majority of TB infections are not explained by a known household TB contact. Our findings underscore the need for community-based TB prevention interventions, especially among mobile youth."

Patients and methods Twenty volunteers (17 men, 3 women) who had been sent to work in Lhasa, Tibet for more than 6 months were enrolled. One of their journeys from Beijing to Lhasa was chosen as the time for the examination. IOP, AL, corneal curvature (K), and blood pressure (BP) were measured in Beijing (altitude 43 m) and Lhasa (altitude 3658 m). Their first examination was conducted at least 1 day before arriving in Lhasa and the second examination after they had stayed in Lhasa for 7 days. The data from the highland and lowland examinations were analyzed with a paired-sample T test and Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for the association between IOP and average BP. Results The mean IOP was 12.65±2.34 mmHg in Beijing and 14.85±3.1 mmHg in Lhasa. The mean AL was 24.61±1.50mm in Beijing, and 24.98±1.45 mm in Lhasa. The IOP and AL showed a significant elevation in highland compared with lowland (P<0.05). The mean K was 43.58±2.25 D in Beijing and 43.56±2.21 D in Lhasa and no significant difference was found in this study (P>0.05). A positive correlation between variance of IOP and ACD was found (r = 0.475, P<0.05) and no correlation between IOP and average BP was noted. Conclusions High altitude may lead to a small but significant change in IOP and axial length. However, the shape of the corneal surface was not influenced by the hypobaric and hypoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3003768006,"Background It is widely recognised that mental health policies should be developed in consultation with those tasked with their implementation and the users affected by them. In the South African legislative context public participation in policymaking is assumed, with little guidance on how to conduct consultation processes, nor how to use consultation inputs in policy decisions. Methods The South African Mental Health Policy Framework and Strategic Plan was adopted in 2013 after an extensive consultation process. Focussing on the 2012 provincial and national consultation summit, this case-study conducted key informant interviews and undertook documentary analysis to explore the process through which consultation inputs were–or were not–transferred to inform this policy. Between 2013 and 2016 seven interviews were conducted, and 11 documents (policy drafts and summit outputs) and transcripts of 23 audio-recorded sessions from the national summit were analysed. Results Findings revealed that no substantive changes were made to the mental health policy following the consultation summits. There do not seem to have been systematic processes for facilitating and capturing knowledge inputs, or for transferring these inputs between provincial and national levels. There was also no further consultation regarding priorities identified for implementation prior to finalisation of the policy, with participants highlighting concerns about policy implementation at local levels as a result. This represents a lost opportunity for greater involvement of service users in policy development. Conclusions Together with poor service-user representation, the format of the consultation process limited participant interaction and the possibility for engagement with, or uptake of, more experiential forms of knowledge. Several procedural elements were found to limit the elicitation and transference of consultation contributions for uptake into policy. Recommendations for future policy consultations include adapting the format of participatory processes to enable optimal use of participant knowledge, as well as greater service-user participation."
https://openalex.org/W3003385961,"The placenta plays a central role in the epigenetic programming of neurodevelopment by prenatal stress (PS), but this pathway is not fully understood. It difficult to study in humans because the conditions for intense, traumatic PS are almost impossible to create ethically. This study was able to capitalize on a 2012 disaster that hit New York, Superstorm Sandy, to examine the impact of traumatic stress on placental gene expression while also examining normative PS, and compare the two. Of the 303 expectant mothers participating in the Stress in Pregnancy Study, 95 women were pregnant when Superstorm Sandy struck. During their pregnancy, participants completed self-report measures of PS and distress that were combined, using latent profile analysis, into one global indicator of normative PS. Placental tissue was collected at delivery and frozen for storage. RNA expression was assessed for 40 placental genes known to associate with the stress response system and neurodevelopment in offspring. Results showed that normative PS increased expression of just MECP2, HSD11B2, and ZNF507, whereas Superstorm Sandy PS decreased expression of CDKL5, CFL1, DYRK1A, HSD11B2, MAOA, MAOB, NCOR1, and ZNF507. Interaction analyses indicated that Superstorm Sandy PS was associated with decreased gene expression for the low and high PS group for CFL1, DYRK1A, HSD11B2, MAOA, and NCOR1 and increased expression for the moderate PS group for FOXP1, NR3C1, and NR3C2. This study supports the idea that a moderate amount of normative PS may buffer the impact of traumatic PS, in this case caused by Superstorm Sandy, on placental gene expression, which suggests that the placenta itself mirrors the organism’s ability to develop an epigenetic resilience to, and inoculation from, stress."
https://openalex.org/W3003412403,"Objectives Quadriceps weakness (QW) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can be elicited by tourniquet-induced ischaemia reperfusion (IR), which causes a vigorous acute inflammatory response. Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are important determinants of organ and tissue protection from IR. This study aimed to examine the association between serum n-3 PUFA levels and QW, knee pain, and knee swelling immediately after TKA. Methods A total of 32 patients who underwent unilateral TKA participated in this prospective study. On Postoperative Day 1, serum n-3 PUFA (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) levels were measured. Preoperatively and on Postoperative Day 4, quadriceps strength, knee pain during quadriceps testing, and knee circumference were measured. QW, knee pain, and knee swelling were defined as changes in quadriceps strength, knee pain during quadriceps testing, and knee circumference, respectively, between the preoperative to the postoperative measurement. Results Mean serum n-3 PUFA levels were 192 μg/mL (standard deviation, 58 μg/mL) on Postoperative Day 1. All measured variables changed significantly between the preoperative and the postoperative measurement time-points (P <0.01). Quadriceps strength decreased from 1.2 to 0.4 Nm/kg (QW = −65%). Knee pain during quadriceps testing increased from 1.1 to 6.0 (knee pain = 4.0). Knee circumference increased from 40 to 44 cm (knee swelling = 10%). Multivariate analysis showed that lower serum n-3 PUFA levels were independently associated with an increased QW after adjusting for the Kellgren-Lawrence grade and the tourniquet time (P = 0.04). No significant relationship was observed between serum n-3 PUFA levels and knee pain or knee swelling. Conclusion Higher serum n-3 PUFA are independently associated with a lower increase in the QW immediately after TKA."

https://openalex.org/W3003556080,"In clinical gait analysis, measurement errors impede the reliability and repeatability of the measurements. This extrinsic variability can potentially mislead the clinical interpretation of the analysis and should thus be minimised. Skin marker misplacement has been identified as the largest source of extrinsic variability between measurements. The goal of this study was to test whether the fusion of motion capture and 3D medical imaging could reduce extrinsic variability due to skin marker misplacement. The fusion method consists in using anatomical landmarks identified with 3D medical imaging to correct marker misplacements. To assess the reduction of variability accountable to the fusion method, skin marker misplacements were voluntarily introduced in the measurement of the pelvis and hip kinematics during gait for two patients scheduled for unilateral hip arthroplasty and two patients that underwent unilateral hip arthroplasty. The root mean square deviation was reduced by -78 ± 15% and the range of variability by -80 ± 16% for the pelvis and hip kinematics in average. These results showed that the fusion method could significantly reduce the extrinsic variability due to skin marker misplacement and thus increase the reliability and repeatability of motion capture measurements. However, the identification of anatomical landmarks via medical imaging is a new source of extrinsic variability that should be assessed before considering the fusion method for clinical applications."

Heart rate behaviour was similar and does not seem to be a limiting factor for physical activity in daily life. Higher intensity activities should be implemented regularly in EDL for Fontan patients.

Patient and clinical characteristics, psychological distress, insomnia and sexual dysfunction were hypothesized to predict outcomes of medication adherence. Utilizing quantitative data from a hospital-based cross-sectional study from 358 male out-patients with hypertension attending a tertiary hospital in Ghana, medication adherence was associated with age, marital status, educational level, income, duration of diagnosis, number of medications taken and sexual dysfunction. These findings support the need for biopsychosocial interventions aiming at promoting adherence while taking these factors into consideration for the benefit of improving the health and general well-being of male patients with hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3003993899,"Fish oogenesis is characterised by a massive growth of oocytes each reproductive season. This growth requires the stockpiling of certain molecules, such as ribosomal RNAs to assist the rapid ribosomal assembly and protein synthesis required to allow developmental processes in the newly formed embryo. Massive 5S rRNA expression in oocytes, facilitated by transcription factor 3A (Gtf3a), serves as marker of intersex condition in fish exposed to xenoestrogens. Our present work on Gtf3a gene evolution has been analysed in silico in teleost genomes and functionally in the case of the zebrafish Danio rerio. Synteny-analysis of fish genomes has allowed the identification of two gtf3a paralog genes, probably emerged from the teleost specific genome duplication event. Functional analyses demonstrated that gtf3ab has evolved as a gene specially transcribed in oocytes as observed in Danio rerio, and also in Oreochromis niloticus. Instead, gtf3aa was observed to be ubiquitously expressed. In addition, in zebrafish embryos gtf3aa transcription began with the activation of the zygotic genome (~8 hpf), while gtf3ab transcription began only at the onset of oogenesis. Under exposure to 100 ng/L 17β-estradiol, fully feminised 61 dpf zebrafish showed transcription of ovarian gtf3ab, while masculinised (100 ng/L 17α-methyltestosterone treated) zebrafish only transcribed gtf3aa. Sex related transcription of gtf3ab coincided with that of cyp19a1a being opposite to that of amh and dmrt1. Such sex dimorphic pattern of gtf3ab transcription was not observed earlier in larvae that had not yet shown any signs of gonad formation after 26 days of oestradiol exposure. Thus, gtf3ab transcription is a consequence of oocyte differentiation and not a direct result of estrogen exposure, and could constitute a useful marker of gonad feminisation and intersex condition."
https://openalex.org/W3003931232,"Embryonic cell fate specification and axis patterning requires integration of several signaling pathways that orchestrate region-specific gene expression. The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) plays important roles during early development, but it is unclear how Stat3 is activated. Here, using Xenopus as a model, we analyzed the post-translational regulation and functional consequences of Stat3 activation in dorsoventral axis patterning. We show that Stat3 phosphorylation, lysine methylation, and transcriptional activity increase before gastrulation and induce ventral mesoderm formation. Down syndrome critical region gene 6 (DSCR6), a RIPPLY family member that induces dorsal mesoderm by releasing repressive polycomb group proteins from chromatin, bound to the Stat3 C-terminal region and antagonized its transcriptional and ventralizing activities by interfering with its lysine methylation. Enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb-repressive complex 2 subunit (Ezh2) also bound to this region; however, its methyltransferase activity was required for Stat3 methylation and activation. Loss of Ezh2 resulted in dorsalization of ventral mesoderm and formation of a secondary axis. Furthermore, interference with Ezh2 phosphorylation also prevented Stat3 lysine methylation and transcriptional activity. Thus, inhibition of either Ezh2 phosphorylation or Stat3 lysine methylation compensated for the absence of DSCR6 function. These results reveal that DSCR6 and Ezh2 critically and post-translationally regulate Stat3 transcriptional activity. Ezh2 promotes Stat3 activation in ventral mesoderm formation independently of epigenetic regulation, whereas DSCR6 specifies dorsal fate by counteracting this ventralizing activity.

However, the mechanism regulating Stat3 activation in these important processes remains largely elusive. In this study, we analyzed the regulation of Stat3 activation by DSCR6 and Ezh2 in mesoderm patterning using Xenopus embryo, which is particularly adapted for functional assays on inductive interactions. We show that both DSCR6 and Ezh2 bind to the C-terminal region of Stat3, forming a regulatory module in DV patterning. Ezh2 methyltransferase function is required for Stat3 transcriptional activity in ventral mesoderm specification. However, DSCR6 antagonizes the ventralizing effect of Stat3 either directly by preventing its activation, or indirectly by interference with Ezh2 function. Furthermore, we find that Ezh2 phosphorylation is required for Stat3 transcriptional activity and ventral mesoderm patterning. This may represent a molecular switch between Ezh2 epigenetic and nonepigenetic functions. Thus, DSCR6 and Ezh2 are important regulators of Stat3 activation in cell fate decisions. Altogether, this work reveals a critical nonepigenetic role of DSCR6 and Ezh2 in the post-translational control of embryonic axis patterning. Our previous study has demonstrated that Xenopus DSCR6 regulates embryonic axis formation by antagonizing the repressive activity of PcG proteins, including Ezh2 (8Li H.Y. Grifone R. Saquet A. Carron C. Shi D.L. The Xenopus homologue of Down syndrome critical region protein 6 drives dorsoanterior gene expression and embryonic axis formation by antagonising polycomb group proteins.Development. 2013; 140 (24301465): 4903-491310.1242/dev.098319Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To further understand the regulatory circuit underlying DSCR6-mediated specification of dorsal mesoderm fate, we used a co-immunoprecipitation assay to identify potential DSCR6 partners that repress dorsoanterior development in a similar way as Ezh2. Among different ventralizing factors tested, we found that DSCR6 biochemically interacted with Stat3, whose activation was shown to inhibit dorsal mesoderm formation (27Nishinakamura R. Matsumoto Y. Matsuda T. Ariizumi T. Heike T. Asashima M. Yokota T. Activation of Stat3 by cytokine receptor gp130 ventralizes Xenopus embryos independent of BMP-4.Dev. Biol. 1999; 216 (10642787): 481-49010.1006/dbio.1999.9518Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Stat3 protein comprises different functional domains involved in interaction with other partners and required for its transcriptional activity (Fig. 1A). A rabbit antibody against Xenopus DSCR6 precipitated increasing amounts of endogenous Stat3 protein from blastula to late gastrula stages (Fig. 1B). A GST pulldown assay using GST-DSCR6 and in vitro translated myc-tagged Stat3 protein further confirmed the physical interaction between DCSR6 and Stat3 (Fig. 1C). Next, we set to determine the region in Stat3 required for this interaction, using myc-tagged Stat3 deletion mutants expressed in the embryos following injection of the corresponding mRNAs (500 pg). GST pulldown experiments indicated that GST-DSCR6, but not GST alone, interacted with myc-tagged full-length Stat3, as well as Stat3ΔM lacking the coiled-coil and DNA-binding domains, but it did not interact with Stat3ΔC lacking the linker region, the Src homology 2 domain, and the transactivation domain (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the temporal binding between endogenous DSCR6 and Stat3, immunofluorescence staining showed that the DSCR6 protein was localized in the cytoplasm and nuclei of all three germ layers before and during gastrulation (Fig. 1, E–H). These results suggest that DSCR6 is expressed at appropriate stages to interact with Stat3 in embryonic patterning. We then examined how they functionally interact in DV patterning. First, we dorsally expressed Stat3C, a constitutively active form of Stat3 (25Ohkawara B. Shirakabe K. Hyodo-Miura J. Matsuo R. Ueno N. Matsumoto K. Shibuya H. Role of the TAK1-NLK-STAT3 pathway in TGF-β-mediated mesoderm induction.Genes Dev. 2004; 18 (15004007): 381-38610.1101/gad.1166904Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), either alone or coexpressed with DSCR6 in the dorsal region of 4-cell stage embryos. When compared with control embryos (Fig. 2, A and B), dorsal injection of Stat3C mRNA (500 pg) inhibited the expression of Spemann organizer genes at early gastrula stage. In severely affected embryos, the expression of chordin was strongly reduced (Fig. 2A′), and the expression of otx2 was completely blocked (Fig. 2B′). Coinjection of Dscr6 mRNA (100 pg) with Stat3C was able to rescue the normal expression pattern of chordin and otx2 in a large majority of embryos (Fig. 2, A″ and B″), indicating an antagonistic interaction between the two proteins. Moreover, in uninjected early gastrula, the expression of wnt8 and Xvent1 was detected in lateral and ventral regions (Fig. 2, C and D), whereas dorsal overexpression of Stat3C could induce their ectopic expression in the Spemann organizer region (Fig. 2, C′ and D′). This was also prevented by coexpression of DSCR6 (Fig. 2, C″ and D″). Consistently, Stat3C-induced anterior deficiency at the tail-bud stage was rescued by DSCR6 (Fig. 2, E–G). Conversely, ventral overexpression of DSCR6-induced ectopic expression of chordin (Fig. 2, H and H′), and otx2 (Fig. 2, I and I′), this could be counteracted by coexpression of Stat3C (Fig. 2, H″ and I″). In addition, Stat3C was also able to rescue wnt8 and Xvent1 expression inhibited by DSCR6 (Fig. 2, J–K″). Accordingly, DSCR6-induced formation of the secondary axis was strongly inhibited by Stat3 activation (Fig. 2, L–N). These observations suggest that DSCR6 and Stat3 mutually antagonize in DV patterning and embryonic axis formation. To examine whether the expression and activation of endogenous Stat3 is also consistent with an interaction with DSCR6, we first determined the temporal expression of total Stat3 and Stat3-Y705P by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). Total Stat3 was expressed at a relatively constant level from early cleavage stage (stage 2) to mid-gastrula stage (stage 11.5), and then decreased from late gastrula stage (stage 13) onward. However, Stat3-Y705P, which is phosphorylated on tyrosine 705 and possesses transcriptional activity, was strongly expressed in the late blastula (stage 9) and early gastrula stages (stage 10.5). Its expression began to decrease in the mid-gastrula (stage 11.5), and was undetectable at the tail-bud stage (stage 26). These were further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. In the large-cell blastula (stage 7), total Stat3 was present in the cytoplasm and nuclei (Fig. 3B). During gastrulation, it was mostly localized in the nuclei of all three germ layers (Fig. 3C). Consistent with Western blot analysis, Stat3-Y705P was absent in the large-cell blastula (Fig. 3D). However, its strong nuclear localization in different germ layers was evident in the early gastrula (Fig. 3E). Thus, the temporal and spatial activation of Stat3 is consistent with a role in embryonic patterning. We next directly monitored Stat3 transcriptional activity during early development using the pTATA-TK-Luc-4xM67 luciferase reporter that contains Stat-binding sites (32Besser D. Bromberg J.F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Hanafusa H. A single amino acid substitution in the v-Eyk intracellular domain results in activation of Stat3 and enhances cellular transformation.Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19 (9891073): 1401-140910.1128/MCB.19.2.1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Following injection of the reporter (150 pg) at the 2-cell stage, analysis of the promoter-driven reporter activity indicated that it was significantly up-regulated at the late blastula stage (stage 9), and further increased during gastrulation (Fig. 3F). To see if this could be influenced by DSCR6, we coinjected Dscr6 mRNA (500 pg) with the reporter at the 2-cell stage and cultured the embryos to early gastrula stage (stage 10.5). Analysis of the reporter activity showed that it was significantly reduced in the presence of DSCR6 (Fig. 3G), suggesting that DSCR6 functions to prevent Stat3 activation. To provide insights on how DSCR6 regulates Stat3 function, we first examined whether DCSR6 changes the protein level of Stat3 or Stat3-Y705P. Western blot analysis indicated that their expression was not affected following DCSR6 overexpression (Fig. S1). This suggests that DSCR6 inhibits Stat3 transcriptional activity in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Because it has been shown that Stat3 transcriptional activity also depends on lysine methylation (17Kim E. Kim M. Woo D.H. Shin Y. Shin J. Chang N. Oh Y.T. Kim H. Rheey J. Nakano I. Lee C. Joo K.M.

Protein extracts from the large-cell blastula (stage 7) and early gastrula (stage 10.5) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody for pan-methylated lysine (methyl-K), followed by Western blot analysis using Stat3 antibody. A band of expected size was detected in the early gastrula, but not in the large-cell blastula (Fig. 3H). Thus, we conclude that Stat3 becomes lysine-methylated at least at the beginning of gastrulation, which is consistent with the onset of its increased transcriptional activity. Of interest, overexpression of DSCR6 resulted in the disappearance of lysine-methylated Stat3 protein in the early gastrula (Fig. 3I). This result raises the possibility that DSCR6 inhibits Stat3 transcriptional activity in ventral mesoderm specification at least in part by preventing its lysine methylation. We previously showed that DSCR6 prevents Ezh2-mediated chromatin silencing in mesoderm induction and DV patterning (8Li H.Y. Grifone R. Saquet A. Carron C. Shi D.L.

These observations raise the possibility that DSCR6 may either directly regulate Stat3 activation, or indirectly through Ezh2. To examine whether Ezh2 interacts with Stat3, we first determined the expression pattern of Ezh2 protein by Western blotting. Comparable with the temporal expression of Stat3 protein at early stages, the Ezh2 protein level remained constant during cleavage and blastula stages, but increased from mid-gastrula stage onward (Fig. 4A).

Digital fundus images (45°) were obtained for both eyes under physiologic mydriasis and were graded using the international classification and grading system for age-related macular degeneration. The spherical equivalents of refractive errors were calculated in diopters using auto-refraction data.After adjustment for potential confounders, myopia was associated with lower risk of any age-related macular degeneration [odds ratio (OR), 0.74; 95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.61-0.91]. In particular, myopia was significantly associated with lower odds of age-related macular degeneration in female participants (any AMD: OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.93; early AMD: OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53-0.93) and in participants younger than 50 years (any AMD: OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.90; early AMD: OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.93). There was no significant association between myopia and age-related macular degeneration in male participants and in participants older than 50 years.In the Korean adult population, myopia was associated with significantly lower odds of any type of early age-related macular degeneration, particularly in females and in younger age groups."
https://openalex.org/W3004008980,"Multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy, is a genetically heterogeneous disease and the genetic factors that contribute to its development and progression remain to be fully elucidated. The tumour suppressor gene GLIPR1 has previously been shown to be deleted in approximately 10% of myeloma patients, to inhibit the development of plasma cell tumours in ageing mice and to have reduced expression levels in the plasma cells of patients with light-chain amyloidosis, a myeloma-related malignancy. Therefore, we hypothesised that GLIPR1 may have tumour suppressor activity in multiple myeloma. In this study, we demonstrate that plasma cell expression of GLIPR1 is reduced in the majority of myeloma patients and Glipr1 expression is lost in the 5TGM1 murine myeloma cell line. However, overexpression of GLIPR1 in a human myeloma cell line did not affect cell proliferation in vitro. Similarly, re-expression of Glipr1 in 5TGM1 cells did not significantly reduce their in vitro proliferation or in vivo growth in C57BL/KaLwRij mice. In addition, using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated C57BL/Glipr1-/- mice and showed that loss of Glipr1 in vivo did not affect normal haematopoiesis or the development of monoclonal plasma cell expansions in these mice up to one year of age. Taken together, our results suggest that GLIPR1 is unlikely to be a potent tumour suppressor in multiple myeloma. However, it remains possible that the down-regulation of GLIPR1 may cooperate with other genetic lesions to promote the development of myeloma."

These metabolites also accumulate in humans who have the disease classic galactosemia. Here, we demonstrate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains harboring a deletion of UBX4, a gene encoding a partner of Cdc48p in the endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, exhibit delayed UPR activation after lithium and galactose exposure because the deletion decreases galactose-1-phosphate levels. The delay in UPR activation did not occur in yeast strains in which key ERAD or proteasomal pathway genes had been disrupted, indicating that the ubx4Δ phenotype is ERAD-independent. We also observed that the ubx4Δ strain displays decreased oxygen consumption. The inhibition of mitochondrial respiration was sufficient to diminish galactose-1-phosphate levels and, consequently, affects UPR activation. Finally, we show that the deletion of the AMP-activated protein kinase ortholog–encoding gene SNF1 can restore the oxygen consumption rate in ubx4Δ strain, thereby reestablishing galactose metabolism, UPR activation, and cellular adaption to lithium–galactose challenge.

Here we show a novel and ERAD-independent role for Ubx4p in controlling mitochondrial and galactose metabolism. Our data demonstrate that UBX4 deletion impairs mitochondrial respiration, which in turn affects galactose metabolism and activation of the UPR. For these reasons, ubx4Δ mutants are less tolerant to lithium/galactose. Based on a genetic screen to identify new regulators of UPR activation induced by lithium and galactose treatment, we identified that the deletion of the UBX4/YMR067C gene delays UPR activation (Fig. 1A). In this context, the inhibition of the UPR pathway (e.g. deletion of IRE1 or HAC1 genes) causes loss of cell viability (3De-Souza E.A. Pimentel F.S. Machado C.M. Martins L.S. da-Silva W.S. Montero-Lomelí M. Masuda C.A. The unfolded protein response has a protective role in yeast models of classic galactosemia.Dis. Model. Mech. 2014; 7 (24077966): 55-6110.1242/dmm.012641Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We did not observe the same for the ubx4Δ mutant, which remained viable after 24 h of treatment with lithium in the presence of galactose (Fig. 1B), probably because this strain can still fully activate UPR (as measured by HAC1 mRNA splicing) after 4 h of treatment. These results suggest that Ubx4p is not interfering directly with Ire1p activity. Accordingly, the deletion of UBX4 did not affect UPR activation by tunicamycin treatment (Fig. S1). This raised the hypothesis that the deletion of UBX4 is delaying ER stress occurrence in a lithium–galactose–specific manner. As previously described by our group, UPR activation in models of galactosemia can be prevented by the deletion of yeast galactokinase GAL1 (3De-Souza E.A. Pimentel F.S. Machado C.M. Martins L.S. da-Silva W.S. Montero-Lomelí M. Masuda C.A. The unfolded protein response has a protective role in yeast models of classic galactosemia.Dis. Model. Mech. 2014; 7 (24077966): 55-6110.1242/dmm.012641Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that the synthesis of galactose-1-phosphate is an essential event for the UPR activation in this condition. Although we did not observe differences in the expression of genes of Leloir pathway (GAL1 and GAL2) (Fig. 1C), we measured the galactose and galactose-1-phosphate levels in the ubx4Δ mutant, and we observed an 82–85% decrease in galactose (Fig. 1D) and a 77–93% decrease in galactose-1-phosphate levels (Fig. 1E) when compared with a control strain, even without lithium. These results suggest that the delayed UPR activation in the ubx4Δ strain is due to the overall decreased levels of galactose-1-phosphate accumulated in this strain. Ubx4p is known to participate in the ERAD pathway and to regulate proper proteasome localization (22Alberts S.M. Sonntag C. Schäfer A. Wolf D.H.

Thus, we reasoned that mutations in other components of these pathways would also influence UPR activation in lithium/galactose-treated cells. Nonetheless, the deletion of UBC7, a central effector of ERAD pathway (21Thibault G. Ng D.T.W. The endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation pathways of budding yeast.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

A strategy to reduce lithium–galactose toxicity is to prevent galactose-1-phosphate accumulation (3De-Souza E.A. Pimentel F.S. Machado C.M. Martins L.S. da-Silva W.S. Montero-Lomelí M. Masuda C.A.

We assumed that because the deletion of UBX4 decreases intracellular galactose-1-phosphate content, the ubx4Δ would be more tolerant to the treatment of lithium and galactose. Surprisingly, we observed that UBX4 deletion results in a decreased cellular tolerance to lithium in galactose-containing medium but not in glucose-containing medium (Fig. 3A). A decrease of ERAD or proteasome cellular function does not explain this increased sensitivity because neither the deletion of RPN4 nor the deletion of UBC7 modified the cellular sensitivity to lithium and galactose (Fig. 3B). We also tested mutations in other components of these pathways but could not observe significant differences in cell growth among those strains (Fig. S2). Our data suggested that the deletion of UBX4 might be acting on the lithium–galactose tolerance via other mechanism rather than regulating galactose metabolism. Previous work suggested that the deletion of the UBX4 gene increases the frequency of petite colonies, which in general is related to deficiencies in mitochondrial metabolism (35Hess D.C. Myers C.L. Huttenhower C. Hibbs M.A. Hayes A.P. Paw J. Clore J.J. Mendoza R.M. Luis B.S. Nislow C. Giaever G. Costanzo M. Troyanskaya O.G. Caudy A.A. Computationally driven, quantitative experiments discover genes required for mitochondrial biogenesis.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5 (19300474): e100040710.1371/journal.pgen.1000407Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Hence, we monitored the respiration capacity of this strain, and we observed a greater than 10-fold decrease in oxygen consumption rate in the ubx4Δ cells compared with the cells of a control strain when grown in galactose (Fig. 4A). The impaired galactose metabolism observed in ubx4Δ does not seem to be solely responsible for the decreased mitochondrial respiration because the gal1Δ strain, which cannot metabolize galactose because of the lack of galactokinase, presents only a slight decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption under the same conditions. This result is expected because these strains are growing in a rich medium containing other carbon sources, such as amino acids, which can sustain mitochondrial respiration when galactose metabolism is impaired. We also observed that the deletion of UBX4 reduced oxygen consumption in the absence of galactose metabolism, for example, when cells were grown on YPGly (medium containing glycerol, a nonfermentable carbon source) (Fig. S3A). The deletion of neither UBC7 nor RPN4 affected oxygen consumption rates (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3A), suggesting that an impairment of ERAD or proteasome function does not contribute for this ubx4Δ phenotype. The fact that mitochondrial preparations from ubx4Δ cells present decreased oxygen consumption capacity when compared with mitochondrial preparations from a control yeast strain (Fig. S3, B and C) further supports the hypothesis that the effect of UBX4 deletion on oxygen consumption in vivo is not only due to its impact on galactose metabolism. A hypothesis to explain the decreased tolerance to lithium and galactose observed in the ubx4Δ strain is that, under this condition, cells are more dependent on respiration, and because the ubx4Δ strain presents a decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, it cannot grow properly. This is in line with previous data from our group showing that lithium–galactose–treated control cells have a metabolic shift from fermentation to respiration (11Bro C. Regenberg B. Lagniel G. Labarre J. Montero-Lomelí M. Nielsen J. Transcriptional, proteomic, and metabolic responses to lithium in galactose-grown yeast cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12791685): 32141-3214910.1074/jbc.M304478200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Accordingly, if we simulate the ubx4Δ defects in both galactose and mitochondrial metabolism by growing the gal1Δ strain in the presence of antimycin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex III, the cells become unable to grow on galactose (Fig. 4B). We reasoned that mitochondrial function could be upstream of galactose metabolism and UPR activation in lithium-treated yeast cells. Accordingly, previous studies showed that GAL1 gene expression is down-regulated in strains with mutations in components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain or in yeast strains with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (36Li Y. Chen G. Liu W. Multiple metabolic signals influence GAL gene activation by modulating the interaction of Gal80p with the transcriptional activator Gal4p.Mol.

Commun. 2006; 339 (16297867): 30-3610.1016/j.bbrc.2005.11.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). On the other hand, another study observed that yeast cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA (rho0) present an increase in Gal4-dependent transcription (38Jelicić B. Traven A. Filić V. Sopta M. Mitochondrial dysfunction enhances Gal4-dependent transcription.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 253 (16239078): 207-21310.1016/j.femsle.2005.09.033Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it remains to be tested whether mitochondrial dysfunction promotes alterations in galactose metabolite levels. To test these hypotheses under our growth conditions, we first inhibited yeast mitochondrial function by deleting COQ3 or ATP7 genes, which impairs mitochondrial respiratory chain function (39Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. Ubiquinone biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: isolation and sequence of COQ3, the 3,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoate methyltransferase gene.J. Biol.
