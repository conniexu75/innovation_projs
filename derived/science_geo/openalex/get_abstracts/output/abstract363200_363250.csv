https://openalex.org/W2169903226,"Amino acids are required for activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase which regulates protein translation, cell growth, and autophagy. Cell surface transporters that allow amino acids to enter the cell and signal to mTOR are unknown. We show that cellular uptake of L-glutamine and its subsequent rapid efflux in the presence of essential amino acids (EAA) is the rate-limiting step that activates mTOR. L-glutamine uptake is regulated by SLC1A5 and loss of SLC1A5 function inhibits cell growth and activates autophagy. The molecular basis for L-glutamine sensitivity is due to SLC7A5/SLC3A2, a bidirectional transporter that regulates the simultaneous efflux of L-glutamine out of cells and transport of L-leucine/EAA into cells. Certain tumor cell lines with high basal cellular levels of L-glutamine bypass the need for L-glutamine uptake and are primed for mTOR activation. Thus, L-glutamine flux regulates mTOR, translation and autophagy to coordinate cell growth and proliferation."

In pollen from the model plant Arabidopsis, we show that TEs are unexpectedly reactivated and transpose, but only in the pollen vegetative nucleus, which accompanies the sperm cells but does not provide DNA to the fertilized zygote. TE expression coincides with downregulation of the heterochromatin remodeler DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 and of many TE siRNAs. However, 21 nucleotide siRNAs from Athila retrotransposons are generated and accumulate in pollen and sperm, suggesting that siRNA from TEs activated in the vegetative nucleus can target silencing in gametes. We propose a conserved role for reprogramming in germline companion cells, such as nurse cells in insects and vegetative nuclei in plants, to reveal intact TEs in the genome and regulate their activity in gametes.

Transposable elements (TEs) are the targets of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing in animals, fungi, and plants. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, siRNAs involved in posttranscriptional silencing (such as microRNAs and trans-acting siRNAs) are 21 nucleotides (nt) in length, while siRNAs involved in heterochromatin formation are 24 nt (Hamilton et al., 2002Hamilton A.

Each class of siRNA is bound by different Argonaute proteins, of which ten are found in Arabidopsis. In animals, but apparently not in plants, additional 25–29 nt piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are produced and utilized by the PIWI clade of Argonaute proteins. piRNAs arise from repetitive DNA in a Dicer-independent mechanism (Aravin et al., 2007Aravin A.A.

In rodents, piRNAs produced in the male germline silence TEs and directly or indirectly target these regions for DNA methylation (Carmell et al., 2007Carmell M.A. Girard A. van de Kant H.J.

Unlike animals, plants do not set aside their germline cells early in development. Instead, plant germ cells differentiate from somatic cells in the adult. Male meiocytes in the developing anther give rise to four haploid microspores. Microspores undergo a subsequent mitotic division, producing a binucleate pollen grain, with one smaller cell completely enclosed within the larger. The smaller (generative) cell further divides into two sperm cells (SCs). In Arabidopsis, the mature pollen grain shed by the anther houses two identical SCs that provide the paternal genetic contribution to the zygote and the endosperm, respectively, in double fertilization. The delivery of the sperm is controlled by the pollen vegetative nucleus (VN), which has decondensed chromatin compared to the compact sperm, and does not contribute DNA to the fertilized zygote nor to the endosperm (McCormick, 1993McCormick S.

Genet. 2005; 37: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar), and that many of the genes involved in siRNA biogenesis and silencing are either not expressed in pollen or expressed at low levels (Pina et al., 2005Pina C.

We have found that the chromatin remodeling ATPase DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1) accumulates only in SCs and not in the VN. DDM1 is the master regulator of TE activity in Arabidopsis, as most TEs lose DNA methylation, repressive histone modifications, and 24 nt siRNAs in ddm1 mutants (Gendrel et al., 2002Gendrel A.V. Lippman Z. Yordan C. Colot V. Martienssen R.A.

May B. Yordan C. Singer T. Martienssen R. Distinct mechanisms determine transposon inheritance and methylation via small interfering RNA and histone modification.PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Consistent with the loss of DDM1, most 24 nt TE siRNAs are lost from mature pollen, coincident with the accumulation of diverse TE transcripts as well as TE transposition. However, this transposition is limited to the pollen VN so that transposed elements are not transmitted to the next generation. Comparison of siRNA sequences from pollen, purified SCs, and ddm1 mutant plants reveals that the loss of DDM1 from the VN results in reactivation of TEs and accumulation of 21 nt siRNAs from the Athila family of gypsy-class retrotransposons. These Athila siRNAs preferentially accumulate in the neighboring SCs. By this mechanism, activation of retrotransposons in the VN reveals their presence in the genome, and presumably targets their silencing in SCs, preventing transposition and promoting transgenerational TE silencing. To determine the developmental expression profile of diverse types of TEs, we assayed TE expression using Affymetrix Ath1 microarray data during plant development, assembled in AtGenExpress (Schmid et al., 2005Schmid M. Davison T.S. Henz S.R. Pape U.J. Demar M. Vingron M. Scholkopf B. Weigel D. Lohmann J.U. A gene expression map of Arabidopsis thaliana development.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). By comparing the Ath1 microarray gene list to the Repbase repeat database, we identified probe sets that detect ORFs from seven known TEs, including at least one putatively autonomous full-length element for each class: DNA transposon, LTR retrotransposon, non-LTR retrotransposons, and helitron (Table S3 available online; Experimental Procedures). We found that the developmental expression patterns of diverse TEs were highly similar to each other and that for the majority of tissues and stages TEs were either not expressed or expressed at a very low level, indicating they are generally silenced in Arabidopsis (Figure 1). However, the seven full-length TEs examined were coordinately expressed in mature pollen (top portion, Figure 1). These expression patterns were verified by RT-PCR (Figure S1). Weak expression of several TEs in developing seeds was also detected by microarray (Figure 1), though not by RT-PCR (Figure S1). The observed coregulation of TEs could potentially depend on their chromosomal location and context. The expression patterns and locations of 34 diverse TEs from the short arm of chromosome 1 (see the Experimental Procedures) are depicted in Figure 1. The coordinated upregulation of TEs in mature pollen was observed for 30 of 34 elements (Figure 1), independent of their location on the chromosome: unique probes located in gene-rich regions were regulated in exactly the same way as unique probes located in heterochromatic regions. Therefore, the unexpected coordinated expression of diverse TEs in mature pollen does not depend on (cis-acting) position, but rather on the loss of trans-acting silencing factors. To determine the scope of TE reactivation in pollen, we assayed TE activity in maize pollen. We have shown that a silenced TE is transiently reactivated in maize pollen (Figure S2), and additionally TE expression has been noted in the pollen of rice (Nobuta et al., 2007Nobuta K. Venu R.C. Lu C. Belo A. Vemaraju K. Kulkarni K. Wang W. Pillay M. Green P.J. Wang G.L. Meyers B.C. An expression atlas of rice mRNAs and small RNAs.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, the transient reactivation of silenced TEs in pollen is conserved among flowering plants. To characterize the expression pattern of TEs in pollen, we identified 12 enhancer trap (ET) and 12 gene trap (GT) insertions into a variety of TEs in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) Arabidopsis accession (Table S1). Upon staining for GUS reporter gene activity, most ET and GT TE lines lacked staining in the plant body, but all lines had strongly stained mature pollen (Figure 2, Figure S3A, and Table S1). Under the same staining conditions, mature pollen of Ler Arabidopsis does not stain (Figure 2A). Thus, we have shown the transcriptional reactivation of diverse TEs in mature pollen using three different techniques in two different Arabidopsis strains (Columbia and Ler). Using the representative gene trap GT7390 inserted into an AtCopia LTR retrotransposon, we examined TE expression within the pollen grain. GUS staining in GT7390 was detected throughout the pollen cytoplasm (Figure 2B), which is maintained by the pollen VN. This pollen grain was counterstained with DAPI to locate the VN and SCs (Figure 2C). SCs do not accumulate GUS stain (Figure 2D), and since proteins such as GFP produced in the SCs do not freely pass into the pollen grain cytoplasm (Engel et al., 2005Engel M.L. Holmes-Davis R. McCormick S. Green sperm. Identification of male gamete promoters in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), this suggests that the VN is the site of TE reactivation. To determine whether TE transcripts were produced from the SCs (in addition to the VN), we looked for TE transcripts in the Ath1 microarray expression profile of purified sperm (Borges et al., 2008Borges F. Gomes G. Gardner R. Moreno N. McCormick S. Feijo J.A. Becker J.D. Comparative transcriptomics of Arabidopsis sperm cells.Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 1168-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In the microarray expression profile of purified SCs, we did not find any evidence of TE transcripts (Figure S4). To examine TE expression in the female gametophyte, we stained carpels of ET and GT lines inserted into TEs, and we found no GUS expression in the mature carpel (Figure 2E and Figure S3). Staining of immature ovules (summarized in Figures 2G and 2H) and mature pollinated carpels (summarized in Figure 2J) failed to detect any GUS expression in carpels or ovules for GT7390, or other ETs or GTs inserted into TEs (Table S1). Thus, expression of at least these TEs is elevated in the male gametophyte to a significantly greater extent than in the female. To determine the developmental timing of TE pollen expression, we stained developing flowers from GT7390 for GUS activity (Figure 2K). Anthers at floral stages 8–9 did not stain, while stage 10–11 anthers stained weakly. At floral stages 10–11, meiosis has occurred and the pollen grain is beginning to differentiate (Goldberg et al., 1993Goldberg R.B. Beals T.P. Sanders P.M. Anther development: basic principles and practical applications.Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1217-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). After pollination, GUS-positive pollen tubes were observed in GT7390 carpels (Figure 2M), and we detect elevated TE transcripts in microarray data from growing pollen tubes, as well as desiccated and hydrated mature pollen grains (Wang et al., 2008Wang Y. Zhang W.Z. Song L.F. Zou J.J. Su Z. Wu W.H. Transcriptome analyses show changes in gene expression to accompany pollen germination and tube growth in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Both the timing and location of TE activation in pollen demonstrate that the VN is the origin of TE expression. Transcriptional activation of TEs in mature pollen could lead to TE mobility, so we performed amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) transposable element display to detect new insertions of TEs in pollen DNA. This technique detects restriction site polymorphisms generated upon insertion. Using nested PCR primer sets from the AtMu1 DNA transposon, Tag2 DNA transposon, and AtLine1 non-LTR retrotransposon families, we detected new restriction site polymorphisms in the pollen sample (Figure S5), suggesting that these TEs are mobile in wild-type plants at this stage of development. Only a subset of AtMu1 family elements, which belong to the AtMu1a and AtMu1b subfamilies, are capable of transposition when activated (Singer et al., 2001Singer T. Yordan C. Martienssen R.A. Robertson's Mutator transposons in A. thaliana are regulated by the chromatin-remodeling gene Decrease in DNA Methylation (DDM1).Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Under more stringent PCR conditions that would only detect the highly similar AtMu1a and AtMu1b subfamilies, three new polymorphisms found in pollen (Figure 3A) were excised from the gel, cloned, and sequenced. These new polymorphisms correspond to new AtMu1a insertions, two of which are located near the transcriptional start of protein-coding genes, a known preference for insertion of Mutator family TEs (Lisch, 2002Lisch D. Mutator transposons.Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 498-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, TEs that are epigenetically silent throughout most of development are transiently reactivated and transpose in mature pollen. To determine whether new transpositions in pollen were inherited by the next generation, we analyzed 500 progeny of the 96 plants used for pollen collection in Figure 3A in a pool. No new insertions were detected in this pool of progeny seedlings (Figure 3B). This suggests that transpositions do not occur in the somatic lineage leading to meiocytes, because insertions would be present in the SCs and passed to the next generation. Additionally, TE mobility could not have occurred before the mitotic divisions that produce the haploid VN and SCs. Instead, the TE insertions in pollen must have taken place in the VN of the pollen grain, which does not contribute DNA to the fertilized zygote. Therefore, both TE expression and mobility are generated by the VN of wild-type pollen. Epigenetic reactivation of TEs is often associated with loss of DNA methylation, for example in DNA methyltransferase mutants (Lippman et al., 2003Lippman Z. May B. Yordan C. Singer T. Martienssen R. Distinct mechanisms determine transposon inheritance and methylation via small interfering RNA and histone modification.PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To monitor DNA methylation, we converted all unmethylated cytosine to thymine using bisulfite conversion. After bisulphite treatment, unmethylated cytosines are converted to thymine, whereas methylated cytosines are unchanged. We followed the bisulfite conversion by sequencing an unmethylated gene as a control, along with the 5′ terminal inverted repeat (TIR) of the DNA transposon AtMu1a (At4g08680) and the 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR) of the retrotransposon AtGP1 (At4g03650), from mature pollen as well as wild-type leaf DNA (Figure S6 and Figure 4). Both AtMu1a and AtGP1 retained some DNA methylation in mature pollen in all three sequence contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH). For AtGP1, the LTR as a whole had similar levels of methylation compared to the leaf, although methylation was lost from specific cytosines close to the promoter (Figure S6). In contrast, for AtMu1, asymmetric DNA methylation and some CHG symmetric DNA methylation were reduced on both the sense and antisense strands of the TIR (Figure 4). Since asymmetric DNA methylation is targeted by siRNAs, the reduction of asymmetric DNA methylation from the AtMu1 TIR suggests that this region is not targeted by siRNAs in mature pollen. The analysis of DNA methylation in mature pollen is confounded by the presence of two very different nuclei (the VN and SCs). We used DNA isolated from purified SCs (Borges et al., 2008Borges F. Gomes G. Gardner R. Moreno N. McCormick S. Feijo J.A. Becker J.D. Comparative transcriptomics of Arabidopsis sperm cells.Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 1168-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) to assay the DNA methylation levels of the AtMu1 TIR in sperm. Cytosines in all sequence contexts were highly methylated on both sense and antisense strands in SCs, and in particular CHG and CHH methylation were increased compared to whole pollen and leaf (Figure 4). These data demonstrate that the location of reduced DNA methylation in the pollen grain must be in the pollen VN. Furthermore, in the total pollen bisulfite sequencing data, individual clones specific to either the VN (reduced methylation) or SCs (increased methylation) could be distinguished (Figure 4). This suggests that the reduced DNA methylation in pollen is not the result of all DNA strands losing some DNA methylation—rather, the sperm-derived DNA retains high levels of DNA methylation in all sequence contexts, whereas the VN-derived DNA lacks most asymmetrical and some CHG methylation, corresponding to the reactivation and mobilization of TEs. We sought an explanation for the activation and demethylation of TEs in pollen by examining the expression of genes known to regulate TEs. Many genes involved in siRNA-mediated silencing and heterochromatin regulation have reduced expression in mature pollen (Pina et al., 2005Pina C. Pinto F. Feijo J.A. Becker J.D. Gene family analysis of the Arabidopsis pollen transcriptome reveals biological implications for cell growth, division control, and gene expression regulation.Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 744-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) (Table S4). RT-PCR analysis of these genes demonstrates that the 24 nt siRNA-mediated heterochromatin-formation pathway is downregulated in mature pollen (Figure S7), whereas expression is normal for the trans-acting siRNA pathway genes, as well as the microRNA specific Dicer DCL1, suggesting that the microRNA and tasiRNA pathways are functional in the pollen grain. Interestingly, the TE master-regulator gene DDM1 is expressed in pollen and is highly enriched in SCs (Borges et al., 2008Borges F. Gomes G. Gardner R. Moreno N. McCormick S. Feijo J.A. Becker J.D. Comparative transcriptomics of Arabidopsis sperm cells.Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 1168-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To determine whether siRNA loss is responsible for TE activation in pollen, we assayed siRNA accumulation from several TEs (Figure 5A). siRNAs from the AtMu1 DNA transposon and the AtSINE2A nonautonomous non-LTR retrotransposon were both absent in mature pollen. Interestingly, loss of siRNAs from the AtMu1 TIR corresponds to loss of asymmetric DNA methylation (Figure 4) from the likely promoter of AtMu1 based on the closely related Mutator family in maize (Raizada et al., 2001Raizada M.N. Benito M.I. Walbot V. The MuDR transposon terminal inverted repeat contains a complex plant promoter directing distinct somatic and germinal programs.Plant J. 2001; 25: 79-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, siRNAs from the epigenetically reactivated AtGP1 and Athila LTR retrotransposons (Figure S1) increased in relative abundance in pollen (Figure 5A). Retention of AtGP1 24nt siRNA corresponds to retention of DNA methylation in the LTR (Figure S6), and this TE is known to reactivate without loss of small RNAs (Lippman et al., 2003Lippman Z. May B. Yordan C. Singer T. Martienssen R. Distinct mechanisms determine transposon inheritance and methylation via small interfering RNA and histone modification.PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We noted the similarity between the pattern of TE siRNA accumulation in pollen and that observed in ddm1 mutants (Lippman et al., 2003Lippman Z. May B. Yordan C. Singer T. Martienssen R. Distinct mechanisms determine transposon inheritance and methylation via small interfering RNA and histone modification.PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This indicated that DDM1 might somehow be involved in this shift in siRNA accumulation. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced small RNA libraries from mature wild-type pollen, as well as from wild-type and ddm1 mutant inflorescences. A full analysis of the sequenced siRNAs will be presented elsewhere, and the data are displayed online at http://hispaniola.cshl.edu/annoj_slotkin2008_1/. Alignment of the sequenced siRNAs with TE sequences revealed a striking similarity between the siRNA in ddm1 mutants and mature pollen, each representing genomes with epigenetically reactivated TEs (Figure 5). Most TE families lose siRNAs when epigenetically reactivated in either ddm1 mutant plants or wild-type pollen. For example, the AtMu1a element (At4g08680) loses siRNAs in ddm1 (Lippman et al., 2003Lippman Z. May B. Yordan C. Singer T. Martienssen R. Distinct mechanisms determine transposon inheritance and methylation via small interfering RNA and histone modification.PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and has significantly reduced siRNAs in pollen (Figure 5). The two families of LTR retrotransposons shown in Figure 5A are the exception and gain siRNAs when epigenetically reactivated in ddm1 mutants and wild-type pollen. The AtGP1 family retains 24 nt siRNAs in both ddm1 and pollen, despite reactivation (Figure 5). This may reflect the presence of distinct classes of active and inactive AtGP1 elements in the genome. But the most striking effect in ddm1 and pollen is the massive increase in siRNA accumulation corresponding to the Athila family of LTR retrotransposons, which gain 21 nt siRNAs in both ddm1 mutants and mature pollen but have only low levels of 24 nt siRNAs in wild-type inflorescences (Figure 5). Therefore, the reactivation of diverse TEs in pollen is associated with the loss of most 24 nt siRNAs and the dramatic gain of some 21 nt TE siRNAs. TEs in pollen share several characteristics with TEs in ddm1 mutants: reduced DNA methylation, transcriptional reactivation, transposition, and selective loss and gain of siRNAs (Lippman et al., 2003Lippman Z. May B. Yordan C. Singer T. Martienssen R. Distinct mechanisms determine transposon inheritance and methylation via small interfering RNA and histone modification.PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, Singer et al., 2001Singer T. Yordan C. Martienssen R.A. Robertson's Mutator transposons in A. thaliana are regulated by the chromatin-remodeling gene Decrease in DNA Methylation (DDM1).Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This suggests that lack of DDM1 activity could be responsible, at least in part, for TE reactivation in pollen. However, DDM1 transcripts accumulate in pollen (Figure S7) and are enriched in SCs (Borges et al., 2008Borges F. Gomes G. Gardner R. Moreno N. McCormick S. Feijo J.A. Becker J.D. Comparative transcriptomics of Arabidopsis sperm cells.Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 1168-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To directly test whether the DDM1 protein is present in the pollen VN, we generated GFP protein fusions to the DDM1 coding region under control of the native DDM1 promoter. Six independent transgene insertions resulted in sperm-specific fluorescence (Figure 6 and Movies S1–S30), demonstrating that the DDM1 protein accumulates in the SCs to a much higher level compared to the VN, in which DDM1 protein accumulation is undetectable. In ddm1 mutants, centromeric repeats lose DNA methylation and are expressed (May et al., 2005May B.P. Lippman Z.B. Fang Y. Spector D.L. Martienssen R.A. Differential regulation of strand-specific transcripts from Arabidopsis centromeric satellite repeats.PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: e79Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Vongs et al., 1993Vongs A. Kakutani T. Martienssen R.A. Richards E.J. Arabidopsis thaliana DNA methylation mutants.Science. 1993; 260: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In each of the six independent transformants, the DDM1-GFP transgene resulted in centromeric and TE DNA methylation in the plant body, indicating that these transgene insertion events complement the ddm1-2 mutation (Figure S8). However, in contrast to ddm1 mutants, centromeric repeats do not show elevated expression in pollen compared to wild-type inflorescences (Figure S9), suggesting that centromeric satellite promoters are not active in pollen. Perhaps ddm1-induced expression of the centromeric repeats is dependent on centromere function and identity, as centromere-specific histone localization is lost in the pollen VN (Ingouff et al., 2007Ingouff M.

We conclude that the TE-specific reactivation in the VN is regulated, in whole or in part, by the lack of DDM1 protein.

We previously described direct reprogramming of adult mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) by Oct4 and either Klf4 or c-Myc. NSCs endogenously express Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 as well as several intermediate reprogramming markers. Here we report that exogenous expression of the germline-specific transcription factor Oct4 is sufficient to generate pluripotent stem cells from adult mouse NSCs. These one-factor induced pluripotent stem cells (1F iPS) are similar to embryonic stem cells in vitro and in vivo. Not only can these cells can be efficiently differentiated into NSCs, cardiomyocytes, and germ cells in vitro, but they are also capable of teratoma formation and germline transmission in vivo. Our results demonstrate that Oct4 is required and sufficient to directly reprogram NSCs to pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2078544177,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) not only interrupt the genetic information, but also disrupt the chromatin structure, and both impairments require repair mechanisms to ensure genome integrity. We showed previously that RNF8-mediated chromatin ubiquitylation protects genome integrity by promoting the accumulation of repair factors at DSBs. Here, we provide evidence that, while RNF8 is necessary to trigger the DSB-associated ubiquitylations, it is not sufficient to sustain conjugated ubiquitin in this compartment. We identified RNF168 as a novel chromatin-associated ubiquitin ligase with an ability to bind ubiquitin. We show that RNF168 interacts with ubiquitylated H2A, assembles at DSBs in an RNF8-dependent manner, and, by targeting H2A and H2AX, amplifies local concentration of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates to the threshold required for retention of 53BP1 and BRCA1. Thus, RNF168 defines a new pathway involving sequential ubiquitylations on damaged chromosomes and uncovers a functional cooperation between E3 ligases in genome maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2131827278,"The biological response to DNA double-strand breaks acts to preserve genome integrity. Individuals bearing inactivating mutations in components of this response exhibit clinical symptoms that include cellular radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and cancer predisposition. The archetype for such disorders is Ataxia-Telangiectasia caused by biallelic mutation in ATM, a central component of the DNA damage response. Here, we report that the ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is mutated in the RIDDLE syndrome, a recently discovered immunodeficiency and radiosensitivity disorder. We show that RNF168 is recruited to sites of DNA damage by binding to ubiquitylated histone H2A. RNF168 acts with UBC13 to amplify the RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitylation by targeting H2A-type histones and by promoting the formation of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates. These RNF168-dependent chromatin modifications orchestrate the accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to DNA lesions, and their loss is the likely cause of the cellular and developmental phenotypes associated with RIDDLE syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1992972287,"Hair follicles (HFs) undergo cyclic bouts of degeneration, rest, and regeneration. During rest (telogen), the hair germ (HG) appears as a small cell cluster between the slow-cycling bulge and dermal papilla (DP). Here we show that HG cells are derived from bulge stem cells (SCs) but become responsive quicker to DP-promoting signals. In vitro, HG cells also proliferate sooner but display shorter-lived potential than bulge cells. Molecularly, they more closely resemble activated bulge rather than transit-amplifying (matrix) cells. Transcriptional profiling reveals precocious activity of both HG and DP in late telogen, accompanied by Wnt signaling in HG and elevated FGFs and BMP inhibitors in DP. FGFs and BMP inhibitors participate with Wnts in exerting selective and potent stimuli to the HG both in vivo and in vitro. Our findings suggest a model where HG cells fuel initial steps in hair regeneration, while the bulge is the engine maintaining the process."

Chromosome bridges sustained Aurora B activity to posttelophase stages and thereby delayed abscission at stabilized intercellular canals. This was essential to suppress tetraploidization by furrow regression in a pathway further involving the phosphorylation of mitotic kinesin-like protein 1 (Mklp1).

The molecular requirements for cytokinesis.Science. 2005; 307: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Specifically, the completion of cytokinesis by abscission needs to await complete clearance of chromatin from the cleavage plane. While chromosome segregation normally completes early after anaphase onset, it can be severely delayed by lagging or bridged chromosomes. Such segregation defects have been estimated to occur in about 1% of dividing somatic cells, and at higher incidence in transformed cells (Cimini et al., 2003Cimini D. Mattiuzzo M. Torosantucci L.

The regulation of abscission timing in animal cells is poorly defined, but may be related to a recently discovered pathway in budding yeast, termed NoCut (Norden et al., 2006Norden C. Mendoza M. Dobbelaere J. Kotwaliwale C.V. Biggins S. Barral Y. The NoCut pathway links completion of cytokinesis to spindle midzone function to prevent chromosome breakage.Cell. 2006; 125: 85-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As part of this pathway, aurora kinase Ipl1 delays abscission in response to midspindle defects, which led to the hypothesis that it could monitor the completion of chromosome segregation for the control of abscission timing. It is not known if abscission timing is regulated at this level in higher eukaryotes. The vertebrate homolog of Ipl1, Aurora B, is essential for mitosis and cytokinesis (Eggert et al., 2006Eggert U.S. Mitchison T.J. Field C.M. Animal cytokinesis: from parts list to mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 543-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, Ruchaud et al., 2007Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Chromosomal passengers: conducting cell division.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Aurora B-dependent pathways regulating furrow ingression are well established. This includes Aurora B-dependent phosphorylation of mitotic kinesin-like protein 1 (Mklp1) (Guse et al., 2005Guse A. Mishima M. Glotzer M.

Cooperation between mitotic kinesins controls the late stages of cytokinesis.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Following furrow ingression, Aurora B localizes to the midbody (Ruchaud et al., 2007Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Chromosomal passengers: conducting cell division.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), but its potential regulation of abscission timing has not been investigated. Mklp1 also localizes to the midbody (Guse et al., 2005Guse A. Mishima M. Glotzer M. Phosphorylation of ZEN-4/MKLP1 by aurora B regulates completion of cytokinesis.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 778-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Neef et al., 2006Neef R. Klein U.R. Kopajtich R. Barr F.A. Cooperation between mitotic kinesins controls the late stages of cytokinesis.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Aurora B could regulate furrow ingression and abscission through common downstream effectors. Aurora B is regulated at many levels (Ruchaud et al., 2007Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Chromosomal passengers: conducting cell division.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). To become active, it requires association with its coactivator INCENP. Its activity further depends on autophosphorylation at a threonine 232 residue in its activation loop (Yasui et al., 2004Yasui Y. Urano T. Kawajiri A. Nagata K. Tatsuka M. Saya H. Furukawa K. Takahashi T. Izawa I. Inagaki M. Autophosphorylation of a newly identified site of Aurora-B is indispensable for cytokinesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12997-13003Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and as part of the chromosome passenger complex, it needs to be targeted to distinct subcellular locations during mitotic progression. Here, we established in vivo assays to investigate the regulation of abscission timing in human cells, and its coordination with the completion of chromosome segregation. We found that Aurora B inactivation at the midbody promotes abscission. Chromosome bridges delayed abscission and sustained Aurora B activity to posttelophase, which was essential to stabilize Mklp1 at the intercellular canal and to suppress furrow regression. Based on these data, we propose that Aurora B functions as part of a sensor that responds to unsegregated chromatin in the cleavage plane to control abscission timing and to protect missegregating cells against tetraploidization by furrow regression. Previous studies reached controversial conclusions to which extent chromosome bridges cause tetraploidization by cytokinesis failure (Mullins and Biesele, 1977Mullins J.M. Biesele J.J.

Because this could be due to the difficulty to reliably detect thin chromosome bridges by conventional wide field microscopy, we applied high resolution 3-D confocal time-lapse microscopy to monitor chromosome segregation and cleavage furrow ingression/regression in live cells. Using a HeLa cell line stably coexpressing markers for chromatin (H2B-mRFP [Keppler et al., 2006Keppler A. Arrivoli C. Sironi L. Ellenberg J. Fluorophores for live cell imaging of AGT fusion proteins across the visible spectrum.Biotechniques. 2006; 41 (172, 174–165): 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar]), and plasma membrane (MyrPalm-mEGFP [Zacharias et al., 2002Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Partitioning of lipid-modified monomeric GFPs into membrane microdomains of live cells.Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar]), we found that cytokinetic furrow ingression always completed within 20 min after anaphase onset (n = 774), both in cells without chromosome bridges (n = 728), as well as in all cells with chromosome bridges (n = 46). Subsequent furrow regression occurred exclusively in cells with chromosome bridges (n = 16 out of 774 imaged dividing cells; Figure 1A and Movie S1 available with this article online). The sensitivity for bridge detection was validated by counterstaining with Hoechst (100% of Hoechst bridges were detectable by H2B-mRFP; n = 43; data not shown). These observations support the hypothesis that chromatin trapped in the cleavage plane is a main cause for spontaneous cytokinesis failure in tissue culture cells (Mullins and Biesele, 1977Mullins J.M. Biesele J.J. Terminal phase of cytokinesis in D-98s cells.J. Cell Biol. 1977; 73: 672-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, Stewenius et al., 2005Stewenius Y. Gorunova L. Jonson T.

Cell biology: nondisjunction, aneuploidy and tetraploidy.Nature. 2006; 442: E9-E10Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To compare the incidence of furrow regression in missegregating cells to the overall rate of tetraploidization, we next assayed the other known mechanisms that can lead to tetraploidization (Ganem et al., 2007Ganem N.J. Storchova Z. Pellman D. Tetraploidy, aneuploidy and cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). First, we assayed in the same dataset cell-to-cell fusion to neighboring nonsister cells, and spontaneous mitotic slippage (mitotic exit without chromosome segregation and cytokinesis; see Figure S1A). Neither process ever occurred in the movies of 774 dividing cells, indicating that these events must be extremely rare. Next, we probed for endoreplication (multiple rounds of replication without intermediate mitosis). By long-term confocal time-lapse imaging of HeLa cells stably expressing H2B-mRFP and the replication factory marker mEGFP-PCNA (Leonhardt et al., 2000Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso M.C. Dynamics of DNA replication factories in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), we found that cells always progressed from early to late S-phase replication foci patterns and subsequently entered mitosis, never entering a second S-phase without preceding mitosis (n = 173; assay shown in Figure S1B). Thus, spontaneous endoreplication must also be extremely rare, if present at all in HeLa cells. Finally, multinucleate cells always had thin DNA threads coated by the inner nuclear envelope marker LAP2 connecting their individual nuclei (Figure S1C; n = 20). This is consistent with their origin from furrow regression after chromosome bridging, but would not be expected to result from any other known process leading to tetraploidization. Together, our data suggest that furrow regression in response to chromosome bridges is the main cause for tetraploidization in HeLa cells. Consistent with previous studies (Fujiwara et al., 2005Fujiwara T. Bandi M. Nitta M. Ivanova E.V. Bronson R.T. Pellman D. Cytokinesis failure generating tetraploids promotes tumorigenesis in p53-null cells.Nature. 2005; 437: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, Ganem et al., 2007Ganem N.J. Storchova Z. Pellman D. Tetraploidy, aneuploidy and cancer.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, Shi and King, 2005Shi Q. King R.W. Chromosome nondisjunction yields tetraploid rather than aneuploid cells in human cell lines.Nature. 2005; 437: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), we found by long-term imaging of HeLa cells stably expressing H2B-mRFP over 80 hr that cells that regressed the furrow frequently entered abnormal mitosis, which impaired their proliferation (Figures 1B, 1D, 1E, and S1D, and Movies S2 and S4). Remarkably, the majority of cells with chromosome bridges (71%; n = 143) did not regress the furrow and proliferated at rates close to normally segregating cells (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1E, and Movies S3 and S4). We thus asked if chromosome bridges resolve shortly after anaphase onset to allow unperturbed abscission. Gradual thinning of chromosome bridges during mitotic exit limits their detection by time-lapse imaging of chromatin markers. However, the inner nuclear envelope marker EGFP-LAP2β (Muhlhausser and Kutay, 2007Muhlhausser P. Kutay U. An in vitro nuclear disassembly system reveals a role for the RanGTPase system and microtubule-dependent steps in nuclear envelope breakdown.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which localized around chromatin from late anaphase on (Figure 2A and Movie S5), efficiently visualized chromosome bridges during subsequent cell cycle stages (LAP2β-bridges always correlated with chromosome bridges in high resolution still images; n = 10; Figure 2B). By time-lapse imaging, we found that the majority of chromosome bridges persisted long into interphase (76% for more than 5 hr; n = 46). The relatively low incidence of cleavage furrow regression is surprising with respect to the persistence of chromosome bridges, and could be due to a mechanism that delays abscission until eventual resolution of chromosome bridges. To address if chromosome bridges were correlated with delayed abscission, we probed for cytoplasmic continuity of postmitotic sister cells. HeLa cells expressing H2B-mCherry were scored for chromosome bridges during anaphase and then followed into interphase. A coexpressed photoactivatable GFP (PAGFP [Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. A photoactivatable GFP for selective photolabeling of proteins and cells.Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar]) was then photoactivated in one sister cell. Any subsequent increase of PAGFP fluorescence in the nonactivated sister cell reports on diffusion between the two cells, indicating that abscission had not taken place. While all normally segregating sister cells had undergone abscission 180 min after anaphase onset (n = 25 pairs of sister cells; Figure 2C), the majority of chromosome bridge-containing sister cells (86%, n = 29; Figure 2D) at that time were still connected by cytoplasmic canals that allowed PAGFP diffusion into the nonactivated sister cell. To test if in these cells abscission can occur at later interphase stages, we combined long-term time-lapse imaging of mRFP-LAP2β with the PAGFP assay (Figure S2). All cells that resolved the chromosome bridge had abscised prior to photoactivation (n = 14). In contrast, only a single out of 21 pairs of sister cells with intact chromosome bridges failed to exchange PAGFP. Together, these data demonstrate that chromosome bridges delay abscission. To test if resolution of chromosome bridges directly leads to abscission, we established a protocol to remove chromosome bridges from the abscission site by intracellular laser microsurgery. Using HeLa cells stably coexpressing mRFP-LAP2β and MyrPalm-mEGFP as markers for the chromosome bridge and the plasma membrane, we first validated that laser cutting of the chromosome bridge at cytoplasmic regions close to the nucleus (minimum distance from ingressed furrow 1.3 μm; mean distance 2.9 μm) did not affect the overall integrity of the sister cells (n = 9; Figure 2E). Next, we cut the chromosome bridge in cells stably coexpressing mRFP-LAP2β and PAGFP. In 6 out of 12 cells this led to complete removal of the bridge from the cytoplasmic canal connecting the sister cells (Figure 2F). By subsequent photoactivation of PAGFP in one sister cell and time-lapse imaging over 65 min we found that all cells with removed chromosome bridges had undergone abscission. This was unlikely due to simple mechanical separation of the entire sister cells by the laser cutting procedure, as the cutting path was at least 1.5 μm (mean distance 2.7 μm) displaced from the ingressed furrow, similar to the experiment shown in Figure 2E, which did not show any detectable changes in the morphology of the plasma membranes between sister cells 2 min (Figure 2E), as well as 30 min (data not shown) after laser microsurgery. To further test for the specificity of abscission in response to removal of the chromosome bridge, rather than potential unrelated cellular damage by the laser cutting procedure, we applied the same protocol with the laser cutting path slightly displaced from the chromosome bridge (Figure 2G). Only one out of 11 cells treated by this control procedure underwent abscission after laser microsurgery, as scored by the PAGFP assay. To exclude the possibility that the slightly different orientation of the laser cutting path relative to the abscission site affected the outcome of this experiment, we also tested if laser microsurgery would lead to abscission in telophase cells (Figure 2H). The cutting path was similar to that applied in cells with chromosomal bridges, with a minimum distance of 1.2 μm (mean distance 2.1 μm) from the ingressed furrow. In 12 out of 13 pairs of sister cells, PAGFP still exchanged 10 min after laser microsurgery, demonstrating that the laser microsurgery procedure per se does not cause abscission. We conclude that removal of chromatin from the cleavage plane leads to abscission. The ingressed cleavage furrow is normally anchored at the midbody. The disassembly of midbody microtubule bundles defines the end of telophase, which normally coincides with abscission (see below). Midbody disassembly proceeds by sequential disassembly of microtubule bundles on either side of a central midbody region, which subsequently persists as a midbody remnant (Figures S3A and S3B). We were thus surprised to note that despite of the abscission delay, chromosome bridge-containing HeLa cells disassembled midbody microtubule bundles already 60 ± 9 min (mean ± SD; n = 19; Figure 3A and Movie S6) after furrow ingression, similar to normally segregating cells (60 ± 10 min; n = 12; Figure S3B and Movie S7). To investigate if other cytoskeletal structures could contribute to the stabilization of intercellular canals in cells with chromosome bridges, we visualized actin in vivo using a HeLa cell line stably coexpressing actin-EGFP and H2B-mRFP. We found that in normally segregating cells actin enriched at the ingressing cleavage furrow, where it remained until 61 ± 11 min (n = 12; Figure S3C and Movie S8). The disappearance of actin-EGFP accumulations from the ingressed furrow thus correlated with the time of midbody microtubule disassembly and abscission (compare with Figures S3C, 5E, and 5F). Cells containing chromosome bridges did not disassemble actin-EGFP at that time, but instead accumulated actin-EGFP at two prominent patches on either side of the cytoplasmic canal (Figure 3B, Movie S9; patches detected in 90% of chromosome bridge-containing cells; n = 166; never in cells without chromosome bridges; n = 45). Actin patches could also be visualized by phalloidin (Figure S3D) and remained stable throughout interphase (Figure S3E and Movie S10), and disappeared only when chromosome bridges resolved (Figures 3C, S3F, and Movie S11; n = 18), or the cleavage furrow regressed (Figure 3D and Movie S12; n = 46). Thus, missegregating cells delay abscission at stable actin-rich canals. Abscission delay and assembly of stable intercellular canals induced by chromosome bridges could be a constitutive cellular response to the presence of a mechanical barrier. Alternatively, it could specifically depend on the presence of chromatin at the cleavage site. To discriminate between these possibilities, we introduced mechanical barriers at the cleavage site that did not contain chromatin. Asbestos fibers, which have similar dimensions as chromosome bridges (Fig. S4A, B), efficiently incorporate into dividing cells (Jensen et al., 1996Jensen C.G. Jensen L.C. Rieder C.L. Cole R.W. Ault J.G. Long crocidolite asbestos fibers cause polyploidy by sterically blocking cytokinesis.Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Localization of asbestos fibers to cytoplasmic regions close to the ingressing cleavage furrow did not perturb furrow ingression (n = 84; Figure 4A and Movie S13) and midbody assembly (n = 23; Figure 4B). Cells with asbestos fibers at the ingressed furrow never contained actin accumulations at the intercellular canal (Figure 4C; n = 13; compare Figure S3D), and frequently regressed the furrow very early after telophase (62% within 3 hr after furrow ingression; n = 84; detected by confocal time-lapse imaging; Figure 4A and Movie S13). However, furrow regression never occurred when intracellular asbestos fibers were not trapped by the ingressed furrow (n = 42; Figure S4C), demonstrating that rapid furrow regression depended on the specific localization of asbestos fibers. Together, these data indicate that mechanical blockage at the abscission site is not sufficient to sustain a stable intercellular canal. The regulation of abscission timing in animal cells is unknown, but in S. cerevisiae depends on the inactivation of the aurora kinase Ipl1 (Norden et al., 2006Norden C. Mendoza M. Dobbelaere J. Kotwaliwale C.V. Biggins S. Barral Y. The NoCut pathway links completion of cytokinesis to spindle midzone function to prevent chromosome breakage.Cell. 2006; 125: 85-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We thus investigated if this function is conserved in the mammalian Ipl1 homolog, Aurora B. Aurora B did not change its localization upon midbody microtubule disassembly (Figure S5A), which normally coincides with abscission (see below). It persisted at high levels on the midbody remnant, a structure that becomes visible after abscission (detected on midbody remnant by immunofluorescence in 49/50 cells; Figures 5A and 5B; by time-lapse imaging of Aurora B-EGFP during midbody disassembly; Figure S5A). It is therefore unlikely that sub-cellular localization changes or degradation of Aurora B contribute to abscission control. Aurora B activity depends on phosphorylation of a T232 residue (Yasui et al., 2004Yasui Y. Urano T. Kawajiri A. Nagata K. Tatsuka M. Saya H. Furukawa K. Takahashi T. Izawa I. Inagaki M. Autophosphorylation of a newly identified site of Aurora-B is indispensable for cytokinesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12997-13003Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Using an antibody specifically recognizing phospho-T232-Aurora B, we found midbody-localized Aurora B always highly phosphorylated (n = 20; Figure 5C), suggesting that Aurora B remains active throughout entire telophase. The antibody was specific, as inhibition of Aurora B by ZM1 (Girdler et al., 2006Girdler F. Gascoigne K.E. Eyers P.A. Hartmuth S. Crafter C. Foote K.M. Keen N.J. Taylor S.S. Validating Aurora B as an anti-cancer drug target.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3664-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) removed all detectable phospho-T232 Aurora B from late midbodies (Fig. S5B-C). Midbody remnants never contained significant amounts of phospho-T232-Aurora B (0.8 ± 1.3% of telophase levels; n = 20; Figure 5D). The correlation of Aurora B dephosphorylation with midbody microtubule disassembly suggests that Aurora B inactivation may provide a trigger for abscission. To directly test this, we examined the effect of premature Aurora B inactivation during telophase in HeLa cells stably coexpressing mCherry-α-tubulin and PAGFP. By repetitive photoactivation of PAGFP in one postmitotic sister cell, and measuring increase of fluorescence in the other sister cell over time, we determined the precise timing of abscission (Figures 5E–5G, and Movie S14). In normally segregating HeLa cells abscission occurred 60 ± 10 min (mean ± SD; n = 12) after complete cleavage furrow ingression."

We show here that telomeres are elongated in iPS cells compared to the parental differentiated cells both when using four (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc) or three (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4) reprogramming factors and both from young and aged individuals. We demonstrate genetically that, during reprogramming, telomere elongation is usually mediated by telomerase and that iPS telomeres acquire the epigenetic marks of ES cells, including a low density of trimethylated histones H3K9 and H4K20 and increased abundance of telomere transcripts. Finally, reprogramming efficiency of cells derived from increasing generations of telomerase-deficient mice shows a dramatic decrease in iPS cell efficiency, a defect that is restored by telomerase reintroduction. Together, these results highlight the importance of telomere biology for iPS cell generation and functionality.

These factors include Oct3/4 (also called Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc; the latter was found dispensable for iPS cell generation (Nakagawa et al., 2008Nakagawa M. Koyanagi M. Tanabe K. Takahashi K.

Although full characterization of iPS cells is still in progress, iPS cells seem to have the same properties as embryonic stem (ES) cells and share with them a similar global gene expression pattern, including a correct genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K.

In the case of regenerative transplantation therapies, these findings open the possibility of using iPS cells derived from patients as a way to bypass the technical difficulties, as well as ethical controversies, associated with the alternative method of nuclear transfer to human oocytes, in vitro generation of preimplantation embryos, and obtention of ES cells. Telomeres have been shown to shorten associated to increasing age (Harley et al., 1990Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Telomeres shorten during ageing of human fibroblasts.Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4390) Google Scholar) and contribute to organismal aging by limiting the proliferative capacity of adult stem cells (Blasco, 2007aBlasco M.A. Telomere length, stem cells and aging.Nat.

Although telomerase activity has been found upregulated in both human and mouse iPS cells (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

For example, telomerase is reactivated in human cancers; however, the telomeres of most cancer cells are shorter than those of normal tissues (de Lange et al., 1990de Lange T. Shiue L. Myers R.M. Cox D.R. Naylor S.L. Killery A.M. Varmus H.E. Structure and variability of human chromosome ends.Mol. Cell.

Pathol. 2004; 164: 925-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Telomeres are ribonucleoprotein heterochromatic structures at the ends of chromosomes that protect them from degradation and recombination activities (Blackburn, 2001Blackburn E.H. Switching and signaling at the telomere.Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Telomeres consist of tandem repeats of the TTAGGG sequence bound to a 6 protein complex known as shelterin (Blackburn, 2001Blackburn E.H. Switching and signaling at the telomere.Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar, de Lange, 2005de Lange T. Shelterin: The protein complex that shapes and safeguards human telomeres.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). Telomere length is influenced by changes in the activity of telomerase, the reverse transcriptase that elongates telomeres (Greider and Blackburn, 1985Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Identification of a specific telomere terminal transferase activity in Tetrahymena extracts.Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar), as well as by the so-called alternative lengthening of telomeres or ALT pathway, which relays in homologous recombination between telomeric sequences (Dunham et al., 2000Dunham M.A. Neumann A.A. Fasching C.L. Reddel R.R. Telomere maintenance by recombination in human cells.Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). In turn, these telomere-elongating mechanisms are regulated by the epigenetic status of telomeric chromatin (Blasco, 2007bBlasco M.A. The epigenetic regulation of mammalian telomeres.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In particular, both telomeric and subtelomeric repeats are enriched in histone methylation marks characteristic of repressed heterochromatic domains such as trimethylation of H3K9 and H4K20, and they show binding of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (García-Cao et al., 2004García-Cao M.

In addition, the DNA of subtelomeric repeats is heavily methylated (Gonzalo et al., 2006Gonzalo S. Jaco I. Fraga M.F. Chen T. Li E. Esteller M. Blasco M.A. DNA methyltransferases control telomere length and telomere recombination in mammalian cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Loss of these epigenetic marks results in derepression of telomere recombination and telomere elongation (García-Cao et al., 2004García-Cao M. O'Sullivan R. Peters A.H. Jenuwein T.

Furthermore, telomeres are transcribed, and the resulting UUAGGG-rich RNAs (TelRNAs or TERRAs) remain bound to the telomeric chromatin, where they are proposed to regulate telomere length (Azzalin et al., 2007Azzalin C.M.

Telomerase is expressed during embryonic development and in the stem cell compartment of several adult tissues (Blasco, 2007aBlasco M.A. Telomere length, stem cells and aging.Nat. Chem.

Further evidence for a role of telomerase and telomere length in organ homeostasis comes from the study of telomerase-deficient mice (Terc−/− mice), which show premature aging and a decreased proliferative potential of adult stem cell populations (Blasco et al., 1997Blasco M.A. Lee H.W.

Therefore, the functionality of iPS cells could be limited in elderly patients or in patients with a limited telomere reserve, and the resulting iPS cells could inherit telomeric defects, including suboptimal telomere length. In this regard, previous studies with cloned animals by means of somatic cell nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes have rendered contradictory results regarding whether telomeres are elongated or not during nuclear reprogramming (Shiels et al., 1999Shiels P.G.

On one hand, the cloned sheep Dolly showed abnormally short telomeres, something that was attributed to the adult origin of the donor nucleus (Shiels et al., 1999Shiels P.G. Kind A.J. Campbell K.H. Wilmut I. Waddington D. Colman A. Schnieke A.E. Analysis of telomere lengths in cloned sheep.Nature. 1999; 399: 316-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), whereas cloning of cattle or mice for six generations had no notable effect on telomere length (Lanza et al., 2000Lanza R.P.

Perry A.C. et al.Cloning of mice to six generations.Nature. 2000; 407: 318-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Finally, it is known that, soon after fertilization but previous to the formation of the blastocyst, telomeres are elongated by a telomerase-independent recombination-based mechanism (Liu et al., 2007Liu L. Bailey S.M. Okuka M. Muñoz P. Li C. Zhou L. Wu C. Czerwiec E. Sandler L. Seyfang A. et al.Telomere lengthening early in development.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1436-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This opens several scenarios for the reprogramming of telomeric chromatin, including dispensability of telomerase for telomere elongation, cooperation between telomerase-based and recombination-based mechanisms, and, finally, complete dependence on telomerase for telomere elongation during reprogramming. Here, we show that both telomere length and telomere heterochromatic marks acquire ES cell features during iPS cell generation. Importantly, we show here that telomeres are also efficiently elongated in iPS cells derived from old animals, demonstrating that telomeres can be efficiently rejuvenated during nuclear reprogramming. Interestingly, we show that telomerase activity is the primary mechanism to mediate telomere re-elongation during reprogramming and that a minimum telomere length is necessary for iPS cell generation. In particular, cells derived from telomerase-deficient mice fail to properly elongate telomeres during reprogramming, and telomeres continue to shorten during iPS cell generation. Furthermore, an increasing number of generations of telomerase-deficient mice with progressive shorter telomeres show a dramatic impairment in iPS cell generation. These findings highlight the importance of telomere biology for the generation and proper functionality of iPS cells. Telomerase activity has been previously shown to increase during iPS cell generation using a combination of four reprogramming factors (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M.

https://openalex.org/W1974706661,"In G(0) and G(1), DNA double strand breaks are repaired by nonhomologous end joining, whereas in S and G(2), they are also repaired by homologous recombination. The human CtIP protein controls double strand break (DSB) resection, an event that occurs effectively only in S/G(2) and that promotes homologous recombination but not non-homologous end joining. Here, we mutate a highly conserved cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) target motif in CtIP and reveal that mutating Thr-847 to Ala impairs resection, whereas mutating it to Glu to mimic constitutive phosphorylation does not. Moreover, we show that unlike cells expressing wild-type CtIP, cells expressing the Thr-to-Glu mutant resect DSBs even after CDK inhibition. Finally, we establish that Thr-847 mutations to either Ala or Glu affect DSB repair efficiency, cause hypersensitivity toward DSB-generating agents, and affect the frequency and nature of radiation-induced chromosomal rearrangements. These results suggest that CDK-mediated control of resection in human cells operates by mechanisms similar to those recently established in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1970309962,"The genetic programs that promote retention of self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSCs) at the apex of cellular hierarchies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are not known. In a mouse model of human AML, LSCs exhibit variable frequencies that correlate with the initiating MLL oncogene and are maintained in a self-renewing state by a transcriptional subprogram more akin to that of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) than to that of adult stem cells. The transcription/chromatin regulatory factors Myb, Hmgb3, and Cbx5 are critical components of the program and suffice for Hoxa/Meis-independent immortalization of myeloid progenitors when coexpressed, establishing the cooperative and essential role of an ESC-like LSC maintenance program ancillary to the leukemia-initiating MLL/Hox/Meis program. Enriched expression of LSC maintenance and ESC-like program genes in normal myeloid progenitors and poor-prognosis human malignancies links the frequency of aberrantly self-renewing progenitor-like cancer stem cells (CSCs) to prognosis in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2031291041,"The potentially deleterious effects of aberrant mRNA lacking a termination codon (nonstop mRNA) are ameliorated by translation arrest, proteasome-mediated protein destabilization, and rapid mRNA degradation. Because polylysine synthesis via translation of the poly(A) mRNA tail leads to translation arrest and protein degradation by the proteasome, we examined the effects of other amino acid sequences. Insertion of 12 consecutive basic amino acids between GFP and HIS3 reporter genes, but not a stem-loop structure, resulted in degradation of the truncated green fluorescent protein (GFP) products by the proteasome. Translation arrest products derived from GFP-R12-FLAG-HIS3 or GFP-K12-FLAG-HIS3 mRNA were detected in a not4Delta mutant, and MG132 treatment did not affect the levels of the truncated arrest products. Deletion of other components of the Ccr4-Not complex did not increase the levels of the translation arrest products or reporter mRNAs. A L35A substitution in the Not4p RING finger domain, which disrupted its interaction with the Ubc4/Ubc5 E2 enzyme and its activity as an ubiquitin-protein ligase, also abrogated the degradation of arrest products. These results suggest that Not4p, a component of the Ccr4-Not complex, may act as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase for translation arrest products. The results let us propose that the interaction between basic amino acid residues and the negatively charged exit tunnel of the ribosome leads to translation arrest followed by Not4p-mediated ubiquitination and protein degradation by the proteasome."
https://openalex.org/W1968895930,"Both seasonal and pandemic influenza continue to challenge both scientists and clinicians. Drug-resistant H1N1 influenza viruses have dominated the 2009 flu season, and the H5N1 avian influenza virus continues to kill both people and poultry in Eurasia. Here, we discuss the pathogenesis and transmissibility of influenza viruses and we emphasize the need to find better predictors of both seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza. Both seasonal and pandemic influenza continue to challenge both scientists and clinicians. Drug-resistant H1N1 influenza viruses have dominated the 2009 flu season, and the H5N1 avian influenza virus continues to kill both people and poultry in Eurasia. Here, we discuss the pathogenesis and transmissibility of influenza viruses and we emphasize the need to find better predictors of both seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza. Influenza is historically an ancient disease that causes annual epidemics and, at irregular intervals, pandemics. Seasonal influenza kills 36,000 persons annually in the United States. The impact of seasonal influenza caused by a virus showing antigenic variation in the major viral glycoproteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) can be moderated by antigenically matched vaccines and anti-influenza drugs. The consequences of continuing genetic variation in seasonal influenza viruses are apparent in the current and prior influenza seasons. Despite intensive global surveillance, the H3N2 vaccine in the 2007–2008 season imperfectly matched the virus that emerged between vaccine selection and its use (6 months). In the current influenza season, the H1N1 virus that has become dominant is resistant to the anti-influenza drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Pandemics that occur at irregular intervals can vary in severity from mild to catastrophic. The pandemics of the past century include the catastrophic H1N1 Spanish influenza of 1918 (more than 50 million deaths globally), the H2N2 Asian flu of 1957 (more than 1 million deaths globally), and the H3N2 Hong Kong flu of 1968 (∼0.5 million deaths globally). The natural reservoirs of these influenza A viruses are aquatic birds, and the spread of influenza to humans occurs either by direct transmission (Spanish influenza) or by reassortment between the segmented RNA genomes of avian and human influenza viruses (the Asian and Hong Kong pandemics). Although we know the general mechanisms by which new influenza viruses emerge, our basic knowledge of how these viruses acquire human pandemic potential is minimal, and our molecular understanding of the virus and the host factors involved in successful transmission and spread is rudimentary. A highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has been circulating for more than a decade in Eurasia and has spread to more than 60 countries. It has infected 394 humans killing 248, with recent deaths reported in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Egypt. The occasional direct transmission of the virus to humans and its lethality suggest the possibility of a pandemic akin to the 1918 Spanish flu if consistent human-to-human transmission is achieved. We argue that it is premature to become complacent, and we identify research directions in influenza virus ecology and the molecular biology of pathogenesis and transmission that should enable the development of better predictors of seasonal and pandemic influenza and increased preparedness (Figure 1). The 16 hemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes of influenza A virus are perpetuated in aquatic birds, in which they cause no apparent disease (Peiris et al., 2007Peiris J.S. de Jong M.D. Guan Y. Avian influenza virus (H5N1): a threat to human health.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2007; 20: 243-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Only viruses of the H5 and H7 hemagglutinin subtypes can become highly pathogenic after transmission to alternative hosts. Each of the H5 and H7 lineages that are lethal to domestic poultry originated from nonpathogenic precursor viruses of Eurasian and American lineages (Alexander, 2007Alexander D.J. An overview of the epidemiology of avian influenza.Vaccine. 2007; 25: 5637-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). However, until 1996, highly pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses either were eradicated or failed to persist in nature. Today, it is unknown whether the ecology of these viruses has changed and whether highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses continue to be propagated in domestic or wild bird reservoirs. The continued circulation of Asian H5N1 viruses of multiple clades (at least 10 different clades) and subclades is unprecedented. The available evidence suggests that all of the pandemic influenza virus strains, including the Spanish 1918 (H1N1), Asian 1957 (H2N2), and Hong Kong 1968 (H3N2) viruses, originated from the avian influenza reservoir either by reassortment (swapping of viral genetic information in hosts coinfected with more than one influenza virus) or direct transfer (Kobasa et al., 2004Kobasa D. Takada A. Shinya K. Hatta M. Halfmann P. Theriault S. Suzuki H. Nishimura H. Mitamura K. Sugaya N. et al.Enhanced virulence of influenza A viruses with the haemagglutinin of the 1918 pandemic virus.Nature. 2004; 431: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Influenza outbreaks in domestic animals, including poultry, also originate from the avian reservoir. Our knowledge of the precursors of pandemic and panzootic influenza viruses is extremely limited. The available information indicates that viruses in their natural reservoirs undergo limited evolution, replicate primarily in the intestinal and respiratory tracts, and change their predominant subtypes every 2 years (Fouchier et al., 2003Fouchier R.A. Osterhaus A.D. Brown I.H. Animal influenza virus surveillance.Vaccine. 2003; 21: 1754-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the genomics of influenza viruses in this natural reservoir is fragmentary, and evidence suggests that there is continuing reassortment in nature (Dugan et al., 2008Dugan V.G. Chen R.

Analysis of the multiple lineages of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses supports the contention that all of them arose in Southeast Asia (Kilpatrick et al., 2006Kilpatrick A.M. Chmura A.A. Gibbons D.W.

For example, the H5N1 virus that emerged at Qinghai Lake, China spread (probably in wild birds) to Europe, Africa, and India (Li et al., 2004Li K.S. Guan Y. Wang J. Smith G.J. Xu K.M. Duan L. Rahardjo A.P. Puthavathana P. Buranathai C. Nguyen T.D. et al.Genesis of a highly pathogenic and potentially pandemic H5N1 influenza virus in eastern Asia.Nature. 2004; 430: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Similarly, the lineage that spread to Indonesia can be traced to China's Hunan Province (Wang et al., 2008Wang J. Vijaykrishna D. Duan L. Bahl J. Zhang J.X. Webster R.G. Peiris J.S. Chen H. Smith G.J. Guan Y. Identification of the progenitors of Indonesia and Vietnam avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses from southern China.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3405-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The domestic duck may be the “Trojan horse” of the H5N1 viruses, for many ducks show no signs of disease yet shed virus for up to 17 days after infection and propagate influenza virus antigenic variants with low pathogenicity (Hulse et al., 2005Hulse D.J. Sturm-Ramirez K.M. Humbred J. Seiler P. Govorkova E.A. Krauss S. Scholtissek C. Puthavathana P. Buranathai C. Nguyen T.D. et al.Role of domestic ducks in the propagation and biological evolution of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses in Asia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 10682-10687Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). This hypothesis will be resolved only by detailed molecular epidemiological studies. To date, there is no influenza surveillance system in lower animals and birds that is comparable to the well-organized, interactive Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) for human influenza. The pandemic threat of H5N1 influenza has resulted in closer collaborations between international agricultural and human health organizations. However, the lack of a counterpart of GISN at the human-animal interface is a serious shortfall in pandemic preparedness. A genomic library of all subtypes of influenza viruses in wild and domestic birds, continuously updated by high-throughput sequencing and analysis, is badly needed to identify predictors of pandemics. Influenza viruses probably undergo genetic changes to spread from the wild bird reservoir to other hosts. Such changes are facilitated when multiple species of birds and mammals are housed in close proximity in live animal markets (Webster, 2004Webster R.G. Wet markets–a continuing source of severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza?.Lancet. 2004; 363: 234-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether influenza viruses are transmitted directly from natural reservoirs to mammals, including humans. Notably, chickens are not susceptible to most of the low-pathogenicity subtypes, including nonpathogenic H5 and H7 strains, without adaptation (Swayne, 2007Swayne D.E. Understanding the complex pathobiology of high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses in birds.Avian Dis. 2007; 51: 242-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of intermediate hosts, including the quail and the pig, has been suggested (Matrosovich et al., 1999Matrosovich M. Zhou N. Kawaoka Y. Webster R. The surface glycoproteins of H5 influenza viruses isolated from humans, chickens, and wild aquatic birds have distinguishable properties.J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1146-1155PubMed Google Scholar), but there is no smoking gun. A suggested transmission scenario might follow this sequence: wild waterfowl → domestic waterfowl → quail/pig → chicken → human. All of these birds and some mammals are found in various live markets. Information about the molecular profiles that permit transmission between these species is emerging (Perez et al., 2003Perez D.R. Lim W. Seiler J.P. Yi G. Peiris M. Shortridge K.F. Webster R.G. Role of quail in the interspecies transmission of H9 influenza A viruses: molecular changes on HA that correspond to adaptation from ducks to chickens.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3148-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but there is much still to learn. Expansion of the host range of the Asian H5N1 avian influenza virus to felines, viverrids, stone martens, and dogs has been associated with high pathogenicity and systemic spread (Rimmelzwaan et al., 2006Rimmelzwaan G.F. van Riel D. Baars M. Bestebroer T.M. van Amerongen G. Fouchier R.A. Osterhaus A.D. Kuiken T.

Extension of the host range to felid species remains to be elucidated at the molecular level; if domestic cats can serve as intermediate hosts, their infection would promote the selection of variants transmissible to humans. The pig may be an intermediate host for interspecies spread; the replication of all avian viruses in pigs supports this notion, as does the presence of avian-type and mammalian-type virus receptors in pigs (Ludwig et al., 1995Ludwig S. Stitz L. Planz O. Van H. Fitch W.M. Scholtissek C. European swine virus as a possible source for the next influenza pandemic?.Virology. 1995; 212: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The periodic transmission of avian influenza viruses to pigs in the absence of disease and the spread of human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to pigs (Ma et al., 2007Ma W. Vincent A.L. Gramer M.R. Brockwell C.B. Lager K.M. Janke B.H. Gauger P.C. Patnayak D.P. Webby R.J. Richt J.A. Identification of H2N3 influenza A viruses from swine in the United States.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 20949-20954Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) are also consistent with the “mixing-vessel” hypothesis, but to date the pig has not been directly implicated in the generation of pandemic influenza viruses. A major enigma of influenza virus is whether alteration of viral specificity for host cell receptors (sialic acids) can generate a pandemic strain of virus. The viral hemagglutinin surface glycoprotein preferentially binds to certain sialic acid residues on host cells, making hemagglutinin a determinant of host range. Specific amino acid changes in hemagglutinin have been identified as important in sialic acid receptor specificity and pathogenicity (Matrosovich et al., 1999Matrosovich M. Zhou N. Kawaoka Y.

The hemagglutinin of human influenza virus isolates typically binds preferentially to α2,6-linked sialic acids, whereas that of avian influenza virus isolates has a higher affinity for α2,3-linked sialic acids (Ito, 2000Ito T.

Interestingly, sialic acid receptors are distributed differently in the respiratory tracts of humans and other host species (Matrosovich et al., 2004Matrosovich M.N. Matrosovich T.Y. Gray T. Roberts N.A. Klenk H.D. Human and avian influenza viruses target different cell types in cultures of human airway epithelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Pathol. 2007; 171: 1215-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The human and ferret upper respiratory tract, believed to be the primary site of influenza infection, carries primarily α2,6-linked sialic acids, which gives human viral isolates a binding advantage. Receptor specificity must be studied at the level of the cell type to discern the relative susceptibility of cells to infection on the basis of sialic acid expression. This information will be of particular interest, as some H5N1 viruses cause systemic infection, including infection of brain cells. Notably, the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic strains all preferentially bind to α2,6-linked sialic acids (Stevens et al., 2006aStevens J. Blixt O. Glaser L. Taubenberger J.K. Palese P. Paulson J.C. Wilson I.A. Glycan microarray analysis of the hemagglutinins from modern and pandemic influenza viruses reveals different receptor specificities.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), and so preferential affinity for these receptors may be necessary for emergence of a pandemic strain carrying an avian-derived hemagglutinin gene. However, avian isolates that bind preferentially to α2,3-linked sialic acids are lethal in humans and mammals and replicate well in the upper respiratory tract. Thus, it remains an open question whether H5N1 viruses must acquire specificity for binding to α2,6-linked sialic acids to become pandemic. Interestingly, cultured human respiratory epithelial cells lacking α2,3-linked sialic acids could be infected ex vivo with H5N1 viruses (Nicholls et al., 2007Nicholls J.M. Chan M.C. Chan W.Y. Wong H.K. Cheung C.Y. Kwong D.L. Wong M.P. Chui W.H. Poon L.L. Tsao S.W. et al.Tropism of avian influenza A (H5N1) in the upper and lower respiratory tract.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This finding together with advances in glycan array technology (Stevens et al., 2006aStevens J. Blixt O. Glaser L. Taubenberger J.K. Palese P. Paulson J.C. Wilson I.A. Glycan microarray analysis of the hemagglutinins from modern and pandemic influenza viruses reveals different receptor specificities.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) suggest that receptor specificity may involve factors other than binding to α2,3-linked and α2,6-linked sialic acids. However, the biological relevance of receptor binding particularly for viral entry, replication, spread, tissue tropism, and transmission still needs to be determined. What other viral factors increase the virulence or transmission of influenza virus, and by what mechanism? Certain H5N1 viruses with a hemagglutinin that preferentially binds to α2,3-linked sialic acids replicate in humans and can be lethal, suggesting that genes other than that encoding hemagglutinin are crucial for virulence. The replication efficiency of influenza virus correlates with its virulence. Specific amino acid sequences encoded by the polymerase genes alone are sufficient to make a virus lethal in animal models (Gabriel et al., 2005Gabriel G. Dauber B. Wolff T. Planz O. Klenk H.D.

Med. 2006; 203: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The best-described marker of pathogenicity is lysine at position 627 of polymerase subunit protein PB2 (Hatta et al., 2001Hatta M.

Murphy B.R. A single amino acid in the PB2 gene of influenza A virus is a determinant of host range.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1761-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This residue enhances the growth efficiency of avian H5N1 viruses in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of mice. As the importance of specific polymerase residues to lethality is identified, it will be crucial to elucidate the mechanism by which these residues affect replication efficiency. Each of the eight negative-sense RNA segments of influenza virus is transcribed into mRNA by the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex comprised of the PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins (Figure 2). Crystal structures of portions of the RNP complex have already shed light on how these proteins work (He et al., 2008He X. Zhou J. Bartlam M. Zhang R. Ma J. Lou Z. Li X. Li J. Joachimiak A. Zeng Z. et al.Crystal structure of the polymerase PA(C)-PB1(N) complex from an avian influenza H5N1 virus.Nature. 2008; 454: 1123-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Noda et al., 2006Noda T.

Architecture of ribonucleoprotein complexes in influenza A virus particles.Nature. 2006; 439: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). However, more biochemical research into the structure of the complex is needed to reveal why certain residues affect the interaction of the polymerase proteins, viral RNA, and host proteins. Elucidating how receptor specificity and polymerase-driven replication affect the pathogenicity and transmission of H5N1 viruses will yield important clues about host adaptation, pandemic potential, and the development of antiviral drugs. What are the requirements for human-to-human transmission of a potentially pandemic highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, and what mechanisms are involved? The absence of efficient human-to-human transmission of H5N1 viruses to date may explain why the circulating avian influenza virus has not caused a pandemic. Ferrets, which are naturally susceptible to influenza, have been used as a model to investigate transmission of H5N1 viruses. In both humans and ferrets, respiratory epithelial cells express primarily α2,6-linked sialic acids, H5N1 viruses bind preferentially to epithelial cells in the lower respiratory tract, and infection causes acute respiratory illness (Matrosovich et al., 2004Matrosovich M.N. Matrosovich T.Y. Gray T. Roberts N.A. Klenk H.D. Human and avian influenza viruses target different cell types in cultures of human airway epithelium.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4620-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, Shinya et al., 2006Shinya K. Ebina M. Yamada S. Ono M. Kasai N. Kawaoka Y.

Rimmelzwaan G.F. Fouchier R.A. Osterhaus A.D. Kuiken T. Human and avian influenza viruses target different cells in the lower respiratory tract of humans and other mammals.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 171: 1215-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Pathogenic H5N1 virus was not transmitted from infected to contact ferrets regardless of the α2,3- or α2,6-linked sialic acid receptor binding affinity (Yen et al., 2007bYen H.L. Lipatov A.S. Ilyushina N.A. Govorkova E.A. Franks J. Yilmaz N. Douglas A. Hay A. Krauss S. Rehg J.E. et al.Inefficient transmission of H5N1 influenza viruses in a ferret contact model.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6890-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In another study, acquisition of the surface glycoproteins of efficiently transmissible H3N2 human influenza viruses did not alter transmission of poorly transmissible H5N1 avian viruses (Maines et al., 2006Maines T.R. Chen L.M. Matsuoka Y. Chen H. Rowe T. Ortin J. Falcon A. Nguyen T.H. Mai le Q. Sedyaningsih E.R. et al.Lack of transmission of H5N1 avian-human reassortant influenza viruses in a ferret model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12121-12126Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), suggesting that H5N1 transmission involves multiple genetic adaptations. Factors beyond the viral genome may also contribute to transmissibility. For example, virus is thought to be transmitted in droplets generated by coughing or sneezing. In a guinea pig model of human infection, H3N2 influenza virus was indeed transmitted via an aerosol, and aerosol transmission was enhanced by lower humidity and temperature (Lowen et al., 2007Lowen A.C. Mubareka S. Steel J. Palese P. Influenza virus transmission is dependent on relative humidity and temperature.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e151https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.0030151Crossref Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). These findings shed light on the seasonality of human influenza outbreaks. Importantly, however, H3N2 influenza virus is transmitted among guinea pigs without coughing and sneezing, which is not true in ferrets. If H5N1 viruses do acquire efficient human-to-human transmissibility, it will be important to understand the full range of factors that can modulate transmission. The coinfection of a human by a seasonal H3N2 influenza virus with efficient transmissibility and an avian H5N1 virus with poor transmissibility has the potential to generate a reassortant H5N1 virus with efficient transmission or pandemic potential. In a hallmark study, the reassortant viruses generated from swapping the genes of H5N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses did not yield influenza viruses with efficient transmissibility in ferrets (Maines et al., 2006Maines T.R. Chen L.M. Matsuoka Y. Chen H. Rowe T. Ortin J. Falcon A. Nguyen T.H. Mai le Q. Sedyaningsih E.R. et al.Lack of transmission of H5N1 avian-human reassortant influenza viruses in a ferret model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12121-12126Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is still concern about coinfection of humans and the emergence of H5N1 viruses with efficient human-to-human transmission. Multiple different genotypes of avian H5N1 viruses continue to emerge and the possibility of coinfection of humans with both avian H5N1 and seasonal H1N1 or H3N2 influenza virus is a continuing possibility. The possibility of genetic reassortment between these influenza viruses resulting in an H5N1 virus with increased ability to transmit between humans indicates that increased surveillance is needed to capture these coinfections of H5N1 and other influenza viruses and to elucidate which genetic reassortments will result in an influenza virus with pandemic potential. The contribution to pathogenesis of coinfections with influenza virus and bacteria is another intriguing research area. Evidence suggests that a majority of deaths during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia (McCullers, 2006McCullers J.A. Insights into the interaction between influenza virus and pneumococcus.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 19: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, Morens et al., 2008Morens D.M. Taubenberger J.K. Fauci A.S. Predominant role of bacterial pneumonia as a cause of death in pandemic influenza: implications for pandemic influenza preparedness.J. Infect. Dis. 2008; 198: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Major knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the complex interactions of multiple pathogens with each other and with the coinfected host. Thus, research and pandemic preparedness will require a focus on secondary bacterial infection and treatment. The pathology induced by some strains of influenza A virus has been correlated with an excessive immune response (de Jong et al., 2006de Jong M.D. Simmons C.P. Thanh T.T. Hien V.M. Smith G.J. Chau T.N. Hoang D.M. Chau N.V. Khanh T.H. Dong V.C. et al.Fatal outcome of human influenza A (H5N1) is associated with high viral load and hypercytokinemia.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Studies of innate immune cells (dendritic cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, and neutrophils) and of the CD4, CD8, and B lymphocytes during infection with H5N1 avian influenza virus are necessary to understand the protective and pathologic effects of the adaptive immune response and to inform the design of vaccines. The fundamental questions are the tissues in which these immune cells act, the effector functions they perform, and the requirements and mechanisms that regulate these functions. The rapid accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines (“cytokine storm”) after infection, with either the currently circulating highly pathogenic avian influenza virus or the 1918 Spanish influenza virus, is thought to play a prominent role in morbidity and mortality (Cheung et al., 2002Cheung C.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2053894178,"The RNA helicase eIF4A plays a key role in unwinding of mRNA and scanning during translation initiation. Free eIF4A is a poor helicase and requires the accessory proteins eIF4G and eIF4H. However, the structure of the helicase complex and the mechanisms of stimulation of eIF4A activity have remained elusive. Here we report the topology of the eIF4A/4G/4H helicase complex, which is built from multiple experimentally observed domain-domain contacts. Remarkably, some of the interactions are continuously rearranged during the ATP binding/hydrolysis cycle of the helicase. We show that the accessory proteins modulate the affinity of eIF4A for ATP by interacting simultaneously with both helicase domains and promoting either the closed, ATP-bound conformation or the open, nucleotide-free conformation. The topology of the complex and the spatial arrangement of the RNA-binding surfaces offer insights into their roles in stimulation of helicase activity and the mechanisms of mRNA unwinding and scanning."
https://openalex.org/W2013875083,"p53 and Akt are critical players regulating tumorigenesis with opposite effects: whereas p53 transactivates target genes to exert its function as a tumor suppressor, Akt phosphorylates its substrates and transduces downstream survival signals. In addition, p53 and Akt negatively regulate each other to balance survival and death signals within a cell. We now identify PHLDA3 as a p53 target gene that encodes a PH domain-only protein. We find that PHLDA3 competes with the PH domain of Akt for binding of membrane lipids, thereby inhibiting Akt translocation to the cellular membrane and activation. Ablation of endogenous PHLDA3 results in enhanced Akt activity and decrease of p53-dependent apoptosis. We also demonstrate the suppression of anchorage-independent cell growth by PHLDA3. Loss of the PHLDA3 genomic locus was frequently observed in primary lung cancers, suggesting a role of PHLDA3 in tumor suppression. Our results reveal a new mode of coordination between the p53 and Akt pathways. p53 and Akt are critical players regulating tumorigenesis with opposite effects: whereas p53 transactivates target genes to exert its function as a tumor suppressor, Akt phosphorylates its substrates and transduces downstream survival signals.

Our results reveal a new mode of coordination between the p53 and Akt pathways. Proper regulation of cell death, survival, and proliferation is fundamental to ensuring homeostasis of a multicellular organism. Complex signal transduction pathways controlled by oncoproteins and tumor suppressor proteins enable an elaborate balance of growth-promoting and growth-suppressing signals within a cell. One example of such a pathway is mutual regulatory crosstalk between tumor suppressor protein p53 and oncoprotein Akt, two key molecules regulating the life and death of a cell (Cully et al., 2006Cully M. You H. Levine A.J. Mak T.W. Beyond PTEN mutations: the PI3K pathway as an integrator of multiple inputs during tumorigenesis.Nat. Rev.

Prives C. p53 and prognosis: new insights and further complexity.Cell. 2005; 120: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The Akt signaling pathway plays a central role in cell survival and proliferation. Several components of this pathway are dysregulated in a wide spectrum of human cancers (i.e., Akt, PI3K, and PTEN), establishing its importance in oncogenesis (Luo et al., 2003Luo J. Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Targeting the PI3K-Akt pathway in human cancer: rationale and promise.Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Mitogenic signals by receptor tyrosine kinases are first transmitted to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to production of a second messenger, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 generation on the inner side of the plasma membrane leads to translocation and activation of Akt. Akt activation is regulated by a dual mechanism that requires both translocation to the plasma membrane and phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473. Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane through direct interaction with its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, functioning as lipid-binding modules. Downstream of Akt, Akt substrates contribute to the effects of Akt in cell survival and proliferation (Manning and Cantley, 2007Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. AKT/PKB signaling: navigating downstream.Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4275) Google Scholar). In contrast, p53 plays a major role in the induction of growth arrest and cell death (Harris and Levine, 2005Harris S.L. Levine A.J. The p53 pathway: positive and negative feedback loops.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, Liu and Chen, 2006Liu G. Chen X.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22627-22630Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As the inactivation of p53 abrogates p53-mediated growth constraints, loss of functional p53 is a prerequisite for oncogenesis and is the most common anomaly in human cancers (Vogelstein et al., 2000Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Surfing the p53 network.Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5530) Google Scholar, Vousden and Prives, 2005Vousden K.H. Prives C. p53 and prognosis: new insights and further complexity.Cell. 2005; 120: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Various stress signals stabilize and activate p53, which exerts its tumor-suppressive function mainly as a transcriptional activator. Many p53 target genes have been identified that regulate various processes involved in the prevention of tumorigenesis, such as the induction of cell-cycle arrest, cell death, DNA repair, and senescence. It has been postulated that target genes are selectively activated to implement different p53-mediated responses, depending on the stress signal that activates p53. Posttranslational modification of p53 is the candidate mechanism that makes p53 respond to different stress signals, and phosphorylation of p53 is a major posttranslational modification of p53 (Bode and Dong, 2004Bode A.M. Dong Z. Post-translational modification of p53 in tumorigenesis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies have shown the importance of p53 phosphorylation in the induction of several p53 target genes. Akt-p53 mutual regulation involves Akt substrates and p53 target genes; for example, one target gene of p53, PTEN, negatively regulates Akt (Mayo and Donner, 2002Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. The PTEN, Mdm2, p53 tumor suppressor-oncoprotein network.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 462-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). PTEN encodes a phosphatase that dephosphorylates lipid PIP3, which is essential for Akt activation. On the other hand, p53 is also negatively regulated by Akt. Akt phosphorylates Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53 that targets p53 for degradation, and Mdm2 phosphorylation leads to accelerated degradation of p53. Moreover, the mdm2 gene is transcriptionally regulated by p53, forming a p53-Mdm2 autoregulatory feedback loop (Brooks and Gu, 2006Brooks C.L. Gu W. p53 ubiquitination: Mdm2 and beyond.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Thus, Akt and p53 negatively regulate each other by a complex protein network to ensure coordinated growth control within a cell. As is evident from the findings of PTEN and Mdm2, identification of p53 target genes led to the discovery of tumor-associated genes. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in breast cancers and gliomas, while mdm2 is an oncogene frequently amplified in tumors without p53 mutations (Mayo and Donner, 2002Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. The PTEN, Mdm2, p53 tumor suppressor-oncoprotein network.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 462-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In order to identify genes participating in the regulation of tumorigenesis, and to dissect the functional relevance of p53 phosphorylation in target gene induction, we performed exhaustive analysis to identify p53 target genes that are induced in a manner dependent on p53 phosphorylation status (Ohki et al., 2007Ohki R. Kawase T. Ohta T. Ichikawa H. Taya Y. Dissecting functional roles of p53 N-terminal transactivation domains by microarray expression analysis.Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Kawase et al., 2008Kawase T. Ichikawa H. Ohta T. Nozaki N. Tashiro F. Ohki R. Taya Y. p53 target gene AEN is an exonuclease required for p53-dependent apoptosis.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 3797-3810Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We found that approximately 80% of genes depended on p53 phosphorylation, showing its importance in transcriptional activity of p53. Adding to the list of previously identified genes, we report here a p53 target gene, PHLDA3, that encodes a PH domain-only protein that suppresses Akt activity by directly interfering with Akt binding to membrane lipids. PHLDA3 also inhibits anchorage-independent growth and is a candidate tumor suppressor of lung endocrine tumors. Previously, we identified by microarray expression analysis genes induced by wild-type (WT) p53 and TAD-S/A, a phosphorylation-defective p53 mutant carrying point mutations at all Ser residues within the transactivation domain (TAD) (Ohki et al., 2007Ohki R. Kawase T. Ohta T. Ichikawa H. Taya Y. Dissecting functional roles of p53 N-terminal transactivation domains by microarray expression analysis.Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 1A and S1A (available online), PHLDA3 was one of the identified genes induced by WT p53 but not by TAD-S/A. PHLDA3 transcript was also induced by exogenous expression of p53, adriamycin treatment in cells carrying WT p53, γ-ray irradiation, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in a p53-dependent manner (Figures S1B, S1C, and 1B–1D). We also showed that the induction kinetics of PHLDA3 mRNA was similar to that of representative target genes of p53 (Figure S1D). In addition, PHLDA3 protein expression was induced by exogenous expression of p53 and various DNA-damaging agents, including 5-FU, ultraviolet (UV), and γ-ray irradiation, in cell lines carrying WT p53 (Figures 1E–1G and S2A–S2E). Furthermore, PHLDA3 and p21 proteins were induced with similar kinetics by UV and γ-ray irradiation (Figures 1G and S2E). It has been reported previously that the PHLDA3 (also named Tih1) gene has sequence similarity to an imprinted gene, Ipl (Frank et al., 1999Frank D. Mendelsohn C.L. Ciccone E. Svensson K. Ohlsson R. Tycko B. A novel pleckstrin homology-related gene family defined by Ipl/Tssc3, TDAG51, and Tih1: tissue-specific expression, chromosomal location, and parental imprinting.Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1150-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure S3, Ipl transcript was not induced with a dependence on p53, and although PHLDA3 and Ipl genes share sequence homology, they are regulated in different ways. As it had been demonstrated that PHLDA3 is a p53-responsive gene, we then explored whether PHLDA3 is also a direct target gene of p53. The consensus binding motif of p53 is composed of two copies of 5′-RRRCWWGYYY-3′ (R: purine, Y: pyrimidine, W: A or T) (Harris and Levine, 2005Harris S.L. Levine A.J. The p53 pathway: positive and negative feedback loops.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2A, we found a putative p53-responsive element (p53RE) upstream of the PHLDA3 gene, overlapping the transcription initiation site. Interestingly, this putative p53RE was highly conserved among the species. In order to clarify if this putative p53RE is activated by p53, the upstream region of the PHLDA3 gene was cloned and assayed for p53 responsiveness. We first analyzed whether promoters with or without p53RE showed p53 responsiveness by luciferase reporter promoter assay. As shown in Figure 2B, p53 responsiveness strictly depended on intact p53RE. Furthermore, double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing p53RE inserted upstream of the luciferase gene conferred strong p53 response on the promoter, which was abolished when p53RE was mutated (Figure 2C). On the other hand, the p53 mutant, V143A, which has no transactivation ability, did not activate the promoters, confirming that PHLDA3 promoter activation depends on p53 transcriptional activity (Figures 2B and 2C). We next analyzed whether p53 protein binds to the PHLDA3 promoter in vivo. As shown in Figure 2D, binding of WT p53 and TAD-S/A to the PHLDA3 promoter was analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, and it was strengthened when both p53s were active. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyzed p53 binding near the PHLDA3 gene, utilizing ChIP-chip and ChIP sequence technology. As shown in Figures 2E and S4A, strong and specific binding of endogenous p53 at p53RE was detected upon DNA damage. The signal obtained by ChIP-chip analysis was proportional to the strength of p53 binding, and the signal obtained for the PHLDA3 gene was as strong as other representative p53 target genes (Figure S4B). In addition, quantitative PCR was performed to analyze p53RE enrichment by ChIP. The relative enrichment of PHLDA3 p53RE after ChIP was compared to a locus with no p53 binding and was concentrated more than 50-fold (Figure S4C). Moreover, ChIP sequence assay was performed for histone H3 trimethylated at Lys 4 (trimethyl K4/H3). It has been reported that trimethyl K4/H3 peaks in the 5′ transcribed region and active genes can be discriminated from inactive genes by high levels of trimethyl K4/H3 (Schneider et al., 2004Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Histone H3 lysine 4 methylation patterns in higher eukaryotic genes.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Upon DNA damage, the PHLDA3 gene was actively transcribed and increased trimethyl K4/H3 was detected in the 5′ transcribed region simultaneously (Figures S1D and 2E). We finally analyzed, by p53 pull-down assay using biotinylated DNA probes containing one or two copies of p53RE, whether p53 binds directly to p53RE. As shown in Figure 2F, p53 was pulled down by WT but not by mutant p53RE. Collectively, these results identify PHLDA3 as a bona fide target gene of p53 and p53RE as the p53-responsive element of the PHLDA3 gene. Multiple phosphorylation occurs within the TAD of p53 and regulates p53 transcriptional activity (Bode and Dong, 2004Bode A.M. Dong Z. Post-translational modification of p53 in tumorigenesis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 1A and 2G, we found that PHLDA3 expression and promoter activation was severely diminished in cells expressing TAD-S/A. We therefore analyzed which Ser residue within the TAD contributes to PHLDA3 expression. We constructed p53 phosphorylation-deficient mutants carrying single amino acid conversions from Ser to Ala on all Ser residues within the TAD. As shown in Figure 2G, while p53 Ala mutants at Ser6, 9, 20, 33, and 37 showed activity similar to WT p53, the mutant at Ser15 showed decreased activity, similar to TAD-S/A. In addition, phosphorylation-mimic mutant S15D showed enhanced promoter response (Figure 2G, right panel). The requirements for Ser15 phosphorylation were also confirmed by analyzing endogenous PHLDA3 transcriptional activation by WT p53, TAD-S/A, S15A, S15D, or S46A (Figure 2H) and by mutants carrying combined (S15, 20A and S6, 33, 46A) amino acid conversions (Figure S5A). On the other hand, although weak impairment of PHLDA3 promoter activation was observed for S46A (Figure 2G left panel), it was not observed for endogenous PHLDA3 induction (Figures 2H and S5A). Phosphorylation of Ser15 upon genotoxic stress is dependent on ATM (Bode and Dong, 2004Bode A.M. Dong Z. Post-translational modification of p53 in tumorigenesis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Upon γ-ray irradiation, efficient Ser15 phosphorylation and PHLDA3 expression were detected, whereas both were diminished in the same cells treated with caffeine, an ATM inhibitor (Figure 2I). Furthermore, when cells were treated with siRNA targeting ATM, Ser15 phosphorylation and PHLDA3 expression reduced simultaneously upon γ-ray irradiation (Figure 2J). We also analyzed PHLDA3 expression in ATM-proficient normal human fibroblast WI-38 and ATM-deficient AT2KY fibroblasts and showed that ATM is required for both Ser15 phosphorylation and PHLDA3 expression (Figures S5B and S5C). These results collectively support the idea that p53 activation upon DNA damage is regulated by Ser15 phosphorylation, and PHLDA3 expression is dependent on it. ChIP analysis results showed that TAD-S/A can bind to the PHLDA3 promoter as efficiently as WT p53 (Figure 2D); however, TAD-S/A is unable to fully activate the PHLDA3 promoter. The phosphorylation status of p53 may not affect p53 binding to the PHLDA3 promoter but may affect other aspects of PHLDA3 promoter activation, such as cofactor recruitment to the promoters, leading to its efficient activation. To explore the physiological functions of PHLDA3, we first transduced PHLDA3 by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and analyzed the effect of ectopic PHLDA3 expression. As shown in Figures S6A and S9B, PHLDA3 induced cell death in several cell lines irrespective of the p53 status, consistent with PHLDA3 as a downstream mediator of p53. We found that cells with sub-G1 DNA content were increased by PHLDA3 expression (Figure S6A), and this increase was inhibited by z-VAD-fmk addition, a specific caspase inhibitor, showing that PHLDA3-induced cell death is caspase dependent (Figure 3A). In addition, caspase 3 activation and increased annexin V-positive/PI-negative cells were observed upon PHLDA3 expression (Figures 3B and S6B). We also compared the cell death-inducing ability of PHLDA3 with that of p53 and Noxa, a representative p53 target gene that induces apoptosis (Figure S6C). Although cell-death induction was weaker than that with p53, PHLDA3 induced cell death similarly to Noxa. Besides, we showed that endogenous PHLDA3 is required for p53-dependent apoptosis (Figure 5, discussed in detail later). Collectively, it was shown that PHLDA3 expression leads to apoptosis induction. PHLDA3 protein is highly conserved in vertebrates and is a small protein of 127 aa mostly comprised of the PH domain (Figure S7). Based on the results of the in vitro phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) binding assay, the PH domain of PHLDA3 is functional and binds to most PIP (Figure 3C and Saxena et al., 2002Saxena A. Morozov P. Frank D. Musalo R. Lemmon M.A. Skolnik E.Y. Tycko B. Phosphoinositide binding by the pleckstrin homology domains of Ipl and Tih1.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49935-49944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PHLDA3 binding to PIP occurs without stimulation and therefore PHLDA3 is localized to the cellular membrane when expressed (Figure S8). Accordingly, we tested whether PHLDA3's ability to induce apoptosis is dependent on the function of its PH domain. We fused WT PHLDA3 (WT PHLDA3) and mtPHLDA3, a PHLDA3 mutant with a small deletion within the PH domain (Figure S7), with GFP or DsRed, and subcellular localization was analyzed. As shown in Figures 4C and 4D, while DsRed-WT PHLDA3 localized to the plasma membrane as expected, DsRed-mtPHLDA3 localized mainly in the cytoplasm, showing that the PH domain of mtPHLDA3 is nonfunctional (equivalent GFP fusion proteins showed the same subcellular localizations, Figure 3F and data not shown). We next expressed GFP, GFP-WT PHLDA3, and GFP-mtPHLDA3 in 293T cells and analyzed GFP-positive cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 3D, compared to GFP-expressing cells, an increase of dead cells was observed in cells expressing GFP-WT PHLDA3, while no increase was observed for cells expressing GFP-mtPHLDA3. These results demonstrate that the functional PH domain is required for PHLDA3-induced apoptosis. The PH domain is an approximately 100-residue protein module found in many signaling proteins and binds to PIP located on the inner plasma membrane. The PH domain mediates protein recruitment to cellular membranes, which is of paramount importance for signal transduction (Lemmon and Ferguson, 2000Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Signal-dependent membrane targeting by pleckstrin homology (PH) domains.Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Given that apoptosis induction of PHLDA3 requires its PH domain, and PHLDA3 has no distinct functional domain other than the PH domain, we speculated that the physiological role of PHLDA3 is to function as a PH domain-only protein. We hypothesized that PHLDA3 is induced by p53 under stressed conditions, functioning as a dominant-negative molecule for other PH domain-containing proteins to shut off the signal transduction pathway mediated by those proteins. In order to test our hypothesis, we tested whether PH domains derived from other PH domain-containing proteins function similarly to PHLDA3 within the cell. We selected two well-known PH domain-containing proteins with distinct functions within the cell: serine/threonine kinase Akt, the main molecule that transduces survival signaling, and Grp1, a member of the GTP-binding protein exchange factor family that regulates cell adhesion and spreading (Lemmon and Ferguson, 2000Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Signal-dependent membrane targeting by pleckstrin homology (PH) domains.Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). It has been reported that both PH domains of Akt and Grp1 bind to PIP3, and when isolated PH domains are expressed in cells, they function as dominant-negative forms of the proteins (Songyang et al., 1997Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T.F. Interleukin 3-dependent survival by the Akt protein kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, Varnai et al., 2005Varnai P. Bondeva T. Tamas P. Toth B. Buday L. Hunyady L. Balla T. Selective cellular effects of overexpressed pleckstrin-homology domains that recognize PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 suggest their interaction with protein binding partners.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4879-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The PH domain of Akt or Grp1 was fused with GFP (GFP-PH-Akt, GFP-PH-Grp1) and expressed in 293T and COS7 cells. As expected, GFP-PH-Akt repressed Akt activity and induced apoptosis by inhibition of the Akt pathway (Figures 3D and 3E), whereas GFP-PH-Grp1 inhibited cell spreading on fibronectin and cell attachment to culture dishes by inhibiting endogenous Grp1 signaling (Figures 3F and 3G). GFP-PH-Akt had no effect on cell spreading and a very weak effect on cell attachment (Figures 3F and 3G), and GFP-PH-Grp1 had a very weak effect on cell survival and no effect on Akt activity (Figures 3D and 3E), showing the selective effect of these PH domains, as reported (Varnai et al., 2005Varnai P. Bondeva T. Tamas P. Toth B. Buday L. Hunyady L. Balla T. Selective cellular effects of overexpressed pleckstrin-homology domains that recognize PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 suggest their interaction with protein binding partners.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4879-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We found that GFP-WT PHLDA3 induced apoptosis and repressed Akt activity as GFP-PH-Akt, whereas it had a very weak effect on cell spreading and attachment, showing that PHLDA3 functions similarly to the PH domain of Akt (Figures 3D–3G). PHLDA3 represses Akt activity and induces apoptosis, suggesting that it functions as a PH domain-only protein to inhibit Akt; therefore, we further examined whether PHLDA3 induces apoptosis by inhibiting Akt activation. As shown in Figure 4A, PHLDA3 expression resulted in diminished Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308, both of which are essential for Akt activity, whereas the phosphorylation status of Erk was not changed by PHLDA3 expression, showing that inhibition of Akt activity is not a result of inhibition of the global cell survival signaling pathway. We also compared sensitivity to apoptosis induction by LY294002, a specific PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibitor, and apoptosis by PHLDA3 expression within several cell lines (Figures S9A and S9B). Cell lines sensitive to LY294002 treatment were also sensitive to PHLDA3 expression. Furthermore, when MM468 cells were treated with LY294002, PHLDA3 expression did not enhance apoptosis, indicating that PHLDA3 expression does not increase PI3K pathway inhibition in apoptosis induction (Figure S9C). These results collectively suggest that apoptosis induction by PHLDA3 is mediated by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway. We next tested whether the expression of constitutively active forms of Akt restrains apoptosis induced by PHLDA3. We selected two constitutively active forms of Akt, neither of which require PIP3 binding for activation: a double mutant mimicking phosphorylated Akt (T308D/S473D-Akt) and myristoylated and PH domain-deleted constitutively active Akt (myr-Akt). We first transfected 293T cells with GFP-PHLDA3 and T308D/S473D-Akt. As shown in Figure S10A, by cotransfection of T308D/S473D-Akt, PHLDA3-induced apoptosis was rescued, and this rescue was dependent on T308D/S473D-Akt dosage. When the effect of T308D/S473D-Akt on apoptosis induced by PHLDA3 and PH-Akt was compared, T308D/S473D-Akt similarly rescued both (Figure S10B). We next obtained cells stably expressing myr-Akt and analyzed apoptosis induction by ectopic PHLDA3 expression. As shown in Figure 4B, compared to control cells, apoptotic cells decreased and viable cells increased in myr-Akt-expressing cells, showing that myr-Akt efficiently repressed apoptosis induced by PHLDA3. Thus, these results reveal that PHLDA3 inhibits Akt activation, and Akt inhibition mainly contributes to apoptosis induction by PHLDA3. Activation and phosphorylation of Akt require prior PIP binding at the plasma membrane (Stokoe et al., 1997Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Dual role of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in the activation of protein kinase B.Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). When PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 are generated by PI3K upon growth stimulation, Akt translocates from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane by binding to PIP through its PH domain, which specifically binds to PI(3,4,5)P3 or PI(3,4)P2 (Figure 3C and Scheid and Woodgett, 2003Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Unravelling the activation mechanisms of protein kinase B/Akt.FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 108-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Since two constitutively active forms of Akt that do not require PIP binding for activation rescued PHLDA3-induced apoptosis, it was suggested that PHLDA3 inhibits Akt binding to PIP. We therefore analyzed whether PHLDA3 expression inhibits Akt translocation to the plasma membrane upon PIP3 production. We coexpressed DsRed or DsRed-WT PHLDA3 together with GFP-PH-Akt in NIH 3T3 cells (Figures 4C and S11A). GFP-PH-Akt has been shown to mimic Akt translocation upon PI3K pathway activation (Harriague and Bismuth, 2002Harriague J. Bismuth G. Imaging antigen-induced PI3K activation in T cells.Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1090-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As has been reported, PDGF treatment of control cells expressing DsRed resulted in GFP-PH-Akt translocation to the plasma membrane, whereas in cells expressing DsRed-WT PHLDA3, GFP-PH-Akt translocation was inhibited. Moreover, inhibition was not observed in cells expressing DsRed-mtPHLDA3, a PHLDA3 mutant with a defective PH domain, which cannot localize at the plasma membrane. To assess the effect of PHLDA3 expression on Akt localization in other cell lines, a similar experiment was performed using 293T cells with constitutively active PI3K activity. Again in 293T cells, DsRed-WT PHLDA3 interfered with GFP-PH-Akt localization to the plasma membrane, while DsRed or DsRed-mtPHLDA3 did not (Figures 4D and S11B). Taken together, the results show that PHLDA3 impedes Akt translocation to the cellular membrane and subsequent activation in a manner dependent on its PH domain function. Because PHLDA3 expression led to the inhibition of Akt translocation to the plasma membrane and subsequent phosphorylation and activation, we next analyzed the mechanism by which PHLDA3 inactivates Akt. We first tested whether PHLDA3 inhibits Akt activity by affecting upstream signals of Akt. Since PI3K-produced PIP3 is essential for Akt activation, we analyzed the amount of PIP3 in cells expressing PHLDA3 using the PIP3 mass strip kit. Acidic lipids were extracted from MM468 cells infected with Ad-LacZ and Ad-PHLDA3 and blotted onto a PIP3 strip. PIP3 was quantified by detecting membrane-blotted acidic lipids with a PIP3 detector. As shown in Figure 4E, no difference in the amount of PIP3 was detected between control and PHLDA3-expressing cells, while significantly reduced PIP3 was detected in MM468 cells treated with LY294002. As PHLDA3 did not affect Akt upstream signals, we next tested whe"
https://openalex.org/W1978309689,"Dynein ATPases power diverse microtubule-based motilities. Each dynein motor domain comprises a ring-like head containing six AAA+ modules and N- and C-terminal regions, together with a stalk that binds microtubules. How these subdomains are arranged and generate force remains poorly understood. Here, using electron microscopy and image processing of tagged and truncated Dictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein constructs, we show that the heart of the motor is a hexameric ring of AAA+ modules, with the stalk emerging opposite the primary ATPase site (AAA1). The C-terminal region is not an integral part of the ring but spans between AAA6 and near the stalk base. The N-terminal region includes a lever-like linker whose N terminus swings by approximately 17 nm during the ATPase cycle between AAA2 and the stalk base. Together with evidence of stalk tilting, which may communicate changes in microtubule binding affinity, these findings suggest a model for dynein's structure and mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2047426956,"Zinc is an essential biological trace element. It is required for the structure or function of over 300 proteins, and it is increasingly recognized for its role in cell signaling. However, high concentrations of zinc have cytotoxic effects, and overexposure to zinc can cause pain and inflammation through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that zinc excites nociceptive somatosensory neurons and causes nociception in mice through TRPA1, a cation channel previously shown to mediate the pungency of wasabi and cinnamon through cysteine modification. Zinc activates TRPA1 through a unique mechanism that requires zinc influx through TRPA1 channels and subsequent activation via specific intracellular cysteine and histidine residues. TRPA1 is highly sensitive to intracellular zinc, as low nanomolar concentrations activate TRPA1 and modulate its sensitivity. These findings identify TRPA1 as an important target for the sensory effects of zinc and support an emerging role for zinc as a signaling molecule that can modulate sensory transmission."

An understanding of their structure and mechanisms of action is necessary to the development of strategies for their regulation.

These families are reviewed from a structural point of view. Cleavage of peptide bonds is essential for life, and the factors responsible for peptide cleavage are ubiquitous. Among them are MPs, 2The abbreviations used are: MPmetallopeptidaseMMPmatrix metalloproteinaseNSDN-terminal subdomainCSDC-terminal subdomain. which are mostly zinc-dependent peptide-bond hydrolases. They participate in metabolism through both extensive and unspecific protein degradation and controlled hydrolysis of specific peptide bonds (1.Neurath H. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 73: 3825-3832Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Deregulation of such vast degrading potential leads to pathologies, and in addition, MPs may also act as virulence factors during poisoning and microbial infection. Such a wide range of biological functions makes structural studies of these proteins indispensable to any understanding of their function and to the design of novel, highly specific therapeutic agents to modulate their activity (2.López-Otín C.

Most MPs are members of a protease tribe, the zincins, and they possess a short consensus amino acid sequence, HEXXH. This motif contains two protein ligands of the catalytic zinc and a glutamate that acts as general base/acid during the catalytic process (3.Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöcker W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 4.Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). A third metal ligand is a solvent molecule, further bound to and polarized by the glutamate. This solvent performs nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond of a bound substrate, leading to a tetrahedral gem-diolate reaction intermediate, which is stabilized by the positively charged metal ion and neighboring protein residues (5.Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Subsequent evolution of the intermediate under assistance of the general base/acid eventually leads to bond disruption. Zincins are divided into the gluzincin, aspzincin, and metzincin clans (4.Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 7.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Mol.

The latter contains mostly multidomain proteins with an N-terminal prodomain engaged in latency maintenance, a catalytic protease domain, and farther downstream domains engaged in protein-protein and cell-cell interactions and other regulatory functions. The protease domain is characterized by a C-terminally extended zinc-binding motif, HEXXHXXGXX(H/D), with a hallmark glycine and a third zinc-binding histidine or aspartate. In addition, a methionine is present in a conserved downstream turn, the Met-turn (3.Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Stöcker W.

Metzincins split into families, seven of which have been characterized at the structural level for at least one of their members: astacins, ADAMs/adamalysins/reprolysins, serralysins, matrix metalloproteinases, snapalysins, leishmanolysins, and pappalysins. In addition, a series of sequences reported from genome sequencing projects indicate there are further structurally yet uncharacterized families, tentatively referred to as fragilysins, gametolysins, archaemetzincins, thuringilysins, coelilysins, ascomycolysins, helicolysins, and cholerilysins (for a detailed review, see Ref. 7.Gomis-Rüth F.X.

These prototypes cover distinct kingdoms of life and represent archaea, bacteria, protozoa, crustaceans, reptiles, and mammals. The structures reveal that metzincins share a common scaffold and active-site environment, but each family has distinguishing structural elements. Mature catalytic domains are ∼130–260-residue globular moieties that bifurcate into an upper NSD and a lower CSD with respect to a central active-site cleft. Substrates bind horizontally to this cleft from left to right in an approximately extended conformation (supplemental Fig. 1 A). (All topological indications refer to the standard orientation displayed in this figure.) The NSD displays a five-stranded twisted β-sheet at the top (except leishmanolysin, which has four strands) (supplemental Fig. 1A). All strands (βI–βV) except the fourth are parallel to each other and to any substrate that is bound in the cleft. The antiparallel strand, βIV, forms the lower edge of this subdomain and creates an upper rim or northern wall of the active-site crevice (16.Maskos K. Bode W. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 25: 241-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This strand binds a substrate in an antiparallel manner, mainly on its non-primed side. The loop segment connecting strands βIII and βIV (referred to as LβIIIβIV) leads to the appearance of bulge-like elements, which mainly affect subsites S1′ and S2′ (see Ref. 17.Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar for subsite nomenclature in proteases). This gives rise to extensive variations in enzyme-substrate interactions on the primed side of the active-site clefts. The NSD also contains two long α-helices, αA and αB, the backing helix and the active-site helix, respectively. Both are arranged on the concave side of the β-sheet in an identical manner in all metzincin structures (supplemental Fig. 1B). Helix αB superimposes well in all seven structures (Fig. 1A) and encompasses the first half of the zinc-binding motif, which includes the first two zinc-binding histidine residues (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1). At the end of helix αB, the polypeptide chain takes a sharp downward turn, mediated by the glycine of the consensus sequence. The main-chain angles of this residue in the different lead structures indicate that any other residue would be in a high-energy conformation and thus disfavored, with the exception of ulilysin (see below). The CSD starts after this glycine, and the chain leads to the third zinc ligand, a histidine or an aspartate, which approaches the metal from below (supplemental Fig. 1). This subdomain contains few repetitive secondary structure elements, mainly a C-terminal helix αC at the end of the polypeptide chain. Helices αB and αC are connected by structures that vary both in length and conformation. However, all structures coincide at a conserved 1,4-β-turn containing a methionine at position 3, the Met-turn, which is separated from the third zinc-binding histidine by connecting segments of 6–53 amino acids in the different structures. The Met-turn is superimposable (including the conformation of the methionine side chain) (Fig. 1A) and is positioned underneath the catalytic Zn2+, forming a hydrophobic pillow. However, no direct contact with the metal is observed. Mutation studies suggested a role for this methionine in the folding and stability of the catalytic domains, although the strict conservation of this residue remains to be explained (18.Hege T. Baumann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19.Butler G.S. Tam E.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15615-15620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 3A. E. Oberholzer, M. Bumann, T. Hege, S. Russo, and U. Baumann, unpublished data. The S1′ pocket of metzincins is shaped at the top by a protruding bulge made by LβIIIβIV and at the bottom by a wall-forming segment made up of residues intercalated between the Met-turn and the C-terminal helix αC (16.Maskos K. Bode W. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 25: 241-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This segment diverges in structure and length (ranging from 11 to 37 residues between the Met-turn methionine and the first residue of helix αC) in all seven of the reference structures. The catalytic zinc ion lies roughly at the center of the bottom of the active-site cleft. It is coordinated by the Nϵ2 atoms of the three consensus histidines (two histidine Nϵ2 atoms and one aspartate Oδ2 atom in snapalysin) and the catalytic solvent molecule, substituted by other ligands in the enzyme/inhibitor-product complexes reported (supplemental Table 1). Some metzincins display an additional protein ligand at a slightly greater distance from the catalytic cation in the form of a tyrosine Oη atom, as seen in unbound astacin and serralysins and as hypothesized in ulilysin (21.Tallant C. García-Castellanos R. Marrero A. Canals F. Yang Y. Reymond J.L. Solà M. Baumann U. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This tyrosine residue lies two positions ahead of the Met-turn methionine. In (unbound) snapalysin, a tyrosine lies two positions downstream of the metal-binding aspartate, though no longer within binding distance of the zinc ion. These tyrosine residues flip back and forth during substrate anchoring, cleavage, and product release in a motion referred to as the tyrosine switch. In this, they may play a role in substrate and catalytic solvent binding and stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate or the product amino group (7.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 9.Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W.

Such a role is performed by other, non-conserved residues in tyrosine-lacking metzincins. A structure-based sequence alignment reveals that, with the exception of the region comprising the zinc-binding consensus sequence, sequence identity is negligible among metzincins despite evident structural relatedness. Based on this alignment, pairwise comparisons between leads (supplemental Fig. 2) show between 41 and 118 topologically equivalent Cα positions and root mean square deviations between 3.3 and 4.0Å, i.e. above the threshold at which two Cα positions can be considered as structurally equivalent (3.0 Å) (25.Domingues F.S. Lackner P. Andreeva A. Sippl M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The sequence identities range between 3 and 20%, i.e. clearly below twilight values for sequence relatedness (25–35%) (26.Rost B. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). The closest structural pairs are aeruginolysin and MMP-8 (Z-score = 15.8) (supplemental Fig. 2 and supplemental Refs. 1.Neurath H. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 73: 3825-3832Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar and 2.López-Otín C. Overall C.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 3: 509-519Crossref Scopus (632) Google Scholar), MMP-8 and snapalysin (15.2), adamalysin II and ulilysin (14.4), and adamalysin II and leishmanolysin (14.3). The most distant pairs are astacin and adamalysin II (Z-score = 2.9), MMP-8 and ulilysin (6.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 43: 319-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar.2), and snapalysin and ulilysin (6.6). Astacin is a 200-residue digestive enzyme from the crayfish A. astacus and the first member of the astacin family to be structurally analyzed (9.Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Through protein degradation, growth factor activation, extracellular matrix turnover, and extracellular coat degradation (hatching), astacins participate in diverse biological processes such as digestion, development, and tissue remodeling and differentiation (e.g. promoting cartilage and bone formation and collagen biosynthesis) (27.Sterchi E.E. Stöcker W. Bond J.S. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of astacin shows a packman-like spherical shape and two subdomains of approximately equal size (supplemental Fig. 1A) (9.Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Whereas this proteinase contains only a propeptide and a catalytic MP domain, most other astacins display additional C-terminal MATH, MAM, CUB-like, Ser/Thr-rich, I (inserted)-, epidermal growth factor-like, Tox1, and transmembrane modules (for details, see Refs. 8.Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Rüth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 27.Sterchi E.E. Stöcker W. Bond J.S. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, and 28.Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The astacin family has the longest region of the CSD lacking regular secondary structure elements, just a small helix and a short β-ribbon, although this is the sequentially most conserved connecting segment among metzincins (see Table 1 in Ref. 7.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The protein scaffold is cross-linked by four conserved cysteine residues forming two disulfide bridges (supplemental Fig. 1). The first two residues of the mature enzyme are buried in an internal cavity in the CSD, and the N-terminal α-amino group establishes an interaction with a conserved glutamate next to the third zinc-binding histidine. The unbound coordination of the catalytic zinc is trigonal-bipyramidal due to the presence of the fourth invariant, although somewhat more distal, tyrosine zinc ligand downstream of the Met-turn (supplemental Fig. 1A). In addition to astacin, the structures of human tolloid-like protease-1 and bone morphogenetic protein-1 have recently been reported (29.MacSweeney A. Gil-Parrado S. Vinzenz D. Bernardi A. Hein A. Bodendorf U. Erbel P. Logel C. Gerhartz B. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 387: 228-239Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Serralysins are ∼50-kDa bacterial virulence factors secreted as autoactivatable zymogens by pathogenic γ-class proteobacteria (30.Baumann U. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes.in: Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner Jr., J.F. 2nd Ed. Vol. 1. Elsevier/Academic Press, London2004: 579-581Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These organisms are responsible for human diseases such as meningitis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis, plague, dermatitis, soft tissue infections, septicemia, melioidosis, pneumonia, and other respiratory and urinary tract infections. They play a major role in hospital-acquired infections due to their capacity to produce surgical wound infections and to infect neonates. As part of the virulence potential of these bacteria, serralysins are directed against coagulation factors and defense-oriented proteins, protease inhibitors, lysozyme, and transferrin and may cause an anaphylactic response. The first serralysin to be biochemically and structurally characterized was P. aeruginosa aeruginolysin (10.Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Its mature 220-residue catalytic domain lacks disulfide connections and is flanked on its C-terminal end by a calcium-stabilized β-roll domain. As in astacin, its two subdomains are of similar size. The polypeptide chain starts with an α-helix in the CSD (characteristic for the family) that is anchored to the molecular body by a conserved salt bridge with the C-terminal helix αC (supplemental Fig. 1B). The NSD features a flap made up by an elongated LβIαA and runs across the convex surface of the β-sheet. This flap varies greatly among serralysins (20 reported structures) (supplemental Table 1), distinctly affecting substrate binding. The CSD of aeruginolysin presents an extra α-helix within the segment linking the Met-turn with the wall-forming stretch and a second flap shaped by residues of the connecting segment. These elements also modulate substrate binding. Comparison of aeruginolysin, which was first solved in complex with a bound tetrapeptide (10.Baumann U. Wu S. Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3357-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), with the closely related structure of unbound Serratia marcescens serralysin reveals that the unliganded zinc coordination is similar to astacin (trigonal-bipyramidal). It also includes a tyrosine that undergoes a hinge motion upon substrate binding (31.Baumann U. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). S. caespitosus snapalysin is a secreted neutral protease that comprises a 132-residue catalytic domain preceded by an alanine-rich 100-amino acid N-terminal extension including a signal peptide and a prodomain. Similar sequences have been reported for other Streptomyces species, and they have been termed SnpA (Prt and snapalysin), MprA, and SnpA. They show milk-hydrolyzing activity. Snapalysin is the smallest metzincin and the only family member that has been structurally characterized. Its structure recalls a flattened ellipsoid and bifurcates into two asymmetric subdomains (12.Kurisu G. Kinoshita T. Sugimoto A. Nagara A. Kai Y. Kasai N. Harada S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It displays all the characteristic metzincin features, connected by short loops. Distinguishing elements are a small LβIIβIII protruding from the upper sheet within the NSD, a small bulge on top of the primed side of the active-site crevice, a short helix in LβVαB, and a calcium-binding site (supplemental Fig. 1A). In addition, an aspartate is found at the position of the third zinc-binding histidine, and two positions ahead in the sequence, a conserved tyrosine approaches but not binds the metal. MMPs are secreted or membrane-bound proteinases discovered 47 years ago and participate in tail resorption during tadpole-to-frog metamorphosis. They are found mainly in higher mammals, although related sequences have been found in fish, amphibians, insects, plants, prokaryotes, and viruses. Through turnover of extracellular matrix proteins, MMPs are involved in tissue resorption, remodeling, and repair, as observed during embryogenesis and development, branching and organ morphogenesis, and angiogenesis. However, their potent proteolytic potential or its absence may also lead to pathologies such as inflammation, ulcers, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, periodontitis, heart failure and cardiovascular disease, fibrosis, emphysema, and cancer and metastasis (32.Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). More recently, MMPs have been observed to be engaged in (in)activation events following limited proteolysis, as observed in apoptosis and intestinal defense protein activation but also in pathologies including stroke, human immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia, atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, bacterial meningitis, and Alzheimer disease. MMPs include extracellular proteins such as other (pro)proteinases, inhibitors, clotting factors, antimicrobial peptides, and chemotactic and adhesion molecules. In common with ADAMs (see below), MMPs are also involved in ectodomain shedding of growth factors, growth factor-binding proteins, hormones and hormone receptors, and cytokines and cytokine receptors from the cell surface (33.McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Like other metzincin families, MMPs are mosaic proteins constituted by a series of inserts and domains. These may include an ∼20-residue secretory signal peptide, an ∼80-residue propeptide, a 160–170-residue zinc- and calcium-dependent catalytic proteinase domain, a linker region, and a 4-fold propeller hemopexin-like C-terminal domain. Further insertions may include fibronectin type II-related domains; a collagen type V-like and vitronectin-like insertion domain; a cysteine-rich, a proline-rich, and an interleukin-1 receptor-like domain; an immunoglobulin-like domain; a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage signal; a membrane anchor; and a cytoplasmic tail. Naming of MMPs started historically with fibroblast collagenase as MMP-1 and has currently reached MMP-28, with 23 different forms described in humans (34.Puente X.S. Sánchez L.M. Overall C.M. López-Otín C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Those MMPs encompassing a membrane anchor gave rise to the membrane-type MMP subfamily (16.Maskos K. Bode W. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 25: 241-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 32.Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Zymogen activation proceeds in MMPs according to a cysteine switch or Velcro mechanism. This removes the prodomain and switches from an inactive state, where the Sγ atom of a cysteine residue within a conserved motif, PRCGVPD, substitutes the catalytic solvent molecule in the zinc coordination sphere, to the fully accessible active enzyme (35.Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 36.Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). MMPs are the structurally most thoroughly studied metzincin family, with >120 structures reported (supplemental Table 1) (37.Tallant C. Marrero A. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta (Mol. Cell Res.). 2009; (in press)Google Scholar). The mature catalytic domain of human neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) (13.Bode W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Tschesche H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 37.Tallant C. Marrero A. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta (Mol. Cell Res.). 2009; (in press)Google Scholar) has a shallow active-site cavity, which separates a larger NSD (∼120 residues) from a smaller CSD (∼40 amino acids), and generally a deep hydrophobic S1′ pocket. No disulfide bonds are present in the structure. The N-terminal α-amino group is anchored to the first of two conserved aspartates imbedded in helix αC. The NSD displays an S-shaped double loop connecting strands βIII and βIV, which embraces a structural zinc cation and a tightly bound calcium ion. The downstream residues of this segment form a prominent bulge that protrudes into the active-site groove. LβIVβV and LβIIβIII contribute to a second calcium-binding site on top of the NSD β-sheet (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). In the CSD, the MMP-8 chain displays the shortest and most conserved connecting segment within metzincins. ADAMs/adamalysins/reprolysins split into three subgroups, the snake venom MPs, the mammalian ADAMs, and the likewise mammalian ADAMTSs (38.Cal S. Obaya A.J. Llamazares M. Garabaya C. Quesada V. López-Otín C. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 283: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 39.Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 40.Edwards D.R. Handsley M.M. Pennington C.J. Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29: 258-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 41.Takeda S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The former are responsible for post-envenomation hemorrhage through digestion of extracellular matrix components surrounding capillaries, resulting in tissue necrosis. In turn, ADAMs were originally described to play a role in fertilization and sperm function in mammalian reproductive tracts. They are involved in myogenesis, development, neurogenesis, differentiation of osteoblastic cells, cell migration modulation, and muscle fusion. They are also engaged in human disorders like asthma, cardiac hypertrophy, obesity-associated adipogenesis and cachexia, rheumatoid arthritis, endotoxic shock, inflammation, and Alzheimer disease. They also have a major role in protein ectodomain shedding as described previously for MMPs. Finally, some family members lacking the transmembrane domain and harboring multiple copies of a thrombospondin 1-like repeat and a CUB domain gave rise to a distinct subfamily of soluble extracellular proteases, the ADAMTSs (42.Nagase H. Fushimi K. Connect. Tissue Res. 2008; 49: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These enzymes disable cell adhesion by binding to integrins. They are also involved in gonad formation, embryonic development and angiogenesis, and procollagen activation, as well as in inflammatory processes, cartilage (aggrecan) degradation in arthritic diseases, bleeding disorders, and glioma tumor invasion. All ADAMs/adamalysins/reprolysins are extracellular multidomain proteins containing a catalytic zinc- and calcium-dependent MP domain. In addition, they can display a prodomain and C-terminal disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich, C-type lectin, epidermal growth factor-like, thrombospondin 1-like, and/or transmembrane domains, as well as a cytoplasmic domain. Latency is maintained by the prodomain, and activation is believed to occur as in MMPs, i.e. by cleavage of the prodomain according to a cysteine switch-like mechanism (7.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 36.Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 43.Grams F. Huber R. Kress L.F. Moroder L. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The first catalytic domain structure to be analyzed was that of adamalysin II from C. adamanteus snake venom (11.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Kress L.F. Bode W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4151-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This is a compact 203-residue molecule of oblate ellipsoidal shape, notched at the periphery to render a relatively flat substrate-fixing cleft. This cleft separates a large ∼150-residue NSD from a small ∼50-residue CSD (supplemental Fig. 1A). Both the N and C termini are surface-located; the former is linked by a salt bridge to the C-terminal helix αC (7.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Adamalysin II deviates most from the metzincin consensus sequence within the conserved regular secondary structure elements, especially at strand βI and helices αA and αC (Fig. 1B). Inserted into the common scaffold, two additional helices are found within the NSD. In the CSD, two disulfide bonds cross-link the irregular connecting segment and attach helix αC to the NSD, respectively. A calcium ion is located on the surface, opposite the active site and close to the C terminus (supplemental Fig. 1A). The S1′ pocket, characterized by a pronounced bulge segment LβIVβV, is hydrophobic and deep, reminiscent of some MMPs. In addition to adamalysin II, a number of snake venom MPs (ADAM-17, ADAM-33, and ADAMTS-1, -4, and -5) have been structurally analyzed to date (supplemental Table 1). Leishmanolysins are cell-surface proteins present in most trypanosomatid, plasmodiid, and sarcocystid protozoa. They constitute the major component of the promastigote surface and are enzymatically active against polypeptide substrates. They cleave CD4 molecules at the surface of human T cells and protect promastigotes from lysis by complement proteins, suggesting a possible role as a virulence factor. Related sequences have been found in mammals (here called invadolysin), fruit flies, thale cress, nematodes, and bacteria (7.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 44.McHugh B. Krause S.A. Yu B. Deans A.M. Heasman S. McLaughlin P. Heck M.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The only structurally analyzed family member is L. major leishmanolysin. It is synthesized as a 602-residue inactive precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum with a signal and a 100-residue propeptide, which includes a highly conserved cysteine residue potentially acting as a cysteine switch (see above). Activation liberates a mature MP of ∼280 residues, followed by an ∼200-residue C-terminal domain. A 63-residue insertion domain is observed between the glycine and the third zinc-binding histidine of the long consensus motif (supplemental Fig. 1A). The MP domain is the most asymmetric among metzincins, with a 175-residue NSD and just an ∼45-amino acid CSD. Its N terminus is located on the back left surface. The NSD is characterized by a β-sheet, which lacks strand βII (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B), and by the presence of two unique ∼40-amino acid inserted flaps, which account for most of the differences in size from the other proteins of the clan. The NSD is cross-linked by two disulfide bonds. Preceding strand βIV, a slightly prominent bulge segment lies on top of the shallow, medium-sized S1′ pocket, which is delimited by the wall-forming segment and the beginning of the active-site helix αB. At the end of the CSD, helix αC is followed by a segment in an extended conformation, which runs from left to right across the back surface (14.Schlagenhauf E. Etges R. Metcalf P. Structure (Camb.). 1998; 6: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The most recent family to be structurally characterized are the pappalysins. They were named after human PAPP-A, a heavily glycosylated 170-kDa multidomain protein specifically cleaving insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (45.Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T. Laursen L.S. Weyer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Proulilysin is a 38-kDa archaeal protein from M. acetivorans that shares sequence similarity with PAPP-A, but it encompasses only the prodomain and the catalytic domain (15.Tallant C. García-Castellanos R. Seco J. Baumann U. Gomis-Rüth F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17920-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The proprotein may undergo cysteine switch-mediated activation, as suggested by the presence of a conserved cysteine in the prodomain. Activation occurs autolytically in the presence of calcium. With 262 residues, mature ulilysin is the largest MP of all metzincin catalytic domains. As distinguishing features, it presents in the NSD a loop dividing strand βII into two substrands (βII and βII′) and a β-ribbon inserted within LβIIIβIV that protrudes from the molecular surface and frames the active site on its primed side. The segment connecting helix αA with strand βII is the largest among metzincins and covers almost all of the back of the molecule from the NSD to the CSD in a cape-like fashion and includes two unique α-helices. The glycine of the zinc-binding motif is replaced in ulilysin and a small subset of pappalysins by an asparagine under slight variation of the main-chain angles, which do not correspond here to a high-energy conformation but to a left-handed α-helix. Overall, the chain trace flanking this residue is indistinguishable from other metzincins (supplemental Fig. 1) (7.Gomis-Rüth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The CSD shows two disulfide bonds and a unique two-calcium site. This site is a molecular switch for activity, as the proteinase can be reversibly inhibited through calcium chelators (15.Tallant C. García-Castellanos R. Seco J. Baumann U. Gomis-Rüth F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17920-17928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20.García-Castellanos R. Tallant C. Marrero A. Solà M. Baumann U. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 2007; 388: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Finally, in the absence of an unbound structure, ulilysin may possess a fifth zinc-binding tyrosine ligand provided by the Met-turn that is swung out upon substrate binding. The metzincins constitute a clan of ubiquitous MPs present in all kingdoms of life, which are pivotal for physiology and pathology. So far, seven families have been structurally analyzed. The clan represents a case of divergent evolution from an urmetzincin, which may not look very different from the smallest member, snapalysin. Into such a minimal scaffold, evolution has introduced unique structural elements conserved among each family. Based on the presence of an extended zinc-binding consensus sequence pattern, several more families have been suggested to enlarge the clan, although future structural analysis will be required to confirm their ascription. Structural information on each of the seven families may help to elucidate common catalytic and processing mechanisms and to assign the function of proteins encoded by newly discovered gene sequences."

Further, these redundancies show surprising evolutionary stability over prolonged time scales. We propose that redundancies are not just archeological leftovers of ancient gene duplications, but rather that synergy arising from feedback between redundant copies may serve as an information processing element that facilitates signal transduction and the control of gene expression."

Because sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are the major transcriptional factors in lipogenic gene expression including fatty acid synthase (FAS), we examined the effects of HCV nonstructural proteins on the signaling pathways of SREBP. In this study, we demonstrated that HCV nonstructural 4B (NS4B) protein increased the transcriptional activities of SREBPs. We also showed that HCV NS4B enhanced the protein expression levels of SREBPs and FAS. This was further confirmed in the context of viral RNA replication and HCV infection. The up-regulation of both SREBP and FAS by NS4B protein required phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. We also demonstrated that NS4B protein induced a lipid accumulation in hepatoma cells. In addition, NS4B protein synergistically elevated the transcriptional activity of HCV core-mediated SREBP-1. These results strongly suggest that NS4B may play an important role in HCV-associated liver pathogenesis by modulating the SREBP signaling pathway."

Huntingtin undergoes proteolysis by calpains and caspases within an N-terminal region between amino acids 460 and 600. We have focused on proteolytic steps producing shorter N-terminal fragments, which we term cp-1 and cp-2 (distinct from previously described cp-A/cp-B). We used HEK293 cells to express the first 511 residues of huntingtin and further define the cp-1 and cp-2 cleavage sites. Based on epitope mapping with huntingtin-specific antibodies, we found that cp-1 cleavage occurs between residues 81 and 129 of huntingtin. Affinity and size exclusion chromatography were used to further purify huntingtin cleavage products and enrich for the cp-1/cp-2 fragments. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the cp-2 fragment is generated by cleavage of huntingtin at position Arg167. This site was confirmed by deletion analysis and specific detection with a custom-generated cp-2 site neo-epitope antibody. Furthermore, alterations of this cleavage site resulted in a decrease in toxicity and an increase in aggregation of huntingtin in neuronal cells. These data suggest that cleavage of huntingtin at residue Arg167 may mediate mutant huntingtin toxicity in Huntington disease.

There are at least two domains susceptible to proteolysis in the 345-kDa Htt protein (Fig. 1).

Cleavage of Htt at position 586 by caspase 6 is of particular importance for HD pathogenesis, as alterations of this site in a YAC128 HD mouse model strikingly ameliorate the phenotype (25Graham R.K. Deng Y. Slow E.J. Haigh B. Bissada N. Lu G. Pearson J. Shehadeh J. Bertram L. Murphy Z. Warby S.C. Doty C.N. Roy S. Wellington C.L. Leavitt B.R. Raymond L.A. Nicholson D.W. Hayden M.R. Cell.. 2006; 125: 1179-1191Google Scholar). Another cleavage-prone region lies near the N terminus of Htt. Lunkes and co-workers (5Lunkes A. Lindenberg K.S. Ben-Haiem L. Weber C. Devys D. Land-wehrmeyer G.B. Mandel J.L. Trottier Y. Mol. Cell.. 2002; 10: 259-269Google Scholar) described two short N-terminal Htt cleavage products, cp-A and cp-B, and mapped the cp-A cleavage site to residues 105-114. We have recently characterized two short N-terminal fragments of similar size (cp-1 and cp-2) generated in a stable inducible PC12 cell model engineered to express full-length normal and expanded Htt (30Ratovitski T. Nakamura M. D'Ambola J. Chighladze E. Liang Y. Wang W. Graham R. Hayden M.R. Borchelt D.R. Hirschhorn R.R. Ross C.A. Cell Cycle.. 2007; 6: 2970-2981Google Scholar). We found that deletion of amino acids 105-114 failed to prevent the formation of either fragment, suggesting that cp-1 is distinct from previously described cp-A. Furthermore, in previous reports cp-A/B fragments were observed only in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, whereas cp-1/2 fragments are easily detectable without proteasome inhibition in transient and stably transfected cells in our systems, suggesting that these fragments may be distinct from cp-A/B. Using the PC12 cell model we found that cp-1 and cp-2 fragments accumulate within nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions, and can be generated via a caspase independent pathway (30Ratovitski T. Nakamura M. D'Ambola J. Chighladze E. Liang Y. Wang W. Graham R. Hayden M.R. Borchelt D.R. Hirschhorn R.R. Ross C.A. Cell Cycle.. 2007; 6: 2970-2981Google Scholar). Although Htt cleavage may play an important role in HD, it is possible that not all Htt proteolytic fragments contribute to toxicity. In fact, there is growing evidence for a role of fragments of specific size in the pathogenic process. For example, YAC128 mouse HD models indicate that caspase 2- and caspase 3-generated expanded Htt fragments (552 and 513 amino acids in length, respectively) are not involved in pathogenesis, whereas the caspase 6-generated 586-amino acid fragment is pathogenic (25Graham R.K. Deng Y. Slow E.J. Haigh B. Bissada N. Lu G. Pearson J. Shehadeh J. Bertram L. Murphy Z. Warby S.C. Doty C.N. Roy S. Wellington C.L. Leavitt B.R. Raymond L.A. Nicholson D.W. Hayden M.R. Cell.. 2006; 125: 1179-1191Google Scholar). Furthermore, endogenous caspase-generated Htt fragments have different cellular distributions: caspase 2/3-generated fragments localize to the perinuclear region, whereas caspase 6-generated fragments are enriched in the nucleus (31Warby S.C. Doty C.N. Graham R.K. Carroll J.B. Yang Y.Z. Singaraja R.R. Overall C.M. Hayden M.R. Hum. Mol. Genet... 2008; 17: 2390-2404Google Scholar). Other mouse models of HD demonstrate that the exon 1 Htt fragment (R6/2 mice) (15Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Cell.. 1996; 87: 493-506Google Scholar) and the N-terminal 171-amino acid Htt fragment (N171-82Q mice) (16Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol.

Osmand A.P. Devon R.S. Lu G. Deng Y. Pearson J. Vaid K. Bissada N. Wetzel R. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2005; 102: 11402-11407Google Scholar). Thus, it is of particular interest to map the precise cleavage sites in expanded Htt and to evaluate toxic properties of specific Htt fragments formed by proteolysis. Here we employed a combination of mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis to define the cleavage events producing short N-terminal fragments of Htt. We found a potential new site of cleavage, generating the cp-2 fragment, at position Arg167. To determine a role for cp-2 in aggregation and toxicity, we generated mutations within the potential cp-2 cleavage site. Based on these studies, the presence of the cp-2 fragment is involved in Htt-induced toxicity in neuronal HT22 cells. In contrast, the N117 (shortstop) fragment is less toxic. These results support the idea that cleavage of Htt at specific sites may mediate mutant Htt toxicity in HD. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—All Htt constructs used represent N-terminal fragments and are referred to as N followed by a number of amino acids present (e.g. N511). Truncated Htt expression constructs N511-8Q/82Q were generated from previously described (11Cooper J.K. Schilling G. Peters M.F. Herring W.J. Sharp A.H. Kaminsky Z. Masone J. Khan F.A. Delanoy M. Borchelt D.R. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet... 1998; 7: 783-790Google Scholar) full-length Htt constructs (HD-FL-23/82Q) by an introduction of a stop codon after amino acid 511 of Htt. Htt-N511-32Q/52Q constructs were produced from N511-82Q by random contractions of the poly(Q) repeat in bacterial cells. Truncated Htt expression constructs N90-8Q/82Q, N117-8Q/82Q, N167-8Q/82Q, and N171-8Q/82Q were generated from Htt-N511-8Q/82Q by an introduction of a stop codon after the indicated amino acid. The stop codons and all deletions used in this study were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II XL kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Htt-N586-82Q plasmid was a gift from David Borchelt (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL) and Htt-N586-17Q/128Q plasmids were previously described (25Graham R.K. Deng Y. Slow E.J. Haigh B. Bissada N. Lu G. Pearson J. Shehadeh J. Bertram L. Murphy Z. Warby S.C. Doty C.N. Roy S. Wellington C.L. Leavitt B.R. Raymond L.A. Nicholson D.W. Hayden M.R. Cell.. 2006; 125: 1179-1191Google Scholar). The Htt-N586-52Q construct was produced from N511-82Q by random contractions of poly(Q) repeat in bacterial cells. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293FT cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml Geneticin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Mouse hippocampal HT22 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 1 g/liter d-glucose, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Mouse neuroblastoma 2a (N2a) cells (ATCC, CCL-131) were maintained in 50% Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 4.5 g/liter d-glucose), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. All cells were transfected with Htt constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purification of Htt Fragments for Mass Spectrometry—HEK293 cells were transfected with either Htt-N511-52Q or Htt-N511-8Q constructs, and lysed in M-PER buffer (Pierce) with protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture III, Calbiochem). The lysates were diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline and NaCl was added to a final concentration of 150 mm. FLAG-Htt fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from a large amount of material (15-20 mg of total protein per immunoprecipitation) using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by elution with 100 μg/ml of FLAG peptide. Eluted proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose-12 column (Amersham Biosciences) under denaturing conditions (phosphate-buffered saline, 2 m guanidine hydrochloride, 5 mm dithiothreitol) to disrupt Htt protein complexes. Collected fractions were concentrated and purified using the PAGEprep Advance kit (Pierce), and aliquots were analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody to FLAG. Fractions containing the cp-1/cp-2 fragments, or those containing only Htt-N511 were loaded on the NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were visualized with silver stain (SilverQuest kit, Invitrogen) for subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. In-gel Digestion of Htt Proteins—The bands, containing Htt proteins were manually cut out for in-gel digestion and further mass spectrometric analysis. The gel pieces were destained with a 1:1 mixture of 30 mm potassium ferricyanide and 100 mm sodium thiosulfate, rinsed 3 times with water, and incubated in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 10 min, followed by dehydration with acetonitrile. The whole cycle was repeated two more times, and the gel pieces were then dried in a SpeedVac. For in-gel digestion, gel pieces were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 10 ng/μl chymotrypsin (Roche), in 20 mm bicarbonate. The peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile and 2% formic acid (2 times). The extracts were pooled and evaporated to dryness. Mass Spectrometry of Htt Proteins: LC-MS/MS Analysis—The peptides were analyzed using QSTAR Pulsar (Applied Biosystems-MDS Sciex) interfaced with an Eksigent nano-LC system. Peptides were dissolved in 10 μl of 0.2% formic acid and 5 μl of the solution was loaded on a peptide trap and then separated on a 360 × 75-μm reverse-phase column packed with 10 cm of C18 beads (5 μm, 120 Å, YMC ODS-AQ, Waters) and a 10-μm emitter tip (New Objective). The high pressure liquid chromatography gradient was 5-40% B for 25 min (A, 0.1% formic acid; B, 90% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) and the flow rate was 300 nl/min. Survey scans were acquired from m/z 350-1200 with up to three precursors selected for MS/MS using a dynamic exclusion of 30 s. Rolling collision energy was used to promote fragmentation. The synthetic peptide MDSNLPR was analyzed in nanospray mode using Protana nanospray tips. The electrospray voltage was 900 V and MS/MS spectra of ion 416.7 m/z were acquired for 3 min. The MS/MS spectra were searched against NCBInr data base for all species, with no enzyme and 2 missed cleavages using the in-house Mascot server and Mascot Daemon as an interface. Proteins with two peptides having scores higher than probability threshold (usually 50) were considered good hits. Western Blot Analysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies to Htt, htt-(55-65) and htt-(81-90), were described previously (7Schilling G. Klevytska A. Tebbenkamp A.T. Juenemann K. Cooper J. Gonzales V. Slunt H. Poirer M. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol... 2007; 66: 313-320Google Scholar). Goat polyclonal antibody, prepared against the N-terminal Htt exon-1 fragment was described previously (33Peters M.F. Ross C.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3188-3194Google Scholar). Htt-(115-129) antibody (against residues 115-129 of Htt) and Htt-(1-82) antibody (against residues 1-82 of Htt) were from Chemicon International. The antibodies to the neo-epitope Arg167 of Htt were produced in rabbit and affinity purified against two synthetic peptides: Ac-CMDSNLPR-OH (NE167) and Ac-CGGGGNLPR-OH (Covance). For Western blotting analysis, HEK293 cells, expressing indicated constructs, were lysed (48 h after transfection) in M-PER buffer (Pierce) with protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture III, Calbiochem), and protein concentrations were estimated using the BCA method (Bio-Rad). Lysates were fractionated on NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies to Htt, FLAG (M2, Sigma), or actin (Sigma) for loading control. For immunoprecipitation, HT22 cells (1 × 150 mm dish), transfected with the indicated constructs, were lysed in M-PER buffer (Pierce) with protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture III). The lysates were diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline, and NaCl was added to a final concentration of 150 mm. Htt-FLAG fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by fractionation on NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), and detection with an antibody to exon 1 of Htt. For cell fractionation in HEK293 cells, M-PER lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g. Supernatants (soluble cytoplasmic fractions) were fractionated on NuPAGE 4-12% BisTris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) or on native PAGE 4-16% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pellets were resuspended in 2% SDS with Benzonase nuclease (Sigma) and sonicated. The resulting suspensions were either fractionated on SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4-12%), or further centrifuged at 15,000 × g to obtain the pellet of SDS-insoluble aggregates, which was than treated with formic acid at 37 °C for 30 min, as previously described (30Ratovitski T. Nakamura M. D'Ambola J. Chighladze E. Liang Y. Wang W. Graham R. Hayden M.R. Borchelt D.R. Hirschhorn R.R. Ross C.A. Cell Cycle.. 2007; 6: 2970-2981Google Scholar). Formic acid-soluble aggregates were analyzed on SDS-PAGE as above. Immunoblots were developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL-Plus detection reagent, Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—HEK293 or HT22 cells, expressing the indicated constructs, were fixed (48 h after transfection) with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10 min, blocked in 10% normal goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min, and incubated with monoclonal antibody to Htt epitope 115-129, and polyclonal antibody to the neo-epitope Arg167 of Htt, NE167 (1 h at room temperature), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG FITC-conjugated (Vector), and goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated (Vector) secondary antibodies (1 h at room temperature). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector). Microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a ×40 objective. Htt Aggregation and Cell Viability Measurements—For evaluation of Htt aggregation, N2a or HT22 cells, expressing the indicated Htt constructs, were stained with an antibody to FLAG or Htt-(1-82) antibody, followed by anti-mouse IgG FITC-conjugated antibody, and the aggregates were counted in 24-well plates in duplicate wells. 200-400 cells were counted for each construct. For cell viability assay, HT22 cells, grown in 24-well plates, were co-transfected with the indicated Htt constructs and luciferase reporter vector (pGL3-Control, Promega) in a ratio 20:1. 48 h after transfection cells from triplicate wells were lysed in 200 μl of M-PER buffer (Pierce), and luciferase activity was measured in 1/5 of the lysate using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For caspase 3 activation cytotoxicity assays, HT22 cells were transiently transected with the indicated Htt constructs. 24 h post-transfection, cells were cultured in the absence of serum for an additional 8 h. Immunofluoresence of Htt fragments and active caspase 3 was performed as described above. Htt expression was detected using an antibody to residues 1-82 of Htt (Millipore), and active caspase 3 was detected using anti-active caspase 3 antibody (Promega). Microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with a ×40 objective. In total, more than 100 transfected cells were counted per condition and the number of cells expressing both htt and active caspase 3 were presented as a percentage of the total number of htt positive cells. HEK293 Cells, Ectopically Expressing Truncated Htt Produce the cp-1 and cp-2 Fragments—To produce sufficient quantities of the cp-1 and cp-2 fragments for mass spectrometry, portions of normal and expanded Htt (N511-8Q and N-511-52Q) were expressed in HEK293 cells. Because Htt-N511 does not contain caspase cleavage sites, it may be cleaved into short N-terminal fragments via a caspase-independent pathway (30Ratovitski T. Nakamura M. D'Ambola J. Chighladze E. Liang Y. Wang W. Graham R. Hayden M.R. Borchelt D.R. Hirschhorn R.R. Ross C.A. Cell Cycle.. 2007; 6: 2970-2981Google Scholar). We found that cp-1/cp-2-like N-terminal fragments are produced from various Htt-N511 constructs and migrate on a gel in a poly(Q)-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Both fragments were detected with an antibody recognizing an N-terminal FLAG tag (data not shown), and with two Htt peptide antibodies generated against residues 55-66 and 81-90. However, only cp-2 was detected with an antibody recognizing the epitope between residues 115 and 129. Based on epitope mapping, the cp-1 cleavage site is located between residues 81 and 129 of Htt. Thus, cp-1 and cp-2 fragments, generated from Htt-N511 cleavage in HEK293 cells appear comparable with those resulting from Htt-N1212 and full-length Htt cleavage in HEK293 and stable PC12 cells (30Ratovitski T. Nakamura M. D'Ambola J. Chighladze E. Liang Y. Wang W. Graham R. Hayden M.R. Borchelt D.R. Hirschhorn R.R. Ross C.A. Cell Cycle.. 2007; 6: 2970-2981Google Scholar). Purification of the cp-1 and cp-2 fragments for mass spectrometry was carried out in two steps. In the first step, FLAG-tagged Htt proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation from HEK293 cell lysates using FLAG-agarose and a large quantity of starting material (15-20 mg of total protein per immunoprecipitation). Following elution with a FLAG peptide, the proteins were further purified using size exclusion chromatography. This step was performed under denaturing conditions to disrupt Htt protein complexes and enrich for the cp-1/cp-2 fragments (see ""Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of sizing column fractions by Western blotting with an antibody to the FLAG demonstrated that the cp-1/cp-2 fragments were enriched in fractions 26 through 28, whereas Htt-N511 was predominantly found in fractions 23 and 24 (Fig. 2B, left panels). These fractions were then separated on the gel and proteins were visualized with silver stain (Fig. 2B, right panel). Htt bands corresponding to the cp-1 and cp-2 fragments, as well as bands containing only Htt-N511, were processed for mass spectrometry. Detection of the Cp-2 Cleavage Site by Mass Spectrometry—Following excision from the gel (Fig. 2B, right panel), Htt-8Q and Htt-52Q protein bands, described above, were subjected to in-gel digestion with chymotrypsin. The peptides were eluted from the gel and processed by LC-MS/MS (see ""Experimental Procedures”) for peptide identification. Chymotrypsin cleaves proteins after the following residues: phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, and histidine. As result of our experiments, we identified a number of Htt peptides produced by chymotrypsin cleavage of the N511 band, and 2 peptides resulting from digestion of the cp-2 band (Fig. 3A, data shown for Htt-8Q). One of these peptides, MDSNLPR, ending at arginine (Arg167 of Htt), cannot be generated by chymotrypsin and may represent the C terminus of the cp-2 fragment generated by an endogenous cleavage event. Furthermore, this peptide was only detected in the digest of the cp-2 band (Fig. 3B). We failed to detect MDSNLPR peptide in digests of the N511 band from fractions 26 to 28, or in fractions 23-24 lacking any cp-1/cp-2 fragments, even though the N511 band contains ∼10 times more Htt protein than the band corresponding to the cp-2 fragment. We found, however, four longer peptides produced by chymotrypsin digest of the N511 band within the same region of Htt (Table 1). These data strongly suggest that the cp-2 cleavage site is located at position Arg167 of Htt.Table 1Huntingtin peptides identified around sequence MDSNLPR N511 band Peptide score Cp-2 fragment band Peptide score MDSNLPRL 26 MDSNLPR 41 MDSNLPRLQ 59 MDSNLPRLQL 37 MDSNLPRLQLELY 30 Open table in a new tab Because the Mascot score (41Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol... 2005; 6: 891-898Google Scholar) for the MDSNLPR peptide was below the 95% confidence threshold, we obtained additional confirmation of the peptide sequence: the MDSNLPR peptide fragmentation spectrum from the digest of cp-2 was compared with that of a synthetic peptide of the same sequence (Fig. 3C). The two fragmentation spectra patterns and masses matched closely, confirming that the peptide detected in the cp-2 fragment digest is indeed MDSNLPR. The data shown were generated for the cp-2 fragment derived from Htt-N511-8Q. A peptide of the same mass and with the same retention time was also detected in the digest of cp-2 derived from Htt-511-52Q (data not shown). However, we failed to detect any Htt peptides indicative of potential cp-1 cleavage from trypsin or chymotrypsin digests of either Htt-8Q or Htt-52Q bands (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2035143687,"Multiple system atrophy is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of aggregated Ser-129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in oligodendrocytes. p25alpha is an oligodendroglial protein that potently stimulates alpha-synuclein aggregation in vitro. To model multiple system atrophy, we coexpressed human p25alpha and alpha-synuclein in the rat oligodendroglial cell line OLN-93 and observed a cellular response characterized by a fast retraction of microtubules from the cellular processes to the perinuclear region followed by a protracted development of apoptosis. This response was dependent on phosphorylation at Ser-129 in alpha-synuclein as demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis. Treatment of the cells with the kinase inhibitor 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H benzimidazole that targets kinases like casein kinase 2, and polo-like kinases abrogated the toxicity. The polo-like kinase inhibitor BI 2536 caused apoptosis in the model. Ser-129 phosphorylation was linked to the formation of phosphorylated oligomers detectable by immunoblotting, and their formation was inhibited by 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H benzimidazole. The process of microtubule retraction was also dependent on aggregation as demonstrated by the protective effect of treating the cells with the specific peptide inhibitor of alpha-synuclein aggregation ASI1D and the non-selective inhibitors Congo Red and baicalein. The fast microtubule retraction was followed by the development of the apoptotic markers: activated caspase-3, phosphatidylserine externalization, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation. These markers could all be blocked by the inhibitors of phosphorylation, aggregation, and caspase-3. Hence, the model predicts that both Ser-129 phosphorylation and aggregation control the toxic alpha-syn pathway in oligodendroglial cells and may represent therapeutic intervention points in multiple system atrophy."

Previous studies showed that Scl is essential for embryonic and adult erythropoiesis, while Lyl1 is important for B cell development. Single-knockout mice have not revealed an essential function for Scl or Lyl1 in adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To determine if maintenance of HSCs in single-knockout mice is due to functional redundancy, we generated Lyl1;Scl-conditional double-knockout mice. Here, we report a striking genetic interaction between the two genes, with a clear dose dependence for the presence of Scl or Lyl1 alleles for HSC function. Bone marrow repopulation assays and analyses demonstrated rapid loss of hematopoietic progenitors due to apoptosis. The function of HSCs could be rescued by a single allele of Lyl1 but not Scl. These results show that expression of at least one of these factors is essential for maintenance of adult HSC function.

Bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can self-renew and differentiate to generate the diverse lineages of the blood. Critical in hematopoietic development and adult homeostasis are a number of transcription factors, many of which are dysregulated in human leukemias (Look, 1997Look A.T.

The Stem Cell Leukemia gene (SCL/TAL1), first identified at a translocation breakpoint in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), is a tissue-restricted member of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class of transcription factors that has been termed a master regulator of hematopoiesis because gene-targeting studies have shown that it is essential for the formation of HSCs (Robb et al., 1995Robb L. Lyons I. Li R. Hartley L. Kontgen F. Harvey R.P. Metcalf D. Begley C.G. Absence of yolk sac hematopoiesis from mice with a targeted disruption of the scl gene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Absence of blood formation in mice lacking the T-cell leukaemia oncoprotein tal-1/SCL.Nature. 1995; 373: 432-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). However, conditional deletion of Scl in adult HSCs has relatively little effect: Scl null adult HSCs have impaired short-term repopulating ability, predominantly of the myeloid lineage, but no defects in long-term repopulation or self-renewal (Curtis et al., 2004Curtis D.J. Hall M.A. Van Stekelenburg L.J. Robb L. Jane S.M. Begley C.G. SCL is required for normal function of short-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 2004; 103: 3342-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, Scl is essential for the formation but not maintenance of adult HSCs (Mikkola et al., 2003Mikkola H.K. Klintman J. Yang H. Hock H. Schlaeger T.M. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Haematopoietic stem cells retain long-term repopulating activity and multipotency in the absence of stem-cell leukaemia SCL/tal-1 gene.Nature. 2003; 421: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for redundancy of Scl in adult HSCs is expression of the related bHLH transcription factor Lyl1. However, Lyl1 cannot rescue early lethality of Scl null mice despite similar patterns of embryonic expression (Giroux et al., 2007Giroux S. Kaushik A.L. Capron C. Jalil A. Kelaidi C. Sablitzky F. Dumenil D. Albagli O. Godin I. lyl-1 and tal-1/scl, two genes encoding closely related bHLH transcription factors, display highly overlapping expression patterns during cardiovascular and hematopoietic ontogeny.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and enforced expression of Lyl1 in Scl−/− embryonic stem cells did not rescue their defective development (Porcher et al., 1999Porcher C. Liao E.C. Fujiwara Y. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H. Specification of hematopoietic and vascular development by the bHLH transcription factor SCL without direct DNA binding.Development. 1999; 126: 4603-4615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), arguing that Lyl1 cannot compensate for Scl in developmental hematopoiesis. In adult hematopoiesis, Lyl1 is expressed more broadly than Scl, in myeloid and B cell lineages as well as HSCs. In contrast to Scl, Lyl1 is dispensable for hematopoietic development. Transplantation assays of Lyl1 null HSCs revealed defective lymphoid but normal myeloid repopulation, suggesting that Lyl1 is also dispensable for adult HSCs (Capron et al., 2006Capron C. Lecluse Y. Kaushik A.L. Foudi A. Lacout C. Sekkai D. Godin I. Albagli O. Poullion I. Svinartchouk F. et al.The SCL relative LYL-1 is required for fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cell function and B-cell differentiation.Blood. 2006; 107: 4678-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that Scl and Lyl1 can compensate for each other in adult HSCs, we generated Lyl1;Scl-conditional double-knockout mice to study the potential genetic interaction between the two genes in adult hematopoiesis. To examine possible functional redundancy between Lyl1 and Scl, we generated Mx-Cre;Lyl1−/−;Sclfl/fl mice. Blood counts including platelets in mice lacking one or both alleles of Lyl1 were normal prior to deletion of the Sclfl alleles (see Figure S1A available online). Four weeks after deletion of the Sclfl allele (SclΔ), Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ mice had a higher platelet count compared with Mx;Lyl1+/−;SclΔ/Δ mice (Figure S1B). Other blood parameters including red cells and B cells were normal in Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ and control mice (data not shown). Unlike the original report (Capron et al., 2006Capron C. Lecluse Y. Kaushik A.L. Foudi A. Lacout C. Sekkai D. Godin I. Albagli O. Poullion I. Svinartchouk F. et al.The SCL relative LYL-1 is required for fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cell function and B-cell differentiation.Blood. 2006; 107: 4678-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), our Lyl1 null colony had normal numbers of peripheral blood B cells. Eight weeks after poly(I:C), we observed reduced Meg-CFC and BFU-E and increased mast-CFC in control Mx;Lyl1+/+;SclΔ/Δ and Mx;Lyl1+/−;SclΔ/Δ mice as we previously described (Hall et al., 2003Hall M.A. Curtis D.J. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Sourris K. Robb L. Gothert J.R. Jane S.M. Begley C.G. The critical regulator of embryonic hematopoiesis, SCL, is vital in the adult for megakaryopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and lineage choice in CFU-S12.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, Salmon et al., 2007Salmon J.M. Slater N.J. Hall M.A. McCormack M.P. Nutt S.L. Jane S.M. Curtis D.J. Aberrant mast-cell differentiation in mice lacking the stem-cell leukemia gene.Blood. 2007; 110: 3573-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Remarkably, Mx;Lyl1−/−; SclΔ/Δ mice had normal numbers of BFU-E (Figure S1C) Meg-CFC and no aberrant mast cell differentiation (Figure 1A). There were two possible explanations for improved platelet count and progenitor growth in Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ mice: either selective outgrowth of nondeleted, Scl-expressing (Sclfl/fl) progenitors, or the absence of Lyl1 rescued SclΔ/Δ growth defects. Southern blot of hematopoietic organs from Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ mice showing almost no deleted Sclfl allele suggested that selection of nondeleted Sclfl/fl cells was the most likely explanation (Figure S1D). To definitively demonstrate that myeloid and erythroid colonies generated from Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ mice were derived from Sclfl/fl progenitors, single colonies were genotyped, revealing that all myeloid and BFU-E progenitors from Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ mice had at least one Sclfl allele (Figure 1B). In contrast, all colonies from control Mx;Lyl1+/−;SclΔ/Δ mice were Scl deleted (SclΔ/Δ). These results indicate that SclΔ/Δ myeloid progenitors have a significant growth disadvantage in the absence of Lyl1. To determine whether the defect observed in myeloid progenitors extended to HSCs, we performed competitive repopulation assays using whole bone marrow obtained from Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ mice. Mice were injected three times with poly(I:C) on alternate days, and bone marrow cells were harvested for transplantation the day following the last injection to minimize potential outgrowth of nondeleted Sclfl/fl HSCs (Figure S2A). Peripheral blood analysis revealed that Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ bone marrow cells contributed to less than 1% of the recipients' peripheral blood production compared with wild-type (WT) bone marrow donor cells, which comprised approximately 40% of hematopoiesis by 16 weeks (Figure S2B). Both Lyl−/− and Mx;SclΔ/Δ single-knockout bone marrow cells exhibited milder repopulating defects as previously reported (Capron et al., 2006Capron C. Lecluse Y. Kaushik A.L. Foudi A. Lacout C. Sekkai D. Godin I. Albagli O. Poullion I. Svinartchouk F. et al.The SCL relative LYL-1 is required for fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cell function and B-cell differentiation.Blood. 2006; 107: 4678-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Curtis et al., 2004Curtis D.J. Hall M.A. Van Stekelenburg L.J. Robb L. Jane S.M. Begley C.G. SCL is required for normal function of short-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 2004; 103: 3342-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Even with a 25-fold excess of transplanted donor cells, Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ gave rise to only 4% engraftment 16 weeks posttransplant (Figure S2C). The inability of Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ HSCs to repopulate and expand in lethally irradiated recipients could be due to a homing defect. Therefore, we repeated the transplantation assay inducing deletion of the Scl alleles after, rather than before, transplantation (Figure 1C). Five to six weeks after transplant, recipient mice received three doses of poly(I:C) every other day to induce deletion of the Sclfl allele, and initial peripheral blood chimerism was determined 2 weeks later. Hematopoietic contribution by Mx;Lyl1−/−;Sclfl/fl HSCs fell from 20% to less than 5% within 2 weeks after the start of poly(I:C) administration (Figure 1D), whereas there was no significant effect of poly(I:C) administration on contribution by WT or single-knockout donor cells. To determine the status of the Scl allele of the cells derived from Mx;Lyl1−/−;Sclfl/fl HSCs after poly(I:C), we sorted donor CD45.2+ bone marrow cells into methylcellulose medium to generate colonies for PCR genotyping. All donor-derived cells in both transplant experiments contained at least one Sclfl allele (Figures 1E and 1F). These nondeleted cells had escaped deletion but did not increase over time because the WT competitor cells had eliminated selective pressure for expansion. HSCs, therefore, require either Lyl1 or Scl to contribute to steady-state adult hematopoiesis. To examine if one allele of Lyl1 was sufficient to maintain HSC function in the absence of Scl, we tested donor bone marrow cells with the genotype Mx;Lyl1+/−;Sclfl/fl. Compared with Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ cells, Mx;Lyl1+/−;SclΔ/Δ cells provided stable hematopoiesis for at least 16 weeks after deletion of the Sclfl allele (Figure 1G). PCR genotyping of colonies derived from sorted donor Mx;Lyl1+/−;SclΔ/Δ cells confirmed the Scl null (SclΔ/Δ) genotype (data not shown). These results demonstrate that a single allele of Lyl1 in the absence of Scl is sufficient to maintain HSC activity. The data above suggested that one WT Lyl1 allele was sufficient to maintain adult HSC function. To examine if one WT Scl allele was sufficient, we crossed the Lyl1−/− mice to Scl+/− mice (Elefanty et al., 1998Elefanty A.G. Begley C.G. Metcalf D. Barnett L. Kontgen F. Robb L. Characterization of hematopoietic progenitor cells that express the transcription factor SCL, using a lacZ “knock-in” strategy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 11897-11902Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). By using Scl+/− mice rather than Mx;Scl+/fl mice, we avoid the complications of competition between HSCs bearing nondeleted Sclfl and deleted SclΔ alleles. Since Lyl1−/−;Scl+/− pups are not viable, as previously reported (Chan et al., 2007Chan W.Y. Follows G.A. Lacaud G. Pimanda J.E. Landry J.R. Kinston S. Knezevic K. Piltz S. Donaldson I.J. Gambardella L. et al.The paralogous hematopoietic regulators Lyl1 and Scl are coregulated by Ets and GATA factors, but Lyl1 cannot rescue the early Scl−/− phenotype.Blood. 2007; 109: 1908-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we examined HSC activity using 14.5 dpc fetal liver, where HSCs reside during late development. Lyl1+/−, Lyl1−/−, Lyl1+/−;Scl+/− and Lyl1−/−;Scl+/− fetal liver cells were assayed by competitive transplantation against WT bone marrow (Figure 2A). Lyl1−/− fetal liver cells had a mild repopulation defect compared with Lyl1+/− or Lyl1+/−;Scl+/− fetal liver cells (Figure 2B). Remarkably, Lyl1−/−;Scl+/− fetal liver HSCs had a severe repopulation defect with almost complete absence of donor cells by 8 weeks posttransplant. Thus, a single Scl allele in the absence of Lyl1 was unable to maintain HSC activity. The inability to identify Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ cells in Mx;Lyl1−/−;Sclfl/fl mice after poly(I:C) or competitive transplantation (Figure 1) suggested that expression of either Scl or Lyl1 is essential for the survival, growth, or differentiation of adult HSCs. In order to determine the fate of Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ HSCs, we treated Mx;Lyl1−/−;Sclfl/fl mice with poly(I:C) for six injections on alternate days and harvested bone marrow cells 2 hr after the last injection. Mx;Lyl1+/−;Sclfl/fl mice were used as controls because they had normal repopulating activity (Figure 1G). Flow cytometric analysis of Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ bone marrow revealed a normal number of lineage-negative cells (Linneg) but a variable, and on occasions dramatic, loss of Linneg c-Kit+ Sca-1− cells (LK) and the more immature Linneg c-Kit+ Sca-1+ cells (LKS) (Figure 3A). Overall, there was a two-fold loss of LK cells and LKS cells immediately after Scl deletion (Figure 3B). Annexin V expression on LK cells revealed a three-fold increase in apoptotic cells (Figure 3C). PCR genotyping confirmed that most LKS cells were truly Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ but the LK fraction contained significant numbers of nondeleted Sclfl cells (Figure 3D). Culture of Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ LKS generated ten-fold fewer colonies than control cultures (Figure 3E), and PCR genotyping demonstrated that all colonies from Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ LKS cells were derived from either Scl-heterozygous (SclΔ/fl) or Scl-wild-type (Sclfl/fl) cells (Figure 3F). Colonies from sorted Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ LK cells were mostly Scl-wild-type (Figure 3G), consistent with selection of nondeleted cells in the transition from LKS to LK cells (Figure 3D). Consistent with normal HSC activity of Mx;Lyl1+/−;SclΔ/Δ cells (Figure 1G), all colonies from Mx;Lyl1+/−;Sclfl/fl LK cells were fully deleted (Figure 3G). The analyses of Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ mice immediately after poly(I:C) suggested that apoptosis was the explanation for the rapid loss of donor Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ cells in the transplanted mice (Figure 1B). To test this, recipients of bone marrow from Mx;Lyl1−/−; Sclfl/fl mice were given one dose of poly(I:C) and were analyzed 2 days later. The contribution of Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ cells to bone marrow was three times lower in the poly(I:C)-treated mice than the PBS-treated controls as early as 2 days after treatment (Figure 4A). The percentage of apoptotic and dead cells, measured with Annexin V staining, was almost 50% of the total donor-derived cells, and three-fold greater than the controls. Analysis of the WT competitor cells in the same mice showed no difference (Figure 4B), suggesting that this phenotype is cell intrinsic and unique to the Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ cells. In order to exclude the possibility of toxicity by poly(I:C) or an effect of the microenvironment, we induced deletion of the Sclfl allele in vitro. Bone marrow progenitors (Sca-1+) were isolated from Lyl1−/−;Sclfl/fl mice and transduced with an MSCV-based retroviral vector that carries the Cre recombinase gene coupled to GFP, or a control GFP-only vector. Cells were cultured for 48 hr, and the GFP-positive fraction was analyzed for apoptosis using Annexin V (Figure 4C). Strikingly, 23% of the Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ Sca1+ progenitor cells that were transduced with the Cre-expressing virus were apoptotic, four times higher than the control group (Figure 4D). This suggests that the increased rate of apoptosis of the Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ cells is cell intrinsic and independent of the environment and takes place rapidly after deletion of the Scl allele. These results demonstrate that HSCs and progenitors lacking both Lyl1 and Scl cannot survive. Scl has been extensively studied and found to be a crucial factor in hematopoietic development; loss of Scl during embryonic development leads to absence of hematopoietic progenitors and vascular defects (Robb et al., 1995Robb L. Lyons I. Li R. Hartley L. Kontgen F. Harvey R.P. Metcalf D. Begley C.G. Absence of yolk sac hematopoiesis from mice with a targeted disruption of the scl gene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Surprisingly, conditional loss of Scl in the adult impacts short-term, but not long-term repopulation (Curtis et al., 2004Curtis D.J. Hall M.A. Van Stekelenburg L.J. Robb L. Jane S.M. Begley C.G.

Lyl1 is a related bHLH transcription factor with near identity in the bHLH region, and a similar expression pattern (Giroux et al., 2007Giroux S. Kaushik A.L. Capron C. Jalil A. Kelaidi C. Sablitzky F. Dumenil D. Albagli O. Godin I. lyl-1 and tal-1/scl, two genes encoding closely related bHLH transcription factors, display highly overlapping expression patterns during cardiovascular and hematopoietic ontogeny.Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 7: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that some redundancy exists between the two genes, despite the inability of Lyl1 to rescue Scl during development (Chan et al., 2007Chan W.Y. Follows G.A. Lacaud G. Pimanda J.E. Landry J.R. Kinston S. Knezevic K. Piltz S. Donaldson I.J. Gambardella L. et al.The paralogous hematopoietic regulators Lyl1 and Scl are coregulated by Ets and GATA factors, but Lyl1 cannot rescue the early Scl−/− phenotype.Blood. 2007; 109: 1908-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Porcher et al., 1999Porcher C. Liao E.C. Fujiwara Y. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H. Specification of hematopoietic and vascular development by the bHLH transcription factor SCL without direct DNA binding.Development. 1999; 126: 4603-4615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By inducing Scl deletion on a Lyl1−/− background, we investigated a potential collaboration between these two genes for maintenance of adult hematopoiesis. Our results demonstrate that Lyl1 is essential for maintaining normal HSC function in the absence of Scl. Specifically, Scl null HSCs expressing a single allele of Lyl1 (Lyl1+/−;SclΔ/Δ) engraft normally in transplantation assays and can maintain long-term hematopoiesis while Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ HSCs undergo rapid apoptosis. Therefore, adult Scl null HSCs survive because of functional redundancy with Lyl1, indicating that bHLH factors are critical not only for the formation of HSCs but also for their maintenance in the adult. Functional redundancy is a feature of other bHLH proteins in other cell types. For example, during development of skeletal muscle, MyoD and Myf5 exhibit functional redundancy early in the myogenic lineage in establishing myoblast identity (Rawls et al., 1998Rawls A. Valdez M.R. Zhang W. Richardson J. Klein W.H. Olson E.N. Overlapping functions of the myogenic bHLH genes MRF4 and MyoD revealed in double mutant mice.Development. 1998; 125: 2349-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar way, a threshold may be required in adult HSCs in order to maintain optimal function. Increasing loss of additional alleles of Lyl1 and Scl leads to proportional loss of HSC function, as illustrated most clearly in Figure 2. Analyses immediately following poly(I:C) demonstrated a relatively pure population of Mx;Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ cells within the LKS cell fraction; however, these cells were unable to grow in culture (Figure 3). This failure to grow was reflected by the presence of cells with the nondeleted Sclfl allele within the more mature LK progenitor cell fraction (Figure 3D). The increased expression of Annexin V on LKS and LK cells suggests that survival of primitive progenitors, including HSCs, is dependent on the presence of at least one of these bHLH factors. Because hematopoiesis is a dynamic process with many stem cells and progenitors generating progeny at any given time, a growth advantage of cells with one wild-type Scl allele would rapidly result in their predominance. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ cells remain alive but quiescent and that Lyl1 or Scl are required for expansion of primitive progenitors in vivo. The functional redundancy between Lyl1 and Scl in adult HSCs is surprising given the inability of Lyl1 to rescue Scl null hematopoiesis (Chan et al., 2007Chan W.Y. Follows G.A. Lacaud G. Pimanda J.E. Landry J.R. Kinston S. Knezevic K. Piltz S. Donaldson I.J. Gambardella L. et al.The paralogous hematopoietic regulators Lyl1 and Scl are coregulated by Ets and GATA factors, but Lyl1 cannot rescue the early Scl−/− phenotype.Blood. 2007; 109: 1908-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Porcher et al., 1999Porcher C.

Specification of hematopoietic and vascular development by the bHLH transcription factor SCL without direct DNA binding.Development. 1999; 126: 4603-4615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the two genes have almost identical bHLH domains, and therefore similar DNA and protein binding properties to E proteins (Miyamoto et al., 1996Miyamoto A. Cui X. Naumovski L. Cleary M.L. Helix-loop-helix proteins LYL1 and E2a form heterodimeric complexes with distinctive DNA-binding properties in hematolymphoid cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2394-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Lmo2 (Wadman et al., 1994Wadman I. Li J. Bash R.O. Forster A. Osada H. Rabbitts T.H. Baer R. Specific in vivo association between the bHLH and LIM proteins implicated in human T cell leukemia.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4831-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), genes essential for hematopoietic development and lineage commitment. The rapid death of Lyl1−/−;SclΔ/Δ cells makes it challenging to determine the precise downstream mediators of this effect. However, given the broad range of interactions of bHLH proteins and the wide range of transcriptional target genes, the phenotype that we observe in the double knockouts most likely arises due to disruption of multiple transcription networks. Transcriptional targets that could contribute to the phenotype include c-kit, Gata2, and Runx1, which are targets of Scl, possibly also of Lyl1, and have been implicated in the regulation of HSC survival and proliferation (Krosl et al., 1998Krosl G. He G. Lefrancois M. Charron F. Romeo P.H. Jolicoeur P. Kirsch I.R. Nemer M. Hoang T. Transcription factor SCL is required for c-kit expression and c-Kit function in hemopoietic cells.J. Exp.

USA. 2007; 104: 17692-17697Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The clear dose sensitivity for optimal HSC engraftment that is evident with decreasing allele number (Figure 2) highlights the relatively narrow tolerance for perturbations in the amounts of bHLH transcription factors for optimal hematopoiesis. Likewise, studies with knockout or overexpression of related bHLH factors, such as E2A and Id2, support this view (Cochrane et al., 2008Cochrane S.W. Zhao Y. Welner R.S. Sun X.H. Balance between Id and E proteins regulates myeloid versus lymphoid lineage decisions.Blood. 2008; (Published online October 16, 2008)https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2008-06-164996Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, Engel and Murre, 2001Engel I.

Yokota Y. Keller J.R. Id2 intrinsically regulates lymphoid and erythroid development via interaction with different target proteins.Blood. 2008; 112: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This redundancy, coupled with dose sensitivity, has important implications for the potential mechanisms that ensure fine-tuning of the dynamic production of various blood cell components under different types of demand. Even though Lyl1 and Scl are functionally redundant in adult HSCs, their relative roles during development and adult hematopoiesis appear to differ. Expression of Scl:Lyl1 chimeric proteins (Porcher et al., 1999Porcher C. Liao E.C. Fujiwara Y. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H. Specification of hematopoietic and vascular development by the bHLH transcription factor SCL without direct DNA binding.Development. 1999; 126: 4603-4615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that protein-protein interactions outside the bHLH mediate their distinct roles in development. Furthermore, the observation that Scl null HSCs with one intact allele of Lyl1 function relatively normally (Figure 1G), while Lyl1 null HSCs with one allele of Scl engraft very poorly (Figure 2B), suggests that Lyl1 is more important for adult HSCs. Their functional redundancy in adult HSCs may also account for their similar contribution to human T cell leukemia when aberrantly expressed. Interestingly, LYL1-positive T-ALLs display more primitive stem-cell-like characteristics than SCL-positive samples (Ferrando et al., 2002Ferrando A.A. Neuberg D.S. Staunton J. Loh M.L. Huard C. Raimondi S.C. Behm F.G. Pui C.H. Downing J.R. Gilliland D.G. et al.Gene expression signatures define novel oncogenic pathways in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 75-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), perhaps consistent with a more important role for LYL1 in human HSCs, as our data suggest for murine HSC. Further studies defining the common and distinct functions of these key bHLH proteins will provide valuable insights in both embryonic and adult hematopoiesis, as well as their leukemogenic properties. Mice with a floxed Scl allele (Sclfl/fl) and Lyl1−/− mice were generated as described before (Capron et al., 2006Capron C. Lecluse Y. Kaushik A.L. Foudi A. Lacout C. Sekkai D. Godin I. Albagli O. Poullion I. Svinartchouk F. et al.The SCL relative LYL-1 is required for fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cell function and B-cell differentiation.Blood. 2006; 107: 4678-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Hall et al., 2003Hall M.A. Curtis D.J.

USA. 2003; 100: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Sclfl/fl were crossed to the Mx-Cre transgenic strain (Kuhn et al., 1995Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar) and then to Lyl1−/− mice; their progeny was intercrossed to generate double knockouts, Lyl1−/−; Sclfl/fl ; Mx-Cre. All mice are on a C57Bl/6 background and were housed in a specific-pathogen-free animal facility, AALAC-accredited, at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX) or at Bio21 Institute (Melbourne, VIC). Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse tails and digested in DNA lysis buffer (Gerard Biotech). Primer sequences used for PCR amplification of the Lyl1 WT allele were 5′-AAGCTGAGCAAGAACGAGGTGC-3′ and 5′-TCTGCTCCAACTTGATGGGTCTC-3′, and for the lacZ knockin allele were 5′-AGTGGGCGCCCTCTGTCCTCTA-3′ and 5′-TAATTCGCGTCTGGCCTTCCTGTA-3′. Primer sequences used for PCR amplification of floxed and deleted Scl alleles were 5′-TCCCAAGCCCAAAGATTTCCCCAATG-3′, 5′-GCAAGCTGGATGGATCAACATGGACCT-3′, and 5′-ATGCTTGGATGCTTGGTTCAGAG-3′. Primer sequences used for PCR amplification of the Scl lacZ knockin allele were 5′-GGATGGCGGGGCACACGAGGTAA-3′ and 5′-TGCCAGTTTGAGGGGACGACGACA-3′. The Sclfl allele was deleted by inducing expression of the Mx-Cre by injecting mice intraperitoneally between one and six times with 300 μg of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C); Sigma (St. Louis, MO)] in PBS. The extent of deletion was determined by performing either PCR or Southern blotting using a probe that distinguishes floxed, deleted, and WT Scl alleles (Hall et al., 2003Hall M.A. Curtis D.J. Metcalf D. Elefanty A.G. Sourris K. Robb L. Gothert J.R. Jane S.M. Begley C.G.

USA. 2003; 100: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For platelet counts, peripheral blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus into tubes containing potassium EDTA (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) and analyzed with an Advia 120 automated hematological analyzer (Bayer, Tarrytown, NY). Bone marrow cells were cultured in 0.3% agar for 7 days, stained for acetylcholinesterase, followed by Luxol Fast Blue and hematoxylin/eosin and analyzed as described previously (Metcalf, 1984Metcalf D. Haemopoietic Colony-Stimulating Factors. Elsevier, Amsterdam1984Google Scholar). Recombinant cytokines were used at the following concentrations: 10 ng/ml mIL-3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 50 ng/ml SCF (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA), and 10 ng/ml human megakaryocyte growth and differentiation factor (MGDF; Amgen Inc.). For BFU-E, bone marrow cells were plated in 0.9% methylcellulose for 7 days with 10 ng/ml mIL-3, 50 ng/ml SCF, and 4 U/ml erythropoietin (EPO; Amgen Inc.) and enumerated in situ after staining for hemoglobinized erythroid colonies using 2,7-diaminofluorene. Competitive bone marrow transplantation assays were performed by intravenous injection of admixed CD45.2 donor whole bone marrow cells with CD45.1 competitor bone marrow. Lyl1 and Scl single- and double-knockout mice carried the CD45.2 allele. Recipient C57Bl/6 mice had been lethally irradiated with a split dose of 10.5 Gy, 3 hr apart. Sex- and age-matched C57Bl/6 mice were used as competitors for every experiment. The competitor cell dose was kept constant at 250,000 cells in all transplants except those shown in Figure 1G, where the competitor dose was 500,000 cells. Lyl1−/− females in estrous were put together with Lyl1−/+;ScllacZ/+ males and were checked for vaginal plugs the next morning, designated as 0.5 days postcoitum (dpc). At 14.5 dpc, fetal liver was dissected from the fetuses, and single-cell suspensions were prepared in Hank's balanced salt solution (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA). Fetal liver cells were used in a 2:1 ratio with WT competitor bone marrow in a transplantation assay as described above. The genotypes were determined using a small amount of tissue from the fetuses prior to the transplant, prepared, and genotyped as described above. For peripheral blood analysis, mice were bled at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks posttransplantation. Red blood cells were lysed and samples were stained with CD45.1-APC, CD45.2-FITC, CD4-pacific blue, CD8-pacific blue, B220-pacific blue, B220-PE-cy7, Mac1-PE-cy7, and Gr-1-PE-cy-7 antibodies (BD Pharmingen, eBiosciences). FacsARIA, FacsCalibur, LSRII, and FACS-Scan flow cytometers were used for analysis and sorting. Whole bone marrow from recipient animals was harvested, stained with CD45.2-FITC antibody (eBiosciences), and sorted using a FACS-Aria. CD45.2-positive cells were plated in Methocult GF M3434 (StemCell Technologies Inc.) or 0.3% agar as described and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. Colonies formed at approximately day 10 were picked, and DNA was isolated (Gerard Biotech DNA isolation kit) and genotyped using the Scl-WT/floxed primers used in mouse genotyping. Annexin V and PI or Fluoro-Gold staining was used to assess cell death and apoptosis. Briefly, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated at room temperature in 1× binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2) containing either Annexin V-APC (BD-Pharmingen) and PI or Annexin V-FITC, Sca1-PE, c kit-APC, lineage markers (B220, Ter119, Gr1, Mac1, CD3)-PerCP/Cy5.5, and Fluoro-Gold. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 hr of staining. MSCV-Cre-IRES-GFP and MSCV-IRES-GFP retroviruses were generated as previously described (Chambers et al., 2007Chambers S.M. Boles N.C.

In humans, severe hyperhomocysteinemia due to genetic alterations in cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs) or methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr) results in neurological abnormalities and premature death from vascular complications. In mouse models, dietary or genetic hyperhomocysteinemia results in liver or brain pathological changes and accelerates atherosclerosis. Hcy-thiolactone has the ability to form isopeptide bonds with protein lysine residues, which generates modified proteins (N-Hcy-protein) with autoimmunogenic and prothrombotic properties. Our aim was to determine how N-Hcy-protein levels are affected by genetic or nutritional disorders in Hcy or folate metabolism in mice. We found that plasma N-Hcy-protein was elevated 10-fold in mice fed a high-methionine diet compared with the animals fed a normal commercial diet. We also found that inactivation of Cbs, Mthfr, or the proton-coupled folate transporter (Pcft) gene resulted in a 10- to 30-fold increase in plasma or serum N-Hcy-protein levels. Liver N-Hcy-protein was elevated 3.4-fold in severely and 11-fold in extremely hyperhomocysteinemic Cbs-deficient mice, 3.6-fold in severely hyperhomocysteinemic Pcft mice, but was not elevated in mildly hyperhomocysteinemic Mthfr-deficient animals, suggesting that mice have a capacity to prevent accumulation of N-Hcy-protein in their organs. These findings provide evidence that N-Hcy-protein is an important metabolite associated with Hcy pathophysiology in the mouse."

Leist M. Groc L. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 993-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). An excess of free radicals damages essential macromolecules of the cell, leading to abnormal gene expression, disturbances in receptor activity, cell proliferation, immune perturbation, or cell death. OS is the major player in numerous human diseases such as cancer, ocular degeneration, and neurodegenerative diseases, including AIDS-associated neuropathies (2.Sacktor N. Haughey N. Cutler R. Tamara A. Turchan J. Pardo C. Vargas D. Nath A. J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 157: 176-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). OS is involved in many aspects of HIV disease pathogenesis, including viral replication (3.Hervouet E. Simonnet H. Godinot C. Biochimie (Paris). 2007; 89: 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), inflammatory responses, decreased immune cell proliferation, loss of immune function, chronic weight loss, and increased sensitivity to drug toxicity (4.Kimura H. Sawada T. Oshima S. Kozawa K. Ishioka T. Kato M. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2005; 4: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Active replication of HIV in macrophages and microglia represents a reservoir for virus and an important step for HIV neuropathogenesis (5.Mollace V. Nottet H.S. Clayette P. Turco M.C. Muscoli C. Salvemini D. Perno C.F. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 411-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This process leads to production of inflammatory products and free radical species (6.Price T.O. Uras F. Banks W.A. Ercal N. Exp.

Because macrophages and microglia function as a long term reservoir for HIV-1, these cells must possess a mechanism to protect themselves against the toxic effects of superoxide anions. In this regard, HIV-1 Tat has been shown to induce neuronal death via TNF-α induction and activation of the OS pathway (7.New D.R. Maggirwar S.B. Epstein L.G. Dewhurst S. Gelbard H.A. J. Biol.

Booze R.M. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 305: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition to Tat, HIV-1 gp120 protein has been shown to cause reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in glial cells leading to neurodegeneration and apoptosis (10.Israel N. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).

During contact with HIV-infected macrophages or microglia, endothelial cells might contribute to their own damage as a result of the production of ROS (12.Flores S.C. Marecki J.C. Harper K.P.

ROS, including superoxide (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH), and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (NO3-), are biologically active species that are increasingly recognized to play major roles in vascular biology through redox signaling (13.Wu W.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006; 25: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Cytokines could form a pivotal link in ROS-dependent pathways leading to the activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors, such as the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), whose up-regulation determines the specificity of cellular responses to oxidative stress (14.Chin B.Y.

Bertilsson G. Asman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). HIF heterodimers bind to the hypoxia-response element (HRE), a 5′-RCGTG-3′ consensus sequence (19.Schweppe R.E. Cheung T.H. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20993-21003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HIF-1 activation is modulated by TNF-α, ROS, and nitric oxide and/or NO-derived species. ROS contributes to the accumulation and stabilization of HIF-1α (20.Simon M.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 588: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21.Haddad J.J. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2004; 4: 1249-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, TNF-α promotes a signaling cascade, which depends on the translocation of NF-κB and leads to accumulation of HIF-1α protein (22.Zhou J. Schmid T. Brune B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2216-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Finally, HIF-1α is phosphorylated (23.Ke Q. Costa M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). In this regard, HIF-1α has been shown to be a substrate for various protein kinase pathways, including the MAPK pathways. Viral protein R, Vpr is a highly conserved HIV-1 accessory protein, involved in viral replication, transactivation of long terminal repeat (LTR), nuclear localization of the pre-integration complex in nondividing cells, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, and apoptosis (24.Amini S. Khalili K. Sawaya B.E. DNA Cell Biol. 2004; 23: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25.Nitahara-Kasahara Y. Kamata M. Yamamoto T. Zhang X. Miyamoto Y. Muneta K. Iijima S. Yoneda Y.

Vpr causes apoptosis through suppression of NF-κB activity or through rapid dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, through its association with adenine nucleotide translocase leading to the release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase-3 (27.Ayyavoo V.

Med. 2000; 191: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Finally, Vpr was recently shown to cause neuronal death through convergent pathogenic mechanisms with ensuing in vivo neurodegeneration (29.Jones G.J. Barsby N.L. Cohen E.A. Holden J. Harris K. Dickie P. Jhamandas J. Power C. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3703-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have now identified Vpr as one of the HIV-1 proteins involved in triggering free radical production. This occurs via increased production of ROS leading to HIF-1α accumulation in microglia. Accumulation of HIF-1α then up-regulates the HIV-1 promoter. These data reveal a new function for Vpr regarding its ability to induce OS and shed light on the balance that governs the mechanisms used by HIV-1 to activate the OS pathway and its involvement in neuro-AIDS. Plasmids—HIV-1 LTR luciferase reporter plasmid and Vpr expression plasmid were described previously (30.Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Gordon J. Taube R. Amini S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35209-35214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CMV-HIF-1α was a gift from Dr. Steve McKnight (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). The HIF-1α promoter fused to luciferase reporter plasmid was described previously (31.Bonello S. Zähringer C. BelAiba R.S. Djordjevic T. Hess J. Michiels C. Kietzmann T. Görlach A. Arterioscler.

Commun. 1999; 261: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Transduction Assays—The human microglial cell line (33.Janabi N. Peudenier S. Héron B. Ng K.H. Tardieu M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 195: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% FBS. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid (LTR-Luc or HIF-1α-Luc) or co-transfected with 0.5 μg of various expression cDNAs as indicated (34.Mukerjee R. Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Separately, the cells were transduced with adeno-Vpr or adeno-null. The amount of DNA used for each transfection was normalized with pcDNA3 vector plasmid. Each transfection was repeated at least three times with different plasmid preparations. Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed (Promega, Madison, WI). Recombinant Adenoviruses—Vpr cDNA (288 bp) was excised from pcDNA3-Vpr and cloned into the EcoRI and NheI sites of the adenovirus-shuttle plasmid pDC515 under the control of the murine cytomegalovirus promoter (purchased from Microbix Inc., Ontario, Canada). Adeno-Vpr recombinant shuttle containing Vpr sequence (pDC515-Vpr) was transfected into HEK-293 cells with pBHGfrt (del) E1, 3FLP, and a plasmid that provides adenovirus type 5 genome deleted in E1 and E3 genes. Plaques of recombinant adenovirus arising as a result of frt/FLP recombination were isolated, grown, and purified by cesium chloride density equilibrium banding as described previously (35.Eldeen M.B. Deshmane S.L. Simbiri K. Khalili K. Amini S. Sawaya B.E. J. Neuroimmunol. 2006; 176: 174-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Empty shuttle plasmid, pDC515, was used to construct control adenoviral vector (Adeno-null, a virus without a transgene). Adeno-Vpr or adeno-Null was used at an m.o.i. of five plaque-forming units per cell. Hydrogen Peroxide Production Assay—Microglia were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and seeded in 6-well plates. Cells were transduced with adeno-null or adeno-Vpr virus at an m.o.i. of 5 for 48 h. Uninfected cells were also collected as a control. Cells were lysed by the freeze and thaw method three times. Protein was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of protein were used in H2O2 assays with the QuantiChrom™ peroxide assay kit (DIOX-250) from BioAssay Systems. The kit is designed to measure peroxide concentration in biological samples without any pretreatment. The method utilizes the chromogenic Fe3+ xylenol orange reaction, in which a purple complex is formed when Fe2+ provided in the reagent is oxidized to Fe3+ by peroxides present in the sample. The intensity of the color, measured at 540–610 nm, is an accurate measure of peroxide level in the sample. A standard curve was generated as recommended by the manufacturer using known amounts of H2O2 (conversions: 1 μm H2O2 equals 34 ng/ml). Western Blot—Microglia were infected with adeno-null, adeno-Vpr, or adeno-Tat virus at an m.o.i. of 5 at 37 °C. Twenty four hours post-infection, 30 μg of cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-HIF-1α, -Vpr, or anti-Grb2, antibodies using 1/1000 dilution. For HIF-1α detection, two different anti-HIF-1α antibodies were used. The HIF-1α antibodies were purchased either from BD Biosciences or from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Interestingly and according to the manufacturer's catalogue, antibody purchased from BD Biosciences detects two bands of HIF-1α, whereas Abcam antibody detects only one band of HIF-1α. Note that all Western blot assays were performed at least three times. RNA Interference—Transient knockdown of HIF-1α was performed with an HIF-1α-specific siRNA (Dharmacon Research Inc., Lafayette, CO). Twenty four hours after cell plating, microglial cells were rinsed once with Opti-MEM. siRNA was added at a final concentration of 50 nm. Western blot was performed with protein extracts from untransfected cells or cells transfected with HIF-1α-specific siRNA using anti-HIF-1α antibody. For a loading control, anti-Grb2 antibody was used. Control nontargeting siRNA was also used (Dharmacon). Tissue Acquisition—Archival autopsy samples from the frontal lobe of HIV-encephalitis (HIVE) cases and matching normal brain samples have been collected from the Manhattan Brain Bank at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, under Institutional Review Board approval by Temple University Office for Human Subjects Protection. Immunohistochemistry—The tissue, which was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, was sectioned at 5 μm thickness and placed on electromagnetically charged glass slides. Sections were processed for immunohistochemistry as described previously (36.Saunders M. Eldeen M.B. Valle L.D. Reiss K. Peruzzi F. Mameli G. Gelman B.B. Khalili K. Amini S. Sawaya B.E. Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 1419-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody was utilized as primary antibody. After rinsing with PBS, sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, followed by 1 h of incubation with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complexes (ABC Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and developed with diaminobenzidine, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted for histological evaluation. ROS Measurement—The trafficking of 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorodihydrotetramethylfosamine (redox sensor red CC-1; Invitrogen) was used to detect reactive oxygen intermediates (37.Chintapalli J. Yang S. Opawumi D. Goyal S.R. Shamsuddin N. Malhotra A. Reiss K. Meggs L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F523-F530Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Redox Sensor Red CC-1 is oxidized in the presence of O2- and H2O2. Briefly, microglial cells mock-, ad-null-, or adeno-Vpr-infected were loaded at 37 °C for 20 min with 1 μm of Redox Sensor Red CC-1 and a mitochondria-specific dye, MitoTracker Green FM (50 nm; Molecular Probes). Culture slides were washed with PBS and visualized with a Nikon fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E800) equipped with a triple-filter cube and charge-coupled device camera (Nikon DXM1200). Note that all ROS measurement experiments were performed at least three times. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—HeLa 3T1 (HL3T1) cells were grown overnight in 100-mm dishes to 60–70% confluency; cells were then transfected with 50 nm of siRNA-HIF-1α and/or transduced with Ad-Vpr or Ad-Null at an m.o.i. of 5 using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Roche Applied Sciences). Plates were returned to the incubator for 40–48 h. Cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde and harvested, and ChIP was performed. For these studies, only 5 × 106 cells were used per immunoprecipitation reaction because the plasmid is present at a high copy number. The remainder of the procedure followed standard protocols for ChIP analysis, as recommended by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The resulting DNA was analyzed by PCR using the following HIV-LTR primers: coding (-120/+66) 5′-aactggtaccatcgagcttgct-3′ and noncoding (+66/-120) 5′-ttgaggatccagcagtgggttc-3′. Antibody used in the ChIP procedure was against HIF-1α (purchased from BD Biosciences) as well as rabbit anti-mouse IgG. All ChIP assays were performed twice. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was purified using the RNeasy kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) and used for Northern blot analysis as described previously (38.Sweet T. Khalili K. Sawaya B.E. Amini S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For generation of probes for Northern blot analysis, cDNA of human full-length HIF-1α (∼2.48 kb) or 5.8 S rRNA cDNAs was labeled using a random primed labeling reaction with Klenow enzyme and [α-32P]dCTP. The Northern blot experiment was performed three times. HIV-1 Infection—The human U-937 monocytic cell line was maintained in RPMI + 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin-G. Cells in log phase were infected with pNL4-3, pNL4-3 ΔVpr, or JR-FL strains of HIV-1 as follows. Fifty nanograms of p24-containing virus stock were added per 1 × 106 cells. Cells were incubated with virus stock in a small volume of serum-free medium for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and fresh medium containing 2% of FBS was added (500,000 cells/ml). All infection experiments were performed three times. Statistical Analyses—Densitometric analyses were performed using EZQuant-Gel software (EZQuant Biology, Israel). The obtained data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis of parameters was performed using the one-way ANOVA test, followed by the unpaired Student's t test, with p value less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Induction of HIF-1α Protein in the Brain of HIV-1-infected Patients—First, we examined the level of HIF-1α in brain tissue from HIVE patients. Fig. 1A shows white matter of an HIVE case, where numerous reactive astrocytes with enlarged nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm are present (arrows). HIF-1α was found in low levels in the cytoplasm of astrocytes in normal brain, compared with the robust immunolabeling that was observed in the cytoplasm of reactive astrocytes and in macrophages and microglial nodules in HIVE white matter, indicating increased levels of HIF-1α in HIVE. Induction of HIF-1α in HIV-1-infected Microglia—Next, we examined the levels of HIF-1α in HIV-infected microglia. Primary cultures of human microglial cells (1 × 106) were infected with 50 ng (p24) of the JR-FL strain of HIV-1 in 200 μl of serum-free medium for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and maintained in fresh medium containing 2% FBS (500,000 cells/ml). After 5 days, cells were harvested, and total protein extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1B, HIF-1α was induced in HIV-1-infected cells compared with the mock-infected cells. Infection of the cells with HIV-1 was verified, in parallel, by Western blot using anti-Vpr antibody. The levels of the housekeeping protein Grb-2 served as internal controls for equal protein loading. Densitometry was used to quantitate the fold changes in HIF-1α protein prepared from uninfected or infected cells as observed in Fig. 1, B and C. Expression of HIF-1α in the Absence of Vpr in HIV-1-infected Cells—To investigate the importance of Vpr in HIF-1α accumulation during the course of HIV-1 infection, human microglial cells were infected with HIV-1pNL4–3 or HIV-1pNL4–3ΔVpr (HIVΔVpr, where Vpr is deleted) or transfected with pcDNA3-HIF-1α. After 48 h, protein extracts were prepared and analyzed (30 μg of lysate) by Western blot. HIF-1α was induced in HIV-infected or HIF-transfected cells (Fig. 1D, HIF panel, compare lanes 1–3). HIF-1α was weakly induced in cells infected with Vpr-deleted HIV-1 (HIVΔVpr) (Fig. 1D, HIF panel, lane 4), indicating a small role for the other viral proteins, such as Tat, in HIF-1α induction. The efficiency of infection was monitored by Western blot using anti-Vpr antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, Vpr was detected only in extracts from HIV-1-infected cells and not from mock-infected or HIVΔVpr cells (Vpr panel, lane 3). Grb2 levels are shown as a loading control. Note that HIV-1pNL4–3 is a T-cell tropic virus and cannot infect primary microglia. However, our experiment was performed in a microglial cell line, and the ability of HIV-1pNL4–3 to replicate in this particular microglial cell line was confirmed by PCR using several LTR primers (data not shown). Differences in the levels of expression of HIF-1α protein were further evaluated by densitometric analysis using Scion Image software (Scion Image Corp.). As shown in Fig. 1, HIF-1α protein levels increased by almost 3-fold (Fig. 1C) and 2-fold (Fig. 1E) in HIV-infected cells, respectively. Almost no change was observed in the HIF-1α protein levels in cells infected with HIV-1 that lacks Vpr (Fig. 1E, lane 4). Induction of HIF-1α by Adenovirus-Vpr—Next, we examined whether induction of HIF-1α by Vpr is dose-dependent. Microglial cells were infected with different Ad-Vpr concentrations (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 m.o.i.) for 72 h after which the cells were washed and cellular proteins were collected and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A, HIF-1α was induced by Ad-Vpr at an m.o.i. as low as 1 (lane 2). Almost no difference was observed in HIF-1α induction in cells infected with Ad-Vpr at m.o.i. of 5, 10, 15, and 20 (Fig. 2A, compare lane 4 with lanes 5–7). Differences in the levels of expression of HIF-1α protein were further evaluated by densitometric analysis (Fig. 2B). Because Ad-Vpr at an m.o.i. of 5 was enough to induce HIF-1α, it was necessary to examine whether this concentration is physiologically significant. To this end, microglial cells were infected with Ad-Vpr at an m.o.i. of 1 and 5, and Ad-Null at an m.o.i. of 5, whereas U937 cells were infected with JR-FL strain of HIV-1. Cellular proteins were prepared from Ad-null- or Ad-Vpr-infected cells 48 post-infection and were collected 8 days post-infection from U937 cells infected with HIV-1. Thirty micrograms of extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Vpr antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C, the amount of Vpr detected in extracts collected from HIV-1-infected cells was considerably higher than the amount of Vpr detected in cells infected with Ad-Vpr (compare lane 5 to lanes 2 and 3). Vpr was not detected in mock- or Ad-null-infected cells (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 4). Based on these results, we used Ad-Vpr at an m.o.i. of 5 in all experiments. Expression of HIF-1α in the Presence of Tat and Vpr—In light of the previous results showing the ability of Tat and Vpr to induce oxidative stress (6.Price T.O. Uras F. Banks W.A. Ercal N. Exp. Neurol. 2006; 201: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11.Antal J. Pesti M. Folia Microbiol. (Praha.). 2006; 51: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 39.Valcour V.

Synapse. 2006; 59: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of Tat (101 amino acids) and Vpr on HIF-1α expression in microglial cells. Human microglia were transduced with Ad-Tat, Ad-Vpr, or Ad-Null at an m.o.i. of 5. After 48 h, cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blot using anti-HIF-1α antibody (Abcam). Mock-infected cells or cells transfected with pcDNA3 were used as a negative control, whereas pcDNA3-HIF1α-transfected cells were used as a positive control (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 6, respectively). HIF-1α was weakly detected in control cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–3). Infection of cells with Ad-Tat had no significant effect on HIF-1α in microglial cells (Fig. 3A, lane 4), whereas the expression of Vpr significantly increased HIF-1α production (lane 5). Anti-Tat and -Vpr antibodies were used as controls to show expression of both proteins. Anti-Grb2 was used as a control for equal protein loading. Differences in the levels of expression of HIF-1α protein were further evaluated by densitometric analysis (Fig. 3B). Vpr Induces HIF-1α at the Level of Transcription—Induction of HIF-1α by Vpr gave us a rationale to investigate the ability of Vpr to affect expression of HIF-1α at the RNA level. To this end, microglial cells were infected with Ad-null or Ad-Vpr for 48 h at an m.o.i. of 5 after which total RNA was prepared and analyzed by Northern blot using HIF-1α cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 4A, HIF-1α RNA was induced in Vpr-infected cells but not in mock- or Ad-null-infected cells (compare lane 3 with lanes 1 and 2). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as the RNA loading control. Fig. 4B displays the fold changes in mRNA prepared from uninfected or infected cells as indicated. Next, we examined the ability of Vpr to induce the activity of the HIF-1α promoter. As shown in Fig. 4C, infection of microglial cells with Ad-Vpr at an m.o.i. of 5 stimulated the HIF-1α promoter (lane 2). In light of earlier studies suggesting the cooperativity of Vpr with Sp1 and NF-κB (26.Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Mercer W.E. Denisova L. Amini S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2145911009,"The P2X(7) receptor is known for the cytotoxic activity because of its ability to cause opening of non-selective pores in the plasma membrane and activate apoptotic caspases. A key factor of P2X(7)-dependent cytotoxicity is the massive intracellular Ca(2+) increase triggered by its activation. Here we show that P2X(7) transfection increased the ability of the endoplasmic reticulum to accumulate, store, and release Ca(2+). This caused a larger agonist-stimulated increase in cytosol and mitochondrial Ca(2+) in P2X(7) transfectants than in mock transfected cells. P2X(7) transfectants survived and even proliferated in serum-free conditions and were resistant to apoptosis triggered by ceramide, staurosporin, or intracellular Zn(2+) chelation. Finally, the nuclear factor of activated T cells complex 1 (NFATc1) was strongly activated in the P2X(7) transfectants. These observations support our previous finding that the P2X(7) receptor under tonic conditions of stimulation, i.e. those observed in response to basal ATP release, has an anti-apoptotic or even growth promoting rather than cytotoxic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2033077457,"Putative living entities called nanobacteria (NB) are unusual for their small sizes (50–500 nm), pleomorphic nature, and accumulation of hydroxyapatite (HAP), and have been implicated in numerous diseases involving extraskeletal calcification. By adding precipitating ions to cell culture medium containing serum, mineral nanoparticles are generated that are morphologically and chemically identical to the so-called NB. These nanoparticles are shown here to be formed of amorphous mineral complexes containing calcium as well as other ions like carbonate, which then rapidly acquire phosphate, forming HAP. The main constituent proteins of serum-derived NB are albumin, fetuin-A, and apolipoprotein A1, but their involvement appears circumstantial since so-called NB from different body fluids harbor other proteins. Accordingly, by passage through various culture media, the protein composition of these particles can be modulated. Immunoblotting experiments reveal that antibodies deemed specific for NB react in fact with either albumin, fetuin-A, or both, indicating that previous studies using these reagents may have detected these serum proteins from the same as well as different species, with human tissue nanoparticles presumably absorbing bovine serum antigens from the culture medium. Both fetal bovine serum and human serum, used earlier by other investigators as sources of NB, paradoxically inhibit the formation of these entities, and this inhibition is trypsin-sensitive, indicating a role for proteins in this inhibitory process. Fetuin-A, and to a lesser degree albumin, inhibit nanoparticle formation, an inhibition that is overcome with time, ending with formation of the so-called NB. Together, these data demonstrate that NB are most likely formed by calcium or apatite crystallization inhibitors that are somehow overwhelmed by excess calcium or calcium phosphate found in culture medium or in body fluids, thereby becoming seeds for calcification. The structures described earlier as NB may thus represent remnants and by-products of physiological mechanisms used for calcium homeostasis, a concept which explains the vast body of NB literature as well as explains the true origin of NB as lifeless protein-mineralo entities with questionable role in pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2024197752,"Carotenoids are widespread lipophilic pigments synthesized by all photosynthetic organisms and some nonphotosynthetic fungi and bacteria. All carotenoids are derived from the C40 isoprenoid precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and their chemical and physical properties are associated with light absorption, free radical scavenging, and antioxidant activity. Carotenoids are generally synthesized in well defined subcellular organelles, the plastids, which are also present in the phylum Apicomplexa, which comprises a number of important human parasites, such as Plasmodium and Toxoplasma. Recently, it was demonstrated that Toxoplasma gondii synthesizes abscisic acid. We therefore asked if Plasmodium falciparum is also capable of synthesizing carotenoids. Herein, biochemical findings demonstrated the presence of carotenoid biosynthesis in the intraerythrocytic stages of the apicomplexan parasite P. falciparum. Using metabolic labeling with radioisotopes, in vitro inhibition tests with norflurazon, a specific inhibitor of plant carotenoid biosynthesis, the results showed that intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum synthesize carotenoid compounds. A plasmodial enzyme that presented phytoene synthase activity was also identified and characterized. These findings not only contribute to the current understanding of P. falciparum evolution but shed light on a pathway that could serve as a chemotherapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2052219545,"The archaeal ATP synthase is a multisubunit complex that consists of a catalytic A(1) part and a transmembrane, ion translocation domain A(0). The A(1)A(0) complex from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus was isolated. Mass analysis of the complex by laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption (LILBID) indicated a size of 730 +/- 10 kDa. A three-dimensional map was generated by electron microscopy from negatively stained images. The map at a resolution of 2.3 nm shows the A(1) and A(0) domain, connected by a central stalk and two peripheral stalks, one of which is connected to A(0), and both connected to A(1) via prominent knobs. X-ray structures of subunits from related proteins were fitted to the map.

https://openalex.org/W2038789201,"Srv2/cyclase-associated protein is expressed in virtually all plant, animal, and fungal organisms and has a conserved role in promoting actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin-mediated actin turnover. This is achieved by the abilities of Srv2 to recycle cofilin from ADP-actin monomers and to promote nucleotide exchange (ATP for ADP) on actin monomers. Despite this important and universal role in facilitating actin turnover, the mechanism underlying Srv2 function has remained elusive. Previous studies have demonstrated a critical functional role for the G-actin-binding C-terminal half of Srv2. Here we describe an equally important role in vivo for the N-terminal half of Srv2 in driving actin turnover. We pinpoint this activity to a conserved patch of surface residues on the N-terminal dimeric helical folded domain of Srv2, and we show that this functional site interacts with cofilin-actin complexes. Furthermore, we show that this site is essential for Srv2 acceleration of cofilin-mediated actin turnover in vitro. A cognate Srv2-binding site is identified on a conserved surface of cofilin, suggesting that this function likely extends to other organisms. In addition, our analyses reveal that higher order oligomerization of Srv2 depends on its N-terminal predicted coiled coil domain and that oligomerization optimizes Srv2 function in vitro and in vivo. Based on these data, we present a revised model for the mechanism by which Srv2 promotes actin turnover, in which coordinated activities of its N- and C-terminal halves catalyze sequential steps in recycling cofilin and actin monomers."
https://openalex.org/W2019499517,"The close subcellular proximity of different actin filament crosslinking proteins suggests that these proteins may cooperate to organize F-actin structures to drive complex cellular functions during cell adhesion, motility and division. Here we hypothesize that alpha-actinin and filamin, two major F-actin crosslinking proteins that are both present in the lamella of adherent cells, display synergistic mechanical functions.Using quantitative rheology, we find that combining alpha-actinin and filamin is much more effective at producing elastic, solid-like actin filament networks than alpha-actinin and filamin separately. Moreover, F-actin networks assembled in the presence of alpha-actinin and filamin strain-harden more readily than networks in the presence of either alpha-actinin or filamin.These results suggest that cells combine auxiliary proteins with similar ability to crosslink filaments to generate stiff cytoskeletal structures, which are required for the production of internal propulsive forces for cell migration, and that these proteins do not have redundant mechanical functions."
https://openalex.org/W2067337056,"Expression of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in tumors contributes to resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. GGT is inhibited by glutamine analogues that compete with the substrate for the γ-glutamyl binding site. However, the glutamine analogues that have been evaluated in clinical trials are too toxic for use in humans. We have used high throughput screening to evaluate small molecules for their ability to inhibit GGT and have identified a novel class of inhibitors that are not glutamine analogues. These compounds are uncompetitive inhibitors, binding the γ-glutamyl enzyme complex. OU749, the lead compound, has an intrinsic Ki of 17.6 μm. It is a competitive inhibitor of the acceptor glycyl-glycine, which indicates that OU749 occupies the acceptor site while binding to the γ-glutamyl substrate complex. OU749 is more than 150-fold less toxic than the GGT inhibitor acivicin toward dividing cells. Inhibition of GGT by OU749 is species-specific, inhibiting GGT isolated from human kidney with 7–10-fold greater potency than GGT isolated from rat or mouse kidney. OU749 does not inhibit GGT from pig cells. Human GGT expressed in mouse fibroblasts is inhibited by OU749 similarly to GGT from human cells, which indicates that the species specificity is determined by differences in the primary structure of the protein rather than species-specific, post-translational modifications. These studies have identified a novel class of inhibitors of GGT, providing the basis for further development of a new group of therapeutics that inhibit GGT by a mechanism distinct from the toxic glutamine analogues.

The mechanism of inherent and acquired resistance of tumors to many forms of treatment involves glutathione. Elevated glutathione levels in tumors have been shown to contribute to resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy and prevent the initiation of the apoptotic cascade in tumor cells (1Benlloch M.

The enzyme γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT, 2The abbreviations used are: GGT, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase; GpNA, l-glutamic acid γ-4-nitroanilide HCl; glygly, glycyl-glycine; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. EC 2.3.2.2), which is localized to the cell surface, cleaves the γ-glutamyl bond of extracellular glutathione, enabling the cell to use extracellular glutathione as a source of cysteine for increased synthesis of intracellular glutathione (6Hanigan M.H. Ricketts W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6302-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). GGT is induced in many human tumors, enhancing their resistance to chemotherapy (7Hanigan M.H. Frierson Jr., H.F. Swanson P.E. De Young B.R. Hum. Pathol. 1999; 30: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Hanigan M.H. Gallagher B.C. Townsend D.M. Gabarra V. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Inhibiting GGT prior to chemotherapy or radiation would sensitize GGT-positive tumors to treatment. However, all known GGT inhibitors are too toxic for use in humans (9Ahluwalia G.S. Grem J.L. Hao Z. Cooney D.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 46: 243-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Lyons S.D. Sant M.E. Christopherson R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11377-11381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GGT plays an essential role in releasing cysteine from extracellular glutathione. Most cells are unable to take up intact glutathione (6Hanigan M.H. Ricketts W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6302-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In GGT knock-out mice, the absence of GGT in the renal proximal tubules results in the excretion of glutathione in the urine (11Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C. Chevez-Barrios P. Wand Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In these mice, the glutathione in the glomerular filtrate cannot be cleaved into its constituent amino acids for reabsorption. GGT knock-out mice have a 2400-fold elevation of glutathione in their urine relative to their GGT-wild-type littermates. GGT knock-out mice grow slowly and die by 10 weeks of age due to a cysteine deficiency. Inhibiting GGT for as little as 2 h lowers the intracellular cysteine concentration in GGT-positive tumors (3Ruoso P. Hedley D.W. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2004; 54: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of GGT activity could be used prior to the administration of chemotherapy to limit the supply of cysteine to the tumor, thereby blocking the ability of the tumor to maintain high levels of intracellular glutathione. GGT catalyzes the cleavage of γ-glutamyl compounds and the transfer of the γ-glutamyl group to an acceptor substrate by a ping-pong kinetic mechanism (12Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3707-3713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione and glutathione S conjugates are the most common physiologic substrates of GGT. They serve as the γ-glutamyl donor in the initial reaction. In the first reaction, the γ-glutamyl bond of the initial substrate is cleaved, the γ-glutamyl group becomes covalently bound to the enzyme, and the remainder of the substrate is released as the first product. With glutathione as the substrate, cysteinyl-glycine is released and is subsequently cleaved into cysteine and glycine by cell surface dipeptidases. In the second reaction of GGT transpeptidation, the γ-glutamyl group is transferred from the γ-glutamyl-GGT complex to the second substrate (the acceptor). Dipeptides and amino acids have the highest Km as acceptors. The second substrate with the covalently bound γ-glutamyl group is released as the second product from the enzyme. Compounds that inhibit GGT include the glutamine analogues acivicin, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine, and azaserine (Fig. 1) (13Tate S.S. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4806-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Rational design of GGT inhibitors based on studies of the active site has led to the identification of additional γ-glutamyl analogues. Lherbet et al. (14Lherbet C. Gravel C. Keillor J.W. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004; 14: 3451-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Lherbet C. Keillor J.W. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004; 2: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have designed sulfur derivatives of l-glutamic acid that inhibit GGT. Han et al. (16Han L. Hiratake J. Kamiyama A. Sakata K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1432-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Han L. Hiratake J. Tachi N. Suzuki H. Kumagai H. Sakata K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 6043-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have synthesized and tested a series of γ-(monophenyl)phosphono glutamate analogues that also functioned as inhibitors of GGT. Evaluation of several of the glutamine analogues that inhibit GGT has shown them to be toxic (9Ahluwalia G.S. Grem J.L. Hao Z. Cooney D.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 46: 243-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Lyons S.D. Sant M.E. Christopherson R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11377-11381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acivicin, the most potent inhibitor of GGT that has been tested clinically, is a neurotoxin (18Taylor S.A. Crowley J. Pollocck T.W. Eyre H.J. Jaeckle C. Hynes H.E. Stephens R.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 1991; 9: 1476-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The neurotoxicity of the glutamine analogues may be due to interference with glutamine in recycling the neurotransmitter glutamate via the glutamate-glutamine cycle. Glutamine is also involved in the synthesis of several nucleotides and complex polysaccharides. Inhibition of these essential synthetic pathways can be toxic to dividing cells. Acivicin, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine, and azaserine all cause bone marrow suppression (9Ahluwalia G.S. Grem J.L. Hao Z. Cooney D.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 46: 243-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). There is no known GGT inhibitor that can be used clinically. Rather than design glutamine analogues, we have used physiologic conditions to screen libraries of small molecules to identify new inhibitors of GGT. This effort has lead to the identification of a novel class of uncompetitive inhibitors of GGT that are structurally distinct from and less toxic than the glutamine analogues. This new class of compounds occupies the acceptor site, not the γ-glutamyl site. The lead compound is species-specific, inhibiting human GGT, but with weak to no inhibitory activity toward GGT from mice, rats, and pigs. High Throughput Screening-A high throughput method was developed to screen for inhibitors of GGT. The assays were conducted in 96-well plates. The final volume in each well was 100 μl. The assay buffer contained: 100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, with 3.2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 27.5 mm NaCl. Each reaction contained 1 mm l-glutamic acid γ-4-nitroanilide HCl (GpNA) and 40 mm glycyl-glycine (glygly) (19Orlowski M. Meister A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GGT is expressed on the cell surface, and the assay was initiated by the addition of 104 786-O cells (ATCC CRL-1932, a GGT-positive human renal cell adenocarcinoma line). Formation of the product, p-nitroaniline, at 37 °C was monitored continuously at A405 by a Bio-Rad model 680 microplate reader with Microplate Manager 5.2 software (Bio-Rad). One unit of GGT activity was defined as the amount of GGT that released 1 μmol of p-nitroaniline/min at 37 °C. Screening Chemical Library-A 10,000 compound chemical library from the DIVERSet collection (ChemBridge Corp., San Diego, CA) was screened for inhibitors of GGT. The library was formatted in 96-well plates with 0.25 μmol of test compound per well. Stock solutions were prepared by the addition of 25 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) per well. For each test compound, 5 μl were added to the assay mixture, resulting in a final concentration of 500 μm. Glutathione is a competitive inhibitor of the GpNA substrate, and wells containing 400 μm oxidized glutathione were included on each 96-well plate as a positive control. Compounds that inhibited GGT activity to the same extent or greater than glutathione were scored as positive hits. The positive hits were retested at several concentrations for inhibition of GGT activity. For further testing, individual compounds and their structural analogues were purchased from ChemBridge, Specs (Delft, Netherlands), or Otava Chemicals (Kiev, Ukraine). Enzyme Isolation-GGT was isolated from human kidney (National Disease Research Interchange, Philadelphia, PA), male Sprague-Dawley rat kidney and female BALB/c mouse kidney. Tissue was homogenized in 4 volumes of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.33 m sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1.4 μg/ml aprotinin. A 9000 × g supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The microsomal pellet was homogenized in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.35, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μm leupeptin, 1.4 μg/ml aprotinin and then centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was assayed for GGT activity, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C until further use. All solutions were maintained at 4 °C throughout the isolation. The specific activities of GGT were 3.4, 7.4, and 1.5 units/mg of protein for human, rat, and mouse preparations, respectively. Prior to use in the GGT assay, the enzyme was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.025% Triton X-100, and 0.19 milliunits of enzyme were used per assay unless otherwise indicated. Cloning of Human GGT and Expression in Pichia pastoris-The soluble domain of human GGT (amino acids 28–569) was amplified by PCR. The forward primer introduced an EcoRI restriction site and a tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable N-terminal His6 tag, whereas the reverse primer introduced a NotI restriction site after the stop codon of genomic GGT. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NotI and inserted into the corresponding sites of pPICZαA (Invitrogen), generating plasmid pMW-102. This construct was amplified in Escherichia coli DH5α cells. The fidelity of the recombinant open reading frame was verified by sequencing (the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, DNA Sequencing Core Facility, Oklahoma City, OK). The SacI-linearized plasmid, pMW-102, was purified and transformed into wild-type P. pastoris strain X-33, selected, and induced as recommended by Invitrogen. Secreted, recombinant, His6-tagged, human GGT was collected from the media with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The hexahistidine tag was cleaved with His6-tagged tobacco etch virus protease. Tobacco etch virus protease and the cleaved histidine tag were separated from human GGT by collecting the flow-through from a second nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column purification. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 397.8 units/mg. Prior to use in the GGT assay, the enzyme was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, and 2.8 milliunits of enzyme were used per assay. Kinetic Studies-The assay buffer contained: 100 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, with 3.2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, and 27.5 mm NaCl. The concentrations of the substrate GpNA and the acceptor glygly were varied as indicated. Purified GGT was added to initiate the assay. The reaction was monitored as described for the high throughput screening. Cytotoxicity Assays-786-O (ATCC CRL-1932), a human renal cell adenocarcinoma line, was plated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (50 units/ml, 50 μg/ml) at 103 cells/well in 96-well plates. The next day, the medium was changed to fresh DMEM containing fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and the test compound. Equivalent concentrations of DMSO were added to control wells. Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay 72 h after the addition of the test compound (20Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Cell Lines-LLC-PK1 (ATCC CRL-1392), a pig kidney cell line, NRK-52E (ATCC CRL-1571), a normal rat kidney cell line, LLC-MK2 (ATCC CCL-7), a normal kidney monkey cell line, and 786-O cells were grown in complete DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and penicillin/streptomycin (50 units/ml, 50 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). NIH/3T3 cells transfected with cDNA encoding human GGT were described previously and were grown in DMEM/F12 containing 200 μg/ml G418 (6Hanigan M.H. Ricketts W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6302-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). HK-2 (ATCC CRL-2190), a human cell line derived from immortalized normal proximal tubule cells, were grown in keratinocyte serum-free medium from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were trypsinized off the plates and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline for the GGT assay. Glutathione Degradation-Incubation mixture contained 1 mm glutathione, 40 mm glygly, and inhibitor in the GGT assay buffer. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 1.9 milliunits of GGT and incubated at 37 °C. The final volume of the reaction was 100 μl. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed at the specified time points, immediately acidified with an equal volume of cold 4.31% 5-sulfosalicylic acid, and maintained at 4 °C until the glutathione concentration was determined by the method of Tietze (21Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5556) Google Scholar). Data Analysis-Initial velocity data were first analyzed graphically using double reciprocal plots of initial velocities versus substrate concentration and suitable secondary plots. Data were then fitted using the appropriate equation and the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm supplied with the EnzFitter program from BIOSOFT (Cambridge, UK). Kinetic parameters and their corresponding standard errors were estimated using a simple weighting method. Data for competitive and uncompetitive inhibition were fitted using Equations 1 and 2.v=VAKa(1+Kis)+AEq. 1 v=VAKa+A(1+Kii)Eq. 2 In Equations 1 and 2, v and V are the measured initial rate and maximum rate, respectively, Ka is the Michaelis constant for the varied substrate, and Kis and Kii are slope and intercept inhibition constants. The LD50 and 95% confidence intervals of the test compounds in cell lines were calculated with a Prism log (inhibitor) versus normalized response (variable slope) curve fit (Prism, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). A two-tailed t test was used to detect significant differences between OU749 inhibition of human GGT and inhibition of GGT from other species. Screening Chemical Library for Inhibitors of GGT-A 10,000-compound chemical diversity library from ChemBridge Corp. was screened for inhibitors of GGT activity. Compounds in the DIVERSet library were chosen for maximum diversity of chemical structure. All compounds satisfied several physiochemical properties important for drug discovery: molecular weight ≤ 500, clogP ≤ 5, tPSA ≤ 100, rotatable bonds ≤ 8, hydrogen bond acceptors ≤ 10, and hydrogen bond donors ≤ 5 (22Lipinski C.A. Lombardo F. Dominy B.W. Feeney P.J. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 46: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8716) Google Scholar). The initial screen identified 16 hits. When retested, 12 of the compounds were only weak inhibitors and not pursued further. Three of the remaining compounds were derivatives of isoindole-1,3-dione. Additional evaluation of this group of compounds revealed low solubility in aqueous solution and severe toxicity in a cell-based assay. These compounds were not pursued further. The last of the initial hits was a novel inhibitor of GGT. The inhibitor, N-[5-(4-methoxybenzyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]benzenesulfonamide, was designated OU749. The structure of OU749 reveals that it is not a glutamine analogue (Fig. 2). It inhibited GGT isolated from human kidney in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Kinetic Analysis of Inhibition of GGT by OU749-To determine the mechanism of OU749 inhibition of human kidney GGT, inhibition patterns were obtained varying each of the substrates with the second maintained at a fixed concentration. With GpNA (the first substrate) varied, glygly was maintained at 40 mm (Kglygly is 11.4 ± 1.2 mm), whereas GpNA was maintained at 3 mm (KGpNA is 1.07 ± 0.04 mm) when glygly was varied. Inhibition by OU749 was uncompetitive with respect to GpNA, indicating that it binds to the covalent E-γ-glutamyl complex, the F form of the enzyme (Fig. 3A). The Ki value obtained was 73.8 ± 2.5 μm. Inhibition by OU749 was competitive with respect to glygly, indicating that OU749 was occupying the acceptor site (Fig. 3B). A Ki of 17.6 ± 3.8 μm was obtained. The Ki of 17.6 μm is the intrinsic value (23Cook P.F. Cleland W.W. Enzyme Kinetics and Mechanisms. Garland Press, London2007Crossref Google Scholar). The value obtained varying GpNA at a fixed glygly concentration must be the same once corrected for the concentration of fixed reactant. Given appKi = Ki(1 + [glygly]/Kglygly), the calculated value of Ki is 16.5 μm. A similar analysis of OU749 inhibition, carried out with a highly purified preparation of human GGT expressed in yeast, yielded similar results (Fig. 3, C and D). The appKi of OU749 as a competitive inhibitor of glygly was 25 ± 2 μm, whereas that obtained varying GpNA was 58.2 ± 1.6 μm. A fit of the data displayed in Fig. 3, A–D, to the equation for noncompetitive inhibition (v = VA/[Ka(1 + I/Kis) + A(1 + I/Kii)]) does give a finite but very high Ki (>200 μm) binding to the free form of the enzyme (E form). This is not surprising because the site for glygly, and thus OU749, must be present in the E form. However, the much weaker binding, >10-fold, is consistent with synergy of binding of OU749 in the presence of the γ-glutamyl moiety. Structure Activity Studies-A series of structural analogues of OU749 was evaluated as inhibitors of GGT. The appKi for each compound, obtained by varying GpNA, was determined experimentally with GGT isolated from human kidney. Compounds that had no inhibitory activity aided in defining elements that were essential for inhibition (Fig. 4). The data revealed that inhibition of GGT activity required the benzene ring attached to the sulfonamide group (Fig. 4, compound 1). The addition of a spacer carbon atom between the sulfur and the benzene ring eliminated inhibitory activity (Fig. 4, compound 2). Removing the carbon spacer atom between the thiadiazole ring and the end ring (Fig. 4, compound 3) or substitution of the thiadiazole ring with more complex structures eliminated inhibitory activity (Fig. 4, compounds 4 and 5). A core structure containing all the essential elements is shown in Fig. 5. The Ki for the unsubstituted core structure is 99.7 ± 3.1 μm. Inhibition is enhanced by the substitution of either the X or the Y position with chlorine (Fig. 5, compounds 2 and 4). Substitution of both the X and the Y position with chlorine provides the most potent inhibitor with an αKi of 28.7 ± 1.0 μm (Fig. 5, compound 1). The addition of a methoxy group at the Y position of the core compound yields our lead compound OU749, which is the third most potent inhibitor of the analogues tested (Fig. 5, compound 3). Substitution of the X position with either a methoxy compound or a nitroso group weakened the inhibition (Fig. 5, compounds 5 and 7–9). The addition of an acetamide group at the X position eliminates inhibition (Fig. 5, compound 10).FIGURE 5Inhibition of GGT by structural analogues of OU749.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Toxicity of OU749-The glutamine analogues that inhibit GGT activity are toxic to dividing cells. We evaluated the toxicity of OU749 and several of its structural analogues toward cells in log growth using 786-O cells, a human renal tumor cell line. Cells were grown in the presence of the test compounds for 3 days. As shown in Table 1, the glutamine analogue, acivicin, had an LD50 of 0.81 μm. All four of the compounds tested (Fig. 5, compounds 1–3 and 6) were at least an order of magnitude less toxic than acivicin. OU749 (compound 3) was more than 150-fold less toxic than acivicin. These data emphasize the reduced toxicity of GGT inhibitors that are not glutamine analogues.TABLE 1Toxicity of GGT inhibitors toward dividing 786-O cellsCompoundLD50μMAcivicin0.81Fig. 5 compound 17.6Fig. 5 compound 26.5Fig. 5 compound 3 (OU749)128Fig. 5 compound 671 Open table in a new tab Although our structure activity analysis revealed two compounds that were more potent inhibitors of GGT than OU749 (Fig. 5, compounds 1 and 2), these compounds were 17–20-fold more toxic than OU749, making them less promising as candidates for further development for clinical use. Therefore OU749 continued as our lead compound in further characterization studies of inhibition by this class of compounds. Species Specificity of GGT Inhibition by OU749-OU749 inhibits GGT isolated from human kidney in a dose-dependent manner. However, OU749 is 7-fold less potent as an inhibitor of GGT isolated from rat kidney and 10-fold less potent inhibiting GGT from mouse kidney (Fig. 6A). The species specificity of GGT inhibition by OU749 was further evaluated with cells lines from five different species (Fig. 6B). OU749 showed dose-dependent inhibition of GGT in the two human kidney cell lines, 786-O a renal tumor cell line and HK-2, an immortalized renal proximal tubule cell line. Inhibition of GGT in the human cell lines was of similar potency to the inhibition of GGT isolated from human kidney. GGT in the rat kidney cell line NRK-52E was only weakly inhibited by OU749, equivalent to the weak inhibition of GGT isolated from rat kidney. GGT in the pig kidney cell line LLC-PK1 was not inhibited by OU749. GGT in the monkey kidney cell line LLC-MK2 was only weakly inhibited by OU749, similar to the inhibition of GGT in rat kidney cells. GGT is heavily glycosylated (24Yamashita K. Hitoi A. Matsuda Y. Miura T. Katunuma N. Kobata A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether the sensitivity of GGT to inhibition by OU749 was determined by the primary structure or by post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, we tested the sensitivity of human GGT expressed in mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts to inhibition by OU749 (Fig. 6B). The data revealed that human GGT expressed in mouse cells was inhibited by OU749 to the same extent as human GGT expressed in other human cells. Therefore the sensitivity of GGT to inhibition by OU749 was determined by the peptide sequence rather than species-specific post-translational modifications. Data in Fig. 2 further confirm that the primary structure rather than post-translational modifications determine the degree of inhibition of GGT by OU749. GGT isolated from human kidney (Fig. 2, A and B) is inhibited by OU749 to the same extent as human GGT expressed in yeast (Fig. 2, C and D). OU749 Inhibits the Cleavage of Glutathione by GGT-The standard assay for GGT activity monitors the release of p-nitroaniline from the first substrate, γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide. To confirm that OU749 inhibits the cleavage of glutathione, the primary physiologic substrate of GGT, we monitored the breakdown of glutathione by human kidney GGT in the presence of the inhibitor. OU749 inhibited the cleavage of glutathione in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). OU749 also inhibited the cleavage of oxidized glutathione by human GGT (data not shown). To determine whether the species specificity of inhibition of GGT by OU749 was also relevant to the physiologic substrate, OU749 was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the degradation of glutathione by rat GGT. Rat GGT cleaved glutathione in a time-dependent fashion, as had been observed for human GGT (Fig. 7B). OU749 was unable to inhibit degradation of glutathione by GGT from rat kidney (Fig. 7B). These data corroborate the data regarding the species specificity of OU749 obtained using the synthetic substrate, GpNA. We have identified a novel class of GGT inhibitors that are not glutamine analogues. Kinetic studies of the lead compound OU749 revealed that the mechanism of inhibition was uncompetitive relative to the γ-glutamyl substrate, indicating that the inhibitor bound the enzyme-substrate complex. In contrast to competitive inhibitors, which lose potency as substrate concentration builds, uncompetitive inhibitors become more potent as the substrate concentration rises in an inhibited open system. Data from the GGT knock-out mice show that in the absence of GGT activity, glutathione levels decrease in tissues, but the concentration of glutathione in the serum rises more than 6-fold, likely due to the inability of cells to cleave glutathione and recover the amino acids (11Lieberman M.W. Wiseman A.L. Shi Z. Carter B.Z. Barrios R. Ou C. Chevez-Barrios P. Wand Y. Habib G.M. Goodman J.C. Huang S.L. Lebovitz R.M. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7923-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, the glutathione concentration in the urine increases more than 2400-fold as the glutathione transits the proximal tubules intact in the absence of GGT. Westley and Westley (25Westley A.M. Westley J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5347-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have argued that uncompetitive inhibitors are superior to competitive inhibitors for instituting change in open systems such as those found in vivo where substrate concentrations rise with enzyme inhibition. Many uncompetitive inhibitors function by locking the enzyme-substrate complex in form after initial product release but before conversion of the enzyme back to the native form. In GGT, the enzyme-substrate complex consists of the glutamyl group covalently bound to the enzyme following release of the remainder of the γ-glutamyl substrate. GGT from E. coli has been crystallized (26Kumagai H. Nohara S. Suzuki H. Hashimoto W. Yamamoto K. Sakai H. Sakabe K. Fukuyama K. Sakabe N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of E. coli GGT and the γ-glutamyl-enzyme intermediate revealed that the N-terminal threonine of the small subunit is the catalytic nucleophile in the enzymatic reaction (27Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This threonine is conserved in human, rat, mouse, and pig. Site-directed mutagenesis of human GGT has identified four amino acids that are essential to GGT activity (one in the large subunit, Arg 107, and three in the small subunit, Asp-423, Ser-451, and Ser-452) (28Ikeda Y. Fujii J. Anderson M.E. Taniguchi N. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22223-22228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Ikeda Y. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Meister A. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3980-3985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All four of these amino acids are identical in human, rat, mouse, and pig. Kinetic studies further revealed that while binding the enzyme-γ-glutamyl complex, OU749 occupies the acceptor site. The acceptor site is not well defined. To date, only the crystal structures of GGT isolated from E. coli and Helicobacter pylori have been published (27Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Morrow A.L. Williams K. Sand A. Boanca G. Barycki J.J.

Chem. 2007; 282: 534-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). No information on mutational analysis that alters the acceptor site has been published. Our finding that inhibition by OU749 is species-specific with high affinity for human, lower affinity for monkey, rat, and mouse, and no inhibition of pig GGT may aid in the delineation of the acceptor site. The sequence of GGT from human, rat, mouse, and pig have been published. Alignment of these sequences is included in the supplemental data. However, no pattern is apparent in the sequence alignment that would provide insight into the amino acids or regions of the polypeptide sequence that are critical to inhibitor binding. Alignment of the GGT peptide sequences does reveal that one of the seven potential N-glycosylation sites in human GGT (Asn-266) is not present in rat, mouse, or pig. Modeling the mammalian sequences based on the crystal structure of the bacterial enzyme does not highlight any of the amino acids as important in inhibitor binding. There are no other reports of species-specific inhibitors of GGT, although the effect of sulfhydral reagents on GGT activity appears to have some species specificity (33Allison R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 419-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Structural alterations of OU749 increased the inhibitory activity of the compound but not without accompanying increases in toxicity. The in vitro toxicity profile of OU749 is favorable. In a dividing cell model, OU749 is 150-fold less toxic than acivicin, which was abandoned after phase I clinical trials due to toxicity. In addition to its role in cancer therapy, GGT also plays a critical role in drug metabolism due to the ubiquitous presence of glutathione. GGT is an essential enzyme in the formation of mercapturic acids in the kidney and initiates the activation of halogenated alkenes and other drugs to potent kidney toxins through this pathway (34Anders M.W. Dekant W. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 501-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 35Bai F. Jones D.C. Lau S.S. Monks T.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cisplatin has been shown to be bioactivated to a renal toxin through the mercapturic acid pathway (36Hanigan M.H. Gallagher B.C. Taylor Jr., P.T. Large M.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5925-5929PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hanigan M.H. Lykissa E.D. Townsend D.M. Ou C.N. Barrios R. Lieberman M.W. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1889-1894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Inhibition of GGT during cisplatin-based chemotherapy would not only sensitize the tumors to the therapy, it would also block the kidney toxicity of cisplatin. Additional clinical conditions for which a GGT inhibitor may have therapeutic benefit include cardiovascular disease and asthma as nitric oxide is transported in the blood as a glutathione conjugate and requires GGT activity for its release (38Henson S.E. Nichols T.C. Holers V.M. Karp D.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1845-1852PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lipton A.J. Johnson M.A. Macdonald T. Lieberman M.W. Gozal D. Gaston B. Nature. 2001; 413: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Finally, GGT is one of two enzymes that metabolize leukotriene C4 to leukotriene D4, a mediator of inflammation common to many diseases (40Carter B.Z. Wiseman A.L. Orkiszewski R. Ballard K.D. Ou C.N. Lieberman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12305-12310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previous clinical studies have attempted to overcome drug resistance in tumors by inhibiting glutathione synthesis with buthionine sulfoximine (41O’Dwyer P.J. Hamilton T.C. Young R.C. LaCreta F.P. Carp N. Tew K.D. Padavic K. Comis L. Ozols R.F. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of glutathione. However, there was no depletion of cysteine in the body with this protocol. The sulfur of cysteine, the active nucleophilic group of the glutathione molecule, binds and inactivates reactive, electrophilic compounds. Free cysteine will also react with, and inactivate, chemotherapy drugs (42Bose R.N. Ghosh S.K. Moghaddas S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 65: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Inhibition of GGT both reduces intracellular glutathione and depletes cysteine levels, increasing the sensitivity of the tumor to the drug. Studies in mice have shown that inhibiting GGT for as little as 2 h selectively lowers the intracellular cysteine concentration in GGT-positive tumors (3Ruoso P. Hedley D.W. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2004; 54: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mena et al. (4Mena S. Benlloch M. Ortega A. Carretero J. Obrador E. Asensi M. Petschen I. Brown B.D. Estrela J.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 2658-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) used acivicin to deplete tumor glutathione in combination with aggressive therapy and achieved complete cure of metastatic melanoma to the liver in 90% of test animals. Development of less toxic GGT inhibitors, such as OU749, holds great promise for enhanced cancer therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2137445394,"The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is involved in regulation of bile acid and lipid metabolism. Recently, a role for FXR in control of glucose metabolism became evident. Because FXR is expressed along the length of the small intestine, we evaluated the potential role of FXR in glucose absorption and processing. During intravenous infusion of a trace amount of d-[6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose, a d-[U-(13)C]glucose-enriched oral glucose bolus was given, and glucose kinetics were determined in wild-type and Fxr(-/-) mice. Compared with wild-type mice, Fxr(-/-) mice showed a delayed plasma appearance of orally administered glucose. Multicompartmental kinetic modeling revealed that this delay was caused by an increased flux through the glucose 6-phosphate pool in enterocytes. Thus, our results show involvement of FXR in intestinal glucose absorption, representing a novel physiological function for this nuclear receptor."

However, elevated expression of the Hyal1 isozyme accelerates tumor growth and metastatic progression. In this study, we used structural information, site-directed mutagenesis, and steady state enzyme kinetics to probe molecular determinants of human Hyal1 function. Mutagenesis of active site residues Glu131 and Tyr247 to Gln and Phe, respectively, eliminated activity at all hyaluronan concentrations (to 125 μm or 2.5 mg/ml). Conservative mutagenesis of Asp129 and Tyr202 significantly impaired catalysis by increases of 5- and 10-fold in apparent Km and reductions in Vmax of 95 and 50%, respectively. Tyr247 and Asp129 are required for stabilization of the catalytic nucleophile, which arises as a resonance intermediate of N-acetylglucosamine on the substrate. Glu131 is a likely proton donor for the hydroxyl leaving group. Tyr202 is a substrate binding determinant. General disulfide reduction had no effect on activity in solution, but enzymatic deglycosylation reduced Hyal1 activity in a time-dependent fashion. Mutagenesis identified Asn350 glycosylation as the requisite modification. Deletion of the C-terminal epidermal growth factor-like domain, in which Asn350 is located, also eliminated activity, irrespective of glycosylation.

Depending on the organism, there may be one or several isozymes (3Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In humans, five isozymes have been identified and characterized to varying extents for tissue and cellular distribution, activity profile, substrate specificity and function. Hyaluronidases have been termed spreading factors because of their potential to accelerate the spread of toxic venom effects from bees and snakes (4Markovic-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L.

Loss of hyaluronidase expression in humans is implicated in dysregulated extracellular matrix turnover and correlates with a type of lysosomal storage disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis IX (5Triggs-Raine B.

Because the hyaluronidase expression level and/or activation state is thought to determine whether its effect is to promote or suppress these processes (14Lokeshwar V.B. Cerwinka W.H. Isoyama T. Lokeshwar B.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7782-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it is critical to gain a thorough understanding of the molecular determinants of its enzymatic activity. Human hyaluronidases are glycoside hydrolase enzymes (Family 56 as described by the carbohydrate-active enzymes data base at www.cazy.org (15Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.

Members of this family are endoglycosidases, with homology to chitinases and lysozyme (18Drouillard S. Armand S. Davies G.J. Vorgias C.E. Henrissat B. Biochem.

Much of the proposed scheme has been tested in related enzymes, the chitinases (17Rye C.S. Withers S.G. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15619-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), because no molecular characterizations of Hyal1 have been performed. Briefly, in the resting state at its optimal pH of 4.0, aspartate 129 and glutamate 131 essentially share a proton. Catalysis is thought to require initiation by intramolecular resonance of the amide bond of N-acetylglucosamine in the bound HA polymer. The transition state briefly acquires a positive charge on the nitrogen, whereas the carbonyl becomes an oxyanion nucleophile positioned to attack the electrophilic anomeric carbon of the same N-acetylglucosamine unit. As this intramolecular attack occurs, a five-membered ring forms, driving out the C4 hydroxyl of the departing, newly cleaved portion of the chain, which is protonated by Glu131. Transition state formation is stabilized by the negative charge on Asp129 that is positioned in hydrogen bond distance to the positively charged substrate nitrogen as Glu131 transfers its proton to the leaving group. Glu131, thus deprotonated, serves to activate an incoming water molecule for hydrolysis of the intramolecular intermediate to restore N-acetylglucosamine. Support for this mechanism derives from the observation that allosamidin, an oligosaccharide that terminates in a five-membered ring structure, is an effective competitive inhibitor of the closely related chitinase family (21Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Armand S. Kalk K.H. Isogai A. Henrissat B. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15619-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which cleaves poly-N-acetylglucosamine and shows conservation of several key active site residues, including the aspartate and glutamate. Retention of configuration at the anomeric carbon has been shown for a related bacterial N-acetylglucosaminidase enzyme (18Drouillard S. Armand S. Davies G.J. Vorgias C.E. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and serves to support existence of an intramolecular transition state. Also available is a crystal structure of a distantly homologous bacterial hyaluronan lyase with bound ascorbate, a potent five-membered ring-containing inhibitor of both bacterial lyases and human hyaluronidases (24Hofinger E.S.

Superposition of available crystal coordinates for a HA tetrameric substrate bound to the bee venom hyaluronidase (4Markovic-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Muller U. Schirmer T.

We used this structural information, in conjunction with sequence alignments and comparisons to the bee venom hyaluronidase structure, to identify putative active site residues and other structural contributors. A steady state kinetic assay allowed us to quantitatively assess the effects of site-directed mutagenesis, disulfide reduction, and N-glycoside removal.

Sodium hyaluronate (20 kDa) was from Lifecore Biomedical Inc. (Chaska, MN). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Transient transfection of 22Rv1 and HEK293 cells used the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and calcium phosphate precipitation methods, respectively.

Biocomput. 1996; 1: 724Google Scholar). To facilitate selection of residues specifically involved in catalysis, the active site of a modeled complex with a HA tetrasaccharide was centered upon as depicted in Fig. 1. Side chains with potential for chemical reactivity within 5 Å of the cleaved HA glycoside were identified, as well as several additional residues that lined the groove possibly accommodating the full substrate. Conservation across human, bovine, murine, and bee species in sequence alignments of all hyaluronidase isozymes was used as an additional criterion to refine our choice of putative catalytic, substrate binding and structural residues. Upon determining that removal of N-glycosides negatively impacted activity, we additionally identified three putative N-glycosylation sites by primary sequence analysis using NetNGlyc (30Blom N. Sicheritz-Ponten T. Gupta R. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1633-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar), which are largely conserved among human hyaluronidases but not broadly across species. The side chains for residues examined in the study were colored by atom.

The preprotrypsin signal peptide ensured abundant soluble FLAG-tagged Hyal1 secretion to the conditioned cell culture media of transfectants. Point mutants of Hyal1 were generated from the wild-type pFlag-Hyal1 construct using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primer sequences used to create the wild-type construct and specific point mutations are given in supplemental Table S1 (affected codons are highlighted). Coding sequences for D129N, E131Q, Y202F, N216A, S245A, Y247F, and R265L, N350A, N350tr, and L356tr were verified by the Genomics Core at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. For initial activity measurements, recombinant plasmids encoding N-terminal FLAG epitope fusions to Hyal1 and the point mutants were used to transfect human 22Rv1 prostate carcinoma cells with FuGENE 6. After 48 h in RPMI containing 1% serum, conditioned media were collected and concentrated 10-fold using Centriplus YM-10 microconcentrators. Protease inhibitor mixture was added to the final concentrated supernatant. Soluble expression of wild-type and mutant Hyal1 was verified by Western analysis with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Wild-type and mutant protein used for measurement of kinetic constants and evaluation of post-translational modifications was purified from conditioned media of HEK293 transfectants, with the exception of the N350A, N350tr, and L356tr mutants, which were purified from the soluble fraction of HEK293 cell lysates. Media were harvested 48 h after calcium phosphate transfection, concentrated at least 10-fold, and dialyzed exhaustively against 1× Tris-buffered saline before applying to anti-FLAG affinity resin. After washing with 10 column volumes of Tris-buffered saline, Hyal1-FLAG was eluted from the column with FLAG peptide and dialyzed against hyaluronidase assay buffer (50 mm sodium formate, pH 4.0, 150 mm NaCl). Folded structure of mutants that lacked activity was implied by soluble secretion, but also by their intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence profiles (31Prasad A.R. Nishimura J.S. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4272-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which were identical to those of wild-type Hyal1, and red-shifted comparably upon denaturation with 3 m guanidine-HCl (supplemental Fig. S1). Evaluation of Post-translational Modifications-To evaluate the importance of disulfides, purified Hyal1 was incubated in the absence or presence of 1, 10, or 50 mm DTT, or 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, for 1 h at 37 °C prior to activity analysis. The importance of N-glycosides to Hyal1 activity was examined by enzymatic removal. Purified Hyal1 (16 μg) was incubated with 10 units of PNGase F, which is specific for protein N-glycoside digestion, in the vendor’s recommended buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40) for the indicated times prior to Western blot and kinetic assay. Hyaluronidase Activity Assays-Hyal1 activity was measured by one of three methods. Substrate gel electrophoresis was performed essentially as previously described (32Lokeshwar V.B. Lokeshwar B.L. Pham H.T. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 651-657PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrated conditioned media were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.2 mg/ml HA. After a 1-h renaturation in 3% Triton X-100, gels were incubated in hyaluronidase assay buffer at 37 °C overnight, stained with 0.5% Alcian blue for at least 2 h, and destained with 7% acetic acid. Initial quantitative comparisons of wild-type and mutant Hyal1 activity were done in an HA-coated microplate assay (13Simpson M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Lokeshwar V.B. Lokeshwar B.L. Pham H.T. Block N.L.

Briefly, serial dilutions of concentrated conditioned media adjusted for equal Hyal1 content were applied in triplicate to 96-well plates that had been precoated overnight at 4 °C in a solution of 50 μg/ml human umbilical cord HA (200 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6), and blocked with Pierce Superblock reagent. After a 1-h incubation in hyaluronidase assay buffer, wells were washed and residual HA was detected by biotinylated HABP, detected with avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase and tetramethylbenzidine substrate. Absorbance at 650 nm was used to interpolate specific activity from a concurrent Streptomyces hyaluronidase standard curve. Activity of wild-type and all mutant Hyal1 species was assayed as previously described by Reissig et al. (36Reissig J.L. Storminger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified enzyme (0.5 μg) was incubated with increasing concentrations of HA (20 kDa) in hyaluronidase assay buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The reaction was heat inactivated (100 °C for 5 min). Cleaved ends were quantified by the Morgan-Elson color reaction (potassium tetrahydroborate and acidified dimethylamino benzaldehyde) and absorbance at 585 nm. Molar quantity of N-acetylglucosamine reducing ends in each sample was interpolated from a concurrently developed standard of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. An initial time course revealed linear kinetics for wild-type Hyal1 from 10 to 90 min, so a time point of 60 min was chosen for all subsequent assays. Michaelis constants (Km and Vmax) were determined for Hyal1 species that exhibited saturable kinetics by fitting data to a model of single site association using Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). Heterogeneous viscosity of the HA solutions increased above 125 μm (2.5 mg/ml), so this was the maximum concentration assayed. Thus, Km and Vmax values were extrapolated from the curve fit where indicated. Examination of the Hyal1 Active Site-Our goal in this study was to probe the molecular interactions that specify hyaluronidase activity of human Hyal1. To obtain sufficient protein quantities, we overexpressed the enzyme as a secreted N-terminal FLAG epitope fusion. Because a significant aspect of research on Hyal1 is focused in the context of human cancer, we initially used 22Rv1, a human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line model for prostate cancer progression, as the host line for protein production. These cells normally produce little active hyaluronidase (13Simpson M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and overexpression of Hyal1 was found to accelerate their growth in culture as well as their metastatic dissemination to lymph nodes in mouse orthotopic tumor models (6Kovar J.L. Johnson M.A. Volcheck W.M. Chen J. Simpson M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 169: 1415-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 37Bharadwaj A.G. Kovar J.L. Loughman E. Elowsky C. Oakley G.G. Simpson M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 1027-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Abundant soluble FLAG-tagged Hyal1 was secreted to the conditioned cell culture media of transfectants. The first round of mutagenesis was directed at characterization of the putative enzyme active site. Using crystal coordinates for the bee venom hyaluronidase complexed with HA (4Markovic-Housley Z. Miglierini G. Soldatova L. Rizkallah P.J. Muller U. Schirmer T. Structure. 2000; 8: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), in conjunction with human apo-Hyal1 coordinates (27Chao K.L. Muthukumar L. Herzberg O. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6911-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we depicted the human enzyme bound to a tetrasaccharide substrate, and inspected the architecture of the active site (Fig. 1). Based on this model, we identified specific residues within 5 Å of the cleaved HA product in the active site, as likely to be important for catalytic activity. We further selected several amino acids that lined a groove capable of accommodating a full-length HA polymer prior to cleavage. Accordingly, point mutations were generated at residues Asp129, Glu131, Tyr202, Asn216, Tyr247, Ser245, and Arg265 to investigate their individual contributions to the enzyme mechanism. Fig. 1 illustrates the positions of these residues in the active site of human Hyal1 relative to HA. Substrate-proximal residues fell into three regions: residues still in contact with the residual tetrasaccharide that can be presumed involved in binding and substrate recognition; residues in non-covalent bond distance from the newly cleaved end of the substrate, including Asp129 and Glu131, that are obvious candidates for direct catalytic roles; and residues proximal to the cleavage point of the substrate that were likely to have been in contact with a transition state and/or the released portion of the cleaved HA chain, such as Tyr202 and Tyr247. Analogy to point mutations in both sperm hyaluronidase, PH-20 (25Arming S. Strobl B. Wechselberger C. Kreil G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and bacterial N-acetylglucosaminidase H (20Rao V. Cui T. Guan C. Van Roey P. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2338-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), further suggested Asp129 and Glu131 would be critical for catalytic activity of the enzyme. Arg265 has previously been predicted to be important for substrate binding. Asn216 is a putative N-glycosylation site and its placement within the substrate groove led us to test its importance for enzyme activity and/or substrate binding. The roles of the serine and tyrosine residues have not been examined in any hyaluronidases. Wild-type and all Hyal1 point mutants were expressed and secreted to conditioned media (Fig. 2A). Initial characterization of enzyme activities was performed at a single HA concentration in HA-coated microwell plates, using concentrated culture media from transfected tumor cells (Fig. 2B). Results of these assays demonstrated negligible activity for the E131Q mutant (0.11 ± 0.01 units/ml of culture media per mg of Hyal1), similar to the vector-transfected control media (NC, 0.07 ± 0.01 units/ml/mg). This value is 0.26 ± 0.03% of wild-type Hyal1 activity. Catalytic function was also significantly diminished by D129N mutagenesis (1.4 ± 0.3% of wild-type activity), as well as Y202F (5.6 ± 1.4%), Y247F (4.8 ± 0.7%), and R265L (1.4 ± 0.6%). S245A retained 36 ± 6% of normal activity, whereas N216A had no effect. The relative effects on activity were also observed when soluble lysates from the respective transfectants were assayed in the microplate format (data not shown). Thus, the acidic and tyrosine residues, as well as serine 245 and arginine 265, appeared to have prominent roles in the hyaluronidase activity of Hyal1. To address the specific functions of individual residues more rigorously, we subsequently purified each Hyal1 species from HEK293 transfectant media, because these cells were more easily transfected and yielded greater protein quantities. Glutamate 131 and Tyrosine 247 Are Essential Catalytic Residues-For kinetic analyses, we measured Hyal1 activity by the method of Reissig et al. (36Reissig J.L. Storminger J.L. Leloir L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 959-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which cleavage events are quantified by the reaction of liberated N-acetylglucosamine ends with a colorimetric substrate. Activity of the wild-type enzyme was saturable with increasing substrate concentration (Fig. 3A). Apparent kinetic constants Km and Vmax were calculated by non-linear curve fitting of the data to an equation for single site association, considering all HA substrate and product sizes equally (Table 1). Activity values for each mutant at the 50 μm coating concentration used in the microplate assay were also compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. Analysis of E131Q kinetics revealed no significant activity at any HA concentration tested, even with 5-fold more enzyme added (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with results from the analogous PH-20 hyaluronidase mutant assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis (25Arming S. Strobl B. Wechselberger C. Kreil G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and with the above microplate assay. Although several of the mutants (i.e. D129N and Y202F, Fig. 3C, discussed below) showed clear dependence of activity on substrate concentration, E131Q did not. Identical results were observed with the Y247F mutant (Fig. 3D). Absence of activity at all substrate concentrations indicates Glu131 and Tyr247 have critical roles in the catalytic mechanism.TABLE 1Summary of Hyal1 wild-type (WT) and mutant kinetic constantsEnzymeKmVmax% WT activity at 50 μm HAμmμmol/min/mgHayl1 wild-type38.1 ± 4.812.5 ± 0.7100.0 ± 1.8Catalytic mutantsE131QNAaNA indicates no measurable activity at any HA concentration.NA0.08 ± 0"

Bifunctional proteins additionally catalyze the hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp. We have earlier demonstrated that although both catalyze identical the (p)ppGpp synthesis reaction, they exhibit a differential response to Mg2+ due to a unique charge reversal in the synthesis domain; an RXKD motif in the synthesis domain of bifunctional protein is substituted by an EXDD motif in that of the monofunctional proteins. Here, we show that these motifs also determine substrate specificities (GTP/GDP), cooperativity, and regulation of catalytic activities at the N-terminal region through the C-terminal region. Most importantly, a mutant bifunctional Rel carrying an EXDD instigates a novel catalytic reaction, resulting in the synthesis of pGpp by an independent hydrolysis of the 5′Pα-O-Pβ bond of GTP/GDP or (p)ppGpp. Further experiments with RelA from Escherichia coli wherein EXDD is naturally present also revealed the presence of pGpp, albeit at low levels.

The adaptability to changing environments determines the survival of an organism. Microorganisms utilize a hyperphosphorylated guanine nucleotide guanosine 5′-(tri- or di)phosphate,3′-diphosphate ((p)ppGpp), 6The abbreviations used are: (p)ppGpp, ppGpp (guanosine 5′-diphosphate,3′-diphosphate) and pppGpp (guanosine 5′-triphosphate,3′-diphosphate); pGpp (guanosine 5′-monophosphate,3′-diphosphate; AMP-CPP, adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)triphosphate; WT, wild type; MT, mutant. also known as the “alarmone” to cope up with unfavorable environmental conditions. (p)ppGpp, through a phenomenon termed the “stringent response,” accomplishes this by a rapid shutdown of active transcription, translation, and up-regulation of protein degradation and amino acid synthesis (1Cashel M. Gentry D. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). The major effect of stringent response is so far attributed to the interactions of ppGpp to RNA polymerase, σ factors, and DksA (2Artsimovitch I. Patlan V. Sekine S. Vassylyeva M.N. Hosaka T. Ochi K. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 3Perederina A. Svetlov V. Vassylyeva M.N. Tahirov T.H. Yokoyama S. Artsimovitch I. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 118: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Apart from its effect on transcription and translation, (p)ppGpp is implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of physiological processes including sporulation, antibiotic production, nucleotide and fatty acid metabolism, surface organelle production, and more importantly, in the virulence of pathogenic organisms (4Potrykus K. Cashel M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 62: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). (p)ppGpp is synthesized and hydrolyzed by two distinct domains in the N-terminal region of the Rel family of proteins (5Avarbock A. Avarbock D. Teh J. Buckstein M. Wang Z. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9913-9923Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Cashel M. Gallant J. Nature. 1969; 221: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 7Haseltine W.A. Block R. Gilbert W. Weber K. Nature. 1972; 238: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). They are further grouped into a Rel/SpoT bifunctional class (that synthesize and hydrolyze) and a RelA monofunctional class (that can only synthesize) (8Sajish M. Tiwari D. Rananaware D. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34977-34983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although both domains are present in all Rel proteins, monofunctional proteins lack hydrolysis activity due to the absence of a conserved HDXXED motif in the hydrolysis domain (9Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 469-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although the synthesis and hydrolysis activities are confined to the N-terminal ∼385 amino acids, the C-terminal region (∼385–750) ensures their regulation (10Jain V. Saleem-Batcha R. Chatterji D. Biophys. Chem. 2007; 127: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2878-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In Streptococcus equisimilis (RelS. eq), a bifunctional protein, the C-terminal region renders a negative regulatory effect on the synthesis activity and facilitates hydrolysis; deletion of the C-terminal region enhances synthesis activity by ∼12-fold while significantly reducing the hydrolysis activity (∼150-fold) (11Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2878-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A direct interaction of C-terminal region with the synthesis domain has also been reported (10Jain V. Saleem-Batcha R. Chatterji D. Biophys. Chem. 2007; 127: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, the key players remain elusive. During stress, Rel proteins catalyze the transfer of a pyrophosphate from ATP to the 3′-OH of GTP or GDP to synthesize pppGpp or ppGpp, respectively, collectively termed as (p)ppGpp (7Haseltine W.A. Block R. Gilbert W. Weber K. Nature. 1972; 238: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 12Sy J. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2002; 10: 779-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). As favorable conditions are restored, the stringent response can be reversed by the hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp to GTP/GDP and pyrophosphate (PPi) by the bifunctional Rel proteins. Although both GTP and GDP can act as pyrophosphate acceptors for (p)ppGpp synthesis, the Rel proteins seem to display differential preference for either GDP or GTP; Rel from RelS. eq prefers GTP over GDP (11Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2878-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and Rel from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (RelM. tb) (14Avarbock D. Salem J. Li L. Wang Z. Rubin H. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and RelA from Escherichia coli (RelAE. coli) (15Cochran W.J. Byrne R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 353-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are reported to utilize both GTP and GDP with equal efficiency. However, as the intracellular concentration of GDP is very low, it is believed that GTP would be the principal pyrophosphate acceptor (1Cashel M. Gentry D. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar), and this notion is substantiated by the presence of phosphatases like GppA that hydrolyze pppGpp to ppGpp (16Keasling J.D. Bertsch L. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7029-7033Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Kuroda A. Murphy H. Cashel M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21240-21243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in E. coli ppGpp has been shown to be the most potent molecule to elicit stringent response (1Cashel M. Gentry D. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar, 4Potrykus K. Cashel M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 62: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), which would imply a preference for GDP. In line with this, a closer analysis revealed that differences in (p)ppGpp synthesis by RelAE. coli and RelM. tb, reported in our earlier work, are not in consensus with the aforesaid equal preference for GTP and GDP. Earlier, using the N-terminal regions of Rel proteins, we had shown that they differ in utilizing Mg2+ for (p)ppGpp synthesis and had attributed this difference to a charge reversal in the synthesis domain where an RXKD in the bifunctional protein is substituted to an EXDD in monofunctional proteins (8Sajish M. Tiwari D. Rananaware D. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34977-34983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, using the full-length proteins, we further explore the significance of the distinct conservation of these motifs in Rel proteins. In contrast to the earlier reports, we found that monofunctional RelAE. coli utilizes GDP and bifunctional RelM. tb utilizes GTP as the principal pyrophosphate acceptor, and this specificity is determined by the EXDD and RXKD motifs, respectively. We further find that the presence of an RXKD motif also leads to cooperative nucleotide binding, whereas EXDD does not. Interestingly, in bifunctional protein the substitution RXKD → EXDD (in RelM. tb) led to a drastic reduction in (p)ppGpp synthesis (where → indicates the interchange of the motifs). In contrast, a similar reversal in monofunctional proteins (i.e. EXDD → RXKD in RelAE. coli) resulted in enhanced synthesis. Analogous effects were not found when the N-terminal regions of the proteins were employed (8Sajish M. Tiwari D. Rananaware D. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34977-34983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), implying a critical role for these motifs in determining the regulation of catalytic activities through their interaction with the C-terminal region. The most important finding, however, is that RXKD → EXDD substitution in the bifunctional RelM. tb resulted in the synthesis of a novel molecule that we identify as pGpp. Inspired by this observation, we probed the ability of RelAE. coli, which naturally carries an EXDD motif, to synthesize pGpp. The presence of pGpp in this reaction, albeit at low levels, opens the avenue to explore the significance of pGpp versus (p)ppGpp in microbial physiology. Cloning, Expression, and Purification-rel from M. tuberculosis was amplified using forward (5′-TTAGAATTCCATATGACCGCCCAACGCAGCACCACC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGATCCAAGCTTTTACCAGTCGAGCAGCTGACGCATCCA-3′) primers from genomic DNA. Amplicon was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into corresponding sites in pET-28 expression vector (Novagen). E. coli relA gene was amplified from its genomic DNA using primers (5′-GTTGCGGCATATGGTTGCGGTAAGAAGTGC-3′) and (5′-AATAAGCTTTAAGCTGCGTACTTCGTCGAG-3′) and similarly cloned into pET-28. Protein expression was carried out in E. coli. BL21 pLys cells from 2 liters of growth media were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol. Cells were lysed by sonication. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 35,000 relative centrifugal force for 30 min followed by loading onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted using a gradient of 20 column volumes (0–0.5 m) of imidazole, and the protein eluted at 40% of the gradient. The purified protein was then subjected to gel-filtration chromatography (Superdex 200, Amersham Biosciences). The buffer was exchanged with 50 mm HEPES (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The monomer fraction of the protein was collected, which had a final concentration of 0.3–0.5 mg/ml and was stored at –80 °C after snap-freezing in liquid N2. The total yield was 0.5 mg. (p)ppGpp Synthesis Assay-pppGpp/ppGpp synthesis assays were carried out as described earlier (8Sajish M. Tiwari D. Rananaware D. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34977-34983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A 5-μl reaction volume contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2 for RXKD-containing proteins, 50 mm for EXDD-containing proteins (8Sajish M. Tiwari D.

ATP and GTP/GDP were varied from 0 to 20 mm (with corresponding variations in Mg2+ concentrations) for cooperative ATP and GTP/GDP binding studies. The reactions were stopped by adding 1 μl of 6 m formic acid. The mixture was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. 5 μl of the sample was spotted on the polyethyleneimine-coated TLC (Merck), resolved in 1.5 m KH2PO4 (pH 3.4) buffer, and subjected to autoradiography to detect the formation of (p)ppGpp. For quantitation, the spots corresponding to (p)ppGpp were cored out from polyethyleneimine-coated TLC, and the counts were determined. To determine the kinetic constants for GTP/GDP, reactions were carried out as described above with varying concentrations of GTP/GDP (0–15 mm), 15 mm ATP for 10 min at 37 °C. For the RXKD-containing proteins, Mg2+ concentration was equal to that of the total nucleotides and for EXDD-containing proteins, 5-fold higher concentrations were used. 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/reaction was used as tracer for determining concentrations of the product. Km and Vmax values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis carried out with GraphPad prism software. pGpp Synthesis Assay-The efficiency of MT-RelM. tb to synthesize pGpp when GTP and GMP are provided as substrates was compared in Fig. 4C. For these, synthesis reactions were carried out as above using 5 mm GTP/GMP as the substrate along with 5 mm ATP and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and spotted on a polyethyleneimine-TLC. For quantitation, the spots corresponding to pGpp were cored out from polyethyleneimine-TLC, and the counts were determined. pppGpp Hydrolysis Assay-pppGpp hydrolysis assays were carried out in 5-μl reaction volumes containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm pppGpp32, and 5 μm WT or MT-RelM. tb proteins at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 6 m formic acid. The mixture was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. 5 μl of the sample was spotted on the polyethyleneimine-coated TLC (Merck), resolved in 1.5 m KH2PO4 (pH 3.4) buffer, and subjected to autoradiography to detect the release of PPi. For quantitation, the spots corresponding to PPi were cored out from polyethyleneimine-coated TLC, and the counts were determined. Intrinsic Chemical Stability of the New Product-MT-RelM. tb was employed in a (p)ppGpp synthesis assay, and the stability of the new product (see “Results”) formed, pGpp, was tested for its identity from its isoform, ppGp. After the synthesis reaction for 30 min, the enzyme was heat-inactivated, and 1 μl of 2 n NaOH was added to 5 μl of the reaction. It was spotted on a polyethyleneimine-coated TLC (as above) together with a negative control devoid of NaOH. Site-directed Mutagenesis-Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by overlapping PCR method as described earlier (8Sajish M. Tiwari D. Rananaware D. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34977-34983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The following forward and reverse primers were used, with desired change in the codon sequence. In RelM. tb Arg-348 and Lys-350 were mutated to Glu and Asp, respectively (RelM. tb R348E/K350D forward primer, 5′-ATGGCGGGTGAGTTCGACGACTACATCGC-3′; RelM. tb R348E/K350D reverse primer 5′-GCGATGTAGTCGTCGAACTCACCCGCCATC-3′). In RelAE. coli Glu-306 and Asp-308 were mutated to Arg and Lys, respectively (RelAE. coliE306R/D308K forward primer, 5′-CGCCACCTGCCCGGGCGGTTTAAGGATTACGTCGC-3′; RelAE. coli E306R/D308K, reverse primer, 5′-GCGACGTAATCCTTAAACCGCCCGGGCAGGTGGCG-3′). In each case, the fragments were amplified (Pfu DNA polymerase) using the forward primer of the gene and the reverse primer containing the mutation and the reverse primer of the gene and the forward primer with the mutation. Amplified fragments were gel-purified. Equal quantities of both fragments were used as template for the full-length amplification of the gene with mutation using the initial primers. The PCR-amplified mutant gene was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into corresponding sites in pET-28 vector. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence-Tryptophan fluorescence studies were carried out using LS 55 Fluorescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature. The protein was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (slit width of 2.5 nm) and emission wavelength of 300–500 nm (slit width of 5 nm). RelAE. coli Utilizes GDP as the Primary Pyrophosphate Acceptor-In our earlier work, we reported a differential effect of Mg2+ on (p)ppGpp synthesis by the N-terminal fragments of monofunctional and bifunctional Rel proteins (8Sajish M. Tiwari D. Rananaware D. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34977-34983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When synthesis reactions were carried out using the N-terminal regions of RelAE. coli and mutant RelM. tb (RXKD → EXDD) with ATP and GTP as substrates, we were surprised to observe an additional spot in the autoradiograms apart from pppGpp (8Sajish M. Tiwari D. Rananaware D. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34977-34983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, the same assay was performed using full-length RelAE. coli (WT-RelAE. coli). Like the N-terminal fragments, it also showed an additional spot in the autoradiograms (Fig. 1, dotted circle in lane 1) apart from the anticipated pppGpp (pentaphosphate) (lane 1, Fig. 1). Based on its position in polyethyleneimine-coated TLC, the additional spot appeared to be the tetraphosphate, ppGpp. To confirm this GTP was replaced by GDP, which resulted in the formation of ppGpp (tetraphosphate) (lane 2, Fig. 1). The position of the additional spot indeed corresponds to the ppGpp produced in lane 2. However, ppGpp synthesis in lane 1 was intriguing, as no GDP was provided in the reaction except a possible contaminant in the GTP pool that might arise from the intrinsic hydrolysis of GTP. The formation of ppGpp utilizing even the trace amount of contaminant GDP would indicate a very high affinity of RelAE. coli for GDP. This rationale would be contrary to the earlier reports that suggested equal affinity of WT-RelAE. coli for GTP and GDP (15Cochran W.J. Byrne R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 353-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the additional spot could also be detected with the N-terminal fragment of mutant RelM. tb that had an EXDD motif (8Sajish M. Tiwari D. Rananaware D. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34977-34983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) like WT-RelAE. coli. Taken together, these results indicated EXDD-containing proteins to have a higher affinity for GDP than GTP. On the other hand, Rel from S. equisimilis (RelS. eq) was reported to have a higher affinity for GTP over GDP (11Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2878-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and RelM. tb was reported to utilize GTP and GDP with equal efficiency (14Avarbock D. Salem J. Li L. Wang Z. Rubin H. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both RelM. tb (14Avarbock D. Salem J. Li L. Wang Z. Rubin H. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and RelS. eq (11Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2878-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) are bifunctional proteins with an RXKD motif. To clarify the role of these motifs, if any, in dictating the specificities for GTP and GDP, the following experiments were conducted. EXDD and RXKD Motifs Determine Substrate Specificity and Nucleotide Binding-To examine the specificities for GTP/GDP and the role of EXDD/RXKD motifs in governing this specificity, we used four Rel proteins; two wild types (WT-RelAE. coli with an EXDD and WT-RelM. tb with an RXKD) and their mutants where the motifs were interchanged (MT-RelAE. coli with EXDD → RXKD and MT-RelM. tb with RXKD → EXDD). Each protein was subjected to an independent synthesis reaction using ATP and either GTP or GDP as substrates. The highest amount of product synthesized (pppGpp when GTP is the substrate and ppGpp when GDP is the substrate) by each protein was taken as 100% as shown in Fig. 2A. Here, RXKD-containing proteins (WT-RelM. tb and MT-RelAE. coli) show a distinct preference for GTP over GDP, whereas the EXDD containing proteins (WT-RelAE. coli and MT-RelM. tb) conversely prefer GDP over GTP. The preference for GTP/GDP by these motifs is further substantiated by the kinetic constants, as shown in Table 1. GDP is preferred over GTP by WT-RelAE. coli (EXDD) with a lower Km and a higher Vmax, reflected in ∼15-fold higher catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) for GDP over GTP. On the other hand, RXKD-containing WT-RelM. tb and MT-RelAE. coli show a preference for GTP over GDP, shown by their lower Km and higher Vmax for GTP. These values are not in agreement with the kinetic constants reported earlier (5Avarbock A. Avarbock D. Teh J. Buckstein M. Wang Z. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9913-9923Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Cochran W.J. Byrne R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 353-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the wild type proteins RelAE. coli and RelM. tb, as they were determined in the presence of cofactors (mRNA, tRNA, and/or ribosome) or denaturants (methanol or detergents) that were absent in our study. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate the importance of the motifs RXKD/EXDD in governing substrate specificities in Rel proteins.TABLE 1The kinetic constants for GTP and GDP in RXKD and EXDD containing Rel proteinsProtein (motif)KmGTPKmGDPVmax GTPVmax GDPVmax/Km (GTP)Vmax/Km (GDP)μmμmμm pppGpp formed/minμm ppGpp formed/minWT-RelAE. coli (EXDD)3703 ± 379532 ± 2.560 ± 1.7142 ± 0.651622667MT-RelAE. coli (RXKD)1156 ± 892201 ± 58.5249.13 ± 7.5549.98 ± 1.52155227WT-RelM. tb (RXKD)1579 ± 70.92315 ± 250164.7 ± 0.4762.5 ± 3.51043270 Open table in a new tab It appears that the monofunctional RelAE. coli prefers GDP over GTP, and the bifunctional RelM. tb prefers GTP over GDP, like RelS. eq. As co-operative ATP binding was reported for RelS. eq (11Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2878-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we examined the same for RelM. tb and RelAE. coli to investigate the effect of the motifs RXKD/EXDD, if any. The aforesaid (p)ppGpp synthesis assays were carried out to examine cooperativity in nucleotide binding. Percent (p)ppGpp synthesized (% activity) was plotted against increasing ATP (Fig. 2B) and GTP (Fig. 2C) concentrations for WT-RelAE. coli, MT-RelAE. coli, and WT-RelM. tb. WT-RelM. tb, like RelS. eq (11Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2878-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), having an RXKD motif, also exhibited a cooperative ATP binding as suggested by the sigmoidal nature of the curve (Fig. 2B). Similarly, cooperative GTP binding also was observed for WT-RelM. tb (Fig. 2C). WT-RelAE. coli, with an EXDD motif, on the other hand, displayed a hyperbolic behavior indicating the absence of cooperativity for both ATP and GTP binding. However, the hyperbolic behavior was reversed to sigmoidal behavior when MT-RelAE. coli, having an RXKD motif, was employed (Fig. 2, B and C). A reversal to hyperbolic nature in MT-RelM. tb, with an EXDD motif, could not be shown, as the activity of the protein was compromised significantly (see below). These experiments indicate that RXKD motif, but not EXDD, renders cooperative nucleotide binding. Effect of Interchanging EXDD and RXKD on (p)ppGpp Synthesis-To understand the effect of interchanging the motifs, the four proteins mentioned above were used to analyze their catalytic activities. (p)ppGpp synthesis and hydrolysis reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Percent (p)ppGpp synthesized by these proteins utilizing GDP (for EXDD proteins) and GTP (for RXKD proteins) is shown in Fig. 3A. Intriguingly, MT-RelAE. coli (EXDD → RXKD) showed an enhanced synthesis (∼2.5-fold) compared with WT-RelAE. coli, whereas MT-RelM. tb (RXKD → EXDD) displayed a drastic reduction (∼90% of WT-RelM. tb) (Fig. 3A) without significantly affecting (p)ppGpp hydrolysis (data not shown). The contrasting behavior of these mutants led us to probe if any conformational change in the protein affected the synthesis activity. This was examined utilizing the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. A major difference in the fluorescence spectra was seen for WT-RelAE. coli versus MT-RelAE. coli (Fig. 3B). But on the contrary, RelM. tb proteins (WT-RelM. tb and MT-RelM. tb) did not exhibit any difference (Fig. 3C). As EXDD → RXKD in MT-RelAE. coli led to an enhanced (∼2.5-fold) synthesis and reduced fluorescence, we wanted to discern the candidate tryptophan that contributed significantly toward the reduced fluorescence. A sequence-based structural comparison with RelS. eq identified Trp-260 (see the inset, Fig. 3, B and C) as a potential residue based on its position in the catalytic loop. This loop is believed to play an important role in regulating the synthesis activity (8Sajish M. Tiwari D. Rananaware D. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34977-34983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Cell. 2004; 117: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). W260A mutant was, thus, prepared to examine its role, and as expected, the mutation resulted in a drastic reduction in intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 3B), suggesting Trp-260 as the major contributor to the intrinsic fluorescence of WT-RelAE. coli. The implications of these observations are discussed under “Discussion.” The Presence of EXDD Generates a New Catalytic Site-A reduction in the synthesis activity by MT-RelM. tb was unanticipated. However, we were surprised by the presence of a new spot (circled in lanes 4 and 5; Fig. 4A) in the autoradiograms of (p)ppGpp synthesis reactions catalyzed by MT-RelM. tb. The new spot was not seen when WT-RelM. tb (lanes 2 and 3) or the N-terminal domains (8Sajish M. Tiwari D. Rananaware D. Nandicoori V.K. Prakash B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34977-34983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were used, and its migration was similar to that of [γ-32P]GTP (lane 6, Fig. 4A). Mobilities similar to GTP indicated that the new product might contain identical number of phosphates on the guanine nucleoside, suggesting pGpp, ppGp, or pppG as the possible molecules. Because [γ-32P]ATP was used in lanes 4 and 5, where the new molecule is formed, it must bear a radiolabeled pyrophosphate transferred from [γ-32P]ATP to the 3′-OH of the guanine nucleotide. This eliminates ppGp and pppG as candidates, and hence, the product should be 5′-pGpp-3′. This was further examined by intrinsic (in)stability of the new product under alkaline conditions. This is because the presence of β-phosphates at the 3′-OH is known to be alkali-labile (19Cashel M. Kalbacher B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2309-2318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 4B, the new product (circled in lane 1) disappears when the reaction was subjected to alkaline conditions (lane 2), indicating that the new product"

Here we describe a new function for FAK in the regulation of centrosome functions in a Ser-732 phosphorylation-dependent manner during mitosis. Deletion of FAK in primary ECs causes increases in centrosome numbers, multipolar and disorganized spindles, and unaligned chromosomes during mitosis. Re-expression of wild-type FAK, but not S732A mutant, rescued these mitotic defects, suggesting a role for Ser-732 phosphorylation in the regulation of centrosomal functions. Consistent with this possibility, Ser-732-phosphorylated FAK was found to co-localize in centrosomes in mitotic cells. FAK also associated with cytoplasmic dynein in a Ser-732 phosphorylation-dependent manner. Further analysis in FAK-null primary ECs showed that S732A mutant could rescue EC migration but not proliferation or tubulogenesis in vitro. Last, we showed that deletion of FAK in ECs reduced tumor angiogenesis in vivo, which could be restored by re-expression of wild-type FAK but not S732A mutant.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 2The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; EC, endothelial cell; ROCK, Rho-dependent kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is a major mediator of signal transduction by integrins and also participates in signaling by other cell surface receptors in a variety of cells, including endothelial cells (ECs) (1Parsons J.T.

Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In most adherent cells FAK is activated upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins through disruption of an intramolecular inhibitory interaction between its amino-terminal FERM domain and the kinase domain (5Cooper L.A. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8030-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Lietha D. Cai X. Ceccarelli D.F. Li Y. Schaller M.D. Eck M.J. Cell. 2007; 129: 1177-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Once it is activated, FAK undergoes autophosphorylation at Tyr-397, which creates a binding site for several SH2 (Src homology 2) domain-containing proteins including Src family kinases (1Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 2Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The associated Src could then phosphorylate additional sites on FAK, including residues Tyr-576 and Tyr-577 in its activation loop, to further activate FAK and Tyr-925 to create binding sites for the adaptor molecule Grb2 (7Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 8Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell.

FAK also functions as a scaffold to mediate Src family kinase phosphorylation of several proteins, including paxillin (10Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 11Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), p130cas (12Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2005; 9: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which bound to the carboxyl-terminal region of FAK. This cascade of phosphorylation events and protein-protein interactions has been shown to trigger several signaling pathways in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions in different cells. Besides these well characterized tyrosine phosphorylations, recent studies have identified FAK phosphorylation on several serine residues (15Ma A. Richardson A. Schaefer E.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Grigera P.R. Jeffery E.D. Martin K.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the post-mitotic neurons, Ser-732 has been shown to be phosphorylated by Cdk5, which plays an important role in microtubule organization and proper nuclear movement during neuronal migration (17Xie Z. Sanada K. Samuels B.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 469-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 18Xie Z. Tsai L.H. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 108-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Ser-732-phosphorylated FAK is enriched in centrosome-associated microtubule fork that abuts the nucleus and a perinuclear region around the centrosome, consistent with its regulation of these functions in neurons. Ser-732 of FAK has also been shown to be phosphorylated by Rho-dependent kinase (ROCK) in ECs, which has been suggested to play a role in vascular endothelial growth factor-stimulated EC migration (19Le Boeuf F. Houle F. Sussman M. Huot J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3508-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to Ser-732, Ser-722, Ser-843, and Ser-910 in the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK have also been found to be phosphorylated and regulate cell spreading and migration in recent studies (16Grigera P.R.

Physiol. 2004; 200: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, our understanding of serine phosphorylation of FAK is very limited in contrast to the wealth of information on the regulation and function of tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. In particular, it is not clear whether and how serine phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and proliferation by FAK. Focal adhesion localization of FAK in adherent cells is essential for its functions in the regulation of cell migration as well as proliferation (1Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 2Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). During mitosis, however, focal adhesion complexes dissociate as cells round up and detach from extracellular matrix. Interestingly, serine phosphorylation of FAK is increased during mitosis, and this has been suggested to cause FAK dissociation from p130Cas and Src to inactivate signaling at focal adhesions (25Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. Fry D. Zhang X. Hanks S.K. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), although the relevant sites of phosphorylation were not mapped in this study. It is not known whether FAK is localized to any specific subcellular structures and/or plays a role in mitosis and whether these are regulated by serine phosphorylation of FAK in mitotic cells. Consistent with its critical importance in the regulation of various cellular functions, deletion of FAK gene leads to early embryonic lethality at embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) due to defects in the axial mesodermal tissues including the cardiovascular system with incomplete development of both the blood vessels and the heart (26Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Using a conditional mouse KO approach, we and others have recently shown a role of FAK in vascular angiogenesis through its regulation of multiple functions of ECs including their survival, proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis (27Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28Braren R. Hu H. Kim Y.H. Beggs H.E.

The availability of the floxed FAK mice and ECs isolated from these mice also allowed us to investigate FAK signaling pathways involved in the regulation of EC functions and angiogenesis in vivo by a reconstitution strategy, where endogenous FAK is deleted via recombinant adenoviruses encoding Cre followed by re-expression of FAK or its various mutants in ECs both in vitro and in vivo. In this study we present data showing a novel function of FAK in the regulation of centrosomal functions in a Ser-732 phosphorylation-dependent manner in ECs during mitosis, which plays a role in the regulation of EC proliferation and tubulogenesis in vitro and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Recombinant Adenoviruses-Recombinant adenoviruses encoding Cre recombinase or lacZ control were purchased from Gene Transfer Vector Core (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). The recombinant adenoviruses encoding FAK (Ad-FAK), its kinase-defective (Ad-KD), Y397F (Ad-Y397F), P712A/P715A (Ad-P712A/P715A), and S732A (Ad-S732A) mutants, or GFP control (Ad-GFP) were generated using the Adeasy-1 system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Isolation and Infection of ECs-ECs were isolated from 4-6-week-old homozygous FAK floxed mice using the magnetic bead (Dyanbead M-450; Dynal Corp.) purification protocol with rat anti-mouse PECAM-1 (BD Biosciences), as described previously (27Shen T.L.

Isolated ECs were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 100 with Ad-lacZ or Ad-Cre. To increase efficiency, a second infection was performed after 9-12 h and incubated for 48 h. For the rescue experiments, cells infected with Ad-Cre were re-infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding FAK, its mutants, or Ad-GFP 2 days after infection of Ad-Cre at a multiplicity of infection of 100. No detectable cell toxicity was observed. Cell Culture and Transfections-Isolated ECs were cultured on a 0.1% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated dish in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies), and heparin (100 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) (27Shen T.L.

Flow Cytometry Analysis-ECs were fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol at 4 °C for more than 2 h. After fixation cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) with 100 μg/ml RNase A in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Flow cytometry analysis was performed by a BD Biosciences BD-LSR II flow cytometer. Immunofluorescence Staining-Cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining as described previously (32Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were anti-Ser(P)-732 FAK (BioSource; 1:100), anti-α-tubulin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.; 1:50), anti-γ-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:100), anti-dynein intermediate chain (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:100) and anti-BrdUrd (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:50). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory; 1:200) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory; 1:200) were used as the secondary antibodies. Cells were examined by a microscope (model BX41; Olympus) with an UplanF1 × 40/0.75 objective lens at room temperature. The images were captured using a camera (model DP70; Olympus) with DP Controller, Version 1.2.1.108. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting-Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis was performed as described previously (32Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies used are anti-FAK (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-dynein intermediate chain (clone 70.1; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-cdk5 (C8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-ROCK1 (H-85; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). BrdUrd Incorporation Assay-ECs were serum-starved for 18 h to arrest the cells in G0. A BrdUrd incorporation assay was performed as described previously (27Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Three independent experiments were performed, and the percentage of cells positive for BrdUrd was quantified using a microscope (model BX41; Olympus) with UplanF1 × 10/0.3 objective lens at room temperature. Approximately 100 cells were examined for each condition in each independent experiment. Wound Closure Cell Migration Assay-ECs were plated on gelatin-coated dishes (60 mm) and stimulated with 50 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor and then subjected to assays. Wound closure assays were performed as described previously (27Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J.

Tube Formation Assay-ECs were plated on a layer of Matrigel (growth factor-reduced, BD Biosciences) and allowed to form a tubular structure as described previously (27Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Tubulogenesis in each condition was examined on a microscope (model IX70; Olympus) with a UplanF1 × 10/0.3 objective lens and photographed with a progressive 3CCD camera (Sony) at room temperature. The length and branch points were determined using Image-Pro Plus, Version 3.0.00.00 as described previously (34Haskell H. Natarajan M. Hecker T.P. Ding Q. Stewart Jr., J. Grammer J.R. Gladson C.L.

Matrigel Plug Assays-Matrigel (growth factor-reduced, BD Biosciences) was supplemented with 5 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml recombinant adenoviruses and 5 × 105 B16F10 melanoma cells in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Matrigel mixture was then injected subcutaneously into the flank region of 8-week-old floxed FAK mice. Mice were sacrificed 10 days after injection, and Matrigel weights were determined. Vascularization in Matrigel plugs was visualized by immunohistological examination using anti-PECAM-1 antibody (M-20, 1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as described previously (27Shen T.L.

Five representative images were obtained from each Matrigel plug, and vessel density was quantified using Image-Pro Plus, Version 3.0.00.00. Deletion of FAK Causes Spindle and Centrosomal Abnormalities in Mitotic ECs-Previous studies of EC-specific FAK knock-out mice and isolated ECs showed a role of FAK in angiogenesis and vascular development due to its essential role in the regulation of EC functions, including proliferation, migration, cell survival, and tubulogenesis (27Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To further investigate mechanisms of FAK in the regulation of EC proliferation, we performed flow cytometric analyses to get more detailed information on the cell cycle profile in FAK-/- ECs. Primary ECs were isolated from floxed FAK mice and were infected by a recombinant adenovirus encoding Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) to delete endogenous FAK or by a control recombinant adenovirus encoding lacZ to produce FAK-/- ECs or control FAK+/+ ECs, respectively, as described previously (27Shen T.L. Park A.Y. Alcaraz A. Peng X. Jang I. Koni P. Flavell R.A. Gu H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Analysis of these cells by flow cytometry showed an altered cell cycle profile for FAK-/- ECs compared with the control FAK+/+ ECs (Fig. 1A). In consistent with our previous results showing an increased apoptosis in FAK-/- ECs, a significant increase in SubG1 population was found for these cells compared with FAK+/+ ECs (from about 10 to 22%). We also found a significantly increased G2/M population in FAK-/- ECs compared with FAK+/+ ECs (from about 20 to 32%), suggesting a possibly increased mitotic arrest upon FAK deletion in ECs. To investigate the mechanisms of mitotic abnormalities in FAK-/- ECs, we examined the effect of FAK deletion on mitotic spindle organization and chromosome alignment and segregation in these cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, normal mitotic spindles and chromosome alignment were detected in FAK+/+ ECs during mitosis by staining for α-tubulin and DNA, respectively (a, f, and k). In contrast, the analysis of FAK-/- ECs revealed various defects including multiple and randomly positioned spindles (b-d), loosely congregated chromosomes (g-i), and unaligned chromosomes (i and n, arrowheads). In some cells anaphase proceeded with an unattached chromosome (j and o, arrows). Because centrosomes are the primary microtubule organization center and play an essential role in mitotic spindle organization and chromosome segregation, we next evaluated possible defects in centrosome organizations in FAK-/- ECs by immunostaining for γ-tubulin, a centrosome marker. Fig. 1C shows that whereas FAK+/+ ECs have a typical staining of two centrosomes on the opposite sides of the condensed chromosomes during mitosis (a, f, and k), deletion of FAK in ECs (FAK-/- ECs) caused various centrosomal defects in the number, size, and position of centrosomes (b-e), which are associated with abnormal chromosome condensation in metaphase (g-i) and segregation in anaphase (j). Quantitation of ∼200 mitotic cells for each group showed centrosomal defects in about 60% of FAK-/- ECs compared with less than 10% of the control FAK+/+ ECs (Fig. 2B). Together, these results suggest that FAK plays a role in the regulation of mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and centrosome integrity during mitosis and that the deregulation of these functions caused by the deletion of FAK may be responsible for mitotic arrest in FAK-/- ECs. Ser-732 Phosphorylation of FAK Is Required for Its Regulation of Centrosome Function during Mitosis in Primary ECs-To investigate the mechanisms of FAK regulation of centrosome function during mitosis, we generated recombinant adenoviruses encoding several FAK mutants and analyzed their ability to rescue the mitotic defects in ECs upon deletion of endogenous FAK. Primary ECs isolated from floxed FAK mice were infected by Ad-Cre to delete endogenous FAK followed by infection with recombinant adenoviruses encoding FAK (Ad-FAK), kinase-defective (Ad-KD), Tyr-397 to Phe (Ad-Y397F), Pro-712 and Pro-715 to Ala (Ad-P712A/P715A), or Ser-732 to Ala (Ad-S732A) mutant. As expected, infection of Ad-Cre, but not Ad-LacZ, resulted in the deletion of FAK (see Fig. 1A, right panel). Re-infection of FAK-/- ECs with recombinant adenoviruses encoding FAK or its mutants led to expression of exogenous FAK and mutants to comparable levels in these cells (Fig. 2A). As expected, restoration of FAK expression in FAK-/- ECs significantly rescued the centrosomal abnormalities caused by deletion of endogenous FAK (Fig. 2B). Consistent with previous studies on the critical roles of Tyr-397 in FAK downstream signaling pathways initiated by autophosphorylation of this site, re-expression of either FAK Y397F or KD mutant did not rescue the centrosomal defects (Fig. 2B). In contrast to well characterized tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, the role of serine phosphorylation of FAK is relatively less investigated, although several serine residues of FAK have also been shown to be phosphorylated (15Ma A. Richardson A. Schaefer E.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Grigera P.R. Jeffery E.D. Martin K.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In particular, phosphorylation of Ser-732 in FAK by Cdk5 has been shown to play a role in nuclear translocation during neuronal migration through regulation of microtubule networks (17Xie Z. Sanada K. Samuels B.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 469-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). As the centrosome-associated microtubule structure, the mitotic spindle, plays a crucial role during mitosis in non-neuronal cells, we examined the potential role of Ser-732 phosphorylation in FAK regulation of centrosome function by analysis of FAK S732A mutant in the rescue experiments. We found that re-expression of S732A mutant did not rescue centrosomal abnormalities in FAK-/- ECs (Fig. 2B). Analysis of another FAK mutant, P712A/P715A, which is deficient in binding to p130Cas, rescued centrosomal defects in FAK-/- ECs to a comparable level as the wild-type FAK (Fig. 2B), suggesting that FAK signaling through p130Cas is not involved in the regulation of centrosome function. Together, these mutational analyses suggest a novel role of Ser-732 phosphorylation in mediating FAK regulation of centrosome functions during mitosis. Localization of Ser-732-phosphorylated FAK in Centrosomes during Mitosis-FAK is localized in focal adhesions in adherent cells, which are disassembled during mitosis. Previous studies have shown an increase of serine phosphorylation of FAK concomitant with cell rounding-up and disassembly of focal adhesions in mitotic cells (25Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. Fry D. Zhang X. Hanks S.K. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether serine-phosphorylated FAK are evenly distributed in the cytoplasm or are localized to particular subcellular structures in mitotic cells. In light of the above observation suggesting a potential role of Ser-732 phosphorylation of FAK in the integrity of centrosomes, we examined the possibility of a centrosomal localization of Ser-732-phosphorylated FAK in mitotic ECs. Primary FAK+/+ ECs at various phases of mitosis were subjected to double-label immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against phospho-Ser-732 of FAK (Ser(P)-732) and the centrosomal marker γ-tubulin. As shown in Fig. 3A, Ser-732-phosphorylated FAK was detected in the centrosomes throughout mitosis. The lack of staining in FAK-/- ECs by anti-Ser(P)-732 confirmed the specificity of the antibody against FAK Ser(P)-732 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, localization of Ser-732-phosphorylated FAK in the centrosomes was also detected in several other cell types, including murine embryonic fibroblasts, COS7 cells (Fig. 3C), and HeLa cells (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that FAK may regulate centrosome functions through acting on some components of centrosomes directly in a Ser-732 phosphorylation-dependent manner during mitosis. Ser-732 Phosphorylation-dependent Association of FAK with Cytoplasmic Dynein-To explore potential FAK targets, we examined various proteins localized in centrosomes for their potential association with FAK in a Ser-732 phosphorylation-dependent manner. FAK-/- ECs were infected with Ad-FAK, Ad-S732A, or Ad-GFP as a control, and lysates from these cells were immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc for the Myc-tagged FAK and S732A mutant and their associated proteins. Analysis of the immunoprecipitates by anti-dynein showed that it was associated with wild-type FAK but not S732A mutant (Fig. 4A). Previous studies suggested that Ser-732 of FAK can be phosphorylated by Cdk5 and ROCK1 in different cells (17Xie Z. Sanada K. Samuels B.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 469-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 19Le Boeuf F. Houle F. Sussman M. Huot J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3508-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effect of down-regulation of Cdk5 and ROCK1 on the association of FAK with cytoplasmic dynein. Lysates were prepared from 293T cells that had been transfected with vectors encoding Cdk5 shRNA, ROCK1 shRNA, or the vector alone control. Fig. 4B shows that interaction of FAK with cytoplasmic dynein was reduced by knockdown of expression of Cdk5, but not ROCK1, when compared with cells treated with control shRNA. Last, colocalization of Ser-732-phosphorylated FAK with dynein at centrosomes was also confirmed by double-label immunofluorescent staining of mitotic cells (Fig. 4C). Together, these results suggest that Cdk5-dependent Ser-732 phosphorylation of FAK and its binding to cytoplasmic dynein may play a role in the regulation of centrosome function during mitosis. Ser-732 Phosphorylation of FAK Is Required for Cell Proliferation and Tubulogenesis in Primary ECs-Our previous studies showed that inactivation of FAK in primary ECs caused increased apoptosis, reduced proliferation and migration, and reduced capillary formation on Matrigel, suggesting essential function of FAK in the regulation of multiple EC activities (27Shen T.L.

In the present study, we demonstrate that cytoglobin is a stress-responsive hemoprotein in the hypoxia-induced hypertrophic myocardium and it is transcriptionally regulated by calcineurin-dependent transcription factors. The cytoglobin transcript level is abundantly expressed in the adult heart and in response to hypoxia cytoglobin expression is markedly up-regulated within the hypoxia-induced hypertrophic heart. To define the molecular mechanism resulting in the induction of cytoglobin, we undertook a transcriptional analysis of the 5′ upstream regulatory region of the cytoglobin gene. Evolutionarily conserved binding elements for transcription factors HIF-1, AP-1, and NFAT are located within the upstream region of the cytoglobin gene. Transcriptional assays demonstrated that calcineurin activity modulates cytoglobin transcription. Increased calcineurin activity enhances the ability of NFAT and AP-1 to bind to the putative cytoglobin promoter, especially under hypoxic conditions. In addition, inhibition of calcineurin, NFAT, and/or AP-1 activities decreases endogenous cytoglobin transcript and protein levels. Thus, the regulation of cytoglobin transcription by calcineurin-dependent transcription factors suggests that cytoglobin may have a functional role in calcium-dependent events accompanying cardiac remodeling.

The development of ventricular hypertrophy is an adaptive response to a variety of cardiovascular stresses (e.g. hypoxia, ischemia, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension). Although hypertrophy serves to initially enhance cardiac output and normalize ventricular wall stress, the failure to alleviate the inciting stress results in this response becoming maladaptive, eventually leading to cardiac decompensation and heart failure. Ventricular hypertrophy has been implicated as an important predisposing risk factor for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in humans (1Levy D. Garrison R.J. Savage D.D. Kannel W.B.

Alterations in the redox state and activation of various signaling transduction pathways and stress-responsive proteins are known to occur in ventricular hypertrophy and these either directly contribute to cardiac growth or are activated in response to hypertrophy (2Heineke J.

However, unlike Mb, which is tissue-restricted to cardiomyocytes and oxidative skeletal myofibers, Cygb is more broadly expressed in adult tissues (4Burmester T. Ebner B. Weich B. Hankeln T. Mol.

These studies also suggest that Cygb may be more important in scavenging free radicals than in modulating O2 metabolism. Studies to date that have defined the functional role(s) for Cygb in mammalian tissues are limited and have not investigated the role of Cygb in cardiovascular biology (11Fordel E. Thijs L.

The objective in the present study was to define changes in Cygb gene expression in response to myocardial hypoxia and to investigate the regulatory mechanisms that govern changes in its gene expression profile. Identifying the regulatory mechanisms that modulate Cygb expression will provide important biological insight into its cellular function. The regulatory region of the Cygb gene has not been fully investigated. However, in the case of Mb, it has been well established that the 2-kb upstream region of the Mb gene contains the essential motifs that regulate its expression (13Parsons W.J. Richardson J.A.

Based upon the close homology of Cygb to Mb, we hypothesized that Cygb transcription is regulated by calcineurin-dependent transcription factors (NFAT and/or activator protein-1 (AP-1)). Given its response to hypoxia, we further hypothesized that Cygb expression is regulated by a hypoxia-responsive transcription factor. Therefore, in addition to NFAT and AP-1, we evaluated whether the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits, also regulates Cygb gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that Cygb transcription is increased in the hypoxia-induced hypertrophic myocardium. We present evidence that hypoxia increases binding of the transcription factors NFAT and AP-1 to the proximal promoter region of the Cygb gene. Furthermore, activation of both of these transcriptional elements is dependent on the activity of the phosphatase, calcineurin. Thus, our study enhances our overall understanding of the potential functional role for Cygb and supports the concept that Cygb is a stress-responsive hemoprotein that is sensitive to hypoxic stress. Animals and Tissue Processing—Adult C57BL/6 mice (2–4 months of age) were handled in accordance with National Institutes of Health and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center's (UTSW) Institutional Guidelines. Transgenic mice overexpressing either constitutively active calcineurin (CnA*) or regulator of calcineurin-1 (Rcan1) within the heart were generated utilizing the α-MHC promoter to specifically direct expression to the cardiomyocyte as previously described (18Molkentin J.D.

Hypoxia Chamber—An in vivo plexiglass hypoxia chamber (87 × 42 × 45 cm) was engineered to maintain a constant hypoxic environment of 10% oxygen (O2) and was monitored continuously for oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, temperature, and humidity. A detailed description of the hypoxia chamber has been published previously (20Mammen P.P. Kanatous S.B. Yuhanna I.S. Shaul P.W. Garry M.G. Balaban R.S. Garry D.J. Am. J. Physiol... 2003; 285: H2132-H2141Google Scholar). In addition, an in vitro hypoxia chamber (Billups-Rothenberg Inc.) was designed to expose C2C12 myoblasts to hypoxic conditions (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2) for varying lengths of time. This airtight modular chamber is 30 cm in diameter with inflow and outflow valves that maintain a constant hypoxic environment (1% O2). The humidity within the chamber was maintained constant during the duration of a hypoxic experiment by placing a Petri dish filled with 15 ml of sterile water within the chamber. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from normoxic and hypoxic hearts utilizing the TriPure isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using Superscript™ II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) to obtain cDNA as described previously (7Mammen P.P. Shelton J.M. Ye Q. Kanatous S.B.

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed as described previously, and Cygb expression was normalized to 18s ribosome (18s-RIB) expression (21Mammen P.P. Shelton J.M. Goetsch S.C. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Garry M.G. Garry D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem... 2002; 50: 1591-1598Google Scholar). The primer sets used to assess Cygb and 18s-RIB expression levels in these experiments were as follows: Cygb forward primer, 5′-CCAACTGCGAGGAC-3′; Cygb reverse primer, 5′-AGTTCACAAAGAAC-3′; 18s-RIB forward primer, 5′-TGCCACTGGCTGGT-3′; and 18s-RIB reverse primer, 5′-TTCACCACTTCTCT-3′. Northern Blot Analysis—The Strip-EZ DNA probe synthesis kit (Ambion) was utilized to construct the Cygb radioactive probe. Twenty-five nanograms of linearized Cygb cDNA and 5 μl of [α-32P]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) were used to produce the radioactive Cygb cDNA probe. A commercially purchased Northern blot membrane (MTN blot; BD Sciences) containing full-length transcripts from various adult murine tissues was incubated with the Cygb radioactive probe in Ultrahyb solution (Ambion) at 42 °C overnight. Following rinsing, the hybridized membrane was exposed to radiographic film at –80 °C for various lengths of time (6–48 h). β-Actin cDNA was used as a control probe to ensure equal loading of the lanes with RNA. Western Blot Analysis—Protein from whole heart or cell lysates was isolated from control and experimental groups. Western blot analysis was performed as published previously (7Mammen P.P.

Western blot analyses of nuclear and cytosolic extracts from cells and murine hearts were also processed as described previously (22Chaturvedi M.M. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol... 2000; 319: 585-602Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-Cygb serum was designed and engineered by the Antibody Core Facility at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. This polyclonal rabbit anti-Cygb serum (1:100 dilution) was used as the primary antiserum, which was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-serum. Western blot analyses to assess CnA, c-Jun, and c-Fos protein expression levels were performed using the respective antisera (CnA 1:1000, Sigma; c-Jun 1:200 and c-Fos 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antisera to lamin A/C and Sp1 were used to ensure the purity of the nuclear extracts (lamin A/C 1:200 and Sp1 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology.). The mouse monoclonal α-tubulin antibody (1:3,000; Sigma) was used as a standard to ensure equal protein loading of the lanes. Band intensity was quantitated using a computerized digital analysis program (ImageJ 1.24; Scion Corp.). Plasmid Construction and Luciferase Reporter Assay—Segments of the 5′ upstream region of the Cygb gene were cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) and inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter. NFAT and AP-1 responsive elements (NRE and ARE) within the mouse Cygb promoter region were disrupted using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (14Bassel-Duby R. Grohe C.M.

Because transient transfection of plasmids into primary cardiomyocytes is inefficient, with low transfection rates, we utilized C2C12 cells as a muscle cell line to undertake our transcriptional analysis. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in growth media as described previously (14Bassel-Duby R. Grohe C.M. Jessen M.E. Parsons W.J. Richardson J.A. Chao R. Grayson J. Ring W.S. Williams R.S. Circ.

S. A... 2001; 98: 3328-3333Google Scholar). Utilizing Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), each well of a 6-well plate was co-transfected with the Cygb promoter-reporter plasmid (0.5 μg) and an expression plasmid driven by a CMV promoter (CnA*, HIF-1*, Rcan1, NFATc1-GFP, and/or c-Fos/c-Jun) or empty vector (pCl-NEO; 0.5 μg), along with a CMV-LacZ plasmid (0.5 μg) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. In experiments designed to assess the effect of inhibiting calcineurin activity on Cygb transcription, the cells were either co-transfected with a CMV-driven Rcan1 expression plasmid or treated with cyclosporin A (CsA, 10 μm; Calbiochem). After transfection of the respective plasmids, the cells were cultured under either normoxic (21% O2, 5% CO2, 74% N2) or hypoxic (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2) conditions. After a 16-h exposure to either normoxia or hypoxia, the C2C12 cells were harvested. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays of whole cell extracts were conducted as described previously (14Bassel-Duby R. Grohe C.M. Jessen M.E. Parsons W.J. Richardson J.A. Chao R. Grayson J. Ring W.S.

Finally, to demonstrate that the cells were exposed to hypoxic conditions, HRE-Luc was transfected into C2C12 cells with or without the HIF-1* plasmid, and luciferase activity was assessed (data not shown). Quantification of NFAT Nuclear Translocation—C2C12 cells were transiently transfected with an NFATc1-GFP expression plasmid in 6-well culture plates. Utilizing a Zeiss Axioplan 2iE photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence, subcellular localization of NFATc1-GFP fluorescence was monitored in response to hypoxia (1% O2 for 16 h) and in the presence of CnA*. Each well was divided into four quadrants, and photomicrography of each quadrant was achieved using this microscope and a Zeiss Axiocam digital charge-coupled device grayscale camera interfaced with a Macintosh G4 computer. Images were captured using Openlab 4.0.1 acquisition and analysis software (Improvision Inc.). In each quadrant, the number of GFP-positive nuclei was divided by the total number of GFP-positive cells. This value represented the percentage of cells in that quadrant in which NFAT had translocated into the nucleus. The nuclei were identified by Hoechst staining. The final quantification for each well was the average value obtained from the four quadrants, and the experiment was repeated in triplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To discern the authenticity of the AP-1 binding site within the Cygb promoter region, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was undertaken with double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved ARE site at –432. The assay was performed as described previously (18Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell.. 1998; 93: 215-228Google Scholar, 22Chaturvedi M.M. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol... 2000; 319: 585-602Google Scholar, 25Oka T. Dai Y.S. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2005; 25: 6649-6659Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates were harvested from normoxic and hypoxic C2C12 myoblasts and cells overexpressing CnA* with and without CsA. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described (22Chaturvedi M.M. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol... 2000; 319: 585-602Google Scholar, 25Oka T. Dai Y.S. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2005; 25: 6649-6659Google Scholar). The sequences for the probes were as follows: wild-type (WT) AP-1 probe, 5′-CTTCTCCGCGTGACCCCCTGATCCT-3′; mutated AP-1 probe, 5′-CTTCTCCGCGAAAACCCCTGATCCT-3′. The 32P-labeled probe was mixed with 10 μg of nuclear protein extract in 2 μl of 10× binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 4 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol). To this mixture was added 2 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and 1 μl of 1 μg/μl poly(dI:dC). The final volume was 20 μl, and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. The reaction products were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h and then exposed to radiographic film. Cold competition was carried out in the presence of a 10× molar excess of unlabeled probe, and for the supershift reactions, the nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-c-Jun and anti-c-Fos sera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 30 min prior to initiation of the binding reaction. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Cell lysates were harvested from normoxic and hypoxic C2C12 myoblasts and C2C12 cells overexpressing CnA*. Utilizing the ChIP Kit-M (Progeneron), a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was undertaken to evaluate the physical interaction among AP-1, NFAT, and the endogenous 5′ upstream fragment of the putative Cygb promoter region within the experimental groups. Immunoprecipitation of the AP-1 complex with the endogenous Cygb promoter fragment was performed using polyclonal rabbit anti-c-Jun and anti-c-Fos sera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and immunoprecipitation of NFAT with the Cygb promoter was performed using the polyclonal rabbit anti-NFATc1 serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Quantitative RT-PCR was utilized to assess the -fold enrichment of the immunoprecipitated protein-DNA complex for AP-1 and NFAT. Primers were designed to span the 5′ upstream region of the Cygb gene that included the AP-1 binding motif but did not include either the HRE or the NRE. The amplicon produced was 224 bp in length. The primer set used in the ChIP assay was as follows: forward primer, 5′-CACACGTCGAGAGCTGAGAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTGGCAAGGTGAAGGTTAGG-3′. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection System (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (21Mammen P.P. Shelton J.M. Goetsch S.C. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Garry M.G. Garry D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem... 2002; 50: 1591-1598Google Scholar). Signals were normalized to control samples processed from mock immunoprecipitation without the AP-1 or NFAT antibodies. Normalization was performed according to the ΔΔCt method (21Mammen P.P.

In addition, control primers (forward primer, 5′-GCTATGAGGAATGGCTGCAT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTGAGCAGGTCACAACAGGC-3′), which amplified a 200-bp noncoding region on murine chromosome 13, was used as a control reaction to address the specificity of the immunoprecipitated protein-DNA complex for AP-1 or NFAT. Dominant Negative Constructs and Assessment of Endogenous Cytoglobin Transcript Levels—A dominant negative plasmid recognizing the hypoxia-responsive element (dnHIF-1) was a gift from Dr. Joseph Garcia (UTSW). In addition, dominant negative constructs for NFAT (dnNFAT) and c-Jun (TAM67) were generously provided by Drs. Leon DeWindt (University Medical Center Utrecht), and Michael Birrer (NCI, National Institutes of Health), respectively. These CMV-driven expression vectors (dnHIF-1, dnNFAT, TAM67) have previously been reported to efficiently inhibit the activity of all HIF isoforms, all NFAT isoforms, and AP-1, respectively (24Brown P.H.

After exposure to 16 h of normoxia or hypoxia, the cells were harvested, RNA extracted, and cDNA made as described previously (7Mammen P.P. Shelton J.M. Ye Q. Kanatous S.B. McGrath A.J.

Assessment of endogenous Cygb transcript levels in these cell extracts was performed by qRT-PCR as described above and in previous reports (21Mammen P.P. Shelton J.M. Goetsch S.C. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Garry M.G. Garry D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem... 2002; 50: 1591-1598Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were reported as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by performing a two-tailed Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance between groups with a Bonferroni's post-test analysis. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that Cygb transcript is expressed in a variety of adult tissues and is most abundant in the whole heart and brain (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the expression of Cygb changes in response to cardiac hypoxia, WT mice were exposed to chronic hypoxia (10% O2 for 2 weeks). We have shown previously that this in vivo model of chronic hypoxia produces a significant polycythemic response and the induction of angiogenesis within the myocardium, indicative of an adaptive response to hypoxia (20Mammen P.P.

Exposure to such a stress resulted in the development of significant right and left ventricular hypertrophy in the hypoxic heart compared with the normoxic heart (Fig. 1, B and C). The magnitude of the increase in the heart-to-body weight ratio in hypoxic hearts compared with normoxic hearts was 1.6. Despite the development of significant amount of hypertrophy, we did not observe any fibrosis in the hypoxia-induced hypertrophic heart (data not shown). Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analys"
https://openalex.org/W2051717975,"The Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) is an adaptor for relaying apoptotic signals initiated by death receptors such as Fas. Whereas a lack of death receptors has no effect on mouse development, FADD deficiency results in early embryonic lethality, indicating that FADD has additional functions independent of death receptors. We have previously shown that conditional deletion of FADD not only impairs apoptosis but also leads to defective lymphocyte proliferation. The non-apoptotic signaling mediated by FADD remains poorly understood. Earlier studies have suggested that FADD carboxyl terminal serine phosphorylation likely plays a role in FADD-mediated proliferation signaling in T cells. The FADD death domain is presumably only required for apoptotic signaling, as it interacts with death receptors which are dispensable during embryonic development and lymphocyte proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we have performed mutational analyses of the FADD death domain and identified a mutant, R117Q, which lacks binding to Fas and, thus, is incapable of apoptotic signaling in cell lines. Unexpectedly, this death domain point mutation disrupted mouse embryonic development as shown by in vivo functional reconstitution analyses. Interestingly, a second FADD death domain mutant, V121N, retained normal Fas binding and apoptotic signaling ability but also failed to support mouse development. Furthermore, lymphocyte proliferation responses were impaired by V121N. This reverse genetic study has revealed a previously unappreciated role of the FADD death domain, which likely functions as a molecular switch regulating two distinct signals leading to apoptosis and cell proliferation and is critical for embryogenesis, lymphocyte development, and proliferation.

Amino acid replacements targeted at the DD, a stretch of about 80 amino acids within the intracellular sequences of Fas and TNF-R1, abrogate cell death signaling induced by these two DRs. Sequence homology searches led to the identification of additional members of the DR family, including DR3, DR4 (TRAIL-R1), DR5 (TRAIL-R2), and DR6, which also contain an intracellular DD.

Although there is a better understanding of the FADD-mediated apoptosis pathway, very little is known regarding the signaling intermediates and pathways involving FADD in cell proliferation and mouse development. The diverse functions of FADD are likely mediated by its selective interaction with distinct protein partners, including novel ones yet to be identified. We are interested in dissecting the functional domains in FADD that mediate distinct pathways required for animal development, cell death, and proliferation. In addition to the DD and DED, a functional motif of FADD was proposed to contain a phosphorylated serine residue (Ser-191) at the carboxyl terminus which may play a role in lymphocyte proliferation responses (48Hua Z.C. Sohn S.J. Kang C. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 513-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The DD of FADD is clearly essential for apoptosis, as it interacts with the DD of DRs directly or through the TRADD adaptor protein. Structural analyses indicate that the DD of FADD consists of six anti-parallel α-helices, similar to the structure of the DD of Fas (49Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J. Biol.

An initial analysis indicated that a putative Fas binding surface involves six amino acid residues within α-helices two and three of the FADD DD (49Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Later, additional residues in α-helices 1, 4, 5, and 6 in the DD of FADD were reportedly involved in mediating binding to Fas (53Hill J.M. Morisawa G. Kim T. Huang T. Wei Y. Wei Y. Werner M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1474-1481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To delineate the functional domains of FADD, we have generated mouse FADD DD mutants and performed protein-protein interaction assays in yeast cells and in FADD-deficient (FADD–/–) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Functional reconstitution analyses were performed by transgenic expression of FADD DD mutants in FADD–/– mice. Taken together, our data from these reverse genetic studies demonstrated that in addition to a role in apoptosis mediated by DRs, the DD of FADD has a non-apoptotic function in vivo which is essential for embryonic development and lymphocyte proliferation. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Retrovirus-mediated Gene Expression in FADD–/– Cells-Mutagenesis was performed on a full-length murine FADD cDNA cloned in pSP72 using the QuikChange II kit (Stratagene). The mutant FADD cDNAs were then subcloned into a murine stem cell virus-based CMV-IRES-GFP vector (provided by Dr. W. Sha, University of California at Berkeley). Procedures for the recombinant virus packaging in the 293T cell line and the subsequent mutant protein expression via retroviral transduction in FADD–/– MEFs were performed as previously described (21Imtiyaz H.Z. Zhang Y. Zhang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31360-31367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cell Death Assays-FADD–/– MEFs reconstituted with wild type and mutant FADD were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 IU/ml penicillin. MEFs were re-seeded into 96-well plates (1.5 × 104 cells per well) in triplicate in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C for 10 h (about 70% confluence). To induce apoptosis, Jo2 anti-Fas antibodies (1 μg/ml, Pharmingen) and cycloheximide (1 μg/ml, Sigma) were added to each well. After 16 h cell death was determined by propidium iodide uptake assays using a flow cytometer (Coulter EPICS XL) as previously described (16Zhang J. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2756-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell death was induced by a 16-h treatment with mouse recombinant TNFα (100 ng/ml, Genzyme Corp.) and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and analyzed by propidium iodide uptake assays. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting-FADD–/– MEFs (3 × 107) expressing either the wild type or mutant FADD were detached from culture plates by trypsinization and were resuspended in 5 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were incubated with Jo2 anti-Fas antibodies (10 μg, Pharmingen) for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugal removal of cell debris, additional anti-Fas antibodies were added (1 μg) to the supernatant, and protein complexes were precipitated using protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) by rotational mixing at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads coupled with protein complex were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling in a standard sample buffer for 3 min and fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE. FADD and caspase 8 associated with Fas were detected with polyclonal anti-FADD antibodies or monoclonal anti-caspase 8 antibodies (1G12, Alexis) by Western blotting procedure. Genomic Reconstitution of FADD–/– mice-The 12-kb FADD:GFP wild type fusion minigene and the FADD–/– FADD:GFP mice were generated in a previous study (35Zhang Y. Rosenberg S. Wang H. Imtiyaz H.Z. Hou Y.J. Zhang J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To generate the R117Q:GFP and V121N:GFP constructs, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on a 1-kb XhoI fragment containing exon 2 of FADD. The R117Q and V121N mutant fragments were used to replace the 1-kb XhoI fragment on the wild type FADD:GFP minigene construct. The resulting R117Q:GFP and V121N:GFP constructs were injected into wild type C57BL/6 mouse embryos to produce FADD+/+ R117Q:GFP, and FADD+/+ V121N:GFP mice. These mice were then crossed with heterozygous FADD knock-out (FADD+/–) mice, and the resulting FADD+/– R117Q:GFP and FADD+/– V121N:GFP mice were backcrossed with FADD+/– mice to obtain FADD–/– R117Q:GFP and FADD–/– V121N:GFP mice. Offspring were genotyped by Southern blots using genomic DNA isolated from tails. All animal studies were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Thomas Jefferson University. Embryo Study-Timed mating was performed on crosses between heterozygous FADD knock-out (FADD+/–) mice and FADD+/– R117Q:GFP or FADD+/– V121N:GFP mice. Embryos were isolated at embryonic days 10.5–15.5. Gross morphology was recorded using a stereomicroscope. Genotyping was performed by Southern blotting and PCR using genomic DNA extracted from embryos. Transgene expression was examined by Western blotting using whole cell extract prepared from embryonic tissues. Fetal Liver Cell Adoptive Transfer-Timed mating was set up as described above. At embryonic days 12.5–15.5, pregnant mice were dissected to surgically remove the uterus. Embryos were isolated using a dissecting microscope. After surgical removal, the fetal liver was disintegrated by pipetting in 1 ml of PBS, and cells were filtered through 50 μm mesh. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in freezing medium (7% DMSO in fetal bovine serum) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA was extracted from embryo tissues and used for PCR genotyping as described (35Zhang Y. Rosenberg S. Wang H. Imtiyaz H.Z. Hou Y.J. Zhang J. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Proteins were extracted from embryo tissues by 6 passages through a 23-gauge needle in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem), with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin (Roche Applied Science), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The extracts were subjected to SDS/PAGE, and Western blotting was performed using anti-FADD polyclonal antibodies. After genotypes were determined by PCR or the FADD protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting, fetal liver cells were thawed by incubating at 37 °C for 3 min, immediately re-suspended in PBS, and washed once with PBS. One million fetal liver cells were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and transferred by tail vein or retroorbital injection into NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (NOG, 005557; The Jackson Laboratory) after 200 RAD irradiation as shown previously (54Kambe N. Hiramatsu H. Shimonaka M. Fujino H. Nishikomori R. Heike T. Ito M. Kobayashi K. Ueyama Y. Matsuyoshi N. Miyachi Y. Nakahata T. Blood. 2004; 103: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The resulting chimeras were analyzed 8–14 weeks post-transfer. Lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis assays were performed as previously described (34Imtiyaz H.Z. Rosenberg S. Zhang Y. Rahman Z.S.

Mutational Analysis of the Death Domain of FADD-We initially sought to identify FADD mutants with selective loss of function to help define the functional domains of FADD. The DD of FADD had previously been targeted for site-directed mutagenesis, as it mediates binding to Fas or TRADD. Cross-species sequence alignments of the FADD DD revealed amino acid residues that are highly conserved from flies to humans (Fig. 1A). It has been indicated that several residues localized within α-helices 2 and 3 of the DD of FADD, as highlighted in Fig. 1A, are involved in mediating FADD binding to Fas and TRADD (49Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have performed yeast two hybrid assays and functional reconstitution analyses using FADD-deficient (FADD–/–) MEF cells and found that mutations at one particular residue, Arg-117, disrupted FADD-Fas and FADD-TRADD interactions and resulted in defective apoptosis induced by Fas or TNFα (21Imtiyaz H.Z. Zhang Y. Zhang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31360-31367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An expanded Fas binding surface in the DD of FADD was proposed, suggesting that residues including Lys-125, Arg-142, Lys-146, Arg-166, and Asp175 in α-helices 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the DD of FADD were involved in binding of FADD to Fas (Fig. 1A) (53Hill J.M. Morisawa G. Kim T. Huang T. Wei Y. Wei Y. Werner M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1474-1481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the current study we performed additional site-directed mutagenesis of the DD of FADD, substituting each of the abovementioned residues with the indicated residues (Fig. 1, A and B). In functional reconstitution assays, the resulting full-length K125A, R142A, K146A, R166E, and D175R FADD mutants were expressed in FADD–/– MEFs lacking the endogenous FADD to determine whether their ability in mediating apoptosis induced by Fas and TNF was affected. To avoid potential side effects caused by transient overexpression, we employed retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to stably express the wild type and the mutant FADD proteins. The wild type FADD WT cDNA was expressed stably in FADD–/– MEFs lacking the endogenous FADD and used as a control (Fig. 1B). FADD–/– MEFs containing the cloning vector were used as the FADD-negative control. To induce apoptosis, reconstituted MEFs were treated with an agonistic anti-Fas antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, FADD–/– control MEFs infected with the retroviral vector were highly resistant to this treatment, whereas FADD WT control MEFs underwent extensive death (∼80%) at 16 h after stimulation with anti-Fas antibodies. Interestingly, MEFs expressing K125A, R142A, K146A, R166E, and D175R mutants of FADD can be killed as efficiently as the FADD WT control by anti-Fas antibodies (left, Fig. 1B). When treated with TNFα, there was 80–90% cell death in MEFs reconstituted with each of the five mutants of FADD, which is similar to cell death induced in the FADD WT control (right, Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the K125A, R142A, K146A, R166E, and D175R mutations of the DD of FADD have no major effect on apoptosis induced by Fas or TNF. We previously showed that the R117A mutant of FADD is not capable of binding to Fas or TRADD and cannot mediate apoptosis induced by Fas or TNFα (21Imtiyaz H.Z. Zhang Y. Zhang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31360-31367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study a second mutation was introduced into FADD to replace Arg-117 with glutamine, which has a side chain structure similar to that of arginine. The resulting R117Q mutant was stably expressed in FADD–/– MEFs. Like the R117A mutant, R117Q is not functional in mediating apoptosis induced by Fas or TNFα (Fig. 2A). Apoptotic signal-specific protein interaction was determined by co-immunoprecipitation analyses. The Fas binding ability of FADD was diminished dramatically by the R117A or R117Q mutations (Fig. 2B). As expected, signal-specific recruitment of caspase 8 was also disrupted by the R117A and R117Q mutations. Expression of the FADD DD Mutant Proteins in Mice-To perform in vivo analyses of FADD mutants, we employed a 12-kb minigene containing the wild type mouse FADD gene exon 1 coding for the DED and exon 2 coding for the DD of FADD (FADD WT; Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2029976406,"Tollip is an interactor of the interleukin-1 receptor involved in its activation. The endosomal turnover of ubiquitylated IL-1RI is also controlled by Tollip. Furthermore, together with Tom1, Tollip has a general role in endosomal protein traffic. This work shows that Tollip is involved in the sumoylation process. Using the yeast two-hybrid technique, we have isolated new Tollip partners including two sumoylation enzymes, SUMO-1 and the transcriptional repressor Daxx. The interactions were confirmed by GST-pull down experiments and immunoprecipitation of the co-expressed recombinants. More specifically, we show that the TIR domain of the cytoplasmic region of IL-1RI is a sumoylation target of Tollip. The sumoylated and unsumoylated RanGAP-1 protein also interacts with Tollip, suggesting a possible role in RanGAP-1 modification and nuclear-cytoplasmic protein translocation. In fact, Tollip is found in the nuclear bodies of SAOS-2/IL-1RI cells where it colocalizes with SUMO-1 and the Daxx repressor. We conclude that Tollip is involved in the control of both nuclear and cytoplasmic protein traffic, through two different and often contrasting processes: ubiquitylation and sumoylation."
https://openalex.org/W2005139401,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) accumulates when tumors grow under hypoxic conditions. The genesis of tumors, however, usually involves normoxic conditions. In this study, we were interested in examining the potential role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)/HIF-1β in tumor growth under normoxic conditions, specifically when cells are treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is known to affect the gene expression of tumor growth-related protein COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2). The results showed that EGF receptor inhibitor, AG1478, abolished EGF-induced nuclear accumulation of ARNT as well as the expression of COX-2. ARNT small interfering RNA inhibited the promoter activity, mRNA level, and protein expression of COX-2 in cells treated with EGF. In contrast, CoCl2-induced HIF-1α exhibited no effect on COX-2 expression. EGF also stimulated the formation of the ARNT·c-Jun complex as well as the complex binding to the COX-2 promoter. ARNT small interfering RNAs blocked EGF-activated cell migration. Moreover, COX-2 and ARNT were cohorts present distinctively in clinical specimens of human cervical squamous cell carcinoma and were almost nondetectable in adjacent normal or noncancerous cervical tissues. Our results revealed that ARNT plays an important role in EGF-regulated COX-2 gene expression and may thus be related to either a cause or a consequence of tumorigenesis in cervical cancer.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) 3The abbreviations used are: ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; bHLH-PAS, basic helix-loop-helix Per/AhR/ARNT/Sim; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREm, site-directed mutagenesis at CRE; siRNA, small interfering RNA. (also known as HIF-1β (hypoxia-inducible factor-1β)) is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix Per/aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)/ARNT/Sim (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors and a general partner factor for bHLH-PAS proteins such as the AhR, HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor-1α), and single-minded (SIM) proteins (1Kewley R.J. Whitelaw M.L. Chapman-Smith A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Although the in vivo importance of ARNT homodimers remains unclear, each of the heterodimeric ARNT-containing complexes plays a critical function in pathways used to respond to environmental conditions. As in exposure to xenobiotic compounds, the AhR/ARNT heterodimer recognizes and promotes transcription from xenobiotic response elements found upstream of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-responsive genes (1Kewley R.J. Whitelaw M.L. Chapman-Smith A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). ARNT also cooperates with HIF-1α to form a heterodimer and regulates several genes involved in tumorigenesis under hypoxia (2Giaccia A. Siim B.G. Johnson R.S. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition, ARNT is essential for normal embryonic development (3Kozak K.R. Abbott B. Hankinson O. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Loss of ARNT results in reduced tumor growth, decreased angiogenesis, and increased response to radiotherapy (4Maltepe E.

Inactivation of ARNT suppresses the development of liver hemangioma, polycythemia, and HIF-induced gene expression. Unlike ARNT, however, HIF-1α is insufficient to suppress the development of the Von Hippel-Lindau-associated polychthemia (6Rankin E.B. Higgins D.F. Walisser J.A. Johnson R.S. Bradfield C.A. Haase V.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3163-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the development of Von Hippel-Lindau-associated vascular tumors in the liver depends on functional ARNT but not in an HIF-1α/hypoxia-dependent manner.Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase, also known as cyclooxygenase, plays a regulatory role in the conversion of arachidonic acid to inflammatory prostaglandins (7Chandrasekharan N.V. Simmons D. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 241Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It is well documented that COX-2 expression contributes to increased antiapoptotic, proangiogenic, and metastatic potential in cancer cells, and COX-2 deregulation is correlated with tumor progression (8Turini M.E.

Brandt R. Ciardiello F. Normanno N. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 183-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). Activation of EGFR signaling pathways has many effects, including increased proliferation and angiogenesis and decreased apoptosis (18Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5538) Google Scholar). Activation of EGFR signaling leads to increased mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, resulting in AP-1-mediated induction of COX-2 transcription (13Subbaramaiah K. Norton L. Gerald W.

In preclinical studies, combining an inhibitor of COX-2 with an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase was more effective than either agent alone in suppressing tumor formation (21Torrance C.J.

In clinical studies, synchronous coexpression of EGFR and COX-2 has been demonstrated in carcinomas of the uterine cervix; the strong coexpression indicates a potential predictor of poor survival (22Kim G.E. Kim Y.B. Cho N.H. Chung H-C. Pyo H.R. Lee J.D. Park T.J. Koom W.S. Chun M. Suh C.O. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 1366-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). So far, dual blockage of EGFR and COX-2 in head and neck cancer and in lung cancer has been investigated in clinical trials (23Wirth L.J. Haddad R.I. Lindeman N.I. Zhao X. Lee J.C. Joshi V.A.

Chen B.K. Chang W.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 2057-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our results suggest a model in which c-Jun expression, induced by EGF, could recruit either c-Fos or other transcription factors to the promoter and regulate gene expression of COX-2. In order to identify factors involved in the regulation of EGF-induced COX-2 expression, factors bound to the CRE site of the COX-2 promoter were analyzed by a DNA affinity precipitation assay. The bound proteins were subsequently analyzed by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Proteins on the gel were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. ARNT, which was one of the proteins bound to the probe, was clearly identified. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that EGF-induced COX-2 expression was mediated by accumulation of ARNT in the nucleus, resulting in a complex formation of c-Jun·ARNT. Coexpression of COX-2 and ARNT was found clinically in human cervical cancer tissue. These results provide the new regulatory mechanism of HIF-1 factor involved in growth factor-induced gene expression under normoxia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture-The cell line of human squamous cell carcinoma (A431) was grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in 10-cm plastic dishes containing 10 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. In this series of experiments, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml EGF (Pepro Technology, Rocky Hill, NJ) in culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, unless stated otherwise. The cell line of human cervical cancer, SiHa, and oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, OEC-M1, were also grown in same manner but with different media, including Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and RPMI 1640, respectively, together with the supplement of 10% fetal bovine serum.Immunofluorescence-Cells were seeded onto glass slides overnight and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 7 min. Next, the cells were pretreated with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C for 60 min and incubated with rabbit anti-ARNT polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h and treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at a dilution of 1:250 for 1 h. Finally, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted in 90% glycerol containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen), and examined by using a microscope (model DMI 4000 B; Leica).Plasmid Construction-ARNT cDNA fragments were generated by PCR and were subcloned into pcDNA3.1myc/His vector (Invitrogen) at the BamHI and EcoRV sites. The forward and reverse primers were 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCGGCGACTACTG-3′ and 5′-CGGATATCTTCTGAAAAGGGGGGAAAC-3′, respectively. The vector sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Transfection of Cells with Plasmids and Luciferase Assay-Luciferase vectors bearing various lengths or mutants of the COX-2 gene promoter were used (14Chen L-C. Chen B-K. Chang J-M. Chang W-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1683: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of cells with plasmids was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions but with slight modifications. A431 cells were replated 36 h before transfection at a density of 3 × 105 cells in 2 ml of fresh culture medium in a 3.5-cm plastic dish. For use in transfection, 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 was incubated with 0.5 μg of pXC luciferase plasmid, ARNT siRNA, or scramble siRNA (Invitrogen) and plasmids, where indicated, such as Myc-ARNT in 1 ml of Opti-MEM medium for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were transfected by changing the medium with 1 ml of Opti-MEM medium containing the plasmids and Lipofectamine 2000 and then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 24 h. Following the change of Opti-MEM medium to 2 ml of fresh culture medium, cells were incubated further for an additional 24 h unless stated otherwise. The luciferase activity in cell lysate was determined as described previously (26Liu Y.W. Arakawa T. Yamamoto S. Chang W.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Reverse Transcription-PCR-Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol RNA extraction kit (Invitrogen), and 5 μg of RNA was subjected to reverse transcription-PCR with SuperScript™II (Invitrogen). The COX-2-specific primers (sense, 5′-CCCACTTCAAGGGATTTT-3′; antisense, 5′-CCAGACCAAAGACCTCCT-3′), ARNT-specific primers (sense, 5′-TGGGTCCAGCCATTGCCTCT-3′; antisense, 5′-CGAGCCAGGGCACTACAGGT-3′), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were used. The PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide staining.Western Blotting-The cytoplasmic fractions and nuclear extracts of cells were prepared for Western blot analysis according to the method described (27Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). An analytical 10% SDS-PAGE was performed, and 30 μg of protein of each was analyzed, unless stated otherwise. For immunoblotting, proteins in the SDS gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by an electroblot apparatus. Antibodies against human HIF-1α (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), COX-2 (Lab Vision Corp. (Fremont, CA) and Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI)), ARNT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as the primary antibodies. Mouse or rabbit IgG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were used as secondary antibodies. An enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) was used for detection.Coimmunoprecipitation-A total of 200 μg of protein of nuclear extracts and lysate was incubated under gentle shaking at 4 °C overnight with a mixture of anti-c-Jun or anti-ARNT antibodies and protein A-agarose in 300 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Beads were pelleted at 7500 × g for 2 min and washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (v/v), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). Protein was removed from the beads by boiling in sample buffer (120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 3% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4% bromphenol blue) for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Western blot analysis was carried out as described above.DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay-Quantitation of the change of c-Jun and ARNT binding to the COX-2 promoter element was achieved by a DNA affinity precipitation assay according to the method previously described (28Zhu Y. Saunders M.A. Yeh H. Deng W-G. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6923-6928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In brief, 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotides and corresponding to the sense –67 to –42 bp and antisense strands of the COX-2 promoter element were annealed. The DNA affinity precipitation assay was performed by incubating 2 μg of biotinylated DNA probe with 200 μg of nuclear extract and 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h with rotation. Beads were collected and washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The binding proteins were eluted by loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis probed with specific antibodies.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay-A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as previously reported (29Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, A431 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. The cross-linked chromatin was sonicated to 400–500 bp fragments. Lysates were precleaned with protein A beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies specific to ARNT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or control rabbit IgG. Immune complex was precipitated with protein A beads preabsorbed with sonicated single-stranded DNA and bovine serum albumin. After reversal of cross-linking, levels of precipitated COX-2 promoter DNA were determined by PCR using oligonucleotides spanning the CRE binding sites (sense, 5′-CTGGGTTTCCGATTTTCTCA-3′; antisense, 5′-GAGTTCCTGGACGTGCTCCT-3′). The PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide staining.Transwell Migration and Wound Healing Assay-A431 cells were transfected with 50 nm ARNT siRNA or scramble oligonucleotides by lipofection. The cells were trypsinized, and 2 × 105 cells were added to the Boyden chambers (8-μm pore size; Millipore, Bedford, MA), and assay media with or without EGF was added to the culture plates. After EGF treatment for 15 h, the nonmotile cells at the top of the filter were removed, and the motile cells at the bottom of the filter were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with a one-tenth dilution of Giemsa (Sigma). The number of migrating cells in each chamber was quantified by counting four fields. For wound healing assay, cells were transfected with 50 nm ARNT siRNA or scramble oligonucleotides by lipofection. After the cell layer reached confluence, a wound was made with a pipette tip, followed by extensive washing with serum-free medium to remove cell debris. Cells were then cultured as described under “Cell Culture,” treated with 50 ng/ml EGF and 10 μm PGE2, and allowed to migrate into the wound area for up to 60 h. The extent of wound closure was observed by using a phase-contrast microscope camera (model DMI 4000 B; Leica).Surgical Specimens of Cervical Cancer-From January 1999 to December 2000, 100 consecutive patients with carcinoma of uterine cervix were scheduled for radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy at National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Taiwan. The clinical staging and histological classifications were based on the criteria of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics and the World Health Organization, respectively. Patients who had undergone conization of the cervix before radical hysterectomy and who had histopathology of squamous cell carcinoma were included in this study. For immunofluorescent stainings, sections of surgical specimens were stained with polyclonal antibodies against ARNT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and monoclonal antibody against COX-2 (Cayman), followed by exposure to Alexa 488-labeled or Alexa 594-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and by Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). At least five sections from each patient’s specimen were analyzed for histology, ARNT, and COX-2 expression. Each section was examined blindly by two investigators trained in cervical pathology. ARNT and COX-2 staining were evaluated manually or by image analysis with the use of a CoolSnap-Pro color digital camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) and Image-Pro Plus 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) over 15–20 high power fields. The intensity and distribution of immunofluorescent stains of ARNT and COX-2 were graded using a scale of I–III in each specimen. At least 500 tumor cells were analyzed in each case, and the grade of stained tumor cells was recorded. For ARNT staining, tumors were considered grade III if more than 30% of the cells showed distinct strong nuclear stainings. Tumors were considered grade I of ARNT staining if fewer than 5% of the cells showed distinct nuclear stainings. For COX-2 staining, grade I indicates that COX-2 staining intensity and distribution are less than one-third of the tumor area. Grade II indicates that the staining intensity and distribution are greater than one-third but less than two-thirds of the tumor area. Grade III indicates that the staining intensity and distribution are greater than two-thirds of the tumor area.RESULTSARNT Translocates into Nucleus in EGF-treated A431 Cells-Since ARNT was clearly identified in the binding to COX-2 promoter (as shown in Fig. 4C), we then examined whether HIF-1, a HIF-1α/ARNT heterodimer, was involved in EGF-activated signaling pathways, resulting in the regulation of COX-2 expression. We first tested the effect of EGF on HIF-1α protein expression in A431 cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, HIF-1α was barely detectable in EGF-treated cells. On the other hand, a hypoxia-mimetic agent, CoCl2, could induce HIF-1α protein expression in a time-dependent manner. Both EGF and CoCl2 induced c-Jun expression but showed no effect on ARNT expression (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, although ARNT predominantly existed in the nucleus, EGF enhanced the accumulation of ARNT in the nucleus (Fig. 1, B and C); the accumulation of ARNT in the nucleus was abolished by the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478 (Fig. 1D). Correlating with the decreased ARNT level caused by AG1478 in the nucleus, EGF-induced COX-2 expression was inhibited (Fig. 1D). In addition, EGF also stimulated the phosphorylation of ARNT (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that EGF induced the accumulation of ARNT in the nucleus but had no effect on the HIF-1α expression. The phospho-ARNT induced by EGF may account for the ARNT accumulation in the nucleus.FIGURE 1Effect of EGF on HIF expression and translocation. A, cells were starved for 18 h in serum-free culture medium and then treated with 50 ng/ml EGF for 4 h or with 1 mm CoCl2 for various time periods (as indicated) in the culture medium without serum. Lysates of cells were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against HIF-1α, ARNT, c-Jun, and β-actin. B, cells were treated with 50 ng/ml EGF for 4 h, fixed by using 4% paraformaldehyde, labeled with rabbit anti-ARNT antibodies, and then stained with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. DNA was stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Finally, the cells were examined using a microscope. C, cells were starved and then treated with 50 ng/ml EGF for various time periods (as indicated) in the culture medium without serum. Cytoplasmic fraction (CP) and nuclear extracts (NE) of cells were prepared in the same volume of buffer, and an aliquot of each fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against ARNT and c-Jun. D, cells were starved and then treated with 5 nm AG1478 for 30 min, followed by EGF treatment for 4 h. Nuclear extracts, cytoplasmic fraction, and lysates of cells (LS) were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for ARNT and COX-2. E, cellular lysates of cells were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies against ARNT bound to protein A-agarose.

Chen B-K. Chang J-M. Chang W-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1683: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of ARNT on the transcriptional activation by the reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, overexpression of ARNT induced the promoter activity of COX-2. The ARNT-induced promoter activity was also enhanced by EGF. In order to confirm the functional role of endogenous ARNT in regulating the EGF-induced COX-2 expression, ARNT short interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide was transfected into A431 cells. The EGF-induced promoter activity, mRNA, and protein were all attenuated in those cells with decreased level of ARNT (Fig. 2, B and D). The inhibition of ARNT siRNA was further confirmed by using different sets of siRNA oligonucleotides (Fig. S1). In addition, the expression of EGF-induced c-Jun was not altered in ARNT knockdown cells (Fig. 2D). These results revealed that ARNT was involved in the regulation of EGF-induced COX-2 gene expression in normoxic conditions.FIGURE 2Effect of ARNT on EGF-induced gene expression of COX-2.

Cells were transfected with pXC918 and ARNT expression vector by lipofection. Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml EGF and further cultured in fresh medium up to 6 h. The luciferase activities and protein concentrations were then determined and normalized. Values represent means ± S.E. of three determinations. B, cells were transfected with pXC918 and various amounts of ARNT siRNA oligonucleotides by lipofection. After EGF treatment for 6 h, the luciferase activities and protein concentrations were determined and normalized. Values represent means ± S.E. of three determinations. Expressions of ARNT and β-actin proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-ARNT and anti-β-actin antibodies, respectively. C, cells were transfected with 50 nm ARNT siRNA or scramble oligonucleotides by lipofection. After EGF treatment for 6 h, total RNA was extracted for reverse transcription PCR with COX-2, ARNT, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers.

The relative density of COX-2 protein was quantified as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)COX-2 Promoter Analysis for ARNT Responses-We then studied which binding site of the COX-2 promoter is responsible for the effect of ARNT on the induction of promoter activity. The 5′-deletion constructs of the COX-2 promoter were used. The results are summarized in Fig. 3A. A 30% decrease in the stimulatory response to ARNT transfection was observed in vectors bearing a promoter with a deletion from –918 to –422 bp (pXC918 to pXC422), indicating that a putative HRE site-containing region and a Sp1 site may play a partial role in the ARNT-induced promoter activity of COX-2. Compared with the stimulatory response of ARNT in pXC250 vector, a 50% decrease of the response was observed from pXC250 to pXC80. There was still about a 5-fold induction observed in vector pXC80. These results indicate that the promoter region, containing HRE, Sp1, NF-IL6, and CRE sites, etc., in the regions from –918 to –422 bp (pXC918 to pXC422), –250 to –80 bp (pXC250 to pXC80), and –80 to +49 bp ("
https://openalex.org/W2088057985,"The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is widely expressed in neural and non-neural tissues, but its function is unknown. Elucidation of the part played by PrP(C) in adaptive immunity has been a particular conundrum: increased expression of cell surface PrP(C) has been documented during T-cell activation, yet the functional significance of this activation remains unclear, with conflicting data on the effects of Prnp gene knockout on various parameters of T-cell immunity. We show here that Prnp mRNA is highly inducible within 8-24 h of T-cell activation, with surface protein levels rising from 24 h. When measured in parallel with CD69 and CD25, PrP(C) is a late activation antigen. Consistent with its up-regulation being a late activation event, PrP deletion did not alter T-cell-antigen presenting cell conjugate formation. Most important, activated PrP(0/0) T cells demonstrated much reduced induction of several T helper (Th) 1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines, whereas others, such as TNF-alpha and IL-9, were unaffected. These changes were investigated in the context of an autoimmune model and a bacterial challenge model. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, PrP-knockout mice showed enhanced disease in the face of reduced IL-17 responses. In a streptococcal sepsis model, this constrained cytokine program was associated with poorer local control of infection, although with reduced bacteremia. The findings indicate that PrP(C) is a potentially important molecule influencing T-cell activation and effector function."
https://openalex.org/W2077200841,"GAT-1 is a sodium- and chloride-coupled γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter, which fulfills an essential role in the synaptic transmission by this neurotransmitter. Cysteine-399 is the major site of inhibition of GAT-1 by membrane-permeant sulfhydryl reagents. This cysteine residue was previously thought to reside on a cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane domains (TMs) 8 and 9. However, the crystal structure of LeuT, a bacterial homologue of the mammalian neurotransmitter:sodium symporters, revealed that the residue corresponding to Cys-399 is in fact located in the middle of TM 8. This residue is located to the cytoplasmic side of Asp-395 and Ser-396, whose side chains are thought to ligand one of the two cotransported sodium ions. To determine how the sulfhydryl reagents approach cysteine-399, a cysteine scan of all 35 residues of TM 8 was performed. Sulfhydryl reagents inhibited transport when a cysteine residue was present at either of the positions 399, 402, 406, and 410. SKF-89976A and other non-transportable analogues, which are expected to lock the transporter in a conformation facing the extracellular medium, protected against the sulfhydryl modification at positions 399, 402, and 406. Such a protection was not seen by GABA itself, which actually modestly potentiated the modification at positions 399 and 402.

GAT-1 belongs to the NSS family of transporters (also called SLC6). Other members of the family include the transporters for serotonin, dopamine, glycine, and norepinephrine (for reviews, see Refs. 3Nelson J.

GAT-1 catalyzes the electrogenic cotransport of sodium, chloride, and GABA with a stoichiometry of 2:1:1, respectively (5Lu C.C. Hilgemann D.W. J. Gen.

Although the precise order of events during a transport cycle is not yet established, it is clear that the uptake process is initiated by the binding of at least one sodium ion (6Mager S. Naeve J.

In accordance with the principle of alternating access during transport (11Jardetzky O. Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), the cycle is expected to consist of transitions between outward and inward facing conformations. Moreover, by analogy with the high resolution crystal structures of the bacterial homologue LeuT (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) and those of transporters from other families, which are nevertheless structurally related (13Faham S. Watanabe A.

Science. 2008; 322: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), conformations with the binding pocket occluded from both sides of the membrane are also likely to be involved in the cycle. The LeuT structure appears to be an excellent model for the NSS neurotransmitter transporters (15Zhou Y. Zomot E. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22092-22099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

LeuT consists of 12 TMs with TMs 1–5 related to TMs 6–10 by a pseudo-two-fold axis in the membrane plane. TMs 1 and 6 have breaks in their helical structure approximately halfway across the membrane. These breaks expose main-chain carbonyl oxygen and nitrogen atoms for the binding of leucine and the two sodium ions, Na1 and Na2. The sodium ions in the binding pocket are both close to the substrate, which is in direct contact, through its carboxyl group, with Na1 (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). In contrast to NSS neurotransmitter transporters, LeuT and other bacterial homologues do not require chloride for transport (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 19Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Goldberg N.R. Ueda K. Beppu T. Beckman M.L. Das S. Javitch J.A. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Recently, the chloride binding site of the NSS neurotransmitter transporters was identified. This site is located near Na1, and it appears that the role of chloride is basically to compensate for the multiple positive charges provided by the sodium ions during the neurotransmitter translocation step (21Forrest L.R. Tavoulari S. Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. Honig B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12761-12766Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22Zomot E. Bendahan A. Quick M. Zhao Y. Javitch J.A. Kanner B.I. Nature. 2007; 449: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Wild-type GAT-1 transport activity is inhibited by the membrane-permeant sulfhydryl reagents MTSEA and NEM, which react with the thiolate anion. Previously, single substitutions of all endogenous cysteines revealed that Cys-399 is the major determinant of the sensitivity of GAT-1 to these two sulfhydryl reagents (23Golovanevsky V. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23020-23026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). According to the topology based on hydropathy plots of the sequence of the cloned transporter, Cys-399 was thought to be located on a cytoplasmic loop connecting TM 8 and TM 9 (2Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). However, the LeuT structure revealed that the residue corresponding to Cys-399 is located in the middle of the membrane close to the Na2 binding site (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The approximate location of Cys-399 is indicated in the schematic topology (Fig. 1), which is based on the LeuT structure (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unclear whether the aqueous accessibility of Cys-399 to sulfhydryl reagents is from the extracellular or intracellular side of GAT-1. Because the transporter assumes outward and inward facing conformations during the transport cycle, the accessibility of Cys-399 should be influenced by transporter ligands predicted to favor either of these two conformations. Therefore, a cysteine scan of all 35 residues of TM 8 was performed. This was done in a construct where not only Cys-399 was eliminated but also the conserved Cys-74 located in the extracellular part of TM 1 (Fig. 1). This latter residue is the target for inhibition of transport by the impermeant sulfhydryl reagent (2-trimethylammonium) methanethiosulfonate (24Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Rosenberg A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14376-14383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have tested the ability of NEM and MTSEA to affect [3H]GABA transport by the cysteine mutants under conditions favoring outward and inward facing conformations of the transporter. Our results are consistent with the participation of the intracellular part of TM 8 in an aqueous pathway leading from the binding pocket into the cytoplasm. Generation and Subcloning of Mutants-Mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis of GAT-1, harboring the mutations C74A and C399A in the vector pBluescript SK– (Stratagene) using single-stranded uracil-containing DNA as described previously (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar, 27Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the GAT-1-C74A/C399A containing plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut-, ung-). From one of the transformants, single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was isolated upon growth in uridine-containing medium according to the standard protocol from Stratagene, using helper phage R408. This yields the sense strand, and consequently, mutagenic primers were designed to be antisense. The mutants were subcloned into GAT-1-C74A/C399A in the vector pBluescript SK–, using the unique restriction enzymes NheI and AgeI, and sequenced between these two restriction sites. Cell Growth and Expression-HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Infection with recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus vTF7-3 (28Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar) and subsequent transfection with plasmid DNA, as well as GABA transport, were done as published previously (29Keynan S. Suh Y.J. Kanner B.I. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1974-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The expression vector was pBluescript SK–. Inhibition Studies with Sulfhydryl Reagents-Prior to the transport assay, cells adhering to 24-well plates were washed twice with 1 ml of the transport medium containing 150 mm choline chloride instead of NaCl, except when the effect of chloride on reactivity was examined, in which case 150 mm sodium gluconate replaced NaCl. Each well was then incubated at room temperature with 200 μl of the preincubation medium (the different compositions and reagent concentrations are indicated in the figure legends) with the indicated concentrations of NEM (Sigma-Aldrich) or MTSEA (Anatrace). After 5 min, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with the same solution without sulfhydryl reagents followed by [3H]GABA transport. The concentration of the sulfhydryl reagents chosen in the different experiments was optimized according to the experimental conditions of the mutants used. For instance, in Fig. 5, different concentrations were used for different mutants because some are more sensitive than others. Statistical evaluation of the inhibition of the different mutants by NEM or MTSEA utilized a one-way analysis of variance with a post-hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, where p < 0.05 was taken as significant. Results were plotted using normalized data for each mutant, where the untreated activity levels are normalized to 100%. Cysteine-scanning Mutagenesis and Impact of NEM-GAT-1 residues 377–411 correspond to TM 8 as defined by the LeuT structure (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Cysteines were introduced one at a time into each of these positions of GAT-1-C74A/C399A, a construct in which these two endogenous cysteines were replaced by alanine. In 5 out of the 35 cysteine mutants, no measurable [3H]GABA transport could be detected (Fig. 2). These included the mutants at positions 395 and 396, which correspond to LeuT positions, which coordinate Na2 (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), and were previously shown by us to be inactive in transport (15Zhou Y. Zomot E. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22092-22099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The three other inactive mutants were G393C, G403C, and E411C. Moreover, two additional mutants, F385C and Q397C, had measurable yet very low activity, namely 3.1 ± 0.4 and 1.9 ± 0.2% of that of C74A/C399A, respectively (n = 3) (Fig. 2). The activity of the cysteine replacement mutant of the conserved Asp-410, which in the LeuT structure forms a charged pair with a conserved arginine at the cytoplasmic entrance of the transporter (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), was 8.3 ± 3.2% of C74A/C399A, which was sufficiently high to quantitatively study the effect of sulfhydryl reagents on transport activity. The activity of the other 27 mutants ranged from 16.5 to 100% of C74A/C399A (Fig. 2). Besides the mutant in which the cysteine at position 399 was restored (Cys-399; this construct bears the C74A mutation only), inhibition by the sulfhydryl reagent NEM (0.5 mm) was also observed with T406C and D410C (Fig. 3). Two other mutants, L392C and F398C, were also modified by NEM. However, instead of inhibition, the sulfhydryl reagent caused a stimulation of transport activity of these mutants (Fig. 3). When alanine instead of cysteine residues were introduced at positions 392, 398, 399, and 406, no effect of NEM on transport activity was observed (Fig. 4). This argues against the idea that the mutations caused the exposure of endogenous, previously inaccessible, cysteine residues. Rather, it appears that the introduced cysteines themselves reacted with the sulfhydryl reagent. In the case of position 410, it was impossible to assess the (lack of) effect of NEM on the alanine and serine mutants because these mutants were devoid of measurable transport activity (data not shown).FIGURE 4Effect of sulfhydryl reagents on TM 8 alanine and cysteine mutants. The indicated cysteine (filled bars) and alanine (open bars) mutants were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and the effect of preincubation with 0.5 mm NEM or of 0.75 mm MTSEA in the case of E402C on transport activity was determined as described in the legend for Fig. 3. Error bars indicate mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of GABA and SKF-89976A on Reactivity toward NEM-Positions 399, 406, and 410 are located on the intracellular part of TM8, and this suggests that the membrane-permeant NEM modifies Cys-399, T406C, and D410C from the cytoplasm. The non-transportable substrate analogue SKF-89976A is expected to “lock” GAT-1 in an outward facing conformation, thereby decreasing the aqueous accessibility from the intracellular side. Indeed, the inhibition of Cys-399 and T406C by NEM was significantly diminished in the presence of the non-transportable substrate analogue SKF-89976A (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5, A and B). A similar protection was observed with the non-transportable substrate analogue SKF-100330A, and the same was true for the analogue tiagabine, which was tested with T406C (data not shown). With Cys-399, this protection was dependent on the simultaneous presence of the co-substrates sodium and chloride (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, with T406C, a slight protection by SKF-89976A was seen even in the absence of chloride (replacement by gluconate) (p < 0.05) but not in the absence of sodium (replacement by choline) (Fig. 5B). The removal of chloride did not have much of an effect on the degree of inhibition by NEM (Fig. 5, A and B), but in the absence of sodium, a small potentiation of the inhibition was observed in Cys-399 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A). In contrast to SKF-89976A, GABA itself will be transported into the cell in the presence of external sodium and chloride, thereby increasing the proportion of inward facing transporters. In the presence of GABA, a small but significant potentiation of the inhibition by NEM was observed with Cys-399 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A), and this potentiation was only seen in the simultaneous presence of sodium and chloride (data not shown). On the other hand, GABA did not have a significant effect on the inhibition of T406C by NEM (Fig. 5B). In contrast to Cys-399 and T406C, none of the ligands had a significant effect on the inhibition of transport by NEM in D410C (Fig. 5C) or on its stimulation of transport activity in L392C (Fig. 6A) or F398C (Fig. 6B). Impact of MTSEA-The pattern of reactivity of cysteine residues engineered into TM 8 to NEM suggests the presence of an α-helical stripe in contact with an aqueous access pathway. However, in this scenario, one would also expect reactivity of cysteine residues engineered at positions 402 and/or 403. The reactivity of G403C could not be tested because the mutant is devoid of transport activity (Fig. 2). E402C, which has transport activity similar to that of the C74A/C399A control (Fig. 2), was not inhibited by NEM (Fig. 3), but the activity of this mutant could be inhibited by 0.75 mm MTSEA (Fig. 7A). This was not the case for mutants with cysteine residues introduced at surrounding TM 8 positions (Fig. 7A). No significant inhibition by the same concentration of MTSEA was observed with E402A (Fig. 4), suggesting that the inhibition of E402C was due to the modification of the cysteine residue introduced at this position and not to a secondary effect caused by the mutation of the glutamate residue to a small neutral residue. Remarkably, the activity of T406C, although sensitive to NEM (Fig. 3), was not inhibited by MTSEA (Fig. 7A). Preincubation of T406C with MTSEA first followed by a second preincubation with NEM did not result in protection against inhibition by the latter (data not shown). This indicates that the lack of inhibition of transport of T406C by MTSEA is due to the inability of this reagent to modify the cysteine introduced at position 406. When this protocol was applied to cells expressing C74A/C399A, no inhibition of transport was observed, but when the first preincubation was with NEM and the second was with MTSEA, an inhibition of 50% or more was observed (data not shown). Therefore, we could not address the question whether the lack of inhibition of the activity of E402C by NEM was due to the inability of this sulfhydryl reagent to modify the introduced cysteine or that modification in fact took place yet was without functional consequences. MTSEA had only a minor effect on transport activity of a cluster of cysteine mutants from the extracellular half of TM 8; none of the mutants F386C, S387C, M388C, and L389C was inhibited by more than 20% (Fig. 7B). The degree of inhibition of E402C by MTSEA was dependent on the composition of the external medium (Fig. 8A) and was reminiscent of the characteristics of the inhibition of Cys-399 and T406C by NEM (Fig. 5, A and B). The non-transportable substrate analogue SKF-89976A also protected against the inhibition of E402C by MTSEA (p < 0.001) (Fig. 8A), and the same was true for SKF-100330A (data not shown). The protection of E402C by SKF-89976A was dependent on the simultaneous presence of sodium and chloride in the preincubation medium (Fig. 8A). The removal of sodium, but not that of chloride, resulted in an increased inhibition of the activity of E402C by MTSEA (p < 0.001) (Fig. 8A). As with Cys-399 (Fig. 5A), GABA caused a small but significant potentiation of the inhibition by MTSEA (p < 0.01) (Fig. 8A), and this effect was only observed in the presence of both sodium and chloride (data not shown). In contrast to E402C, the slight sensitivity of S387C to MTSEA (p < 0.01) was not significantly influenced by the composition of the preincubation medium (Fig. 8B), and the same was true for NEM. In none of the mutants F386C, M388C, and L389C was a measurable inhibition by either MTSEA or NEM observed under any of the preincubation conditions described here (data not shown). The results described in this study show that four cysteine residues introduced in positions 399, 402, 406, and 410, located on the intracellular half of TM8, react with membrane-permeant sulfhydryl reagents (Figs. 3 and 7A). This inhibition is apparently due to conformational restrictions, imposed by adding bulk and charge to the introduced cysteine residues. The sulfhydryl reagents employed here react with the thiolate anion, and therefore, their reactivity appears to reflect accessibility of the engineered cysteine residues from the aqueous medium. The reactivity of every third or fourth residue is consistent with the periodicity of an α-helix and suggests that only positions located on one face of the α-helix are accessible to the aqueous medium. This result is in harmony with information from the LeuT structure, where the secondary structure of all 12 TMs is α-helical (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). The reactivity of T406C with NEM (Fig. 3) but not with MTSEA (Fig. 7A) indicates that the accessibility at this position is also governed by geometric constraints, and the same may be true for position 402 (Figs. 3 and 7A). In accordance to our earlier observations (15Zhou Y. Zomot E. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22092-22099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the cysteine mutants at positions 395 and 396, located one more turn of the α-helix in the extracellular direction, were devoid of [3H]GABA transport (Fig. 2), prohibiting the determination of the accessibility of sulfhydryl reagents to these positions. In LeuT, the positions corresponding to 395 and 396 of GAT-1 directly ligand Na2, one of the cotransported sodium ions (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Indeed, in GAT-1 these two residues also appear to fulfill the same role (15Zhou Y. Zomot E. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22092-22099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and in contrast to Na1, this site behaves as a low affinity sodium binding site where lithium can replace sodium (15Zhou Y. Zomot E. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22092-22099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, our cysteine-scanning study indicates that the intracellular half of TM8 lines an aqueous accessibility pathway within the transporter, which leads from the cytoplasm to the binding pocket. Such a pathway is not seen in the LeuT structure, but this structure reflects an outward facing conformation of the transporter with the external gate closed (12Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). However, in accordance to the alternating access mechanism of transport proposed over 40 years ago (11Jardetzky O. Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), such a pathway should exist. Indeed, the non-transportable analogue SKF-89976A, expected to lock the transporter in an outward facing conformation, protects against the sulfhydryl modification (Figs. 5, A and B, and 8A), except for D410C (Fig. 5C). Position 410 is located at the extreme cytoplasmic end of TM 8 and is apparently exposed to the cytoplasm in all of the conformations, which GAT-1 assumes during transport. In contrast to the effect of non-transportable analogues, GABA itself causes a mild potentiation of the inhibition of transport by the sulfhydryl reagents when the cysteine residues are (re)introduced at positions 399 (Fig. 5A) and 402 (Fig. 8A). Opposite effects on sulfhydryl reactivity by substrates and substrate analogues have been observed previously in other NSS transporters. When the cysteine residues were located in the proposed extracellular access pathway, reactivity was faster in the presence of a non-transportable substrate analogue and slower in the presence of a transportable substrate in the norepinephrine transporter NET (30Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Conversely, several residues in the intracellular part of TM 5 of SERT reacted faster in the presence of substrate and slower in the presence of a non-transportable analogue and were proposed to line the intracellular pathway leading to the binding pocket (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In GAT-1, GABA reduced the reactivity of cysteines located in the extracellular access pathway (25Rosenberg A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14376-14383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, in several cases, the non-transportable analogue SKF100330A did not potentiate but protected (31Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), presumably by a physical blockade of the sulfhydryl reagent by the bulky blocker. Altogether, the present work and the previous studies suggest a concerted conformational change involving opposite accessibility changes in external and internal pathways. Our results are in excellent agreement with a very recently published study on the serotonin transporter SERT (32Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10338-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). GAT-1 residues Cys-399, Glu-402, Thr-406, and Asp-410 correspond to Ala-441, Glu-444, Thr-448, and Asp-452 of SERT. Cysteine residues introduced at these positions of SERT reacted fastest with sulfhydryl reagents in membrane preparations (32Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10338-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), where both cytoplasmic and extracellular faces are accessible to ligands and MTS reagents (16Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36213-36220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Moreover, this accessibility in SERT was also increased/decreased under conditions favoring the inward/outward facing conformation of the transporter, respectively (32Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10338-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The excellent agreement with our study, where transport in intact cells was used, demonstrates that although a fraction of the applied sulfhydryl reagents may be destroyed by the internal reducing milieu of the cells, sufficient amounts are capable of reacting with the cysteine residues introduced at the cytoplasmic side of the transporter. With two mutants, L392C and F398C, treatment with NEM led to stimulation rather than inhibition of activity (Fig. 3). It should be noted that in both these cases, the introduction of a cysteine led to a marked loss in activity (Fig. 2). This suggests that the adducts of the cysteine residues formed upon reaction with NEM are more conducive to executing the conformational changes required for transport than the free cysteines at these positions. The reactivity at both positions was not conformationally sensitive (Fig. 6), presumably because they are so close to the binding pocket that they are accessible from both sides of the membrane. The cysteine residues introduced at positions 399 and 402 are less accessible in the presence of sodium than in its absence (Figs. 5A and 8A). It is likely that in the absence of sodium, the transporters are predominantly inward facing and that binding of sodium to the few outward facing transporters results in a shift in the equilibrium between the two conformations so as to cause a modest increase in the proportion of outward facing transporters. Indeed, the reactivity in the absence of sodium is similar to that in the presence of sodium and GABA (Figs. 5A and 8A), a condition expected to increase the proportion of inward facing transporters. The relatively limited protection by sodium could be due to an incomplete binding to all transporters at physiological concentrations because of a relatively low apparent affinity of GAT-1 for this cation (6Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 9Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is also possible that the conformation of the transporter in the presence of sodium is distinct from that of the outward and inward facing forms. In this conformation, where the sodium could be in an occluded state (4Kanner B.I. Zomot E. Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 1654-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), positions 399 and 402 could become somewhat accessible from the intracellular side. In such a conformation, the more intracellular position 406 could become even more exposed, and this could explain the more pronounced protection against sulfhydryl modification by SKF-89976A of T406C as well as the lack of the potentiation by GABA (Fig. 5B). The easiest way to explain the observations that the protection by sodium is dependent on the simultaneous presence of chloride (Figs. 5A and 8A) is the well known fact that chloride causes an increase of the apparent affinity of GAT-1 for sodium (6Mager S. Naeve J. Quick M. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 177-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 9Mager S. Kleinberger-Doron N. Keshet G.I. Davidson N. Kanner B.I. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5405-5414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except for T406C (Fig. 5B), the protective effect of the non-transportable analogue SKF-89976A is not only dependent on sodium but also on chloride (Figs. 5A and 8A). Apparently, sodium and chloride are required together for the binding of the blocker. It is possible that the apparent affinity of T406C for sodium is actually higher than in Cys-399 and E402C so that the blocker can bind already to some extent to T406C, even in the absence of chloride (Fig. 5B). Moreover, a small protective effect in the absence of chloride would be easier to detect with T406C, where the protection by the non-transportable substrate analogue is more pronounced than with Cys-399 and E402C (Figs. 5, A and B, and 8A). The transition between the outward and inward facing forms of the NSS transporters was very recently proposed by Forrest et al. (32Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10338-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) to be due to a rocking motion of a bundle consisting of TMs 1, 2, 6, and 7 of the substrate-bound form of the transporter. This model of alternating access correctly predicted that the intracellular part of TM8 participated in the intracellular access pathway (32Forrest L.R. Zhang Y.W. Jacobs M.T. Gesmonde J. Xie L. Honig B.H. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 10338-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Independent support for this role of TM8 comes from a structural study of a transporter from a different family, which nevertheless has the same fold as the NSS family (13Faham S. Watanabe A. Besserer G.M. Cascio D. Specht A. Hirayama B.A. Wright E.M. Abramson J. Science. 2008; 321: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). A different scenario leading to the substrate-induced conformational transition between outward and inward facing forms, namely the movement of TMs 3 and 8, has very recently been proposed by a different group (14Weyand S. Shimamura T. Yajima S. Suzuki S. Mirza O. Krusong K. Carpenter E.P. Rutherford N.G. Hadden J.M. O’Reilly J. Ma P. Saidijam M. Patching S.G. Hope R.J. Norbertczak H.T. Roach P.C. Iwata S. Henderson P.J. Cameron A.D. Science. 2008; 322: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Whatever type of movement triggers this transition, the conformationally sensitive accessibility of engineered cysteine residues reported in this study indicates that in GAT-1, TM 8 also lines an aqueous access pathway from the cytoplasm to the binding pocket when the transporter becomes inward facing. Besides their importance in identification of the access pathways, accessibility studies of the type used here may also be used to experimentally probe novel transport mechanisms (33Shi L. Quick M. Zhao Y. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).

Our results from interspecies heterokaryon assays suggest that heterodimerization with NC2α masks the NES in NC2β, which prevents nuclear export of the NC2 complex. A mutation in either one of the two cNLSs decreases the extent of importin α/β-mediated nuclear import of the NC2 complex. In addition, the NC2 complex can enter the nucleus via a second pathway, facilitated by importin 13.

In this study, we have analyzed whether human NC2 subunits contain localization signals that permit individual crossing of the nuclear membrane or whether nuclear import of NC2α and NC2β depends on heterodimerization. During interphase the exclusive site of nucleocytoplasmic exchange is the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (22Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Although small molecules can traverse the NPC via diffusion the passage of molecules larger than 40 kDa is restricted by the permeability barrier of the NPC (23Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Recent work by Frey and Görlich (24Frey S. Richter R.P. Gorlich D. Science. 2006; 314: 815-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 25Frey S. Gorlich D. Cell. 2007; 130: 512-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) provides evidence that the permeability barrier of the NPC consists of a hydrophobic meshwork with hydrogel-like properties. The passage of this physical barrier requires soluble nuclear transport receptors (also referred to as karyopherins) that recognize intrinsic signal elements displayed on transport cargoes (26Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Import signals named nuclear localization signals (NLSs) can be categorized in classical (cNLS) and non-classical (ncNLS) types. Non-classical NLSs are directly recognized by import receptors, whereas the binding of cNLSs requires an additional importin α adapter protein (27Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The most abundant nuclear export signals (NESs) are leucine-rich and interact with the export receptor chromosome region maintenance 1 (Crm1), also known as exportin 1 (28Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 29Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). A steep RanGTP gradient across the nuclear membrane controls the binding and release of transport cargoes (30Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the NC2 subunits are imported into the nucleus as a preassembled complex. Nuclear accumulation of the NC2 complex occurs via two alternative pathways, facilitated by the importin α/β heterodimer and importin 13. The cNLSs present in each subunit have a cumulative effect on the nuclear targeting efficiency of the NC2 complex. In addition to its cNLS the NC2β subunit exhibits also a leucine-rich NES, which is masked upon heterodimerization with NC2α. Cell Culture-NIH-3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cells obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ number ACC59) and HeLa P4 cells (31Charneau P. Mirambeau G.

The bacterial expression constructs were cloned as follows: the coding regions of human NC2α and NC2β as SpeI/HindIII fragments into the respective sites of pET-41a(+) (Novagen); the coding regions of human NC2α and NC2β as NcoI/HindIII fragments into the respective sites of pETM-30 (EMBL, Heidelberg); the coding regions of human NC2α and NC2β as NdeI/BamHI fragments together with six histidine residues as NcoI/NdeI fragments into the NcoI/BamHI sites of pET-11d (Novagen); and the coding region of murine Ubc9 as an EcoRI/XhoI fragment into the respective sites of pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare). The eukaryotic expression constructs were cloned as follows: the coding regions or gene fragments of human NC2α and NC2β as SalI/BamHI fragments into the respective sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and pPW1 (modified pEGFP-C1 in which EGFP was replaced by RFP using the restriction sites NheI/BglII); the coding regions of human NC2α and NC2β as BglII/PstI fragments into the respective sites of pEGFP-EGFP-N1 (modified pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) in which a second EGFP was inserted C-terminal of the MCS as SalI/BamHI fragment); the coding regions of human NC2α and NC2β as BglII/SalI fragments from the pEGFP-EGFP-N1 expression constructs into the BglII/SalI sites of pmRFP-N1 (modified pEGFP-N1 in which EGFP was replaced by mono-RFP using restriction sites AgeI/NotI); the gene fragments of NC2α (1–10 amino acids) and NC2β (97–106 amino acids) as SalI/BamHI fragments into the respective sites of pEGFP-EGFP-GST-C1 (modified pEGFP-C1 in which GST was inserted N-terminal of the MCS as the BglII/XhoI fragment and in which a second EGFP was inserted at the N terminus as NheI fragment); the coding region and gene fragments of human importin 13 as EcoRI/XhoI fragments were inserted into the respective sites of pCS2flag (modified pCS2plus (32Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 33Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) in which a FLAG tag was inserted N-terminal of the MCS as a NcoI/EcoRI fragment); the coding regions of human importin β, Xenopus importin 7, and murine importin 9 as NruI fragments were inserted into the StuI sites of pCS2flag; and the coding region of human importin 5 as the StuI/XhoI fragment was inserted into the respective sites of pCS2flag. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Andreas Nolte, Abteilung Entwicklungsbiochemie, Universität Göttingen, Germany). Site-directed Mutagenesis-Nucleotide exchanges in RFP-NC2α-(K4A) and RFP-NC2α-(K5A) were inserted using sense amplification primers: 5′-TGCAGTCGACATGCCCTCCGCAAAGAAAAAGTACAATGCC-3′ for K4A, 5′-TGCAGTCGACATGCCCTCCAAGGCAAAAAAGTACAATGCC-3′ for K5A. To generate EGFP-NC2β-(K100A), EGFP-NC2β-(R101A), EGFP-NC2β-(L78A/F80A), NC2β-(L78A/F80A)-RFP, and GST-NC2β-(L78A/F80A) site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit protocol (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-TGTAAAACAGTAGCATTAGCAAGAAGAAAGGCCAGTTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGAACTGGCCTTTCTTCTTGCTAATGCTACTGTTTTACA-3′ (antisense) for K100A, 5′-AAAACAGTAGCATTAAAAGCAAGAAAGGCCAGTTCTCGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGAGAACTGGCCTTTCTTGCTTTTAATGCTACTGTTTT-3′ (antisense) for R101A, and 5′-GTCATACAAGCACTAGAAAGTGCTGGAGCAGGCTCTTACATCAGTGAAGTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TACTTCACTGATGTAAGAGCCTGCTCCAGCACTTTCTAGTGCTTGTATGAC-3′ (antisense) for L78A/F80A. Transfection Experiments-Transfection into HeLa P4 cells was performed with the Effectene™ Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were fixed 24 h after transfection with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and either analyzed directly by fluorescence microscopy or subjected to indirect immunostaining first. For that purpose, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and an anti-FLAG polyclonal (rabbit) antibody (Sigma) and anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibody or anti-rabbit Alexa 555 antibody (Molecular Probes) used to detect FLAG-importin 13. After washing, cells were stained with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) and mounted in Histogel (Linaris Histogel). Heterokaryon Assays-Interspecies heterokaryons of human HeLa P4 cells and mouse NIH-3T3 cells were formed as described previously (34Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa P4 cells were transiently (co-)transfected with plasmid DNA encoding either fluorescently labeled NC2α and NC2β or GFP-QKI-5. Thirty hours post-transfection, non-transfected mouse NIH-3T3 cells were co-plated with the HeLa P4 cells and co-cultured for 18 h. The co-culture was then incubated for 2 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml cycloheximide and another 30 min in 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. The co-cultured cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fused with Sigma HybriMax® warmed to 23 °C for 2 min. Fused cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C in medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for an additional 6 h. The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and counterstained with Hoechst 33258 to distinguish between human and mouse cell nuclei. In Vitro Transcription and Translation-Transcription and translation of human importin 13 fragments (see also Fig. 6A) were performed from the corresponding SP6 promoter constructs (pCS2flag) in vitro. Using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions the proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 2 h in a 12.5-μl volume and the samples were then directly used for GST pulldown assays. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification-Epitope-tagged NC2 complexes were generated as follows: NC2α and NC2β were co-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The cultures were grown at 37 °C to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. After shifting the temperature to 25 °C bacterial protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and the cultures were grown for 4 h. The collected bacteria were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), lysed by sonication, and the recombinant NC2 complexes were purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by either gel filtration on Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) or a second purification step on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The following proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as indicated and subsequently purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B or nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer’s instructions: His6-GST-NC2α, His6-GST-NC2β, and His6-GST-NC2β-(L78A/F80A) at 25 °C for 4 h with 0.2 mm isopropylβ-d-thiogalactopyranoside; and GST-UBC9 at 30 °C for 3 h with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The following transport receptors were expressed in E. coli JM109 or TG1 as described in the literature indicated and were purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen): Xenopus importin α1 (35Gorlich D.

Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). GST Pulldown Assays-GST fusion proteins (or complexes containing GST fusions) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B were used as affinity matrix for binding experiments. Appropriate amounts of affinity matrix were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with bacterial lysates containing expressed import receptors in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The binding experiments were performed in the absence or presence of 2 μm RanQ69L(GTP). After washing three times with ice-cold buffer B, the affinity matrix was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and the matrix-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. For binding to importin 13 fragments, purified GST-NC2α/His6-NC2β and GST-UBC9 were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B that had been preincubated with 10% bovine serum albumin in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The resulting affinity matrix was washed and incubated with 5 μl of the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate containing in vitro transcribed and translated 35S-labeled importin 13 fragments in 300 μl of buffer C supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin. After 3 h at 4 °C, the matrix was washed three times with buffer C, boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and matrix-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging (Amersham Biosciences). For interaction studies with exportin 1, purified His6-GST-NC2β (0.4 μm), His6-GST-NC2β-(L78A/F80A) (0.4 μm), and epitope-tagged NC2 complexes (supplemental Fig. S3) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with purified recombinant exportin 1 (0.2 μm) in buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 2% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Binding of exportin 1 was performed in the absence or presence of 2 μm RanQ69L(GTP). Subsequent binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (20 μl of matrix) was carried out at 4 °C for 12 h. After washing three times with ice-cold buffer D, the matrix was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and matrix-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Both NC2 Subunits Exhibit a Monopartite cNLS-Classical NLSs are characterized as short stretches enriched in basic amino acids (43Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Based on the consensus motifs for cNLSs (44Conti E. Kuriyan J. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (253) Google Scholar) each NC2 subunit contains one putative monopartite cNLS. This type of signal follows the four-residue consensus K-(K/R)-X-(K/R) (45Chelsky D. Ralph R. Jonak G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) with additional sequence requirements up- and downstream (46Conti E. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2002; 35: 93-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The predicted basic stretch in NC2α (4KKKK7) is located in the unstructured N-terminal region, whereas the relevant sequence in NC2β (100KRRK103) is found in the predicted random coiled C-terminal half of the fourth α helix (5Kamada K. Shu F. Chen H. Malik S. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Meisterernst M. Burley S.K. Cell. 2001; 106: 71-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To functionally characterize the putative signals we first compared the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutated NC2 subunits heterologously expressed in HeLa P4 cells (Fig. 1). To visualize the subcellular distribution, both NC2 subunits were fused to green (EGFP) and red (RFP) fluorescent proteins. Surprisingly, the subcellular distribution of the NC2 subunits showed a strong dependence on the position of the fluorescent fusion protein. Tandem EGFP or RFP fused to the C terminus caused a dominant cytoplasmic distribution of the individual NC2 subunits (supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast, fusion of EGFP or RFP to the N terminus caused a nuclear localization pattern of NC2α and a rather homogeneous distribution of NC2β (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1B). Because the subcellular distribution of N-terminal fusion proteins was similar to the localization of endogenous NC2 subunits (data not shown) they were used for further analysis. We observed that wild-type RFP-NC2α no longer accumulated in the nucleus when either lysine residue 4 (K4A) or lysine residue 5 (K5A) was mutated (Fig. 1A). Similar results were found for NC2β, the homogeneous distribution of wild-type EGFP-NC2β was blocked when either lysine residue 100 (K100A) or arginine residue 101 (R101A) of the putative cNLS was substituted for alanine (Fig. 1B). Because the absence of neither critical lysine residues at the second position nor basic amino acid residues at the third position of the four-residue consensus sequence were tolerated, both sequences appeared to represent cNLSs. To analyze whether the predicted sequences are sufficient to mediate nuclear transport of a reporter protein, amino acids 1–10 of NC2α (1MPSKKKKYNA10) and 97–106 of NC2β (97VALKRRKASS106) containing the putative cNLSs (underlined) were fused to EGFP-EGFP-GST (EEG). EEG alone resides exclusively in the cytoplasm when expressed in mammalian cells, because it is too large to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion and does not contain a NLS (Fig. 1C). Fusion of amino acids 1–10 of NC2α or amino acids 97–106 of NC2β to EEG led to efficient nuclear import of the resulting proteins (Fig. 1C). To identify nuclear transport receptors that interact with the individual NC2 subunits, in vitro binding studies were performed. GST-tagged NC2α and NC2β were expressed in E. coli and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. The immobilized fusion proteins were incubated with the importin α/β heterodimer, importin β, transportin 1, importin 5, importin 7, and importin 13, all from bacterial lysates (Fig. 1D). After washing, the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. The importin α/β heterodimer was bound to both NC2 subunits. In the nucleus direct binding of RanGTP to β-family import receptors disintegrates the receptor-substrate interaction. The binding of importin α/β to the NC2 subunits was abolished in the presence of RanGTP, demonstrating its specificity (Fig. 1D). Additionally, weak binding of transportin 1 was observed. However, this interaction was not RanGTP-dependent (data not shown). None of the other import receptors, including importin β alone, bound significantly to the individual NC2 subunits. Together, these results demonstrate that each subunit exhibits a monopartite cNLS, 4KKKK7 in NC2α and 100KRRK103 in NC2β, which are necessary and sufficient for nuclear uptake of the respective NC2 subunit. NC2β Contains Also a Leptomycin B-sensitive NES That Is Recognized by Exportin 1-Next we examined whether the NC2 subunits exhibit NESs in addition to the characterized cNLSs. The first hint toward the existence of an NES was provided by the subcellular localization of N-terminal-tagged NC2β. Despite the presence of a cNLS, wild-type EGFP-NC2β showed a homogeneous localization in transfected cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the first 110 amino acids of NC2β fused to EGFP (EGFP-NC2β-(1–110)) distributed homogeneously in transfected cells similar to the pattern of wild-type NC2β. In contrast, the first 100 amino acids of NC2β fused to EGFP (EGFP-NC2β-(1–100)) showed a cytoplasmic localization at steady state. This loss of nuclear uptake can be explained by the missing cNLS (100KRRK103) of NC2β. This fusion protein, however, is not homogeneously distributed like EGFP alone but strictly cytoplasmically, which can only be explained by the presence of an NES within the first 100 amino acids of NC2β. The most abundant and also the best-characterized NESs are leucine-rich (enriched in hydrophobic amino acids) and interact with the export receptor Crm 1/exportin 1 (28Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 29Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the cytoplasmic localization of fluorescently labeled NC2β was lost on the application of leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of exportin 1 (28Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). We observed that wild-type EGFP-NC2β and NC2β-RFP largely accumulated in the nucleus on LMB treatment for 2 h (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast to NC2β, the strong cytoplasmic distribution of C-terminal-labeled NC2α was not affected by LMB treatment (data not shown) and N-terminal-labeled NC2α showed a largely nuclear localization in transfected HeLa P4 cells (see Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1B). Hence, these results do not provide evidence for the existence of an NES in NC2α. As LMB impairs various cellular pathways the effects of LMB were additionally verified. The sequence analysis of the first 100 amino acids of NC2β revealed one sequence element (71VIQALESLGF80) that fulfills the loosely defined consensus motif for leucine-rich NES: ΦX2–3ΦX2–3ΦXΦ (Φ= Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, Met) (47Bogerd H.P.

https://openalex.org/W2147095766,"The actin cytoskeleton has an important role in the organization and function of the immune synapse during antigen recognition. Dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in response to T cell receptor (TCR) triggering requires the coordinated activation of Rho family GTPases that cycle between active and inactive conformations. This is controlled by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP), which regulate inactivation of Rho GTPases, and guanine exchange factors, which mediate their activation. Whereas much attention has centered on guanine exchange factors for Rho GTPases in T cell activation, the identity and functional roles of the GAP in this process are largely unknown. We previously reported beta2-chimaerin as a diacylglycerol-regulated Rac-GAP that is expressed in T cells. We now demonstrate Lck-dependent phosphorylation of beta2-chimaerin in response to TCR triggering. We identify Tyr-153 as the Lck-dependent phosphorylation residue and show that its phosphorylation negatively regulates membrane stabilization of beta2-chimaerin, decreasing its GAP activity to Rac. This study establishes the existence of TCR-dependent regulation of beta2-chimaerin and identifies a novel mechanism for its inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1978343143,"SEL1L-A, a transmembrane glycoprotein residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is a component of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Alternative splicing generates two smaller SEL1L isoforms, -B and -C, that lack the SEL1L-A membrane-spanning region but retain some sel-1-like repeats, known to be involved in multi-protein interactions and signal transduction. In this study the functional characteristics of SEL1L-B and -C were investigated in human cell models. We show that these two isoforms are induced upon ER stress and activation of the unfolded protein response, together with SEL1L-A. Using transient transfection experiments (based on wild-type and mutant SEL1L constructs) combined with several biochemical tests we show that SEL1L-B and, more prominently, SEL1L-C are secreted glycoproteins. Although SEL1L-C is in monomeric form, SEL1L-B is engaged in intramolecular/intermolecular disulfide bonds. Both isoforms localize in secretory and degradative cellular compartments and in areas of cell-cell contact. However, whereas SEL1L-B is mainly associated with membranes, SEL1L-C shows the typical intralumenal localization of soluble proteins and is present in intercellular spaces. Furthermore, because of its peroxisomal domain, SEL1L-C localizes to peroxisomes. Both SEL1L-B and -C are involved in sorting and exporting unassembled Ig-mu(s) but do not affect two other ERAD substrates, the null Hong Kong variant of alpha(1)-antitrypsin, and mutant alpha(1)-AT Z. Overall these findings suggest that SEL1L-B and -C participate to novel molecular pathways that, in parallel with ERAD, contribute to the disposure of misfolded/unfolded or orphan proteins through degradation or secretion."

In a recent issue of Chemistry & Biology, Bone et al., 2009Bone H.K. Damiano T. Bartlett S. Perry A. Letchford J. Sanchez Ripoli Y. Nelson A.S. Welham M.J. Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 15-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar employed a chemical biology approach to probe the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), a key regulator of pluripotentiality, providing new insights and tools for modulating this process. The multifunctional serine-threonine kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), has recently been identified as a critical modulator of embryonic stem cell (ESC) properties, largely based on experiments using selective GSK-3 inhibitors. Due to the use of various cell lines (from mouse and human), inconsistency in cell culture conditions, and experimental assays, as well as different small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3, the precise role that GSK-3 plays in ESCs has been somewhat ambiguous. Bone et al. used a macrocyclic bisindolylmaleimide compound 1i, previously identified as a selective small-molecule ATP-competitive inhibitor of GSK-3, and contrasted its effects with two structurally distinct GSK-3 inhibitors that have previously been reported: 6-bromoindirubin-3-oxime (BIO) and TWS119. BIO was initially demonstrated to be capable of maintaining the pluripotency of both mouse and human ESCs through a mechanism dependent upon activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Sato et al., 2004Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was reported that sustained GSK-3 inhibition or canonical Wnt activation in both mouse and human ESCs promotes their differentiation into multipotent mesendodermal progenitors or their differentiated progeny (Bakre et al., 2007Bakre M.M. Hoi A. Mong J.C. Koh Y.Y. Wong K.Y. Stanton L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31703-31712Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Dravid et al., 2005Dravid G. Ye Z. Hammond H. Chen G. Pyle A. Donovan P. Yu X. Cheng L. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 1489-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). While most studies with GSK-3 inhibitors and ESCs support a role for GSK-3 in the maintenance of undifferentiated pluripotent cells, the GSK-3 inhibitor TWS119 was reported to induce neuronal differentiation of ESCs (Ding et al., 2003Ding S. Wu T.Y. Brinker A. Peters E.C. Hur W. Gray N.S. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 7632-7637Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The standard method used to propagate mouse ESCs (mESCs) is in rich medium, containing high levels of fetal bovine serum, supplemented with the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), although serum-free medium containing only LIF and bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) is sufficient to maintain these cells in a self-renewing, undifferentiated state. The proposed mode of action of these extrinsic factors is that LIF activation of Stat3 enhances ESC self-renewal, while BMP4, acting through Smad-mediated induction of inhibitor of differentiation (Id) proteins, blocks neuronal differentiation and supports self-renewal (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). In vitro GSK-3 activity assays indicated that 1i inhibits GSK-3 present in mESC lysates with an IC50 of 250 nM, some 5-fold higher than that obtained with BIO. Bone et al., 2009Bone H.K. Damiano T. Bartlett S. Perry A. Letchford J. Sanchez Ripoli Y. Nelson A.S. Welham M.J. Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 15-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar then sought to determine if 1i was capable of enhancing the propagation of undifferentiated mESCs as previously reported for BIO. Undifferentiated ESCs express high levels of alkaline phosphatase (AP), which is easily detected through histochemical staining for enzymatic activity. The authors used AP staining as a surrogate marker for undifferentiated mESC colonies in a clonal assay in which limiting dilutions of ESCs were plated out in serum and LIF for 5 days. Colonies present after this 5 day period were scored based on their AP levels. The inhibitors TWS119 (2 μM), BIO (0.5 μM), or 1i (5 μM) each elevated the number of undifferentiated ESC clones scored in this manner and, thus, were interpreted to enhance ESC self-renewal. One of the best-characterized GSK-3 substrates is the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin, a mediator of canonical Wnt signaling. GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin promotes its proteasomal degradation; inhibition of GSK-3 therefore results in β-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus where it activates T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF)-mediated transcription of target genes. To assess the relative extent of GSK-3 inhibition obtained by 1i, BIO, or TWS119 in mESCs, Bone et al., monitored the stabilization of β-catenin and the subsequent activation of the β-catenin/TCF reporter constructs as indicators of GSK-3 inhibition in intact cells. The minimal concentrations of BIO and 1i that resulted in detectable β-catenin dephosphorylation on GSK-3 target residues after a 30 min incubation also enhanced TCF-reporter activity to a similar extent and correlated with the concentrations of each inhibitor that enhanced maintenance of AP-positive mESC colonies. In contrast, the inhibitor TWS119, increased the number of AP-positive mESC colonies scored at 5 days at 2 μM, yet only modestly elevated TCF-reporter activity at this dose, suggesting that it might have other targets in mESCs that may be responsible for its distinct effects, such as neuronal differentiation. Bone et al. went on to synthesize 48 derivatives of 1i with the goal of enhancing the potency of the lead compound. The new compounds were screened based on the clonal mESC self-renewal assay described above, and 12 were found to enhance maintenance of undifferentiated mESC with potency equal to or better than 1i. A more detailed characterization of the twelve most effective compounds revealed a direct correlation between a compound's potency for GSK-3 inhibition and ability to enhance the retention of undifferentiated mESC colonies. The three most potent derivatives (1l, 1m, and 1o) were approximately 10× more potent than the lead compound, 1i. The extent to which GSK-3 inhibitors 1i, 1l, 1m, 1o, BIO, and TWS119 exerted off-target effects on three pathways regulating mESC self-renewal—the Stat3, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK—pathways, was tested. While 1i, 1l, 1m, and 1o had no apparent affect on these signaling pathways, both BIO and TWS119 caused significant suppression of Erk1/2 signaling and Stat3 phosphorylation. All of the GSK-3 inhibitors tested by Bone et al. enhanced maintenance of undifferentiated mESCs only in the presence of LIF and serum. While the Bone et al. analysis strengthens the notion that small molecule inhibitors of GSK-3 potentiate self-renewal of pluripotent mESCs, the mechanism through which GSK-3 inhibition imparts this effect is still unclear. That GSK-3 inhibition in and of itself enhances self-renewal of mESCS is not surprising given that GSK-3 nullizygous ESCs display this phenotype (Doble et al., 2007Doble B.W. Patel S. Wood G.A. Kockeritz L.K. Woodgett J.R. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 957-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Still, the newly synthesized, highly specific, and potent 1i-based GSK-3 inhibitor series should prove very useful for further dissection of GSK-3's role in stem cell biology. GSK-3 has the unique property of regulating multiple signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, Notch, and PI3K pathways (Figure 1), and also directly regulates numerous transcription factors, including c-Myc, which has been directly linked to mESC self-renewal and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation. There is accumulating evidence that the PI3K pathway plays a role in the regulation of pluripotency in mESCs and human ESCs (Welham et al., 2007Welham M.J. Storm M.P. Kingham E. Bone H.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism(s) through which PI3K signaling regulate ESC self-renewal and pluripotency is still unclear, but regulation of Nanog transcript levels plays at least a partial role. GSK-3 has been implicated in the cascade involving PI3K and Nanog, although the relevant, direct GSK-3 substrates remain unknown. Further studies remain to be completed before GSK-3 inhibition-dependent β-catenin stabilization can be excluded from playing a role in ESC self-renewal, especially given recent data suggesting that TCF3 is a component of the core transcription factors regulating ESC pluripotency (Cole et al., 2008Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Newman J.J. Kagey M.H. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Inhibition of GSK-3, combined with inhibition of FGF-mediated MAPK signaling, has been reported to be sufficient for maintenance of mESCs in serum-free culture conditions (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, inhibition of GSK-3 has been proposed to act primarily via promotion of cell viability. The study by Bone et al., in which GSK-3 inhibition retains an effect in the presence of serum and LIF, suggests that GSK-3 inhibition exerts direct effects on ESC self-renewal machinery in addition to any function as a survival factor. The development of defined chemical cocktails that maintain stem cell pluripotency would simplify expansion of ESC and iPSCs by overcoming the current need for animal sera and protein factors. A chemical genetics approach, such as that used by Bone et al., uses the phenotype of a classical genetic modification (e.g., GSK-3 DKO) as the “gold standard” that is to be mimicked through chemical means. This powerful strategy allows for the development of “clean” chemical tools with minimal undesired off-target effects, which will be invaluable for future stem cell applications."

Researchers may use lines derived elsewhere, provided that their derivation met consensus core standards. Some types of derivation raise heightened levels of ethical concern and require greater scrutiny. To maintain public trust, research institutions need to justify why they allow researchers to use lines whose derivation would not have been permitted locally."
https://openalex.org/W2014619825,"Dynamic remodeling of the microtubule cytoskeleton is essential for many cell processes including division, migration and differentiation. Microtubules are dynamic polymers of α/β-tubulin dimers and switch stochastically between phases of growth (polymerization) and shortening (depolymerization). Transitions from growth to shortening are referred to as catastrophes, and transitions from shortening to growth are called rescues. Intracellular microtubule organization is controlled by the activity and distribution of nucleation sites, proteins that directly influence polymerization dynamics, proteins that cut or bundle existing microtubules, and proteins that indirectly stabilize microtubules. In cells, microtubule nucleation is mediated by the multi-subunit γ-Tubulin Ring Complex. Associated proteins such as Cep192 recruit the γ-TuRC to the centrosome or spindle poles. However, regulation of microtubule nucleation is incompletely understood. In differentiated cells, microtubule minus ends are often redistributed away from the centrosome. For example, ninein anchors minus ends to cell-cell junctions in polarized epithelial cells and to desmosomes in differentiated keratinocytes. Several different proteins influence microtubule polymerization dynamics by direct interactions with microtubule plus ends. EB-family proteins directly recognize biochemical or structural differences at the growing microtubule end, influence microtubule polymerization dynamics, and may act as adaptors that mediate the association of other proteins with growing microtubule plus ends. Proteins of the XMAP215 family are thought to enhance the microtubule polymerization rate by processively adding tubulin subunits to the growing end. In contrast, neuronal CRMP-2 enhances microtubule assembly by interacting with free tubulin dimers. Microtubule disassembly is promoted by two different mechanisms. Stathmin is a small protein that binds to tubulin dimers and lowers the pool of free tubulin available for polymerization, thus decreasing microtubule growth rate and increasing catastrophe frequency. In contrast, internal motor domain kinesins directly bind to microtubule ends and utilize ATP hydrolysis to catalytically depolymerize microtubules. Microtubule-severing proteins cut existing microtubules generating new minus and plus ends. The generation of short microtubule fragments by these proteins is important for reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton without complete microtubule disassembly. Because organization and dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton is crucial for many cellular functions, most direct regulators of microtubule nucleation, polymerization and disassembly are involved in multiple cell processes. In addition, the existence of plant-specific families of microtubule regulatory proteins such as SPIRAL emphasizes important differences in microtubule function and organization between plant and animal cells."
