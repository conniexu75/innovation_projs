https://openalex.org/W2807884764,"The diversity of cell types and regulatory states in the brain, and how these change during aging, remains largely unknown. We present a single-cell transcriptome atlas of the entire adult Drosophila melanogaster brain sampled across its lifespan. Cell clustering identified 87 initial cell clusters that are further subclustered and validated by targeted cell-sorting. Our data show high granularity and identify a wide range of cell types. Gene network analyses using SCENIC revealed regulatory heterogeneity linked to energy consumption. During aging, RNA content declines exponentially without affecting neuronal identity in old brains. This single-cell brain atlas covers nearly all cells in the normal brain and provides the tools to study cellular diversity alongside other Drosophila and mammalian single-cell datasets in our unique single-cell analysis platform: SCope (http://scope.aertslab.org). These results, together with SCope, allow comprehensive exploration of all transcriptional states of an entire aging brain."
https://openalex.org/W2807985734,"Nearly all prostate cancer deaths are from metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but there have been few whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies of this disease state. We performed linked-read WGS on 23 mCRPC biopsy specimens and analyzed cell-free DNA sequencing data from 86 patients with mCRPC. In addition to frequent rearrangements affecting known prostate cancer genes, we observed complex rearrangements of the AR locus in most cases. Unexpectedly, these rearrangements include highly recurrent tandem duplications involving an upstream enhancer of AR in 70%-87% of cases compared with <2% of primary prostate cancers. A subset of cases displayed AR or MYC enhancer duplication in the context of a genome-wide tandem duplicator phenotype associated with CDK12 inactivation. Our findings highlight the complex genomic structure of mCRPC, nominate alterations that may inform prostate cancer treatment, and suggest that additional recurrent events in the non-coding mCRPC genome remain to be discovered."
https://openalex.org/W2808687910,"Increased androgen receptor (AR) activity drives therapeutic resistance in advanced prostate cancer. The most common resistance mechanism is amplification of this locus presumably targeting the AR gene. Here, we identify and characterize a somatically acquired AR enhancer located 650 kb centromeric to the AR. Systematic perturbation of this enhancer using genome editing decreased proliferation by suppressing AR levels. Insertion of an additional copy of this region sufficed to increase proliferation under low androgen conditions and to decrease sensitivity to enzalutamide. Epigenetic data generated in localized prostate tumors and benign specimens support the notion that this region is a developmental enhancer. Collectively, these observations underscore the importance of epigenomic profiling in primary specimens and the value of deploying genome editing to functionally characterize noncoding elements. More broadly, this work identifies a therapeutic vulnerability for targeting the AR and emphasizes the importance of regulatory elements as highly recurrent oncogenic drivers."
https://openalex.org/W2808682367,"Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are thought to drive the genesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as relapse following chemotherapy. Because of their unique biology, developing effective methods to eradicate LSCs has been a significant challenge. In the present study, we demonstrate that intrinsic overexpression of the mitochondrial dynamics regulator FIS1 mediates mitophagy activity that is essential for primitive AML cells. Depletion of FIS1 attenuates mitophagy and leads to inactivation of GSK3, myeloid differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and a profound loss of LSC self-renewal potential. Further, we report that the central metabolic stress regulator AMPK is also intrinsically activated in LSC populations and is upstream of FIS1. Inhibition of AMPK signaling recapitulates the biological effect of FIS1 loss. These data suggest a model in which LSCs co-opt AMPK/FIS1-mediated mitophagy as a means to maintain stem cell properties that may be otherwise compromised by the stresses induced by oncogenic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2807798687,"Transcription factors regulate the molecular, morphological, and physiological characteristics of neurons and generate their impressive cell-type diversity. To gain insight into the general principles that govern how transcription factors regulate cell-type diversity, we used large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the extensive cellular diversity in the Drosophila optic lobes. We sequenced 55,000 single cells and assigned them to 52 clusters. We validated and annotated many clusters using RNA sequencing of FACS-sorted single-cell types and cluster-specific genes. To identify transcription factors responsible for inducing specific terminal differentiation features, we generated a “random forest” model, and we showed that the transcription factors Apterous and Traffic-jam are required in many but not all cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons, respectively. In fact, the same terminal characters often can be regulated by different transcription factors in different cell types, arguing for extensive phenotypic convergence. Our data provide a deep understanding of the developmental and functional specification of a complex brain structure."
https://openalex.org/W2808129035,"Oligonucleotides are almost exclusively synthesized using the nucleoside phosphoramidite method, even though it is limited to the direct synthesis of ∼200 mers and produces hazardous waste. Here, we describe an oligonucleotide synthesis strategy that uses the template-independent polymerase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Each TdT molecule is conjugated to a single deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) molecule that it can incorporate into a primer. After incorporation of the tethered dNTP, the 3' end of the primer remains covalently bound to TdT and is inaccessible to other TdT-dNTP molecules. Cleaving the linkage between TdT and the incorporated nucleotide releases the primer and allows subsequent extension. We demonstrate that TdT-dNTP conjugates can quantitatively extend a primer by a single nucleotide in 10-20 s, and that the scheme can be iterated to write a defined sequence. This approach may form the basis of an enzymatic oligonucleotide synthesizer."
https://openalex.org/W2808287878,"Extracellular proTGF-β is covalently linked to ""milieu"" molecules in the matrix or on cell surfaces and is latent until TGF-β is released by integrins. Here, we show that LRRC33 on the surface of microglia functions as a milieu molecule and enables highly localized, integrin-αVβ8-dependent TGF-β activation. Lrrc33-/- mice lack CNS vascular abnormalities associated with deficiency in TGF-β-activating integrins but have microglia with a reactive phenotype and after 2 months develop ascending paraparesis with loss of myelinated axons and death by 5 months. Whole bone marrow transplantation results in selective repopulation of Lrrc33-/- brains with WT microglia and halts disease progression. The phenotypes of WT and Lrrc33-/- microglia in the same brain suggest that there is little spreading of TGF-β activated from one microglial cell to neighboring microglia. Our results suggest that interactions between integrin-bearing cells and cells bearing milieu molecule-associated TGF-β provide localized and selective activation of TGF-β."
https://openalex.org/W2808096245,"Heterogeneity is a hallmark feature of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. Following infection, naive T cells differentiate into various subsets of effector and memory T cells, which help to eliminate pathogens and maintain long-term immunity. The current model suggests there is a single lineage of naive T cells that give rise to different populations of effector and memory T cells depending on the type and amounts of stimulation they encounter during infection. Here, we have discovered that multiple sub-populations of cells exist in the naive CD8+ T cell pool that are distinguished by their developmental origin, unique transcriptional profiles, distinct chromatin landscapes, and different kinetics and phenotypes after microbial challenge. These data demonstrate that the naive CD8+ T cell pool is not as homogeneous as previously thought and offers a new framework for explaining the remarkable heterogeneity in the effector and memory T cell subsets that arise after infection."
https://openalex.org/W2808209916,"Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia and other brain regions. The genetic basis of this disorder remains unknown in a significant portion of familial cases. Here, we reported a recessive causal gene, MYORG, for PFBC. Compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations of MYORG co-segregated completely with PFBC in six families, with logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 4.91 at the zero recombination fraction. In mice, Myorg mRNA was expressed specifically in S100β-positive astrocytes, and knockout of Myorg induced the formation of brain calcification at 9 months of age. Our findings provide strong evidence that loss-of-function mutations of MYORG cause brain calcification in humans and mice."
https://openalex.org/W2807936349,"Zinc (Zn) deficiency is the most consistently discovered nutritional manifestations of fatty liver disease. Although Zn is known to stimulate hepatic lipid oxidation, little is known about its underlying mechanism of action in lipolysis. Given the potential role of lipophagy in lipid metabolism, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that Zn attenuates hepatic lipid accumulation by modulating lipophagy. The present study indicated that Zn is a potent promoter of lipophagy. Zn administration significantly alleviated hepatocellular lipid accumulation and increased the release of free fatty acids in association with enhanced fatty acid oxidation and inhibited lipogenesis, which was accompanied by activation of autophagy. Moreover, Zn reduced lipid accumulation and stimulated lipolysis by autophagy-mediated lipophagy. Zn-induced up-regulation of autophagy and lipid depletion is free Zn2+-dependent in the cytosols. Zn-induced autophagy and lipid turnover involved up-regulation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-β (Ca2+/CaMKKβ)/AMPK pathway. Meanwhile, Zn2+-activated autophagy and lipid depletion were via enhancing metal response element-binding transcription factor (MTF)-1 DNA binding at PPARα promoter region, which in turn induced transcriptional activation of the key genes related to autophagy and lipolysis. Zn activated the pathways of Zn2+/MTF-1/ Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α and Ca2+/CaMKKβ/AMPK, resulting in the up-regulation of lipophagy and accordingly reduced hepatic lipid accumulation. Our study, for the first time, provided innovative evidence of the direct relationship between metal elements (Zn) and lipid metabolism. The present study also indicated the novel mechanism for Zn-induced lipolysis by the activation of Zn2+/MTF-1/PPARα and Ca2+/CaMKKβ/AMPK pathways, which induced the occurrence of lipophagy. These results provide new insight into Zn nutrition and its potential beneficial effects on the prevention of fatty liver disease in vertebrates.-Wei, C.-C., Luo, Z., Hogstrand, C., Xu, Y.-H., Wu, L.-X., Chen, G.-H., Pan, Y.-X., Song, Y.-F. Zinc reduces hepatic lipid deposition and activates lipophagy via Zn2+/MTF-1/PPARα and Ca2+/CaMKKβ/AMPK pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2808318933,"In colorectal cancer patients, a high density of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in tumors is associated with better prognosis. Using a Stat3 loss-of-function approach in two wnt/β-catenin-dependent autochthonous models of sporadic intestinal tumorigenesis, we unravel a complex intracellular process in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) that controls the induction of a CD8+ T cell based adaptive immune response. Elevated mitophagy in IECs causes iron(II)-accumulation in epithelial lysosomes, in turn, triggering lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Subsequent release of proteases into the cytoplasm augments MHC class I presentation and activation of CD8+ T cells via cross-dressing of dendritic cells. Thus, our findings highlight a so-far-unrecognized link between mitochondrial function, lysosomal integrity, and MHC class I presentation in IECs and suggest that therapies triggering mitophagy or inducing LMP in IECs may prove successful in shifting the balance toward anti-tumor immunity in colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2807998183,"Each odorant receptor corresponds to a unique glomerulus in the brain. Projections from different glomeruli then converge in higher brain regions, but we do not understand the logic governing which glomeruli converge and which do not. Here, we use two-photon optogenetics to map glomerular connections onto neurons in the lateral horn, the region of the Drosophila brain that receives the majority of olfactory projections. We identify 39 morphological types of lateral horn neurons (LHNs) and show that different types receive input from different combinations of glomeruli. We find that different LHN types do not have independent inputs; rather, certain combinations of glomeruli converge onto many of the same LHNs and so are over-represented. Notably, many over-represented combinations are composed of glomeruli that prefer chemically dissimilar ligands whose co-occurrence indicates a behaviorally relevant ""odor scene."" The pattern of glomerulus-LHN connections thus represents a prediction of what ligand combinations will be most salient."
https://openalex.org/W2808099452,"Infections by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are difficult to manage owing to broad antibiotic resistance profiles and because of the inability of clinically used β-lactamase inhibitors to counter the activity of metallo-β-lactamases often harbored by these pathogens. Of particular importance is New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM), which requires a di-nuclear zinc ion cluster for catalytic activity. Here, we compare the structures and functions of clinical NDM variants 1-17. The impact of NDM variants on structure is probed by comparing melting temperature and refolding efficiency and also by spectroscopy (UV-visible, 1H NMR, and EPR) of di-cobalt metalloforms. The impact of NDM variants on function is probed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations of various antibiotics, pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetics, inhibitor binding, and zinc dependence of resistance and activity. We observed only minor differences among the fully loaded di-zinc enzymes, but most NDM variants had more distinguishable selective advantages in experiments that mimicked zinc scarcity imposed by typical host defenses. Most NDM variants exhibited improved thermostability (up to ∼10 °C increased Tm ) and improved zinc affinity (up to ∼10-fold decreased Kd, Zn2). We also provide first evidence that some NDM variants have evolved the ability to function as mono-zinc enzymes with high catalytic efficiency (NDM-15, ampicillin: kcat/Km = 5 × 106 m-1 s-1). These findings reveal the molecular mechanisms that NDM variants have evolved to overcome the combined selective pressures of β-lactam antibiotics and zinc deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2768034240,"The attractor neural network scenario is a popular scenario for memory storage in the association cortex, but there is still a large gap between models based on this scenario and experimental data. We study a recurrent network model in which both learning rules and distribution of stored patterns are inferred from distributions of visual responses for novel and familiar images in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Unlike classical attractor neural network models, our model exhibits graded activity in retrieval states, with distributions of firing rates that are close to lognormal. Inferred learning rules are close to maximizing the number of stored patterns within a family of unsupervised Hebbian learning rules, suggesting that learning rules in ITC are optimized to store a large number of attractor states. Finally, we show that there exist two types of retrieval states: one in which firing rates are constant in time and another in which firing rates fluctuate chaotically."
https://openalex.org/W2807786681,"Cytokines are signaling molecules secreted and sensed by immune and other cell types, enabling dynamic intercellular communication. Although a vast amount of data on these interactions exists, this information is not compiled, integrated or easily searchable. Here we report immuneXpresso, a text-mining engine that structures and standardizes knowledge of immune intercellular communication. We applied immuneXpresso to PubMed to identify relationships between 340 cell types and 140 cytokines across thousands of diseases. The method is able to distinguish between incoming and outgoing interactions, and it includes the effect of the interaction and the cellular function involved. These factors are assigned a confidence score and linked to the disease. By leveraging the breadth of this network, we predicted and experimentally verified previously unappreciated cell-cytokine interactions. We also built a global immune-centric view of diseases and used it to predict cytokine-disease associations. This standardized knowledgebase (http://www.immunexpresso.org) opens up new directions for interpretation of immune data and model-driven systems immunology."
https://openalex.org/W2808624959,"The ability to remember and to navigate to safe places is necessary for survival. Place navigation is known to involve medial entorhinal cortex (MEC)-hippocampal connections. However, learning-dependent changes in neuronal activity in the distinct circuits remain unknown. Here, by using optic fiber photometry in freely behaving mice, we discovered the experience-dependent induction of a persistent-task-associated (PTA) activity. This PTA activity critically depends on learned visual cues and builds up selectively in the MEC layer II-dentate gyrus, but not in the MEC layer III-CA1 pathway, and its optogenetic suppression disrupts navigation to the target location. The findings suggest that the visual system, the MEC layer II, and the dentate gyrus are essential hubs of a memory circuit for visually guided navigation."
https://openalex.org/W2808269440,"Feature-based visual short-term memory is known to engage both sensory and association cortices. However, the extent of the participating circuit and the neural mechanisms underlying memory maintenance is still a matter of vigorous debate. To address these questions, we recorded neuronal activity from 42 cortical areas in monkeys performing a feature-based visual short-term memory task and an interleaved fixation task. We find that task-dependent differences in firing rates are widely distributed throughout the cortex, while stimulus-specific changes in firing rates are more restricted and hierarchically organized. We also show that microsaccades during the memory delay encode the stimuli held in memory and that units modulated by microsaccades are more likely to exhibit stimulus specificity, suggesting that eye movements contribute to visual short-term memory processes. These results support a framework in which most cortical areas, within a modality, contribute to mnemonic representations at timescales that increase along the cortical hierarchy."

Animals respond to survival needs flexibly, in part through their brain’s ability to store and use information about past experiences. A key component of such episodic memories is where they occurred. The hippocampus, a mammalian brain structure that is implicated in the formation and storage of episodic memories, is believed to contain such a representation. A set of hippocampal pyramidal neurons—called place cells—collectively encodes the animal’s location in a given environment (Derdikman and Knierim, 2014Derdikman D. Knierim J.J.

As experiences unfold, environments change, and learning proceeds, neurons need to be recruited to or released from the active ensembles for different representations at approximately equal rates. Thus, each neuron should be capable of reversibly and efficiently switching between active and inactive states, as has been observed (e.g., Frank et al., 2004Frank L.M. Stanley G.B. Brown E.N.

Long-term dynamics of CA1 hippocampal place codes.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The output of pyramidal neurons is determined by the properties of the synaptic inputs they receive as well as their excitability. For example, regulation of cellular membrane potential is an efficient and reversible mechanism that may allow spatially tuned neuronal firing to be modulated by context or network-wide adaptive control. Indeed, a recent study (Lee et al., 2012Lee D. Lin B.J. Lee A.K. Hippocampal place fields emerge upon single-cell manipulation of excitability during behavior.Science. 2012; 337: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) demonstrated that changes in membrane potential have striking effects on spatially modulated activity. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording in hippocampal area CA1 of awake, freely moving rats, Lee et al., 2012Lee D. Lin B.J. Lee A.K. Hippocampal place fields emerge upon single-cell manipulation of excitability during behavior.Science. 2012; 337: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar found that a small, constant depolarization of somatic membrane potential (Vm) by just a few millivolts could rapidly and reversibly convert a pyramidal neuron from a silent cell (i.e., without place-related firing) to a place cell; conversely, a small hyperpolarization could convert the neuron function from a place cell to a silent cell. Remarkably, this rapid, Vm-dependent creation or removal of place cell firing was accompanied by a strikingly nonlinear voltage dependence of spatially tuned synaptic responses recorded below the action potential threshold. To determine what kinds of cellular mechanisms support this steep voltage dependence of spatially modulated synaptic responses, we used a pharmacological approach while performing patch-clamp recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons in brain slices (in vitro) and in awake, behaving mice during navigation of virtual environments (in vivo). Our experiments revealed a critical contribution of persistent sodium current, which mediated high-gain, subthreshold synaptic amplification, consequently driving spatially dependent firing in CA1 pyramidal neurons. In addition, motivated by a recent finding that dendritic plateau potentials can induce the formation of new, long-lasting place fields in pyramidal neurons via synaptic plasticity (Bittner et al., 2015Bittner K.C. Grienberger C. Vaidya S.P. Milstein A.D. Macklin J.J. Suh J. Tonegawa S. Magee J.C. Conjunctive input processing drives feature selectivity in hippocampal CA1 neurons.Nat.

Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity underlies CA1 place fields.Science. 2017; 357: 1033-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), we found that dendritic plateau potentials were facilitated by dendritic depolarization. Therefore, we propose that multiple voltage-dependent mechanisms can influence place cell firing: depolarization contributes to the conjunctive responses of hippocampal neurons to inputs carrying information about place and other contextual features, as well as the formation and/or stabilization of these neural representations via synaptic plasticity. To study the cellular mechanisms underlying the steep dependence of synaptic responses on baseline Vm observed in vivo (Lee et al., 2012Lee D. Lin B.J. Lee A.K. Hippocampal place fields emerge upon single-cell manipulation of excitability during behavior.Science. 2012; 337: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we first sought to reproduce this phenomenon in vitro. Somatic whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices, and stimulating electrodes were used to activate synaptic inputs from the entorhinal cortex (EC) onto distal apical tuft dendrites and/or from CA3 onto more proximal dendrites. GABAergic inhibition was blocked to isolate excitatory synaptic responses (unless noted otherwise). We mimicked the property of silent cells observed in vivo (Lee et al., 2012Lee D. Lin B.J. Lee A.K. Hippocampal place fields emerge upon single-cell manipulation of excitability during behavior.Science. 2012; 337: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which had little observable spatially tuned somatic responses, by stimulating synapses in vitro at low intensities to produce small, subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic responses (EPSPs) at or near the resting Vm (average peak response, <2.5 mV for one-pathway stimulation and <5 mV for two-pathway stimulation for all stimulus patterns tested; see below). To examine the voltage dependence of these responses, we applied direct-current (DC) injection via the somatic patch electrode to modulate baseline Vm, again mirroring previous experiments (Lee et al., 2012Lee D. Lin B.J. Lee A.K. Hippocampal place fields emerge upon single-cell manipulation of excitability during behavior.Science. 2012; 337: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this experimental design, we regard activation of EC and/or CA3 inputs as corresponding to transient, spatially modulated synaptic inputs. We view the constant current injection as a counterpart of relatively slow synaptic responses, which might convey contextual information or drive an adaptive control of the network activity level. For low-frequency activation of EC synapses, temporally isolated EPSPs had a shallow voltage dependence (Figure 1A). In contrast, for high-frequency activation of EC synapses, burst EPSPs showed a strikingly steep voltage dependence, with the steepest transition occurring within a narrow range of ∼4 mV, centered around −56 to −57 mV (Figure 1B; for peak amplitude, −56.4 ± 0.8 mV; for integral, −57.0 ± 0.7 mV; n = 6 neurons from 5 rats) and an amplification ratio of 3- to 5-fold (for peak amplitude, 3.06 ± 0.16; for integral, 4.78 ± 0.28; n = 50 neurons from 41 rats). All of these measures were nearly identical to the values reported in vivo (Lee et al., 2012Lee D. Lin B.J. Lee A.K. Hippocampal place fields emerge upon single-cell manipulation of excitability during behavior.Science. 2012; 337: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Notably, even very small temporally summated EPSPs (average peak response <1 mV near the resting Vm) manifested this voltage-dependent amplification (see the example in Figure 1B); however, temporally isolated EPSPs with matched or even larger peak amplitudes did not (compare the examples in Figures 1A and 1B). The voltage-dependent synaptic amplification was robust across cells (50 of 50 neurons tested). Like Lee et al., 2012Lee D. Lin B.J. Lee A.K. Hippocampal place fields emerge upon single-cell manipulation of excitability during behavior.Science. 2012; 337: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, we observed a steep transition of responses at Vm below the threshold for somatic action potential firing. For a given cell, amplified EPSPs at Vm beyond the transition Vm (defined as the baseline Vm for which the difference between all of the responses at more hyperpolarized versus more depolarized Vm was maximized; STAR Methods) were usually large enough to trigger action potentials, as observed in vivo. Importantly, although action potentials are known to activate many different membrane currents (Anwyl, 1999Anwyl R. Metabotropic glutamate receptors: electrophysiological properties and role in plasticity.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1999; 29: 83-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, Bean, 2007Bean B.P.

Moreover, after a spike removal procedure was applied (STAR Methods), the peak depolarization measured always occurred just prior to the initiation of the first action potential. Therefore, voltage-dependent amplification can promote action potential firing but does not require it. To test the robustness of the synaptic amplification in vitro, we assessed the influences of some factors that differ between in vitro and in vivo conditions. First, although synaptic inhibition was blocked in the experiments described so far, we also observed synaptic amplification when GABAergic inhibition was intact (Figure S1A). Second, in exploring animals, CA1 pyramidal neurons receive excitatory inputs from multiple synaptic pathways. We showed that the amplification in vitro was observed when either one or both major excitatory pathways were stimulated (see below). Third, the activity of hippocampal neurons in vivo is modulated by a strong theta rhythm when the animal is exploring an environment. The amplification was the same when synaptic activation was performed using bursts of high-frequency stimulation modulated at a theta frequency (5 Hz; i.e., inter-burst interval of 200 ms; Figure S1B; for both peak amplitude and integral, p > 0.05 by Student’s t test). CA1 pyramidal neurons show prolonged and time-varying activity in vivo when an animal traverses a place field (Harvey et al., 2009Harvey C.D. Collman F. Dombeck D.A. Tank D.W.

Place units in the hippocampus of the freely moving rat.Exp. Neurol. 1976; 51: 78-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), as do upstream neurons that provide the synaptic input they receive (Domnisoru et al., 2013Domnisoru C. Kinkhabwala A.A.

Cellular mechanisms of spatial navigation in the medial entorhinal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To determine whether the synaptic amplification in vitro generalizes to behaviorally relevant timescales and dynamics, we used a stimulus pattern of a longer total duration (1.2 s) and the instantaneous frequency modulated by a slow, symmetric ramp (minimum, ∼3 Hz; maximum, ∼50 Hz). For this ramp-modulated activation of EC synapses, EPSPs also showed a robust, steep voltage dependence (9 of 9 neurons from 9 rats; Figure 1C), which was observed across different combinations of total durations and frequency ranges tested as long as EPSPs exhibited temporal summation (additional parameters tested: 2.2 and 4 s for duration; 12, 20, 100, and 150 Hz for maximum instantaneous frequency; apparent amplification observed at 100 and 150 Hz; data not shown; n = 4 neurons from 4 rats). These experiments demonstrate that the steep dependence of synaptic responses on Vm observed in vivo can be recapitulated using a reduced in vitro system. Even very small synaptic responses (<1 mV measured near the resting Vm) that persisted for behaviorally relevant timescales (seconds) exhibited voltage-dependent amplification with a high gain upon somatic depolarization. The ability to recapture these features in vitro facilitates detailed mechanistic analyses. To determine which kinds of voltage-dependent ion channels underlie the amplification of synaptic responses, we applied various pharmacological agents via the bath. Surprisingly, we found that blocking the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) with 50 μM AP5 (Figure 2A) or L-, T-, and R-type voltage-gated calcium (Cav) with 50 μM Ni2+ and 10 μM nimodipine (Figure 2B) channels had only marginal effects on the synaptic amplification. In contrast, partial block of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels by a relatively low (20 nM) concentration of tetrodotoxin (TTX) greatly reduced amplification in response to activation of EC or CA3 input, alone or together (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2A). We also tested the effects of phenytoin, another Nav channel blocker with a higher selectivity for the sustained component of sodium current (Kuo and Bean, 1994Kuo C.C. Bean B.P. Slow binding of phenytoin to inactivated sodium channels in rat hippocampal neurons.Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 716-725PubMed Google Scholar, Segal and Douglas, 1997Segal M.M. Douglas A.F.

Extracellular calcium modulates persistent sodium current-dependent burst-firing in hippocampal pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4173-4182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that partial block of Nav channels by phenytoin significantly reduced amplification (Figure S2B). These results indicate that a current mediated by Nav channels critically contributes to the amplification of synaptic responses. Consistent with previous work showing that low TTX had presynaptic effects during weak synaptic stimulation (Kim et al., 2015Kim Y. Hsu C.L. Cembrowski M.S. Mensh B.D. Spruston N. Dendritic sodium spikes are required for long-term potentiation at distal synapses on hippocampal pyramidal neurons.eLife. 2015; 4Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we observed a reduction (presumably presynaptic) of responses in low TTX for cells with relatively small baseline EPSPs (average peak response <1.6 mV in control, reduced to 39% of control, n = 3 neurons from 3 rats, and reduced to noise level for 2 additional neurons from 2 rats), but not for cells with larger baseline EPSPs (average peak response >1.6 mV in control, 108% of control, n = 2 neurons from 2 rats). Nevertheless, we attribute the strong effects of low TTX on synaptic amplification to a postsynaptic action (for a total of 5 neurons with identifiable EPSPs remaining in low TTX), for the following reasons. First, as discussed above, even very small synaptic responses (<0.5 mV at or near the resting Vm; e.g., Figure 1B) exhibit steeply voltage-dependent amplification. Although burst EPSPs were, on average, smaller in low TTX (average peak amplitude = 1.19 ± 0.48 mV, 66% of control, n = 5 neurons), these responses were similar to (or larger than) those from a subset of cells with relatively small baseline EPSPs in control (<1.19 mV, n = 8 neurons from 6 rats, average peak amplitude = 0.92 ± 0.08 mV), which were capable of strong synaptic amplification in the absence of TTX (amplification ratio: peak amplitude, 3.34 ± 0.52, integral, 5.49 ± 1.19). This argues against a role of reduced response size in the effects of TTX on voltage-dependent amplification. Second, the block of amplification by low TTX was very similar when comparing cells with no reduction of baseline EPSPs (108% of control; amplification ratio in low TTX: peak amplitude, 1.05 ± 0.03; integral, 1.40 ± 0.02) and cells with a reduction of baseline EPSPs (39% of control, because of the presynaptic effect; amplification ratio in low TTX: peak amplitude, 1.18 ± 0.21; integral, 1.72 ± 0.51). To further test whether the effective block of synaptic amplification by low TTX is indeed a postsynaptic rather than a presynaptic effect, we performed experiments with a low concentration of an intracellular Nav channel blocker, QX-314 (0.5 mM in the patch pipette). This concentration—approximately one order of magnitude lower than what is typically used (e.g., Palmer et al., 2014Palmer L.M. Shai A.S. Reeve J.E. Anderson H.L. Paulsen O. Larkum M.E. NMDA spikes enhance action potential generation during sensory input.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, Stuart and Sakmann, 1994Stuart G.J. Sakmann B. Active propagation of somatic action potentials into neocortical pyramidal cell dendrites.Nature. 1994; 367: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar)—was chosen to minimize confounding off-target effects, but it completely blocked synaptic amplification (Figure 3A). Furthermore, we found that intracellular low QX-314 abolished the non-inactivating component of the sodium current isolated in somatic whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (Figures 3B–3D) without completely blocking the large transient component in response to a voltage step to 0 mV (data not shown; see STAR Methods for details). Together, these data indicate that a postsynaptic voltage-gated sodium current is crucial for the steeply voltage-dependent amplification of temporally summated synaptic responses in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figure 2E) and that the sustained or persistent component may play a particularly important role. Although QX-314 is known to have off-target effects, the low concentration we used may reduce this concern; the consistency between the results of TTX and QX-314 makes block of Nav channels the parsimonious interpretation. Finally, we performed other experiments to eliminate alternative possibilities (Figure 2; see below). We combined a few experimental approaches to determine the cellular location of the synaptic amplification. First, instead of electrically stimulating afferent axonal fibers, which should synaptically activate channel conductances along the somato-dendritic axis, we simulated the arrival of synaptic current at the soma by injecting synaptic current-like waveforms via the patch electrode (“simulated EPSPs”). Second, we patched either the soma or the distal primary apical dendrite to compare amplification at different locations. Third, we activated synapses from different input pathways, which impinge upon different dendritic compartments. When synaptic responses were simulated in the perisomatic region by current injection, voltage-dependent amplification for simulated burst EPSPs and ramp EPSPs was robust across cells (for burst with inhibition blocked, 55 of 55 neurons from 47 rats; for ramp with inhibition blocked, 13 of 13 neurons from 12 rats; for ramp with inhibition intact, 5 of 5 neurons from 5 rats). The amplification of simulated responses was not significantly different from the amplification of synaptically activated responses, regardless of whether GABAergic inhibition was blocked (Figures 4A–4D and S1A; p > 0.05 by one-way or two-way ANOVA for all comparisons). Together with the experiment using low QX-314 (Figure 3A), these results support a postsynaptic amplification mechanism. Furthermore, because voltage strongly attenuates along the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neuron"
https://openalex.org/W2809230988,"N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is a non-human red-meat-derived sialic acid immunogenic to humans. Neu5Gc can be metabolically incorporated into glycan chains on human endothelial and epithelial surfaces. This represents the first example of a ""xeno-autoantigen"", against which circulating human ""xeno-autoantibodies"" can react. The resulting inflammation (""xenosialitis"") has been demonstrated in human-like Neu5Gc-deficient mice and contributed to carcinoma progression via antibody-mediated inflammation. Anti-Neu5Gc antibodies have potential as biomarkers for diseases associated with red meat consumption such as carcinomas, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes.ELISA assays measured antibodies against Neu5Gc or Neu5Gc-glycans in plasma or serum samples from the Nurses' Health Studies, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, including inter-assay reproducibility, stability with delayed sample processing, and within-person reproducibility over 1-3 years in archived samples. We also assessed associations between antibody levels and coronary artery disease risk (CAD) or red meat intake. A glycan microarray was used to detected antibodies against multiple Neu5Gc-glycan epitopes. A nested case-control study design assessed the association between total anti-Neu5Gc antibodies detected in the glycan array assay and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).ELISA assays showed a wide range of anti-Neu5Gc responses and good inter-assay reproducibility, stability with delayed sample processing, and within-person reproducibility over time, but these antibody levels did not correlate with CAD risk or red meat intake. Antibodies against Neu5Gc alone or against individual Neu5Gc-bearing epitopes were also not associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. However, a sialoglycan microarray study demonstrated positive association with CRC risk when the total antibody responses against all Neu5Gc-glycans were combined. Individuals in the top quartile of total anti-Neu5Gc IgG antibody concentrations had nearly three times the risk compared to those in the bottom quartile (Multivariate Odds Ratio comparing top to bottom quartile: 2.98, 95% CI: 0.80, 11.1; P for trend = 0.02).Further work harnessing the utility of these anti-Neu5Gc antibodies as biomarkers in red meat-associated diseases must consider diversity in individual antibody profiles against different Neu5Gc-bearing glycans. Traditional ELISA assays for antibodies directed against Neu5Gc alone, or against specific Neu5Gc-glycans may not be adequate to define risk associations. Our finding of a positive association of total anti-Neu5Gc antibodies with CRC risk also warrants confirmation in larger prospective studies."

However, a comprehensive analysis of AR expression within all breast cancer subtypes or stratified by race has not been reported. We assessed AR mRNA expression in 925 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 136 tumors in 2 confirmation sets. AR protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in 197 tumors from a multi-institutional cohort, for a total of 1258 patients analyzed. Cox hazard ratios were used to determine correlations to PAM50 breast cancer subtypes, and TNBC subtypes. Overall, AR-negative patients are diagnosed at a younger age compared to AR-positive patients, with the average age of AA AR-negative patients being, 49. AA breast tumors express AR at lower rates compared to Whites, independent of ER and PR expression (p<0.0001). AR-negative patients have a (66.60; 95% CI, 32-146) odds ratio of being basal-like compared to other PAM50 subtypes, and this is associated with an increased time to progression and decreased overall survival. AA ""QNBC"" patients predominately demonstrated BL1, BL2 and IM subtypes, with differential expression of E2F1, NFKBIL2, CCL2, TGFB3, CEBPB, PDK1, IL12RB2, IL2RA, and SOS1 genes compared to white patients. Immune checkpoint inhibitors PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 were significantly upregulated in both overall ""QNBC"" and AA ""QNBC"" patients as well.

Following this, a detailed nomenclature of BAs was elucidated. The quantification and distribution of amyrins (3-epi-α-amyrin, β-amyrin and α-amyrin) and BAs in different Boswellia resins showed highest amyrin and BAs in B. sacra as compared with B. serrata and B. papyrifera. Distribution of BAs significantly varied in the resin of B. sacra collected from dry mountains than coastal trees. In B. sacra, high content of α-amyrin was found in the roots but it lacked β-amyrin and BAs. The leaf part showed traces of β-ABA and AKBA but was deficient in amyrins. This was further confirmed by lack of transcript accumulation of amyrin-related biosynthesis gene in leaf part. In contrast, the stem showed presence of all six BAs which are attributed to existence of resin-secretory canals.

https://openalex.org/W2808112573,"miR-30 is a microRNA frequently overexpressed in human cancers. However, the biological consequence of miR-30 overexpression in cancer has been unclear. In a genetic screen, miR-30 was found to abrogate oncogenic-induced senescence, a key tumor-suppressing mechanism that involves DNA damage responses, activation of p53 and induction of p16INK4A. In cells and mouse models, miR-30 disrupts senescence and promotes cancer by suppressing 2 targets, CHD7 and TNRC6A. We show that while CHD7 is a transcriptional coactivator essential for induction of p16INK4A in senescent cells, TNRC6A, a miRNA machinery component, is required for expression and functionality of DNA damage response RNAs (DDRNAs) that mediate DNA damage responses and p53 activation by orchestrating histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and recruitment of DNA damage factors at damaged sites. Thus, miR-30 inhibits both p16INK4A and p53, 2 key senescence effectors, leading to efficient senescence disruption. These findings have identified novel signaling pathways mediating oncogene-induced senescence and tumor-suppression, and revealed the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic activity of miR-30. Thus, the miR-30/CHD7/TNRC6A pathway is potentially a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2809280648,"Background Negative symptoms are a core feature of schizophrenia and also found in healthy individuals in subclinical forms. According to the current literature the two negative symptom domains, apathy and diminished expression may have different underlying neural mechanisms. Previous observations suggest that striatal dysfunction is associated with apathy in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether apathy is specifically related to ventral or dorsal striatal alterations. Here, we investigated striatal dysfunction during reward anticipation in patients with schizophrenia and a non-clinical population, to determine whether it is associated with apathy. Methods Chronic schizophrenia patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 23) underwent an event- related functional MRI, while performing a variant of the Monetary Incentive Delay Task. The two negative symptom domains were assessed in both groups using the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale. Results In schizophrenia patients, we saw a strong negative correlation between apathy and ventral and dorsal striatal activation during reward anticipation. In contrast, there was no correlation with diminished expression. In healthy controls, apathy was not correlated with ventral or dorsal striatal activation during reward anticipation. Conclusion This study replicates our previous findings of a correlation between ventral striatal activity and apathy but not diminished expression in chronic schizophrenia patients. The association between apathy and reduced dorsal striatal activity during reward anticipation suggests that impaired action-outcome selection is involved in the pathophysiology of motivational deficits in schizophrenia."

In 2009, the prevalence of genital warts in Hong Kong was 203.7 per 100,000 person-years. Cervical cancer, more seriously, was the eight most common cancer among women and girls in Hong Kong, accounting for 2.3% of all new cancer cases in females in 2014. Cervical cancer is a significant global public health problem and HPV is a major risk factor leading to the development of cervical cancer. HPV is also the most common sexually transmitted disease among university students. This is the first study to examine the acceptability of HPV vaccines and associations with perceptions related to HPV and HPV vaccines among the male baccalaureate student population locally.A self-administrative cross-sectional survey was used to assess whether male baccalaureate students from eight local Hong Kong universities intended to be immunized for HPV. The study also asked questions concerning how its subjects perceived HPV and HPV vaccines using the Health Belief Model. Data collection spanned from June to September 2015. A multiple stepwise regression model was used to examine associations between cognitive factors and subjects' intention to take up the HPV vaccine.A total of 1,004 (83.7%) students aged 18 and 26 participated in this study. 23.3% found vaccinating for HPV acceptable, a level correlating with a number of indicators. Subjects were more likely to find vaccinating acceptable if 1) they knew something about HPV vaccines; 2) they understood that men were susceptible to infection by HPV; 3) they realised they could benefit by HPV vaccination, and 4) they were aware of the arguments for and against HPV vaccination, as disseminated by either the media or peers.HPV remains a significant public health concern in Hong Kong and China more broadly. This study's findings show a disconnect between the perceived and actual risk of being infected with the HPV vaccine among male baccalaureate students. This disconnect may be bridged by informing young men of the benefits of their being vaccinated against HPV, by removing the psychological and financial barriers that prevent them from taking up the vaccine and by improving how primary healthcare providers motivate them to get immunized."

We found that a greater proportion of households have personally experienced climate change, and were more likely to believe in human causation and believe that there is a scientific consensus about the issue. However, there was evidence of issue fatigue. Households were less likely to report that they had thought about climate change or talked about it with their friends in 2016 relative to 2011. They were also less likely to pursue certain climate friendly behaviours or reward or punish companies for their climate behaviours. These findings suggest a need to motivate households to maintain efforts to mitigate climate change, particularly the Cautious and Disengaged households that are more amenable to changing their views about this issue."
https://openalex.org/W2808945879,"Background Cumulative evidence indicates an association between maternal overweight and gestational diabetes with delayed breastfeeding initiation; however, the presence of both conditions simultaneously has been little explored. This study aims to investigate the interaction between maternal overweight/obesity and gestational diabetes on breastfeeding initiation. Methods This study comprises data from the IVAPSA Birth Cohort, a prospective follow-up of mothers and their newborns. Two of the five groups from IVAPSA were evaluated, considering women with and without gestational diabetes. These women were further categorized according to their pre-pregnancy body mass index as normal weight or overweight/obese. Results 219 women were evaluated, 53.4% of them had pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and 32% had gestational diabetes. Most women were able to initiate breastfeeding within 12 hours from delivery (92.7%) and only eight (3.7%) women had not breastfed in the first 24 hours postpartum. Of these, seven were overweight/obese (77.8%) and five had gestational diabetes (66.7%), with four of them having overweight/obesity and gestational diabetes concomitantly. Women with both adverse conditions had an adjusted relative risk of delayed breastfeeding initiation of 1.072 (95% CI 1.006; 1.141), p = 0.032. Conclusions The results indicate an additive interaction between maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity and gestational diabetes on delayed breastfeeding initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2809540542,"Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which is associated with cellular dysfunction, disease etiology, and senescence. Here, we used the eukaryotic model Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly studied for cellular aging, to demonstrate how defective mitochondrial function affects yeast replicative lifespan (RLS). We show that RLS of respiratory-deficient cells decreases significantly, indicating that the maintenance of RLS requires active respiration. The shortening of RLS due to mitochondrial dysfunction was not related to the accumulation of extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles, a well-known cause of aging in yeast. Instead, intracellular ROS and oxidatively damaged proteins increased in respiratory-deficient mutants. We show that, while the protein kinase A activity is not elevated, ROS generation in respiratory-deficient cells depends on RAS signaling pathway. The ER-localized NADPH oxidase Yno1 also played a role in producing ROS. Our data suggest that a severe defect in mitochondrial respiration accelerates cellular aging by disturbing protein homeostasis in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2785351312,"The ratchet effect-the gradual accumulation of changes within a cultural trait beyond a level that individuals can achieve on their own-arguably rests on two key cognitive abilities: high-fidelity social learning and innovation. Researchers have started to simulate the ratchet effect in the laboratory to identify its underlying social learning mechanisms, but studies on the developmental origins of the ratchet effect remain sparse. We used the transmission chain method and a tower construction task that had previously been used with adults to investigate whether ""generations"" of children between 4 and 6 years were able to make a technological product that individual children could not yet achieve. 21 children in a baseline and 80 children in transmission chains (each consisting of 10 successive children) were asked to build something as tall as possible from plasticine and sticks. Children in the chains were presented with the constructions of the two preceding generations (endstate demonstration). Results showed that tower heights did not increase across the chains nor were they different from the height of baseline towers, demonstrating a lack of improvement in tower height. However, we found evidence for cultural lineages, i.e., construction styles: towers within chains were more similar to each other than to towers from different chains. Possible explanations for the findings and directions for future research are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2809602877,"Neuraxial anesthesia (spinal and epidural anesthesia) procedures have significant learning curves and have been traditionally taught at the bed side, exposing patients to the increased risk associated with procedures done by novices. Simulation based medical education allows trainees to repeatedly practice and hone their skills prior to patient interaction. Wide-spread adoption of simulation-based medical education for procedural teaching has been slow due to the expense and limited variety of commercially available phantoms. Free/Libre/open-source (FLOS) software and desktop 3D printing technologies has enabled the fabrication of low-cost, patient-specific medical phantoms. However, few studies have evaluated the performance of these devices compared to commercially available phantoms. This paper describes the fabrication of a low-cost 3D printed neuraxial phantom based on computed tomorography (CT) scan data, and expert validation data comparing this phantom to a commercially available model. Methods Anonymized CT DICOM data was segmented to create a 3D model of the lumbar spine. The 3D model was modified, placed inside a digitally designed housing unit and fabricated on a desktop 3D printer using polylactic acid (PLA) filament. The model was filled with an echogenic solution of gelatin with psyllium fiber. Twenty-two staff anesthesiologists performed a spinal and epidural on the 3D printed simulator and a commercially available Simulab phantom. Participants evaluated the tactile and ultrasound imaging fidelity of both phantoms via Likert-scale questionnaire. Results The 3D printed neuraxial phantom cost $13 to print and required 25 hours of non-supervised printing and 2 hours of assembly time. The 3D printed phantom was found to be less realistic to surface palpation than the Simulab phantom due to fragility of the silicone but had significantly better fidelity for loss of resistance, dural puncture and ultrasound imaging than the Simulab phantom. Conclusion Low-cost neuraxial phantoms with fidelity comparable to commercial models can be produced using CT data and low-cost infrastructure consisting of FLOS software and desktop 3D printers."
https://openalex.org/W2808159496,"GPCR kinase 2–interacting protein-1 (GIT1) is a scaffold protein that plays an important role in cell adaptation, proliferation, migration, and differentiation; however, the role of GIT1 in the regulation of neuronal death after spinal cord injury remains obscure. Here, we demonstrate that GIT1 deficiency remarkably increased neuronal apoptosis and enhanced JNK/p38 signaling, which resulted in stronger motor deficits by ischemia-reperfusion in vivo, consistent with the finding of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation–induced neuronal injury in vitro. After treatment with JNK and p38 inhibitors, abnormally necroptotic cell death caused by GIT1 knockdown could be partially rescued, with the recovery of neuronal viability, which was still poorer than that in control neurons. Meanwhile, overactivation of JNK/p38 after GIT1 depletion was concomitant with excessive activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) that could be abolished by ASK1 silencing in HEK293T cells. Finally, GIT1 could disrupt the oligomerization of ASK1 via interaction between the synaptic localization domain that contains the coiled-coil (CC)-2 domain of GIT1 and the C-terminal CC domain of ASK1. It suppressed the autophosphorylation of ASK1 and led to decreasing activity of the ASK1/JNK/p38 pathway. These data reveal a protective role for GIT1 in neuronal damage by modulating ASK1/JNK/p38 signaling.—Chen, J., Wang, Q., Zhou, W., Zhou, Z., Tang, P.-Y., Xu, T., Liu, W., Li, L.-W., Cheng, L., Zhou, Z.-M., Fan, J., Yin, G.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2809429044,"This work describes the production of lipases from endophytic fungi: Vermisporium-like, Emericella nidulans, Dichotomophtora portulacae and D. boerhaaviae and the biological activity against the dermatophyte fungi Malassezia sp and Microsporum canis and the parasite Leishmania amazonensis. All fungal enzymes extract showed lipolysis action in the media that contains long carbon chain lipids. The proteomic analysis of lipases exhibits several molecules mostly ranging in size from 220 to 20 kDa, with clear differences in protein profile’s yield. All fungal enzymes were competent to eliminate promastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis at 5 mg.mL-1. The antileishmanial activity of lipases from Vermisporium-like, E. nidulans, D. portulacae and D. boerhaaviae in amastigote forms, promoted the reduction in viability of 78.88, 39.65, 63.17 and 98.13%, with selectivity index of 19.56, 30.68, 18.09 and 20.99. In relation to antifungal activity, Dichothomophtora enzymes demonstrate best action with MFC of 14.65 μg.mL-1 against Malassezia sp and Microsporum canis, respectively. These results allow us to infer that lipases from entophytic fungi displays activity against dermatophyte fungi (Malassezia sp. and Microsporum canis) as well as Leishmania."
https://openalex.org/W2809609410,"Self-sampling to test for high risk human papilloma virus (HPV) is becoming an increasingly important component of cervical cancer screening. The aim of this observational study is to examine how women treated for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) view HPV self-sampling.Invited to participate in the present study were patients who had undergone treatment of high-grade CIN (grade 2 or higher) and were followed-up at 6-months at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm. The participants were instructed as to how to perform HPV self-sampling. Thereafter, the participants completed a questionnaire about HPV self-sampling and other cervical cancer screening methods, as well as about self-perceived risk of cervical cancer without regular gynecologic follow-up and about specific knowledge regarding HPV, CIN and cervical cancer.Altogether 479 women enrolled in this study. The participation rate was 96.6%. Nearly 75% of the participants stated they would consider performing the HPV self-sampling prior to their next gynecologic follow-up. Confidence in HPV self-sampling was a significant independent predictor of willingness to perform HPV self-sampling. However, confidence in HPV self-sampling was significantly lower than confidence in Papanicolaou smears and in HPV testing with samples collected by health professionals. Higher specific knowledge about HPV, CIN and cervical cancer was also a significant independent predictor of willingness to perform HPV self-sampling, as was having travelled longer distance to attend gynecologic follow-up. Participants with lower income and without completed university education expressed significantly higher confidence in HPV self-sampling and lower confidence in Papanicolaou smears than the other women.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the views of women treated for high-grade CIN vis-à-vis HPV self-sampling. The latter is an acceptable option for the vast majority of this cohort of women."
https://openalex.org/W2809152613,"Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen, and the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. We have recently shown that immunization with the highly conserved antigenic passenger domain of recombinant Ct polymorphic membrane protein D (rPmpD) is protective in the mouse model of Ct genital tract infection, and previously, that ocular anti-rPmpD antibodies are elicited following vaccination. However, the mechanisms governing the assembly and structure-function relationship of PmpD are unknown. Here, we provide a biophysical analysis of this immunogenic 65 kDa passenger domain fragment of PmpD. Using differential cysteine labeling coupled with LC-MS/MS analysis, we show that widespread intra- and intermolecular disulphide interactions play important roles in the preservation of native monomeric secondary structure and the formation of higher-order oligomers. While it has been proposed that FxxN and GGA(I, L,V) repeat motifs in the Pmp21 ortholog in Chlamydia pneumoniae mediate self-interaction, no such role has previously been identified for cysteine residues in chlamydial Pmps. Further characterisation reveals that oligomeric proteoforms and rPmpD monomers adopt β–sheet folds, consistent with previously described Gram-negative bacterial type V secretion systems (T5SSs). We also highlight adhesin-like properties of rPmpD, showing that both soluble rPmpD and anti-rPmpD serum from immunized mice abrogate binding of rPmpD-coated beads to mammalian cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Hence, our study provides further evidence that chlamydial Pmps may function as adhesins, while elucidating yet another important mechanism of self-association of bacterial T5SS virulence factors that may be unique to the Chlamydiaceae."
https://openalex.org/W2809172938,"The conventional technique for the fabrication of complete dentures is complex, with a long fabrication process and difficult-to-control restoration quality. In recent years, digital complete denture design has become a research focus. Digital complete denture tooth arrangement is a challenging issue that is difficult to efficiently implement under the constraints of complex tooth arrangement rules and the patient’s individualized functional aesthetics. The present study proposes a complete denture automatic tooth arrangement method driven by a reconfigurable rule; it uses four typical operators, including a position operator, a scaling operator, a posture operator, and a contact operator, to establish the constraint mapping association between the teeth and the constraint set of the individual patient. By using the process reorganization of different constraint operators, this method can flexibly implement different clinical tooth arrangement rules. When combined with a virtual occlusion algorithm based on progressive iterative Laplacian deformation, the proposed method can achieve automatic and individual tooth arrangement. Finally, the experimental results verify that the proposed method is flexible and efficient."
https://openalex.org/W2808725650,"Massive expansion of a DNA hexanucleotide sequence repeat (C2G4) within the human C9orf72 gene has been linked to a number of neurodegenerative diseases. In sodium or potassium salt solutions, single-stranded d(C2G4)n DNAs fold to form G-quadruplexes. We have found that in magnesium or lithium salt solutions, especially under slightly acidic conditions, d(C2G4)n oligonucleotides fold to form a distinctive higher order structure whose most striking feature is an ""inverted"" circular dichroism spectrum, which is distinguishable from the spectrum of the left handed DNA double-helix, Z-DNA. On the basis of CD spectroscopy, gel mobility as well as chemical protection analysis, we propose that this structure, which we call ""iCD-DNA"", may be a left-handed Hoogsteen base-paired duplex, an unorthodox G-quadruplex/i-motif composite, or a non-canonical, ""braided"" DNA triplex. Given that iCD-DNA forms under slightly acidic solution conditions, we do not know at this point in time whether or not it forms within living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2809362811,"Nowadays, ride-hailing services have been established as a part of the urban transportation. Their arrival has remade the profit structure and resulted in the unbalance of interest in taxi market. Here, we establish the service models of taxis, carpooling, and car-hailing under ""Internet +"" from the perspective of profit margins, to perform a comparative analysis among the different services.First, Profit margins are generally higher for short trips than for long trips, though empty cruise fee to a certain degree make up for the driver's decreased profit margins. Second, the profit margin for carpooling is roughly 1.85 times that of ride-hailing, and 1.75 times that of taxis. This shows that the sharing economy has a certain advantage. Third, Profit margins are higher and fluctuations are lower on non-work days than on work days. At last, Profit margins are roughly 1.3 times higher on non-congested roads than on congested roads. The reduced profitability on congested roads makes it even harder to catch a ride during rush hours and on congested roads. We suggest that the relevant departments make appropriate efforts to make it more attractive for drivers to take on passengers during rush hours and on congested roads, and promote the sharing in the taxi market."

In recent years there has been a divergence of serotype A viruses in South East Asia (SEA) into several distinct genetic and antigenic clusters. Numerous variants were found to poorly match serotype A vaccines commonly included in international antigen banks.

https://openalex.org/W2809216420,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a rare form of cancer across the world except in certain areas such as Southern China, Hong Kong and Malaysia. NPC is considered a relatively radiosensitive tumor and patients diagnosed at early stages tend to survive longer compared to those with advanced disease. Given that early symptoms of NPC are non-specific and that the nasopharynx is relatively inaccessible, less invasive screening methods such as biomarker screening might be the key to improve NPC survival and management. A number of genes with their respective polymorphisms have been shown in past studies to be associated with survival of various cancers. hOGG1 and XPD genes encode for a DNA glycosylase and a DNA helicase respectively; both are proteins that are involved in DNA repair. ITGA2 is the alpha subunit of the transmembrane receptor integrin and is mainly responsible for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interaction. TNF-α is a cytokine that is released by immune cells during inflammation.Restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) was used to genotype all the aforementioned gene polymorphisms. Kaplan-Meier survival function, log-rank test and Cox regression were used to investigate the effect of gene polymorphisms on the all-cause survival of NPC.NPC cases carrying T/T genotype of ITGA2 C807T have poorer all-cause survival compared to those with C/C genotypes, with an adjusted HR of 2.06 (95% CI = 1.14-3.72) in individual model. The 5-year survival rate of C/C carriers was 55% compared to those with C/T and T/T where the survival rates were 50% and 43%, respectively.The finding from the present study showed that ITGA2 C807T polymorphism could be potentially useful as a prognostic biomarker for NPC. However, the prognostic value of ITGA2 C807T polymorphism has to be validated by well-designed further studies with larger patient numbers."

Based on the SFI-ASM, a novel model is proposed to make agents more close to the real world. Agents are divided into four kinds in terms of different learning speeds, strategy-sizes, utility functions, and level of intelligence; and a crucial parameter has been found to ensure system stability. So, some parameters are appended to make the model which contains zero-intelligent and less-intelligent agents run steadily. Moreover, considering real stock markets change violently due to the financial crisis; the real stock markets are divided into two segments, before the financial crisis and after it. The optimal modified model before the financial crisis fails to replicate the statistical features of the real market after the financial crisis. Then, the optimal model after the financial crisis is shown. The experiments indicate that the optimal model after the financial crisis is able to replicate several of real market phenomena, including the first-order autocorrelation, kurtosis, standard deviation of yield series and first-order autocorrelation of yield square. We point out that there is a structural change in stock markets after the financial crisis, which can benefit people forecast the financial crisis."
https://openalex.org/W2808931225,"Cost-sensitive feature selection learning is an important preprocessing step in machine learning and data mining. Recently, most existing cost-sensitive feature selection algorithms are heuristic algorithms, which evaluate the importance of each feature individually and select features one by one. Obviously, these algorithms do not consider the relationship among features. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for minimal cost feature selection called the rough sets and Laplacian score based cost-sensitive feature selection. The importance of each feature is evaluated by both rough sets and Laplacian score. Compared with heuristic algorithms, the proposed algorithm takes into consideration the relationship among features with locality preservation of Laplacian score. We select a feature subset with maximal feature importance and minimal cost when cost is undertaken in parallel, where the cost is given by three different distributions to simulate different applications. Different from existing cost-sensitive feature selection algorithms, our algorithm simultaneously selects out a predetermined number of “good” features. Extensive experimental results show that the approach is efficient and able to effectively obtain the minimum cost subset. In addition, the results of our method are more promising than the results of other cost-sensitive feature selection algorithms."

However, the neural structures underlying the continued management of mental effort are not known. Previous work has identified left-lateralized structures, most prominently the left anterior Insular Cortex (aIC) as regions implied in post-hoc evaluation and also anticipation of mental effort investment. We present a study aimed at identifying neural structures that are sensitive to changes in both task load and fatigue-induced state load. Sixteen healthy participants performed an n-back task before and after a fatigue-inducing day in a helicopter simulator or a free day. Subjective mental effort ratings showed an interaction of the effects of both task and state load changes, with a reduced effect of task load during the fatigued state. Testing for the same interaction effect in a whole-brain functional MRI data, we found a left-lateralized group of clusters in aIC, the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal striatum and frontal eye field and M1. We discuss the possible role of these areas and also the relevance of our findings in the light of the proposed opportunity cost model of mental effort."
https://openalex.org/W2809617422,"Focal brain ischemia markedly affects cerebrovascular reactivity. So far, these changes have mainly been related to alterations in the level of smooth muscle cell function while alterations of the endothelial lining have not yet been studied in detail. We have, therefore, investigated the effects of ischemia/reperfusion injury on bradykinin (BK)-induced relaxation since BK is an important mediator of tissue inflammation and affects vascular function in an endothelium-dependent manner. Focal brain ischemia was induced in rats by endovascular filament occlusion (2h) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 22h reperfusion, both MCAs were harvested and the response to BK studied in organ bath experiments. Expression of the BK receptor subtypes 1 and 2 (B1, B2) was determined by real-time semi-quantitative RT-qPCR methodology, and whole mount immunofluorescence staining was performed to show the B2 receptor protein expression. In control animals, BK did not induce significant vasomotor effects despite a functionally intact endothelium and robust expression of B2 mRNA. After ischemia/reperfusion injury, BK induced a concentration-related sustained relaxation in all arteries studied, more pronounced in the ipsilateral than in the contralateral MCA. The B2 mRNA was significantly upregulated and the B1 mRNA displayed de novo expression, again more pronounced ipsi- than contralaterally. Endothelial cells displaying B2 receptor immunofluorescence were observed scattered or clustered in previously occluded MCAs. Relaxation to BK was mediated by B2 receptor activation, abolished after endothelium denudation, and largely diminished by blocking nitric oxide (NO) release or soluble guanylyl cyclase activity. Relaxation to BK was partially inhibited by charybdotoxin (ChTx), but not apamin or iberiotoxin suggesting activation of an endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization pathway. When the NO-cGMP pathway was blocked, BK induced a transient relaxation which was suppressed by ChTx. After ischemia/reperfusion injury BK elicits endothelium-dependent relaxation which was not detectable in control MCAs. This gain of function is mediated by B2 receptor activation and involves the release of NO and activation of an endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization. It goes along with increased B2 mRNA and protein expression, leaving the functional role of the de novo B1 receptor expression still open."
https://openalex.org/W2809139942,"Short tandem repeats (STR) are usually used as informative polymorphic markers for genetic mapping and for disease susceptibility analysis. The involvement of these microsatellite markers localized in the MHC region was reported in many auto-immune diseases. In this study we analyzed for the first time eight polymorphisms of microsatellite loci at the HLA region: D6S291, D6S273, TNFa, b and c, MICA, D6S265 and D6S276, in Tunisian systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients.We performed a case control study in which the microsatellite loci were amplified using specific primers labeled with NED, VIC, PET or 6-FAM and analyzed using GeneScan software 3.7. For the statistical analysis, we used SPSS software and we performed a sub-haplotype scoring test using the haplo.stats software developed in the R language.We found that two mean associated regions existed; the most statistically significant encompassed the 3 TNF markers (p = 0.0003, OR = 19.34); the latter covered the DR region. In fact, when scoring haplotypes in 3 marker- sliding windows, the p value increased as we moved away from the TNF region and decreased again when we approached the DRB1 locus. We also established for the first time the negative association between alleles of D6S291 and SLE. The majority of clinical and serological correlations were noted with TNF alleles.Our results confirm the association between TNF and DRB1 polymorphisms and SLE. The association between alleles of D6S291 and SLE needs however to be verified by the analysis of other markers beyond this region."

We demonstrate how geospatial analysis can be performed with commonly available data to identify areas with the greatest unmet demand for HCV services.We performed an Australia-wide cross-sectional analysis of 2015 HCV notification rates using local government areas (LGAs) as our unit of analysis. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to determine associations between notification rates and socioeconomic/demographic factors, health service and geographic remoteness area (RA) classification variables. Additionally, component scores were extracted from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the healthcare service variables to provide rankings of relative service coverage and unmet demand across Australia.Among LGAs with non-zero notifications, higher rates were associated with areas that had increased socioeconomic disadvantage, more needle and syringe services (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.022; 95%CI 1.001, 1.044) and more alcohol and other drug services (IRR 1.019; 1.005, 1.034). The distribution of PCA component scores indicated that per-capita healthcare service coverage was lower in areas outside of major Australian cities. Areas outside of major cities also contained 94% of LGAs in the lowest two socioeconomic quintiles, as well as 35% of HCV notifications despite only representing 29% of the population.As countries aim for HCV elimination, routinely collected data can be used to identify geographical areas for priority service delivery. In Australia, the unmet demand for HCV treatment services is greatest in socioeconomically disadvantaged and non-metropolitan areas."
