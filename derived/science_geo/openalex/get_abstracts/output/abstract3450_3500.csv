https://openalex.org/W2084179103,"A DNA-protein complex from human adenoviruses has been further characterized by electron microscopy, radiochemical labeling and analytical ultracentrifugation. Preparations of the complex contain a large percentage of forms of DNA which are either circular or oligomeric and are readily distinguishable from preparations of pronase-treated adenovirus DNA by analytical ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride gradients containing 4 M guanidinium chloride. The protein component has been iodinated in vitro with 125I using Bolton and Hunter reagent, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of the labeled protein indicates that it has an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 daltons. DNAase I digestion of the DNA-protein complex labeled with 32PO4 results in release of a 32PO4-labeled protein which remains labeled even after boiling in 1% SDS and 1% mercaptoethanol. Subsequent digestion of this entity with snake venom phosphodiesterase leads to release of 32P4-labeled 5′-phosphate deoxynucleotides. Digestion of the DNA-protein complex with Eco R1 and analysis of the isolated restriction fragments indicates that the protein is present on each terminal fragment. We conclude that there is a protein of 55,000 daltons directly attached to each 5′ end of molecule probably via a covalent linkage. We propose that the protein functions during DNA replication by facilitating priming of the progeny strands, thus allowing the 5′ ends of the DNA to be replicated."

https://openalex.org/W2002733795,"Abstract Following transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) by avian RNA tumor viruses, two membrane polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 90,000 and 75,000 daltons have been found to be increased (Stone, Smith and Joklik, 1974). We find that this alteration in membrane proteins is not directly related to transformation. The 90,000 and 75,000 dalton proteins are present in increased amounts in a 3T3 fibroblast mutant (AD6) defective in glycoprotein synthesis. Feeding the mutant N-acetylglucosamine, a metabolite that bypasses the metabolic block, restores the amount of these two proteins to the levels found in normal cells. The 75,000 dalton protein is markedly reduced, and the 90,000 dalton protein disappears and is replaced by a fully glycosylated derivative with a molecular weight of 92,000 daltons. Two glucose derivatives, glucosamine and 2-deoxyglucose, are known to interfere with the glycosylation process. The addition of these substances to normal CEF and 3T3 cells specifically induces the accumulation of the 90,000 and 75,000 dalton membrane polypeptides. Finally, the deprivation of glucose for 24–48 hr also induces the synthesis of the 90,000 and 75,000 dalton polypeptides in normal fibroblasts. The induction of these two proteins by glucose starvation suggests that they have a role in glucose utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2087586256,"We have used two experimental strategies to test the role of cellular functions in the synthesis and integration of virus-specific DNA in cells infected by avian sarcoma virus. First, quail embryo fibroblasts, placed in stationary phase (G0) by prolonged serum starvation, did not support the efficient synthesis of viral DNA during the first 24–48 hr after infection. Synthesis of viral DNA was impaired according to at least two parameters: the amount of DNA was diminished, particularly the amount of the plus-strand DNA (identical in polarity to the viral genome); and the length of both minus and plus strands was reduced in the stationary cells. In parallel cultures fed with fresh serum, over two thirds of the cells were able to reenter the cell cycle within 24 hr, and viral DNA of normal size was synthesized. Second, density labeling of viral and cellular DNA with BUdR was used to determine whether cellular DNA synthesis was required for integration of viral DNA. In both quail embryo fibroblasts released from G0 by serum replacement and randomly growing duck embryo fibroblasts, viral DNA was integrated only into cellular DNA replicated during the infection. Our results indicate that serum-starved cells lack a factor (or factors) required for the efficient and complete synthesis of ASV-specific DNA. We have not been able to establish whether such factor(s) are present in growing cells only during S phase. Integration of viral DNA appears to require cellular DNA synthesis; this may be due to a requirement for a factor (or factors) present in adequate concentration only during S phase or to a requirement for the structural changes in cellular DNA that accompany replication."
https://openalex.org/W2014172562,"The major cell surface glycoprotein of cultured chick embryo fibroblasts (CSP, a LETS protein) is substantially decreased after neoplastic transformation. We investigated the regulation of this glycoprotein by determining the kinetics of CSP biosynthesis, transit to the cell surface, and degradation before and after transformation by Rous sarcoma virus. CSP synthesis, as measured by immunoprecipitation after pulse-labeling with 14C-leucine, is decreased 3–6 fold after transformation by the Bryan high titer, Schmidt-Ruppin and temperature-sensitive ts68 and T5 strains of Rous sarcoma virus. Steady state quantities of CSP in intracellular pools are also decreased 4–5 fold after transformation. However, the rate at which newly synthesized CSP is processed and exported to the cell surface is similar before and after transformation. Degradation and release of CSP from cells were measured after labeling for 24 hr. The half-life of CSP on normal cells is 36 hr and is decreased to 16–26 hr after transformation. The absolute amount of intact CSP released into the culture medium is decreased 3 fold after transformation; these amounts, however, represent losses of approximately 20 and 40% of the total CSP synthesized by normal and transformed cells, respectively. These results indicate that the major mechanism for the decrease in CSP after transformation is reduction in its biosynthesis, although increased degradation and loss from the cell surface also contribute significantly. These changes can account for the observed 5–6 fold decreases in cell-associated CSP after transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts."

https://openalex.org/W1985534773,"The presence of the extracellular matrix synthesized by chondroblasts provides a barrier to virus penetration. Chondroblasts can be infected and transformed following treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Using a temperature-sensitive transformation mutant of Rous sarcoma virus and rearing the cells at permissive temperature, we demonstrate that transformed chondroblasts stop synthesizing their cell-unique sulfated proteoglycan. If such transformed chondroblasts are shifted to nonpermissive temperature, the cells reinitiate the synthesis of their cell-unique sulfated proteoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2120331014,"Two protein bands, present in cytosol fractions from each of seven rat tissues examined, specifically incorporated 32P-labeled 8-azidoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-N3-[32P]cAMP), a photoaffinity label for cAMP-binding sites. These proteins had apparent molecular weights of 47,000 and 54,000 on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. These two proteins were characterized in three of the tissues, namely, heart, uterus, and liver, by the total amount of 8-N3-[32P]cAMP incorporation, by the dissociation constant (Kd) for 8-N3-[32P]cAMP, and by the nucleotide specific inhibition of 8-N3-[32P]cAMP incorporation. Several lines of evidence were obtained that the protein with an apparent molecular weight of 47,000 represents the regulatory subunit of a type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase, while the protein with an apparent molecular weight of 54,000 represents the regulatory subunit of a type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Almost all of the cAMP receptor protein found in the cytosol of these tissues, as measured by 8-N3-[32P]cAMP incorporation, was associated with these two protein kinases, in agreement with the idea that most effects of cAMP are mediated through protein kinases. The photoaffinity labeling with 8-N3-[32P]cAMP can be used to estimate quantitatively the amounts of regulatory subunit of type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinases in various tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2016902691,"The subcellular compartments have been investigated to compare proteins capable of binding triiodothyronine and thyroxine; specific binders have been found in cytosol, nuclei, and mitochondria from rat liver and kidney. The binding protein from the inner mitochondrial membrane had the highest association constant (greater than 10(11) liters per mole), suggesting possible direct hormone action on the mitochondria. Binding of hormone analogs was found to be related to known physiological potency, and stereospecific discrimination between L- and D-thyroxine was observed. The saturable receptor was found in the mitochondrial membranes of rat liver, kidney, myocardium, and skeletal muscle but not in mitochondria from the unresponsive tissues: brain, spleen, and testis. Oxidative phosphorylation by mitochondrial vesicles from hypothyroid rats increased after the addition of physiological concentrations of triiodothyronine, which corroborated direct hormone action on mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W1964328905,"Retinal melanoblasts were transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (ts-RSV). At the permissive temperature for transformation, the cells cease melanin synthesis, degrade their melanosomes and release much of their accumulated melanin into the medium. At the nonpermissive temperature, the cells assume an epithelioid morphology, actively synthesize melanin and become difficult to distinguish from normal uninfected control cultures. Both the transformed phenotype and the differentiated cell phenotype are temperature-dependent. Infected retinal melanoblasts which are incubated at the nonpermissive temperature and which accumulate a large amount of melanin are unable to transform in response to a temperature shift; instead, the cells degenerate and die. Retinal melanoblasts can be infected by subgroups A, B, C and D of RSV; however, their level of susceptibility to infection is about 1/40 compared to fibroblasts. Cultures infected by ts-RSV produce virus at both temperatures, suggesting that cell phenotype does not regulate virus synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2409552843,"Adenylate cyclase in liver membranes was solubilized with Lubrol PX and partially purified by gel filtration. The partially purified enzyme was susceptible to activation by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). Studies on the binding of [3H]Gpp(NH)p to various fractions eluted from the gels revealed that an upper limit of 1% of the Gpp(NH)p binding sites is associated with adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by the nucleotide. The glucagon receptor, pretagged with 125I-glucagon in the membranes, solubilized with Lubrol PX, and fractionated on the same gel columns, eluted in a peak fraction that overlaps with, but is separate from, adenylate cyclase in its Gpp(NH)p-stimulated form. Addition of GTP to the solubilized glucagon-receptor complex caused complete dissociation of the complex, as has been shown with the membrane-bound form of the complex. Since the GTP-sensitive form of the glucagon receptor complex separates from the Gpp(NH)p-sensitive form of adenylate cyclase, it is concluded that the receptor and the enzyme are separate molecules, each associated with a distinct nucleotide regulatory site or component. These findings are discussed in terms of the possible structure of the hormone-sensitive state of adenylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W1528621273,"Abstract cGMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine lung has been purified to homogeneity using 8-(2-aminoethyl)-amino adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate/Sepharose. Conditions for adsorption of holoenzyme to the affinity chromatography media followed by competitive ligand elution with cGMP have been determined. The holoenzyme of 150,000 molecular weight is composed of two 74,000 molecular weight subunits which are linked in part by disulfide bridges. Two moles of cGMP are bound per mol of holoenzyme compatible with 1 mol of cGMP/monomer. Dissociation of subunits does not occur upon cGMP binding and protein kinase activation. cGMP-dependent protein kinase has an isoelectric point of 5.4 and a Stokes radius of 50 A. The enzyme is asymmetric with an f/f0 of 1.42 and an axial ratio of 7.4. Determination of enzyme activity at varying concentrations of ATP revealed that cGMP increased the Vmax for ATP without significant effect on the Km. The purified enzyme was maximally active at 5 mM Mg2+; other divalent cations could not substitute for Mg2+. In the presence of Mg2+, strong inhibitory effects of other cations were observed with Mn2+, greater than Zn2+, greater than Co2+ greater than Ca2+. Although maximal cGMP-dependence was observed at pH 5.7 to 7.0, basal activity rose at higher pH values to approach activity observed with cGMP. A molecular model comparing cGMP-dependent protein kinase with cAMP-dependnet protein kinase is presented."

https://openalex.org/W2091736335,"The replication patterns of five ecotropic and two amphotropic strains of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) were studied by infecting 41 Chinese hamster x mounse hybrid primary clones segregating mouse (Mus musculus) chromosomes. Ecotropic and amphotropic strains replicated in mouse and some hybrid cells, but not in hamster cells, indicating that replication of exogenous virus requires dominantly expressed mouse cellular genes. The patterns of replication of the five ecotropic strains in hybrid clones were similar; the patterns of replication of the two amphotropic strains were also similar. When compared to each other, however, the replication patterns of ecotropic and amphotropic viruses were dissimilar, indicating that these two classes of MuLV require different mouse chromosomes for replication. Chromosome and isozyme analyses assigned a gene, Rec-1 (replication of ecotropic virus), to mouse chromosome 5 that is necessary and may be sufficient for ecotropic virus replication. Because of preferential retention of mouse chromosomes 15 and 17 in the hybrid clones, however, the possibility that these chromosomes carry genes that are necessary but not sufficient for ecotropic virus replication cannot be excluded. Similarly, the data indicate that mouse chromosome 8 (or possibly 19) carried a gene we have designated Ram-1 (replication of amphotropic virus) which is necessary and may be sufficient for amphotropic virus replication. Because chromosomes 8 and 19 tended to segregate together and two of the three clones excluding 19 have chromosome reaggrangements, we cannot exclude 19 as being independent of amphotropic virus replication. In addition, because of preferential retention, chromosomes 7, 12, 15, 16 and 17 cannot be excluded as being necessary but not sufficient. Hybrid cell genetic studies confirm the assignment of the Fv-1 locus to chromosome 4 previously made by sexual genetics. In addition, our results demonstrate that hybrid cells which have segregated mouse chromosome 4 but have retained 5 become permissive for replication of both N and B tropic strains of MuLV."

https://openalex.org/W1964056588,"T1026, a ts mutant of VSV which is much less cytopathogenic than its parent, HR, and which can establish persistent infection under certain conditions is a double mutant. In addition to its ts mutation in the virion RNA polymerase, T1026 has a second non-ts mutation in a viral function termed “P.” This function is responsible for the inhibition of total protein synthesis in infected cells and acts chiefly at the level of translational initiation. In some cell systems, the inhibition of protein synthesis produced by P appears to be selective for cellular protein synthesis, whereas in other cell systems, both cellular and viral protein synthesis are inhibited. T1026 and its ts revertants are phenotypically P−—that is, cells infected with them show total protein synthesis rates equal to or greater than uninfected cells, while synthesizing viral proteins at the same or even greater rates than HR-infected cells. The P− mutation is correlated with failure to increase plaque size after 2–3 days of incubation. Since viral mutants obtained from persistently infected cultures in a variety of systems appear to be double mutants with a ts mutation in the virion RNA polymerase and a small plaque marker, we suggest that T1026 could represent a model for such mutants."

All ganglion cells tested responded to the depolarizing action of ACh, whereas less than half of the cells that responded to ACh were hyperpolarized by dopamine. This effect was blocked by low concentrations of haloperidol. None of the cells examined responded to dbcAMP applied by iontophoresis. Hence, the present result is not consistent with the concept that a cyclic AMP mechanism underlies the hyperpolarizing effect of dopamine."

https://openalex.org/W1987668921,"Abstract DNA fragments containing monkey DNA sequences have been isolated from defective SV40 genomes that carry host sequences in place of portions of the SV40 genome. The fragments were isolated by restriction endonuclease cleavage and contain segments homologous to sequences in both the highly repetitive and unique (or less repetitive) classes of monkey DNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of one such fragment [151 base pairs (bp)] predominantly homologous to the highly reiterated class of monkey DNA was determined using both RNA and DNA sequencing methods. The nucleotide sequence of this homogeneous DNA segment does not contain discernible multiple internal repeating units but only a few short oligonucleotide repeats. The reiteration frequency of the sequence in the monkey genome is >10 6 . Digestion of total monkey DNA (from uninfected cells) with endonuclease R Hind III produces relatively large amounts of discrete DNA fragments that contain extensive regions homologous to the fragment isolated from the defective SV40 DNA. A second fragment, also containing monkey sequences, was isolated from the same defective substituted SV40 genome. The nucleotide sequence of the 33 bp of this second fragment that are contiguous to the 151 bp fragment has also been determined. The sequences in both fragments are also present in other, independently derived, defective substituted SV40 genomes."

https://openalex.org/W1501095220,"Prostaglandins (PG) of the E series and catecholamines stimulate adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) formation in human astrocytoma cells (1321N1). These two classes of effectors activated adenylate cyclase upon interaction with different receptor systems. No evidence for a mediatory role for PG in the action of catecholamines was found. PG interacted with 1321N1 cells with an order of potency of PGE1 = PGE2 greater than PGA1 greater than PGF2 alpha. The effect of combinations of the various PG indicated that all efficacious PG interacted with a common receptor. 7-Oxa-13-prostynoic acid and indomethacin were shown to be competitive inhibitors of the effect of PGE1 with Ki values of 4 and 150 micron, respectively. These two compounds did not inhibit the effect of isoproterenol. Polyphloretin phosphate caused a complex pattern of inhibition of the effects of PGE1 and at higher concentrations also inhibited the effects of isoproterenol. The mefenamate class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents was found to inhibit the effects of PGE1 with a potency order of meclofenamic acid greater than flufenamic acid = mefenamic acid. The inhibitory action of meclofenamic acid was complex involving specific, but partial, insurmountable antagonism of PGE1 as well as competitive inhibition of PGE1 effects. At higher concentrations of meclofenamic acid a nonspecific inhibition of the effects of both PGE1 and isoproterenol was observed. These studies suggest that the inhibition by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents of the physiological effects of PGE1 in animals may occur, at least in part, at the level of adenylate cyclase. The possibility that multiple classes of adenylate cyclase-linked PGE receptors might exist in nature is discussed."

No phosphorylation of S6 was observed under conditions of ethionine-induced inhibition of protein synthesis. Moderate phosphorylation, detected as the appearance of S6 and four or five phosphorylated derivatives, was observed in saline-treated animals. Reversal of ethionine-induced inhibition of protein synthesis by treatment with adenine led to extensive phosphorylation of S6. A model for protein synthesis which includes requisite phosphorylation of ribosomes during initiation is proposed.

https://openalex.org/W2049485606,"The conformation of prostaglandin F 2alpha (PGF 2alpha) has been determined by x-ray diffraction techniques. Two independent conformers of PGF 2alpha, studied as the tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine salt, are observed to adopt the familiar ""hairpin"" conformation with the alpha and omega chains aligned roughly parallel. The conformers differ in ring conformation and at the C(17)-C(18) bond, one adopting a C(9) envelope ring conformation and a trans geometry at the C(17)-C(18) bond, while the other adopts a C(8) envelope ring conformation and a novel gauche geometry about C(17)-C(18). Comparison of the conformation of PGF 2alpha with that of prostaglandin E2 suggests a recognition mechanism which would permit PGF 2alpha and prostaglandin E receptors to distinguish between the two potent prostaglandins. The recognition model explains much of the binding data for the PGF 2alpha receptor in the corpus luteum and predicts the existence of an interesting PGF 2alpha analog."

The Scatchard plots of specific binding showed that rat and human very low density lipoproteins interact with the high affinity sites on the hepatocytes with the apparent dissociation constants of 64 and 106 nM, respectively. These data also indicated that each hepatocyte was capable of binding 6 X 10(5) molecules of very low density lipoproteins."

Cell. Physiol. 91, 31-38). These results suggest a correlation between active cell multiplication and plasminogen activator secretion in both 3T3 and simian virus-transformed 3T3 cells. The data reported herein indicate that treatment of both subconfluent and confluent Swiss 3T3 cells with high concentrations of Ca2+ (final 3.0 to 4.9 mM) increases the amounts of both secreted and cell-associated plasminogen activator in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the ionophore A23187 (19 to 95 nM) in the presence of a normal level of Ca2+ (1.8 mM) stimulates both production and secretion of plasminogen activator from growing 3T3 cells.
