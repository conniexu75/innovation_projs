https://openalex.org/W2090935319,Three carbonaceous chondrites were examined for water-extractable amino acids. The Murchison and Murray specimens were found to be of similar amino acid composition. This similarity suggests that these amino acids are indigenous to type II carbonaceous chondrites. The Allende (type III) carbonaceous chondrite was found to be essentially devoid of amino acids on the basis of an identical analysis.

In two field sites in Colorado, tending ants protect caterpillars of G. lygdamus from attack by braconid and tachinid parasitoids. This protection may have been an important feature in the evolution of the association between lycaenid larvae and ants."

Data taken at latitude 42 degrees N on 17 days between 10 January and 18 February 1980 yield an average chlorine oxide column density of approximately 1.05 x 10(14) per square centimeter or approximately 2/3 that of the average of eight in situ balloon flight measurements (excluding the anomalously high data of 14 July 1977) made over the past 4 years at 32 degrees N. We find less chlorine oxide below 35 kilometers and a larger vertical gradient than predicted by theoretical models of the stratospheric ozone layer."
https://openalex.org/W2005310280,In anoxic marine sediments iron is extracted from clay minerals to form a sulfide. Magnesium from the surrounding solution then replaces the extracted iron in the clay mineral structure. This process removes magnesium from seawater and serves as a control on the composition of interstitial waters in sediments.

But the concepts which focused much of the early enthusiasm gave exaggerated promise of policy applications and provided an unproductive basis for research. The essential theoretical prerequisites for developing a system of social accounts-defining the variables and the interrelationships among them-are missing. It is now realized that evaluation research, particularly experimentation, must be relied on for evaluation of government programs. Through the development and analysis of descriptive time series and the modeling of social processes, we will be able to describe the state of the society and its dynamics and thus improve immensely our ability to state problems in a productive fashion, obtain clues as to promising lines of endeavor, and ask good questions. But these activities cannot measure program effectiveness. Finally, we must be skeptical about definitions of the social indicators enterprise which confine it to social engineering efforts. The issue is not whether social indicators are useful for policy but, rather, how this usefulness comes about. The interest in social indicators has stimulated a revival of interest in quantitative, comparative, social analysis (60), in the analysis of social change, in conceptual and measurement work on such topics as prejudice, crime, and learning, and in the development of models of social processes. The fruit of these efforts will be more directly a contribution to the policy-maker's cognition than to his decisions. Decision emerges from a mosaic of inputs, including valuational and political, as well as technical components. The work we have described deals with only one type of input; it is a contribution to the intellectual mapping process which is essential if decisionmakers are to know what it is that has changed, and how the change has come about. The character of the scientific contribution will, of course, vary with the subject. Models of a few social processes, such as those pertaining to social mobility and population dynamics, are in varying degrees of development and application. But for many other areas, the appropriate question is not ""How does it work?"" but ""How has it changed?"" And for still others, the question is ""What is it?"" The work of the Berkeley sociologists on the measurement of prejudice illustrates very well the interaction between measurement and conceptual development that is required to answer the question ""What is it?"" In the present state of work on this topic, the appropriate hypotheses are not so much concerned with the relationships of the phenomenon to others in a causal system, as they are with the nature of the phenomenon itself. What is being tested is a set of propositions that certain ways of thinking about social reality are productive, that a phenomenon as conceptualized is ""there"" in the reality being measured, and that the investigators have found a set of measures which tell us something we need to know about changes in the society. It is apparent that many different types of work go on under the rubric of social indicators. What is important is that the field be seen as an arena for long-term development, as an effort of social scientists to push forward developments in concepts and in methodology that promise payoffs to both science and public policy.Such a view is reflected in the funding commitments of the National Science Foundation, which supports many of the research projects reported above. What we may expect of this work was aptly stated by Duncan (61): The value of improved measures of social change ... is not that they necessarily resolve theoretical issues concerning social dynamics or settle pragmatic issues,of social policy, but that they may permit those issues to be argued more productively."

This is the first feeding record in the Satyrinae outside the monocotyledons and one of the few records of a butterfly feeding on other than a seed plant. Clues to possible evolutionary origins of this habit are found in the oviposition behavior of other Euptychia species."
https://openalex.org/W2077512897,"Assumptions made from studies of sparse living faunas of brachiopods, namely, that they are intolerant of mud, that the free-lying habit is confined to species without pedicles, and that the pedicle of articulate brachiopods is uniform in structure and function, do not withstand critical examination. Studies in New Zealand show that some species in the same area occur in both attached and free-lying populations. Individuals cannot always be differentiated morphologically, but the structure of populations from hard and soft substrates is distinctive. Attachment to a substrate appears to be a larval rather than an adult requirement in most species."

The results are surprising and suggest that the lower crust is highly conducting, having distinct lateral variations in conductivity beneath the Appalachian Mountains."

Results of inversion indicate a change of composition in the deepest 500 kilometers of the mantle. The assumption that the inner core is rigid is required to satisfy simultaneously the data on free oscillations and travel times.

Indeed it appears that aerosols cause heating of the atmosphere near the poles. The present background aerosol density at 85 degrees S latitude causes a temperature increase of approximately 0.2 degrees K, while that at 85 degrees N causes an increase of approximately 0.05 degrees K."

https://openalex.org/W2000685038,"Schöpf produced the first substantial report on the geology of North America, a work that has long suffered unjustified oblivion. In at least one feature this treatise is superior to that of Maclure (the""Father of American Geology"")- Schöpf attempted interpretation whereas Maclure did not. The suggestion is here offered that MacLure, who adopted Werner's classification of the stratigraphic succession, was simply shying away from Wernerian interpretation because he did not like the looks of it."
