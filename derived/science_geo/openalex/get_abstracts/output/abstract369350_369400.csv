https://openalex.org/W2120656656,"Screens for agents that specifically kill epithelial cancer stem cells (CSCs) have not been possible due to the rarity of these cells within tumor cell populations and their relative instability in culture. We describe here an approach to screening for agents with epithelial CSC-specific toxicity. We implemented this method in a chemical screen and discovered compounds showing selective toxicity for breast CSCs. One compound, salinomycin, reduces the proportion of CSCs by >100-fold relative to paclitaxel, a commonly used breast cancer chemotherapeutic drug. Treatment of mice with salinomycin inhibits mammary tumor growth in vivo and induces increased epithelial differentiation of tumor cells. In addition, global gene expression analyses show that salinomycin treatment results in the loss of expression of breast CSC genes previously identified by analyses of breast tissues isolated directly from patients. This study demonstrates the ability to identify agents with specific toxicity for epithelial CSCs."

https://openalex.org/W1973878786,"Genome-wide association studies suggest that common genetic variants explain only a modest fraction of heritable risk for common diseases, raising the question of whether rare variants account for a significant fraction of unexplained heritability. Although DNA sequencing costs have fallen markedly, they remain far from what is necessary for rare and novel variants to be routinely identified at a genome-wide scale in large cohorts. We have therefore sought to develop second-generation methods for targeted sequencing of all protein-coding regions ('exomes'), to reduce costs while enriching for discovery of highly penetrant variants. Here we report on the targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing of the exomes of 12 humans. These include eight HapMap individuals representing three populations, and four unrelated individuals with a rare dominantly inherited disorder, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS). We demonstrate the sensitive and specific identification of rare and common variants in over 300 megabases of coding sequence. Using FSS as a proof-of-concept, we show that candidate genes for Mendelian disorders can be identified by exome sequencing of a small number of unrelated, affected individuals. This strategy may be extendable to diseases with more complex genetics through larger sample sizes and appropriate weighting of non-synonymous variants by predicted functional impact."
https://openalex.org/W2056176185,"Using the Affymetrix 500K Mapping array and publicly available genotypes, we identified 18 SNPs whose allele frequency differed significantly(P < 1 x 10(-5)) between pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases (n = 317) and non-ALL controls (n = 17,958). Two SNPs in ARID5B not only differed between ALL and non-ALL groups (rs10821936, P = 1.4 x 10(-15), odds ratio (OR) = 1.91; rs10994982, P = 5.7 x 10(-9), OR = 1.62) but also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from other subtypes (rs10821936, P = 1.62 x 10(-5), OR = 2.17; rs10994982, P = 0.003, OR 1.72). These ARID5B SNPs also distinguished B-hyperdiploid ALL from other subtypes in an independent validation cohort (n = 124 children with ALL; P = 0.003 and P = 0.0008, OR 2.45 and 2.86, respectively) and were associated with methotrexate accumulation and gene expression pattern in leukemic lymphoblasts. We conclude that germline variants affect susceptibility to, and characteristics of, specific ALL subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W1998823290,"To identify risk variants for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we conducted a genome-wide association study of two case-control series, analyzing the genotypes with respect to 291,423 tagging SNPs in a total of 907 ALL cases and 2,398 controls. We identified risk loci for ALL at 7p12.2 (IKZF1, rs4132601, odds ratio (OR) = 1.69, P = 1.20 x 10(-19)), 10q21.2 (ARID5B, rs7089424, OR = 1.65, P = 6.69 x 10(-19)) and 14q11.2 (CEBPE, rs2239633, OR = 1.34, P = 2.88 x 10(-7)). The 10q21.2 (ARID5B) risk association appears to be selective for the subset of B-cell precursor ALL with hyperdiploidy. These data show that common low-penetrance susceptibility alleles contribute to the risk of developing childhood ALL and provide new insight into disease causation of this specific hematological cancer. Notably, all three risk variants map to genes involved in transcriptional regulation and differentiation of B-cell progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2118518474,"Marco Tartaglia and colleagues report the identification of mutations of SHOC2 in individuals with Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair. The mutations cause aberrantly acquired N-myristoylation of SHOC2 resulting in aberrant targeting of SHOC2 to the plasma membrane. SHOC2 is believed to function as a scaffold linking RAS to downstream signal transducers. N-myristoylation is a common form of co-translational protein fatty acylation resulting from the attachment of myristate to a required N-terminal glycine residue1,2. We show that aberrantly acquired N-myristoylation of SHOC2, a leucine-rich repeat–containing protein that positively modulates RAS-MAPK signal flow3,4,5,6, underlies a clinically distinctive condition of the neuro-cardio-facial-cutaneous disorders family. Twenty-five subjects with a relatively consistent phenotype previously termed Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (MIM607721)7 shared the 4A>G missense change in SHOC2 (producing an S2G amino acid substitution) that introduces an N-myristoylation site, resulting in aberrant targeting of SHOC2 to the plasma membrane and impaired translocation to the nucleus upon growth factor stimulation. Expression of SHOC2S2G in vitro enhanced MAPK activation in a cell type–specific fashion. Induction of SHOC2S2G in Caenorhabditis elegans engendered protruding vulva, a neomorphic phenotype previously associated with aberrant signaling. These results document the first example of an acquired N-terminal lipid modification of a protein causing human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2054146939,"Studies on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) action typically assess gene responses by long-term stimulation with synthetic hormones. As corticosteroids are released from adrenal glands in a circadian and high-frequency (ultradian) mode, such treatments may not provide an accurate assessment of physiological hormone action. Here we demonstrate that ultradian hormone stimulation induces cyclic GR-mediated transcriptional regulation, or gene pulsing, both in cultured cells and in animal models. Equilibrium receptor-occupancy of regulatory elements precisely tracks the ligand pulses. Nascent RNA transcripts from GR-regulated genes are released in distinct quanta, demonstrating a profound difference between the transcriptional programs induced by ultradian and constant stimulation. Gene pulsing is driven by rapid GR exchange with response elements and by GR recycling through the chaperone machinery, which promotes GR activation and reactivation in response to the ultradian hormone release, thus coupling promoter activity to the naturally occurring fluctuations in hormone levels. The GR signalling pathway has been optimized for a prompt and timely response to fluctuations in hormone levels, indicating that biologically accurate regulation of gene targets by GR requires an ultradian mode of hormone stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2071097995,"Small RNAs direct RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) to regulate stability and translation of mRNAs. RISCs associated with target mRNAs often accumulate in discrete cytoplasmic foci known as GW-bodies. However, RISC proteins can associate with membrane compartments such as the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we show that GW-bodies are associated with late endosomes (multivesicular bodies, MVBs). Blocking the maturation of MVBs into lysosomes by loss of the tethering factor HPS4 (ref. 5) enhances short interfering RNA (siRNA)- and micro RNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing in Drosophila melanogaster and humans. It also triggers over-accumulation of GW-bodies. Blocking MVB formation by ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) depletion results in impaired miRNA silencing and loss of GW-bodies. These results indicate that active RISCs are physically and functionally coupled to MVBs. We further show that MVBs promote the competence of RISCs in loading small RNAs. We suggest that the recycling of RISCs is promoted by MVBs, resulting in RISCs more effectively engaging with small RNA effectors and possibly target RNAs. It may provide a means to enhance the dynamics of RNA silencing in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2139144040,"Gene-specific changes in DNA methylation are promising biomarkers, but sensitive quantitative detection of these epigenetic marks remains challenging. Li et al. adapt the so-called BEAMing technology to enable high-throughput digital quantification of gene methylation in clinical samples. Analysis of abnormally methylated genes is increasingly important in basic research and in the development of cancer biomarkers1,2. We have developed methyl-BEAMing technology to enable absolute quantification of the number of methylated molecules in a sample. Individual DNA fragments are amplified and analyzed either by flow cytometry3 or next-generation sequencing. We demonstrate enumeration of as few as one methylated molecule in ∼5,000 unmethylated molecules in DNA from plasma or fecal samples. Using methylated vimentin as a biomarker in plasma samples, methyl-BEAMing detected 59% of cancer cases. In early-stage colorectal cancers, this sensitivity was four times more than that obtained by assaying serum-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). With stool samples, methyl-BEAMing detected 41% of cancers and 45% of advanced adenomas. In addition to diagnostic and prognostic applications, this digital quantification of rare methylation events should be applicable to preclinical assessment of new epigenetic biomarkers and quantitative analyses in epigenetic research."
https://openalex.org/W1991190713,"Mutations in PINK1 and PARK2 cause autosomal recessive parkinsonism, a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. To discover potential therapeutic pathways, we identified factors that genetically interact with Drosophila park and Pink1. We found that overexpression of the translation inhibitor Thor (4E-BP) can suppress all of the pathologic phenotypes, including degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila. 4E-BP is activated in vivo by the TOR inhibitor rapamycin, which could potently suppress pathology in Pink1 and park mutants. Rapamycin also ameliorated mitochondrial defects in cells from individuals with PARK2 mutations. Recently, 4E-BP was shown to be inhibited by the most common cause of parkinsonism, dominant mutations in LRRK2. We also found that loss of the Drosophila LRRK2 homolog activated 4E-BP and was also able to suppress Pink1 and park pathology. Thus, in conjunction with recent findings, our results suggest that pharmacologic stimulation of 4E-BP activity may represent a viable therapeutic approach for multiple forms of parkinsonism."
https://openalex.org/W1996275566,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a ubiquitously expressed receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the etiology of several human cancers. Cetuximab is an EGFR-blocking antibody that has been approved for the treatment of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and metastatic colorectal cancer. Previous reports have shown that EGFR translocation to the nucleus is associated with cell proliferation. Here we investigated mechanisms of acquired resistance to cetuximab using a model derived from the non-small cell lung cancer line H226. We demonstrated that cetuximab-resistant cells overexpress HER family ligands including epidermal growth factor (EGF), amphiregulin, heparin-binding EGF and β-cellulin. Overexpression of these ligands is associated with the nuclear translocation of the EGFR and this process was mediated by the Src family kinases (SFK). Treatment of cetuximab-resistant cells with the SFK inhibitor, dasatinib, resulted in loss of nuclear EGFR, increased membrane expression of the EGFR and resensitization to cetuximab. In addition, expression of a nuclear localization sequence-tagged EGFR in cetuximab-sensitive cells increased resistance to cetuximab both in vitro and in mouse xenografts. Collectively, these data suggest that nuclear expression of EGFR may be an important molecular determinant of resistance to cetuximab therapy and provides a rationale for investigating nuclear EGFR as a biomarker for cetuximab response. Further, these data suggest a rationale for the design of clinical trials that examine the value of treating patients with cetuximab-resistant tumors with inhibitors of SFKs in combination with cetuximab."

https://openalex.org/W1964496783,"Predicting the impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) on target proteins is challenging because of their different regulatory effects at the transcriptional and translational levels. In this study, we applied a novel protein lysate microarray (LMA) technology to systematically monitor for target protein levels after high-throughput transfections of 319 pre-miRs into breast cancer cells. We identified 21 miRNAs that downregulated the estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha), as validated by western blotting and quantitative real time-PCR, and by demonstrating the inhibition of estrogen-stimulated cell growth. Five potent ERalpha-regulating miRNAs, miR-18a, miR-18b, miR-193b, miR-206 and miR-302c, were confirmed to directly target ERalpha in 3'-untranslated region reporter assays. The gene expression signature that they repressed highly overlapped with that of a small interfering RNA against ERalpha, and across all the signatures tested, was most closely associated with the repression of known estrogen-induced genes. Furthermore, miR-18a and miR-18b showed higher levels of expression in ERalpha-negative as compared with ERalpha-positive clinical tumors. In summary, we present systematic and direct functional evidence of miRNAs inhibiting ERalpha signaling in breast cancer, and demonstrate the high-throughput LMA technology as a novel, powerful technique in determining the relative impact of various miRNAs on key target proteins and associated cellular processes and pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2296573431,"In functional magnetic resonance imaging, the brain's response to experimental manipulation is almost always assumed to be independent of endogenous oscillations. To test this, we addressed the possible interaction between cognitive task performance and endogenous fMRI oscillations in an experiment designed to answer two questions: 1) Does performance of a cognitively effortful task significantly change fractal scaling properties of fMRI time series compared to their values before task performance? 2) If so, can we relate the extent of task-related perturbation to the difficulty of the task?Using a novel continuous acquisition ""rest-task-rest"" design, we found that endogenous dynamics tended to recover their pre-task parameter values relatively slowly, over the course of several minutes, following completion of one of two versions of the n-back working memory task and that the rate of recovery was slower following completion of the more demanding (n = 2) version of the task.This result supports the model that endogenous low frequency oscillatory dynamics are relevant to the brain's response to exogenous stimulation. Moreover, it suggests that large-scale neurocognitive systems measured using fMRI, like the heart and other physiological systems subjected to external demands for enhanced performance, can take a considerable period of time to return to a stable baseline state."
https://openalex.org/W2059361662,"Deoxyribozymes (DNA catalysts) have been reported for cleavage of RNA phosphodiester linkages, but cleaving peptide or DNA phosphodiester linkages is much more challenging. Using in vitro selection, here we identified deoxyribozymes that sequence-specifically hydrolyze DNA with multiple turnover and with a rate enhancement of 108 (possibly as high as 1014). The new DNA catalysts require both Mn2+ and Zn2+, which is noteworthy because many natural DNA nucleases are bimetallic protein enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2035373814,"In the Drosophila antennal lobe, there are several projection neurons (PNs) that are postsynaptic to each glomerulus. Here, the authors report that activity in these 'sister' PNs is correlated at a fine temporal scale. The predominant source of correlated activity is shared input from olfactory receptor neurons, with a smaller contribution from reciprocal PN-PN connections. Multineuronal recordings often reveal synchronized spikes in different neurons. The manner in which correlated spike timing affects neural codes depends on the statistics of correlations, which in turn reflects the connectivity that gives rise to correlations. However, determining the connectivity of neurons recorded in vivo can be difficult. We investigated the origins of correlated activity in genetically labeled neurons of the Drosophila antennal lobe. Dual recordings showed synchronized spontaneous spikes in projection neurons (PNs) postsynaptic to the same type of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN). Odors increased these correlations. The primary origin of correlations lies in the divergence of each ORN onto every PN in its glomerulus. Reciprocal PN–PN connections make a smaller contribution to correlations and PN spike trains in different glomeruli were only weakly correlated. PN axons from the same glomerulus reconverge in the lateral horn, where pooling redundant signals may allow lateral horn neurons to average out noise that arises independently in these PNs."

https://openalex.org/W2060082601,"Background The genetic basis of host specificity for animal and plant pathogenic bacteria remains poorly understood. For plant pathogenic bacteria, host range is restricted to one or a few host plant species reflecting a tight adaptation to specific hosts. Methodology/Principal Findings Two hypotheses can be formulated to explain host specificity: either it can be explained by the phylogenetic position of the strains, or by the association of virulence genes enabling a pathological convergence of phylogenically distant strains. In this latter hypothesis, host specificity would result from the interaction between repertoires of bacterial virulence genes and repertoires of genes involved in host defences. To challenge these two hypotheses, we selected 132 Xanthomonas axonopodis strains representative of 18 different pathovars which display different host range. First, the phylogenetic position of each strain was determined by sequencing the housekeeping gene rpoD. This study showed that many pathovars of Xanthomonas axonopodis are polyphyletic. Second, we investigated the distribution of 35 type III effector genes (T3Es) in these strains by both PCR and hybridization methods. Indeed, for pathogenic bacteria T3Es were shown to trigger and to subvert host defences. Our study revealed that T3E repertoires comprise core and variable gene suites that likely have distinct roles in pathogenicity and different evolutionary histories. Our results showed a correspondence between composition of T3E repertoires and pathovars of Xanthomonas axonopodis. For polyphyletic pathovars, this suggests that T3E genes might explain a pathological convergence of phylogenetically distant strains. We also identified several DNA rearrangements within T3E genes, some of which correlate with host specificity of strains. Conclusions/Significance These data provide insight into the potential role played by T3E genes for pathogenic bacteria and support a “repertoire for repertoire” hypothesis that may explain host specificity. Our work provides resources for functional and evolutionary studies aiming at understanding host specificity of pathogenic bacteria, functional redundancy between T3Es and the driving forces shaping T3E repertoires."
https://openalex.org/W2090466701,"SIRT1, an NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)-dependent deacetylase, protects cells from stress-induced apoptosis, and its orthologues delay aging in lower eukaryotes. SIRT1 increases survival in response to stress such as DNA damage by deacetylating a number of substrates including pro-apoptotic protein p53. The molecular mechanism by which DNA-damage activates SIRT1 is not known. By screening a kinase inhibitor library, we identified CK2 as a SIRT1 kinase. CK2 is a pleiotropic kinase with more than 300 substrates and well-known anti-apoptotic and pro-growth activities. We find that CK2 is recruited to SIRT1 after ionizing radiation (IR) and phosphorylates conserved residues Ser 154, 649, 651 and 683 in the N- and C-terminal domains of mouse SIRT1. Phosphorylation of SIRT1 increases its deacetylation rate but not if the four Ser residues are mutated. In addition, phosphorylation of SIRT1 increases its substrate-binding affinity. CK2-mediated phosphorylation increases the ability of SIRT1 to deacetylate p53 and protect cells from apoptosis after DNA damage. Based on these findings, we propose that CK2 protects against IR-induced apoptosis partly by phosphorylating and activating SIRT1. Thus, this work suggests that SIRT1 is a component of the expansive anti-apoptotic network controlled by CK2. Since expression of both CK2 and SIRT1 is upregulated with tumorigenesis and downregulated with senescence, the CK2-SIRT1 link sheds new light on how CK2 may regulate cancer development and aging."
https://openalex.org/W2002499141,"Ruminococcus flavefaciens is a predominant cellulolytic rumen bacterium, which forms a multi-enzyme cellulosome complex that could play an integral role in the ability of this bacterium to degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides. Identifying the major enzyme types involved in plant cell wall degradation is essential for gaining a better understanding of the cellulolytic capabilities of this organism as well as highlighting potential enzymes for application in improvement of livestock nutrition and for conversion of cellulosic biomass to liquid fuels.The R. flavefaciens FD-1 genome was sequenced to 29x-coverage, based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis estimates (4.4 Mb), and assembled into 119 contigs providing 4,576,399 bp of unique sequence. As much as 87.1% of the genome encodes ORFs, tRNA, rRNAs, or repeats. The GC content was calculated at 45%. A total of 4,339 ORFs was detected with an average gene length of 918 bp. The cellulosome model for R. flavefaciens was further refined by sequence analysis, with at least 225 dockerin-containing ORFs, including previously characterized cohesin-containing scaffoldin molecules. These dockerin-containing ORFs encode a variety of catalytic modules including glycoside hydrolases (GHs), polysaccharide lyases, and carbohydrate esterases. Additionally, 56 ORFs encode proteins that contain carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). Functional microarray analysis of the genome revealed that 56 of the cellulosome-associated ORFs were up-regulated, 14 were down-regulated, 135 were unaffected, when R. flavefaciens FD-1 was grown on cellulose versus cellobiose. Three multi-modular xylanases (ORF01222, ORF03896, and ORF01315) exhibited the highest levels of up-regulation.The genomic evidence indicates that R. flavefaciens FD-1 has the largest known number of fiber-degrading enzymes likely to be arranged in a cellulosome architecture. Functional analysis of the genome has revealed that the growth substrate drives expression of enzymes predicted to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism as well as expression and assembly of key cellulosomal enzyme components."
https://openalex.org/W2124957231,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant glioma type with diffuse borders due to extensive tumor cell infiltration. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of GBM cell dispersal is critical for developing effective therapies to limit infiltration. We identified neuropilin-1 as a mediator of cancer cell invasion by a functional proteomic screen and showed its role in GBM cells. Neuropilin-1 is a receptor for semaphorin3A (Sema3A), a secreted chemorepellent that facilitates axon guidance during neural development. Although neuropilin-1 expression in GBMs was previously shown, its role as a Sema3A receptor remained elusive. Using fluorophore-assisted light inactivation and RNA interference , we showed that neuropilin-1 is required for GBM cell migration. We also showed that GBM cells secrete Sema3A endogenously, and RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Sema3A inhibits migration and alters cell morphology that is dependent on Rac1 activity. Sema3A depletion also reduces dispersal, which is recovered by supplying Sema3A exogenously. Extracellular application of Sema3A decreases cell-substrate adhesion in a neuropilin-1-dependent manner. Using immunohistochemistry, we showed that Sema3A is overexpressed in a subset of human GBMs compared with the non-neoplastic brain. Together, these findings implicate Sema3A as an autocrine signal for neuropilin-1 to promote GBM dispersal by modulating substrate adhesion and suggest that targeting Sema3A-neuropilin-1 signaling may limit GBM infiltration."

We designed training conditions that did not elicit instructive signals in the climbing fibers, but nevertheless induced robust and consistent motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex of rhesus monkeys. Our results indicate that instructive signals in the climbing fibers are not necessary for cerebellum-dependent learning. Instead, instructive signals carried by either the climbing fibers or Purkinje cell simple spikes may be sufficient to induce motor learning, with additive effects occurring when both instructive signals are present during training."
https://openalex.org/W2089207295,"Interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are absolute blocks to transcription and replication and can provoke genomic instability and cell death. Studies in bacteria define a two-stage repair scheme, the first involving recognition and incision on either side of the cross-link on one strand (unhooking), followed by recombinational repair or lesion bypass synthesis. The resultant monoadduct is removed in a second stage by nucleotide excision repair. In mammalian cells, there are multiple, but poorly defined, pathways, with much current attention on repair in S phase. However, many questions remain, including the efficiency of repair in the absence of replication, the factors involved in cross-link recognition, and the timing and demarcation of the first and second repair cycles. We have followed the repair of laser-localized lesions formed by psoralen (cross-links/monoadducts) and angelicin (only monoadducts) in mammalian cells. Both were repaired in G(1) phase by nucleotide excision repair-dependent pathways. Removal of psoralen adducts was blocked in XPC-deficient cells but occurred with wild type kinetics in cells deficient in DDB2 protein (XPE). XPC protein was rapidly recruited to psoralen adducts. However, accumulation of DDB2 was slow and XPC-dependent. Inhibition of repair DNA synthesis did not interfere with DDB2 recruitment to angelicin but eliminated recruitment to psoralen. Our results demonstrate an efficient ICL repair pathway in G(1) phase cells dependent on XPC, with entry of DDB2 only after repair synthesis that completes the first repair cycle. DDB2 accumulation at sites of cross-link repair is a marker for the start of the second repair cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2062357159,"GATA-2, a member of the GATA family of transcription factors, is involved in androgen receptor (AR) signaling, however, little is known regarding its role in prostate cancer. Here, we report that GATA-2 is expressed in a substantial proportion of prostate cancers and that high expression of GATA-2 is associated with biochemical recurrence and distant metastatic progression in a validation set of 203 cancers. In vitro data show that GATA-2 is directly recruited to the promoter region of the AR upon androgen stimulation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells with 5α-dihydroxytestosterone (DHT) for 24 h. Ectopic GATA-2 expression causes the induction of AR transcript levels under androgen-depleted conditions (P<0.05). The expression of the AR target gene, AZGP1, is induced upon androgen stimulation and this effect is repressed by GATA-2. In contrast, GATA-2 significantly increases transcript levels of KLK2, which increases further in a time-dependent manner on DHT treatment and in the presence of GATA-2. These results indicate that upregulation of GATA-2 may contribute to the progression to aggressive prostate cancer through modulation of expression of AR and key androgen-regulated genes, one of which, AZGP1, is associated with the progression to metastatic disease."

Two endosomal DUBs, AMSH (associated molecule with the Src homology 3 domain of STAM (signal-transducing adapter molecule)) and UBPY (ubiquitin-specific protease Y) (also known as USP8), regulate deubiquitination and postendocytic trafficking of EGFR (4Clague M.J. Urbé S. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 551-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). AMSH belongs to the JAMM (JAB1/MPN/Mov34) family of metalloproteases and shows specificity for Lys63- over Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains (5McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 6McCullough J. Row P.E. Lorenzo O. Doherty M. Beynon R. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 160-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). UBPY is a cysteine protease of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family and does not discriminate between Lys48- and Lys63-linked ubiquitin (7Naviglio S. Mattecucci C. Matoskova B. Nagase T.

Ubiquitinated EGFR then interacts with the Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate)-STAM complex in early endosomes (10Urbé S. Sachse M. Row P.E. Preisinger C. Barr F.A. Strous G. Klumperman J. Clague M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4169-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Hrs-STAM forms part of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-I, -II, -III complex that sorts ubiquitinated receptors in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to intralumenal vesicles that eventually fuse with lysosomes, where degradation occurs (11Williams R.L. Urbé S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Before receptors are incorporated into the intralumenal vesicles, they are deubiquitinated, which serves to maintain levels of free ubiquitin (11Williams R.L. Urbé S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). AMSH and UBPY interact directly with STAM through a common binding site within its Src homology 3 domain (12Asao H. Sasaki Y.

The balance of EGFR ubiquitination by c-Cbl and deubiquitination by AMSH and UBPY controls the postendocytic trafficking and down-regulation of the EGFR. c-Cbl promotes lysosomal degradation of the EGFR (9Levkowitz G.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), AMSH opposes c-Cbl action and promotes EGFR recycling (5McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J.

The role of AMSH and UBPY in regulating deubiquitination, trafficking, and signaling of GPCRs in endosomes is largely unknown. A recent study has shown, however, that AMSH and UBPY regulate the down-regulation of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), a GPCR that is ubiquitinated and degraded following activation (18Hislop J.N. Henry A.G. Marchese A. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19361-19370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression of catalytically inactive mutants of AMSH or UBPY or knockdown of AMSH or UBPY levels using siRNA inhibits down-regulation of DOR. Interestingly, the roles of AMSH and UBPY in DOR down-regulation appear to be nonredundant, since depletion of either DUB produced comparable effects, and simultaneous depletion of both DUBs did not have additional consequences (18Hislop J.N. Henry A.G. Marchese A. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19361-19370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Different DUBs, USP20 and -33, have been recently shown to reverse agonist-induced ubiquitination of the β2AR (19Berthouze M. Venkataramanan V. Li Y. Shenoy S.K. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1684-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).We examined the roles of AMSH and UBPY in the ubiquitination, postendocytic trafficking, and lysosomal degradation of PAR2. We also determined whether AMSH and UBPY regulate PAR2 association with β-arrestins in endosomes and control β-arrestin-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. PAR2 is a receptor for multiple serine proteases that are generated during injury and inflammation (20Ossovskaya V.S. Bunnett N.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 579-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Activated PAR2 promotes inflammation and pain, and PAR2 contributes to inflammatory diseases of the airway, joints, and intestine. PAR2 levels are elevated during inflammation, due to increased mRNA expression or perhaps decreased receptor degradation, which amplifies the proinflammatory actions of proteases (21Nystedt S. Ramakrishnan V. Sundelin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14910-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Given the irreversible nature of proteolytic activation, and since the internalized receptor probably signals by the β-arrestin-dependent recruitment of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to endosomes (22DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Déry O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), termination of PAR2 signaling requires receptor degradation in lysosomes, which in turn is ubiquitination-dependent (3Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Böhm S.K. Khitin L.M.

It is therefore important to understand mechanisms of PAR2 ubiquitination and lysosomal targeting and also how these processes can be reversed. We have reported that activated PAR2 is monoubiquitinated at multiple sites by the E3 ligase c-Cbl and targeted to lysosomes by an Hrs-dependent pathway (3Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Hasdemir B. Bunnett N.W. Cottrell G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29646-29657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nothing is known about the mechanism and function of PAR2 deubiquitination. Herein, we examined the role of AMSH and UBPY in regulating the deubiquitination, lysosomal trafficking, and degradation of PAR2, the interaction of PAR2 with β-arrestin2, and β-arrestin-mediated ERK2 activation. We demonstrate that endosomal DUBs are key regulators of GPCR down-regulation.DISCUSSIONUbiquitination of certain GPCRs is a targeting signal for postendocytic sorting to lysosomes (Fig. 11). Since ubiquitination is highly dynamic, a clear understanding of ubiquitin-dependent GPCR trafficking requires knowledge of the role of DUBs, which act downstream in ubiquitination pathways and have the potential to determine the ultimate fate of receptors. Here we identified two endosomal DUBs, AMSH and UBPY, as key regulators of PAR2 ubiquitination and down-regulation.By disrupting various stages of the endocytic pathway, we determined the subcellular sites of PAR2 ubiquitination and deubiquitination (Fig. 11). PAR2 ubiquitination was unaffected by disruption of endocytosis with hypertonic sucrose or trapping PAR2 in early endosomes by overexpression of Hrs (24Hasdemir B. Bunnett N.W. Cottrell G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29646-29657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, PAR2 is ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane and in early endosomes, which is consistent with colocalization of PAR2 and c-Cbl (3Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PAR2 is subsequently deubiquitinated between early endosomes and lysosomes, since the receptor was deubiquitinated when it reached lysosomes in the presence of lysosomal inhibitors. Our observations are supported by previous studies showing that ubiquitin molecules need to be released from receptors prior to their delivery to lysosomes for degradation in order to maintain levels of free ubiquitin (11Williams R.L. Urbé S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Thus, although PAR2 is ultimately in a deubiquitinated state when it reaches lysosomes, it does require ubiquitination at the earlier stages of the pathway for correct lysosomal sorting (3Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination has a quite different regulatory effect on another member of the PAR family, PAR1, where ubiquitination retains the receptor at the cell surface and is not required for agonist-induced lysosomal sorting and degradation (38Wolfe B.L. Marchese A. Trejo J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).AMSH and UBPY are strong candidates for deubiquitinating PAR2. Activated PAR2 prominently colocalized with AMSH in endosomes, and expression of catalytically inactive AMSH or UBPY enhanced colocalization of PAR2 and DUBs in early endosomes. EGF causes similar trafficking of EGFR to endosomes containing AMSH or UBPY in HeLa cells (5McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). AMSH and UBPY have a common binding site within the Src homology 3 domain of STAM, which constitutively interacts with Hrs through coiled-coil regions (12Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T. Endo Y. Fujita T. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32785-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Tanaka N. Kaneko K. Asao H. Kasai H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37481-37487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It remains to be resolved whether the association of PAR2 with AMSH and UBPY in endosomes is a result of a direct interaction or an indirect interaction via the Hrs-STAM complex, since PAR2 engages with Hrs in early endosomes (24Hasdemir B. Bunnett N.W. Cottrell G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29646-29657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The UBPY-EGFR interaction is also mediated by the Hrs-STAM complex (39Mizuno E. Iura T. Mukai A. Yoshimori T. Kitamura N. Komada M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5163-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Overexpression of wild-type AMSH or UBPY did not affect PAR2 ubiquitination, trafficking, or degradation, suggesting that adequate levels of endogenous AMSH and UBPY are already present in HEK cells. This is consistent with reports that the overexpression of AMSH and UBPY does not affect EGFR ubiquitination (40Alwan H.A. van Leeuwen J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1658-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), although overexpression of UBPY has also been shown to reduce EGFR ubiquitination (39Mizuno E. Iura T. Mukai A. Yoshimori T. Kitamura N. Komada M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5163-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of catalytically inactive AMSH or UBPY markedly increased base-line levels of PAR2 ubiquitination and, in agonist-stimulated cells, caused retention of ubiquitinated PAR2 in enlarged early endosomes, with which AMSH(D348A) and UBPY(C786S) are constitutively associated, suggesting that their catalytic activity is necessary for dissociation from endosomal membranes. AMSH(D348A) and UBPY(C786S) cause endosomal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, including cargo, such as EGFR or PAR2, and components of the endosomal sorting machinery, such as STAM (5McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 40Alwan H.A. van Leeuwen J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1658-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the accumulation of ubiquitinated STAM is promoted by AMSH(D348A) but not UBPY(C786S). AMSH(D348A) or UBPY(C786S) also inhibited lysosomal trafficking and degradation of PAR2, which could be explained by diminished deubiquitination of PAR2 in endosomes and reduced receptor incorporation into intralumenal vesicles of MVBs. Overall, our results suggest that the catalytic activity of AMSH and UBPY is required for PAR2 deubiquitination and subsequent lysosomal trafficking and degradation.Since catalytically inactive DUBs are constitutively associated with endosomal membranes, they may displace either endogenous AMSH or UBPY. To further evaluate the role of endogenous AMSH or UBPY in PAR2 regulation, we used specific siRNAs. Knockdown of AMSH or UBPY inhibited PAR2 deubiquitination and degradation, which could be explained in several ways. First, by suppressing PAR2 deubiquitination, AMSH or UBPY depletion may interfere with the incorporation of the receptor into intralumenal vesicles of MVBs, thereby disrupting lysosomal delivery and degradation, as reported for the EGFR after UBPY knockdown (8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Impaired deubiquitination could cause endosomal accumulation of ubiquitinated PAR2 or EGFR, which may overwhelm the sorting machinery and disrupt receptor sorting. Second, DUB knockdown may suppress PAR2 trafficking from endosomes to lysosomes due to changes in endosomal morphology. UBPY knockdown caused PAR2 retention in abnormally enlarged early endosomes. UBPY knockdown results in aberrantly enlarged early endosomes by increasing the number and size of multivesicular endosomal structures (8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 5029-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). UBPY knockdown inhibits lysosomal trafficking and degradation of the EGFR, which is directly due to loss of UBPY, since overexpression of siRNA-resistant UBPY rescues this phenotype (8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Bowers K. Piper S.C. Edeling M.A. Gray S.R.

The inhibitory effect of AMSH knockdown on PAR2 degradation is unlikely to be due to changes in endosomal morphology, since endosomes had normal morphology. Third, AMSH or UBPY knockdown may influence the ubiquitination of key endosomal sorting proteins, such as Hrs and STAM. Thus, the effects on PAR2 could be due to changes in the stability of sorting proteins in endosomes. UBPY knockdown depletes STAM, suggesting that UBPY is necessary to reverse STAM ubiquitination, which targets STAM for proteasomal degradation (8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 17Niendorf S. Oksche A. Kisser A. Löhler J. Prinz M. Schorle H. Feller S. Lewitzky M. Horak I. Knobeloch K.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 5029-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although STAM directly stimulates AMSH activity in vitro (6McCullough J. Row P.E. Lorenzo O. Doherty M. Beynon R. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 160-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), overexpression of STAM in UBPY knockdown cells cannot rescue the observed defect in EGFR degradation (8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Unlike UBPY knockdown, AMSH knockdown does not affect the stability of components of the endosomal sorting machinery, such as STAM (5McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of AMSH knockdown on PAR2 degradation is unlikely to be due to changes in the stability of the endosomal sorting machinery. However, AMSH is diminished by UBPY knockdown (5McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), which could partially explain the effects of UBPY depletion on PAR2. Finally, AMSH or UBPY knockdown may reduce levels of free ubiquitin and consequently affect the efficient ubiquitination and lysosomal sorting of PAR2. Depletion of the yeast protein Doa4, which is homologous to mammalian UBPY, reduces free ubiquitin levels and impairs ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis and vacuolar degradation of the yeast GPCR Ste3 (41Chen L. Davis N.G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 110-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Doa4 activity at the prevacuolar compartment is required to recover ubiquitin from ubiquitinated receptors en route to the vacuole (the yeast lysosome) (42Amerik A.Y. Nowak J. Swaminathan S. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3365-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, UBPY knockdown in mammalian cells does not deplete levels of free ubiquitin (8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 17Niendorf S. Oksche A. Kisser A. Löhler J.

Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 5029-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), suggesting that defects in the maintenance of free ubiquitin levels are unlikely to account for reduced lysosomal degradation of PAR2 after UBPY knockdown. We propose that AMSH or UBPY knockdown directly suppresses PAR2 deubiquitination and thereby impairs incorporation of the receptor into intralumenal vesicles of MVBs and delivery to lysosomes for degradation.Our results support the conclusion that both AMSH and UBPY deubiquitinate PAR2 and thereby promote lysosomal targeting and degradation of the receptor (Fig. 11). Since disruption of either AMSH or UBPY function produced similar effects, these DUBs appear to have non-redundant roles in PAR2 trafficking to lysosomes. PAR2 deubiquitination probably occurs downstream of Hrs and after the lysosomal sorting decision has been made. A different model has been proposed for the EGFR, where AMSH and UBPY may act in opposition (43Urbé S. McCullough J. Row P. Prior I.A. Welchman R. Clague M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). UBPY knockdown suppresses EGFR degradation (8Row P.E. Prior I.A. McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12618-12624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Bowers K. Piper S.C. Edeling M.A. Gray S.R. Owen D.J. Lehner P.J. Luzio J.P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), suggesting that UBPY promotes and AMSH impedes EGFR degradation. AMSH may thus act at an early stage of the sorting process to reverse EGFR ubiquitination prior to commitment to the lysosomal pathway and may thereby divert the receptor to a recycling route (5McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 43Urbé S. McCullough J. Row P. Prior I.A. Welchman R. Clague M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 754-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). If AMSH deubiquitinated PAR2 at an earlier stage, it could interfere with lysosomal sorting and thereby prevent PAR2 degradation, which does not appear to be the case. However, PAR2 that has been deubiquitinated by AMSH at an early stage could be ubiquitinated again by c-Cbl and deubiquitinated by UBPY prior to sequestration into intralumenal vesicles. Thus, the cycle of ubiquitination and deubiquitination may determine the rate at which degradation occurs. AMSH or UBPY may also deubiquitinate other proteins that regulate PAR2 trafficking to lysosomes. β-Arrestins mediate desensitization of GPCRs, couple GPCRs to clathrin and AP2 to mediate endocytosis, and act as scaffolds for recruitment of MAPK cascade components (22DeFea K.A.

https://openalex.org/W2097240211,"Individual behavioral performance during learning is known to be affected by modulatory factors, such as stress and motivation, and by genetic predispositions that influence sensitivity to these factors. Despite numerous studies, no integrative framework is available that could predict how a given animal would perform a certain learning task in a realistic situation. We found that a simple reinforcement learning model can predict mouse behavior in a hole-box conditioning task if model metaparameters are dynamically controlled on the basis of the mouse's genotype and phenotype, stress conditions, recent performance feedback and pharmacological manipulations of adrenergic alpha-2 receptors. We find that stress and motivation affect behavioral performance by altering the exploration-exploitation balance in a genotype-dependent manner. Our results also provide computational insights into how an inverted U-shape relation between stress/arousal/norepinephrine levels and behavioral performance could be explained through changes in task performance accuracy and future reward discounting."
https://openalex.org/W1980986084,"Telomere length is maintained by two known mechanisms, the activation of telomerase or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). The molecular mechanisms regulating the ALT phenotype are poorly understood and it is unknown how the decision of which pathway to activate is made at the cellular level. We have shown earlier that active repression of telomerase gene expression by chromatin remodelling of the promoters is one mechanism of regulation; however, other genes and signalling networks are likely to be required to regulate telomerase and maintain the ALT phenotype. Using gene expression profiling, we have uncovered a signature of 1305 genes to distinguish telomerase-positive and ALT cell lines. By combining this with the gene expression profiles of liposarcoma tissue samples, we refined this signature to 297 genes. A network analysis of known interactions between genes within this signature revealed a regulatory signalling network consistent with a model of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) repression in ALT cell lines and liposarcomas. This network expands on our existing knowledge of hTERT regulation and provides a platform to understand differential regulation of hTERT in different tumour types and normal tissues. We also show evidence to suggest a novel mesenchymal stem cell origin for ALT immortalization in cell lines and mesenchymal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2006191615,"Adult female rats continuously exposed to androgens from prepuberty have reproductive and metabolic features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We investigated whether such exposure adversely affects estrous cyclicity and the expression and distribution of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), GnRH receptors, and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the hypothalamus and whether the effects are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR). We also assessed the effect of low-frequency electro-acupuncture (EA) on those variables. At 21 days of age, rats were randomly divided into three groups (control, PCOS, and PCOS EA; n = 12/group) and implanted subcutaneously with 90-day continuous-release pellets containing vehicle or 5α-dihydrostestosterone (DHT). From age 70 days, PCOS EA rats received 2-Hz EA (evoking muscle twitches) five times/week for 4–5 weeks. Hypothalamic protein expression was measured by immunohistochemistry and western blot. DHT-treated rats were acyclic, but controls had regular estrous cycles. In PCOS rats, hypothalamic medial preoptic AR protein expression and the number of AR- and GnRH-immunoreactive cells were increased, but CRH was not affected; however, GnRH receptor expression was decreased in both the pituitary and hypothalamus. Low-frequency EA restored estrous cyclicity within 1 week and reduced the elevated hypothalamic GnRH and AR expression levels. EA did not affect GnRH receptor or CRH expression. Interestingly, nuclear AR co-localized with GnRH in the hypothalamus. Thus, rats with DHT-induced PCOS have disrupted estrous cyclicity and an increased number of hypothalamic cells expressing GnRH, most likely mediated by AR activation. Repeated low-frequency EA normalized estrous cyclicity and restored GnRH and AR protein expression. These results may help explain the beneficial neuroendocrine effects of low-frequency EA in women with PCOS."
https://openalex.org/W2152852598,"Inactivating mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene occur often in the progression of human cancers. p53 inhibits the outgrowth of nascent cancer cells through anti-proliferative actions (including induction of apoptosis or senescence). To test p53 tumor suppressor functions in a novel experimental context, we somatically deleted both p53 alleles in multiple tissues of mice at various ages. Mice homozygously deleted for p53 at 3 months of age showed a longer tumor latency compared to mice deleted for p53 at 6 and 12 months of age. These results are consistent with a model in which tissues accumulate oncogenically activated cells with age and these are held in check by wildtype p53. We also deleted p53 before, concurrent with, and after treatment of mice with ionizing radiation (IR). The absence or presence of p53 during IR treatment had no effect on radiation-induced lymphoma latency, confirming that the immediate p53 damage response was irrelevant for cancer prevention. Even the presence of wildtype p53 for up to four weeks post-IR provided no protection against early lymphoma incidence, indicating that long term maintenance of functional p53 is critical for preventing the emergence of a cancer. These experiments indicate that sustained p53 anti-oncogenic function acts as a final or near final line of defense preventing progression of oncogenically activated cells to malignant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2086204332,"Excessive exposure to dietary fats is an important factor in the initiation of obesity and metabolic syndrome associated pathologies. The cellular processes associated with the onset and progression of diet-induced metabolic syndrome are insufficiently understood.To identify the mechanisms underlying the pathological changes associated with short and long-term exposure to excess dietary fat, hepatic gene expression of ApoE3Leiden mice fed chow and two types of high-fat (HF) diets was monitored using microarrays during a 16-week period. A functional characterization of 1663 HF-responsive genes reveals perturbations in lipid, cholesterol and oxidative metabolism, immune and inflammatory responses and stress-related pathways. The major changes in gene expression take place during the early (day 3) and late (week 12) phases of HF feeding. This is also associated with characteristic opposite regulation of many HF-affected pathways between these two phases. The most prominent switch occurs in the expression of inflammatory/immune pathways (early activation, late repression) and lipogenic/adipogenic pathways (early repression, late activation). Transcriptional network analysis identifies NF-kappaB, NEMO, Akt, PPARgamma and SREBP1 as the key controllers of these processes and suggests that direct regulatory interactions between these factors may govern the transition from early (stressed, inflammatory) to late (pathological, steatotic) hepatic adaptation to HF feeding. This transition observed by hepatic gene expression analysis is confirmed by expression of inflammatory proteins in plasma and the late increase in hepatic triglyceride content. In addition, the genes most predictive of fat accumulation in liver during 16-week high-fat feeding period are uncovered by regression analysis of hepatic gene expression and triglyceride levels.The transition from an inflammatory to a steatotic transcriptional program, possibly driven by the reciprocal activation of NF-kappaB and PPARgamma regulators, emerges as the principal signature of the hepatic adaptation to excess dietary fat. These findings may be of essential interest for devising new strategies aiming to prevent the progression of high-fat diet induced pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1995315410,"Ask1 is a component of the microtubule-binding DASH kinetochore complex. Targeting Ask1 to a yeast plasmid lacking centromeres promotes the recruitment of other kinetochore components and rescues bi-orientation and chromosome segregation. Accurate chromosome segregation depends on the kinetochore, which is the complex of proteins that link microtubules to centromeric DNA1. The kinetochore of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of more than 80 proteins assembled on a 125-bp region of DNA1. We studied the assembly and function of kinetochore components by fusing individual kinetochore proteins to the lactose repressor (LacI) and testing their ability to improve segregation of a plasmid carrying tandem repeats of the lactose operator (LacO). Targeting Ask1, a member of the Dam1–DASH microtubule-binding complex, creates a synthetic kinetochore that performs many functions of a natural kinetochore: it can replace an endogenous kinetochore on a chromosome, bi-orient sister kinetochores at metaphase during the mitotic cycle, segregate sister chromatids, and repair errors in chromosome attachment. We show the synthetic kinetochore functions do not depend on the DNA-binding components of the natural kinetochore but do require other kinetochore proteins. We conclude that tethering a single kinetochore protein to DNA triggers assembly of the complex structure that directs mitotic chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2017794722,This study implicates the proteosome degradation machinery in controlling axon guidance by showing that the deubiquiting enzyme USP33 is essential for controlling Slit/Robo-mediated commissural axonal guidance. Commissural axons cross the ventral midline of the neural tube in a Slit-dependent manner. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We found that the deubiquitinating enzyme USP33 interacts with the Robo1 receptor. USP33 was essential for midline crossing by commissural axons and for their response to Slit. Our results reveal a previously unknown role for USP33 in vertebrate commissural axon guidance and in Slit signaling.
https://openalex.org/W2020646160,"The cytosol of most eukaryotic cells contains multiple highly conserved Hsp70 orthologs that differ mainly by their spatio-temporal expression patterns. Hsp70s play essential roles in protein folding, transport or degradation, and are major players of cellular quality control processes. However, while several reports suggest that specialized functions of Hsp70 orthologs were selected through evolution, few studies addressed systematically this issue.We compared the ability of Ssa1p-Ssa4p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Ssa5p-Ssa8p from the evolutionary distant yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to perform Hsp70-dependent tasks when expressed as the sole Hsp70 for S. cerevisiae in vivo. We show that Hsp70 isoforms (i) supported yeast viability yet with markedly different growth rates, (ii) influenced the propagation and stability of the [PSI(+)] and [URE3] prions, but iii) did not significantly affect the proteasomal degradation rate of CFTR. Additionally, we show that individual Hsp70 orthologs did not induce the formation of different prion strains, but rather influenced the aggregation properties of Sup35 in vivo. Finally, we show that [URE3] curing by the overexpression of Ydj1p is Hsp70-isoform dependent.Despite very high homology and overlapping functions, the different Hsp70 orthologs have evolved to possess distinct activities that are required to cope with different types of substrates or stress situations. Yeast prions provide a very sensitive model to uncover this functional specialization and to explore the intricate network of chaperone/co-chaperone/substrates interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1975881941,"Many anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin (DXR), intercalate into nuclear DNA of cancer cells, thereby inhibiting their growth. However, it is not well understood how such drugs interact with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Using cell and molecular studies of cultured cells, we show that DXR and other DNA intercalators, such as ethidium bromide, can rapidly intercalate into mtDNA within living cells, causing aggregation of mtDNA nucleoids and altering the distribution of nucleoid proteins. Remodelled nucleoids excluded DXR and maintained mtDNA synthesis, whereas non-remodelled nucleoids became heavily intercalated with DXR, which inhibited their replication, thus leading to mtDNA depletion. Remodelling was accompanied by extensive mitochondrial elongation or interconnection, and was suppressed in cells lacking mitofusin 1 and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), the key proteins for mitochondrial fusion. In contrast, remodelling was significantly increased by p53 or ataxia telangiectasia mutated inhibition (ATM), indicating a link between nucleoid dynamics and the genomic DNA damage response. Collectively, our results show that DNA intercalators can trigger a common mitochondrial response, which likely contributes to the marked clinical toxicity associated with these drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1984873332,"The proto-oncogene MYC plays a critical role in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, and its down-regulation by transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signaling is necessary for TGFbeta to inhibit cell proliferation. KLF5, on the other hand, is a pro-proliferative basic transcription factor that reverses function to become an anti-proliferative TGFbeta cofactor upon TGFbeta stimulation in epithelial homeostasis. In this study we investigated whether KLF5 directly regulates MYC transcription in epithelial cells in the context of TGFbeta. Knockdown of KLF5 significantly reduced MYC expression in the HaCaT epidermal epithelial cells. When TGFbeta was applied, however, whereas MYC expression was significantly inhibited, knockdown of KLF5 increased MYC expression. Furthermore, re-expression of KLF5 restored the inhibitory effect of TGFbeta on MYC expression in two cancer cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and oligo pulldown experiments demonstrated that whereas binding of KLF5 to both KLF5 binding element (KBE) and TGFbeta inhibitory element (TIE) DNA elements was necessary for MYC transcription, binding to KBE was decreased by TGFbeta, and binding to TIE was increased by TGFbeta. These results suggest that KLF5 is not only essential for MYC transcription in proliferating epithelial cells but also mediates the inhibitory effect of TGFbeta on MYC transcription. Furthermore, different binding sites mediate different effects of KLF5 in the context of TGFbeta."
https://openalex.org/W2156822413,"Individuals who live to 85 and beyond without developing major age-related diseases may achieve this, in part, by lacking disease susceptibility factors, or by possessing resistance factors that enhance their ability to avoid disease and prolong lifespan. Healthy aging is a complex phenotype likely to be affected by both genetic and environmental factors. We sequenced 24 candidate healthy aging genes in DNA samples from 47 healthy individuals aged eighty-five years or older (the ‘oldest-old’), to characterize genetic variation that is present in this exceptional group. These healthy seniors were never diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, or Alzheimer disease. We re-sequenced all exons, intron-exon boundaries and selected conserved non-coding sequences of candidate genes involved in aging-related processes, including dietary restriction (PPARG, PPARGC1A, SIRT1, SIRT3, UCP2, UCP3), metabolism (IGF1R, APOB, SCD), autophagy (BECN1, FRAP1), stem cell activation (NOTCH1, DLL1), tumor suppression (TP53, CDKN2A, ING1), DNA methylation (TRDMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B) Progeria syndromes (LMNA, ZMPSTE24, KL) and stress response (CRYAB, HSPB2). We detected 935 variants, including 848 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 87 insertion or deletions; 41% (385) were not recorded in dbSNP. This study is the first to present a comprehensive analysis of genetic variation in aging-related candidate genes in healthy oldest-old. These variants and especially our novel polymorphisms are valuable resources to test for genetic association in models of disease susceptibility or resistance. In addition, we propose an innovative tagSNP selection strategy that combines variants identified through gene re-sequencing- and HapMap-derived SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2000615944,"Initially identified in Chlamydomonas, RSP3 (radial spoke protein 3) is 1 of more than 20 identified radial spoke structural components of motile cilia and is required for axonemal sliding and flagellar motility. The mammalian orthologs for this and other radial spoke proteins, however, remain to be characterized. We found mammalian RSP3 to bind to the MAPK ERK2 through a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify interacting proteins that have a higher affinity for the phosphorylated, active form of the protein kinase.

More specifically, how do different MAPK modules integrate various input stimuli and ultimately cause selective activation and actions of these cascades at distinct sites within the cell? Within this context, scaffolding and anchoring proteins are important regulators in coordinating ERK1/2 activity through a variety of mechanisms, including confining and/or dynamically distributing these kinases to distinct sites of action in the cell and integrating multiple inputs into the ERK1/2 MAPK cascade from other signaling modalities to allow for the divergent responses of the ERK1/2 pathway (1Raman M. Chen W. Cobb M.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3100-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Scaffolds and anchoring proteins may also affect the magnitude and duration of signals through the pathway, mediate cross-talk with other pathways, and serve in inhibitory roles, preventing inappropriate action of the kinases in certain cellular compartments (2Elion E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3967-3978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Scaffolds themselves are often regulated and may be subject to multiple post-translational modifications, e.g. phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitylation. These modifications may regulate the stability of the scaffolds as well as their roles in interconnecting pathways in a manner dependent on the particular stimulus or change in cell context (3Kolch W.

One particularly well characterized class of scaffolding proteins are the protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that bind to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) holoenzyme (5Rubin C.S.

PKA is a ubiquitous protein kinase involved in numerous regulatory events in the cell and is composed of two catalytic subunits and two regulatory subunits. The PKA holoenzyme is classified as type I or type II, based on the regulatory subunits, RIα/β or RIIα/β, present in the heterotetrameric complex (7Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M.

AKAPs concentrate PKA holoenzymes to defined locations within the cell, where the catalytic subunits can phosphorylate surrounding substrates in response to increased concentrations of cAMP, thus providing spatiotemporal specificity to PKA activity and cAMP-dependent signaling. AKAPs bind to hydrophobic residues of the N-terminal dimerization interface of the regulatory subunits via a conserved 14–18-residue amphipathic helical region (8Taskén K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). More than 50 AKAPs have been identified, many with multivalent binding capacity, interacting not only with PKA but also with components of often disparate signaling pathways. AKAPs have the ability to integrate multiple inputs and facilitate cross-talk of pathways as a function of these specific interactions, resulting in unique, localized outcomes within the cell. RSP3 (radial spoke protein 3) is one of at least 23 known radial spoke proteins identified in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and is assembled in a large multisubunit complex required for flagellar motility (11Yang P. Diener D.R. Yang C. Kohno T. Pazour G.J. Dienes J.M. Agrin N.S. King S.M. Sale W.S. Kamiya R. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Radial spoke proteins are thought to be important in transducing signals from the inner pair of microtubules to the outer doublets in the flagellar axoneme, regulating dynein-mediated axonemal sliding and subsequent flagellar motility. Genetic analysis of RSP3 function in Chlamydomonas indicates that flagella are paralyzed, and radial spokes are not assembled in the absence of RSP3 (12Luck D. Piperno G. Ramanis Z. Huang B. Proc.

Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Additionally, biochemical studies of Chlamydomonas RSP3 show that it is an AKAP, and loss of its ability to bind to PKA also results in abnormal flagellar motility and paralyzed flagella (14Gaillard A.R.

Cell. 2006; 17: 2626-2635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, RSP3 has been shown to form a homodimer within the radial spoke structure. This dimer is proposed to provide the base for radial spoke assembly (16Wirschell M. Zhao F. Yang C. Yang P. Diener D. Gaillard A. Rosenbaum J.L. Sale W.S. Cell Motil.

Mammals contain one RSP3 gene (mapped to chromosomal locus 6q25.3), composed of eight exons and seven introns. The gene is believed to contain alternative start sites that generate two transcripts to produce a long and a short form. The short form, annotated as RSP3, is made up of 418 amino acids, whereas the 560-amino acid-long form, extended by 142 amino acids at the N terminus, is referred to as RSPH3 (radial spoke protein homolog 3). Human and mouse RSP3 are ∼84% similar at the amino acid level and share 67% similarity within the radial spoke domain to Chlamydomonas RSP3. The radial spoke domain and the AKAP domain of RSP3 are conserved among a variety of species. The mammalian orthologs for this and other radial spoke proteins, however, have not been characterized. Here we describe the interaction of mammalian RSP3/RSPH3 with ERK1/2 and PKA and describe some features of its regulation. This work identifies the only AKAP thus far known to interact with components of the ERK1/2 kinase cascade. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% l-glutamine at 5% CO2. Generally, cells were reverse-transfected using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1.5 μg of plasmid(s) was used in transfections, and cells were harvested 36–40 h post-transfection. After indicated treatments as described under “Results” and figure legends, cells were washed twice with iced phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.6 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, Nα-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, pepstatin A, and leupeptin. After 15 min on ice, lysates were frozen in N2 (liquid) and thawed on ice, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at −80 °C until further analysis. Human RSPH3 in a pSPORT6 vector was obtained from ATCC and cloned into pCMV7.1 N-terminal 3xFLAG vector for mammalian expression. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate RSPH3 mutants in ERK1/2 phosphorylation sites and the AKAP domain. 3xFLAG-RSPH3 truncation mutants were also generated.

For immunoprecipitations, cell extracts containing 1 mg of total protein were pre-cleared with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C prior to incubation with the indicated primary antibodies (1:250 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. Then 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads was incubated with the lysate for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 3 min prior to three 10-min washes with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl. The beads were subsequently boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris-HCl) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat powdered milk in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl (TBS) for 2 h at 4 °C, incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 in 5% milk in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. In some cases, immunoblots were analyzed by densitometry using Image J. After washing the immunoprecipitates as above, protein A-Sepharose beads were washed with 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2. Beads were subsequently resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, and 1 mm benzamidine. Recombinant active phosphorylated ERK2 (pERK2) and the purified catalytic subunit of PKA, each prepared as described (21Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H.

Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), were used as enzymes. Immunoprecipitation kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions contained 10 μm ATP in a 30-μl total reaction volume (60–70 cpm/fmol [γ-32P]ATP). Reactions were quenched with Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels in SDS, stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and analyzed using autoradiography. One μg of His6-RSP3 phosphorylated in vitro with pERK2 was hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl, and the products were resolved by electrophoresis on a thin layer plate using a Hunter apparatus as described previously (23Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 24Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). The migration of phosphorylated residues from the samples was compared with migration of phosphoamino acid standards visualized with ninhydrin. Results are expressed as means determined from at least three independent experiments. Bars represent S.E. Statistical significance was calculated using paired or unpaired one- or two-tail t tests or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis as indicated in the figure legends. Densitometric quantification of immunoblots was performed using ImageJ. Scanned images of film exposed with intensities of bands in the linear range as determined by exposure of a sensitometer imprinting an intensity gradient on the film were used for all quantification analyses. The interaction between ERK2 and RSP3 was found through a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify interacting proteins that have a higher affinity for the phosphorylated active form of ERK2. Yeast were transformed with bait vectors containing an ERK2 and active MEK1 (MEK1R4F) co-expression plasmid (25Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ERK2 alone, or MEK1R4F alone, along with a fetal mouse brain cDNA library as prey. Growth on restrictive medium and β-galactosidase activity were used as readouts for an interaction. RSP3 was identified and bound 2.5-fold more strongly to ERK2 co-expressed with active MEK1 than to ERK2 alone, based on β-galactosidase activity. To test the yeast two-hybrid finding, 3xFLAG-tagged RSPH3 or empty vector was expressed in HEK293 cells, and endogenous ERK1/2 was immunoprecipitated. 3xFLAG-RSPH3 was readily detected in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1A). 3xFLAG-RSPH3 also co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged ERK2 (data not shown), consistent with the two-hybrid result suggesting that phosphorylation and activation of the kinase are not required. Despite a theoretical molecular mass of 67 kDa with the 3xFLAG epitope, 3xFLAG-RSPH3 migrates between 75 and 90 kDa on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. This slower migration is characteristic of several AKAPs and has been attributed to the exposed charge of the amphipathic helical domain. The two-hybrid screen that identified RSP3 used a bait that also contained MEK1. Thus, we determined whether RSP3 also had the ability to bind to the upstream protein kinase MEK1. In a two-hybrid test, RSP3 interacted most strongly with ERK2 co-expressed with MEK1R4F; weaker binding was also detected with ERK2 alone, as noted earlier (Fig. 1B). RSP3 also bound to MEK1R4F alone but less so to wild-type MEK1 (see Fig. 2E), suggesting that RSP3 binds directly not only to ERK1/2 but also to active MEK1. Subsequently, endogenous ERK1/2, MEK1, and the ERK1/2 substrate protein kinase Rsk were immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells expressing 3xFLAG-RSPH3. Tagged RSPH3 co-precipitated with ERK1/2, MEK1, and Rsk but not with an unrelated protein kinase OSR1 (Fig. 1C, upper and lower panels). Co-precipitation with MEK1 was weaker than with Rsk or ERK1/2. Truncation mutants of RSPH3 were generated to identify the minimal ERK1/2-interacting region within RSPH3. Residues 187–476 represent the conserved radial spoke 3 domain as defined for the Chlamydomonas protein. FLAG-tagged truncation mutants of RSPH3, residues 1–476 and 1–187, readily co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous ERK1/2. Binding of residues 187–476 to ERK1/2, although detectable, was diminished (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with binding of ERK1/2 to the first 187 amino acids of RSPH3 with a possible contribution from more C-terminal residues. The two best described motifs that bind ERK1/2 are the FXF motif and the docking or D motif. Hydrophobic FXF motifs bind to ERK2 near the MAPK insert and underlying structures (26Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 27Lee T. Hoofnagle A.N. Kabuyama Y. Stroud J. Min X. Goldsmith E.J. Chen L. Resing K.A.

Verykokakis M. Yazicioglu M.N. Sakarellos-Daitsiotis M. Cobb M.H. Mavrothalassitis G. J. Biol.

D motifs, characterized by a basic/hydrophobic consensus sequence, interact in the common docking (CD) region of ERK1/2 and are thought to bind preferentially to unphosphorylated ERK1/2 (30Yang S.H.

Because RSPH3 binds better to pERK1/2, we first mutated the three FXF motifs in RSPH3, singly or together to test for loss of RSPH3-ERK1/2 binding. The four resulting mutants were able to co-immunoprecipitate with ERK1/2 in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type RSPH3 (Fig. 2C). A recent analysis using peptides suggested that tryptophan and tyrosine could replace phenylalanine in this type of motif (34Sheridan D.L. Kong Y. Parker S.A. Dalby K.N. Turk B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19511-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, a fourth motif, including Trp-111, was mutated that also did not appear to disrupt the interaction with ERK1/2 (Fig. 2C). RSPH3 contains no strongly predicted D motifs (35Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar), but near its N terminus is a sequence (LAKRR) identical to the ERK-binding sequence from the protein kinases Msk and Mnk that are ERK1/2 substrates (36Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3500) Google Scholar). To test its potential role, the first 20 amino acids of RSPH3 were deleted, but the interaction was retained (Fig. 2D). Because these motifs were apparently not important for ERK1/2 binding, we used an unbiased approach to elucidate the nature of the interaction. A two-hybrid library of ERK2 mutants (37Robinson F.L. Whitehurst A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was screened with RSPH3 to find ERK2 binding-deficient mutants. Through this screen ERK2 H123Y was found to have impaired binding to RSPH3 (data not shown). This residue lies on the side opposite of the ERK2 active site near the CD region that binds D motifs (Fig. 2B). Thus, we compared RSP3 binding using ERK2 mutants defective in D motif and FXF interactions by pairwise yeast two-hybrid tests (Fig. 2E). Mutations within the MAPK insert (Y261N) and the MAPK insert deletion (Δ241–272), which disrupt FXF-mediated interactions, bound to RSP3 as well as did wild-type ERK2, consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation studies with RSPH3 FXF mutants. On the other hand, mutations in the CD region (D316A and D319A) showed reduced binding to RSP3. This suggests that as yet unidentified basic/hydrophobic D-like motifs within RSPH3 mediate its interaction with ERK1/2. To test whether ERK1/2 activity affected the interaction with RSPH3 in a mammalian cell system, HEK293 cells expressing 3xFLAG-RSPH3 were treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, which inhibits the subsequent activation of ERK1/2, or DMSO as a control, for 10 min prior to immunoprecipitation of endogenous ERK1/2. Under these conditions, no apparent difference in co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed RSPH3 with ERK1/2 was observed between the control- and U0126-treated samples (Fig. 2F). In vitro kinase assays performed with recombinant pERK1 and immunoprecipitated RSPH3 from HEK293 lysates or recombinant His6-RSP3 showed that RSP3 and RSPH3 are indeed substrates (Fig. 3, A and B). Recombinant His6-RSP3 was also used in in vitro kinase assays for phospho-residue identification (Fig. 3A). Phosphoamino acid analysis indicates that pERK1 predominantly phosphorylates threonine in RSP3/RSPH3. In silico prediction of consensus ERK1/2 phosphorylation motifs suggested the major site to be threonine 286 (35Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Mutation of this residue to alanine in RSPH3 (T286A) attenuated phosphorylation by ERK1 by ∼70% in immunoprecipitation kinase assays (Fig. 3B). Labeling of cells with 32P indicated that RSPH3 phosphorylation is increased upon stimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Fig. 4, A and B). Radiolabeled phosphate incorporation into RSPH3 was diminished by pretreatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, suggesting that at least a portion of this phosphorylation is ERK1/-dependent. Furthermore, the extent of radiolabeled phosphate incorporation into RSPH3 T286A was much less than that into wild-type RSPH3, suggesting that threonine 286 is the major ERK1/2 phosphorylation site in cells. ERK2 also phosphorylates RSPH3 on threonine 243 to a lesser extent. Phosphorylation of the double mutant T243V/T286A RSPH3 was no more than 20% that of wild-type RSPH3 (Fig. 4, C and D). Chlamydomonas RSP3 has been shown to bind to the regulatory subunits of PKA in vitro in a similar manner to other known AKAPs. Orthologs of RSP3 exist in a variety of species, all of which contain a highly conserved similar sequence in the AKAP R-subunit binding domain (14Gaillard A.R. Diener D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether the human isoform of RSPH3 has a similar AKAP function. 3xFLAG-RSPH3 and Myc-tagged RIIα, RIIβ, and RIα were co-expressed in HEK293 cells, and 3xFLAG-RSPH3 was immunoprecipitated. RIIα and RIIβ co-immunoprecipitated with RSPH3, whereas RIα did not, indicating that RSPH3 preferentially interacts with the type II PKA holoenzyme (Fig. 5A). Overexpressed RSPH3 also co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous RIIα and RIIβ, further confirming an interaction with the regulatory subunits of PKA (Fig. 5B). Mutation of residues threonine 325 and isoleucine 326 to alanines (T325A/I326A) within the amphipathic helix of RSPH3, which are critical for PKA regulatory subunit binding and helix folding, disrupted the co-immunoprecipitation interaction observed with overexpressed wild-type RSPH3 (Fig. 5, C–E). Ile-326 in RSPH3 is thought to bind within a hydrophobic groove created by R-subunit dimerization. In vitro kinase assays indicated that the purified catalytic subunit of PKA phosphorylates both wild-type and T286A mutant 3xFLAG-RSPH3 similarly (Fig. 5F). We next asked whether phosphorylation of RSPH3 by ERK1/2 has any consequence on RSPH3 AKAP function. We found that mutating the ERK1/2 phosphorylation site in RSPH3 affected its ability to co-immunoprecipitate with the regulatory subunits of PKA. Co-immunoprecipitation of the T286A mutant with endogenous RIIα or RIIβ was enhanced by ∼1.8-fold compared with wild-type overexpressed 3xFLAG-RSPH3 (Fig. 6A). Treating cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, which inhibits the subsequent activation of ERK1/2, diminished the interaction of RSPH3 with endogenous RIIα, however. HEK293 cells expressing 3xFLAG-RSPH3 were treated with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μm U0126 or DMSO as a control for 10 min prior to immunoprecipitation of RIIα (Fig. 6, B and C). Stimulation with fresh serum-containing medium caused an expected increase in pERK1/2, and this activity was decreased in U0126-treated samples. U0126 also decreased RSPH3 in the RIIα immunoprecipitate by ∼70%, suggesting that inhibiting ERK1/2 activity decreases AKAP function of RSPH3. This was unexpected because of the enhanced interaction of the T286A mutant with RIIα. To examine the interaction between RSPH3 and RIIα further, a kinetic analysis of the effects of serum and U0126 upon the interaction was performed. The culture medium of RSPH3-transfected HEK293 cells was changed to fresh serum-containing medium supplemented with 10 μm U0126 or DMSO as a control for 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min prior to lysis (Fig. 6D). As expected ERK1/2 activity was decreased by U0126. The difference in the amount of RSPH3 that co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous RIIα was negligible between untreated and samples treated with serum plus DMSO (control) for 1 min. Thereafter, the interaction between RIIα and RSPH3 was consistently diminished in the presence of U0126 over the time course of the experiment; the average reduction in RSPH3 pulled down with RIIα was 50% at all time points measured (Fig. 6D). Thus, inhibiting ERK1/2 activity appears to negatively regulate the AKAP function of RSPH3. Our findings reveal that mammalian RSPH3 is an ERK1/2-interacting AKAP; mutating residues within the amphipathic helix of RSPH3 (T325A/I326A) disrupted its interaction with RIIα, behavior typical of a bona fide AKAP. These findings on the human ortholog of RSP3 support previous work showing that the blue-green algae protein is an AKAP. Importantly, we show that RSPH3 binds multiple components of the ERK1/2 module, and at the interactions with ERK1/2 and MEK1 are most likely direct. The yeast two-hybrid screen identified RSP3 as an interacting protein that has a higher affinity for the phosphorylated and active form of ERK2. Both two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation show that RSPH3 binds both pERK2 and ERK1/2. Consistent with weaker but significant binding to the unphosphorylated kinase, inhibiting ERK1/2 activation with U0126 did not disrupt the ability of RSPH3 to co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous ERK1/2. Corollary experiments using EGF and forskolin to activate the ERK1/2 and PKA signaling pathways, respectively, did not cause an apparent change in co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Based on interactions with ERK2 mutants defective in binding to D or FXF motifs, RSPH3 most likely binds to ERK1/2, phosphorylated or not, through a D motif-CD region interaction. D motifs are not highly conserved sequences; consensus D motifs were not readily identified in RSPH3; as a result, we have not yet determined the relevant region of RSPH3 that binds to ERK1/2. Although the several FXF motifs on RSPH3 do not appear to contribute substantially to ERK1/2 binding, RSPH3, like other ERK1/2-binding proteins, may contain combinations of D and FXF that may function synergistically or contribute to differential interactions with the MAPKs depending on spatiotemporal or cellular context. The major site of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in RSPH3 is Thr-286 within a MAPK consensus motif. Radiolabeled phosphate incorporation into RSPH3 in response to EGF was not completely abolished by mutating Thr-286, or a second minor site Thr-243, or by blocking ERK1/2 activation. In addition to PKA and ERK1/2, our experiments suggest that there are additional EGF-sensitive, ERK1/2-independent protein kinases that also phosphorylate RSPH3. These phosphorylations may also influence interactions of RSPH3 with these signaling proteins as well as the resulting output. Inhibiting ERK1/2 activation and subsequent activity decreased the amount of RSPH3 that co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous RIIα. Mutating the major ERK1/2 phosphorylation site in RSPH3 to alanine, however, increased the capacity of RSPH3 to co-immunoprecipitate with RIIα. Although mutation of a phosphorylation site to a small hydrophobic residue is generally expected to have an effect opposite to phosphorylation of that residue, several studies have found that removing the hydroxyl group alone, as in a Thr to Ala or Val mutation, is sufficient to mimic phosphorylation (38Proft M. Struhl K. Cell. 2004; 118: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the mutation may cause a conformational change in RSPH3 that indirectly affects interactions; this has been noted in several transcription factors (39Lee H.Y. Suh Y.A. Robinson M.J. Clifford J.L. Hong W.K. Woodgett J.R. Cobb M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kurie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32193-32199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Such a change might alter RIIα binding to RSPH3 relative to the unphosphorylated wild-type protein. It also must be pointed out that the decreasing interaction of RSPH3 with RIIα observed at early time points after addition of fresh serum-containing medium was consistent with the T286A mutant experiments, suggesting that there are multiple changes that take place upon ERK1/2 activation only one of which may be affected by phosphorylation of Thr-286. This idea is also suggested by the time course of binding in the presence of U0126, i.e. reduced RIIα binding at 1 and 2.5 min but a smaller effect at longer times of exposure. In summary, we have identified RSPH3 as an AKAP that may serve as a point of convergence for ERK1/2 and PKA signaling in cilia. Proteomic analysis of human bronchial epithelial cells and immunofluorescence staining of mouse tracheal epithelial cells have shown that RSP3 is present in motile cilia of mammals (16Wirschell M.

Consistent with our findings, MEK1 and a phosphorylated form have also been found in cilia (40Schneider L. Clement C.A. Teilmann S.C. Pazour G.J. Hoffmann E.K. Satir P. Christensen S.T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1861-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Until this study, AKAPs have not been found directly associated with MAPK pathways. The muscle-specific AKAP mAKAP binds proteins involved in feedback loops with phosphodiesterase 4D3 and a cAMP-sensitive guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Epac1, regulating cAMP levels in cardiac myocytes (41Dodge-Kafka K.L. Soughayer J. Pare G.C. Carlisle Michel J.J. Langeberg L.K. Kapiloff M.S. Scott J.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). mAKAP coordinates PKA function with the ERK5 MAPK pathway. However, ERK5 binds indirectly to mAKAP through a direct interaction with the phosphodiesterase. MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2), an ERK1/2 substrate, is also an AKAP (42Hausken Z.E. Dell'Acqua M.L. Coghlan V.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29016-29022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 may facilitate regulation of microtubules in part through MAP2 interactions. Although stable binding of ERK1/2 to microtubules is well documented (43Reszka A.A. Seger R. Diltz C.D. Krebs E.G.

Thus, it is possible that RSPH3 stands alone as an ERK1/2-binding AKAP. The purpose of PKA and ERK1/2 binding to RSPH3 may be to orchestrate RSP3 actions in ciliary motility. The fact that the AKAP function of RSPH3 is regulated in an ERK1/2-dependent manner suggests that there may be additional ciliary functions associated with this ERK1/2-associated AKAP that remain to be determined.

Parkin, an ubiquitin-protein ligase that is dysfunctional in autosomal recessive parkinsonism, protects against alpha-synuclein-mediated toxicity in various models.We analyzed the effects of Parkin deficiency in a mouse model of synucleinopathy to explore the possibility that Parkin and alpha-synuclein act in the same biochemical pathway. Whether or not Parkin was present, these mice developed an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder preceded by a progressive decline in performance in tasks predictive of sensorimotor dysfunction. The symptoms were accompanied by the deposition of P(S129)-alpha-synuclein but not P(S87)-alpha-synuclein in neuronal cell bodies and neuritic processes throughout the brainstem and the spinal cord; activation of caspase 9 was observed in 5% of the P(S129)-alpha-synuclein-positive neurons. As in Lewy bodies, ubiquitin-immunoreactivity, albeit less abundant, was invariably co-localized with P(S129)-alpha-synuclein. During late disease stages, the disease-specific neuropathological features revealed by ubiquitin- and P(S129)-alpha-synuclein-specific antibodies were similar in mice with or without Parkin. However, the proportion of P(S129)-alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies and neurites co-stained for ubiquitin was lower in the absence than in the presence of Parkin, suggesting less advanced synucleinopathy. Moreover, sensorimotor impairment and manifestation of the neurodegenerative phenotype due to overproduction of human alpha-synuclein were significantly delayed in Parkin-deficient mice.These findings raise the possibility that effective compensatory mechanisms modulate the phenotypic expression of disease in parkin-related parkinsonism."
https://openalex.org/W1972307942,"Background Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading cause of mental retardation in the western world and children with FASD present altered somatosensory, auditory and visual processing. There is growing evidence that some of these sensory processing problems may be related to altered cortical maps caused by impaired developmental neuronal plasticity. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that the primary visual cortex of ferrets exposed to alcohol during the third trimester equivalent of human gestation have decreased CREB phosphorylation and poor orientation selectivity revealed by western blotting, optical imaging of intrinsic signals and single-unit extracellular recording techniques. Treating animals several days after the period of alcohol exposure with a phosphodiesterase type 1 inhibitor (Vinpocetine) increased CREB phosphorylation and restored orientation selectivity columns and neuronal orientation tuning. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that CREB function is important for the maturation of orientation selectivity and that plasticity enhancement by vinpocetine may play a role in the treatment of sensory problems in FASD."
https://openalex.org/W2037078303,"The human copper transporter hCTR1 is a homotrimer composed of a plasma membrane protein of 190 amino acids that contains three transmembrane segments. The extracellular 65-amino acid amino terminus of hCTR1 contains both N-linked (at Asn(15)) and O-linked (at Thr(27)) sites of glycosylation. If O-glycosylation at Thr(27) is prevented, hCTR1 is efficiently cleaved, removing approximately 30 amino acids from the amino terminus. We have now investigated (i) the site of this cleavage, determining which peptide bonds are cleaved, (ii) the mechanism by which glycosylation prevents cleavage, and (iii) where in the cell the proteolytic cleavage takes place. Cleavage occurs in the sequence Ala-Ser-His-Ser-His (residues 29-33), which does not contain previously recognized protease cleavage sites. Using a series of hCTR1 mutants, we show that cleavage occurs preferentially between residues Ala(29)-Ser(30)-His(31). We also show that the O-linked polysaccharide at Thr(27) blocks proteolysis due to its proximity to the cleavage site. Moving the cleavage site away from the Thr(27) polysaccharide by insertion of as few as 5 amino acids allows cleavage to occur in the presence of glycosylation. Imaging studies using immunofluorescence in fixed cells and a functional green fluorescent protein-tagged hCTR1 transporter in live cells showed that the cleaved peptide accumulates in punctate structures in the cytoplasm. These puncta overlap compartments were stained by Rab9, indicating that hCTR1 cleavage occurs in a late endosomal compartment prior to delivery of the transporter to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2171230685,"Immature dendritic cells (DC) represent potential clinical tools for tolerogenic cellular immunotherapy in both transplantation and autoimmunity. A major drawback in vivo is their potential to mature during infections or inflammation, which would convert their tolerogenicity into immunogenicity. The generation of immature DC from human bone marrow (BM) by low doses of GM-CSF (lowGM) in the absence of IL-4 under GMP conditions create DC resistant to maturation, detected by surface marker expression and primary stimulation by allogeneic T cells. This resistence could not be observed for BM-derived DC generated with high doses of GM-CSF plus IL-4 (highGM/4), although both DC types induced primary allogeneic T cell anergy in vitro. The estabishment of the anergic state requires two subsequent stimulations by immature DC. Anergy induction was more profound with lowGM-DC due to their maturation resistance. Together, we show the generation of immature, maturation-resistant lowGM-DC for potential clinical use in transplant rejection and propose a two-step-model of T cell anergy induction by immature DC."

We found that both MG132 (>1 microM) and Bortezomib (>0.025 microM) induced a significant apoptosis in NCI-H1703, a PI-sensitive NSCLC cell line, through initially activating the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, leading to the activation of a positive feedback mechanism (PFM), which then conveyed apoptosis signaling from the intrinsic pathway to the extrinsic pathway with formation of a signaling loop for maximal caspase activation. Mcl-1 and Noxa were identified to be the major anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic proteins, respectively, in PI-induced apoptosis and mutually exclusive in protein stability. Although the Mcl-1 protein was upregulated by proteasome inhibition, it was also subjected to caspase 3-dependent cleavage governed by the PFM. Moreover, it was revealed that Mcl-1 protein cleavage contributed to PFM-governed apoptosis in following inter-related ways: reducing the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1; generating the truncated proapoptotic Mcl-1(S); and inducing a shift of balance between Mcl-1 and Noxa. It was further manifested that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand boosted MG132's proapoptotic activity through strengthening the PFM in both NCI-H1703 and NCI-H358, a PI-resistant NSCLC cell line. Therefore, this study provides a basis for enhancing the efficacy of PIs in treating NSCLC."

Nicastrin (NCT), a single-pass membrane glycoprotein that harbors a large extracellular domain, is an essential component of the γ-secretase complex. Here we report that overexpression of a single chain variable fragment (scFv) against NCT as an intrabody suppressed the γ-secretase activity. Biochemical analyses revealed that the scFv disrupted the proper folding and the appropriate glycosyl maturation of the endogenous NCT, which are required for the stability of the γ-secretase complex and the intrinsic proteolytic activity, respectively, implicating the dual role of NCT in the γ-secretase complex. Our results also highlight the importance of the calnexin cycle in the functional maturation of the γ-secretase complex.

Molecular and cellular analyses revealed that the trypsin resistance, presumably indicating the proper structural folding of NCT, might be directly linked to the enzymatic activity, whereas the complex glycosylation is dispensable. Moreover, multiple sequence alignment analyses revealed that NCT ECD have a similarity to an aminopeptidase (18Fagan R. Swindells M. Overington J. Weir M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 213-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas certain catalytic residues are not conserved. Recently one study has suggested that NCT plays a critical role in substrate recognition (19Shah S. Lee S.F. Tabuchi K. Hao Y.H. Yu C. LaPlant Q. Ball H. Dann 3rd, C.E. Südhof T. Yu G. Cell. 2005; 122: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). During the proteolytic process, NCT ECD captures the most N terminus of the substrate as a primary substrate receptor (i.e. exosite) for the γ-secretase via the aminopeptidase-like domain. However, this view has been recently challenged (20Chávez-Gutiérrez L. Tolia A. Maes E. Li T. Wong P.C. de Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20096-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as structural information of NCT ECD is totally lacking, the functional role of the structural maturation of NCT in the formation and activity of the γ-secretase remains unclear. Molecular engineering of monoclonal antibodies opens a venue for the functional analyses of targeted molecule and the therapeutic intervention for several diseases (21Holliger P. Hudson P.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). A single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) is comprised of heavy- and light-chain sequences of an antibody linked by a short linker and preserves binding abilities of its parental antibody. scFv can be expressed intracellularly as an intrabody (22Miller T.W.

Intrabodies have been investigated as treatments for a variety of pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease and Huntington disease. Moreover, several recent publications have highlighted the therapeutic potential of intrabodies targeting intra- as well as extracellular epitopes (24Verbeke K. Gils A. Declerck P.J. J. Thromb.

Unexpectedly, the overexpression of the anti-NCT scFv as an intrabody abolished the proteolytic activity by the destabilization of the γ-secretase complex and the inappropriate glycosylation of NCT. This is the first example showing that engineered antibody would be a useful tool for the direct modulation of the γ-secretase complex and its activity.

Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from 1 × 107 hybridoma cells by using Isogen reagent (Nippongene, Tokyo, Japan). The cells were lysed by mixing with Isogen and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After centrifugation of the lysate, the RNA was precipitated and dissolved in distilled water. This RNA was used as a template for first-strand cDNA synthesis with 3′ primers specific for the mouse IgG genes (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). The cDNA fragments were then amplified by PCR with LA Taq (Takara, Shiga, Japan) using 3′ and 5′ primers from the mouse Ig primer set as per the manufacturer's instructions (Ig-Prime kit protocols; Novagen). The PCR products were subcloned into the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) by the TOPO cloning method. scFv cDNAs inserted into pSecTag2C (Invitrogen) were constructed as follows. The PCR-derived DNA fragments in pEF6/V5-His TOPO were subjected to splice overlapping extension PCR to connect heavy- and light-chain genes to give a single fusion protein gene. In the first round PCR, heavy- and light-chain genes were amplified by using the following primers: the variable region heavy-chain gene, 5′-ggggaattcGAAGTGAAGCTGGTGGAG-3′ (VHF#1) and 5′-caccacctccggaaccaccaccaccggaaccaccacctccGGCTGAGGAGACTGTGAGAGT-3′ (VHR#1); the variable region light-chain genes, 5′- ggtggttccggtggtggtggttccggaggtggtggttcaGACATTGTGCTGACACAGTCT-3′ (VLF#1) and 5′-cccgcggccgcTTTTATTTCCAGCTTGGT-3′ (VLR#1) or 5′-ggtggttccggtggtggtggttccggaggtggtggttcaGATATCCAGATGACACAGACT-3′ (VLF#2) and 5′- cccgcggccgcTTTGATTTCCAGCTTGGT-3′ (VLR#2). In the second round PCR, the amplified heavy- and light-chain fragments were linked by using VHF#1 and VLR#1 or #2. The amplified scFv cDNAs were digested with EcoRI and NotI to subclone into the EcoRI-NotI-digested pSecTag2C vector. Wild-type as well as mutant (i.e. Δ312, 648ATAA) human NCT inserted in the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO was generated as previously described (14Tomita T. Katayama R. Takikawa R. Iwatsubo T.

For NCT ECD production, Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant virus encoding NCT ECD at multiplicity of infection 2 and incubated for 72 h. For scFv, 5201F-expressing cells (clone 2) were incubated in regular media for 72 h. NCT ECD or scFv was recovered from the culture media by using a nickel-chelating column (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted by a stepwise gradient of imidazole (5–300 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline. Eluted fractions were analyzed by Coomassie or silver staining as well as immunoblotting. Purified NCT ECD or bovine serum albumin was coated on 96-well plates at the concentration of 2 μg/ml in a coating buffer (0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.6), and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After the coating, the plates were blocked by a blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1× BlockAce (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, Osaka, Japan) and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) and stored at 4 °C until used. A5201A, anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), as a positive control or mouse IgG fraction (SIGMA) as a negative control was added at various concentrations to the wells, and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C.

Using this technology, we have generated a monoclonal antibody A5201A that specifically binds to NCT ECD. A5201A showed specific binding ability to V5-tagged NCT ECD in a similar manner to anti-V5 antibody, whereas an irrelevant IgG exhibited no reactivity (Fig. 1). Next, we generated two intrabodies based on A5201A, named 5201C and 5201F. Both intrabodies consist of light and heavy chain variable regions that were cloned from hybridoma cells producing A5201A, conjugated with three GGGGS pentapeptide repeats as a linker by PCR. Each cDNA was cloned into a pSecTag2C vector, which enables the targeting of the intrabodies into the lumen by the Igκ leader sequence and detection with c-myc tag attached to the C terminus (Fig. 2A). 5201C and 5201F harbored a difference only in the light chain variable region sequences, whereas the heavy chain variable region sequences were totally identical.

Immunoblot analysis revealed that both intrabodies were expressed intracellularly as a ∼36-kDa protein and secreted into culture media. Intriguingly, the expression levels of NCT, especially that of mature NCT, were markedly reduced in 5201F-expressing cell lines, and the remaining “mature-like” NCT showed slightly longer migration on SDS-PAGE than that of mock- or 5201C-expressing cells. Hereafter, we refer to this mature-like NCT of ∼115 kDa observed in 5201F-expressing cells as NCT*. Moreover, the protein levels of other components of the γ-secretase complex, i.e. PS1, APH-1aL, and PEN-2, were also decreased in 5201F-expressing cells. In contrast, none of the γ-secretase components was affected in 5201C-expressing cells. Next, we examined whether the intrinsic γ-secretase activity was affected in the intrabody-expressing cells by in vitro assay using an APP-based recombinant substrate (3Takasugi N. Tomita T.

We then normalized the activity against the levels of PS1 CTF to measure the specific activity per active complex (20Chávez-Gutiérrez L. Tolia A. Maes E. Li T. Wong P.C. de Strooper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20096-20105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 5201F-expressing cells showed significant reduction in the Aβ-generating activities (for Aβ40, 34.5% (#2) and 23.9% (#4) compared with that of mock cells; for Aβ42, 21.3% (#2) and 39.4% (#4)) (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the overexpression of intrabody 5201F, but not 5201C, reduces the steady-state expression levels as well as the intrinsic activity of the γ-secretase complex. We then examined the interactions of the intrabodies with the γ-secretase complex by immunoprecipitation analysis. NCT* as well as immature NCT were co-precipitated with intrabody only from 5201F-expressing cells (Fig. 3). All γ-secretase components were also detected in the immunoprecipitates with 5201F. These data suggest that 5201F directly interacts with NCT and that 5201F-bound NCT is incorporated into the γ-secretase complex. Unexpectedly, however, 5201F purified from conditioned media failed to pull down NCT from HEK cell lysates (Fig. 4). Then, we transiently expressed intrabody in the presence or absence of human NCT in NKO cells (32Li T. Ma G. Cai H. Price D.L. Wong P.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and performed the immunoprecipitation analysis using mixed lysates. The coexpressed 5201F precipitated NCT polypeptides, whereas the intrabody in NKO cells failed to interact with the independently expressed NCT (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that the intrabody 5201F is incorporated into the γ-secretase complex during its assembly process. Moreover, significant reduction of mature NCT was observed in stable NKO cells coexpressing 5201F and human NCT in a similar manner to that in HEK293 cells expressing 5201F, suggesting that 5201F was able to form NCT* in NKO cells (supplementary Fig. S2). Next, we analyzed the location of the epitope of the intrabody 5201F using systematically deleted constructs (NCT/Δ1-Δ5) of NCT ECD (17Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Capell A. Schmitz J. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16474-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) in NKO cells. Previous results have suggested that these deletion constructs encode loss-of-function mutant forms of NCT. Although 5201F bound to all deletion NCT mutants, the immunoreactivities against NCT/Δ2, Δ3, Δ4, and Δ5 were significantly reduced, suggesting that 5201F directly recognizes a broad region in NCT ECD irrespective of the formation of functional γ-secretase complex (Fig. 5, C and D). Collectively, these results suggest that the intracellularly expressed scFv 5201F directly targets the nascent or newly synthesized NCT polypeptides during the biosynthetic pathway and is incorporated into the γ-secretase complex.FIGURE 4Secreted 5201F failed to bind NCT. A, culture media of 5201F-expressing cells were applied to a nickel chelating column, and the bound proteins were eluted with stepwise increased concentrations of imidazole and EDTA. Eluates were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and then analyzed with silver staining (upper panel) and immunoblotting with anti-c-myc antibody 9B11 antibody (lower panel).

https://openalex.org/W2031981119,"Highly pathogenic influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 proved to be remarkably mobile in migratory bird populations where it has led to extensive outbreaks for which the true number of affected birds usually cannot be determined. For the evaluation of avian influenza monitoring and HPAIV early warning systems, we propose a time-series analysis that includes the estimation of confidence intervals for (i) the prevalence in outbreak situations or (ii) in the apparent absence of disease in time intervals for specified regional units. For the German outbreak regions in 2006 and 2007, the upper 95% confidence limit allowed the detection of prevalences below 1% only for certain time intervals. Although more than 25,000 birds were sampled in Germany per year, the upper 95% confidence limit did not fall below 5% in the outbreak regions for most of the time. The proposed analysis can be used to monitor water bodies and high risk areas, also as part of an early-warning system. Chances for an improved targeting of the monitoring system as part of a risk-based approach are discussed with the perspective of reducing sample sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2023144237,"Previously, we have shown the loss of anti-Bax function in Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD)-associated prion protein (PrP) mutants that are unable to generate cytosolic PrP (CyPrP). To determine if the anti-Bax function of PrP modulates the manifestation of prion diseases, we further investigated the anti-Bax function of eight familial Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker Syndrome (GSS)-associated PrP mutants. These PrP mutants contained their respective methionine (M) or valine (V) at codon 129. All of the mutants lost their ability to prevent Bax-mediated chromatin condensation or DNA fragmentation in primary human neurons. In the breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells, the F198SV, D202NV, P102LV and Q217RV retained, whereas the P102LM, P105LV, Y145stopM and Q212PM PrP mutants lost their ability to inhibit Bax-mediated condensed chromatin. The inhibition of Bax-mediated condensed chromatin depended on the ability of the mutants to generate cytosolic PrP. However, except for the P102LV, none of the mutants significantly inhibited Bax-mediated caspase activation. These results show that the cytosolic PrP generated from the GSS mutants is not as efficient as wild type PrP in inhibiting Bax-mediated cell death. Furthermore, these results indicate that the anti-Bax function is also disrupted in GSS-associated PrP mutants and is not associated with the difference between CJD and GSS."
