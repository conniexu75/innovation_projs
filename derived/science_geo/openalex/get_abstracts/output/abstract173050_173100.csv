https://openalex.org/W2094469836,"The structural basis for the divalent cation–dependent binding of heterodimeric αβ integrins to their ligands, which contain the prototypical Arg-Gly-Asp sequence, is unknown. Interaction with ligands triggers tertiary and quaternary structural rearrangements in integrins that are needed for cell signaling. Here we report the crystal structure of the extracellular segment of integrin αVβ3 in complex with a cyclic peptide presenting the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence. The ligand binds at the major interface between the αV and β3 subunits and makes extensive contacts with both. Both tertiary and quaternary changes are observed in the presence of ligand. The tertiary rearrangements take place in βA, the ligand-binding domain of β3; in the complex, βA acquires two cations, one of which contacts the ligand Asp directly and the other stabilizes the ligand-binding surface. Ligand binding induces small changes in the orientation of αV relative to β3."

We demonstrate that p66shc regulates intracellular oxidant levels in mammalian cells and that hydrogen peroxide can negatively regulate forkhead activity. In p66shc-/- cells, the activity of the mammalian forkhead homolog FKHRL1 is increased and redox-dependent forkhead inactivation is reduced. In addition, expression of FKHRL1 results in an increase in both hydrogen peroxide scavenging and oxidative stress resistance. These results demonstrate an important functional relation between three distinct elements linked to aging: forkhead proteins, p66shc, and intracellular oxidants."
https://openalex.org/W2090135651,"By Fourier's theorem1, signals can be decomposed into a sum of sinusoids of different frequencies. This is especially relevant for hearing, because the inner ear performs a form of mechanical Fourier transform by mapping frequencies along the length of the cochlear partition. An alternative signal decomposition, originated by Hilbert2, is to factor a signal into the product of a slowly varying envelope and a rapidly varying fine time structure. Neurons in the auditory brainstem3,4,5,6 sensitive to these features have been found in mammalian physiological studies. To investigate the relative perceptual importance of envelope and fine structure, we synthesized stimuli that we call ‘auditory chimaeras’, which have the envelope of one sound and the fine structure of another. Here we show that the envelope is most important for speech reception, and the fine structure is most important for pitch perception and sound localization. When the two features are in conflict, the sound of speech is heard at a location determined by the fine structure, but the words are identified according to the envelope. This finding reveals a possible acoustic basis for the hypothesized ‘what’ and ‘where’ pathways in the auditory cortex7,8,9,10."

By using comparative modeling techniques, we were able to derive a model for CotA based on the known x-ray structures of zucchini ascorbate oxidase and Cuprinus cereneus laccase. This model of CotA contains all the structural features of a laccase, including the reactive surface-exposed copper center (T1) and two buried copper centers (T2 and T3). Single amino acid substitutions in the CotA T1 copper center (H497A, or M502L) did not prevent assembly of the mutant proteins into the coat and did not alter the pattern of extractable coat polypeptides. However, in contrast to a wild type strain, both mutants produced unpigmented colonies and spores unable to oxidize syringaldazine (SGZ) and 2′2-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). The CotA protein was purified to homogeneity from an overproducing Escherichia coli strain. The purified CotA shows an absorbance and a EPR spectra typical of blue multicopper oxidases. Optimal enzymatic activity was found at ≤pH 3.0 and at pH 7.0 for ABTS or SGZ oxidation, respectively. The apparent Km values for ABTS and SGZ at 37 °C were of 106 ± 11 and 26 ± 2 μm, respectively, with corresponding kcat values of 16.8 ± 0.8 and 3.7 ± 0.1 s−1. Maximal enzyme activity was observed at 75 °C with ABTS as substrate. Remarkably, the coat-associated or the purified enzyme showed a half-life of inactivation at 80 °C of about 4 and 2 h, respectively, indicating that CotA is intrinsically highly thermostable.

Bacterial endospores are cellular structures designed to resist to a wide range of physical-chemical extremes such as wet and dry heat, desiccation, radiation, UV light, and oxidizing agents, would promptly destroy vegetative cells. The remarkable level of resistance of the bacterial endospore is largely attributed to its unique structural features (1Driks A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Henriques A.O. Moran C.P., Jr. Methods. 2000; 20: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis the dehydrated spore core, which contains a copy of the chromosome, is surrounded by a thick layer of a modified peptidoglycan called the cortex, which is essential for heat resistance. The cortex is protected from the action of lysozyme and harsh chemicals by a multi-layered protein coat, which also influences the spore response to germinants (1Driks A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Henriques A.O. Moran C.P., Jr. Methods. 2000; 20: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis the coat is structurally differentiated into a thin lamellar inner layer closely apposed to the cortex peptidoglycan and a thicker, striated and electron-dense outer layer (1Driks A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Henriques A.O. Moran C.P., Jr. Methods. 2000; 20: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The structure of the coat results from a multistep assembly process that involves the temporally and spatially regulated synthesis of more than 30 different protein components ranging in size from about 6 to 70 kDa (1Driks A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Henriques A.O. Moran C.P., Jr. Methods. 2000; 20: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Stragier P. Losick R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 297-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Their order of assembly and final destination within the coat layers appears to rely on a complex pattern of specific protein-protein interactions as well as on a variety of post-translational modifications, including proteolytic processing, cross-linking, and glycosylation (1Driks A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Henriques A.O. Moran C.P., Jr. Methods. 2000; 20: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Several components of the B. subtilis spore coat are enzymes, with possible roles in the post-translational modifications that accompany the macromolecular assembly of the coat or in the final resistance properties of the spore structure. For example, a manganese-dependent catalase is a component of the inner coat layers (4Henriques A.O. Beall B.W. Roland K. Moran C.P., Jr. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3394-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Seyler R. Henriques A.O. Ozin A. Moran C.P., Jr. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and a transglutaminase associates with the outer coat layers to promote ε-(γ-Glu)Lys cross-linking of specific structural components (6Kobayashi K. Kumazawa Y. Miwa K. Yamanaka S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 144: 157-160Google Scholar, 7Suzuki S. Izawa Y. Kobayashi K. Eto Y. Yamanaka S. Kubota K. Yokozeki K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 2344-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Another enzyme that appears to associate with the outer coat layers is the 65-kDa product of the cotA gene (8Donovan W. Zheng L. Sandman K. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Zheng L. Donovan W.P. Fitz-James P.C. Losick R.

CotA belongs to a diverse group of multi-copper “blue” oxidases that includes the laccases (11Alexandre G. Zhulin I.B. Trends Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 41-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5426-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The absence of CotA has no detectable effect on lysozyme resistance or germination, but it does prevent the appearance of a brown pigment characteristic of colonies in the late stages of sporulation (8Donovan W. Zheng L. Sandman K. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 14Rogolsky M. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 2426-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which appears to protect spores against UV light (13Hullo M.-F. Moszer I. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5426-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) catalyze the oxidation of a variety of aromatic compounds, in particular phenolic substrates, coupled to the reduction of molecular oxygen to water (15Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3105) Google Scholar). Their catalytic centers consist of three structurally and functionally distinct copper centers. T1 copper (“blue copper”), is a mononuclear center involved in substrate oxidation, whereas both T2 and T3 form a trinuclear center involved in the oxygen reduction to water (15Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3105) Google Scholar). Laccases are receiving increased attention as a model system for characterizing the structure-function relationship of copper-containing proteins because of their potential for biotechnological applications in fields such as delignification, plant fiber derivatization, textile dye or stain bleaching, and contaminated water or soil detoxification (16Breen A. Singleton F.L. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These enzymes are widely distributed in plants and fungi, where they have been implicated in melanin formation, lignolysis, and detoxification (17Thurston C.F. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 19-26Crossref Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Several protein sequences with significant similarity to fungal laccases have been predicted in bacterial genomes (11Alexandre G. Zhulin I.B. Trends Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 41-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), but other than in B. subtilis spores (12Henriques A.O. Martins L.O. Soares C.M. Costa T. Pereira M.M. Teixeira M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 86: 259Google Scholar, 13Hullo M.-F. Moszer I. Danchin A. Martin-Verstraete I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5426-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), laccase activity was found in only three other bacterial species, the soil bacterium Azospirillum lipoferum (18Givaudan A. Efosse A. Faure D. Potier P. Bouillant M.-L. Bally R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 108: 205-210Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the marine bacteria Marinomonas mediterranea and strain 2-40 (19Sanchez-Amat A. Solano F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore we overproduced, purified, and characterized biochemically the recombinant enzyme and found spectroscopic and kinetic properties consistent with those reported for fungal laccases. We show that both the spore-associated enzyme or the purified protein are remarkably heat stable. CotA is naturally associated with the coat structure in an active form, and expression of cotA from a multicopy plasmid results in spores with greatly increased levels of CotA. Therefore, we suggest that the B. subtilis endospore coat structure can be used as a surface display system for biocatalyst applications involving the highly stable CotA laccase. The structures of ascorbate oxidase from zucchini (Ref. 22Messerschmidt A. Landenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Avigliano L. Petruzzelli R. Rossi A. Finazzi-Agró A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar; PDB code 1AOZ) and laccase from Coprinus cinereus (Ref. 23Ducros V. Brzozowski A.M. Wilson K.S. Brown S.H. Ostergaard P. Schneider P. Yaver D.S. Pedersen A.H. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar; PDB code 1A65) were used to derive a structural model of CotA by comparative modeling techniques. The program Modeler version 4 (24Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar) was used for this purpose. The ZAO and laccase structures were superimposed to generate a sequence alignment that reflected the equivalence of residues in the structure (that may differ from common sequence alignments). The CotA sequence was then aligned against the primary alignment. Because of the low sequence identity, this alignment had a considerable number of ambiguities, which were taken into account in the final model (see “Results”). The initial alignment of CotA was used to generate structural models that were then checked using two criteria, identification of zones displaying restrain violations using Modeler and checking several stereochemical and conformational criteria using PROCHECK (25Laskowski A. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thorton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The alignment was changed to correct these problems, and a new cycle was started. Several of these cycles were performed to optimize the alignment and the structural models obtained. Forty structural models were generated with the final alignment and the model displaying the lowest value of the objective function was chosen as the final structural model for CotA. The same procedure used for the wild type was implemented to model the structures of the proteins bearing point mutations in the T1 center. The optimized alignment of the wild type was changed in the specified position of the mutation, and the model with the lowest value of the objective function was chosen from 40 generated structural models. Two mutants are described in this work, H497A and M502L, both affecting the type I copper site. For modeling the structure of the M502L mutant, the structure of the T1 center of laccase (with its ligands) was used. The B. subtilis strains used in this study are listed in Table I. They are congenic derivatives of the wild type MB24 strain (Table I). The Escherichia coli strain DH5α (laboratory stock) was used for routine cloning procedures, propagation, and amplification of all plasmid constructs. Overproduction of the CotA protein was performed in E. coli strain Tuner (DE3) (Novagen). The E. coli and B. subtilis strains were routinely grown and maintained in LB medium with appropriate antibiotic selection when needed. Sporulation of B. subtilis was induced by growth and exhaustion in Difco sporulation medium (4Henriques A.O. Beall B.W. Roland K. Moran C.P., Jr. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3394-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whenever required, CuCl2 was added to LB or DSM liquid or solid media, as specified in the text.Table IBacterial strains used in this studyStrain or plasmidGenotype or propertiesReference or sourceE. coli Tuner (DE3)PT7lac promoterNovagen AH3520Tuner (DE3) (pET21a(+))1-aReplicative plasmids are shown in parenthesis.This work AH3517Tuner (DE3) (pLOM10)This workB. subtilis MB24trpC2 metC3/Spo+(wild type)Laboratory stock AH76trpC2 metC3 cotA::cm/CmrLaboratory stock AH3512MB24ΩpLOM8′2/SprThis work AH3513MB24ΩpLOM9/SprThis work AH3514MB24ΩpLOM2/SprThis work AH2734MB24 (pTC66)/SprThis work AH2350MB24 (pMK3)/SprRef. 29Bradford M.M.

The 3′-end of the wild type cotA gene was PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA of strain MB24 (Table I) using primers cotA-1189D (5′-CAGATGCATATATCATGCAATTCAGAGTC-3′) and cotA-1892R (5′-TCATGTAGATCTTGTGTGAGCATAAAAAGCAGCTCC-3′). The resulting 703-bp DNA fragment was purified, digested with NsiI and BglII, and cloned between the same sites in pMS38 2M. Serrano, R. Fior, C. P. Moran, Jr., and A. O. Henriques, unpublished results. to produce pLOM2. Plasmid pLOM2 served as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. Single amino acid substitutions in copper center I (histidine 479 to an alanine, H479A, or of methionine 502 to a leucine, M502L) were created using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). Primers cotA-HAD (5′-GCCATATTCTAGAGGCGGAAGACTATGACATG-3′) and cotA-HAR (5′-CATGTCATAGTCTTCCGCCTCTAGAATATGGC-3′) were used to create the H479A mutation, whereas primers cotA-MLD (5′-GCATGAAGACTATGACCTGATGAGACCGATGG-3′) and cotA-MLR (5′-CCATCGGTCTCATCAGGTCATAGTCTTCATGC-3′) were used to generate the M502L mutation. The presence of the desired mutations in the resulting plasmids, pLOM8 (carrying the H479A allele) and pLOM9 (bearing the M502L mutation), and the absence of unwanted mutations in other regions of the insert or in pLOM2 (wild type cotA sequence) were confirmed by sequencing. Competent cells of B. subtilis MB24 were transformed with plasmids pLOM8, pLOM9, and pLOM2 with selection for chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr). Transformants were expected to arise as the result of a single reciprocal recombination event (Campbell-type mechanism) between the cloned DNA and the corresponding region of homology in the host chromosome (see Fig. 1). For each cross, transformants were identified with the expected structure in the vicinity of the cotA locus, as determined by PCR with appropriate primers. Most of the crossovers were expected to occur upstream of the mutation, because the insert in the plasmid extends by about 500 bp upstream of this position and only some 200 bp downstream of this position (see Fig. 1). Crossovers upstream of the mutation would result in cells expressing only the mutant cotA allele. To establish that the crossover had generated a full-length mutated copy of the cotA gene, the presence of the correct mutations was confirmed by sequencing appropriate PCR fragments derived from the recombinant chromosomes. In addition, the cotA locus in cells resulting from integration of pLOM2 (which carries the wild type sequence) was also sequenced to confirm that no other mutations had been serendipitously introduced into the chromosome. Strains AH3512, AH3513, and AH3514 were the result of the Campbell integration of pLOM2, pLOM8, and pLOM9 into the cotA locus and express the wild type, cotA H479A, or cotA M502L alleles, respectively (Table I). Primers cotA107D (5′-CGGGCTGCAGCACGAAGATTTTTTG-3′) and cotA-1892R (see above) were used to PCR-amplify a 1785-bp fragment extending 55 bp upstream of the cotA transcription initiation (+1) site (27Sandman K. Kroos L. Cutting S. Youngman P. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product encompasses the entire cotA gene including its promoter flanked by engineered PstI and BglII sites (Fig. 1). The PCR product was digested and cloned between the PstI and BamHI sites of plasmid pMK3 (28Sullivan M.A. Yasbin R.E. Young F. Gene. 1984; 29: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), thereby creating the replicative plasmid pTC66. This plasmid was introduced into the wild type strain MB24 by transformation followed by selection for neomycin resistance. This produced strain AH2734, a congenic derivative of MB24 that bears a multicopy allele of the cotA gene (Table I). Mature spores were harvested 24 h after the onset of sporulation and subjected to a step gradient of Renocal-76 (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) for purification (4Henriques A.O. Beall B.W. Roland K. Moran C.P., Jr. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3394-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When specified, spores were harvested after treatment of the cultures with lysozyme (12.5 units/ml for 10 min at 37 °C). Occasionally a drop of chloroform was added to facilitate lysis of the mother cell. The analysis of the coat polypeptide composition in wild type and various mutant spores was done as previously described (4Henriques A.O. Beall B.W. Roland K. Moran C.P., Jr. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3394-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the coat proteins were extracted from 2 A580 units of purified spores by boiling the suspension for 8 min in the presence of 125 mmTris, 4% SDS, 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol at pH 6.8 (4Henriques A.O. Beall B.W. Roland K. Moran C.P., Jr. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3394-3406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracted proteins were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE. The gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, and scanned for analysis. The cotA gene was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides cotA159D (5′-CTATAGTACTAGTTTGGAAAATTTAG-3′) and cotA-1892R (see above). The 1733-bp-long PCR product was digested with BglII and SpeI and inserted between the BamHI and NheI sites of plasmid pET21a(+) (Novagen) to yield pLOM10. Introduction of pLOM10 into the E. coli strain Tuner (DE3) (Novagen) produced strain AH3517 (Table I) in which the CotA protein could be produced under the control of the T7 lac promoter. Strain AH3517 was grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.25 mm CuCl2 at 30 °C. Growth was followed until the midlog phase (A600 = 0.3), at which time 1 mm IPTG was added to the culture medium. Incubation was continued for further 3–4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The cell sediment was suspended in Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.6) containing DNase I (10 μg/ml extract), MgCl2 (5 mm), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM, mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were disrupted in a French pressure cell (at 19,000 p.s.i.) followed by ultracentrifugation (40,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C) to remove cell debris and membranes. The resulting soluble extract was loaded onto an ion exchange SP-Sepharose column (bed volume 25 ml) equilibrated with Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.6). Elution was carried out with a two-step linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 and 0.5–1m) in the same buffer. Fractions containing laccase-like activity were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (cutoff of 30 kDa), and equilibrated to 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). The resulting sample was applied to a MonoS HR5/5 Column (AmershamBiosciences). Elution was carried out with a two-step linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 and 0.5–1 m). The active fractions were pooled and desalted. After boiling for 10 min in loading dye (see also “Results”), a single protein band of 65 kDa was revealed by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). All purification steps were carried out at room temperature in a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Åkta fast protein liquid chromatography, Amersham Biosciences). Laccase activity was routinely assayed at 37 °C using the ABTS or SGZ substrates as follows. (a) The assay mixture contained 1 mm ABTS and 100 mm citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4). Oxidation of ABTS was followed by the absorbance increase at 420 nm (ε = 36,000m −1 cm−1). (b) The assay mixture contained 0.1 mm SGZ (dissolved in ethanol) ABTS and 100 mm citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6). Oxidation of SGZ was followed by the absorbance increase at 525 nm (ε = 65,000 m −1 cm−1). The copper requirement was tested by adding CuCl2 (0–1 mm) to the standard assay mixtures. Enzyme activity measurements were performed either on a Beckman DU©70 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments) or on a Molecular Devices Spectra Max 340 microplate reader with a 96-well plate. All assays were performed in triplicate. Enzyme-specific activity was expressed in nmol or μmol of substrate (ABTS or SGZ) oxidized/min/mg of protein or /A580 of a spore suspension. The protein content was determined by the Bradford assay (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The UV-visible absorption spectrum was obtained at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) using a Shimadzu UV 3100 spectrophotometer. EPR spectra were measured with a Bruker ESP-380 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 continuous-flow helium cryostat. EPR spectra obtained under non-saturating conditions were theoretically simulated using the Aasa and Vänngard approach (30Aasa R. Vänngard V.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). The effect of pH on the activity of the enzyme was determined at 37 °C in 100 mm citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 3.0–7.0) and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0–8.0) for the ABTS or SGZ substrates, respectively. The temperature optimum for the activity was determined at temperatures ranging from 22 to 80 °C by measuring ABTS oxidation. Enzyme thermostability was measured at 80 °C by incubating an appropriate amount of purified enzyme (25 μg) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) or 11 A580units of a spore suspension in water. At appropriate times, samples were withdrawn, cooled, and examined for residual activity using the ABTS oxidation assay at 37 °C (see above). Kinetic parameters for the purified enzyme were determined at 37 °C by using different concentrations of ABTS (10–200 μm) or SGZ (1–100 mm). The reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.1 μg of purified CotA protein, and initial rates were obtained from the linear portion of the progress curve. Kinetic data were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots assuming that simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics were followed. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified recombinant CotA was determined on an Applied Biosystem protein sequencer (Model 477A) at the Instituto de Tecnologia Quı́mica e Biológica microsequencing facility. The copper content of purified recombinant CotA was measured by atomic absorption at the Instituto Superior Técnico (Technical University of Lisbon) chemical analysis facility. The molecular mass of the CotA protein was determined on a gel filtration Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.15 m NaCl. Ribonuclease (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa) were used as standards. The isoelectric point was evaluated in a Phast System (Amersham Biosciences) against broad pI standards following the manufacture's instructions. B. subtilis CotA is significantly similar at the primary structure level with multicopper oxidases, a protein family that includes the laccases (11Alexandre G. Zhulin I.B.

Moreover, CotA shows similarity with the two members of this family whose structure is known, having 19.7% sequence identity and 36.6% similarity with zucchini ascorbate oxidase (22Messerschmidt A.

Ostergaard P. Schneider P. Yaver D.S. Pedersen A.H. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, based on sequence comparisons, C. cinereus laccase and ZAO are more closely related to each other (30.6% identity and 50% similarity) than to CotA. Nevertheless, the comparison of the amino acid sequences between CotA and these members of the multicopper oxidase family showed that the copper ligands are conserved in CotA. Submission of the CotA sequence to GenTHREADER (32Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) revealed, with a confidence level above 99%, both ZAO and laccase as possible folds. Because they rely on various factors beyond sequence similarity, these threading methods reinforced the view that CotA is a member of the multicopper oxidase family. Consequently, the crystal structures of ZAO and laccase from C. cinereus were used to derive a structural model for CotA by comparative modeling techniques. The low overall similarity among CotA, ZAO, and the laccase posed several challenges for deriving its structural model. First,"

The sensation of pain allows us to recognize injury and triggers appropriate protective responses. A specific population of primary afferent neurons called nociceptors are known to be involved in the detection of noxious thermal, mechanical, or chemical stimuli and can be distinguished by their sensitivity to capsaicin, the pungent ingredient in hot chili peppers (1.Fields H.L.

This sensitivity of VR1 to multiple noxious stimuli might explain certain properties of so called polymodal nociceptors. Furthermore, analyses of mice lacking VR1 have shown that VR1 is essential for selective modalities of pain sensation and for tissue injury-induced thermal hyperalgesia, further suggesting a critical role for VR1 in the detection or modulation of pain (10.Caterina M.J.

An important component of this pro-algesic response, adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), has recently been found to potentiate the VR1 currents evoked by capsaicin or protons through metabotropic P2Y1 receptor activation in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway (12.Tominaga M. Wada M. Masu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6951-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In the presence of extracellular ATP, the temperature threshold for VR1 activation was reduced from 42 °C to 35 °C, such that normally nonpainful thermal stimuli (i.e. normal body temperature) were capable of activating VR1 and thereby causing pain. Bradykinin has also been reported to enhance VR1 activity through a PKC-dependent pathway (13.Premkumar L.S. Ahern G.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 14.Vellani V. Mapplebeck S. Moriondo A. Davis J.B. McNaughton P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 813-825Crossref Scopus (449) Google Scholar). These data suggest that direct phosphorylation of VR1 or a closely associated protein by PKC changes the agonist sensitivity of this ion channel. It has to be addressed whether VR1 is directly phosphorylated by PKC and if so which amino acid residues are involved in the phosphorylation. For the purpose, we tried to examine the phosphorylation of VR1 expressed in human embryonic kidney-derived HEK293 cells biochemically and identified two Ser residues in the cytoplasmic domains of VR1, Ser502 and Ser800. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptmycin, andl-glutamine) and plated at 60–70% confluence in 100-mm dishes, then transfected with 1 μg of rat VR1 plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (6.Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar). In vivo phosphorylation was confirmed as described previously (15.Tominaga T. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Barber D.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In brief, after transfection the cells were serum-deprived for 36 h in serum-free medium and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (300 μCi/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C. Following PMA (Sigma) stimulation (50 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in TNE buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 and sonicated for 30 s. Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatants were pre-cleared with protein A and then incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with 1 μg of rabbit anti-rat VR1 antibodies. Anti-rabbit IgG was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide). The gel was exposed for autoradiography. Anti-rat VR1 antibody was made as follows. A peptide encoding the predicted carboxyl terminus of VR1 (EDAEVFKDSMVPGEK) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an amino-terminal cystein and used to immunize rabbits. Fusion proteins comprising GST at the amino terminus in-frame with amino (NH2)-terminal, the first intracellular loop and carboxyl (COOH)-terminal were generated by PCR and standard cloning techniques as described previously (16.Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6185-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The PCR products were subcloned into the pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences). The final constracts were verified by sequencing. GST-VR1 protein was purified according to the manufacturer's manuscript (Amersham Biosciences). For the in vitro kinase assays, each purified fusion protein was incubated with the following reagents: 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.01% Triton-X, 100 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 10 μm ATP, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction, in a 50-μl final volume, was started by adding 0.04 unit of PKCε (Panvera) and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Following the addition on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the gel was exposed for autoradiography. The amount of used GST-VR1 proteins was analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. Point mutations were introduced by using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. All constracts were verified by DNA sequencing. cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were carried out at one or 2 days after transfection of VR1 cDNA to HEK293 cells as described previously (6.Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7144) Google Scholar). Standard bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (adjusted with NaOH). Pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (adjusted with KOH). All patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C) unless otherwise noted. When examining the heat-evoked current responses, bath temperature was increased using a preheated solution with the rate of 1–1.5 °C/s. When the heat-activated currents started to inactivate, the heat solution was changed to a 22 °C one. Chamber temperature was monitored (accuracy ±0.1 °C) with a thermocouple placed within 4 mm of the patch-clamped cell. The solutions containing drugs were applied to the chamber (180 μl) by a gravity at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. To confirm the in vivo phosphorylation of VR1 by PKC, we used HEK293 cells expressing VR1 heterologously. Activation of PKC was achieved by incubating the transfected cells for 10 min with 50 ng/ml PMA, a potent and specific PKC activator. Following the treatment with [γ-32P]ATP, the cells were stimulated with PMA. VR1 protein immunoprecipitated with anti-rat VR1 antibody showed more32P incorporation into VR1 upon PMA stimulation compared with the VR1 without PMA stimulation (Fig. 1A), indicating the direct phosphorylation of VR1 by PKC. There are 16 putative Ser or Thr residues that are candidate substrates for PKC-dependent phosphorylation in the VR1 NH2 terminus, first intracellular loop, and COOH terminus (Fig. 1B). To distinguish among these possibilities, recombinant proteins carrying GST fused to the three segments of the cytoplasmic domains of VR1 were generated for use in an in vitro kinase assay. This assay demonstrated that the first intracellular loop and the COOH-terminal contained the substrates for PKCε (Fig. 1C, panel b). To identify the specific VR1 amino acids involved, eight Ser or Thr residues in the first intracellular loop and the COOH-terminal were individually replaced with Ala, and the resulting mutant proteins were subjected to functional analysis using a whole-cell patch clamp technique. In voltage clamp experiments, a low dose of capsaicin (20 nm) evoked small inward currents in the HEK293 cells expressing VR1. In the absence of extracellular calcium, no change was observed in the magnitude of responses evoked by repetitive capsaicin applications. In contrast, after a 1-min pretreatment with 100 nm PMA, the same dose of capsaicin produced a much larger current responses (7.95 ± 2.72 (means ± S.E.)-fold,n = 8) (Fig. 2A). Other electrophysiological properties of these capsaicin-evoked responses were unchanged by the presence of PMA (data not shown). Among the mutants tested, S502A and S800A showed significantly smaller potentiation of capsaicin-evoked current responses by PMA, although normalized currents after treatment of PMA varied in the eight mutants (2.13 ± 0.41-fold, n = 9 for S502A; 2.76 ± 0.52-fold, n = 11 for S800A) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, B, C, and E). In wild type VR1, PKC activation works by increasing the potency of capsaicin but not its efficacy (12.Tominaga M. Wada M. Masu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6951-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Therefore, we ruled out the possibility that the two mutants, S502A and S800A, already have a high affinity for capsaicin by examining that higher doses of capsaicin produced bigger current responses in the two mutants like wild type (data not shown). Patch clamp recordings in mutants bearing Ala substitutions of eight other Ser and Thr residues in the NH2 terminus of VR1 provided no evidence for the involvement of these residues in PMA-mediated potentiation (9.18 ± 4.05-fold, n = 7; 14.7 ± 4.58-fold, n = 9; 10.4 ± 4.26-fold, n = 5; 7.20 ± 1.50-fold,n = 6; 9.85 ± 2.37-fold, n = 5; 7.32 ± 3.77-fold, n = 5; 14.6 ± 5.39-fold,n = 6 and 20.4 ± 7.46-fold, n = 9 for T42A, S93A, S139A, S153A, S185A, T322A, T329A, and S366A, respectively). Furthermore, double mutant S502A/S800A exhibited almost no PMA potentiation effect (0.95 ± 0.04-fold, n = 7) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting that these two Ser residues were the major substrates for PKC-dependent phosphorylation. Because ATP is a more physiological stimulus leading to PKC activation and because PMA has been reported to have some direct effects on VR1 (17.Chuang H.-H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.E. Basbaum A.I. Chao M.V. Julius D. Nature. 2001; 411: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), ATP was applied to cells expressing wild type, single (S502A and S800A) or double (S502A/S800A) VR1 mutants to confirm the involvement of these two Ser residues in VR1 potentiation. All of the S502A, S800A, and S502A/S800A mutants again showed no potentiation of VR1 currents evoked by 20 nm capsaicin upon pretreatment of 100 μm ATP, whereas capsaicin-evoked currents were significantly potentiated by ATP in wild type VR1 (2.61 ± 0.19-fold, n = 7 for wild type; 1.05 ± 0.24-fold, n = 7 for S502A; 0.63 ± 0.10-fold, n = 6 for S800A; 0.79 ± 0.12-fold, n = 7 for S502A/S800A) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3), indicating that these two Ser residues were phosphorylated in the physiological condition.Figure 3Two Ser residues are involved in phosphorylation of VR1 by ATPε.

Therefore, potentiating effects of PMA were examined on heat-evoked responses in HEK293 cells expressing wild type VR1 or S502A/S800A mutant. For this analysis, heat-evoked current responses were compared between different cells, rather than within the same cell, because repetitive heat-evoked currents show significant desensitization even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+(7.Tominaga M.

Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). When temperature ramps were applied to HEK293 cells expressing wild type VR1, heat-evoked currents developed at about 42 °C with an extremely steep temperature dependence (Fig. 4A). PMA (100 nm) treatment lowered the temperature threshold for wild type VR1 activation significantly (41.9 ± 0.9 °C, n = 3 and 31.8 ± 1.6 °C, n = 4, without and with PMA treatment, respectively, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4,A and C). On the other hand, HEK293 cells expressing the S502A/S800A mutant showed a little lower temperature threshold for activation without PMA treatment, although there was no significant difference between wild type and S502A/S800A mutant. However, no reduction of the threshold was observed in the mutant upon PMA treatment (38.0 ± 1.4 °C, n = 7 and 37.4 ± 0.7 °C, n = 9 without and with PMA treatment, respectively, p = 0.7). These data further indicate the involvement of these two Ser residues in VR1 sensitization. To further confirm that Ser502 and Ser800function as substrates for PKCε-dependent phosphorylation, an in vitro kinase assay was carried out in those mutants. Phosphorylation was significantly reduced in both S502A and S800A mutants upon PKCε application when the same amount of proteins were loaded (Fig. 1C, panels a andb). Some residual signals in both S502A and S800A mutants might suggest phosphorylation of other amino acids in the fusion proteins by PKCε. However, it is not likely that the phosphorylation in the mutants has significant meaning in terms of potentiation of VR1 currents by PKC, since the double mutant, S502A/S800A, showed no potentiation of VR1 currents evoked by capsaicin upon both PMA and ATP stimuli (Figs. 2 and 3) and no reduction of temperature threshold for activation upon PMA stimulus (Fig. 4). One of the mechanisms underlying inflammatory pain is sensitization of ion channels expressed in nociceptor terminals such as VR1 (1.Fields H.L. Pain.

Sensitization is triggered by extracellular inflammatory mediators, including ATP and bradykinin, released from surrounding damaged, inflamed, or ischemic tissues and from nociceptors themselves. Our data and those of others suggest that a system consisting of VR1 and certain metabotropic receptors exists that causes nociceptor sensitization by increasing VR1 sensitivity to noxious stimuli (12.Tominaga M.

PKCε, among many PKC isoforms, has been reported to be predominantly and specifically involved in nociceptor sensitization (21.Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A. Parker P.J. McNaughton P.A.

In the present study, directin vivo phosphorylation of VR1 by PKC was proven for the first time, and PKCε was found to phosphorylate two Ser residues. The replacement of these residues with Ala results in blunting of PKCε-mediated VR1 phosphorylation and a complete loss of VR1 potentiation or sensitization by ATP or PMA. Another isoform of PKC, PKCγ, has been shown to be pivotal for enhancing the sensation of pain in the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons (24.Malmberg A.B. Chen C. Tonegawa S. Basbaum A.I. Science. 1997; 278: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 25.Martin W.J. Malmberg A.B. Basbaum A.I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5321-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, two different isoforms of PKC, PKCε and PKCγ, exhibit distinct roles at two levels of the pain pathway: the primary afferent neuron and the spinal cord dorsal horn, respectively. Our findings suggest that inhibitors of PKC (especially PKCε) as well as compounds acting at Ser502 or Ser800 of VR1 could prove useful in the treatment of pain by interfering with phosphorylation-mediated sensitization events.

Here we show that increased dosage of NPT1, encoding a nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase critical for the NAD+ salvage pathway, increases Sir2-dependent silencing, stabilizes the rDNA locus, and extends yeast replicative life span by up to 60%. Both NPT1 and SIR2 provide resistance against heat shock, demonstrating that these genes act in a more general manner to promote cell survival. We show that Npt1 and a previously uncharacterized salvage pathway enzyme, Nma2, are both concentrated in the nucleus, indicating that a significant amount of NAD+ is regenerated in this organelle. Additional copies of the salvage pathway genes, PNC1, NMA1, and NMA2, increase telomeric and rDNA silencing, implying that multiple steps affect the rate of the pathway. Although SIR2-dependent processes are enhanced by additional NPT1, steady-state NAD+ levels and NAD+/NADH ratios remain unaltered. This finding suggests that yeast life span extension may be facilitated by an increase in the availability of NAD+ to Sir2, although not through a simple increase in steady-state levels.

In contrast, genetic studies in model organisms have demonstrated that relatively minor changes to an organism's environment or genetic makeup can dramatically slow the aging process. For example, the life span of many diverse organisms can be greatly extended simply by limiting calorie intake, in a dietary regime known as caloric restriction (1Masoro E.J. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 2Vanfleteren J.R. Braeckman B.P. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3Zainal T.A.

How can simple changes have such profound effects on a complex process such as aging? A picture is emerging in which all eukaryotes possess a surprisingly conserved regulatory system that governs the pace of aging (4Kenyon C. Cell. 2001; 105: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 5Guarente L. Kenyon C. Nature. 2000; 408: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Such a regulatory system may have arisen in evolution to allow organisms to survive in adverse conditions by redirecting resources from growth and reproduction to pathways that provide stress resistance (4Kenyon C. Cell. 2001; 105: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 6Kirkwood T.B. Rose M.R. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 332: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). One model that has proven particularly useful in the identification of regulatory factors of aging is the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Replicative life span in S. cerevisiae is typically defined as the number of buds or “daughter cells” produced by an individual “mother cell” (7Barton A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1950; 4: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mother cells undergo age-dependent changes, including an increase in size, a slowing of the cell cycle, enlargement of the nucleolus, an increase in steady-state NAD+ levels, increased gluconeogenesis and energy storage, and sterility resulting from the loss of silencing at telomeres and mating-type loci (8Sinclair D.A.

An alternative measure of yeast life span, known as chronological aging, is the length of time a population of non-dividing cells remains viable when deprived of nutrients (14Longo V.D. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Increased chronological life span correlates with increased resistance to heat shock and oxidative stress, suggesting that cumulative damage to cellular components is a major cause of this type of aging (14Longo V.D. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Jazwinski S.M. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2001; 122: 865-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The extent of overlap between replicative and chronological aging is currently unclear. One cause of yeast replicative aging has been shown to stem from the instability of the repeated ribosomal DNA (rDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: rDNAribosomal DNANaMNnicotinic acid mononucleotideNaADdesamido-NAD+NaMnicotinamideNaMNATnicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferaseORFopen reading frameGFPgreen fluorescence proteinHAhemagglutininSCsynthetic completeMMSmethylmethane sulfonate3xHAtriple hemagglutinin epitope 1The abbreviations used are: rDNAribosomal DNANaMNnicotinic acid mononucleotideNaADdesamido-NAD+NaMnicotinamideNaMNATnicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferaseORFopen reading frameGFPgreen fluorescence proteinHAhemagglutininSCsynthetic completeMMSmethylmethane sulfonate3xHAtriple hemagglutinin epitope locus (16Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). This instability gives rise to circular forms of rDNA called extrachromosomal rDNA circles that replicate but fail to segregate to daughter cells. Eventually, extrachromosomal rDNA circles accumulate to over 1000 copies, which are thought to kill cells by titrating essential transcription and/or replication factors (16Sinclair D.A. Guarente L.

Sir2 is a component of the heterotrimeric Sir2/3/4 complex that catalyzes the formation of silent heterochromatin at telomeres and the two silent mating-type loci (25Laurenson P. Rine J. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 543-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sir2 is also a component of the regulator of nucleolar silencing and telophase exit complex that is required for silencing at the rDNA locus and exit from telophase (26Straight A.F. Shou W. Dowd G.J.

This complex has also recently been shown to directly stimulate transcription of rRNA by polymerase I and to be involved in the regulation of nucleolar structure (28Shou W. Sakamoto K.M. Keener J.

Cell. 2001; 8: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that Sir2 can readily deacetylate the amino-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4, resulting in the formation of O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide (21Tanner K.G.

A. 2001; 98: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Strains with additional copies of SIR2 display increased rDNA silencing (30Smith J.S. Caputo E. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3184-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and a 30% longer life span (17Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that additional copies of the Caenorhabditis elegans SIR2 homolog, sir-2.1, greatly extend life span in that organism (31Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). This implies that the SIR2-dependent regulatory pathway for aging arose early in evolution and has been well conserved (4Kenyon C. Cell. 2001; 105: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Yeast life span, like that of metazoans, is also extended by interventions that resemble caloric restriction (19Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 32Jiang J.C. Jaruga E. Repnevskaya M.V. Jazwinski S.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2135-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Mutations that reduce the activity of the glucose-responsive cAMP (adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate)-dependent (protein kinase A) pathway extend life span in wild type cells but not in mutant sir2 strains, demonstrating that SIR2 is a key downstream component of the caloric restriction pathway (19Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). In bacteria, NAD+ is synthesized de novo from tryptophan and recycled in four steps from nicotinamide via the NAD+ salvage pathway (see Fig. 5 below). The first step in the bacterial NAD+ salvage pathway, the hydrolysis of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid and ammonia, is catalyzed by the pncA gene product (33Foster J.W. Kinney D.M. Moat A.G. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An S. cerevisiae gene with homology to pncA, YGL037, was recently assigned the name PNC1 (34Ghislain M. Talla E. Francois J.M. Yeast. 2002; 19: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, encoded by the NPT1 gene in S. cerevisiae, converts the nicotinic acid from this reaction to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) (35Wubbolts M.G. Terpstra P. van Beilen J.B. Kingma J. Meesters H.A. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17665-17672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Vinitsky A. Teng H. Grubmeyer C.T. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 28-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At this point, the NAD+ salvage pathway and the de novoNAD+ pathway converge and NaMN is converted to desamido-NAD+ (NaAD) by a nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NaMNAT). In S. cerevisiae, there are two putative ORFs with homology to bacterial NaMNAT genes,YLR328 (39Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Lorenzi M. Raffaelli N. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and an uncharacterized ORF, YGR010(23Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 39Emanuelli M. Carnevali F. Lorenzi M. Raffaelli N. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We refer to these two ORFs as NMA1 and NMA2, respectively. In Salmonella, the final step in the regeneration of NAD+ is catalyzed by an NAD synthetase (40Hughes K.T. Olivera B.M. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2113-2120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An as yet uncharacterized ORF, QNS1, is predicted to encode an NAD synthetase (23Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In yeast, null mutations in NPT1 reduce steady-state NAD+ levels by ∼2-fold (23Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S. Starai V.J. Avalos J.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Grubmeyer C. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6658-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and abolish the longevity provided by limiting calories (19Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). One current hypothesis explaining how caloric restriction extends replicative life span is that decreased metabolic activity causes an increase in NAD+ levels, which then stimulate Sir2 activity (reviewed in Campisi (68Campisi J. Science. 2000; 289: 2062-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Guarente (69Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In this study, we tested this theory by examining whether additional copies of NPT1 can promote Sir2-dependent life span extension and whether this correlates with increased NAD+ levels. We show that additional NPT1 extends replicative life span in a SIR2-dependent manner via the caloric restriction pathway. We find that these long-lived strains do not have increased NAD+ levels or altered NAD+/NADH ratios, despite the fact that every SIR2-dependent process we examined was enhanced. Interestingly, increased dosage of SIR2 or NPT1 provides resistance to heat shock, indicating that these genes act in a general manner to promote cell survival. We find that additional copies of all the salvage pathway genes increase rDNA and telomeric silencing with exception of QNS1. We show that Npt1 and Nma2 are concentrated in the nucleus, raising the possibility that a substantial fraction of NAD+ is recycled within this organelle. We discuss the potential for extending life span in higher organisms by stimulation of the conserved NAD+ salvage pathway. Strains used in this study are listed in Table II (see below).

Integrants were first identified by PCR. The NPT1 copy-number was then determined by probing for NPT1 and ACT1 DNA on Southern blots. The density of the NPT1 band was compared with an ACT1 band using ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Strains carrying an additional copy of SIR2 were generated by integrating plasmids p306SIR2 or p305SIR2 (17Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L.

YDS1595 was generated from W303AR5 by selecting a colony that had experienced an ADE2 loss event. YDS1595 was transformed with StuI-cut pRS402 (carrying the ADE2 gene) to create YDS1596.

The NPT1 deletion strain, YDS1580, was generated by replacing the wild type gene with the kanr marker as described previously (46Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H.

The coding region of NMA1/YLR328 and 450 bp upstream were amplified from genomic template by PCR, and the 2150-bp fragment was cloned into pRS306 to generate p306YLR328. The coding region and 600 bp upstream of QNS1/YHR074 were amplified by PCR, and the 2.8-kb SacI/NotI fragment was cloned into pSP400 to make pSPYHR074. Additional copies of PNC1/YGL037, NMA1/YLR328, NMA2/YGR010, and QNS1/YHR074 were integrated at the URA3 locus of W303AR5 and PSY316AT by transformation. All amplified DNA was confirmed to be free of mutations by sequencing. HA-tagged NPT1 was generated using a tag-kanr integration method (47De Antoni A. Gallwitz D. Gene. 2000; 246: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in strains W303AR5 and W303cdc25-10 (19Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). A green fluorescence protein (GFP) cassette was introduced at the carboxyl terminus of Npt1, Nma1, and Nma2 as described previously (48Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). The functionality of tagged proteins was confirmed by assaying rDNA silencing. Replicative life span determination was performed as described (16Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose w/v) unless otherwise stated with a minimum of 40 cells per experiment. Each experiment was performed at least twice independently. Statistical significance of life span differences was determined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Differences are stated to be different when the confidence is higher than 95%. Northern and Western blots were performed using standard techniques. NPT1 transcripts were detected using a probe derived from the complete open reading frame of the NPT1 gene. ACT1 mRNA was detected using a full-length ACT1 probe (gift of G. Fink, M. I. T.). The HA epitope tag was detected using monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Covance Research Products, Richmond, CA). Actin was detected with monoclonal antibody MAB1501R (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C unless otherwise stated. The extent of silencing at the ribosomal DNA locus was determined using two assays. For the ADE2 silencing assay, cells were pre-grown on synthetic complete (SC) medium (1.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, 40 mg/liter each of histidine, uridine, tryptophan, adenine, and leucine) for 3 days. Cells were resuspended in SC medium and serially diluted 10-fold in phosphate-buffered saline and spotted onto SC medium lacking adenine. MET15 silencing assays were performed on Pb2+-containing plates as previously described (42Smith J.S. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Telomeric silencing was assayed on SC medium containing 0.7 mg/liter adenine. Cells were grown for 3 days and placed at 4 °C for 3 days to enhance color. Heat shock assays were performed essentially as described (14Longo V.D. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Strains were pre-grown overnight in SC-complete medium with limiting histidine (20 mg/ml), diluted to 1 × 105 cells/ml in 3 ml of the same medium and grown for 5 days. Cultures were diluted 10-fold in expired medium, incubated for 1 h at 55 °C, and spotted on SC plates. Ribosomal DNA recombination rates were determined as previously described (49Keil R.L. McWilliams A.D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 711-718Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least 10,000 colonies were examined for each strain and each experiment was performed in triplicate. NAD+ and NADH determinations were measured as described elsewhere (50Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). Cells expressing a GFP fusions were grown to mid log phase in YPD medium or YPD low glucose (0.5% w/v) then incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μm Hoechst 33342 DNA stain (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 5 min. Images were captured at 100× magnification on a Nikon E600 fluorescence microscope and analyzed using Photoshop 6.0 software. SIR2 is a limiting component of longevity in yeast and requires NAD+ for catalysis. Studies in Escherichia coli have shown that PncB catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the salvage pathway that recycles NAD+ (35Wubbolts M.G. Terpstra P. van Beilen J.B. Kingma J. Meesters H.A. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17665-17672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Imsande J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 85: 255-273PubMed Google Scholar, 38Grubmeyer C.T. Gross J.W. Rajavel M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 28-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We asked whether additional copies of the yeast pncB homolog, NPT1, could increase NAD+ production to Sir2 and hence extend yeast life span.NPT1 was integrated at the URA3 locus under the control of its native promoter. Strains that carried one or four tandem copies of NPT1 were then identified by Southern blotting. We refer to the resulting genotypes as 2x NPT1 and 5x NPT1, respectively. For the replicative life span assay, cells were grown for at least 2 days on fresh yeast extract/peptone/glucose (YPD) medium to ensure that they had fully recovered from conditions of caloric restriction prior to the assay. Daughter cells that emerged from previously non-budded mother cells were then micro-manipulated away and scored. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the 2x NPT1 strain lived an average of ∼40% longer than the wild type strain and the 5x NPT1 strain lived a striking ∼60% longer. The NPT1-induced life span extension was completely abrogated by a sir2 deletion and not significantly enhanced by an additional copy of SIR2 (Fig. 1 B) indicating that the life span extension provided by NPT1 is mediated by Sir2. It has recently been shown that wild type cells grown in low glucose medium (0.5% w/v) have an average life span significantly greater than those grown on standard (2%) glucose medium (19Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 32Jiang J.C. Jaruga E. Repnevskaya M.V. Jazwinski S.M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2135-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, on low glucose medium the life span of the 5x NPT1 strain was not significantly greater than the wild type strain. The fact that the effect of NPT1 and low glucose were not additive suggests that these two regimens act via the same pathway. Biochemical studies have shown that Sir2 requires NAD+ as a cofactor. This has led to the hypothesis that replicative life span may be extended by increased NAD+ levels. Consistent with this idea, NAD+ levels have been shown to increase significantly in old cells, perhaps as a defense against aging or as the result of decreased metabolic activity (50Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the intracellular levels of NAD+ in any long-lived strain have not been reported. We found that steady-state NAD+ levels and NAD+/NADH ratios in the 2x NPT1 strain were not significantly different from the wild type (Table I). We also examined sir2 and 2x NPT1 sir2 strains and again found no difference from wild type, indicating that the failure to detect increased NAD+levels was not due to the activity of Sir2.Table ISteady-state NAD+ and NADH levels in various long- and short-lived strainsGenotypeNAD+NADHNAD+/NADH, ratioATPamol/pg protein1-aAverage of five independent experiments (S.E.).amol/pg protein1-aAverage of five independent experiments (S.E.).1x NPT1 (wild type)23.7 (3.2)9.3 (0.8)2.8 (0.5)15.5 (3)2x NPT121.9 (2.0)6.0 (0.6)3.3 (0.3)7.6 (1.6)2x NPT1 sir2∷TRP122.5 (1.6)7.0 (0.3)2.4 (0.9)5.3 (1.1)sir2∷TRP123.6 (1.2)7.0 (0.6)2.8 (1.2)7.9 (1.9)1-a Average of five independent experiments (S.E.).

Phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody (anti-Ser(P)2448) and with mTAb1, an activating antibody whose binding is inhibited by phosphorylation in the region of mTOR that contains Ser2448. Incubating rat diaphragm muscles with insulin increased Ser2448 phosphorylation but did not change the total amount of mTOR. Insulin, but not amino acids, activated PKB, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of both Ser308 and Thr473 in the kinase. Ser2448 phosphorylation was also modulated by muscle-loading. Overloading the rat plantaris muscle by synergist muscle ablation, which promotes hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle, increased Ser2448 phosphorylation. In contrast, unloading the gastrocnemius muscle by hindlimb suspension, which promotes atrophy of the muscle, decreased Ser2448phosphorylation, an effect that was fully reversible. Neither overloading nor hindlimb suspension significantly changed the total amount of mTOR. In summary, our results demonstrate that atrophy and hypertrophy of skeletal muscle are associated with decreases and increases in Ser2448 phosphorylation, suggesting that modulation of this site may have an important role in the control of protein synthesis.

Although a net accumulation of protein cannot occur without an adequate supply of the precursor amino acids, certain amino acids exert a control on the rate of protein synthesis through a more specific mechanism. Branched chain amino acids, leucine in particular, stimulate protein synthesis by activating a nutrient-sensing pathway (4Shah O.J. Anthony J.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E715-E729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing the load on a muscle promotes hypertrophy (10Roy R.R. Talmadge R.J. Fox K. Lee M. Ishihara A. Edgerton V.R. J. Appl.

The stimulatory effects on mRNA translation are mediated in part by the phosphorylation of the mRNA translational regulators, PHAS-I and p70S6K (4Shah O.J. Anthony J.C. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S.

Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). mTOR functions as a growth factor and nutrient-sensing signaling molecule in mammalian cells. Defining the role of mTOR has been greatly facilitated by a highly specific inhibitor, rapamycin. To inhibit mTOR rapamycin requires as a partner the FK506-binding protein, FKBP12, because it is only when complexed with FKBP12 that rapamycin is able to bind mTOR with high affinity (15Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). This high affinity interaction has been exploited to purify mTOR from mammalian tissues and cell lines (see for examples Refs. 16Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar and 17Sabers C.J. Martin M.M. Brunn G.J. Williams J.M. Dumont F.J. Wiederrecht G. Abraham R.T. J. Biol.

The effects of both insulin and amino acids on increasing the phosphorylation of PHAS-I and p70S6K in skeletal muscle are attenuated by rapamycin (18Azpiazu I. Saltiel A.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5033-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recently, rapamycin was shown to block both the compensatory hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle resulting from synergist ablation in vivo and the increase in muscle mass associated with recovery from disuse atrophy (2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). These findings with rapamycin have implicated mTOR in the control of skeletal muscle mass by muscle loading. The mechanisms through which mTOR signals and how mTOR activity is controlled are unclear. mTOR is able to phosphorylate both PHAS-I and p70S6K in vitro (16Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 95: 1432-1437Crossref Scopus (932) Google Scholar), although it is still not certain whether mTOR phosphorylates these proteins in cells. There is evidence that mTOR is controlled by PKB, which is activated in response to phospholipid products of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase reaction. PKB is able to phosphorylate Ser2448 in mTOR in vitro (20Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T.

Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T.

A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this region of mTOR was first detected using the antibody, mTAb1, whose reactivity with mTOR was decreased in response to phosphorylation (22Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.R. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Subsequently, phosphorylation of Ser2448 was confirmed by using phosphospecific antibodies to this site (20Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is other evidence that the region surrounding Ser2448 is an important regulatory domain in mTOR. Binding of the antibody, mTAb1, to this region markedly increases the protein kinase activity of mTOR in vitro (21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar, 22Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.R. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Also, recombinant mTOR in which the region containing the mTAb1 epitope has been deleted exhibits increased activity, both in vivo and in vitro (21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Ser2448 may be important in controlling mTOR. Therefore, we conducted experiments to determine whether treatments known to modulate skeletal muscle mass affect the phosphorylation of Ser2448. All incubations were performed at 37 °C in medium continuously bubbled with a 19:1 mixture of O2/CO2 essentially as described previously (18Azpiazu I. Saltiel A.R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5033-5039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼150 g) were sacrificed by decapitation, and diaphragm muscles were excised and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (30 ml/muscle) for 45 min to remove endogenous hormones. The muscles were then incubated with or without insulin (250 milliunits/ml) and/or a 2.5× mixture of minimal essential medium amino acids in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm potassium phosphate, and 25 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm glucose. After 20 min the muscles were blotted on filter paper and immediately frozen in liquid N2. The procedures for loading plantaris muscles by synergist ablation and unloading gastrocnemius muscles by hindlimb suspension were conducted exactly as described previously (2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats (Sprague-Dawley, ∼250 g) were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (50:10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). For synergist ablation, the soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles were removed bilaterally using aseptic surgical techniques (2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). This produces a functional overload on the plantaris muscles (10Roy R.R. Talmadge R.J. Fox K. Lee M. Ishihara A. Edgerton V.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 83: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For hindlimb suspension studies, anesthetized animals were fitted with a tail-traction bandage. Following recovery from the anesthetic, a swivel hook was placed through the bandage and raised so that the hindlimbs were suspended just off the cage floor (11Thomason D.B. Herrick R.E. Surdyka D. Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1987; 63: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). At the appropriate time after surgery, the rats were sacrificed, and the plantaris muscles or gastrocnemius muscles were removed, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Muscles from weight-matched surgically untreated rats served as controls. Crude extracts of skeletal muscle contain large amounts of myosin heavy chain, which comigrates with mTOR and prevents detection of mTOR by immunoblotting. Therefore, mTOR was affinity-purified prior to electrophoresis. The frozen muscles were manually ground with a porcelain mortar and pestle chilled in liquid N2. Powdered tissue was homogenized on ice using a motor-driven tissue grinder (Teflon-glass) in 3 ml of homogenization buffer, which was composed of Buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.25% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 500 nm microcystin-LR, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin-A. The homogenates were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 8,900 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). To purify mTOR, 100 μg of a recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) FKBP12 fusion protein (GST-FKBP12), prepared as previously described (16Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. J.

The beads were then washed three times with homogenization buffer (1 ml/wash) and incubated with 1 ml of muscle extract (1 mg of protein) plus 10 μmrapamycin (Calbiochem) or where indicated, 10 μm FK506 (Fujisawa Pharmaceuticals). After 90 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with Buffer A, twice with Buffer A plus 500 mmNaCl, and then twice in Buffer A. The mTOR antibodies mTAb1 and mTAb2, are the same as used in previous studies (16Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and were generated by immunizing rabbits with peptides having sequences corresponding to residues 2433–2450 and 1272–1290, respectively, in mTOR. Antibodies to the β-isoform of PKB were from Upstate Biotechnology. Phosphospecific antibodies to the Ser308 and Thr473 sites in PKB were from New England Biolabs. To generate phosphospecific antibody to the Ser2448 site in mTOR, essentially the same procedures were used as described previously for the preparation of phosphospecific antibodies to sites in PHAS-I (23Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) except that different peptides were used. Briefly, rabbits were immunized with a phosphopeptide (CTRTDS*YSAGQS, where S* is phosphoserine) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. After the second booster injection, serum was collected and incubated with an affinity resin prepared by coupling a nonphosphorylated peptide to Sulfo-Link beads (Pierce). The unbound fraction was then incubated with a phosphopeptide resin. After exhaustively washing the resin, the anti-Ser(P)2448 antibodies were eluted with 0.3m glycine/HCl (pH 2.7), neutralized, and further purified with protein A-Sepharose. Samples of affinity-purified mTOR were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gel) (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon membranes and immunoblotted with mTOR and PKB antibodies as described previously (16Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,22Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.R. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). After washing the membranes, the light generated by the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and Tropix reagent was detected using x-ray film (Kodak XAR-5). Relative signal intensities of the mTOR bands were determined using a scanning laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). To assess mTOR phosphorylation relative to total mTOR, immunoblots prepared with anti-Ser(P)2448 or mTAb1 were stripped and reprobed with mTAb2, whose binding is not affected by phosphorylation of Ser2448. After correcting for the total amount of mTOR present, the statistical significance of differences among groups was assessed by analysis of variance and the Fisher least significant difference post-hoc test (25Steel R.G.D. Torrie J.H. Principles and Procedures of Statistics: A Biometrical Approach. 2nd Ed. McGraw Hill Publishing Company, New York1980: 172-176Google Scholar). An α level of p < 0.05 was accepted for statistical significance. mTOR was affinity-purified from skeletal muscle extracts by using GST-FKBP12/rapamycin resin (16Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17Sabers C.J. Martin M.M. Brunn G.J. Williams J.M. Dumont F.J. Wiederrecht G. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 815-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) before immunoblots were prepared. mTOR appeared as a single band when immunoblotted with mTAb2 (Fig. 1, lane 1). The FKBP12/FK506 complex does not bind to mTOR (15Abraham R.T. Wiederrecht G.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 483-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Therefore, as a control, the affinity purification procedure was conducted in an identical manner except that FK506 was substituted for rapamycin. As expected, no mTOR was detected in the sample generated with FK506 (Fig. 1, lane 2). Because insulin and amino acids were known to modulate downstream effectors in the mTOR pathway, we conducted experiments to determine whether incubating muscles with these agents affected the phosphorylation of Ser2448 in mTOR. We chose to use hemidiaphragms for these experiments because these muscles may be maintained in a viable, insulin-responsive state during short term incubations in vitro. Phosphorylation of Ser2448was assessed by immunoblotting with the phosphospecific antibody, anti-Ser(P)2448. mTOR that had been affinity-purified from control cells was readily detected with the anti-Ser(P)2448antibody, indicating that this site contained some phosphate even in the basal state (Fig. 2 A). Incubating muscles with either a mixture of amino acids 2Although the amino acid and control values were judged to be not significantly different by an analysis of variance test, p was less than 0.05 by Student's t test. or insulin increased Ser2448 phosphorylation by ∼1.5- or 2-fold, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The combination of insulin plus amino acids was no more effective in increasing Ser2448 phosphorylation than insulin alone. Immunoblots were also prepared with mTAb1, whose binding is decreased by phosphorylation of one or more sites in the regulatory region surrounding Ser2448. Insulin plus amino acids decreased the mTAb1 signal by ∼40% (Fig. 2 C). Although the results were somewhat more variable than that observed with the anti-Ser(P)2448 antibody, the findings with mTAb1 provide independent confirmation that the phosphorylation of mTOR was increased by insulin. To determine whether the treatments affected the total amount of mTOR present, the blots were stripped and reprobed with mTAb2, whose binding is not affected by phosphorylation of Ser2448. The reactivity of mTOR with mTAb2 was not significantly changed by insulin or amino acids (Fig. 2 D). Because PKB has been shown to phosphorylate mTOR on Ser2448 in vitro (20Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the abilities of insulin and amino acids to activate this kinase. This was accomplished by using phosphospecific antibodies to assess changes in the phosphorylation of Ser308 and Thr473. These two sites become phosphorylated when PKB binds phospholipid products of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase reaction, and phosphorylation of both is required for full activation of the kinase (26Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell F.B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). Insulin markedly increased the phosphorylation of both Ser308 and Thr473 (Fig. 3). In contrast, amino acids, either alone or in combination with insulin, had little if any effect on PKB phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Recent findings have implicated mTOR in the control of muscle fiber size in response to changes in load (2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conducted experiments to investigate the effect of loading on the phosphorylation of mTOR. In the first series of experiments, we investigated the phosphorylation of Ser2448in a synergist ablation model of compensatory hypertrophy. In this model, the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles are surgically removed. This results in overloading of the plantaris muscle, which undergoes compensatory hypertrophy (10Roy R.R. Talmadge R.J. Fox K. Lee M. Ishihara A. Edgerton V.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 83: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Noble E.G. Tang Q. Taylor P.B. Can. J. Physiol. Pharm. 1984; 62: 1178-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of the present experiments, the weight of the plantaris muscle was increased by 40% (2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4 A, samples of plantaris muscles from control animals and samples obtained 2 weeks following synergist ablation were immunoblotted with mTOR antibodies. Immunoreactivity with the phosphospecific antibody to Ser(P)2448 was increased more than 2-fold by overloading the muscle (Fig. 4 B). A reciprocal change was observed in the mTAb1 signal, although the effect was somewhat smaller than that observed with the anti-Ser(P)2448 antibody (Fig. 4 C). Immunoblotting with mTAb2 indicated that the extract samples contained approximately equal amounts of mTOR (Fig. 4 D). Thus, the changes in anti-Ser(P)2448 and mTAb1 binding indicate that synergist ablation increased the phosphorylation of mTOR. Because increasing muscle load increased phosphorylation of mTOR, we were interested in determining whether decreasing load would decrease phosphorylation of the protein. To investigate this possibility, rats were suspended by their tails to unload their hindlimbs. Fourteen days of this treatment decreased the weight of the gastrocnemius muscle by 35% (2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Unloading the gastrocnemius muscles in this manner decreased the phosphorylation of Ser2448 by ∼60% (Fig. 5, A and B). Restoring load on the muscles by removing the suspension apparatus fully reversed the effect of unloading. Hindlimb suspension was without effect on binding of mTAb1 (Fig. 5 C) or on the total amount of mTOR (Fig. 5 D) Insulin and muscle loading were found to increase the phosphorylation of Ser2448. These findings provide the first direct evidence of modification of mTOR in skeletal muscle and have potentially important implications in the control of muscle protein synthesis. Previous results suggested that Ser2448 is important in the control of mTOR activity. Brunn et al. (16Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mTAb1, which binds to the region of mTOR containing this site, markedly increased the PHAS-I kinase activity of mTOR. Scott et al. (22Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.R. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) later noted that insulin promoted the phosphorylation of mTOR in this region and proposed that phosphorylation of Ser2448 activated mTOR (22Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.R. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Next, Sekulic et al. (21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar) generated a mutant recombinant mTOR lacking the 20-amino acid mTAb1 epitope and discovered that the mutant enzyme exhibited enhanced protein kinase activity. Based on these observations, it was suggested the region containing the epitope was an inhibitory regulatory domain and that phosphorylation of Ser2448 might activate mTOR by relieving the inhibition. Activation of mTOR would be expected to lead to increased phosphorylation of the downstream effectors, PHAS-I and p70S6K, resulting in increased protein synthesis. Results from mutagenesis studies have cast some doubt on the significance of Ser2448 phosphorylation. Sekulic et al. (21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar) investigated the effects of overexpressing an mTOR protein having an Ala2448 mutation on the phosphorylation of p70S6K and PHAS-I in HEK293 cells. The effects of the Ala2448-mutated mTOR in supporting activation of p70S6K in response to insulin were no different from those of mTOR with Ser2448. This finding would argue strongly against a role of Ser2448phosphorylation as an important regulator of mTOR function were it not for the fact that the overexpression studies were conducted with forms of mTOR rendered rapamycin-resistant by mutating Ser2035 to Ile. We have recently discovered that this mutation markedly inhibits the ability of mTOR to phosphorylate PHAS-I in vitro. 3L. McMahon and J. C. Lawrence, Jr., manuscript in preparation. Thus, preventing phosphorylation of Ser2448 by the Ala2448mutation in rapamycin-resistant mTOR (Ser2035 to Ile mutation) would not be expected to decrease activity toward PHAS-I, because this form of mTOR already exhibits reduced activity. Additional studies will be needed to address the functional effect of Ser2448 phosphorylation on mTOR activity. The effects of insulin on increasing Ser2448 in hemidiaphragms were associated with activation of PKB (Fig. 3). This finding is consistent with other studies, which have generated three main lines of evidence supporting the conclusion that the phosphorylation of Ser2448 is controlled by PKB (20Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar). First, Ser2448 and the surrounding sequence is a good fit to the consensus motif (R XR XX(S/T)h), where X is any amino acid and h is a hydrophobic residue) for phosphorylation by PKB (27Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and Ser2448 can be phosphorylated by purified PKB in vitro (20Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar). Second, increasing PKB in cells is associated with increased phosphorylation of Ser2448. Insulin activated endogenous PKB activity and increased the phosphorylation of Ser2448 in HEK293 cells, CHOIR800 cells, and 3T3L1 adipocytes (20Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 22Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.R. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpressing a constitutively active PKB in HEK293 cells or activating a PKB-estrogen fusion protein with tamoxifen in MER-Akt cells decreased mTAb1 binding, suggestive of increased phosphorylation of Ser2448 (22Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.R. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Third, inhibition of PKB is associated with decreases in Ser2448 phosphorylation. In 3T3L1 adipocytes, phosphorylation of Ser2448 was blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which also block activation of PKB (22Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.R. Lawrence J.C. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Also, overexpressing a kinase-dead PKB in HEK293 cells blocked Ser2448 phosphorylation (21Sekulić A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar). Like insulin, the degree of muscle loading can alter mRNA translation, protein synthesis, and muscle mass (1Baar K. Esser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 45: C120-C127Crossref Google Scholar, 2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat.

Physiol. 1999; 45: C120-C127Crossref Google Scholar, 2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat.

Muscle atrophy induced by hindlimb suspension (2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat.

Physiol. 2001; 281: C179-C187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is associated with a decrease in the phosphorylation of p70S6K; whereas, muscle hypertrophy following resistance training is associated with an increase in p70S6K phosphorylation (1Baar K. Esser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 45: C120-C127Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, overload-induced hypertrophy of the rat plantaris muscle is associated with an increase in p70S6k activity and a decrease in PHAS-1 bound to eIF4E, indicating an increase in mRNA translation initiation (2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the changes in Ser2448 phosphorylation observed with muscle loading and unloading correlate well with the changes in PKB phosphorylation noted by Bodine et al. (2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Thus, both muscle mass and PKB phosphorylation were decreased in gastrocnemius muscles following hindlimb suspension, and synergist ablation resulted in an ∼40% increase in the mass of the plantaris muscle and promoted a severalfold increase in the phosphorylation of PKB (2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1014-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in PKB activity are responsible for the changes in Ser2448phosphorylation observed in muscles undergoing atrophy or hypertrophy in response to changes in muscle load. Nave et al. (20Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) have presented evidence that insulin and amino acid signaling converge at mTOR in HEK293 cells. The present findings in skeletal muscle are consistent with such a view, as insulin promoted the phosphorylation of Ser2448. However, there are some differences between our results and those of Nave et al. (20Nave B.T. Ouwens D.M. Withers D.J. Alessi D.R. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells amino acid withdrawal decreased Ser2448 phosphorylation and abolished the ability of insulin to stimulate Ser2448 phosphorylation. In hemidiaphragms exogenous amino acids were not required for the stimulatory effect of insulin on Ser2448 phosphorylation. Thus, there may be differences among cell types in the relative requirements for insulin and amino acids for the phosphorylation of Ser2448. This would not be surprising as different cells exhibit differing requirements for exogenous amino acids for the stimulatory effects of insulin on the phosphorylation of PHAS-I and p70S6K (28Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 29Patti M.E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in muscles incubated in vitro there may be adequate endogenous amino acids to allow for an insulin effect in the absence of exogenous amino acids. Amino acids did not activate PKB in skeletal muscle (Fig. 3), which is in agreement with results obtained in numerous cell types (28Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar,29Patti M.E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the present study indicates that insulin activates PKB and promotes the phosphorylation of Ser2448 in mTOR in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that increasing muscle load leads to increased phosphorylation of this site. The fact that these treatments increase mRNA translation (1Baar K. Esser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 45: C120-C127Crossref Google Scholar, 2Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J. Yancopoulus G.D. Nat.

Physiol. 2000; 279: E715-E729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicates that increased phosphorylation of Ser2448 might have an important functional role and is at the very least a marker for increased protein synthesis in skeletal muscle."

A single PPARγ-null embryo that was rescued at term exhibited a lethal combination of pathologies, including lipodystrophy and multiple hemorrhages. Because PPARγ is found in a broad spectrum of cell types, tissue-specific gene targeting of the PPARγ gene is necessary to expand our knowledge of its physiological role. Conditional disruption of the PPARγ gene in macrophages resulted in lowered expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, and apoE and reduced cholesterol efflux (21Akiyama T.E.,S. S. Lambert G. Nicol C. Matsusue K.

In this report, the role of PPARγ was investigated by deletion of the gene in mammary epithelium, ovary, and B- and T-cells using Cre-loxP-mediated recombination. Mice were generated that carried loxP sites in the first and second intron of the PPARγ gene (21Akiyama T.E.,S. S. Lambert G. Nicol C. Matsusue K. Pimprale S. Lee Y. Ricote M. Glass C.

Through the generation of mice that carry two targeted PPARγ alleles and a Cre transgene, we were able to investigate the roles of PPARγ in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis, in the ovary and the hematopoietic system. Conditional PPARγ-null mice were previously generated by floxing exon 2 of the PPARγ gene (21Akiyama T.E.,S. S. Lambert G. Nicol C. Matsusue K. Pimprale S. Lee Y. Ricote M. Glass C. Brewer Jr, H.B. Gonzalez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2607-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These mice were mated with MMTV-Cre and WAP-Cre transgenic mice (22Wagner K.U. Wall R.J., St- Onge L.

Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). The genotypes of the mice were determined by PCR analysis. Primers for the PPARγ gene were F (5′-ctc caa tgt tct caa act tac-3′), R1 (5′-gat gag tca tgt aag ttg acc-3′), and R2 (5′-gta ttc tat ggc ttc cag tgc-3′), which yielded a 225-bp band from the wild type allele, a 275-bp band from the floxed allele, or a 400-bp band from the null allele (95 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 90 s; 35 cycles). Primers for the Cre transgenes were 5′-tag agc tgt gcc agc ctc ttc c-3′ (which binds in the WAP gene promoter), 5′-ggt tct gat ctg agc tct gag tg-3′ (which binds in the MMTV-LTR), and 5′-cat cac tcg ttg cat cga ccg g-3′ (which binds in the Cre sequence). The WAP-Cre transgene produced a 240-bp fragment and MMTV-Cre transgene yielded a 280-bp fragment (95 °C, 30 s; 65 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min; 30 cycles). The ROSA26 transgene produced a 425-bp product with primers 5′-gat ccg cgc tgg cta ccg gc-3′ and 5′-gga tac tga cga aac gcc tgc c-3′ (95 °C, 30 s; 65 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min; 30 cycles). All products were separated in 2% agarose Tris acetate/EDTA gels. In the study, all the control mice were PPARγ fl/fl littermates. Total RNA from mammary gland samples was isolated at different time points by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blots were prepared with 20 μg of total RNA per lane. The hybridization probe was an approximate 1-kb BamHI/SpeI fragment from the 3′-part of the PPARγ cDNA. The identity of the probe was confirmed by sequencing. The inguinal mammary gland was biopsied at the indicated times of development and spread on a glass slide. After fixation for 4 h in Carnoy's solution, the glands were hydrated and stained with carminalum and dehydrated and mounted as described by Kordon et al. (25Kordon E.C. McKnight R.A. Jhappan C. Hennighausen L. Merlino G. Smith G.H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The glands were photographed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For the β-galactosidase assay, the tissues were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.25% glutaraldehyde, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h and prestained in 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline. Following the prestain, the samples were stained for 24–48 h at 30 °C in 30 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 30 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside). Samples were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then dehydrated, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. The sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red. Ovaries were fixed in Bouin's solution overnight and then washed in 70% ethanol. Paraplast (VWR Scientific, Buffalo Grove, IL)-embedded ovaries were serial-sectioned (8 μm) through the entire tissue, mounted on glass slides, and stained with Weigert's hematoxylin/picric acid methylene blue. Every 10th section was analyzed for the number of primordial, primary, and pre-antral/antral follicle numbers. The number of follicles in every 10th section was multiplied by 8 in order to give an estimate of the total follicle numbers. Only the follicles with a visible nucleus in the oocyte were counted to avoid double counting. The endogenous epithelium of athymic nude 3-week-old mice was removed as described by DeOme et al. (26DeOme K.B. Faulkin L.J., Jr. Bern H.A. Blair P.E. Cancer Res. 1959; 19: 515-520PubMed Google Scholar). A piece of mammary tissue from a mature virgin donor was implanted into the center of the remaining fat pad. Mammary tissues from PPARγ fl/fl; MC(F), and fl/fl mice were transplanted into the right and left sides of the same nude mouse, respectively. To obtain transplanted tissues at term, the hosts were mated 8 weeks after they received the transplant, and the mammary glands were harvested the morning after delivery. Progesterone levels were measure by radioimmunoassay using Coat-A-Count (Diagnostic Products Corporations, Los Angeles, CA). Mice were anesthetized, and blood was collected by phlebotomy from the retro-orbital plexus. Serum was separated from cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 rpm. Three 8-week-old PPARγ fl/fl; MC(F) virgin mice and four control mice were checked for estrus cycles, and blood was collected at the estrus day. Serum from six 8-week-old fl/fl; MC(F) and six fl/fl pseudopregnant mice (intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) followed 48 h later by intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) every 24 h for a total of 72 h) was analyzed. Three PPARγ fl/fl; MC(F) adult females and two control females were mated with males of the same strain. The morning of finding a vaginal plug was designated day 0.5 of pregnancy. On day 6.5 of pregnancy, implantation sites were visualized by staining the uterus with 1% ammonium sulfide (Sigma) for 20 min. The implantation sites were identified by the unstained bands along the uterus (the uterus was stained blue). Single cell suspensions from spleen were depleted of erythrocytes and 106 cells were incubated with different combinations of antibodies for two-color fluorescence surface staining. Data were collected in a FACS calibur flow cytometer (BD PharMingen) and analyzed using CELLQuest software (BD PharMingen). The following monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-B220 (clone RA3-6B2), anti-CD11b (clone MacI), anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5), anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7) All the antibodies were purchase from BD PharMingen. Because PPARγ-null mice die by day E10 (20Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar), it has not been possible to investigate the function of PPARγ in tissue development and physiology. To overcome this obstacle, we generated mice in which the PPARγ gene can be deleted in specific cell types using the Cre-loxP recombination system. Exon 2 of the PPARγ gene was flanked by loxP sites to generate PPARγ-floxed mice (21Akiyama T.E.,S. S. Lambert G. Nicol C. Matsusue K. Pimprale S. Lee Y. Ricote M. Glass C. Brewer Jr, H.B. Gonzalez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2607-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), which were bred with transgenic mice that carry the Cre gene under control of either the MMTV-LTR or the WAP gene promoter (22Wagner K.U. Wall R.J., St- Onge L. Gruss P. Wynshaw-Boris A. Garrett L., Li, M. Furth P.A. Hennighausen L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4323-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 23Wagner K.U. McAllister K. Ward T. Davis B. Wiseman R. Hennighausen L. Transgenic Res. 2001; 10: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Loss of exon 2 leads to a premature termination of translation (21Akiyama T.E.,S. S. Lambert G. Nicol C. Matsusue K. Pimprale S. Lee Y. Ricote M. Glass C. Brewer Jr, H.B. Gonzalez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2607-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Mice that carry floxed PPARγ alleles and the MMTV-Cre transgene are referred to as fl/fl; MC mice and those carrying the WAP-Cre transgene as fl/fl; WC mice. The WAP-Cre transgene is expressed almost exclusively in mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation, whereas the MMTV-Cre transgene is active in many tissues (23Wagner K.U. McAllister K. Ward T. Davis B. Wiseman R. Hennighausen L. Transgenic Res. 2001; 10: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We used two lines of transgenic mice expressing the MMTV-Cre transgene. While in the D line (MC(D)) the transgene is expressed in several secretory organs and the hematopoietic system (23Wagner K.U. McAllister K. Ward T. Davis B. Wiseman R. Hennighausen L. Transgenic Res. 2001; 10: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), it is also expressed in ovarian tissue in the F line (MC(F)). The cell-specificity of Cre expression in the MC(F) line was established using the Rosa26 reporter strain (Fig. 1 A). Cre activity was found in mammary ductal and alveolar epithelium, in the salivary gland, oocytes, granulosa cells, megacaryocytes, and B- and T-cells, but not in the uterus. We further evaluated the extent of MC(F)-mediated excision of exon 2 of the PPARγ gene and its tissue distribution by PCR analysis of fl/fl; MC(F) mice. Extensive excision was observed in mammary tissue, B- and T-cells, and to a lesser extent in granulosa cells (Fig. 1 B). Isolated B- and T-cells from the spleen of the conditional knockout mice exhibited a high recombination efficiency of the PPARγ gene. There was no excision of the PPARγ gene in the uterus, which demonstrated the absence of Cre recombinase expression. It has been shown that the PPARγ gene is expressed in both normal mammary epithelial cells and stromal cells (15Mueller E. Sarraf P. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Martin K.J. Zhang M. Fletcher C. Singer S. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 465-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). We further established the profile of PPARγ during mammary development by using northern blot analyses (Fig. 2 A). PPARγ mRNA levels were high in virgin tissue and during pregnancy, decreased during lactation, and were reestablished at day 4 of involution. Highest levels of PPARγ mRNA were detected in cleared fat pad, which demonstrates that PPARγ is more abundant in stromal cells than in epithelial cells. To investigate the role of PPARγ in mammopoiesis, we monitored ductal and alveolar development as well as mammary function in fl/fl; MC and fl/fl; WC mice. Ductal elongation and branching during puberty were normal upon inactivation with both the fl/fl; MC(D) and (F) line (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, the formation and differentiation of the alveolar compartment appeared normal in fl/fl; WC and fl/fl; MC(D) mice (Fig. 3), and the dams could support their litters. However, pregnancy-mediated alveolar development in fl/fl; MC(F) mice was impaired, and the fat pad was rarely filled with lobules (Fig. 3). Those dams that had only a sparsely developed lobular compartment could not nurse their pups. To investigate whether the mammary gland phenotype in fl/fl; MC(F) mice was autonomous to the epithelium or caused by systemic defects, we performed mammary epithelial transplants. Epithelium from fl/fl; MC(F) mice was transplanted into the cleared fat pad of athymic nude mice, and mammary development was evaluated at parturition. At parturition, fl/fl; MC(F) mammary epithelium had developed normally, and the fat pad was filled with secretory alveoli (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the incomplete mammary development in fl/fl; MC(F) mice was not the result of a primary defect in the epithelium, but rather a secondary defect. PPARγ is highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines and infiltrating ductal breast adenocarcinomas (15Mueller E. Sarraf P. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Martin K.J. Zhang M. Fletcher C. Singer S. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 465-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), and the activation of PPARγ has been known to inhibit growth and induce apoptosis and terminal differentiation of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (15Mueller E.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the loss of PPARγ would sensitize mice to tumor formation. To investigate this possibility, we observed more than 30 PPARγ fl/fl; MC mice, 20 fl/fl; WC mice, and an equal number of control mice over a period of 12 months. These mice were bred ad libidum. None of these mice developed tumors over the 12 months. After 15 months 2 fl/fl; MC mouse and 1 control mouse developed breast tumors. These results suggest PPARγ is not a strong and dominant tumor suppressor. PPARγ has been found in bovine (27Sundvold H. Brzozowska A. Lien S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) ovaries. Reverse transcription-PCR results confirmed that the PPARγ gene is also expressed in the mouse ovary (data not shown). One-third (11/35) of fl/fl; MC(F) females were infertile, and the remainder exhibited impaired fertility. On the average fl/fl; MC(F) conceived after 22 days of mating, while it took control mice only 8 days (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4). In addition, litter sizes of fl/fl; MC(F) dams were small (3 ± 2 pups), while there were 6 ± 3 pups in the fl/fl mice (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4). To investigate the cause of the impaired fertility, we performed morphometric analyses on ovaries from 3-month-old fl/fl; MC(F) (n = 4) and fl/fl females (n = 4). There was no significant difference in the numbers of primordial (9720 ± 3595 versus 9460 ± 5008 in fl/fl; MC(F)versus fl/fl ovaries, p = 0.935), primary (2940 ± 1253 versus 2760 ± 847,p = 0.819) and preantral/antral (5240 ± 1201 versus 6620 ± 2145, p = 0.304) follicles. We also treated fl/fl; MC(F) (n = 2) and control (n = 2) mice with PMSG (5 IU/mouse) and hCG (5 IU/mouse) to induce superovulation. There was no difference in the number of oocytes (25 versus 20) released in response to PMSG. Reduced fertility of PPARγ fl/fl; MC(F) mice could also be the result of decreased levels of progesterone. We therefore measured progesterone levels in virgin mice at the estrus day (n = 4 in each group). Although the progesterone level in fl/fl; MC(F) mice (6.3 ± 3.1 ng/ml) was lower than that in the control (12.5 ± 7.5 ng/ml) mice, the difference was not significant (p = 0.204). We also measured the progesterone levels in mice injected with 5 IU of PMSG followed 48 h later by 5 IU of hCG injection. Progesterone levels were 43.6 ± 21.2 ng/ml in fl/fl; MC(F) mice and 51.5 ± 19.6 in fl/fl mice (n = 6 in each group). There was no significant difference. We collected and fixed the ovaries from these virgin and pseudopregnant mice, and measured the size of the corpus luteum. There were no differences in morphology or size of the corpus luteum between the fl/fl; MC(F) and control mice ovaries. We also examined the number of implantations in utero of PPARγ fl/fl; MC(F) and control mice. Implantation occurs between days 3.5 and 4 (33Binart N. Helloco C. Ormandy C.J. Barra J. Clement-Lacroix P. Baran N. Kelly P.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2691-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and we counted implantation sites at day 6.5 postcoitus. We found six implantation sites in one of the three PPARγ fl/fl; MC(F) mice but none in the other two. In the two control mice we found five and seven implantation sites, respectively. As described earlier (Fig. 1), Cre was not expressed in the uterus, and the PPARγ gene had remained intact. A possible role for PPARγ in the differentiation of B- and T-cells has been reported (3Clark R.B. Bishop-Bailey D. Estrada-Hernandez T. Hla T. Puddington L. Padula S.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 34Padilla J. Kaur K. Cao H.J. Smith T.J. Phipps R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6941-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To address whether the development of B- and T-cells requires the presence of PPARγ, we analyzed B- and T-cell populations from spleen using FACS cytometry (Fig. 5). In control mice, B-cells constitute ∼50%, T-cells 35%, and macrophages 5% of the total cells in spleen. The same ratio was observed in spleens from PPARγ fl/fl; MC(F) mice. These results suggest that PPARγ is not required for the generation of B- or T-cells. A variety of functions have been attributed to PPARγ. Activation of PPARγ promotes differentiation and induces apoptosis in a broad range of human malignant cell lines, including breast cancer (15Mueller E. Sarraf P. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Martin K.J.

Patel M.K. Koeffler H.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 418-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast with this, other studies show that activation of PPARγ promotes the development of colon tumors in C57BL/6-APC−/+ mice (38Lefebvre A.M. Chen I. Desreumaux P. Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Geboes K. Briggs M. Heyman R. Auwerx J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar,39Saez E. Tontonoz P. Nelson M.C. Alvarez J.G. Ming U.T. Baird S.M. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The use of mice in which the PPARγ gene is inactivated should shed light on the role of PPARγ on normal development, physiology, and tumorigenesis. Because traditional PPARγ-null mice are embryonic lethal (20Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 585-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar), we have now investigated the role of PPARγ through the deletion of the gene in several cell types using Cre-loxP-mediated recombination. Inactivation of the PPARγ gene in mammary epithelium with WAP-Cre or MMTV-Cre (D) mice did not interfere with normal development during pregnancy, and lactation was not impaired. Thus unlike other members of the steroid receptor family (40Hennighausen L. Robinson G.W. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), PPARγ is not essential for ductal and lobulo-alveolar development. Furthermore, we did not observe an increased incidence of mammary tumors. This suggests that PPARγ by itself is not vital for development and is not a dominant tumor suppressor. It is possible that other members of this family, such as PPARα and PPARβ, compensate for the loss of PPARγ, similar to the pRb family (41Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Hennighausen L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7115-7119Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The expression of an active oncogene in mammary epithelium devoid of PPARγ (possibly through a transgene) will eventually establish whether PPARγ has any tumor suppressor function in the breast. Inactivation of the PPARγ gene with an MMTV-Cre(F) transgene resulted in impaired fertility and abrogated mammary development. However, lack of functional mammary development is probably a consequence to the ovarian dysfunction for several reasons. Results of mammary epithelial transplants demonstrated the PPARγ-null epithelium could develop into a differentiated mammary gland. In situ hybridization has shown that PPARγ mRNA is present in the ovary and primarily in the granulosa cells of developing follicles, but not in the oocytes (31Komar C.M. Braissant O. Wahli W. Curry T.E., Jr. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4831-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Following the luteinizing hormone surge, levels of PPARγ mRNA decline suggesting a role in ovarian function (31Komar C.M. Braissant O. Wahli W. Curry T.E., Jr. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4831-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the MMTV-Cre(F) line of transgenic mice expresses Cre in oocytes, granulosa cells, and the corpora lutea, and the impaired fertility could be the result of subfunctional physiology of these cell types. PPARγ fl/fl; MC(F) mice appeared to ovulate normally but exhibited impaired implantation. Because Cre was not expressed in uterine tissue and the PPARγ gene was intact, uterine dysfunction can be ruled out. In the mouse, secretion of progesterone from newly formed corpora lutea, accompanied by preimplantation ovarian estrogen secretion on day 4 of pregnancy, is critical for the establishment of uterine receptivity for implantation (42Reese J. Binart N. Brown N. Ma W.G. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Kelly P.A. Dey S.K. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The activation of PPARγ has been shown to affect progesterone production. PPARγ ligands inhibited progesterone production in cultured human and porcine granulosa cells (43Gasic S. Bodenburg Y. Nagamani M. Green A. Urban R.J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4962-4966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, they stimulated the secretion of both progesterone and E2 in cultured rat granulosa cells (31Komar C.M. Braissant O. Wahli W. Curry T.E., Jr. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4831-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In our in vivo study, progesterone levels were reduced in virgin mice upon inactivation of the PPARγ gene in granulosa cells and the corpora lutea. These mice had normal follicle numbers and normal estrous cycles. When stimulated by PMSG/hCG injection the progesterone levels increased to the normal range, and the morphology and size of the corpora lutea were normal, suggesting the ovary was functional upon exogenous hormone challenging. Under physiological conditions, the ovarian function might not be sufficient to induce implantation, which could explain the reduced fertility of PPARγ fl/fl; MC(F) mice."

Although ascorbic acid has strong antioxidant properties, it also has pro-oxidant effects in the presence of free transition metals. Vitamin C was recently reported to induce the decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides independent of metal interactions, suggesting that it may cause DNA damage. To directly address the role of vitamin C in maintaining genomic integrity we developed a genetic system for quantifying guanine base mutations induced in human cells under oxidative stress. The assay utilized a plasmid construct encoding the cDNA for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase modified to contain an amber stop codon, which was restored to wild type by G to T transversion induced by oxidative stress. The mutation frequency was determined from the number of plasmids containing the wild type chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene rescued from oxidatively stressed cells. Cells were loaded with vitamin C by exposing them to dehydroascorbic acid, thereby avoiding transition metal-related pro-oxidant effects of ascorbic acid. We found that vitamin C loading resulted in substantially decreased mutations induced by H2O2. Depletion of glutathione led to cytotoxicity and an increase in H2O2-induced mutation frequency; however, mutation frequency was prominently decreased in depleted cells preloaded with vitamin C. The mutation results correlated with a decrease in total 8-oxo-guanine measured in genomic DNA of cells loaded with vitamin C and oxidatively stressed. These findings directly support the concept that high intracellular concentrations of vitamin C can prevent oxidation-induced mutations in human cells.

These findings directly support the concept that high intracellular concentrations of vitamin C can prevent oxidation-induced mutations in human cells. DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species such as H2O2, O2⨪, and ⋅OH radicals has been implicated in mutagenesis, oncogenesis, and aging (1.Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In vitro studies suggest that the hydroxyl radical is highly reactive toward DNA (2.Sonntag C.V. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis, London1987Google Scholar). One of the most common oxidized adducts in human cells and tissues is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) 1The abbreviations used are: 8-oxo-dG8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosineDHAdehydroascorbic acidAAascorbic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyECDelectrochemical detectionCmchloramphenicolCarbcarbenicillinCmsCm-sensitive alleleCATCm acetyltransferaseOMG3-oxy-methyl-glucose1The abbreviations used are: 8-oxo-dG8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosineDHAdehydroascorbic acidAAascorbic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyECDelectrochemical detectionCmchloramphenicolCarbcarbenicillinCmsCm-sensitive alleleCATCm acetyltransferaseOMG3-oxy-methyl-glucose (3.Wagner J.R.

This adduct results from exposure to oxidizing agents as well as from γ irradiation of DNA (4.Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4476-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and quantitation of 8-oxo-dG has been used as a marker of DNA damage (5.Kasai H. Mutat.

Although numerous studies demonstrate the antioxidant effects of vitamin C (8.Schneider M. Diemer K. Engelhart K. Zankl H. Trotter W.E. Biesalski H.K. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9.Lee B.M. Lee S.K. Kim H.S. Cancer Lett. 1998; 132: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), in vitro studies are often confounded by the pro-oxidant effects of ascorbic acid in the presence of free transition metals (10.Cai L. Koropatnick J. Cherian M.G. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 137: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We circumvented this problem using dehydroascorbic acid to load cells with vitamin C. Vitamin C is transported into most cells in the oxidized form, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), via facilitative glucose transporters (11.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 12.Rumsey S.C. Daruwala R. Al-Hasani H. Zarnowski M.J. Simpson I.A. Levine M. J. Biol.

Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). When transported as DHA it is rapidly reduced inside the cells and accumulated as ascorbic acid (14.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velasquez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We developed a new genetic system to quantify oxidative DNA damage and resulting mutagenesis in human cells to determine directly the role of vitamin C in maintaining genomic integrity. We found that vitamin C markedly decreased mutations induced by H2O2. The mutation results correlated with a decrease in total 8-oxo-dG found in genomic DNA of cells that were loaded with vitamin C and oxidatively stressed. Human kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's high glucose medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% sodium pyruvate. Human myeloid HL-60 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine. Cells were maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells (293) were transfected by Ca2+-phosphate method at 1.5 × 106cells per 100-mm plate (15.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Plates were incubated overnight, and the cells were collected. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min in incubation buffer (15 mmHEPES pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 0.8 mmMgCl2). 1.5 × 106 cells were added to incubation buffer containing 100 μm ascorbic acid and 0.2 μCi of l-[14C]ascorbic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for AA uptake or to a mixture containing ascorbic acid and ascorbate oxidase for DHA uptake. Following incubation samples were washed twice with cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS. After lysis in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2% SDS, the incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Intracellular volume was estimated as described previously (11.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 16.Vera J.C.

Loggins E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, five million cells were incubated for 60 min at room temperature in 200 μl of incubation buffer containing 1 mm 3-oxy-methyl-glucose (OMG) and 5 μCi of 3H-OMG. During incubation equilibrium (zero-trans) was established between intra- and extracellular concentrations of OMG. After incubation 2 μl of 2 mmcytochalasin B was added to the cells to prevent efflux of trapped OMG during washing, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Cells were then washed three times with cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS containing 20 μm cytochalasin B to remove unincorporated radioactivity. After lysis in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2% SDS the incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The amount of radioactivity accumulated inside the cells is in direct proportion to the intracellular volume. Tyrosine 33 codon (TAT) within the CAT gene of plasmid pCAT19 was changed to a TAG stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis using the unique restriction site elimination method (18.Zhu L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 13-29PubMed Google Scholar). The change in the sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The following primers were used in mutagenesis: mutagenic primer (amber mutation is underlined), GCT CAA TGT ACCTAG AAC CAG ACC GTT CAG C; selection primer (eliminates AatII site, underlined), GGT TTC TTAGAC Gta AGG TGG CAC TTT TCG. 293T cells were depleted of glutathione as previously described (19.Guaiquil V.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Vera J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9915-9921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells (2 × 106/100-mm plate) transfected with 6 μg of pCAT19-CmS were incubated with 200 μmdl-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (Sigma) for 16 h, followed by a 1-h incubation with 1 mm diethyl maleate (Sigma). Cells were washed with PBS and used in the in vivo DNA damage assay as described below. Total genomic DNA from 50 × 106 HL-60 cells was isolated using the blood and cell culture kit from Qiagen. The isolated DNA was digested by nuclease P1 (Sigma) and calf alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, 5–15 μg of DNA (200 μl) in 25 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm zinc chloride (pH 4.8) was boiled for 5 min and quickly chilled on ice. Nuclease P1 (0.1 units/μg of DNA) was added to DNA and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 20 μl of 1.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8) was added, and the solution was briefly vortexed. Calf alkaline phosphatase (0.075 units/μg of DNA) was added, and the solution was incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. Digested DNA was filtered through a 0.2-μm Nalgene 4-mm nylon syringe filter. Samples were further analyzed by HPLC-ECD. Digested DNA was injected onto a modified C18 column (catalog no. 70-4106, ESA, Chelmsford, MA). Equal amounts of digested DNA isolated from untreated or treated cells were injected (based on absorbance at 260 nm). The column was equilibrated with the following buffer on the mobile phase (100 mm lithium acetate, 10% methanol, pH 5) at 30 °C. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Under these conditions the retention time of 8-oxo-dG was 4 min. Peak areas for 8-oxo-dG were determined using a dominant potential for 8-oxo-dG of 270 mV. Based on calibration curve (obtained with standard solution of 8-oxo-dG) the amounts of 8-oxo-dG in total genomic DNA were determined. One microgram of plasmid pCAT19-CmS was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 15 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) in the absence or presence of 0.05 and 5 mm H2O2 and Cu2+ (25 μm). DNA was ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 5 μl of water, and electroporated into PR195. Bacteria were plated on LB plates supplemented with chloramphenicol (Cm) at 20 μg/ml as well as on LB plates supplemented with carbenicillin (Carb) at 50 μg/ml. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Mutation frequencies were determined as ratios between the number of colonies on Cm plates over the total number of colonies on Carb plates. 293T cells (2 × 106/100-mm plate) transfected with 6 μg of pCAT19-CmS were incubated with 500 μm DHA for 1 h and treated with 0.1, 0.5, and 5 mmH2O2 with Cu2+ (100 μm) or with 10 mmH2O2 without Cu2+ for 1 h. The plasmid was isolated using the SDS-NaOH lysis method (20.Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. 1. Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 1.25-1.29Google Scholar) and electroporated into PR195. Mutation frequencies were determined as outlined above. Fifty million HL-60 cells (0.3 × 106/ml) were incubated for 2 days prior to the experiment. Cells were washed in PBS, incubated with different amounts of DHA for 1 h, and treated with H2O2/Cu2+ for 22 h. Total genomic DNA was isolated using the blood and cell culture kit from Qiagen. DNA was enzymatically digested for HPLC-ECD assays as described above. The chloramphenicol-sensitive allele (CmS) of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene was used as a marker for the determination of 8-oxo-dG-related mutagenesis in DNA. The wild type sequence of the CAT gene in plasmid pCAT19 was changed by site-directed mutagenesis at codon 33 from TAT (tyrosine) to TAG (stop) as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” The resulting plasmid (pCAT19-CmS) expresses a truncated chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; therefore, bacterial cells with this allele are sensitive to chloramphenicol. The plasmid pCAT19 also carries the carbenicillin resistance gene (Carb) used for positive selection for the plasmid. Under oxidative stress 8-oxo-dG can be created throughout the DNA molecule including the mutated codon 33 within the CmSallele. Subsequent replication introduced adenine across the 8-oxo-dG. The second round of replication restored the wild type TAT codon in 50% of the replicated DNA (7.Wood M.L. Dizdaroglu M. Gajewski E. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7024-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A), and consequently those cells became resistant to Cm. Thus, the degree of oxidative DNA damage was expressed as a function of Cm-resistant colonies that appeared over Carb-resistant colonies. Mutations outside the TAG stop codon in the mutated CAT gene were not detected by this assay. The probability of two mutations occurring in the same plasmid (as two independent events) is approximately 10−9 and is beyond the detection sensitivity of the assay. To test the plasmid for the induction of mutations by oxidative stress, pCAT19-CmS was incubated with either 5 mmH2O2 or 25 μm Cu2+ as well as with 50 μm H2O2 in the presence of 25 μm Cu2+ for 1 h at 37 °C. Treated DNA was electroporated into Escherichia coli strain PR195 (fpg mutY) along with untreated DNA as a control. The PR195 strain was deficient in the removal of both 8-oxo-dG (fpg) (21.Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and adenines across 8-oxo-dG (mutY) (22.Tsai-Wu J.J. Liu H.F. Lu A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The latter mutation ensured that all 8-oxo-dG created in human cells were counted. Bacteria were plated on LB plates with chloramphenicol at 20 μg/ml as well as on LB plates with carbenicillin at 50 μg/ml. Mutation frequencies were determined as ratios of the number of colonies on Cm plates to the number of colonies on Carb plates. The absolute mutation frequency in untreated DNA was approximately 4 × 10−5. DNA treated with 5 mm H2O2 showed a 27-fold increase in mutation frequencies, and the addition of Cu2+ ions induced further increases in mutation frequencies even at low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1 B). Copper ions alone, however, did not induce mutagenesis (Fig. 1 B). These experiments demonstrated that the system was suitable for quantifying the frequency of mutations induced by oxidative stress. We used the 293T human kidney cell line to study mutagenesis induced by hydrogen peroxide because of the high transfection frequency of these cells (80–90%). This made them suitable for the study of DNA damage under non-replicative conditions (15.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCAT19-CmS has no mammalian origin of replication and therefore cannot be replicated inside 293T cells. Cells were transfected with pCAT19-CmS and were treated with H2O2 24 h later (Fig. 1 C). Plasmid DNA was extracted from the cells, purified and electroporated into PR195, and analyzed for mutation frequencies (ratio of CmR to CarbR colonies). We found a roughly linear increase in mutation frequency with increasing concentrations of H2O2 in the presence of 100 μmCu2+ (Fig. 1 D). The addition of Cu2+ions presumably led to increased oxidation and G to T transversion mutations in the plasmid due to ⋅OH generation via the Fenton reaction. Cells treated with 5 mmH2O2 and 100 μm Cu2+showed a 6-fold increase in mutation frequency compared with control. However, cells incubated with Cu2+ ions alone evidenced no increase in mutation frequencies (Fig. 1 D). Hydrogen peroxide without added copper did not cause a significant increase in mutations under these conditions even at concentrations of 10 mm (Fig. 1 D). We therefore used 5 mmH2O2 and 100 μm Cu2+to study the role of vitamin C in the prevention of oxidative DNA damage in 293T cells. Previously we showed that vitamin C is transported into the cells preferentially in the oxidized form as DHA through facilitative glucose transporters (11.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Once inside the cell DHA is rapidly reduced to ascorbic acid (14.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velasquez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We found that 293T cells incubated with 500 μm DHA for 60 min accumulated 7 nmol of ascorbic acid/106 cells (Fig. 2 A). We estimated the internal volume of 293T cells as 1.0 μl/106 cells from tritiated methylglucose equilibrium studies (see “Materials and Methods”). Based on this internal volume 293T cells incubated with 500 μm DHA for 60 min accumulated 7 mm ascorbic acid. However, cells incubated with 500 μm AA for 60 min accumulated only 0.7 mm ascorbic acid (Fig. 2 A). We investigated the effect of vitamin C loading by exposure to DHA in preventing mutations induced by oxidative stress in the 293T cells. Hydrogen peroxide with copper increased mutation frequency by 8-fold compared with the control (Fig. 2 B). Cells incubated with 500 μm DHA for 60 min prior to H2O2/Cu2+ treatment showed a markedly reduced mutation frequency similar to the control level (Fig. 2 B). This result indicated that vitamin C inhibits mutagenesis induced by oxidative stress in vitro. Under these conditions, cells with an intracellular concentration of 7 mm vitamin C were resistant to mutagenesis when treated with 5 mm H2O2 and 100 μm Cu2+. Glutathione and vitamin C are the most abundant natural antioxidants in human cells, and their functions are partially overlapping (23.Guaiquil V.H. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40955-40961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We investigated whether vitamin C could protect cells depleted of glutathione under oxidative stress. 293T cells were depleted of glutathione as described (19.Guaiquil V.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W. Vera J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9915-9921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23.Guaiquil V.H. Vera J.C. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40955-40961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and treated with H2O2. Depletion of glutathione substantially increased the toxicity of H2O2. Glutathione-depleted cells did not survive treatment with 5 mm H2O2 and 100 μmCu2+ for 1 h (data not shown). Cells depleted of glutathione showed a 2- to 3-fold increase in frequency of mutations as compared with unmodified cells (Fig. 2 C). To study the role of vitamin C in the prevention of mutagenesis in glutathione-depleted cells, the concentration of H2O2 was lowered to the micromolar level. At 250 μmH2O2 and 100 μm Cu2+there was a 7-fold increase in mutation frequency over control (Fig. 2 D). Under these conditions a prominent antimutagenic effect of vitamin C was observed in glutathione-depleted cells. Cells incubated with 500 μm DHA for 60 min prior to oxidative stress had mutation frequencies similar to those of untreated cells (Fig. 2 D). As evidenced in the results shown in Fig. 2, antimutagenic effects of vitamin C could be observed in both unmodified and glutathione-depleted cells. Similar results were obtained when the glutathione-depleted cells were treated with 500 μmH2O2 100 μm Cu2+(data not shown). Because generation of 8-oxo-dG on the plasmid DNA induces G to T transversions, we sought to determine whether vitamin C directly inhibits formation of 8-oxo-dG in genomic DNA. A time course analysis demonstrated that to generate 8-oxo-dG in genomic DNA by oxidative stress, prolonged incubation for at least 20 h with H2O2 and Cu2+ was necessary (data not shown). We chose HL-60 for these studies because 293T cells could not survive prolonged incubation with H2O2 and Cu2+. HL-60 cells were incubated with DHA for 1 h and treated with 100 μm H2O2/100 μm Cu2+ for 22 h. Cells treated under these conditions expressed ∼75% viability (Fig. 3 A). In oxidatively stressed cells there was a 10-fold increase in 8-oxo-dG over the control. Cells incubated with either 500 μm or 1 mm DHA for 60 min prior to oxidative stress showed a complete inhibition in formation of 8-oxo-dG (Fig. 3 B). This protective effect of vitamin C loading was dose-dependent. 100 μm DHA reduced 8-oxo-dG by ∼50% (Fig. 3 B). Cells incubated with 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mmDHA showed no increase in 8-oxo-dG (Fig. 3 B). Although dead cells are not excluded by the assay, and vitamin C could protect cells from death caused by oxidative challenge, such an effect would not change the conclusions based on 8-oxo-dG measurements. The viability of the HL-60 cells treated with 1 mm DHA for 60 min was greater then 95%, as measured by trypan blue exclusion. We determined previously that in HL-60 cells uptake of DHA proceeds in a near linear fashion for about 30 min with no saturation by 60 min (14.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velasquez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The lack of toxicity to DHA may relate to its rapid uptake and conversion intracellularly to ascorbic acid. Quantification of 8-oxo-dG in genomic DNA revealed that cells treated with H2O2 contained 0.53 mmol of 8-oxo-dG/mol of G. Background levels of 8-oxo-dG in HL-60 cells were 0.053 mmol of 8-oxo-dG/mol of G (or 1 8-oxo-dG/19,000 G), which is higher than previously reported (1.Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5354) Google Scholar). The degree of protection against oxidative stress in HL-60 cells correlated to the quantity of vitamin C present inside the cells. We determined the intracellular volume of HL-60 as 0.6 μl per million of cells (see “Materials and Methods”). Based on DHA uptake studies (24.Rivas C.I. Vera J.C. Guaiquil V.H. Velasquez F.V. Borquez-Ojeda O.A. Carcamo J.G. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol.

There is considerable lay and scientific controversy regarding the role of vitamin C in preventing oxidative DNA damage. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have reported on the antioxidant (25.Fraga C.G. Motchnik P.A. Shigenaga M.K. Helbock H.J. Jacob R.A. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer. 1997; 27: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) effects of ascorbic acid. Conversely, other studies have showed that under certain conditions, vitamin C functions as a pro-oxidant and can increase DNA damage (30.Galloway S.M. Painter R.B. Mutat. Res. 1979; 60: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31.Rosin M.P. San R.H. Stich H.F. Cancer Lett. 1980; 8: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32.Speit G. Wolf M.

It is well known that ascorbic acid acts as a pro-oxidant in the presence of free transition metals (Cu2+, Fe3+) (10.Cai L. Koropatnick J. Cherian M.G. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 137: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Many in vitroexperiments with cells have been performed with ascorbic acid with confounding results caused by the generation of H2O2 and subsequently ⋅OH via the Fenton reaction (35.Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 48-54Google Scholar). Although free transition metals (iron, for example) are essential, iron-dependent reactions are controlled in vivo through sequestration of iron in non-catalytic protein-bound forms (35.Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 48-54Google Scholar). Thus, it is generally believed that the antioxidant properties of ascorbate outweigh any pro-oxidant properties in vivo. Podmore et al. (36.Podmore I.D. Griffiths H.R. Herbert K.E. Mistry N. Mistry P. Lunec J. Nature. 1998; 392: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) suggested that vitamin C exhibits simultaneous pro-oxidant and antioxidant properties based on in vivo studies. He administered vitamin C as a dietary supplement to healthy volunteers and found that the level of 8-oxo-dG in peripheral blood lymphocytes decreased with supplementation relative to placebo; however, there was a significant increase in 8-oxo-dA levels. These contradictory results are difficult to rationalize. On the other hand, Fraga et al. (25.Fraga C.G. Motchnik P.A. Shigenaga M.K. Helbock H.J. Jacob R.A. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11003-11006Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) showed that decreasing the dietary uptake of ascorbate elevated the level of 8-oxo-dG in human sperm DNA as measured by HPLC. In another study, Brennan et al. (37.Brennan L.A. Morris G.M. Wasson G.R. Hannigan B.M. Barnett Y.A. Br. J. Nutr. 2000; 84: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) found that oral supplementation with vitamin C in human volunteers decreased H2O2-induced DNA damage in isolated human lymphocytes but had no effect on endogenous levels of DNA damage. A recent study by Lee et al. (38.Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Science. 2001; 292: 2083-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) pointed to potential pro-oxidant properties of ascorbic acid based on the decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides induced by vitamin C in vitroindependent of free transition metals. Under controlled and extracellular conditions they found that vitamin C can generate 4,5-epoxy-2(E)-decenal (4,5-EDE) from lipid hydroperoxides. Because 4,5-EDE can lead to the generation of etheno-2′-deoxyadenosine, they concluded that vitamin C could cause mutations. These studies, however, did not address the question of whether this reaction occurs inside cells, and limited studies in human volunteers did not support the notion of vitamin C-induced lipid peroxidation (39.Levine M. Wang Y. Padayatty S.J. Morrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9842-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Measurement of 8-oxo-dG is one of the most common methods of assessing DNA damage, but there is no consensus on the actual levels in human DNA. Halliwell (40.Halliwell B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 72: 1082-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) states that a common artifact in measuring 8-oxo-dG levels in DNA is artificial oxidation. We directly addressed the role of vitamin C in mutagenesis by developing a quantitative plasmid-based genetic system that allowed for the quantification of oxidatively induced mutations in human cells in vitro. The effect of extracellular ascorbic acid, generating reactive oxygen species in conjunction with free transition metals, was circumvented by loading cells with vitamin C by incubation with DHA (11.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 14.Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Velasquez F.V. Zhang R.H. Concha I.I. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23706-23712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our results directly support the hypothesis that vitamin C protects against oxidative DNA damage in human cells under oxidative stress. This was true for unmodified cells as well as those depleted of glutathione, and the protection was dose-dependent. The prevention of oxidative damage by vitamin C was general in nature, inhibiting the creation of 8-oxo-dG in plasmid DNA as well as genomic DNA. Thus, direct measurement of 8-oxo-dG in genomic DNA confirmed the results of the genetic assay. Under physiological conditions vitamin C circulates in the blood in its reduced form, ascorbic acid, at ∼30–50 μm. There is a wide range of intracellular concentrations of vitamin C in human cells and tissues. Levine et al. (39.Levine M. Wang Y. Padayatty S.J. Morrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9842-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) found that lymphocytes accumulate 3.5 mm ascorbic acid at oral intakes of 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily (41.Levine M.

https://openalex.org/W2055879321,"The strontium-to-calcium ratio (Sr/Ca) of reef coral skeleton is commonly used as a paleothermometer to estimate sea surface temperatures (SSTs) at crucial times in Earth's climate history. However, these estimates are disputed, because uptake of Sr into coral skeleton is thought to be affected by algal symbionts (zooxanthellae) living in the host tissue. Here, we show that significant distortion of the Sr/Ca temperature record in coral skeleton occurs in the presence of algal symbionts. Seasonally resolved Sr/Ca in coral without symbionts reflects local SSTs with a temperature sensitivity equivalent to that of laboratory aragonite precipitated at equilibrium and the nighttime skeletal deposits of symbiotic reef corals. However, up to 65% of the Sr/Ca variability in symbiotic skeleton is related to symbiont activity and does not reflect water temperature."

In a previous study using transfected 293 cells, we showed that corin converted pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), suggesting that corin is likely the pro-ANP convertase. Because other serine proteases such as thrombin and kallikrein had previously also been shown to cleave pro-ANP in vitro, it remained to demonstrate that corin is indeed the endogenous pro-ANP convertase in cardiomyocytes. In this study, we examined pro-ANP processing in a murine cardiac muscle cell line, HL-5. Northern analysis showed that corin mRNA was present in HL-5 cells. In HL-5 cells transfected with a plasmid expressing pro-ANP, recombinant pro-ANP was converted to mature ANP as determined by Western analysis, indicating the presence of the endogenous pro-ANP convertase in these cells. The processed recombinant ANP was shown to be active in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based cGMP assay in baby hamster kidney cells. The processing of recombinant pro-ANP in HL-5 cells was highly sequence-specific, because mutation R98A, but not mutations R101A and R102A, in pro-ANP prevented the conversion of pro-ANP to ANP. Expression of recombinant wild-type corin enhanced the processing of pro-ANP in HL-5 cells. In contrast, overexpression of active site mutant corin S985A or transfection of oligonucleotide small interfering RNA duplexes directed against the mouse corin gene completely inhibited the processing of recombinant pro-ANP in HL-5 cells.

In response to high blood pressure, ANP is secreted into the circulation. In target organs such as kidney and peripheral vessels, ANP binds to its receptor and stimulates the intrinsic guanylyl cyclase activity of the receptor, leading to production of intracellular cGMP. The biological effects of ANP are to promote salt excretion, reduce blood volume, and relax vessel tension, thereby reducing blood pressure (1.Levin E.R. Gardner D.G. Samson W.K. N. Engl. J.

The biological importance of the ANP-mediated pathway in maintaining normal blood pressure has been demonstrated in a number of studies. In knockout mice, for example, deficiency in either ANP or its receptor led to spontaneous hypertension (3.John S.W. Krege J.H. Oliver P.M. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B. Pang S.C. Flynn T.G. Smithies O.

The levels of these natriuretic peptides are often correlated with the extent of ventricular dysfunction and development of cardiac arrhythmias (5.Burnett Jr., J.C. Kao P.C. Hu D.C. Heser D.W.

After the signal peptide is removed, pro-ANP is stored in the dense granules of the cell. Upon secretion from the dense granules, pro-ANP is activated on the surface of cardiac myocytes by proteolytic cleavage at residue arginine 98, generating an N-terminal propeptide and a mature 26-amino acid C-terminal peptide that is biologically active (12.Shields P.P.

Several studies showed that a high-molecular-weight trypsin-like enzyme associated with the membrane of cardiac myocytes was responsible for the activation cleavage of pro-ANP (14.Seidah N.G.

Sequence analysis indicates that corin is a mosaic protein composed of a distinctive assortment of domains. At its N terminus, corin has a cytoplasmic domain and an integral transmembrane domain. In the extracellular region of corin, there are two frizzled-like cysteine-rich motifs, eight low density lipoprotein receptor repeats, a macrophage scavenger receptor-like domain, and a trypsin-like protease domain at the C terminus (17.Yan W.

The overall topology of corin is similar to those of other type II transmembrane serine proteases of the trypsin superfamily (19.Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol.

In a functional study using transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, we showed that recombinant human corin converted pro-ANP to ANP, suggesting that corin is likely the long-sought pro-ANP convertase (23.Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate that corin is indeed the endogenous enzyme responsible for the processing of pro-ANP in cardiac myocytes, we studied pro-ANP processing in a murine cardiac myocytic cell line, HL-5. Here we show that expression of recombinant human wild-type corin enhanced the processing of pro-ANP in HL-5 cells. In contrast, overexpression of active site mutant corin S985A or transfection of oligonucleotide siRNA duplexes directed against the mousecorin gene completely blocked the processing of pro-ANP. These results strongly support corin being the physiological pro-ANP convertase in the heart.

The murine cardiac myocytic cell line HL-5 was kindly provided by Dr. William C. Claycomb (Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA).

Human 293 cells were cultured in α-MEM (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% l-glutamine. BHK cells were cultured in MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified incubators with 5% CO2 and 95% air. To examine cardiac-specific gene expression in HL-5 cells, mRNA was isolated from HL-5 cells using a commercial mRNA preparation kit (Micro-Fast Track 2.0 mRNA isolation kit, Invitrogen). RT-PCR reactions were carried out using the One-Step RT-PCR Advantage Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with 30 cycles of amplification (30-s annealing at 65 °C, 1-min extension at 68 °C, and 30-s denaturation at 94 °C).

Poly(A)+ RNA samples from mouse heart and lung were purchased from CLONTECH. mRNA from HL-5 cells was isolated using the Micro-Fast Track 2.0 mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). RNA samples (2.5 μg each) were fractionated on denaturing agarose gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Northern hybridization was performed with a32P-labeled mouse corin cDNA probe at 42 °C overnight in a solution containing 40% formamide, 5% Denhardt's solution, 6× SSC, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.1% SDS. As a control for mRNA sample loading, Northern blots were reprobed with a mouse β-actin cDNA probe (CLONTECH). Plasmid constructs expressing human wild-type corin (pcDNACorin), active site mutant corin S985A (pcDNACorinS985A), human wild-type pro-ANP (pcDNAproANP), and mutant pro-ANPs R101A (pcDNAproANPR101A) and R102A (pcDNAproANPR102A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and described previously (23.Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing active site mutant prothrombin S205A (pPTS205A) and active site mutant hepsin S353A (pHepsinS353A) were generated by a PCR-based mutagenesis method. Plasmid pcDNAproANPR98A expressing mutant pro-ANP R98A, in which residue Arg-98 was replaced by Ala, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with sense primer 5′-ATCTGCCCTCCTAAAAAGCAA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GATCTCCGCAGGCTCGGCAGGGGCAGTGAGCAG-3′. To facilitate detection of recombinant proteins, a tag sequence was included in the constructs that expresses a viral V5 and a His tag at the C terminus of recombinant pro-ANP. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection was performed in HL-5 or 293 cells using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conditioned medium was collected 48 or 72 h after transfection. To analyze pro-ANP processing, recombinant pro-ANP and its derivatives in the conditioned medium were immunoprecipitated by an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). To examine the activity of recombinant ANP, a cGMP assay was performed using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Biotrak, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). In this assay, BHK cells were grown in 96-well plates in MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% of l-glutamine. Confluent cells were washed once with serum-free medium. The conditioned medium (180 μl) containing recombinant pro-ANP and its derivatives from transfected HL-5 or 293 cells was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were lysed by addition of a lysis buffer (20 μl/well) containing 2% dodecyl trimethylammonium and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8. The intracellular cGMP concentration in ANP-stimulated BHK cells was determined with the Biotrak EIA kit. Each experimental condition was assayed in quadruplicate. Recombinant pro-ANP was expressed in 293 cells transfected with the pro-ANP-expressing plasmid. The conditioned medium containing recombinant pro-ANP was incubated with HL-5 cells at 37 °C for 4 h in the presence of one of the following: 2.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 20 mg/ml benzamidine, 25 mg/ml leupeptin, or 12.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The conditioned medium was collected, and the processing of pro-ANP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody. Oligonucleotide siRNAs were designed based on sequences specific for mouse corin cDNA (5′-AACCACCGCCCUCCGUGCA-3′ and 5′-AACACAAGCACCUGCAUGAAC-3′) (24.Tomita Y. Kim D.H. Magoori K. Fujino T. Yamamoto T.T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Antisense and sense siRNA oligonucleotides with dTdT 3′-overhang were synthesized and annealed by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of HL-5 and 293 cells with the siRNA duplexes was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, HL-5 cells or 293 cells expressing corin were grown in 24-well cell culture plates. Increasing concentrations of siRNA duplexes were added to a solution containing Oligofectamine (3 μl) and Opti-MEM (100 μl) (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 25 min. The mixture was then added to HL-5 or 293 cells and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and then incubated with the conditioned medium containing recombinant pro-ANP at 37 °C for 4 h. Pro-ANP and its derivatives in the conditioned medium were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The murine HL-5 cell line was derived from the AT-1 atrial cardiomyocyte tumor lineage developed in transgenic mice overexpressing simian virus 40 large T antigen under the control of the ANP promoter (29.Field L.J. Science. 1988; 239: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 30.Borisov A.B. Claycomb W.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 752: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The AT-1 cells were maintained by serial subcutaneous grafts in C57BL/6J mice and used to establish cardiac muscle cell lines that are stable under culture conditions. Previous studies showed that a similar cell line, HL-1, derived from the same AT-1 tumor lineage, exhibited electrophysiological and pharmacological features that were characteristic of adult cardiac myocytes (31.Claycomb W.C. Lanson Jr., N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A. Izzo Jr., N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). To determine if HL-5 cells also maintain a cardiac-specific gene expression profile, the expression of a set of selected cardiac-specific genes was examined by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1, transcripts of the ANP, α-MHC, connexin43, and α-cardiac actin genes were detected in RNA samples from HL-5 cells and the adult mouse heart. By Northern hybridization (Fig. 2), a corin transcript of ∼5 kb was detected in mRNA samples from HL-5 cells and the adult heart. In contrast, ANP, α-MHC, connexin43, α-cardiac actin, and corin mRNAs were not detected in samples from the mouse lung by the RT-PCR or Northern analyses. As a control, α-skeletal actin mRNA was detected in samples from the lung but not HL-5 cells and the heart (Figs. 1 and 2). These results are consistent with the previous report that the AT-1 tumor-derived cells maintain characteristics of adult atrial cardiomyocytes (31.Claycomb W.C. Lanson Jr., N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A. Izzo Jr., N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Northern blots were prepared using mRNA samples derived from HL-5 cells or mouse heart and lung tissues, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Northern hybridization was performed with a mouse corin cDNA probe. Corin mRNA was detected in samples from HL-5 cells and the heart but not the lung (upper panel). As a control, the blot was re-probed with a mouse actin probe. Actin mRNA was detected in all three samples (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the processing of pro-ANP in HL-5 cells, transfection studies were performed using plasmids expressing human pro-ANP and corin. As reported in our previous study (23.Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and shown here as a control (Fig. 3 A), processing of recombinant pro-ANP to ANP in 293 cells was not detected unless a corin-expressing plasmid was co-transfected with the pro-ANP-expressing plasmid. In contrast, in HL-5 cells co-transfection of the corin-expressing plasmid was not required for the conversion of recombinant pro-ANP to ANP. Processing of pro-ANP was detected in HL-5 cells transfected with only the pro-ANP-expressing plasmid (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that recombinant pro-ANP was processed by endogenous corin present in HL-5 but not 293 cells. Expression of recombinant corin further enhanced the processing of pro-ANP in HL-5 cells, as shown in Fig. 3 B, when the HL-5 cells were co-transfected with the corin-expressing plasmid. In a separate experiment, recombinant pro-ANP was incubated with either HL-5 cells or transfected 293 cells expressing recombinant corin. Western analysis showed similar processing of recombinant pro-ANP by both cell types (Fig. 3 C). These results are consistent with the previous findings that corin is a transmembrane protease present on the surface of cardiac myocytes (18.Hooper J.D. Scarman A.L. Clarke B.E. Normyle J.F. Antalis T.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6931-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23.Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The biological function of ANP is mediated through its receptor that is present on the surface of targeted cells. The binding of ANP to its receptor stimulates the intrinsic guanylyl cyclase activity of the receptor, leading to generation of intracellular cGMP. To determine if the corin-processed recombinant ANP is biologically active, a cell-based cGMP assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 4, cGMP-stimulating activity was detected in the conditioned medium from 293 cells transfected with both corin and pro-ANP-expressing plasmids. In contrast, little cGMP-stimulating activity was detected in the conditioned medium from 293 cells transfected with either corin or pro-ANP-expressing plasmids alone (Fig. 4). In a parallel study, low levels of the cGMP-stimulating activity were detected in the conditioned medium from parental HL-5 cells (Fig. 4). The activity was most likely due to the presence of native ANP produced in HL-5 cells being processed by the native corin. The cGMP-stimulating activity was significantly increased in the conditioned medium from HL-5 cells transfected with corin and pro-ANP-expressing plasmids, either independently or simultaneously (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the Western analysis of the processing of recombinant pro-ANP in 293 and HL-5 cells (Fig. 3), and demonstrate that corin-processed recombinant ANP is biologically active. In the heart, pro-ANP is processed by proteolytic cleavage at residue Arg-98, generating a 28-amino acid mature C-terminal peptide that is the major circulating form of ANP. In other tissues, including brain, kidney, and testis, proteolytic cleavage of pro-ANP can occur at other residues such as Arg-101 and Arg-102 (32.Pandey K.N. Orgebin-Crist M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33.Shiono S. Nakao K. Morii N. Yamada T. Itoh H. Sakamoto M. Sugawara A. Saito Y. Katsuura G. Imura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 728-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Earlier we had shown that corin specifically cleaved pro-ANP at residue Arg-98 in transfected 293 cells (23.Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). To determine if pro-ANP is also processed at Arg-98 in HL-5 cells, transfection experiments were performed in HL-5 cells using plasmids expressing human wild-type and mutant pro-ANPs. Recombinant pro-ANP and its derivatives in the conditioned medium were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5, recombinant wild-type pro-ANP and mutant pro-ANPs R101A and R102A were processed in HL-5 cells. In contrast, no cleavage was detected when mutant pro-ANP R98A was expressed in HL-5 cells, indicating that mutation at Arg-98 prevented specific processing of pro-ANP by endogenous corin in the cardiac myocytes. Previous studies showed that the processing of pro-ANP by a partially purified protease present in membrane fractions from cardiac myocytes was inhibited by high concentrations (100 mg/ml) of benzamidine, leupeptin, and aprotinin but not soybean trypsin inhibitor (15.Imada T. Takayanagi R. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9515-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar effects of the protease inhibitors were observed on recombinant corin-mediated processing of pro-ANP in 293 cells (23.Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). To examine effects of the protease inhibitors on the processing of pro-ANP in HL-5 cells, recombinant pro-ANP was incubated with HL-5 cells in the presence of these protease inhibitors. Western analysis showed that benzamidine, leupeptin, and aprotinin but not soybean trypsin inhibitor inhibited the processing of pro-ANP by HL-5 cells (Fig. 6). The results further support the hypothesis that corin is the endogenous pro-ANP convertase in the cardiac myocytes. If corin is indeed the endogenous pro-ANP convertase, it may be possible to inhibit corin-mediated pro-ANP processing in HL-5 cells by overexpression of active site mutant corin S985A, in which the active site serine residue has been replaced by Ala. To test this hypothesis, an experiment was performed in which plasmids expressing pro-ANP and mutant corin S985A were co-transfected in HL-5 cells. As shown in Fig. 7, the processing of recombinant pro-ANP was inhibited when HL-5 cells were co-transfected with increasing concentrations of the plasmid expressing mutant corin S985A. In controls, co-transfection of plasmids expressing active site mutant human hepsin S353A or active site mutant human prothrombin S205A did not inhibit the processing of recombinant pro-ANP in HL-5 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that active site mutant corin S985A competed with endogenous corin, thereby inhibiting the processing of recombinant pro-ANP in HL-5 cells. To further demonstrate the requirement of corin for the pro-ANP processing in cardiac myocytes, we used the RNA interference (RNAi) technique to block endogenous corin expression in HL-5 cells. This powerful oligonucleotide siRNA-mediated gene-silencing technique has been used successfully to prevent gene expression in cultured mammalian cells (34.Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar). In HL-5 cells, co-transfection of the plasmid expressing pro-ANP with increasing concentrations of oligonucleotide siRNA duplexes directed specifically against the mousecorin gene inhibited the pro-ANP processing in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8). In contrast, the siRNA duplexes had no inhibitory effects on the pro-ANP processing in 293 cells expressing recombinant human corin, demonstrating the sequence specificity of the siRNA duplexes (Fig. 8). Although we were unable to verify the down-regulation of mouse corin protein expression in the transfected HL-5 cells due to lack of antibodies against mouse corin, these results are consistent with the notion that inhibition of endogenous corin expression prevented the pro-ANP processing in the cardiac myocyte. Proteolytic cleavage of propeptides is a fundamental process in the activation of polypeptide hormones. For most of the peptide hormones, the activation cleavage is mediated by a family of subtilisin-like serine proteases, known as precursor convertases (PCs). These convertases are located in the secretory pathway inside of the cell and cleave proproteins at specific sequences commonly composed of single or paired basic amino acids (35.Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 36.Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Processing of pro-ANP, however, appears to be mediated by a different mechanism. Following removal of its signal peptide, pro-ANP is stored in the dense granules of cardiac myocytes. The activation cleavage occurs on the cell surface when the pro-hormone is secreted from the cells. Earlier biochemical studies have indicated that a high-molecular-weight trypsin-like protease present on the cell surface is responsible for the processing of pro-ANP in cardiac myocytes (14.Seidah N.G. Cromlish J.A. Hamelin J. Thibault G. Chretien M. Biosci. Rep. 1986; 6: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15.Imada T. Takayanagi R. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9515-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Sei C.A. Hand G.L. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 309-319PubMed Google Scholar). Our discovery of the cardiac transmembrane serine protease, corin, and subsequent characterization of its function indicate that corin is probably the pro-ANP convertase. Corin mRNA was detected in tissues such as heart, kidney, testis, uterus, and bone where pro-ANP and other natriuretic peptides are known to be expressed (17.Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies showed that the corin protein had a molecular mass of ∼150 kDa and was associated with the cell membrane (23.Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In transfected 293 cells, recombinant corin cleaved pro-ANP to produce a small peptide that was indistinguishable from the mature ANP by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. Mutagenesis analysis showed that the corin-mediated cleavage of pro-ANP was highly sequence-specific. It remained, however, to show that corin is indeed the endogenous pro-ANP convertase in cardiac myocytes, because other serine proteases such as thrombin and kallikrein have also been reported in the past to cleave pro-ANPin vitro (37.Corthorn J. Cantin M. Thibault G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 103: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 38.Moreau T. Brillard-Bourdet M. Chagas J. Gauthier F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized the corin-mediated pro-ANP processing in a murine cardiac myocyte cell line, HL-5, that was derived from the murine AT-1 atrial cardiomyocyte tumor lineage. Previous studies have shown that AT-1-derived cells maintain a cardiac-specific phenotype (31.Claycomb W.C. Lanson Jr., N.A. Stallworth B.S. Egeland D.B. Delcarpio J.B. Bahinski A. Izzo Jr., N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). AT-1-derived cells, for example, exhibit a gene expression pattern that is very similar to that of adult atrial cardiac myocytes. AT-1-derived cells possess pro-ANP-containing dense granules and are capable of processing the prohormone when it is secreted from the cells. In RT-PCR and Northern analyses (Figs. 1 and2), we showed that both corin and pro-ANP genes were expressed in HL-5 cells. In a cell-based cGMP assay, ANP activity was detected in the conditioned medium derived from HL-5 cells (Fig. 4), demonstrating endogenous processing of pro-ANP and constitutive secretion of active ANP from these cells. These results indicate that HL-5 cells are an excellent model for studying the role of corin in pro-ANP processing in cardiac myocytes. In transfection studies, we showed that recombinant pro-ANP was processed by an endogenous enzyme present in HL-5 cells. Characteristically, the processing of pro-ANP in HL-5 cells was indistinguishable from the corin-mediated processing of pro-ANP in 293 cells. In both cell types, for example, the proteolytic activity was present on the cell surface (Fig. 3 C), the cleavage in pro-ANP was sequence-specific (Fig. 5), and serine protease inhibitors had similar effects (Fig. 6). We also showed that transfection of a plasmid expressing corin enhanced pro-ANP processing in HL-5 cells and that the corin-processed ANP was biologically active as measured in a cell-based cGMP assay (Fig. 4). Moreover, overexpression of the active site mutant of corin S985A in HL-5 cells completely prevented the pro-ANP processing in HL-5 cells (Fig. 7). The dominant effect of mutant corin S985A in HL-5 cells appeared to be specific, because expression of two other active site mutant trypsin-like serine proteases, hepsin S353A and prothrombin S205A, did not inhibit the pro-ANP processing in HL-5 cells. In RNAi-mediated gene silencing experiments, oligonucleotide siRNA duplexes directed against the mousecorin gene inhibited the pro-ANP processing in HL-5 cells (Fig. 8). The specificity of the oligonucleotide siRNA duplexes for mouse corin and not for other sequences was demonstrated by the lack of effect on pro-ANP conversion in 293 cells expressing human corin (Fig. 8). Together, these results strongly indicate that corin is the physiological pro-ANP convertase in cardiac myocytes. At the present time, the mechanism by which mutant corin S985A exhibited its dominant negative effect in HL-5 cells is not known, but several mechanistic possibilities exist. It is unlikely that the inhibitory effect of mutant corin S985A was caused by dimerization with the endogenous corin, because there was no evidence in Western analysis that corin formed dimers (23.Yan W. Wu F. Morser J. Wu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Similarly, competition for occupancy of a limited number of sites in the plasma membrane is possible but unlikely. A more plausible mechanism is that the mutant corin may compete with the endogenous corin for substrate binding through either its protease domain or its distinct motifs in the propeptide domain such as frizzled-like cysteine-rich motifs, low density lipoprotein receptor repeats and macrophage scavenger receptor-like domain. The frizzled-, low density lipoprotein receptor-, and macrophage scavenger receptor-like motifs are known to be important in protein-protein interactions (39.Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar, 40.Brown M.S. Herz J. Goldstein J.L.

In addition to competition for substrate binding, the mutant corin may also compete with the endogenous corin for an activator. The corin amino acid sequence indicates that corin, like most other trypsin-like serine proteases, is synthesized as a zymogen and that a proteolytic cleavage at residue Arg-801 by a trypsin-like enzyme is required for its activation (17.Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). At this time, the identity of such a protease activator is completely unknown. Further study of corin will help to better understand corin-mediated pro-ANP processing and may also lead to discovery of other proteins that regulate corin activity. We thank Dr. W. Dole for his support and encouragement."

To understand the molecular basis of the Csk-mediated regulation of SFKs, we elucidated the crystal structure of full-length Csk. The Csk crystal consists of six molecules classified as active or inactive states according to the coordinations of catalytic residues. Csk assembles the SH2 and SH3 domains differently from inactive SFKs, and their binding pockets are oriented outward enabling the intermolecular interaction. In active molecules, the SH2-kinase and SH2-SH3 linkers are tightly stuck to the N-lobe of the kinase domain to stabilize the active conformation, and there is a direct linkage between the SH2 and the kinase domains. In inactive molecules, the SH2 domains are rotated destroying the linkage to the kinase domain. Cross-correlation matrices for the active molecules reveal that the SH2 domain and the N-lobe of the kinase domain move as a unit.

These observations suggest that Csk can be regulated through coupling of the SH2 and kinase domains and that Csk provides a novel built-in activation mechanism for cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. The Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), 1The abbreviations used are: SFKSrc family tyrosine kinasePTKprotein tyrosine kinase benign relatives of the oncogenic v-src gene product, are non-receptor types of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that are associated with the plasma membrane through their fatty acylated N termini (1.Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The SFKs serve as molecular switches involved in the initiation of a variety of cellular events in the multicellular animals, including cell growth and division, cell attachment and movement, differentiation, survival, and death (2.Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). The SFKs are ordinarily present in an inactive state in which the phosphorylated C-terminal regulatory tyrosine binds to its own SH2 domain (3.Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). In response to an external stimulus, an SFK becomes activated through dephosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine or through binding to another protein that displaces the intramolecular interaction. The phosphorylation of the regulatory tyrosine of SFK is strictly controlled by another PTK, the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) (4.Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar,5.Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The loss-of-function of Csk leads to constitutive activation of SFKs, accompanied by severe defects in embryonic development (5.Nada S. Yagi T. Takeda H. Tokunaga T. Nakagawa H. Ikawa Y. Okada M. Aizawa S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1125-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In contrast, gain-of-function of Csk can readily down-regulate SFK-mediated cell signaling (6.Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand the function and regulation of SFKs, it is essential to clarify the regulation mechanism controlling the phosphorylation of the critical C-terminal tyrosine. Src family tyrosine kinase protein tyrosine kinase Csk is a cytoplasmic PTK consisting of an SH3, an SH2, and a kinase domain (4.Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Because it lacks an N-terminal acylation signal, an autophosphorylation site, and a C-terminal regulatory tyrosine, all of which are conserved among SFKs, the regulatory mechanism of Csk appears to be quite different from those of SFKs. The molecular basis of Csk regulation has so far been studied using mutated molecules and isolated domains (7.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8.Shekhtman A. Ghose R. Wang D. Cole P.A. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, lack of the entire structure of Csk has hampered the evaluation of their physiological roles. Some evidence suggests that the SH2 and/or SH3 domain of Csk is essential for SFK regulation (7.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 9.Cloutier J.F. Chow J.M. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that recruitment to the membrane is required for Csk function (6.Chow L.M. Fournel M. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nature. 1993; 365: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 10.Howell B.W. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5402-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this context, we and others have recently identified a membrane phosphoprotein that can tightly bind to the SH2 domain of Csk (Cbp or PAG) (11.Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 12.Brdicka T. Pavlistova D. Leo A. Bruyns E. Korinek V. Angelisova P. Scherer J. Shevchenko A. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Drbal K. Kuramitsu Y. Kornacker B. Horejsi V. Schraven B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, Cbp/PAG can recruit Csk to a membrane microdomain, so-called lipid Rafts, to terminate SFK signaling. More recently, we found that the binding to the phosphorylated Cbp/PAG could directly activate Csk (13.Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that Cbp/PAG plays an important role in Csk regulation. On the other hand, other proteins that could functionally bind to the SH2 domain of Csk, such as Paxillin and FAK, have been identified previously (7.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Csk is regulated through its SH2 domain in vivo, although the molecular basis of this regulation remains thoroughly unknown. To address this issue, we here elucidated the entire structure of Csk by crystallographic analysis. The full-length (amino acids 1–450) rat Csk was expressed using baculovirus vector in insect cells and purified essentially by the same methods as described previously (13.Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), except that β-octyl-d-glucoside was added (instead of Nonidet P-40) to the buffer during chromatography processes and that the final gel filtration chromatography was performed in a buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.02% β-octyl-d-glucoside. Size estimation was carried out on a Superdex200 HR10/30 column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Sedimentation equilibrium was performed by ultracentrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 22 h. Concentration distributions were measured using the Rayleigh interference optics. The purified Csk was concentrated to ∼12 mg/ml, mixed with 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) containing 1.90–1.95 m ammonium sulfate, and crystallized in a sitting drop by vapor diffusion at 288 K for 1–2 months. All data were collected at the cryogenic temperature (around 100 K) using 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. The native1, native2, and Hg data were collected on the PX210 (Oxford) at BL44XU, Quantum4 (adsc) at BL40B2, and on the marCCD (Mar research) at BL41XU in SPring-8, respectively. The diffraction images were reduced and scaled with Mosflm (ccp4 (14.Collaborative Computing Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar)) and Scala (ccp4) in native1 and Denzo/Scalepack (15.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) in native2 and Hg data sets. The intensities were converted to the structure factor amplitudes with TRUNCATE (ccp4). Subsequent phasing calculations were performed using native2 and Hg data. The six Hg positions were first located using SHELXS-97 (16.Sheldrick G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 628-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), followed by the minor site specification, heavy atom parameter refinement, and the SIRAS phase calculation with SHARP (17.de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The density modification with SOLOMON (ccp4) permitted us clear interpretation of the electron density map. The atomic model was built using O (18.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and refined with the native1 data set using CNS (19.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Of the 2,298 non-glycine and non-proline residues, 83.0% fell into the most favored regions, 16.1% into the additional allowed regions, 0.9% into the generously allowed regions, and no residue into the disallowed regions of Ramachandran plot as defined in PROCHECK. Coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1K9A. The full-length rat Csk was produced using a baculovirus vector in insect cells and purified through sequential column chromatography. Although Csk from the brain tissue (<0.01 mg/ml) behaved as a monomer (50 kDa) on gel filtration chromatography (20.Okada M. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20886-20893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the highly concentrated Csk from insect cells (>1 mg/ml) was eluted with an apparent molecular size around 100 kDa (data not shown). Sedimentation equilibrium analysis also revealed that Csk is present as a dimer at concentrations around 1 mg/ml (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that Csk tends to dimerize at high protein concentrations in vitro. The crystal structure of Csk was solved by the heavy atom single isomorphous replacement method. Crystallographic data and refinement statistics are shown in Table I. An interesting feature of Csk crystal is that it consists of six molecules divided into three pairs of putative dimers per asymmetric unit. This is probably because of oligomerization of Csk dimers during crystallization processes. The dimers are made with loose interactions through the backside of the kinase domains and the SH3 domains. Two of the six molecules, in distinct dimers, make further contact with each other and appear to have some distortions in their structures as described later. In every molecule, however, the three functional domains, SH2, SH3, and kinase, are arranged in a similar manner with the SH2 and SH3 domains diametrically opposite on the top of the N-lobe of the kinase domain (Fig. 1, A and C). Although the position of the SH3 domain resembles the position of the SH3 domain of inactive forms of SFKs, the position of the SH2 domain is entirely different (3.Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). In addition, there is no direct contact between the SH2 and SH3 domains of Csk.Table ISummery of crystallographic data and refinement statisticsNative1Native2CH3HgBrSpace groupP212121Cell parameters a (Å)115.0115.0115.1 b (Å)162.6162.6162.9 c(Å)232.4232.4232.5Wavelength (Å)0.9001.0001.007Resolution range1-aValues in parentheses are for the last resolution shell.(Å)73–2.5 (2.64–2.50)30–2.6 (2.69–2.60)49–2.9 (3.0–2.9)Number of unique reflections1-aValues in parentheses are for the last resolution shell.150,489 (17,029)136,322 (13,573)93,131 (9,172)Completeness1-aValues in parentheses are for the last resolution shell.98.2 (98.2)99.4 (99.9)99.9 (98.8)Multiplicity1-aValues in parentheses are for the last resolution shell.5.0 (4.5)5.2 (4.9)5.9 (5.1)I/ς1-aValues in parentheses are for the last resolution shell.6.9 (1.7)8.812.1R sym1-aValues in parentheses are for the last resolution shell.(%)7.3 (39.8)5.9 (39.0)6.9 (36.2)R cryst/R free(%)24.6/28.8Root mean square deviationBond lengths (Å)0.007Bond angles (°)1.4271-a Values in parentheses are for the last resolution shell. Open table in a new tab The SH3 domains fold canonically with two anti-parallel sheets of five β-strands sandwiched into a compact structure. There are virtually no differences from the structure of an isolated Csk-SH3 domain (21.Borchert T.V. Mathieu M. Zeelen J.P. Courtneidge S.A. Wierenga R.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) except that the N-terminal region is disordered in the isolated SH3 domain (Fig. 1 A). The peptide-binding pocket of the SH3 domain is oriented outward (Fig. 1 C) enabling the intermolecular interaction, and the interactions between the SH3 and SH2-kinase linker observed in inactive SFK structures are absent. The SH2 domains are also canonical, consisting of a central β-sheet flanked by two α-helices as in c-Src (Fig. 1 A), although an insertion is present in the loop region of the c-Src SH2 domain. However, a significant difference can be observed in the orientations of the SH2 domains when all six Csk molecules are superimposed (Fig. 1 B). In four Csk molecules, the ligand binding surfaces face to the left in Fig. 1 B, whereas those of the other two are rotated upward ∼60° (Fig. 1 B). This disorientation may reflect an unusual flexibility of the SH3-SH2 linker and SH2-kinase linker, which form a hinge about which the SH2 domain pivots. These two linkers make extensive hydrophobic contacts with the N-lobe of the kinase domain (Fig. 1 A and Fig. 3). In the SH2-kinase linker, there is an α-helix, which is designated as αBC, that is absent from SFKs (Fig. 1 A). All the hydrophobic residues involved in engaging the SH2 and kinase domains are highly conserved among Csks derived from various species, suggesting that docking of the SH2 linkers into the kinase domain is important for regulation. The kinase domains of the four Csk molecules whose SH2 domains face to the leftin Fig. 1 B can be readily superimposed on the kinase domain of an active SFK, Lck (22.Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The positions of residues crucial for catalytic activity (Asp-314, Asn-319, and Asp-332) and the critical ion bridge that orients the γ-phosphate of ATP (Glu-236 in αC and Lys-222 in β3) are consistent with those of Lck (Fig. 2, A and B). All these features suggest that the four molecules are most likely to be enzymatically active. The active site similarity with Lck is rather remarkable considering that Csk differs from SFKs in its activation loop (Fig. 2, red). The activation loop of Csk (331–348) is four residues shorter than and diverged from that of Lck, and, critically, it lacks a phosphorylated tyrosine residue (Fig. 2 E). In addition, Csk residues are either substantially displaced as compared with their counterparts in Lck (338–342, 346–349) or disordered (343–345). In SFKs, autophosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine is regulatory and essential for full catalytic activity and for transforming potential (23.Gonfloni S. Weijland A. Kretzschmar J. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24.Sun G. Ramdas L. Wang W. Vinci J. McMurray J. Budde R.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In Lck, this phosphotyrosine (Tyr-394) is essential to coordinate Arg-363 and Arg-387 and thus stabilize the active structure. In Csk, however, the side chain of Lys-337, which corresponds to Arg-387 in Lck, has no apparent coordinations to a specific partner, yet the main chain lies within 1.5 Å of Lck Arg-337 when the C-lobes are superimposed. The similarity in active sites despite the absence of phosphate in the activation loop suggests that another mechanism maintains the active conformation of Csk. Previously it has been reported that deletion of sequences preceding the kinase domain significantly reduces Csk activity (7.Sabe H. Hata A. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8.Shekhtman A. Ghose R. Wang D. Cole P.A. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25.Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11147-11155Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26.Sun G. Budde R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and a role of the SH3-SH2 linker in Csk activation has been suggested (8.Shekhtman A. Ghose R. Wang D. Cole P.A. Cowburn D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a structure of the isolated kinase domain bound to staurosporine, the helix αC is kinked and flexible, destroying the critical salt bridge between Lys-222 and Glu-236 (Fig. 2 D) (27.Lamers M.B. Antson A.A. Hubbard R.E. Scott R.K. Williams D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the case of Lck, however, an isolated kinase domain retains full activity (28.Zhu X. Kim J.L. Newcomb J.R. Rose P.E. Stover D.R. Toledo L.M. Zao H. Morqenstern K.A. Structure Fold Des. 1999; 7: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (253) Google Scholar). As already mentioned, in Csk there are tight interactions between the two linkers and the N-lobe of the kinase domain. Notably, the helix αC, which positions Glu-236, is oriented by extensive contacts with the linkers (Fig. 3). This resembles the case of CDK2 that is partially activated through binding to cyclin A (29.Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massaque J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). The binding of cyclin A to the helix αC (containing PSTAIRE motif) of CDK2 induces a dramatic change in the orientation of the helix αC so that the catalytic residues are appropriately coordinated for the catalysis. Therefore, instead of the activating phosphotyrosine, Csk may require the interaction between the kinase domain and the linkers to stabilize the active conformation. In contrast with the active molecules, the two Csk molecules with rotated SH2 domains appear to be inactive. These molecules are substantially different from the active molecules in the backbone carbon positions of the N-lobe of the kinase domain (Fig. 1 B). Importantly, the critical ion pair (between Glu-236 and Lys-222) is absent (Fig. 2 C) although the conformation of the catalytic domain is apparently different from that of the isolated kinase domain bound to staurosporine (27.Lamers M.B. Antson A.A. Hubbard R.E. Scott R.K. Williams D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is a major difference between the active and inactive molecules in the SH2-kinase interface (Fig. 3); the interactions between the βD-βE loop of the SH2 domain and β3-αC loop in the N-lobe of kinase domain are absent in the inactive molecules. These indicate that rotation of the SH2 domain could affect the conformation of the N-lobe of the kinase domain, implicating the functional relationship between the SH2 domain and the kinase domain. To address the above issue, we calculated cross-correlation matrices for the deviations of the backbone carbon atoms of the molecules in the crystal. The cross-correlation matrix was recently found to be useful to assess interdomain interactions in molecular dynamics studies (30.Young M.A. Gonfloni S. Superti-Furga G. Roux B. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 105: 115-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Fortunately, our crystal contained multiple copies of Csk molecules in an asymmetric unit, and we used four crystallographically independent copies instead of conformational snapshots in the molecular dynamics study. The C-lobes of the kinase domains were first superimposed by the program LSQKAB (14.Collaborative Computing Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), and then we generated a set of averaged positions of the α carbon. The correlation between two atoms can be defined using the deviations from their respective average positions. It is obvious that the correlation value for two atoms in the same domain shows an absolute value close to 1 as the domain moves en bloc. If two residues move independently, the correlation will be near 0. It is usually observed that the correlation between two atoms in the “superimposed” region is flattened to 0. As shown in Fig. 4, for four active-state molecules, clusters of positive correlations between two atoms lie in the regions indicating correlations between the SH2 domain and β1-β2 and β3-αC regions of the kinase domain. This indicates that these segments deviate en bloc in the crystal, representing a functional coupling between the SH2 and the kinase domain. The structure of Csk presented here highlights the functional interactions of the catalytic domain with the SH2 domain and its linkers and suggests a novel activation mechanism that is distinct from the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of SFKs. The presence of an inactive conformation of Csk, which is probably produced by the unusual flexibility of the hinge region of the SH2 domain, also suggests that there may be a dynamic equilibrium between active and inactive Csk. It is known that a strong ligand of the SH2 domain, the phosphorylated Cbp/PAG, could elicit potentially full activity of Csk (13.Takeuchi S. Takayama Y. Ogawa A. Tamura K. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29183-29186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is probable that binding of Cbp/PAG ligand to the SH2 domain could fix the active state to make the kinase constitutively active. It is also possible that the conformation change induced by the SH2 ligand could affect the region responsible for the substrate recognition. To verify these hypotheses, the structural details of Csk association with Cbp/PAG are now under investigation. Among the many types of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, including the Fes, Abl, Syk, Tec, and Csk families, the SFKs are unusual in that they are negatively regulated by phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory site. The SH2 domain of the SFK serves as an acceptor for the phosphorylated regulatory tyrosine. All the aforementioned cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases also possess an SH2 domain adjacent to the catalytic domain but have no C-terminal phosphotyrosine. Although the actual roles of SH2 domains in these enzymes remain to be studied at the molecular level, the structures of Csk presented here could be representative of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases other than SFKs.

Wands J.R. Virology. 1996; 222: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A shorter form of the core protein (p16) with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa has also been reported (11Lo S.Y.

Virology. 1995; 213: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This form was first detected during in vitro expression studies of the prototype HCV-1 isolate and has been largely attributed to a specific Arg-to-Lys mutation in codon 9 of the core coding sequences (11Lo S.Y.

According to recent reports, the core protein interacts with an increasing number of cellular proteins and modulates the expression of several cellular or viral promoters. Thus, the core protein can either activate or inhibit programmed cell death (16Marusawa H. Hijikata M. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhu N.

Virol. 1998; 72: 3060-3065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, computer-assisted analysis of the HCV genome has revealed the presence of an additional out-of-frame open reading frame (ORF) overlapping the core gene in the +1 frame (24Ina Y. Mizokami M. Ohba K. Gojobori T. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Smith D.B. Simmonds P. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This novel ORF is open for 124–160 codons in most of the HCV strains (25Smith D.B. Simmonds P. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, a putative polypeptide of ∼14–17 kDa could be potentially synthesized by an alternate translation mechanism. Comparison of the complete genome sequences from different variants of HCV has shown a strong conservation within the core coding region at both the amino acid and nucleotide levels (24Ina Y. Mizokami M. Ohba K. Gojobori T. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Smith D.B. Simmonds P. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). More importantly, it has been reported that synonymous substitutions at the third position are highly suppressed in the core coding region (24Ina Y. Mizokami M. Ohba K. Gojobori T. J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 38: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this region lacks an obvious translation start codon, which may help to explain why this sequence conservation was attributed to structural constraints of the viral genome rather than the presence of a functional gene. In the course of experiments involving the construction of chimeric GST-core hybrid proteins, we found that a chimeric GST protein containing mostly HCV sequences encoded by the +1 ORF was reactive to HCV-positive human sera. This construct was the result of a random PCR-induced single nucleotide deletion mutation near the GST-core junction. This prompted us to examine the possibility that this ORF (designated core+1 ORF) represents a functional ORF. To this end, we undertook three different approaches: (a) protein tagging experiments using the luciferase protein as a tag, (b) directly monitoring the expression of the core+1 ORF in vitro with specific anti-core+1 antibodies combined with site-directed mutagenesis experiments, and (c) screening of sera from HCV-infected patients for the presence of circulating anti-core+1 antibodies. From these studies, we provide evidence supporting the expression of the core+1 ORF, at least for some HCV isolates, via novel translation mechanism(s). All plasmids described in this study were constructed by PCR using various primer pairs and the following conditions: 35 cycles at 94 °C for 60 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. For all DNA plasmids described, the DNA sequences were confirmed twice by sequencing (Amersham Biosciences sequencing kit and Applied Biosystems sequencer). Plasmid pHPI-668 is based on the pGEX-3X expression vector (AmershamBiosciences) and was made to express a chimeric GST-core+1 ORF fusion protein. The core coding region (nt 390–920) was obtained by PCR using, as template, p36-27, which contains the prototype HCV-1 cDNA sequence (nt 268–1052) cloned into the pBluescript KS vector (kindly provided by M. Beach). The oligonucleotides 5′-CCGGAATTCCGTAACACCAACCGTCGCCCA-3′ and 5′-CTCGAATTCCACTAGGTAGGCCGAAG-3′ (underlined sequences represent EcoRI sites) were used as sense and antisense primers, respectively. The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and cloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector. Plasmids pHPI-756 and pHPI-996 contain the core coding sequences (nt 341–920) from prototype HCV-1 and HCV-1a (strain H) (kindly provided by G. Inchauspe), respectively, cloned into the pGEM-3zf(+) vector (Promega) under the control of the SP6 promoter. For the construction of pHPI-756, a double-step PCR was performed using plasmid p36-27 as template. The reason for the double-step PCR was to ensure the presence of the 10 consecutive adenine residues at nt 363–372 of the prototype HCV-1 core region, inasmuch as DNA sequencing analysis of this region gave inconclusive results. For the first PCR, we used 5′-GTGCTTGCGAATTCCCCGGGA-3′ as the sense primer and the 5′-ACGTTTGTTTTTTTTTTGAG-3′ as the antisense primer. For this PCR only, different conditions were used: 35 cycles at 94 °C for 60 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 120 s, with a single final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The product of the first PCR was used in the second PCR as the sense primer along with 5′-CTCGAATTCCACTAGGTAGGCCGAAG-3′ as the antisense primer. Plasmid p36-27 was used again as template. The conditions for the second PCR were exactly the same, except that the annealing step was at 62 °C for 30 s. The final PCR product was digested with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI cloning site of the pGEM-3zf(+) vector under the control of the SP6 promoter. Plasmid pHPI-996 was also obtained by PCR using pRc/CMV/HCV-H as template and primers 5′-GTGCTTGCGAATTCCCCGGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCGAATTCCACTAGGTAGGCCGAAG-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was subsequently digested with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI cloning site of the pGEM-3zf(+) vector under the control of the SP6 promoter. Plasmids pHPI-725, pHPI-736, and pHPI-737 contain the luciferase gene fused at the 0, +1, or –1 frame, respectively, with a mutated HCV-1 core coding region (9 A residues). The HCV cDNA sequences encoding the IRES and part of the mutated core coding sequences (nt 9–630) were obtained by PCR using plasmid pHPI-888 as template. The sense primer 5′-CGCCGGATCCTGATGGGGGCGACA-3′ was used for all three plasmids. The antisense primers were 5′-AGACAGGATCCAATCCCGCC-3′ (oligonucleotide A) for pHPI-736, 5′-CACGGGGAGACAGGATCCATCCCGCCCACC-3′ (oligonucleotide B) for pHPI-725, and 5′-CACGGGGAGACAGGATCCACCCGCCCACCC-3′ (oligonucleotide C) for pHPI-737 (underlined sequences represent BamHI sites). The PCR products were digested with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI cloning site of the pGEM-luc vector (Promega). Plasmid pHPI-888 is based on the pGEM-3zf(+) vector and contains cDNA sequences (nt 9–1054) from the prototype HCV-1 isolate. Nucleotide sequence analysis of pHPI-888 revealed the presence of a single nucleotide (A363) deletion in the core coding region. Plasmids pHPI-766, pHPI-767, and pHPI-768 contain the wild-type core coding region (nt 9–630) from the prototype HCV-1 isolate fused to the luciferase gene. As before, to ensure for the presence of the wild-type nucleotide sequences within the nt 363–372 region, we used a double-step PCR cloning approach. For the first PCR, plasmid pHPI-888 was used as template, and oligonucleotides 5′-AGTGTTGGGTCGCGAAAGGCC-3′ (the NruI site located at nt 271 of the 5′-untranslated region is underlined) and 5′-ACGTTTGTTTTTTTTTTGAG-3′ were used as sense and antisense primers, respectively. Subsequently, the PCR product was used as the sense primer, and oligonucleotide 5′-CCAAGGGTACCCGGGCTGAG-3′ (the KpnI site located at nt 585 in the core coding region is underlined) was used as the antisense primer for the second PCR. The template was again plasmid pHPI-888. The PCR product of the second PCR was digested with NruI and KpnI and used to replace the corresponding sequences from plasmid pHPI-736, yielding pHPI-766. Plasmids pHPI-767 and pHPI-768 were made by replacing the ScaI -KpnI fragment (ScaI is a vector site located 5′ to the HCV sequences) of the pHPI-725 or pHPI-737 plasmid with the corresponding sequences from pHPI-766. Plasmids pHPI-748, pHPI-749, and pHPI-750 contain the entire IRES and part of the core coding sequences (nt 9–630) from the HCV-1a (H) strain fused to the luciferase gene in all three frames. Cloning was performed by PCR using oligonucleotide 5′-CGCCGGATCCTGATGGGGGCGACA-3′ as the sense primer and oligonucleotide A (for pHPI-748), oligonucleotide B for (pHPI-749), and oligonucleotide C (for pHPI-750) as the antisense primers. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI cloning site of the pGEM-luc vector. Plasmid pHPI-1309 contains the core coding sequences (nt 385–920) from the prototype HCV-1 isolate with a start codon in the +1 frame. The core coding region was obtained by PCR using pHPI-755 as template and primers 5′-CCGGAATTCGTAATG CCAACCGTCGCCCACAGGACGTCAAGTTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCGAATTCCACTTA GTAGGCCGAAGC-3′ (antisense) (underlined sequences represent the EcoRI sites, and the AUG start codon and the TTA stop codon are in boldface). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM-3zf(+) under the control of the SP6 promoter. Finally, plasmid pHPI-CS contains codons 1–18 of the HCV core sequence cloned into the Hin dIII-BamHI sites of the pGEM-3zf(+) vector under the control of the SP6 promoter. For the cloning, the following two primers were used: sense primer C1s, 5′-AGCTTATGAGCACGAATCCTAAACCTCAAAAAAAAAACAAACGTAACACCAACCGTCG-3′; and antisense primer C2s, 5′-GATCCGCGACGGTTGGTGTTACGTTTGTTTTTTTTTTGAGGTTTAGGATTCGTGCTCATA-3′. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and plasmid pHPI-755 as template. The pHPI-755 plasmid contains the HCV-1 core coding sequences (nt 341–920) cloned into the EcoRI cloning site of the pGEM-3zf(+) vector under the control of the T7 promoter. Plasmid pHPI-774 is a product of site-directed mutagenesis at nt 342 and 343 of the prototype HCV-1 core coding region (mutation of A342 → T and T343 → A) using primers 5′-CGTGCACCTAGAGCACGGATCCTAAACCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGGTTTAGGATCCGTGCTCTAGGTGCACG-3′ (antisense). This double substitution converts the start codon of the core coding region (ATG) into a stop codon (TAG). The primers also insert a BamHI enzyme site, mutating A351 → G, allowing us to check the mutation by digestion. Plasmid pHPI-775 is a product of site-directed mutagenesis at nt 357 of the prototype HCV-1 core coding region (mutation of A357→ T) using primers 5′-ATGAGCACGGATCCTTAACCTCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTGAGGTTAAGGATCCGTGCTCAT-3′ (antisense). This substitution converts Lys (AAA) into a stop codon (TAA). The primers also insert a BamHI enzyme site, mutating A351 → G, allowing us to check the mutation by digestion. Plasmid pHPI-777 is a product of site-directed mutagenesis at nt 453 of the prototype HCV-1 core coding region (mutation of C453 → A) using primers 5′-GTTTACTTGTTGACGCGCAGGGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCCTGCGCGTCAACAAGTAAAC-3′ (antisense). This substitution converts Cys (TGC) of the core+1 ORF into a stop codon (TGA). The primers also insert a Hin cII enzyme site, mutating C453 → A, allowing us to check the mutation by digestion. For bacterial expression of the recombinant core+1 fusion proteins, Escherichia coliXL1-Blue cells were transformed with plasmid pGEX-3X or pHPI-668 and grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.7 mm, and the bacterial cells were grown for an additional 3 h at 37 °C and then pelleted by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C. For the production of polyclonal antibodies against the core+1 ORF, peptide R1 (consisting of amino acid sequence CCRAGALDWVCARRERLPSGRNLEV) was chemically synthesized using the branched method, and peptide R2 (consisting of amino acid sequence AGGRDGSCLPVALGLA) was chemically synthesized and conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Both peptides were used to immunize rabbits. Specifically, 100 μg of each peptide were mixed separately with 750 μl of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) and injected into New Zealand White rabbits. The rabbits were boosted three times with the same antigens mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) at an interval of ∼2 weeks each. The antisera were collected 2 weeks after the last boost and used in Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The monoclonal antibody against the core protein was obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. and Biogenesis. Proteins from E. coli lysates transformed with pHPI-668 and the corresponding empty vector were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). The membrane was incubated with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C either with human sera diluted 1:100 or with anti-GST antiserum in 1% nonfat dry milk and Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, respectively, was used as the secondary antibody. Incubation with the secondary antibody was carried out at room temperature for 2 h. Recombinant proteins were detected using 4-chloro-1-naphthol solution as substrate. For all plasmids lacking an IRES, the TNT reticulocyte lysate coupled in vitro transcription/translation reaction kit (Promega) was used in a standard 50-μl reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol. For all the luciferase-expressing plasmids containing the HCV IRES element, Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) supplemented with KCl at 120 mm and Mg(OAc)2 at 0.5 mm were used. 1 μg of each DNA was linearized with SalI and transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.In vitro translation experiments were carried out on uncapped RNAs in a total volume of 25 μl using [35S]Met (Amersham Biosciences). 5 μl of the translation products were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by autoradiography. 5 μl of the same translation products were assayed for chemiluminescence using a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer and a Promega luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each in vitro transcription/translation reaction was performed in triplicate. 10 μg of plasmid pHPI-CS were linearized with BamHI and transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was dephosphorylated using shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the RNA was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas). After elution from a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the γ-labeled RNA was incubated with RNases A, T2, CL3, and T1 for 4 min at 37 °C in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 μg of tRNA and subsequently loaded onto a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. 20 μl of the translation products were mixed with 250 μl of triple detergent buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C either with 5 μl of monoclonal antibody or with 10 μl of polyclonal antibodies. 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) were added, and the reactions were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After microcentrifugation, the Sepharose beads were washed three times with buffer consisting of 50 mmTris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, and 0.02% sodium azide. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by autoradiography. As a first attempt to investigate the possibility of alternate translation within the HCV core coding region, the luciferase gene was fused with the first half of the core coding sequences (630 nt) in the 0, +1, and –1 frames relative to the AUG initiation codon of the polyprotein, and the expression of these constructs was analyzed in a cell-free system using rabbit reticulocyte lysates. To facilitate the construction of these plasmids, we designed three different sets of primers for PCR cloning of the HCV cDNA sequences into a luciferase gene-expressing vector (pGEM-luc). Each set of primers uses the same 5′-oligonucleotide, but different oligonucleotides complementary to the 3′-core coding sequences (Fig. 1A). Oligonucleotide A was designed to place the luciferase gene in the 0 frame relative to the AUG initiation codon. Oligonucleotide B contains a single nucleotide insertion mutation (T627) that places the luciferase gene in-frame with the overlapping ORF in the +1 frame relative to the core coding sequences (core+1 ORF). Oligonucleotide C contains a deletion of the adenine residue at nt 626, which places the luciferase gene in-frame with the –1 frame relative to the AUG initiation codon. Additionally, all three oligonucleotides contain a single base substitution at nt 630 (C to A) to create a BamHI cloning site. Three groups of plasmids were constructed using the above primers. The first group contains the core coding sequences from the prototype HCV-1 isolate, and it was designed to test for a possible expression of the core+1 ORF. Plasmid pHPI-766, constructed using oligonucleotide A, contains the luciferase gene fused in-frame with the preceding core coding sequences and served as a positive control. This plasmid was expected to produce a chimeric core-luciferase protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa, which is ∼10 kDa larger than the mass of the native luciferase protein. Plasmid pHPI-767, constructed using oligonucleotide B, contains the luciferase gene fused in-frame with the core+1 ORF. This plasmid was predicted to produce a chimeric luciferase protein only if the core +1 frame was expressed. The size of this putative protein would depend on the location of the translation initiation codon of the core+1 ORF. Finally, pHPI-768 plasmid, made using oligonucleotide C, carries the luciferase gene fused in-frame with the –1 frame relative to the core coding sequences and served as a negative control. Because the −1 frame contains multiple stop codons, no functional luciferase was predicted to be produced. As anticipated, in vitro translation of pHPI-766 resulted in the synthesis of a chimeric luciferase protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa. High enzymatic activity also indicated that this construct was capable of supporting the expression of an active chimeric core-luciferase protein (Fig. 1B, lane 4). As expected, only background levels of luciferase activity and no protein were detected from the expression of the pHPI-768 plasmid (Fig. 1B, lane 6). However, when pHPI-767 was used, a fusion protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa was again produced. This protein exhibited ∼54% luciferase activity relative to that from the pHPI-766 construct (Fig. 1B,lane 5). Notably, normal translation from the RNA of this plasmid led to a translation stop shortly after the luciferase gene region. As expected, the chimeric luciferase protein expressed from pHPI-767 reacted strongly with anti-core+1 antibodies (R1 and R2; see below), whereas no reaction was observed with the chimeric luciferase protein expressed from pHPI-768 (data not shown). Therefore, the results presented here provide the first direct evidence supporting the expression of the core+1 ORF from prototype HCV-1. We then sought to explore the possibility of a –1 ribosomal frameshift event within the core coding region of the same HCV isolate. Because the –1 frame of the core gene contains multiple stop codons, premature termination would prevent the detection of a potential –1 frameshift event. To overcome this limitation, we constructed a new series of plasmids that contained a single nucleotide deletion mutation within the core coding region (A364). This mutation introduced a change in the reading frame after the first 9 amino acids of the core ORF, thus placing the upstream AUG codon out-of-frame with respect to the core ORF and in-frame with the core+1 ORF. Consequently, plasmid pHPI-736, which was made with oligonucleotide A, placing the luciferase gene in-frame with the core ORF, now had the luciferase gene out-of-frame relative to the AUG initiation codon. This plasmid was therefore predicted to produce a functional luciferase protein only if a –1 frameshift event occurred. On the other hand, plasmid pHPI-725, which was made using oligonucleotide B, placing the luciferase gene in-frame with the core+1 ORF, now had the luciferase gene in-frame with the AUG initiation codon. This plasmid was expected to give rise to a hybrid luciferase protein containing the first 10 amino acids of the core protein followed by the 86 amino acids of the core+1 ORF in-frame with the luciferase gene. Finally, plasmid pHPI-737, which was made using oligonucleotide C, was our negative control plasmid because the luciferase gene was fused in the third frame containing the multiple stop codons. As shown in Fig. 1B (lane 1), when plasmid pHPI-725 was used to program in vitro translation, a fully active luciferase protein with an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa was produced. This construct reproducibly gave the highest levels of luciferase activity. Interestingly, plasmid pHPI-736 also produced an active luciferase protein with a similar size (72 kDa) and an enzymatic activity of ∼22% compared with our positive control construct (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 1, respectively). As predicted, anti-core+1 antibodies R1 and R2 reacted strongly with the chimeric luciferase protein from pHPI-725 and failed to react with the translation product from pHPI-736 (data not shown). No detectable signal was obtained from the translation products of our negative control construct plasmid pHPI-737 (Fig. 1B,lane 3). These data provide strong evidence for the presence of a –1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism within the core coding sequences and predict that the slippery site would be within the nucleotide sequences encoding the N terminus of the core protein. Finally, we sought to assess the expression of the core+1 ORF from another HCV isolate. Thus, a third set of plasmids containing the core codin"

One of the key events in many types of apoptosis is the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol, along with other proapoptotic factors like Smac/Diablo and AIF (1Adrain C. Martin S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 2Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c, in the presence of dATP/ATP, then triggers the formation of a complex containing procaspase-9 and APAF-1, which leads to activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 is an initiator caspase that processes effector procaspases, resulting in a cascade of proteolytic events and apoptotic death (3Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6273) Google Scholar). Diverse upstream death signals appear to be coupled to downstream transformations in mitochondria through the activation of members of a subgroup of the BCL-2 family of proteins, which contain only one of the four domains that define BCL-2 proteins, the BH-3 domain (4Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). One or more of these BH-3-only proteins, including BID, BAD, BIM, Bmf, and others (5Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 6Puthalakath H. Villunger A. O'Reilly L.A. Beaumont J.G. Coultas L. Cheney R.E. Huang D.C. Strasser A. Science. 2001; 293: 1829-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), become activated in response to a death signal, which typically causes their translocation to mitochondria. The resulting organelle dysfunction and cytochrome c egress depend on a second proapoptotic subgroup of the BCL-2 family located in the mitochondrial outer membrane, the effector molecules BAX and BAK (7Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar,8Zong W.X.

The third subgroup of the BCL-2 family is antiapoptotic and, in addition to the BH-1, -2, and -3 domains found in the proapoptotic effectors BAX and BAK, contains a BH-4 domain. When present in the mitochondrial outer membrane in excess, antiapoptotic BCL-2 members, such as BCL-2 and BCL-XL, maintain organelle integrity even in the face of sustained death signaling (5Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 9Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). Of note, however, these antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins are also found in association with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumAdadenoviral vectorBKAbongkrekic acidHAhemagglutininHMheavy membraneLMlight membranePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerasePTPpermeability transition porezVAD-fmkbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone and nuclear envelope (10Akao Y.

Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Whereas its cell cycle arrest function is well defined, the molecular basis for proapoptotic signaling by p53 is only now emerging. It appears to operate by inducing the production of a number of constitutively active proapoptotic proteins, each of which is able to independently trigger apoptosis (12Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T.

Moreover, the APAF-1-caspase-9 complex has been shown to be necessary for p53 to induce apoptosis, thus implicating cytochrome c release as an important step in the p53 apoptotic pathway (17Soengas M.S.

Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 19Han J. Sabbatini P. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) is up-regulated in p53-null H1299 cells infected with an adenovirus vector coding for wild-type p53. A significant fraction of cellular BIK localizes to ER membranes, where it can induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Both in vitro reconstitution experiments and engineered targeting of BIK to ER in vivo, using the heterologous cytochrome b5 transmembrane domain, revealed that this process is independent of a direct interaction between BIK protein and mitochondria and does not depend on BAX translocation/insertion in mitochondria. Collectively, our results suggest that BH3-only BIK is capable of initiating cytochrome c release from mitochondria and apoptosis from a location at the ER. H1299 lung carcinoma cells and KB epithelial cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and penicillin. Cells were infected at 100 plaque-forming units/cell with adenovirus vectors expressing either wild-type p53, wild-type BIK tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the N terminus, or a BH3 HA-BIK mutant in which leucine at position 61 was converted to glycine (L61G), as described (20Nguyen M.

Virol. 1997; 71: 3526-3533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were collected in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.3 mm sodium citrate and 0.6 mmEDTA, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell viability was assessed by the ability to exclude trypan blue. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-p53 and anti-cytochrome c (PharMingen), anti-PARP (C-II-10) (Biomol), and anti-HA (Babco); rabbit anti-BAX, rabbit anti-cytochrome c, and goat anti-BIK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-calnexin and rabbit anti-BiP (gift from J. Bergeron); mouse anti-actin (gift from P. Braun); and chicken antibodies against TOM20 (22Goping I.S. Millar D.G. Shore G.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and BAP31 (23Ng F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with specific antibodies. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Human KB epithelial cells (80–90% confluent) were transfected with pcDNA3 vector encoding FLAG-BIK or a BIK mutant in which the transmembrane domain (amino acids 135–160) has been replaced by the transmembrane domain of rabbit cytochrome b5 (amino acids 107–134) (FLAG-BIKb5TM). After 24 h, 1 × 104 cells were centrifuged onto coverslips for 1 min at 2000 × g in a Cyto-Tek centrifuge (Sakura). The recovered cells were then fixed and analyzed by double label immunofluorescence. Cells were visualized with a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope, and images were captured and overlaid with the accompanying software. H1299 cells (50% confluence) were either mock-infected or infected with Ad vector for the indicated times, harvested, and suspended in HIM buffer (200 mmmannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA) (approximately 108 cells/ml). Cells were broken with 25 strokes in a motorized Teflon-glass homogenizer operating at 2000 rpm, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris (all subsequent steps were for 10 min). The supernatant was centrifuged at 9000 × g, the resulting pellet resuspended in 100 μl of HIM and recentrifuged at 9000 × g to give the heavy membrane (HM) fraction enriched in mitochondria. The supernatant from the first 9000 × g centrifugation, designated S9, was centrifuged at 170,000 × g to give the cytosolic supernatant (S100) and light membrane (LM) fractions. In certain instances, the HM and LM fractions were further processed by uniformly resuspending 10 μg of the membrane protein in 150 μl of 0.1m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and incubating on ice for 30 min. Alkaline-insoluble membrane protein was then recovered by centrifugation for 10 min at 170,000 × g. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. S9 or S100 fractions (described above) were prepared from H1299 cells that were either mock-infected (control) or infected with Ad HA-BIK for 14 h in the presence of 50 μm zVAD-fmk and designated the “donor fractions.” HM, on the other hand, was prepared only from control H1299 cells (i.e. lacking BIK expression), resuspended at a concentration of 1 μg of protein/μl in cMRM (250 mmsucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm sodium succinate, 0.08 mm ADP, 2 mm K2HPO4), and designated the “acceptor fraction.” Alternatively, S100 and HM from mouse liver mitochondria were prepared as described (24Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure cytochrome c release from mitochondria, S9 fractions containing 35 μg of protein in 12.5 μl of HIM or its S100 and LM derivatives were mixed with 12.5 μl of cMRM containing HM (12.5 μg of protein) and 50 μm zVAD-fmk and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and an aliquot of the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody against cytochrome c. For the assays using mouse liver mitochondria and suboptimal amounts of S9, 15 μg of S9 and 30 μg of mouse S100 were used. Input of mitochondria and recovery of the organelle in the pellet were typically monitored by blotting with antibody against the human mitochondrial protein import receptor located in the outer membrane, TOM20. Delivery of an adenoviral vector expressing the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor protein (Ad p53) to the p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cell line resulted in induction of p53 protein within 12 h, followed by cell death that was partially inhibited by the general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig. 1A). Cytochrome c was released from mitochondria, and caspases were activated, as reflected by the cleavage of PARP (Fig. 1B). Although zVAD-fmk was able to completely block PARP cleavage, it did not have any effect on the release of cytochrome c, suggesting that the molecular events leading from p53 activation to cytochrome c release are not strongly dependent on zVAD-fmk-sensitive caspases. On the other hand, BCL-2 inhibited both cytochrome c release from mitochondria and PARP cleavage (Fig. 1B). The proapoptotic BCL-2 homologue BAX is typically found loosely associated with HM enriched in mitochondria, in addition to its cytosolic localization in untreated cells. Upon apoptotic stimulus, however, it becomes integrated into the outer mitochondrial membrane and resistant to alkali extraction (25Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). As was seen for cytochrome c release, acquisition of alkaline resistance of BAX in response to Ad p53 was insensitive to zVAD-fmk but was inhibited by BCL-2 (Fig. 1C). In addition to the activation of BAX, p53 is believed to induce apoptosis by up-regulating multiple proapoptotic proteins, including members of the BH3-only class of the BCL-2 family, such as Noxa (14Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar) and Puma (15Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 16Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). The BH-3-only protein BIK (18Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 19Han J. Sabbatini P. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) is another potential p53 target, since it was induced by the ectopic expression of p53 in H1299 cells, while being undetectable in control cells (Fig. 1D). Induction of BIK by Ad p53 occurred before the cells showed overt signs of loss of viability (starting at 24 h), as assessed by the exclusion of trypan blue (Fig. 1, A and D), with the kinetics of BIK induction paralleling that of cytochrome c release and the acquisition of BAX alkaline resistance (Fig. 1, B and C, and data not shown). To study directly BIK-induced apoptosis, an adenovirus expressing wild-type HA-tagged BIK was employed. Induction of BIK in p53-null H1299 cells using this system resulted in cell killing that was inhibited by zVAD-fmk (Fig. 2A), indicating the requirement for caspases. BIK also triggered the insertion of BAX into mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 2B). This was accompanied by loss of cytochrome c from mitochondria within 14 h of treatment and activation of caspases as judged by the cleavage of the caspase target BAP31 (23Ng F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). While zVAD-fmk prevented cell death (Fig. 2A) and caspase cleavage of BAP31 (Fig. 2C), it had little effect on membrane insertion of BAX and cytochrome c release from mitochondria, suggesting that, like p53, BIK-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is likely to be independent of zVAD-fmk-sensitive caspases. In addition, BIK activity required a functional BH3 domain, since a BIK mutant in which the conserved leucine 61 in the BH3 domain was mutated to a glycine (BIK(L61G)) did not cause cell death (not shown), cytochrome c release, or caspase cleavage of BAP31 (Fig. 2C). Mutant BIK expression was higher than that of wild-type BIK (not shown). In order to study the cellular localization of BIK, KB epithelial cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type BIK and examined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. FLAG-BIK showed extensive co-localization with the ER marker calnexin, and this reticular network mostly comprised regions within the cell that did not include the mitochondrial outer membrane marker TOM20 (representative images are shown in Fig. 3A). Similarly, fractionation of H1299 cells infected with Ad HA-BIK revealed a co-distribution of HA-BIK and calnexin in the LM fraction. HA-BIK was also recovered in the HM fraction containing mitochondria, as judged by the presence of TOM20, but this fraction also contained the ER protein calnexin (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with endogenous BIK following infection of H1299 cells with Ad p53 (data not shown). LM-associated BIK was resistant to alkali extraction but sensitive to proteinase K digestion (Fig. 3C), suggesting that BIK is integrated in the ER membrane and facing the cytosolic side. As controls, transmembrane calnexin was sensitive to proteinase K (employing an antibody raised against its cytosolic tail), whereas the luminal chaperone BiP was resistant, and only BiP was extracted by alkali (Fig. 3C). These experiments suggested that BIK might induce cytochrome c release and cell death from an ER location, although partial association of BIK with the mitochondria cannot be ruled out. Thus, to address the contribution of ER-localized BIK to cytochrome c release and cell death more fully, we generated a mutant BIK in which its C-terminal transmembrane domain was replaced by the C-terminal transmembrane segment of cytochrome b5 (FLAG-BIK-b5TM), a sequence previously shown to selectively target fusion proteins to the ER (26Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Longhi R. Bulbarelli A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 899-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Rudner J. Lepple-Wienhues A. Budach W. Berschauer J. Friedrich B. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. Belka C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4161-4172PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular localization of this mutant was first studied by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy following transient transfection into KB cells. As shown in the representative images in Fig. 4A, FLAG-BIK-b5TM strongly co-localized with ER calnexin. Like FLAG-BIK, FLAG-BIK-b5TM was able to cause cytochrome c release from mitochondria in the presence of zVAD-fmk (Fig. 4B). Both proteins also induced cell death, as measured by a luciferase reporter essay (Fig. 4C) or by visual examination of cells co-transfected with vector expressing green fluorescent protein (not shown). That FLAG-BIK-b5TM triggered cytochrome c release from mitochondria and cell death argues that BIK can function through its location in the ER. To establish that BIK present in the ER can indeed stimulate cytochrome c release from mitochondria, the system was reconstituted in vitro (Fig. 5A). The assay comprised a donor and an acceptor fraction. The donor is an S9 extract from Ad HA-BIK-infected H1299 cells that contains LM and HA-BIK but that is free of mitochondria (as judged by the absence of TOM20) (Fig. 5B). The acceptor fraction is an HM fraction from uninfected cells that is enriched in mitochondria but contains no HA-BIK (Fig. 5B) or endogenous BIK (Fig. 1D). To minimize the influence of caspases, zVAD-fmk was both provided to the cells during Ad HA-BIK infection and included in the in vitro assays. The influence of the S9 or its derived S100 and LM components on recipient HM was determined by incubating donor fractions with acceptor HM in vitro for 30 min at 37 °C, recovering the HM by centrifugation at 13,000 × g, and measuring release of cytochrome c into the supernatant by immunoblotting. In all cases, equivalent amounts of S9 protein (35 μg) were added to the reactions. As shown in Fig. 5C, donor S9 from Ad HA-BIK-infected cells, but not from control cells, induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. This effect was dependent on the presence of the LM, since their removal prevented cytochrome c release (Fig. 5C; compare S100 and S9). Cytochrome c release that was induced by LM-associated HA-BIK was also dependent on a functional BH3, since the L61G mutant was inactive (Fig. 5D). Of note, there was no detectable presence of HA-BIK recovered with the HM after incubation with donor HA-BIK S9 (Fig. 5E), whereas most of the TOM20 was recovered in this fraction. This indicates that stimulation of cytochrome c release from mitochondria by S9 HA-BIK did not occur because HA-BIK translocated from ER to mitochondria. Although BIK can interact with antiapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family (18Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 19Han J. Sabbatini P. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the in vitro reconstitution system afforded the opportunity to investigate the influence of BCL-2 operating downstream of BIK. This was addressed in the in vitro system by using HM from cells that overexpress BCL-2 (20Nguyen M. Branton P.E. Walton P.A. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16521-16524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, mitochondrial BCL-2 efficiently prevented cytochrome c release by HA-BIK S9. The influence of BCL-2 on the integrity of mitochondrial outer membrane and cytochrome c release has been suggested to be related to its effects on mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) (28Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Beutner G. Brdiczka D. Remy R. Xie Z.H. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 29Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). The involvement of PTP in the in vitro BIK-induced cytochrome c release was thus tested using the PTP inhibitor bongkrekic acid (BKA). As shown in Fig. 6B, 100 μm BKA did not block BIK-induced cytochrome c release, but it inhibited cytochrome c release by a known PTP activator, Ca2+, indicating that the PTP does not play a major role in LM BIK-induced cytochrome c release. ER membranes have been shown to influence mitochondria by controlling the intracellular stores of divalent cations, mainly Ca2+(30Pinton P. Ferrari D. Rapizzi E., Di Virgilio F.D. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2690-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Whereas a role of Ca2+ is unlikely in our in vitro system, since 1 mm EGTA was present in the incubation buffer and Ca2+-sensitive PTP does not appear to contribute to cytochrome c release (Fig. 6B), other cations such as Mg2+ could be important (31Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). However, 5 mm EDTA did not modulate the cytochrome c release activity of the HA-BIK S9 donor fraction (Fig. 6A). Thus, the BIK-induced cytochrome c release pathway observed here is unlikely to be mediated by an effect on the levels of free Ca2+ or Mg2+. Since infection of H1299 cells with Ad HA-BIK promotes BAX insertion into mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 2B) and since regulated BAX insertion into mitochondrial membrane is a potential effector of BIK-induced cytochrome c release (7Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar, 8Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), its role in the in vitro system was investigated. As shown in Fig. 7A, S9 extract from Ad-HA-BIK-infected cells but not from control cells caused BAX to become alkali-resistant. Since S9 Ad BIK contains very little BAX (Fig. 7B, Input H1299 S9 Ad BIK), the origin of alkali-resistant BAX is presumably that which is associated with the acceptor HM (see Fig. 2B, lane 2). To better assess the contribution of BAX, therefore, we prepared HM from BAX-null liver. Both BAX−/− and BAX+/−acceptor HM could support cytochrome c release by H1299 S9 Ad BIK (data not shown). In addition, when using limiting concentration of the donor S9 that marginally cause cytochrome c release by itself, cytochrome c release was achieved by adding S100 from either BAX+/− or BAX−/− mouse liver (Fig. 7B), whereas the S100 on their own failed to induce cytochrome c release (data not shown). Under all conditions tested, there was no translocation of BAX to mitochondria (Fig. 7B). Altogether, these results indicate that BIK requires the presence of a constitutive cytosolic component to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria, which is not BAX. Since the depletion of LM from H1299 S9 Ad BIK abrogated its capacity to induce cytochrome c release (Fig. 5C), LM is also a required constituent. In contrast, LM on its own failed to induce cytochrome c release (Fig. 7C). In addition, no cytochrome c release was observed when the donor S9 fraction was preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C, after which the LM were spun down and the resulting supernatant was used as the donor in the cytochrome c release assay (Fig. 7C), indicating that a sustained presence of the LM is required. Thus, a complex signaling pathway is initiated by BIK, requiring both LM and cytosolic constituents. Recent evidence suggests that BH-3-only BCL-2 homologues induce apoptosis by binding to mitochondria and causing cytochrome c release, dependent on the effector proteins BAX and BAK (7Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). A number of these BH-3-only members, like BID and BAD, become activated in response to death signals through structural changes to preexisting inactive conformers (9Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). In contrast, p53 stimulates the production of several constitutively active BH-3-only proteins, including BIK, Puma, and Noxa, each of which can autonomously induce mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. While Noxa and Puma have been reported to influence mitochondrial integrity directly (14Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N.

Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), we show here that BIK can stimulate mitochondrial release of cytochrome c from a location at the ER. This is the first demonstration of a canonical BH-3-only member of the BCL-2 family initiating an apoptotic signaling pathway from this organelle. A significant proportion of both overexpressed and endogenous BIK was found to co-localize with the ER marker calnexin, both by immunofluorescence in KB epithelial cells and by biochemical fractionation in H1299 cells. Although a second pathway involving mitochondrial BIK cannot be excluded, results from both in vitro reconstitution and the demonstration that FLAG-BIK-b5TM can induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria in vivo during cell death argue that ER-localized BIK is functional. Of note, however, we have found that APAF-1−/− cells are resistant to BIK-induced caspase activation and cell death but that BIK still induces cytochrome c release from their mitochondria (not shown). This result confirms that BIK operates upstream of cytochrome c release in an obligate APAF-1-mediated death pathway, as previously suggested by the use of a caspase-9 dominant negative (32Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7783-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The relationship between induction of ER (LM)-localized BIK and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was studied in an in vitro system in which an S9 fraction from Ad HA-BIK H1299 cells was incubated with an HM fraction from control cells lacking BIK. It can be concluded from these experiments that ER-localized BIK triggers a cytochrome c-releasing activity that is dependent on the BIK BH3 domain as well as on the presence of both LM and cytosol. In this in vitro system, ER BIK did not dissociate from the LM to impose its activity by direct binding to mitochondria. In addition, cytochrome c release was not influenced by the PTP inhibitor BKA and was independent of BAX translocation/insertion into mitochondrial membrane. Although regulated targeting of BAX is one way in which mitochondrial dysfunction can be coupled to an upstream death signal, the lack of dependence may reflect the redundancy provided by the BAX homologue BAK, which is constitutively present in the mitochondrial outer membrane (8Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 24Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, however, our results suggest a complex pathway initiated by BIK, in which BIK regulates mitochondrial dysfunction through both ER and cytosolic factors independent of cytosolic BAX. BIK was discovered through a search for proteins that interact with antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins and was subsequently shown to readily co-immunoprecipitate with BCL-2 and BCL-XL (18Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 19Han J. Sabbatini P.

These antiapoptotic BCL-2 homologues have been shown to be associated with ER and nuclear membranes in addition to their mitochondrial location (10Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of proapoptotic BIK and antiapoptotic BCL-2 homologues in the ER, therefore, may influence the ER pathway that regulates mitochondrial integrity. Although a pathway involving Ca2+ is an obvious candidate, neither this cation nor Mg2+ appears to be involved in the pathway described here. Of particular note, however, we also found that excess BCL-2 in the acceptor HM blocked cytochrome c release after stimulation with S9 Ad BIK, indicating that BCL-2 can also function downstream on the BIK pathway. In conclusion, our data identify BIK as initiating a pathway from its location in the ER that stimulates cytochrome c release from mitochondria and that would be activated upon the induction of BIK protein by p53. This p53 pathway is distinct from other p53-induced targets such as the mitochondrial BH3-only proteins Noxa and Puma, suggesting yet another level at which p53-dependent apoptosis is controlled. We are thankful to Richard Marcellus for the Ad HA-BIK vector constructs, to Ruth Slack for the BAX knockout animals, and to John Bergeron and Peter Braun for antibodies."

It has been reported that both CBP and p300 are significant for the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), which is a crucial nuclear receptor in adipogenesis. However, it remains unclear whether CBP and/or p300 is physiologically essential to the activation of PPARγ in adipocytes and adipocyte differentiation. In this study, we investigated the physiological significance of CBP/p300 in NIH3T3 cells transiently expressing PPARγ and CBP and in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing CBP- or p300-specific ribozymes. In PPARγ-transfected NIH3T3 cells, induction of expression of PPARγ target genes such as adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) by adding thiazolidinedione was enhanced, depending on the amount of a CBP expression plasmid transfected. Expression of aP2 and LPL genes, as well as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and triacylglyceride accumulation after adipogenic induction, was largely suppressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing either the CBP- or p300-specific active ribozyme, but not in inactive ribozyme-expressing cells. These data suggest that both CBP and p300 are indispensable for the full activation of PPARγ and adipocyte differentiation and that CBP and p300 do not mutually complement in the process.

Adipose tissues are significant in regulation of common diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension (1.Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). This is because, during their differentiation and maturation, adipocytes release many bioactive molecules (called “adipocytokines”), including adipsin, angiotensinogen, leptin, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-αtumor necrosis factor αPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorPPREPPAR response elementTZDthiazolidinedioneDMdifferentiation mediumCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinRXRretinoid-X receptorC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinLPLlipoprotein lipaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase1The abbreviations used are: TNF-αtumor necrosis factor αPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorPPREPPAR response elementTZDthiazolidinedioneDMdifferentiation mediumCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinRXRretinoid-X receptorC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinLPLlipoprotein lipaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and adiponectin (2.Trayhurn P.

TNF-α is a negative factor released from mature adipocytes, that is, it suppresses glucose uptake into adipose tissues or skeletal muscles (3.Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). On the other hand, adiponectin is a positive factor released from nonmature adipocytes, that is, it enhances insulin sensitivity (4.Hotta K. Funahashi T. Bodkin N.L. Ortmeyer H.K. Arita Y.

Upon induction of differentiation, a cascade of gene transcription events occurs, leading to the expression of adipocyte-specific genes (6.Bradley R.L. Cleveland K.A. Cheatham B. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 329-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One of the essential genes involved in the cascade encodes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the ligand-activated nuclear receptor superfamily (7.Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17Google Scholar). PPARγ binds to the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (8.Tontonoz P. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Hu E. Tempst P. Spiegelman B.M.

Exogenous expression of PPARγ transforms NIH3T3 fibroblasts and G8 myoblasts into adipocyte-like cells (10.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar, 11.Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Moreover, PPARγ is activated by anti-diabetes drugs, such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) (12.Reginato M.J. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Minami C. Ishii S. Tanaka H. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32679-32684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). TZDs stimulate differentiation of preadipocytes and up-regulate glucose uptake into the adipose tissue by activating PPARγ. TZDs also suppress the expression of TNF-α and enhance that of adiponectin in differentiated adipocytes (13.Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 14.Maeda N. Takahashi M. Funahashi T. Kihara S. Nishizawa H. Kishida K. Nagaretani H. Matsuda M. Komuro R. Ouchi N. Kuriyama H. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2094-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of PPARγ is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation as well as insulin activity in adipose tissues. It has recently been reported that coactivators are necessary for the activation of nuclear receptors, including PPARγ (15.Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar, 16.Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Coactivators interact with nuclear receptors in a ligand-dependent manner and recruit basal transcriptional factors such as RNA polymerases proximal to a nuclear receptor complex in a gene promoter region. Among the coactivators, the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and its highly related p300 protein have been rather well characterized to date. These coactivators are expressed ubiquitously, and they participate in many basic cellular events (17.Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). PPARγ interacts with CBP and p300 in a ligand-dependent manner, and p300, in turn, enhances the activity of PPARγ (18.Mizukami J. Taniguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19.Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, it has not yet been clarified whether CBP and/or p300 can actually affect the expression of PPARγ target genes in adipocytes or whether expression of endogenous CBP and/or p300 is indispensable for adipocyte differentiation. The aim of this study was to elucidate the physiological role of CBP and p300 in PPARγ-mediated gene expression in preadipocytes and adipocytes. Detailed analyses revealed that overexpression of CBP or p300 with PPARγ enhanced the expression of PPARγ target genes in NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, either CBP- or p300-specific ribozyme-mediated targeting resulted in suppressed gene expression of adipogenic markers such as adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), as well as reduction in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells upon induction of adipocyte differentiation. This suggests that both CBP and p300 are indispensable for adipocyte differentiation and that CBP and p300 do not mutually complement in the process. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the physiological relevance of CBP and p300 in adipocytes. T174 TZD, a specific ligand for PPARγ (18.Mizukami J. Taniguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). All other chemicals were from Sigma or Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) and were of guaranteed reagent grade or tissue culture grade. Expression plasmids for coactivators, pCMX-CBP and pCMX-p300, were kind gifts from Dr. R. H. Goodman (Oregon Health Sciences University) and Dr. D. M. Livingston (Harvard Medical School), respectively. pSK-CBP, which included CBP cDNA in pBlueScript-SK(+) (Stratagene), was used as a control plasmid to make the amounts of DNA transfected constant in transient expression assays. pSG5mPPARγ for mouse PPARγ and pE1A for adenoviral oncoprotein E1A were supplied by Dr. P. A. Grimaldi (INSERM U470) and Dr. T. Kouzarides (Wellcome/Cancer Research Campaign (CRC) Institute), respectively. A luciferase reporter plasmid containing four tandem repeats of the PPAR response element (PPRE) followed by a thymidine kinase promoter, p4xPPRE-tk-luc, was from Dr. K. Umesono (Kyoto University). pRL-CMV (Promega) was used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiencies in luciferase assays. CBP- and p300-specific active ribozymes (RzCBP-wt and Rzp300-wt, respectively) have target sequences against nucleic acid sequences 484–502 in CBP cDNA and 364–382 in p300 cDNA, respectively (20.Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Inactive mutants of the CBP- and p300-specific ribozymes (RzCBP-mut and Rzp300-mut, respectively) have point mutations on each ribozyme active site, which cannot cleave target mRNAs (20.Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Fragments of RzCBP and Rzp300 with EcoRI and SalI ends were inserted into a retrovirus expression vector, pMX-puro (a gift from Dr. T. Kitamura, University of Tokyo) (21.Misawa K. Nosaka T. Morita S. Kaneko A. Nakahata T. Asano S. Kitamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3062-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) via the same sites, generating pMX-RzCBP and pMX-Rzp300, respectively. For the preparation of recombinant retroviruses, expression constructs were transiently transfected into Phoenix ecotroping packaging cells (a kind gift from Dr. G. Nolan, Stanford University) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and then the conditioned medium was recovered for subsequent infection. Murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts and murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. All cell lines were maintained in a maintenance medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μm ascorbic acid, and 10 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% air under a humidified condition. For luciferase assays using NIH3T3 cells cultured on 24-well tissue culture plates, pSG5-mPPARγ (0.4 μg/well), pCMX-CBP and/or pSK-CBP (0.4 μg/well), p4xPPRE-tk-luc (0.4 μg/well), and pRL-CMV (0.4 ng/well) were transfected into NIH3T3 cells. For quantification of PPARγ target transcripts, pSG5-mPPARγ (0.5 μg/well) and pCMX-CBP and/or pSK-CBP (0.5 μg/well) were transfected into NIH3T3 cells cultured on 6-well tissue culture plates. An expression vector for E1A, pE1A (0.5 μg/well), was included as indicated in Fig. 1 Bto inhibit CBP/p300 activity. The transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were supplemented with 10 μm TZD, cultured for another 24 h, and then lysed in the recommended lysis buffer for estimation of luciferase activity or harvested for mRNA preparation. Luciferase assays were performed using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). 3T3-L1 cells expressing RzCBP-wt/-mut or Rzp300-wt/-mut were selected in a cell culture medium containing 2.0 μg/ml puromycin after infection with the corresponding retrovirus. To exclude the clonal variation in adipocyte differentiation, polyclonal cells were used directly for subsequent assays. The cells expressing ribozymes were cultured on 6-well tissue culture plates for immunoblotting and differentiation assays as described previously (22.Kawada T. Kamei Y. Sugimoto E. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1996; 20: S52-S57PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after 4 days, when confluence was reached, cells were incubated in a differentiation medium (DM), which is the maintenance medium supplemented with 0.25 μm dexamethazone, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After 40 h, the cell culture medium was changed to post-DM, which is DM supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, and then the medium was replaced with fresh medium every 2 days. Eight days after differentiation induction, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was prepared using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples for biochemical assays were prepared using cells cultured on 6-well tissue culture plates. The measurement of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was performed as described previously (22.Kawada T. Kamei Y. Sugimoto E. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1996; 20: S52-S57PubMed Google Scholar). The content of cellular triacylglycerol was measured using a TG Test WAKO kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industry Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Protein concentrations of samples for immunoblotting were determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (22.Kawada T. Kamei Y. Sugimoto E. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1996; 20: S52-S57PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-mouse PPARγ antibody was obtained from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., and antibodies against RXRα, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, CBP, and p300 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-β-actin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs were purchased from Chemicon International Inc. and DAKO A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark), respectively. Oil-Red O staining was performed as follows: cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then stained with 60% filtered Oil-Red O stock solution (0.15 g of Oil-Red O in 50 ml of isopropanol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with 60% isopropanol and then washed briefly with water and examined under a microscope. Aliquots of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a thermal cycler (Takara PCR Thermal Cycler SP; Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacturers' instructions. To quantify mRNA expression, PCR was performed using a fluorescence temperature cycler (LightCycler System; Roche Diagnostics). The oligonucleotide primer sets of mouse PPAR target genes were designed using a PCR primer selection program at the web site of the Virtual Genomic Center from the GenBank™data base as follows: (a) mouse LPL(GenBank™ accession number J03302), forward primer 5′-ATCCATGGATGGACGGTAACG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTGGATCCCAATACTTCGACCA-3′; (b) aP2(GenBank™ accession number K02109), forward primer 5′-AAGACAGCTCCTCCTCGAAGGTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGACCAAATCCCCATTTACGC-3′); and (c) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; GenBank™ accession number M32599), forward primer 5′-GAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAAGACACCAGTAGACTCCACGACATA-3′). Amplification was performed according to a published protocol (23.Rasmussen R. Meuer S. Wittwer C. Nakagawara K. Quantification on the LightCycler. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York2001: 21-34Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction solution (10 μl, final volume) contained 3 μm MgCl2, 2.0 μl of LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I dye, and 5 μm of each primer. The standard amplification program included 30 cycles of three steps each, which involved heating the product to 95 °C at 20 °C/s with a 30-s hold, annealing to 55 °C at 20 °C/s with a 5-s hold, and extension to 72 °C at 20 °C/s with a 10-s hold. The fluorescence at 530 nm was recorded on-line at the end of the extension phase. The amplified products were subcloned into the T-easy vector (Promega), sequenced, and used as PCR standards. The copy number of each standard plasmid was calculated from the absorbance at 260 nm and the molecular mass of each plasmid. The copy numbers of standards and samples were amplified simultaneously in the LightCycler. The first cycle number indicated specific fluorescence against noise, and the logarithm of the concentration of the PCR product standard, the external standard curve, was calculated using LightCycler software. To confirm the amplification of specific transcripts, melting curve profiles were generated at the end of each run. To compare the mRNA expression level among samples, the copy number of each transcript was divided by that of GAPDH, which showed a constant mRNA expression level. All data indicating the mRNA expression level were presented as a ratio with respect to that of the control in each experiment. The data are presented as means ± S.E. and were analyzed statistically using the unpaired ttest or the Welch t test when variances were heterogeneous. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. It has been reported in detail that CBP and p300 interact with PPARγ in a ligand-dependent manner, and increasing the amount of p300 enhanced PPARγ activity (18.Mizukami J. Taniguchi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19.Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, it remained unknown whether an increase in the CBP protein expression level could promote PPARγ transactivation in intact cells. To elucidate this, we performed luciferase assays by transfecting a reporter plasmid with the PPRE into PPARγ-transfected NIH3T3 fibroblasts, which differentiate into adipocyte-like cells in a PPARγ ligand-dependent manner (10.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Increasing the amount of an expression plasmid for CBP enhanced luciferase activity in the presence of 10 μm TZD (Fig. 1 A). Cotransfection of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 μg/well pCMX-CBP (a CBP expression vector) induced luciferase activities that were 1.2-, 1.9-, and 2.8-fold higher, respectively, than those of mock transfectants in the presence of TZD. These results suggest that the expression of CBP could enhance PPARγ activity against ligand as much as expression of p300. It was also investigated whether coexpression of CBP/p300 could regulate the gene promoter activity of endogenous promoters of PPARγ target genes in cells. We used the PPARγ-transfected NIH3T3 cells for luciferase assays. As shown in Fig. 1 B, cotransfection of PPARγ and CBP expression plasmids up-regulated the expression of endogenous aP2 (left panel) and LPL(right panel) by the addition of 10 μm TZD. PPARγ regulates the expression of aP2 and LPL, which is parallel to adipocyte differentiation (24.Hunt C.R. Ro J.H. Dobson D.E. Min H.Y. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1998; 244: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore,aP2 and LPL have been used as well-characterized PPARγ target genes and typical adipocyte differentiation markers. The expression of these endogenous genes depended on the amount of CBP plasmids transfected; cotransfection of 0.5 and 1.0 μg/well pCMX-CBP resulted in 2.3- and 4.1-fold increases in the up-regulation ofaP2, respectively, compared with mock transfectants in the presence of 10 μm TZD (Fig. 1 B, left panel). In a similar manner, cotransfection of 0.5 and 1.0 μg/well pCMX-CBP increased the expression level of LPL by 1.5- and 2.0-fold, respectively, compared with mock transfectants (Fig. 1 B, right panel). Nearly the same results were obtained for p300 coexpression (data not shown). Moreover, the enhancement by CBP coexpression was significantly suppressed by coexpression of adenoviral oncoprotein E1A, which is known as a viral regulatory protein that specifically suppresses CBP/p300 activity in virus-infected cells (26.Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, this result indicates that the increase in the CBP expression level was involved in the up-regulation of PPARγ target genes in cells. These results strongly suggest that CBP and p300 proteins were involved in the up-regulation of PPARγ target genes in intact cells. Next, to further deepen the understanding of the physiological relevance of CBP and p300, we established 3T3-L1 preadipocytes expressing a CBP- or p300-specific active ribozyme (RzCBP-wt or Rzp300-wt, respectively). RzCBP-wt and Rzp300-wt, which specifically cleave target mRNAs, can down-regulate the expression of CBP and p300 protein, respectively, in cells expressing the ribozyme (20.Kawasaki H. Eckner R. Yao T.P. Taira K. Chiu R. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 cells expressing a mutant of RzCBP-wt or Rzp300-wt (RzCBP-mut or Rzp300-mut, respectively), which is inactive on mRNA cleavage, were also established as controls. After puromycin selection, polyclonal cells for each ribozyme were used directly for subsequent analyses. Cells were lysed, and expression levels of CBP were determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2, left panels). The expression of CBP was suppressed in 3T3-L1 cells expressing RzCBP-wt (3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt) to ∼20% as compared with that in RzCBP-mut-expressing cells (3T3-L1-RzCBP-mut). However, there was no difference in the expression levels of p300 between 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt and 3T3-L1-RzCBP-mut (Fig. 2). Conversely, the p300 expression level in 3T3-L1-Rzp300-wt decreased ∼30% as compared with that in 3T3-L1-Rzp300-mut (Fig. 2, right panels). Steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), another coactivator for PPARγ (27.Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar), and β-actin were expressed at nearly the same levels in any cells used. These results indicate that ribozymes specifically decreased the CBP or p300 mRNA expression level, resulting in a decreased expression level of each protein in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. We next examined the expression levels of transcription factors involved in PPARγ activation in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt/-mut. Confluent cells were lysed and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the expression level of PPARγ2 in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt was comparable to that in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-mut (Fig. 3 A). Although PPARγ1, another isoform of PPARγ in preadipocytes, was not detected, the total expression levels of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 were shown to be comparable in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt and 3T3-L1-RzCBP-mut by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses (data not shown). RXRs are heterodimer partners of PPARγ and are essential to various functions of PPARγ (28.Lala D.S. Mukherjee R. Schulman I.G. Koch S.S. Dardashti L.J. Nadzan A.M. Croston G.E. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 cells, RXRα is a functional subtype, and RXRβ is expressed as well (8.Tontonoz P. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Hu E. Tempst P. Spiegelman B.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5628-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 30.Kamei Y. Kawada T. Kazuki R. Sugimoto E. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The expression levels of RXRα also did not differ in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt and 3T3-L1-RzCBP-mut (Fig. 3 A). The absence of difference in the PPARγ and RXRα expression levels in undifferentiated cells suggests that a decreased expression level of CBP does not affect the basal expression levels of PPARγ and RXRα in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt and 3T3-L1-RzCBP-mut were then stimulated with TZD, and the expression of PPARγ target genes aP2 andLPL was investigated. The addition of 10 μmTZD resulted in a 53- and 5.4-fold increase in the expression level ofaP2 and LPL mRNA, respectively, in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-mut, whereas only a 20- and 1.4-fold increase inaP2 and LPL mRNA, respectively, was observed in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt (Fig. 3 B). Experiments using 3T3-L1-Rzp300-wt/-mut showed results similar to those using 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt/-mut (data not shown). These data suggest that the decrease in expression levels of CBP/p300 resulted in the suppression of PPARγ target gene expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and that endogenous expression of CBP/p300 was essential to the induction of PPARγ target genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Finally, we investigated whether the decrease in the expression level of endogenous CBP or p300 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes could affect their differentiation into adipocytes. 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt/-mut and 3T3-L1-Rzp300-wt/-mut were cultured in DM for 40 h and then cultured in post-DM. Eight days after differentiation induction, 3T3-L1-RzCBP-mut accumulated fat droplets in cells (Fig. 4 A,a). On the other hand, 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt showed a low level of accumulation of fat droplets (Fig. 4 A, b). Essentially the same results were obtained in Oil-Red O staining, by which triacylglycerides were stained red (Fig. 4 A,c and d). To confirm the low level of accumulation of lipid droplets, we determined the triacylglyceride level in the cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, e, 8 days after differentiation induction, the triacylglyceride content in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt cells was significantly lower than that in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-mut cells. As observed in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt, the lipid levels in 3T3-L1-Rzp300-wt were also significantly lower than that in 3T3-L1-Rzp300-mut (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, which is one of the biochemical markers of adipocyte differentiation, was also significantly suppressed in 3T3-L1-RzCBP-wt and in 3T3-L1-Rzp300-wt throughout the course of adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 5). Therefore, it was shown that the decrease in the expression level of endogenous CBP or p300 in the presence of the active ribozymes resulted in the suppression of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation.Figure 5Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activities were suppressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing the active CBP - or p300-specific ribozyme. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activities in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing CBP-specific (A) or p300-specific (B) ribozyme were estimated after differentiation induction. ■ a"

The interaction with Shc involves a portion of Shc not previously implicated in interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases. These results identify Src kinase and the adaptor protein Shc as key signaling intermediates in DDR2 signal transduction.

Thus far, two DDR receptors have been identified, DDR1 and DDR2. DDR1 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells in the brain, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and kidney, whereas DDR2 is expressed in interstitial cells in the heart, skeletal muscle, lung, brain, and kidney (3Alves F. Vogel W. Mossie K. Millauer B. Hofler H. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 609-618PubMed Google Scholar). DDR1 and DDR2 are differentially activated by collagens. DDR1 is activated primarily by collagen types I, II, III, V, and XI, whereas DDR2 is activated mainly by collagen types I and III (1Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M.

Cell. 1997; 91: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR receptors can be detected only after prolonged exposure to collagen (approximately 30 min), and then phosphorylation is sustained for an extended period (more than 16 h) (2Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 5Olaso E. Ikeda K. Eng F.J., Xu, L. Wang L.H. Lin H.C. Friedman S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This unique slow-on, slow-off phenomenon and receptor specificity raise important questions about the nature of downstream intracellular signals mediating the effects of DDR2. Receptor tyrosine kinases contain a catalytic domain that can autophosphorylate one or more tyrosine residues typically located in the noncatalytic region of the receptor. These phosphorylations lead to generation of docking sites for SH2 and PTB domains of signaling molecules that associate with the receptors (6Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). For example, PDGF receptor and fibroblast growth factor receptor associate with signaling molecules such as phospholipase C-γ, Src, Shc, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. However, it is still unknown which molecules interact with DDR2. In this study, we have explored intracellular pathways mediating DDR2 signaling, and report that DDR2 signaling is propagated through interaction with both the Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase and the adaptor molecule Shc. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these signals mediate transactivation of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) promoter. We used HSC-T6 cells, an activated rat hepatic stellate cell (i.e. myofibroblast) line (7Vogel S. Piantedosi R. Frank J. Lalazar A. Rockey D.C. Friedman S.L. Blaner W.S. J.

COS7 and SYF were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection. DDR2 −/− skin fibroblasts were reconstituted by retroviral infection with green fluorescent protein, wild type mouse DDR2, or a K608E point mutation to produce a kinase-dead DDR2 (9Labrador J.P.

Each cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and grown in the presence of penicillin and streptomycin. FcDDR2 and CA or DN Src were cotransfected in COS7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM serum-free medium at 37 °C for 24 h. HSC-T6 cells and COS7 cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h and then stimulated with collagen type I (Becton Dickinson) for 2 h. Cells on 10-cm diameter culture dishes were rinsed twice in PBS (4 °C) and lysed in 0.5 ml of the lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. After total cell protein in lysates from serum-starved cells was determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), antibodies were added to the cell lysates and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by precipitation on protein A-agarose beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed at 4 °C in the lysis buffer prior to direct analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (8% acrylamide gel). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to membranes overnight at 50 mA. The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% or 0.1% Tween 20) and placed in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline plus Tween containing 8% fetal calf serum or 5% milk) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated with 1:20,000 dilution of anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), 1:1,000 dilution of anti-DDR2 Ab (R2-JM, R2B), anti-Shc Ab (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-Src Ab (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound primary antibody was visualized by chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Pierce) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Rockland) or protein A (Bio-Rad) at 1:15,000 dilution. Membranes were stripped of bound antibodies by incubation in the buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 55 °C for 30 min prior to reprobing with different primary antibodies. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast reporter strain, L40, has the following genotype: MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ. L40 were grown at 30 °C in YPAD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, and 0.1 mg/ml adenine). To identify a DDR2 cytoplasmic domain interacting clone, a two-hybrid screen was performed (10Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 500-ml culture of L40 expressing the LexA-DDR2 cytoplasmic domain with Src was grown in synthetic medium lacking tryptophan to select for the bait plasmid (pBTM116[Src]-DDR2). The cells were then transformed with 500 μg of DNA derived from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH catalog no. HL4047AH). 6 × 106 transformants were obtained in the screen. The transformants were grown in liquid selective medium of 16 h at 30 °C to increase the efficiency of expression of the HIS3 reporter gene. The cells were then plated onto synthetic medium plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, uracil, and lysine. After 3 days at 30 °C, the colonies were picked and streaked for β-galactosidase filter assay. The prey plasmid DNA was isolated according to manufacturer's instructions using YEASTMAKER Yeast Plasmid Isolation kit (CLONTECH). Isolated prey plasmid DNAs were sequenced using an ABI Prism 373 automated fluorescent DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer). DNA data base searches were performed using the BLASTA program. These prey plasmid DNAs were simultaneously reintroduced into L40 in combination with either the original bait or controls (pBTM116-lamin, pBTM116[src], pBTM116-DDR2) followed by β-galactosidase assay. Constructs extending 1686 bp upstream of the translation start site of the MMP-2 gene were subcloned into the promoterless luciferase expression vector pGL2-basic (Promega) (11Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Mertens P.R. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18786-18796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In all transfections the pRL-null vector expressing the Renilla luciferase enzyme cDNA (Promega) was included to control for transfection efficiency using dual luciferase detection. Transient transfections of subconfluent cell cultures were performed with 4 μl of FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Skin fibroblasts were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of MMP-2 promoter constructs cDNA, 0.5 μg of CA or DN Src cDNA, and 15 ng of the Renilla cDNA. Cells were cultured in the presence of collagen type I with or without Src kinase inhibitor SU6656 for 24 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was assessed using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Final values were corrected for efficiency of transfection as assessed by Renilla activity. Data were expressed as mean values ± S.D. The results were analyzed according to unpaired Student's t test. To identify endogenous DDR2 expression and its signaling pathway, we initially utilized a rat hepatic stellate cell line (HSC-T6), as we previously identified DDR2 expression in this cell type by homology PCR for receptor tyrosine kinases (12Ankoma-Sey V. Matli M. Chang K.B. Lalazar A. Donner D.B. Wong L. Warren R.S. Friedman S.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured with or without collagen type I for 2 h. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates was performed using a polyclonal antibody (R2-JM) to the DDR2 juxtamembrane domain, followed by Western blot (WB) with either anti-DDR2 or an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1). Immunoprecipitation/WB for anti-DDR2 confirmed DDR2 expression with and without collagen (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2), and WB with anti-phosphotyrosine demonstrated that DDR2 is phosphorylated following exposure to type I collagen (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, WB for anti-phosphotyrosine showed another band of ∼60 kDa (Fig. 1,asterisk, lane 4). Prior to the identification of DDR2 as a collagen receptor, cell interactions with collagen had been ascribed almost exclusively to integrins, a family of heterodimeric receptors composed of α and β chains (13Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Moreover, integrin clustering by collagen activates focal adhesion kinase and its downstream signals (Src, Fyn, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, etc). Among them, Src is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase of 60 kDa. Therefore, Western blot for Src was performed after immunoprecipitation by the DDR2 antibody. This analysis indicated that Src is associated with DDR2 in stellate cells prior to stimulation with exogenous collagen (Fig. 1,lane 5), and that increased association seems to occur following collagen stimulation (Fig. 1, lane 6). No specific bands were visible when immunoprecipitation was performed with control antibody (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8). Regulation of several receptor tyrosine kinases by Src kinase has been reported (14Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To initially explore the role of Src in DDR2 activation, we tested the effect of a specific Src family kinase inhibitor, SU6656 (SUGEN) (15Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X., Wu, J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). COS 7 cells expressing recombinant DDR2 were pretreated with incremental concentrations of SU6656, followed by stimulation with type I collagen. DDR2 autophosphorylation stimulated by collagen was clearly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by SU6656 with an IC50 of ∼2 μm (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that DDR2 activation could be Src-dependent. To examine the role of Src on DDR2 activation more directly, we performed experiments in which the phosphorylation state of a constitutively dimerized form of DDR2 (FcDDR2, a dimerized DDR kinase resulting from the replacement of the DDR2 extracellular domain with the Fc region of human IgG) was analyzed in the presence of CA or DN Src. As shown in Fig. 3 D, FcDDR2 is much more active than unstimulated DDR2 and appears to be as active as fully stimulated DDR2. In COS7 cells that were cotransfected with FcDDR2 and CA Src, markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FcDDR2 was detectable (Fig. 3 A, lane 4), compared with that in COS7 cells transfected with only FcDDR2 (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Some phosphorylation was still detected in cells transfected only with FcDDR2 without CA Src, which could reflect autophosphorylation because of its dimeric structure and/or the activity of endogenous Src kinase. Importantly, the ability of Src to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR2 depends on intact kinase activity of the DDR2 receptor, because CA Src promoted much less tyrosine phosphorylation of a kinase-dead form of DDR2 (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). Thus, the catalytic activity of DDR2 and Src seem to synergistically promote tyrosine phosphorylation of DDR2. Next, COS7 cells were cotransfected with a dominant negative Src and FcDDR2, which inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of FcDDR2 compared with that in COS7 cells transfected with only FcDDR2 (Fig. 3 B). Importantly, cotransfection of dominant negative Src also inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of full-length DDR2 stimulated by type I collagen (Fig. 3 C, lanes 7 and 8). To further establish the physiological relevance of the interaction between DDR2 and Src kinase, SYF and wild type fibroblasts were stimulated by collagen type I. As shown in Fig. 4, DDR2 phosphorylation by collagen type I stimulation was delayed and decreased in SYF cells. In particular, the upper band in WB for anti-phosphotyrosine, which represents a highly phosphorylated form of DDR2, is diminished in SYF knockout cells (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8). To further explore interactions between DDR2 and Src, we next utilized the yeast two-hybrid system to clone proteins that bind to phosphorylated DDR2 cytoplasmic domain in the presence of Src kinase. The bait vector encoded the cytoplasmic domain of DDR2 (fused to LexA) but was also modified to include the expression of constitutively active Src to phosphorylate the expressed LexA-DDR2 fusion protein (Fig. 5 A). To first test whether Src tyrosine kinase induced phosphorylation of the DDR2 cytoplasmic domain in yeast, we performed an anti-phosphotyrosine blot. Lysates of yeast cells transformed with control bait (pBTM116-lamin, pBTM116[src], and pBTM116-DDR2) and cells expressing LexA-DDR2 fusion together with Src (pBTM116 [src] DDR2) were precipitated by anti-DDR2 (R2B), followed by WB with anti-DDR2, anti-LexA, and/or anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 5 A). Immunoblot with anti-DDR2 or anti-LexA demonstrated a band corresponding to the expected size of the LexA-DDR2 cytoplasmic domain fusion protein in the yeast transformed with either pBTM116-DDR2 or pBTM116[src]-DDR2 bait vector; however, phosphorylation was confined to the fusion protein co-expressed with Src kinase. To identify potential interacting prey proteins by yeast two-hybrid, we chose a commercial library from skeletal muscle cells, where DDR2 is expressed. From the ∼6 × 106 transformants that were screened with the DDR2 bait, 46 colonies were positive for transcriptional activation. Among these was a 2.5-kbp cDNA encoding part of the Shc adaptor protein. As shown in Fig. 5 B, Shc has three isoforms (46, 52, and 66 kDa) (16Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 17Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G.

The region of Shc identified by yeast two-hybrid overlapped almost exactly with CH1 and SH2 domains, which are included in all three isoforms, but surprisingly did not include the PTB domain, which has generally been involved in previously identified interaction of Shc with other receptor tyrosine kinases. To establish that Src tyrosine kinase is necessary for Shc association with DDR2, Shc was cotransformed with each control bait vector (pBTM116-lamin, pBTM116[src], or pBTM116-DDR2) to assay for complementation as assessed by β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 5 C). The LexA DDR2 cytoplasmic domain fusion protein interacted with Shc only in the presence of Src. We next investigated which domain(s) of Shc were required for interaction with DDR2. The sequences of PTB, CH1, SH2, (PTB+CH1), (CH1+SH2), and full-length Shc were inserted into the pGAD vector as an in-frame fusion with a hemagglutinin tag to create a panel of putative prey molecules. Three control bait vectors and the original vector were cotransformed with each prey vector into L40 yeast. As shown in Table I, β-galactosidase assay demonstrated that full-length Shc and (CH1+SH2) domains interacted with DDR2 in the presence of active Src kinase. This finding established that the portion of Shc containing both the (CH1+SH2) domains is the minimal region required to interact with phosphorylated DDR2. To eliminate the possibility that SH2 domain is misfolded and does not associate with DDR2 in yeast, we used a truncated mouse protein expressed in activated lymphocytes (mPAL) as a positive control bait, which is known to associates with Shc SH2 (18Schmandt R. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1867-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assay demonstrated that truncated mPAL associated with full-length Shc and Shc-SH2 (data not shown).Table IMapping of Shc domains required for interaction with the DDR2 fusion protein in yeast two-hybrid Open table in a new tab To confirm the association of Shc with DDR2 in mammalian cells, we used skin fibroblasts from DDR2 knockout mice (9Labrador J.P. Azcoitia V. Tuckermann J. Lin C. Olaso E. Manes S. Bruckner K. Goergen J.L. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G. Angel P. Martinez C. Klein R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which were reconstituted by retroviral infection with green fluorescent protein, wild type mouse DDR2, or a kinase-dead DDR2 mutant (Fig. 6). Each of these cell populations was cultured with or without collagen type I (20 μg/ml). Cells lysates were precipitated by anti-DDR2 polyclonal antibody, followed by Western blot with anti-DDR2, anti-phosphotyrosine, and/or anti-Shc. Immunoprecipitation/WB demonstrated that Shc associated with DDR2 when cells expressing wild type DDR2 were stimulated with collagen type I (Fig. 6, lane 4). Shc association with DDR2 did not occur when cells expressing the kinase-dead mutant were stimulated with collagen type I (Fig. 6, lane 6). We further investigated the requirement for Src kinase for Shc to associate with DDR2. FcDDR2 and dominant negative Src were cotransfected in COS7 cells. Cells lysates were precipitated with protein A, followed by Western blot with anti-DDR2, anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Shc. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the phosphorylated FcDDR2 was dephosphorylated by dominant negative Src. Autophosphorylated FcDDR2 associated with Shc (Fig. 7 A, lane 3), whereas FcDDR2 dephosphorylated by dominant negative Src did not support the Shc-DDR2 interaction (Fig. 7 A, lane 4). Furthermore, the Src kinase inhibitor, SU6656, partially inhibited phosphorylation of DDR2 by collagen I stimulation, while completely inhibiting Shc association with DDR2 (Fig. 7 B, lanes 4 and 5). On the other hand, FcDDR2 was highly phosphorylated by overexpressed Src, which in turn was highly associated with Shc (Fig. 8, lane 7).Figure 8A Y471F mutation reduces the association of DDR2 with Shc and Src. FcDDR2 (lanes 2 and 7), FcDDR2Y471F (lanes 3 and 8), FcDDR2KE (lanes 4 and 9), or FcDDR2KEY471F (lanes 5 and 10) were transiently expressed with (lanes 6–10) or without (lanes 1–5) wild type Src in COS7 cells. Cell lysates were precipitated by protein A, followed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-DDR2, and anti-Shc as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Y471F mutant DDR2 (lanes 3 and 8) slightly decreased its phosphorylation; however, the K608E,Y471F DDR2 double mutants (lanes 5 and 10) dramatically decreased its phosphorylation (arrowhead). Furthermore, Shc association was dramatically decreased by the Y471F mutation (arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify residues in DDR2 critical for Src/Shc interaction, we generated a Y471F mutant in the juxtamembrane region of DDR2 to investigate whether this site is critical for Src/Shc interaction based on the following reasons. 1) A data base search, by using “Scansite” of the Division of Signal Transduction, Harvard Institutes of Medicine (scansite.mit.edu/), identified Tyr-471 as a candidate tyrosine critical for the Src/Shc interaction. 2) Src binds to phosphotyrosine residues in the juxtamembrane region of other RTKs like PDGF-R α and β (19Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). 3) DDR1 associates with the Shc PTB domain at a similar residue in its juxtamembrane region (20Vogel W. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S77-S82Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding a point mutation of Y471F and double point mutations of K608E and Y471F of FcDDR2 were cotransfected with or without wild type Src in COS7 cells. Cell lysates were precipitated with protein A, followed by Western blot with anti-DDR2, anti-phosphotyrosine, and anti-Shc. The Y471F mutation of FcDDR2 moderately decreased DDR2 phosphorylation with or without Src. However, the K608E and Y471F double mutation of FcDDR2 dramatically decreased phosphorylation by 90%. Although Shc association with DDR2 was dependent on Src, it was also decreased by the Y471F mutation. The Y471F mutation decreased its association with Shc by 70%. The K608E/Y471F double mutations reduced Shc association by 90% (Fig. 8). To explore the biological consequences of DDR2 signaling and the role of Src kinase, we examined whether DDR2 stimulation by Src up-regulated the promoter activity of MMP-2, which we have recently identified as a downstream target of DDR2 (21Olaso E. Labrador P. Wang L. Ikeda K. Eng F.J. Klein R. Lovett D.H. Lin H.C. Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3606-3613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To do so, DDR2 −/− or DDR2 +/− skin fibroblasts were transiently cotransfected with CA or DN Src expression plasmid and a luciferase reporter cDNA, which incorporates 1686 bp upstream of the translation start site of the MMP-2 gene. Cells were cultured in the presence of collagen type I with or without Src kinase inhibitor, SU6656 for 24 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 9, MMP-2 promoter activity in DDR2 +/− cells was 10 times higher than that in DDR2 −/− cells. Furthermore, it was significantly up-regulated by CA Src and down-regulated by DN Src or SU6656 in DDR2 +/− cells. A similar effect on MMP-2 promoter activity was also identified in COS7 cells, which were cotransfected with pMT21 plasmid with or without wild type DDR2. Adhesion to extracellular matrices and to other cells is mediated by a diverse family of receptors, the best characterized being integrins (13Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar), cadherins (22Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), selectins (23Rosen S.D. Bertozzi C.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and cell adhesion molecules (24Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). Src kinases have been implicated in adhesion events regulated by these receptors (25Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Src family kinases also communicate with many different RTKs (14Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The biochemical connections between these different receptors and Src family kinases include phosphorylation of Src family kinase, association with the RTK, activation of Src kinases, and phosphorylation of the RTK. Interestingly, the DDR family of RTKs have recently been found to represent a new receptor class that responds to the extracellular matrix in particular by binding collagen (1Shrivastava A. Radziejewski C. Campbell E. Kovac L. McGlynn M. Ryan T.E. Davis S. Goldfarb M.P. Glass D.J. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G.D. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 2Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between DDRs and other classes of matrix receptors, as well as the sharing of downstream signaling pathways such as Src, must be explored. In this study, we have shown that endogenously expressed DDR2 receptors in an activated hepatic stellate cell line (HSC-T6) are associated with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Src is requisite for maximal DDR2 tyrosine phosphorylation and leads to additional association with the adaptor molecule Shc, resulting in increased MMP-2 promoter activity. There is minimal information about downstream signaling molecules for DDR receptors. Shc has recently been shown to associate with DDR1 (2Vogel W. Gish G.D. Alves F. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), although the interacting region of Shc for DDR1 differs from that used by Shc for DDR2. Shc is expressed as three alternatively spliced adapter proteins, which share an N-terminal PTB domain, a central glycine sequence, and C-terminal SH2 domain as shown in Fig. 5 B. Shc proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated by receptor tyrosine kinases and bind to phosphotyrosine residues on those receptors. The b isoform of DDR1 has an additional 37-amino acid sequence inserted by alternative splicing into the juxtamembrane domain containing an L XNP XY sequence (26Vogel W. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Alves F. Ruggiero F. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5779-5784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Upon collagen-mediated receptor activation, the tyrosine in the L XNP XY sequence becomes phosphorylated, providing a binding site for PTB domain of Shc. In contrast, we find by yeast two-hybrid system that DDR2 associates with CH1-SH2 domains of Shc but not its PTB, because the portion of Shc containing both the CH1+SH2 domains is the minimal region required to interact with phosphorylated DDR2. Consistent with DDR2 interacting with non-PTB portion of Shc, DDR2 lacks the NPXY site by which Shc PTB domain has been shown to bind DDR1 and other receptors. We additionally establish that phosphorylation of DDR2 receptor is necessary for association with Src, and that the Tyr-239/Tyr-240 residues in the CH1 domain of Shc are also phosphorylated by Src (27van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Shc phosphorylation at tyrosine residues in the CH1 domain (Tyr-239, Tyr-240, and Tyr-317) may also be necessary for the association with DDR2, particularly because these residues are preserved in all three isoforms of Shc (17Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). We have identified Tyr-471 as a critical phosphotyrosine residue of DDR2 required for Shc interaction, among the 14 tyrosines in the intracellular domain. As shown in Fig. 8, a Y471F mutation and/or kinase-dead K608E dramatically decreased Shc association; however, it did not totally inhibit the association, which suggests there are still other minor association sites with Shc. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc can recruit Grb2/Sos through a binding event between the Grb2 SH2 domain and Shc phosphotyrosine residues, ultimately resulting in activation of Ras, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade, and mitogenesis (28Sternberg P.W. Alberola-Ila J. Cell. 1998; 95: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have recently observed that fibroblasts in DDR2 −/− mice have a reduced proliferative response compared with wild type littermates in a skin wound healing model (9Labrador J.P. Azcoitia V. Tuckermann J. Lin C. Olaso E. Manes S. Bruckner K. Goergen J.L. Lemke G. Yancopoulos G. Angel P. Martinez C. Klein R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus far, we do not have evidence implicating DDR2 in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. We have recently demonstrated a marked decrease in MMP-2 expression in DDR−/− fibroblasts compared with DDR2 +/− cells (21Olaso E. Labrador P. Wang L. Ikeda K. Eng F.J. Klein R. Lovett D.H. Lin H.C. Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3606-3613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed an MMP-2 promoter assay in the presence of CA or DN Src in each of these cell types. MMP-2 promoter activity in DDR2 +/− cells was significantly higher than that in DDR2 −/− cells, and in DDR2 +/− cells was further up-regulated by CA Src but down-regulated by DN Src or Src kinase inhibitor, SU6656. Prior to the identification of DDR2 as a collagen receptor, cell interactions with collagen had been ascribed primarily to integrins, a family of heterodimeric receptors composed of α and β chains, which, among other activities, can up-regulate MMP-2 (29Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1635-1641PubMed Google Scholar). It seems possible that integrins and DDR2 are co-localized and aggregated as they hold collagen as a common ligand, which may enable their signaling pathways to converge downstream. Our findings support this notion by demonstrating that the Src pathway, already known to be involved downstream of integrin signaling, is requisite for maximal DDR2 tyrosine phosphorylation and for engagement of the Shc adaptor protein. However, we could not establish a direct relationship between integrins and the DDR2 signaling pathway (data not shown). Emerging insights into DDR2 signaling pathways will be critical to understanding how this receptor system interacts with other matrix receptors, as well as the as-yet-unclear role of this receptor in mediating cellular responses to matrix molecules in its environment.

In fat and muscle cells, IRAP colocalizes with the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in intracellular vesicles and redistributes to the cell surface in response to insulin, as GLUT4 does. To address the question of the physiological function of IRAP, we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the IRAP gene (IRAP−/−). Herein, we describe the characterization of these mice with regard to glucose homeostasis and regulation of GLUT4. Fed and fasted blood glucose and insulin levels in the IRAP−/− mice were normal. Whereas IRAP−/− mice responded to glucose administration like control mice, they exhibited an impaired response to insulin. Basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in extensor digitorum longus muscle, and adipocytes isolated from IRAP−/− mice were decreased by 30–60% but were normal for soleus muscle from male IRAP−/− mice. Total GLUT4 levels were diminished by 40–85% in the IRAP−/− mice in the different muscles and in adipocytes. The relative distribution of GLUT4 in subcellular fractions of basal and insulin-stimulated IRAP−/− adipocytes was the same as in control cells. We conclude that IRAP−/− mice maintain normal glucose homeostasis despite decreased glucose uptake into muscle and fat cells. The absence of IRAP does not affect the subcellular distribution of GLUT4 in adipocytes. However, it leads to substantial decreases in GLUT4 expression.

The results from these studies showed that IRAP behaves almost identically to GLUT4. Under basal conditions, IRAP and GLUT4 are efficiently sequestered in intracellular membrane compartments. When cells are treated with insulin, IRAP and GLUT4 translocate to the plasma membrane. In adipocytes, this results in an 8- and 10–20-fold increase of IRAP and GLUT4, respectively, at the cell surface (4Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Morris N.J. Leung W.-Y. Mao F. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. J.

NEJM. 1999; 341: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), the regulation of the subcellular distribution of GLUT4 is key to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. The physiological function of IRAP and the implication of its differential subcellular distribution under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, however, are unknown. The cloning of IRAP revealed that it is a member of the family of zinc-dependent aminopeptidases (14Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23612-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). IRAP's closest relatives in this family, the mammalian membrane aminopeptidases A and N, were known to process peptide hormones in vitro (15Ward P.E. Benter I.F. Dick L. Wilk S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 1725-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Ahmad S. Ward P.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 252: 643-650PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies in mice using specific inhibitors for the two aminopeptidases support their role in the processing of angiotensin II and III, respectively, in vivo (17Zini S. Fournie-Zaluski M.-C. Chauvel E. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 11968-11973Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that IRAP removes the N-terminal amino acids from vasopressin, Lys-bradykinin, and angiotensins III and IV efficiently (18Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Bobin S.A. Morris N.J. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E600-E606PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin itself is not a substrate. Angiotensins III and IV are also well cleaved by aminopeptidase N (17Zini S. Fournie-Zaluski M.-C. Chauvel E. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 11968-11973Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 19Lalu K. Lampelo S. Vanha-Perttula T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 873: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, vasopressin, with its N-terminal cystine, was known to be cleaved only by the human placental leucine aminopeptidase/oxytocinase (P-LAP) (19Lalu K. Lampelo S. Vanha-Perttula T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 873: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cloning of P-LAP revealed that it is 87% identical to IRAP at the amino acid level (20Rogi T. Tsujimoto M. Nakazato H. Mizutani S. Tomoda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 56-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, P-LAP cleaves vasopressin and angiotensin IV, as well as oxytocin (21Tsujimoto M. Mizutani S. Adachi H. Kimura M. Nakazato H. Tomada Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Whether the peptides cleaved by IRAP and P-LAP in vitro are also in vivo substrates has not been established. The aminopeptidases homologous to IRAP are constitutively expressed at the cell surface and so have continued access to their extracellular substrates (22Kenny J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1986; 11: 40-42Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). IRAP, however, was expected to process its extracellular substrates only after translocation to the cell surface. In support of this, we have found that insulin, concomitant with the translocation of IRAP to the plasma membrane, increases aminopeptidase activity toward extracellular vasopressin in isolated adipocytes (18Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Bobin S.A. Morris N.J. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E600-E606PubMed Google Scholar). The cloning of IRAP and characterization of it as an aminopeptidase that can process regulatory peptide hormones revealed thus a hitherto unrecognized possible action of insulin, the potential to modify, through IRAP, the action of other peptide hormones and thus broaden its own spectrum of action. This mode of action may not be restricted to insulin. It has been shown that endothelin-1 recruits IRAP to the plasma membrane in adipocytes and cardiomyocytes (23Wu-Wong J.R. Berg C.E. Wang J.

IRAP is well expressed in all major tissues with the exception of liver, where its expression levels are low (14Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23612-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that stimulation of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells with oxytocin leads to the translocation of IRAP to the cell surface (25Nakamura H. Itakuara A.

To address the question of the function of IRAP in a physiological context, we have generated mice with a targeted disruption of the IRAP gene (referred to as IRAP−/− mice). We first tested these mice for defects in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, a major insulin action that is dependent on the proper regulation of GLUT4. Genomic clones containing fragments of the IRAP gene were isolated from a mouse embryonic stem cell genomic P1 library (mouse strain 129) by PCR screening with two primers derived from the rat IRAP cDNA (5′-GTCTTGGTGAGCATGAGATGG-3′ and 5′-CTAAGGTCCTGGCAGAGGGTA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 241–261 and 385–405, respectively (14Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23612-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar)) by Genome Systems Inc. The genomic clones were analyzed by restriction digestions, Southern blotting, and sequencing, and a detailed exon-intron map of the IRAP gene was obtained. 2S. R. Keller, manuscript in preparation. Based on this information, a targeting vector was constructed as follows (Fig. 1 A). An XhoI (blunt-ended)-Hin dIII genomic IRAP fragment corresponding to 3.8 kb of intron sequence with its 3′-end 0.4 kb upstream of exon 2 was cloned into the ClaI (blunt-ended)-Hin dIII restriction sites in the vector pPol II long neo bpA 5′ to the neomycin resistance cassette. The neomycin resistance gene in this cassette is oriented such that transcription proceeds in the opposite direction to the introduced IRAP sequences. A 5.6-kb XhoI-ClaI (blunt-ended) restriction fragment of IRAP genomic DNA with its 5′-end 0.5 kb downstream of exon 6 and its 3′-end 2 kb downstream of exon 8 was inserted into the XhoI and EcoRI (blunt-ended) restriction sites in the vector downstream of the neomycin resistance cassette and upstream of the thymidine kinase gene. The thymidine kinase gene was derived from the pMC1TK vector. Correct insertion of the fragments in the targeting construct was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing of the junctions. The targeting vector was linearized with SrfI and introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells (from strain 129 SvEv) by electroporation. Embryonic stem cell clones were selected for resistance to G418. Genomic DNA was isolated from resistant clones, digested with XbaI, and screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting. The 1032-bp probe used for screening was derived from exon 9 and 0.5 kb of intron sequence upstream and 0.35 kb of intron sequence downstream of exon 9 and was labeled with dUTP-digoxigenin by PCR (primers 5′-CAAGCTCAGTCTGGAGTCTTAGTG-3′ and 5′-GATTCACAGGGCTTCATAGAGAC-3′). The hybridized probe was detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Bio-chemicals). Of the 384 clones analyzed, three showed the expected fragments of 12 and 8.5 kb characteristic for the endogenous intact and the disrupted IRAP allele, respectively (see Fig. 1 B). The XbaI-digested genomic DNA of these three clones was also hybridized with a 783-bp dUTP-digoxigenin-labeled probe that was obtained by PCR with primers derived from the neomycin resistance gene (5′-GGGATCGGCCATTGAACAAG-3′ and 5′-AAGGCGATAGAAGGCGATGC-3′) to test for correct recombination between the 5′ homologous IRAP region in the targeting vector and the endogenous IRAP. All three clones showed the expected 8-kb XbaI fragment (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). One of these clones was injected into blastocysts derived from Black Swiss mice, and the blastocysts were implanted into pseudopregnant recipients. Male chimeric offspring were bred with wild type Black Swiss female mice (Taconic). In the agouti offspring, germ line transmission of the mutant IRAP allele was identified by Southern blotting of genomic DNA obtained from tail snips. The dUTP-digoxigenin-labeled IRAP probe was used as described above and marked in Fig. 1 A. Six male and female mice heterozygous for the mutant IRAP allele (IRAP+/−) were bred to obtain the IRAP null (IRAP−/−) together with wild type (IRAP+/+) and heterozygous (IRAP+/−) mice. The mice were genotyped by Southern blotting as described above. Representative results from Southern blots are shown in Fig. 1 B. Nine male and female IRAP−/− mice as well as eight male and female IRAP+/+ mice were paired, and the offspring from these breeding pairs were used for all of the experiments described below unless stated otherwise. Offspring from different breeding pairs for each genotype were used in each experiment to assure equal representation of the different mixed genetic pools obtained through the breeding of the outbred Black Swiss with the inbred 129 SvEv mice. The mice were housed under a constant light (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) and dark cycle and fed Teklad LM 485 mouse/rat diet (Harlan Teklad) with free access to water.

In the mEST structure with both PAP and E2, conserved residues Ser138 and Lys48 directly interact with the 3′- and 5′-phosphate of the PAP molecule, respectively, whereas the conserved His108 directly coordinates to the acceptor group of the 17β-estradiol (E2) molecule, suggesting it to be the catalytic base. The crystal structure in the presence of PAP and orthovanadate mimics the transition state of the transfer reaction in which the lysine residue directly coordinates to the bridging oxygen of the 5′-phosphate of the PAP (5Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This coordination suggested that the lysine could be a catalytic residue participating in the dissociation of the sulfate group from PAPS. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have confirmed the functional importance of this residue in various sulfotransferase enzymes (5Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved serine has been shown to abrogate the activity of human natural killer cell-1 sulfotransferase (13Ong E. Yeh J.-C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Pedersen L.C.

Despite the apparent functional importance, the structural implication of the conserved serine is not clear at this time. In all known crystal structures, the conserved serine forms a hydrogen bond with the 3′-phosphate of the PAP molecule and is away from the 5′-phosphate group where the transfer occurs. Previous structures provided no evidence for the involvement of the serine residue in catalysis, although the interaction with the 3′-phosphate group suggested that it might be conserved for the specific binding of PAPS. The lack of a sulfotransferase structure with the active donor PAPS has limited our understanding of the reaction mechanism and the roles conserved residues like the serine might play in catalysis. We have now crystallized the V269E mutant (a surface mutation) of hEST in the presence of PAPS. This hEST mutant converts the enzyme from a dimer to a monomer in solution but has no observable effect on the activity (14Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Brochers C.H. Tomer K.B. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All residues involved in interacting directly with the donor and acceptor substrates are found to be conserved in the hEST as observed in the crystal structures of mEST (4Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However in the hEST-PAPS structure, a conformational change in the position of Lys47is observed. In this structure, Lys47 forms a hydrogen bond with Ser137 instead of with the bridging oxygen between the 5′-phosphate and the sulfate group of PAPS. Complemented with site-directed mutagenesis studies on Ser137 and His107, we herein present experimental evidence that leads us to propose the reaction mechanism in which the 3′-phosphate-Ser interaction helps regulates the action of the lysine in controlling the dissociation of the 5′-sulfate group from PAPS in the absence of substrate. Upon binding of substrate and initiation of catalysis by His107, Lys47 undergoes a conformational change and interacts with the bridging oxygen of the phosphate-sulfate bond of PAPS to promote the dissociation of the PAP leaving group. A hEST cDNA, kindly provided by Charles Falany, was cloned into pGEX-4T3 plasmid. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Each recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21DE3 cell, and the expressed recombinant enzyme was bound on glutathione-Sepharose from which the pure enzyme was eluted by thrombin digestion. For crystallization, the purified enzyme was then washed over a bensoyl-Sepharose microcolumn followed by extensive dialysis against 0.5 mmNaH2PO4 and 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.2. The crystals of hEST were obtained using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique. Protein concentrated at 15 mg/ml in 0.5 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, and 4 mm PAP (Sigma), pH 7.2, was mixed in equal volume with 0.1m MES, pH 6.0, and 18% polyethylene glycol 8000 and then placed at 20 °C. Typical crystals appeared after 10 days and grew to 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.02 mm after one month. For data collection, crystals were transferred into the cold room at 4 °C. After the temperature in the drop equilibrated, the crystals were transferred three times into 60 μl of 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, 22% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 10 mm PAPS and allowed to sit for 4 h. Crystals were then transferred in four steps of increasing ethylene glycol concentration until a final concentration of 15% ethylene glycol in the soaking solution was obtained. Crystals were frozen in the nitrogen stream at −180 °C. Data were collected on a RaxisIV image plate detector with a RU3H-rotating anode generator. All data were processed using Denzo and Scalepack (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure factor phases were determined by molecular replacement using the program AmoRe (16Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-168Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The hEST crystals obtained were from the mutant V269E. A monomer of mEST coordinates with a PDB identification of 1AQU was used as the initial search model against data from the V269E mutant in complex with PAP crystal. The V269E structure was refined with multiple cycles of model building using the program “O” (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeledgaard M.

These coordinates were then used as a starting model for the structures reported here, which were refined and built in a similar fashion (Table I). The quality of the models was checked using Procheck (19Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The position of Lys47 was confirmed using Fo− Fc, 2 Fo −Fc, and Fo −Fc difference maps as well as omit maps. In addition, the Lys residue was modeled and refined in both orientations to determine the correct side chain orientation. The PDB identifier code is 1HY3 for these coordinates.Table ICrystallographic data statisticsData setPAP + estradiolPAPSUnit cell dimensionsa = 61.64, b = 96.65, c = 62.79a = 61.93, b = 97.26, c = 62.73α = 90 °, β = 92.70 °, γ = 90 °α = 90 °, β = 91.13 °, γ = 90 °Space groupP21P21No. of observations81,110182,966Unique reflections25,47263,064Rsym (%) (last shell)1-aRsym = ΣhΣi‖Ii(h) − <I(h)>‖/ΣhΣiIi(h).7.8 (33.0)4.9 (22.9)I/ςI (last shell)12.5 (2.7)12.87 (2.2)Mosaicity0.680.62Completeness (%) (last shell)98.3 (86.8)91.8 (52.1)Refinement statisticsResolution (Å)50–2.550–1.8Rcryst(%)1-aRsym = ΣhΣi‖Ii(h) − <I(h)>‖/ΣhΣiIi(h).18.7019.7Rfree22.521.7No. of waters2684501.

PAPS (Sigma) was purified through MonoQ HR 5/5 column using 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m). A previously published method (20Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Chae K. Song W.C. Leblanc D. London R. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used to measure estrogen sulfotransferase activity and to calculate Km of PAPS and kcatof sulfation. To assay PAPS hydrolysis, the mixture containing enzyme and excess pure PAPS in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. 25 μl of aliquot of the reaction mixtures was separated on MonoQ HR 5/5 column using the chromatographic conditions mentioned above. Molar extinction coefficients of 15,400 (at 259 nm) and 53,340 (at 280 nm) were used for the quantitative determination of PAPS (also PAP) and hEST, respectively. The crystal structures of hEST have now been solved in the presence of PAPS and of PAP and E2. The protein structure of hEST is a classical sulfotransferase-fold. The main core of the molecule is composed of an α/β motif. This motif contains a β sheet comprised of five parallel β-strands surrounded by α-helices on both sides and a conserved helix running across the top of the fold. This portion of the molecule contains the conserved 5′-phosphosulfate-binding (PSB)-loop and helix 6 that constitute the binding site for the donor substrate PAPS molecule. A noncrystallographic 2-fold rotation axis relating the two molecules in the asymmetric unit places the loops from the two molecules containing residues 265–275 in close contact. These loops form the identical interaction as seen in human hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase and human aryl sulfotransferase 3 crystals that has been implicated to be the physiological dimerization interface (14Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Brochers C.H. Tomer K.B. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Apparently, the V269E mutation did not prevent the hEST from forming the proper dimer in the crystal lattice. The C-α trace of the acceptor substrate-binding pocket of hEST is very similar to that of mEST (4Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These substrate-binding pockets accommodate the E2 molecule in the same orientation. The side chains from residues Lys105 and His107 form hydrogen bonds with the acceptor hydroxyl of the E2 molecule as is also seen in the mEST structures (4Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The major differences in the substrate-binding site occur near the 17β-hydroxyl group end of the E2 molecule. This region is represented by the amino acid substitutions from mEST to hEST: Tyr20 to Asp21, His148 to Try149, Ile246 to Met247, Asp22 to Arg23, Met89 to Ile90, Leu242 to Met243, and Lys85 to Asn86. Within this region of the hEST structure, a stretch of protein from Val145 to Ser153, appears to have a slightly different conformation from that of mEST and appears to have collapsed slightly on the substrate. The PAP portion of PAPS molecule in the hEST-PAPS structure superimposes well with the PAP molecules in the hEST-PAP-E2 structure. The hEST-PAPS crystal structure reveals the key catalytic residues that coordinate with the sulfate moiety (Fig. 1). The atom O2S of the sulfate group is in position to form a hydrogen bond with NE2 of His107 (3.2 Å) and the backbone amide from Lys47 (3.0 Å). The sulfate coordination to these residues is similar to that of the vanadate molecule as observed in the structure of the mEST-PAP-orthovanadate (5Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The sulfur atom is located 2.8 Å from the acceptor 3-phenolic group of the E2 molecule when the hEST-PAPS structure is superimposed with the hEST-PAP-E2 structure (Fig. 2). The position of the sulfate group with respect to the acceptor substrate molecule in this superposition is consistent with the proposed in-line transfer reaction mechanism based on the geometry.Figure 2Superposition of the hEST-PAPS structure with the hEST-PAP-E2 structure.

The NZ atom of Lys47 interacts with the leaving oxygen of 5′-phosphate group in the PAP bound structures as previously observed in the other structures (4Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 7Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The last torsion angle of the lysine has changed considerably in the hEST-PAPS structure compared with those in the PAP-bound structure. As a result, the NZ of Lys47 is found to coordinate to the side chain oxygen of Ser137 in the PAPS bound structure (2.8 Å) and not to the bridging oxygen between the 5′-phosphate and sulfate groups of the PAPS molecule. In addition, the position of two water molecules has also been affected by the position of Lys47. A Fo −Fc omit map clearly shows the position of the lysine side chain in the PAPS structure (Fig. 3). A Fo −Fc Fourier difference map was also calculated for the PAPS structure with Lys47 modeled and refined in the PAP-E2 bound conformation. The negative density at the position of the NZ atom as well as the position of the positive density peak provides additional evidence supporting that the position of the lysine side chain in the PAPS-bound structure is modeled correctly (Fig. 3). The difference in the conformation of Lys47 may be because of a charge difference on the bridging oxygen between the 5′-phosphate and sulfate moiety. The effective charge on the 5′-phosphate of PAP is −2. However, the charge on the same phosphate in PAPS is −1. In the PAP-bound structure, there is a significant negative charge at the position of the bridging oxygen because the oxygen is not binding a sulfuryl group. Because there is no negative charge accumulated on the bridging oxygen in the PAPS molecule, the NZ of Lys47interacts with the OG atom of Ser137 that also forms a hydrogen bond with the negatively charged 3′-phosphate of the PAPS molecule. The direct interaction of Ser137 with the catalytic residue Lys47 supports a possible catalytic role for Ser137 as well. The conserved lysine (e.g. Lys47 in hEST) is implicated as a catalytic residue that assists in the dissociation of the sulfate group from PAPS during the sulfotransferase reaction (4Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 5Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 1056-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For example, we previously showed that the mutation of the corresponding Lys48 to methionine completely abolished estrogen sulfotransferase activity of the mEST, whereas the mESTK48R mutant retained a significant degree of the residual activity (5Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Complementing the crystal structure of the mEST-PAP-vanadate complex that mimicked the transient state of the sulfuryl transfer reaction, these site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that the role of the conserved lysine in catalysis is to act as a proton donor to the leaving PAP group (5Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In light of the fact that the side chain nitrogen of Lys47 coordinates to Ser137 and not to the bridging oxygen in the PAPS-bound structure, we hypothesized that the side chain interaction of Lys47 with Ser137 may regulate the catalytic activity of Lys47. To test this hypothesis, Ser137 of hEST was mutated to alanine or cysteine, and the mutated enzymes were analyzed for the PAPS hydrolysis (Fig. 4). First, the Km of PAPS for estrogen sulfotransferase activity was measured for the mutants to select the PAPS concentration used for the determination of kcat.hydrolysis. Subsequently, PAPS hydrolysis of the wild-type and mutated enzymes was measured in the presence of 2–10-fold higher PAPS concentration than their Km of PAPS values. High PAPS concentration would help minimize the effect different mutations have on the rates of catalysis upon change in the binding affinity for PAPS. The hEST mutants profoundly increased their Km of PAPS values (Table II). This finding suggested that that Ser137 was critical for the binding of PAPS to the enzyme, which was consistent with its direct binding to the 3′-phosphate group of the PAPS molecule. The possible role of Ser137 in regulating the catalytic function of Lys47 was better correlated with Kcat of PAPS. Based on the kcat of hydrolysis, the hESTS137Amutant increased PAPS hydrolysis ∼6-fold compared with the wild-type enzyme, whereas the hESTT137C mutant displayed ∼2-fold greater hydrolysis (Table II). Thus, the conservation of Ser137 may be to discourage hydrolysis in the absence of the substrate. Concomitant with the kcat of hydrolysis increase, the mutations also increased kcat for estrogen sulfotransferase activity of the enzymes. These results indicate that Ser137 is capable of regulating the hydrolysis as well as the sulfation of the substrate. Because Ser137 does not directly interact with the bridging oxygen between the 5′-phosphate and sulfate groups of the PAPS molecule, Ser137 may regulate the dissociation through its side chain interaction with Lys47. Removing or weakening the interaction with Ser137 could possibly cause the side chain of Lys47 to adopt a more favorable position coordinating to the bridging oxygen in the order of hESTS137A → hESTS137C → wild-type hEST. These mutations suggest that this Ser137, which is not found near the 5′-phosphate or sulfate moieties, can regulate the hydrolysis and sulfotransferase activity of the enzyme. Taken these mutation studies into consideration, the crystal structures are consistent with a reaction scheme whereby this regulation is carried out though the interactions of Ser137 with Lys47.Table IICatalytic properties of the wild-type and mutated hEST enzymesEnzymeKm of PAPSkcatof sulfationkcat of hydrolysisμms−1min−1Wild-type0.66 ± 0.20.020 ± 0.0040.019 ± 0.096S137C336 ± 290.045 ± 0.0050.030 ± 0.042S137A26.5 ± 6.50.123 ± 0.0120.121 ± 0.039H107NndndndThe sulfotransferase activity was measured as described previously, and a previously reported method was used to calculate the Km of PAPS and kcat of sulfation values (20Kakuta Y.

For the transfer reaction to proceed, the side chain of Lys47 should switch from interacting with Ser137 to interacting with the bridging oxygen during catalysis. The question remains as to what promotes this conformational switch? One possibility is that the binding of E2 could cause a structural alteration that would influence the side chain position of Lys47. However, no other significant structural change is observed upon binding E2. Another possibility is that an electrostatic change in the local environment of the lysine could dictate the switch. In the transfer reaction, the catalytic base histidine deprotonates the acceptor 3-hydroxyl of the E2 molecule and increases the nucleophilic character of this hydroxyl group. Subsequently, the nucleophilic acceptor group attacks the sulfur atom, which builds up a partial negative charge on the bridging oxygen of the PAPS molecule. This charge accumulation may be enough to alter the electrostatic equilibrium of the lysine from interacting with the serine to interacting with the 5′-phosphate. To examine this possibility, His107 was mutated to asparagine to resemble histidine without the negative charge, and the enzymatic characteristics of the mutant were analyzed. Unlike previous alanine mutants that were unstable (5Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Marsolais F. Varin L. Eur. J.

Acta. 1996; 1296: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the hESTH107N mutant was expressed as a soluble protein to as high a level as the wild-type enzyme in E. coli cells. The mutant was subjected to enzyme assays for estrogen sulfotransferase and PAPS hydrolysis activities. No detectable activity was observed with the hESTH107N mutant for both sulfotransferase and hydrolysis, confirming the absolute requirement of His107 for catalysis (Table II). These results suggest that the action of the catalytic histidine is essential for the side chain nitrogen of Lys47 to switch from Ser137 to the bridging oxygen and to advance the catalysis. Taken all structural features and mutational analyses together, the proposed in-line displacement reaction mechanism is depicted in Fig. 5. The conserved serine plays an important role in controlling PAPS hydrolysis activity of sulfotransferase. The binding of PAPS to the enzyme elicits Ser137 to form an interaction with Lys47. This Ser-Lys interaction removes the side chain nitrogen of Lys47 from the bridging oxygen, preventing PAPS hydrolysis. Upon binding of E2 substrate, His107 makes the 3-phenol group a better nucleophile that attacks the sulfur atom, thus building up a partial negative charge on the bridging oxygen. The negative charge then drives the positively charged side chain of Lys47 to switch to the bridging oxygen, thereby aiding in sulfate dissociation and transfer by stabilizing the transition state and possibly donating the proton to the bridging oxygen. Thus, a principle of this reaction can be viewed as charge redistribution on a coordination chain starting from the 3′-phosphate of PAPS molecule to the bridging oxygen between the 5′-phosphate and sulfate group. The key residues, serine, lysine, and histidine, appear to act in concert to regulate the charge redistribution, thus advancing the transfer reaction.

Lee Pedersen (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and Lee Bartolotti (North Carolina Supercomputer Center) for valuable discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2050828894,"Surface ultraviolet-B radiation and atmospheric CO2 concentrations have increased as a result of ozone depletion and burning of fossil fuels1,2. The effects are likely to be most apparent in polar regions3 where ozone holes have developed and ecosystems are particularly sensitive to disturbance4. Polar plant communities are dependent on nutrient cycling by soil microorganisms, which represent a significant and highly labile portion of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). It was thought5 that the soil microbial biomass was unlikely to be affected by exposure of their associated plant communities to increased UV-B. In contrast, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations were thought to have a strong effect as a result of greater below-ground C allocation6. In addition, there is a growing belief that ozone depletion is of only minor environmental concern because the impacts of UV-B radiation on plant communities are often very subtle7. Here we show that 5 years of exposure of a subarctic heath to enhanced UV-B radiation both alone and in combination with elevated CO2 resulted in significant changes in the C:N ratio and in the bacterial community structure of the soil microbial biomass."
https://openalex.org/W2009078371,"Folding and post-translational modification of the thyroid hormone precursor, thyroglobulin (Tg), in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the thyroid epithelial cells is facilitated by several molecular chaperones and folding enzymes, such as BiP, GRP94, calnexin, protein disulfide isomerase, ERp72, and others. They have been shown to associate simultaneously and/or sequentially with Tg in the course of its maturation, thus forming large heterocomplexes in the ER of thyrocytes. Here we present evidence that such complexes include a novel member, an ER-resident lumenal protein, ERp29, which is present in all mammalian tissues with exceptionally high levels of expression in the secretory cells.

Chemical cross-linking followed by the cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of ERp29 or Tg revealed association of these proteins and additionally, immunocomplexes that also included major ER chaperones, BiP and GRP94. Sucrose density gradient analysis indicated co-localization of ERp29 with Tg and BiP in the fractions containing large macromolecular complexes. This was supported by immunofluorescent microscopy showing co-localization of ERp29 with Tg in the putative transport vesicular structures.

BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and enamel cells (7.Demmer J. Zhou C. Hubbard M.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the ERp29 gene was shown to be highly conserved in all studied mammalian species (3.Mkrtchian S. Fang C. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4.Hubbard M.J. McHugh N.J. Carne D.L. Eur. J.

Gene. 2002; 285: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For instance, rat ERp29 and its human ortholog, originally termed ERp28 (8.Ferrari D.M. Nguyen Van P. Kratzin H.D. Soling H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), are 90% identical on the amino acid sequence level (9.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure. 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).ERp29 consists of two domains of which the N-terminal domain of ERp29 resembles the thioredoxin module of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), although without the active site double cysteines, indicating the lack of PDI-like redox function (9.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure. 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain represents a novel all-helical fold that is absent in human PDI but found in the P5-like PDIs and also in the Drosophila analog of ERp29, Windbeutel (10.Konsolaki M. Schupbach T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The function of this domain remains unclear, although its C-terminal sequence, KEEL, which is a conserved variant of the ER retrieval signal, KDEL (11.Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar), most probably confers ER retention to ERp29.Recently the ERp29 gene has been shown to be activated upon the treatment of rat thyroid epithelial cells by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (12.Kwon O.Y. Park S. Lee W. You K.H. Kim H. Shong M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The latter is essential for the optimal growth of thyrocytes and expression of thyroid-specific genes including the gene encoding a thyroid prohormone thyroglobulin (Tg), a 660-kDa homodimeric secretory protein (13.Ekholm R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 120: 243-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The proper folding and assembly of the transport-competent Tg dimers is controlled by the major ER molecular chaperones and folding enzymes, such as BiP, GRP94, calnexin, ERp72, and PDI. Simultaneous and/or sequential interactions of Tg with such helper proteins lead to the transient formation of the large macromolecular heterocomplexes in the ER (14.Arvan P. Kim P.S. Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Muresan Z. Yoo S.E. Abu Hossain S. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15.Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A high level of ERp29 gene expression in thyrocytes (5.Sargsyan E. Baryshev M. Backlund M. Sharipo A. Mkrtchian S. Gene. 2002; 285: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and its transcriptional regulation by TSH (12.Kwon O.Y. Park S. Lee W. You K.H. Kim H. Shong M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggested that ERp29 may be implicated, along with other ER chaperones, in the maturation and/or secretion of Tg. Therefore we carried out immunoprecipitation of ERp29 and Tg, sucrose density gradient fractionation of the cross-linked thyrocytes, and affinity chromatography on the denatured Tg-Sepharose, which indicated involvement of ERp29 in the heterogeneous Tg folding complexes. Moreover, we found co-localization of ERp29 with Tg in the putative intracellular transport structures as evidenced by immunofluorescence microscopy and, additionally, secretion of considerable amounts of ERp29 from thyrocytes. These findings for the first time suggest a distinct function for ERp29 connected with the folding and/or export of secretory proteins.DISCUSSIONA hypothetical involvement of ERp29 in the processing of the secretory proteins in the ER was hitherto supported by circumstantial evidence, such as co-localization with the ER chaperones and foldases, high expression in the secretory cells (4.Hubbard M.J. McHugh N.J. Carne D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1945-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and induction by ER stress (3.Mkrtchian S. Fang C. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The data presented in the current study demonstrate for the first time that in the professional secretory cells, such as thyrocytes where the expression of ERp29 reaches its highest levels (5.Sargsyan E. Baryshev M. Backlund M. Sharipo A. Mkrtchian S. Gene. 2002; 285: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), ERp29 might be directly implicated in the process of maturation and secretion of the main export product of these cells, thyroid prohormone Tg.The TSH-induced elevation of the ER chaperones in the thyroid cells is well documented and considered to be a part of the coordinated cell response to the increased synthesis of Tg (19.Endo T. Shimura H. Saito T. Ikeda M. Ohmori M. Onaya T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20.Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4873-4879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the influx of nascent Tg molecules in the ER triggers the unfolded protein response machinery responsible for the transcriptional activation of the chaperone genes (14.Arvan P. Kim P.S. Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Muresan Z. Yoo S.E. Abu Hossain S. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have observed a similar TSH-dependent up-regulation of ERp29 along with BiP, GRP94, and PDI, which is also consistent with the previously reported induction of the ERp29 transcript synthesis (12.Kwon O.Y. Park S. Lee W. You K.H. Kim H. Shong M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Comparable accumulation of the unfolded proteins in the ER (ER stress) caused by the different agents inhibiting protein glycosylation or altering calcium homeostasis or redox environment was also found to stimulate ERp29 biosynthesis in other mammalian cells (3.Mkrtchian S. Fang C. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It may therefore be speculated that up-regulation of ERp29 by TSH is coupled with the coordinated induction of the ER chaperones and PDI to maintain or even accelerate the folding rate of Tg.Folding of Tg is accomplished in the large macromolecular complexes containing simultaneously a number of molecular chaperones that control the folding state of Tg by repetitive binding and dissociation until the formation of the transport-competent, stable Tg dimers (14.Arvan P. Kim P.S. Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Muresan Z. Yoo S.E. Abu Hossain S. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such transient interactions of molecular chaperones with Tg are usually weak (with the exception of BiP), and association with Tg is detected only if augmented by chemical cross-linking (16.Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4873-4879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stabilization of the noncovalent interactions by cross-linking was also essential for the detection of ERp29 in the Tg- and BiP-containing sucrose density fractions and in the Tg immunoprecipitates, suggesting the weak and transient nature of ERp29 associations. Transient binding of molecular chaperones to their substrates may be expanded if misfolded protein is not able to acquire the final three-dimensional structure. For instance, prolonged interaction of BiP and GRP94 with the mutant, transport-incompetent form of Tg was shown on the mouse model of congenital goiter (26.Kim P.S. Kwon O.Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).This principle was used to demonstrate physical interaction of the ER chaperones with their substrates using immobilized denatured proteins as a bait (15.Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reproduction of the same experimental conditions allowed us to “fish out” ERp29 along with BiP and PDI from the FRTL-5 cell lysate or purified lumenal fraction of the rat liver microsomes. At the same time, certain differences were noted in the ERp29 interaction with the substrate proteins as compared with BiP or PDI: 1) Unlike BiP, ERp29 could not dissociate from the Tg-Sepharose upon ATP elution, which indicates the absence of ATPase activity characteristic for many chaperones. A similar lack of any ATP effect was observed also in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments (see “Results”). 2) ERp29 appears to have narrower substrate specificity as compared with BiP and PDI. This was exemplified by the absence of binding to the denatured histone-Sepharose. 3) Despite the preferential association with the denatured Tg, appreciable amounts of ERp29 have been eluted also from the native ligand, which is in clear contrast to the BiP-like discrimination between properly folded and unfolded substrates and binding almost exclusively to the former. Taken together, these data indicate a unique mode of interaction of ERp29 with the substrate protein(s), which is more reminiscent of features of the chaperones with more narrow substrate specificity, such as GRP94 (27.Argon Y. Simen B.B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or even dedicated escort chaperones, such as low density lipoprotein receptor-associated protein (28.Willnow T.E. Nykjaer A. Herz J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The latter remains attached to the receptor even after the completion of its folding and further escorts it to the cell surface. Interestingly, the interaction of receptor-associated protein with Tg has been recently demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo (29.Marino M. Chiovato L. Lisi S. Pinchera A. McCluskey R.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar role of the dedicated chaperone was proposed also for the Drosophilaanalog of ERp29, Windbeutel (10.Konsolaki M. Schupbach T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30.Sen J. Goltz J.S. Konsolaki M. Schupbach T. Stein D. Development. 2000; 127: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although lumenal ER chaperones may leak from the ER, they are usually recycled back by the ERD2 receptor recognizing their KDEL (and similar) C-terminal sequence (31.Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Despite the existence of such retrieval mechanism, many lumenal proteins, such as GRP94, PDI, calreticulin, BiP, and PDI, have been found in the cell exterior (22.Bruneau N. Lombardo D. Levy E. Bendayan M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 49: 329-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23.Xiao G. Chung T.F. Pyun H.Y. Fine R.E. Johnson R.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24.Wiest D.L. Bhandoola A. Punt J. Kreibich G. McKean D. Singer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25.Mezghrani A. Courageot J. Mani J.C. Pugniere M. Bastiani P. Miquelis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1920-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and several reports have proposed possible functional significance of such localization (25.Mezghrani A. Courageot J. Mani J.C. Pugniere M. Bastiani P. Miquelis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1920-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32.Johnson S. Michalak M. Opas M. Eggleton P. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The instances of the unusual localization of PDI are of particular interest for this study. ERp29 is a structural homolog of PDI despite the absence of the active site motif, and because PDI may function also as a general chaperone, it was proposed that these two proteins might have some overlapping functions (9.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure. 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, extracellular function of PDI may differ from the ERp29 role, because PDI was found on the surface of FRTL-5 cells and proposed to react with Tg under acidic conditions (25.Mezghrani A. Courageot J. Mani J.C. Pugniere M. Bastiani P. Miquelis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1920-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas our studies in living cells failed to reveal any cell surface expression of ERp29 (results not shown).Possible reasons as to how KDEL proteins may escape recycling include saturation of KDEL receptor, defects in the retention system, and proteolytic removal of the C terminus bearing the retrieval signal (23.Xiao G. Chung T.F. Pyun H.Y. Fine R.E. Johnson R.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 72: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,32.Johnson S. Michalak M. Opas M. Eggleton P. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that overexpression of PDI does not result in the increased secretion of other KDEL proteins (33.Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Raney P. Haugejorden S. Green M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22029-22034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, substantial amounts of ERp29 and PDI were secreted even from the quiescent cells (Fig. 6). Consequently, the saturation of recycling mechanisms is not likely to be responsible for the ERp29 export. Electrophoretic migration of the secreted ERp29 was identical to the migration of the intracellular species, suggesting similar molecular masses. Extracellular ERp29 was also recognized by ERp29 antibodies, which were raised against a peptide from the C-terminal fragment of ERp29 (3.Mkrtchian S. Fang C. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (results not shown). These data speak in favor of the intact C terminus of ERp29, available for ERD2 receptor. At the same time, BFA-regulated export of ERp29 and co-localization of Tg and ERp29 in the putative transport structures indicate that ERp29 may proceed via the secretory pathway in a manner typical for secretory proteins. It was suggested that in certain cases secretion of KDEL proteins could be triggered by shielding their C-terminal recognition sequence by the substrate secretory proteins (24.Wiest D.L. Bhandoola A. Punt J. Kreibich G. McKean D. Singer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Based on the evidence presented in this study one can speculate that ERp29 export could occur because of such association with Tg. Such “co-secretion” is characteristic for so called escort chaperones (34.Herrmann J.M. Malkus P. Schekman R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or molecular escorts (35.Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such as receptor-associated protein. Interestingly, the ERp29 analog inDrosophila, Windbeutel, was identified as such dedicated escort chaperone, shown to facilitate the transport of its substrate, Pipe, a putative oligosaccharide-modifying enzyme essential for embryonic development, to the Golgi (30.Sen J. Goltz J.S. Konsolaki M. Schupbach T. Stein D. Development. 2000; 127: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).However, despite the demonstrated co-localization of ERp29 and Tg in the cell exterior (Fig. 6 A), we failed to detect ERp29/Tg association in the FRTL-5 cell medium utilizing immunoprecipitation approach (results not shown). Similarly, neither BiP nor GRP94 were found in the Tg or ERp29 immunocomplexes. It is worth noting that a similar absence of co-immunoprecipitating Tg, PDI, and BiP has been shown previously (25.Mezghrani A. Courageot J. Mani J.C. Pugniere M. Bastiani P. Miquelis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1920-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because the fate of Tg exported from the cultivated thyrocytes is quite different from the situation in the thyroid gland where secreted Tg is stored in the follicular lumen in form of compact, cross-linked aggregates (36.Herzog V. Berndorfer U. Saber Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), one cannot exclude the existence of the extracellular ERp29/Tg complexes in vivo.Evidence provided in this work including co-immunoprecipitation studies, sucrose density fractionation, immunofluorescent co-localization of ERp29 and Tg, and, finally, affinity isolation of ERp29 on the denatured protein matrix unambiguously point to the specific association(s) of ERp29 within the multicomponent Tg folding complex in the ER. Although it is tempting to speculate that ERp29 directly interacts with Tg in a chaperone-like manner, one cannot rule out its primary association with the other member(s) of the complex. We have shown, for instance, that BiP may be co-immunoprecipitated with ERp29 from the rat hepatoma cells (3.Mkrtchian S. Fang C. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, identification of two potential unfolded protein-binding sites in our recent study (9.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure. 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) may speak in favor of the direct ERp29/Tg interactions. Given the widespread pattern of ERp29 expression, similar interactions are anticipated also with the other secretory proteins, especially in the secretory cells with high levels of ERp29. Proper folding, post-translational modifications, and oligomerization of the secretory proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPDIprotein disulfide isomeraseTgthyroglobulinTSHthyroid-stimulating hormoneBFAbrefeldin ADSPdithiobis(succinimidyl) propionate6Hsix-hormonePBSphosphate-buffered salineTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumPDIprotein disulfide isomeraseTgthyroglobulinTSHthyroid-stimulating hormoneBFAbrefeldin ADSPdithiobis(succinimidyl) propionate6Hsix-hormonePBSphosphate-buffered salineTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate are essential prerequisites for their recruitment into the transport vesicles heading toward the cell exterior (1.Helenius A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Quality control of potential cargo proteins is accomplished by the molecular chaperones that monitor fidelity of the protein folding and prevent premature export of incorrectly folded or incompletely assembled secretory proteins from the ER (2.Stevens F.J. Argon Y. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence, such as inducibility in certain cell types under the ER stress conditions (3.Mkrtchian S. Fang C. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), high expression in the secretory tissues (4.Hubbard M.J. McHugh N.J. Carne D.L. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1998; 251: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggests that a recently discovered, ubiquitously expressed endoplasmic reticulum lumenal protein, ERp29, may complement this group of ER chaperones. endoplasmic reticulum protein disulfide isomerase thyroglobulin thyroid-stimulating hormone brefeldin A dithiobis(succinimidyl) propionate six-hormone phosphate-buffered saline tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate endoplasmic reticulum protein disulfide isomerase thyroglobulin thyroid-stimulating hormone brefeldin A dithiobis(succinimidyl) propionate six-hormone phosphate-buffered saline tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate ERp29 cDNA was originally cloned from the rat liver (3.Mkrtchian S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the ERp29 gene was shown to be highly conserved in all studied mammalian species (3.Mkrtchian S. Fang C. Hellman U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4.Hubbard M.J. McHugh N.J. Carne D.L. Eur. J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), are 90% identical on the amino acid sequence level (9.Liepinsh E. Baryshev M. Sharipo A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Otting G. Mkrtchian S. Structure. 2001; 9: 457-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ERp29 consists of two domains of which the N-terminal domain of ERp29 resembles the thioredoxin module of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), although without the active site double cysteines, indicating the lack of PDI-like redox function (9.Liepinsh E.

https://openalex.org/W1976031866,"TFF-peptides (formerly P-domain peptides, trefoil factors) are typical secretory products of many mucous epithelia and are aberrantly secreted during chronic inflammatory diseases. They are known to enhance the migration of intestinal, corneal, and bronchial epithelial cells. Using the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B as a model, it is shown here for the first time that TFF-peptides are capable of modulating the inflammatory response in vitro by regulating tumor necrosis factor-α-induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. In contrast, TFF2 itself does not change IL-6 and IL-8 secretion but triggers sustained activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) as well as phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). A complex differential regulation of tumor necrosis factor-α-induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion by TFF2 is observed that involves signaling via protein kinase C and ERK1/2. Furthermore, the motogenic effect of TFF2 on BEAS-2B cells is analyzed using a modified Boyden chamber assay. This migratory effect is shown to be dependent not only on protein kinase C and ERK1/2 but also on the activation of the Src family of tyrosine kinases.

Taken together, the data presented indicate an important physiological role of TFF-peptides during inflammatory conditions of mucous epithelia.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) is typically secreted from various mucous epithelia and represents (together with mucins) a major constituent of the mucus. TFF1 and TFF3 form disulfide-linked homo- and hetero-dimers, and each TFF-peptide shows a characteristic distribution within the human body (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hoffmann W. Jagla W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 213: 147-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and 2Hoffmann W. Jagla W. Wiede A. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 319-334PubMed Google Scholar). For example, TFF3 is the predominant TFF-peptide of the human respiratory tract, where it is released mainly from submucosal glands (5Wiede A. Jagla W. Welte T. Köhnlein T. Busk H. Hoffmann W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: 1330-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, TFF2 is released mainly in the human stomach by mucous neck cells and antral glands (6Hanby A.M. Poulsom R. Singh S. Elia R.E.R.E.G. Jeffery R.E. Wright N. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1110-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). All TFF-peptides are known for their protective or healing effects in vivo, particularly for the gastrointestinal mucosa. They are aberrantly secreted during various chronic inflammatory diseases (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hoffmann W. Jagla W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 213: 147-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 2Hoffmann W. Jagla W. Wiede A. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 319-334PubMed Google Scholar, and 7Wright N.A. Phil. Trans. R. Soc.

First, they have been reported to interact directly with certain mucins of the von Willebrand factor type to stabilize the extracellular mucus layer (8Tomasetto C. Masson R. Linares K.-L. Wendling C. Lefebvre O. Chenard M.-P. Rio M.-C. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 70-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Second, all three TFF-peptides enhance cell migration processes (motogenic activity) during in vitro wound healing assays. This was shown for a number of gastrointestinal cell lines, for corneal epithelial cells (for a compilation, see Ref. 1Hoffmann W. Jagla W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 213: 147-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and recently also for bronchial epithelial cells including the cell line BEAS-2B (9Oertel M. Graness A. Thim L. Bühling F. Kalbacher H. Hoffmann W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Third, antiapoptotic effects on different cell lines were reported for TFF2 and TFF3 (10Lalani E.N. Williams R. Jayaram Y. Gilbert C. Chaudhary K.S. Sku L.-S. Koumarianou A. Playford R. Stamp G.W.H. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 537-546PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chen Y.-H., Lu, Y., De Plaen I.G. Wang L.-Y. Tan X.-D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 2000; 97: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Fourth, TFF-peptides induce cell scattering (13Williams R. Stamp G.W.H. Gilbert C. Pignatelli M. Lalani E.-N. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar, 14Emami S., Le Floch N. Bruyneel L. Thim L. May F. Westley B. Rio M.-C. Mareel M. Gespach C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is still a question of debate concerning how TFF-peptides exert their intracellular molecular functions, and a putative TFF2 receptor was characterized only recently (15Thim L. Mortz E. Regul. Pept. 2000; 90: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The complex pattern of signaling cascades triggered by TFF-peptides is in the process of being investigated in detail. TFF3, for example, has been shown to increase phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in intestinal epithelial cells (16Boxberger H.-J. Behrens A. Balzer D. Hoffmann W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 56Google Scholar,17Taupin D. Wu D.C. Jeon W.K. Devaney K. Wang T.C. Podolsky D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: R31-R38Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which parallels the motogenic effect of TFF3 (18Kinoshita T. Taupin D.R. Itoh H. Podolsky D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4680-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This is in line with the fact that ERK phosphorylation enhances cell migration processes via phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase (19Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.K. Lanerolle P.de Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the antiapoptotic effect of TFF3 is reported to be mediated by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and the serine/threonine kinase Akt (12Taupin D.R. Kinoshita K. Podolsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 18Kinoshita T. Taupin D.R. Itoh H. Podolsky D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4680-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), leading to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (11Chen Y.-H., Lu, Y., De Plaen I.G. Wang L.-Y. Tan X.-D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The latter is one of the known downstream targets in antiapoptotic signaling of the PI3K/Akt pathway via phosphorylation of IκB kinase and IκB (20Romashkova K.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cell scattering effect of TFF-peptides is dependent on several signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt, phospholipase C/protein kinase C (PKC), and Src/RhoA (14Emami S., Le Floch N. Bruyneel L. Thim L. May F. Westley B. Rio M.-C. Mareel M. Gespach C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to test whether TFF-peptides might be capable of enhancing the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the chemokine IL-8, whose expression is also regulated via NF-κB (21Liberman T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Expression of these cytokines is a typical characteristic of severe pulmonary or gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, or inflammatory bowel disease (23Montón C. Torres A. Monaldi Arch. Chest Dis. 1998; 53: 56-63PubMed Google Scholar, 24Xing Z. Jordana M. Gauldie K. Wang J. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 185-201PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bousquet K. Jeffery P.K.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4757-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) are capable of modulating the TNF-α-induced secretion of IL-6 and IL-8. The majority of experiments presented here were performed with TFF2, making the results fully compatible with all the cell migration data on BEAS-2B cells published recently (9Oertel M. Graness A. Thim L. Bühling F. Kalbacher H. Hoffmann W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The BEAS-2B cell line is from normal human bronchial epithelial cells immortalized using an SV40/adenovirus-12 hybrid virus (27Reddel R.R., Ke, Y. Gerwin B.I. McMenamin M.G. Lechner J.F. Su R.T. Brash D.E. Park K.-B. Rhim J.S. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1904-1909PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 (Fisher), 1% 100× nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 5% AC2 (Cell Concept, Umkirch, Germany) as described previously (9Oertel M. Graness A. Thim L. Bühling F. Kalbacher H. Hoffmann W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The cells were starved for 18–24 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 without any supplements before testing. No antibiotics were used. Polyclonal antibodies against p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1 and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specifically recognizing activated MAPK ERK1/2 (phospho-T202/Y204), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK; phospho-T183/Y185), and p38 MAPK (phospho-T180/Y182) were from Cell Signaling TechnologyInc. (Beverly, MA). Human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF;Mr, 6222), bovine serum albumin, collagen type I, myelin basic protein, sodium orthovanadate, dithiothreitol, Triton X-100, protein A-Sepharose, Hepes, Tween 20, and diagnostic film (Biomax, Eastman Kodak Co.) were from Sigma. PD98059, UO126, BAY11-7082, SB203580, bisindolylmaleimide I HCl (BIS), Ro-31-8220, adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic phosphorothiolate-Rp (Rp-cAMPS), genistein, and PP2 were from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Diagnostic GmbH. ELISA kits for IL-6 and IL-8 were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). TNF-α was from Tebu (Frankfurt, Germany). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system was from Amersham Biosciences. Recombinant glycosylated human TFF2 (average Mr, 14,465) and recombinant human TFF3/dimer (Mr, 13,147) were produced as described previously (32Thim L. Norris K. Norris F. Nielsen P.F. Bjorn S.E. Christensen M. Petersen J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Thim L. Wöldike H.F. Nielsen P.F. Christensen M. Lynch-Devaney K. Podolsky D.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4757-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK1/2 was determined according to Graness et al. (35Graness A. Adomeit A. Heinze R. Wetzker R. Liebmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32016-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were centrifuged, and proteins from clarified supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-rabbit ERK1 polyclonal antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was recovered with protein A-Sepharose. Bound proteins were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 2 mm sodium vanadate, once with 0.5 m LiCl in 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), and once with kinase buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate). Reactions were performed in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm unlabeled ATP, 3.3 μm dithiothreitol, and 1.5 mg of myelin basic protein for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of SDS-PAGE buffer. Samples were boiled, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated myelin basic protein was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. Immunoblotting of proteins was performed as described previously (36Graness A. Adomeit A. Ludwig B. Müller W.-D. Kaufmann R. Liebmann C. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 80–90% confluency, starved for 18 h, and stimulated with TFF2 or EGF and then rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined using Pierce Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For immunoblots, 15–25 μg of protein were loaded per lane and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% non-fat dry milk for 1 h, blots were incubated with the appropriate antibodies according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The ECL detection system was used to visualize the proteins of interest. BEAS-2B cells were grown in 24-well plates for 24 h (1.8 × 105cells/well) and then starved for 24 h. Twenty-four h after treatment with TNF-α/±TFF2 or TNF-α/±TFF3, the cell-free supernatants were collected and analyzed for secreted IL-6 or IL-8 protein by ELISA (commercially available from R&D Systems Inc.). Experiments with different inhibitors were performed by pretreatment of cells for 1 h prior to stimulation. The corresponding inhibitor was also present during stimulation with TNF-α/±TFF2. Cell migration assays were as described previously in detail (9Oertel M. Graness A. Thim L. Bühling F. Kalbacher H. Hoffmann W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.K. Lanerolle P.de Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Experiments with different inhibitors were performed by preincubation of the cells for 30 min prior to trypsin treatment. The corresponding inhibitor at the given concentration was also present in the lower chamber during cell migration. Each determination represents the average of three individual wells. Error bars in the figures show the standard error of the mean (S.E.). Significance by Student's t test is indicated in the figures by: one asterisk, p ≤ 0.05; two asterisks, p ≤ 0.01; and three asterisks, p ≤ 0.001. IL-6 and IL-8 secretion by BEAS-2B cells was measured either directly after treatment with TFF2 or in combination with TNF-α, which is a known stimulus for secretion of these proinflammatory cytokines. The typical TNF-α concentration for such experiments is 10 ng/ml (30Quay K.L. Reed W. Samet K. Devlin R.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the result of an experimental series in which both IL-6 and IL-8 secretion was monitored at a constant TFF2 concentration and varying TNF-α concentrations. The constant TFF2 concentration was 800 nm, which has been determined as being optimal for enhancing the migration of BEAS-2B cells after in vitro wounding (9Oertel M. Graness A. Thim L. Bühling F. Kalbacher H. Hoffmann W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A significant augmentation of the TNF-α-induced secretion of IL-6 by TFF2 was observed at all three TNF-α concentrations tested (i.e.2.5, 10, or 100 ng/ml). In contrast, IL-8 secretion was augmented significantly at 10 ng/ml TNF-α only. Thus, a TNF-α concentration of 10 ng/ml was defined as the standard for all subsequent augmentation studies. Remarkably, TFF2 alone did not enhance IL-6 or IL-8 secretion. Furthermore, the influence of varying TFF2 concentrations was determined at the optimal TNF-α concentration of 10 ng/ml (Fig. 1 B). There is a clear dose-dependent effect on both IL-6 and IL-8 secretion. Increasing TFF2 concentrations increase interleukin secretion, probably reaching saturation at 800 nm TFF2. Thus, augmentation of both IL-6 and IL-8 secretion was routinely monitored at 10 ng/ml TNF-α and 800 nm TFF2 in all subsequent studies. Under these conditions, four different experimental series revealed a 1.6–2.8-fold augmentation of IL-6 secretion and a 1.4–2.4-fold enhancement of IL-8 secretion. TFF3 is the major TFF-peptide of the human respiratory tract (5Wiede A. Jagla W. Welte T. Köhnlein T. Busk H. Hoffmann W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: 1330-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to be as motogenic for BEAS-2B cells as TFF2 (9Oertel M. Graness A. Thim L. Bühling F. Kalbacher H. Hoffmann W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, augmentation of TNF-α-induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion by TFF3/dimer was tested in a systematic study outlined in Fig. 2. 800 nm TFF3/dimer caused an extremely high significant enhancement (p ≤ 0.001) of IL-6 and IL-8 secretion, whereas lower TFF3 concentrations showed rather weak effects. A number of specific inhibitors were tested to investigate the signaling cascades triggered by TFF2 and TNF-α. Fig. 3 represents the results obtained with the PKC inhibitor BIS, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor Rp-cAMPS, the ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059, the inhibitor BAY11-7082 preventing degradation of IκB, and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580. Secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 was completely blocked by BAY11-7082 and significantly inhibited by SB203580. In contrast, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor had little effect. An interesting result was obtained with BIS and PD98059, which partially inhibited IL-8 secretion whereas the secretion of IL-6 was enhanced. Each of these results has been confirmed by at least two independent experimental series. Treatment of BEAS-2B cells with TFF2 resulted in the phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK1/2 and the JNK (Fig. 4). A time course revealed that full activation of ERK1/2 is reached after about 10 min and decreases only gradually even after 40 min (Fig. 5). In contrast, the activation of ERK1/2 by EGF declines somewhat more rapidly, reaching a maximum after about 7 min. Various control treatments of the cells with phosphate-buffered saline did not result in ERK1/2 activation at any time (data not illustrated).Figure 5Time course of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells triggered by TFF2 or EGF. BEAS-2B cells were serum-starved for 18 h prior to stimulation. Then the cells were incubated for the indicated times with either 800 nm TFF2 (upper panel) or 100 ng/ml EGF (i.e. 16 nm; lower panel). ERK1/2 activity was determined using the myelin basic protein phosphorylation assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Error bars show the ± S.E. of five separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Motogenic effects of TFF2 were tested in a haptotaxis assay using modified Boyden chambers as described previously (9Oertel M. Graness A. Thim L. Bühling F. Kalbacher H. Hoffmann W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Standardized concentration of TFF-peptides (in the lower chamber) in this assay is 1.6 μm because lower concentrations did not result in significant motogenic activity. As shown in Fig. 6 A, TFF2 not only enhanced migration of BEAS-2B cells but also promoted TNF-α-induced migration of these cells (additive effect). The TNF-α concentration tested was the same as that determined as being optimal for IL-6 and IL-8 secretion (i.e. 10 ng/ml). This result has been confirmed by at least two independent experimental series (1.4-fold augmentation of cell migration). Furthermore, the influence of various TFF2 concentrations was determined at a constant TNF-α level of 10 ng/ml (Fig. 6 B). Only the highest dose tested (1.6 μm TFF2) showed a statistically significant result. A number of specific inhibitors were tested to investigate the signaling cascades responsible for cell migration processes triggered by TFF2. Each of these results has been confirmed by at least two independent experimental series. Fig. 7represents the results obtained with the ERK kinase inhibitors PD98059 and UO126, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580, the PKC inhibitors BIS and Ro-31-8220, the inhibitor BAY11-7082, which prevents degradation of IκB, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor Rp-cAMPS, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, and the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2. The motogenic effect of TFF2 could be significantly inhibited only by the two ERK kinase inhibitors tested, the two PKC inhibitors, or the two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Fig. 7). All other inhibitors displayed immeasurable effects. However, these inhibitors (i.e. SB203580, BAY11-7082 and Rp-cAMPS) were quite active in the experiments shown in Fig. 3. TNF-α, a pleiotropic cytokine, regulates many aspects of the host defense mechanisms against pathogenetic microorganisms (37Vasalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, e.g. asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. The activation of gene expression is a major effect of TNF-α. In particular, TNF-α induces expression of chemokines such as IL-8, which is mainly implicated in the infiltration of neutrophils across the vascular wall. TNF-α also strongly induces acute phase proteins as well as IL-6, which triggers the release of the complement proteins. TNF-α interacts with and induces trimerization of two cell surface receptors, TNFR1/CD120a (p55) and TNFR2/CD120b (p75), triggering a complex set of signaling cascades (38Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 39Leong K.G. Karsan A. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 1303-1325PubMed Google Scholar). The principal transcription factors activated are NF-κB and activator protein-1 (AP-1).

In contrast, it produced a poorly reversible block (IC50 = ∼50 nm) of rat neuronal α7 receptors, clearly showing diverse functional profiles for the two nicotinic receptor subsets. Interestingly, candoxin lacks the helix-like segment cyclized by the fifth disulfide bridge at the tip of the middle loop of long chain neurotoxins, reported to be critical for binding to α7 receptors. However, its solution NMR structure showed the presence of some functionally invariant residues involved in the interaction of both short and long chain neurotoxins to muscle (αβγδ) and long chain neurotoxins to α7 receptors. Candoxin is therefore a novel toxin that shares a common scaffold with long chain α-neurotoxins but possibly utilizes additional functional determinants that assist in recognizing neuronal α7 receptors.

The additional disulfide bridge in long chain α-neurotoxins, as well in the neuronal κ-bungarotoxin (B. multicinctus) is located in the middle loop (loop II) (3Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L.

Consequently, short chain α-neurotoxins that lack this fifth disulfide bridge bind to neuronal nAChRs with about 3 orders of magnitude lower affinity than long chain neurotoxins (17Servent D.

They are typically characterized by a lower order of toxicity (LD50 varying from ∼5 to 80 mg/kg) as opposed to prototype α-neurotoxins (LD50 varying from ∼ 0.04 to 0.3 mg/kg) (29Mebs D. Claus I. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 425-447Google Scholar). Apart from toxicity studies, weak toxins have been poorly investigated in terms of their function or molecular targets. The three-fingered fold is also adopted by proteins from nonvenom sources like the Ly-6 family of cell surface accessory proteins expressed on immune system cells (30Gumley T.P. McKenzie I.F.C.

This raises the possibility that snake toxins, particularly the weak toxins that have an additional disulfide bond in loop I as do Lynx 1 and the Ly-6 family of proteins (30Gumley T.P.

This is significantly less potent than the typical long chain α-neurotoxins that inhibit both α7 and muscle (αβγδ) nAChRs in nanomolar concentrations (17Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y.

We now report the isolation, purification, and pharmacological and electrophysiological characterization, as well as some structural data of a novel toxin, candoxin, from the venom of the Malayan krait Bungarus candidus. Nanomolar concentrations of candoxin produced a readily reversible block of muscle (αβγδ) nAChRs, whereas it produced a poorly reversible block of neuronal α7 receptors, clearly showing diverse functional properties toward the two subsets of nicotinic receptors. In light of the scientific and clinical significance of neuronal nAChRs (34Cordero-Erausquin M. Marubio L.M. Klink R. Changeux J.-P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 211-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), candoxin could play an important role as a biological marker of α7 receptors. Lyophilized B. candidus venom was obtained from Venom Supplies (Tanunda, Australia). Prepacked chromatography columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All drugs and chemicals were purchased from Sigma with the exception of the following, which were obtained from the sources indicated: reagents for N-terminal sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), acetonitrile (Fisher), and trifluoroacetic acid (Fluka Chemika-Biochemika, Buchs, Switzerland). HPLC grade water was obtained by using a Milli-Q purification system (Millipore). α-Cobratoxin, α-bungarotoxin, and erabutoxin-b were from Latoxan (Valence, France). B. candidus venom was fractionated based on the molecular weight of the components on a Superdex 30 fast performance liquid chromatography column (1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with Tris-hydrochloride buffer (50 mm; pH 7.5). The fraction containing candoxin was further purified on a reverse-phase Jupiter C18 (0.21 × 25 cm) column using a Vision Biocad Work station (Bio-Rad). The column was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (20–45% over 80 min) of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer B). The HPLC peak containing candoxin was rechromatographed by reverse-phase HPLC using a shallower gradient of buffer B (28–36% over 50 min). Elution of proteins was monitored at 280 and 215 nm. Candoxin was subjected to electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole instrument equipped with an ion spray interface. The ion spray and orifice voltages were set to 4600 and 30 V, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a curtain gas with a flow rate of 0.6 liter/min, and compressed air was used as a nebulizer gas. The sample was infused by flow injection at a flow rate of 50 μl/min using Shimadzu 10 AD pumps as the solvent delivery system. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager DE-STR Biospectrometry work station (Applied Biosystems). The matrix used was saturated with (10 mg/ml) sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) in 1:1 acetonitrile:water containing 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid. Candoxin (5 pmol in 1 μl) was spotted onto a stainless steel sample plate with 1 μl of matrix solution and dried off. The accelerating voltage was set at 25,000 V, and the grid and guide wire voltages were set at 93.0% and 0.3%, respectively. Molecular ions were generated using a nitrogen laser (wavelength 337 nm) at an intensity of 1800–2200. Extraction of ions was delayed by 800 ns. The spectrum was calibrated using external standards. Capillary electrophoresis was performed on a BioFocus3000 system (Bio-Rad). Candoxin (50 μg) was injected to a 25 μm × 17 cm coated capillary using a pressure mode (5 p.s.i./s) and run in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) under 18.00 kV from positive to negative at 20 °C for 7 min. Migration was monitored at 200 nm. Purified candoxin (50 μg) or a 1:1 mixture of candoxin (50 μg) and the major curaremimetic neurotoxin (α-bungarotoxin-like protein; molecular weight, 7986.4) 2S.

The column was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (10–65% over 60 min) of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer B). Candoxin was resuspended in 100 μl of denaturant buffer (6.0 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.13 mTris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 0.07 mβ-mercaptoethanol. The solution was heated at 37 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, 1.5-fold molar excess (over sulfhydryl groups) of 4-vinylpyridine was added and incubated at room temperature. After 2 h, the sample was desalted by reverse-phase HPLC. N-terminal sequencing of the native and pyridylethylated protein was done by automated Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 494 pulsed liquid phase protein sequencer (Procise) with an on-line 785A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. The pair of chick biventer cervicis muscles (CBCM) were isolated from 7–10-day-old chicks (35Ginsborg B.L. Warriner J.N. Br. J.

The solution was maintained at 34 °C and aerated with 5% carbon dioxide in oxygen. Motor responses of the muscle were evoked by stimulating the motor nerve supramaximally by electrical field stimulation (7–10 V, 0.1 ms, 0.2 Hz) using a Grass stimulator and recorded in a Mac Lab system 8TM (AD Instruments, Sydney, NSW Australia) via a force displacement transducer (model FT03). Direct muscle stimulation was achieved by electrical field stimulation (20–30 V, 1 ms, 0.2 Hz) in the presence of d-tubocurarine (10 μm) to block neuromuscular transmission. Submaximal contractures to exogenously applied ACh (300 μm for 30 s), carbachol (8 μm for 90 s), and potassium chloride (30 mm for 60 s) were obtained in the absence of electrical field stimulation prior to the addition of the candoxin (0.1–100 μg/ml; 0.0136–13.6 μm) and at the end of the experiment. The neuromuscular blockade produced by candoxin was compared with that produced by 0.005–20 μg/ml of erabutoxin-b (36Sato S. Tamiya N. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (0.733–2.9 μm), α-bungarotoxin (37Kosen P.A. Finer-Moore J. McCarthy M.P. Basus V.J.

Biochem. 1971; 21: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (0.626–2.55 μm). The neuromuscular block is expressed as a percentage of control twitch height after 15 min of exposure of the CBCM to the respective toxins. The recovery of the CBCM from complete neuromuscular blockade produced by candoxin or 90% blockade produced by erabutoxin-b, α-bungarotoxin, or α-cobratoxin, was assessed by washing the respective toxin by bath overflow with fresh Kreb's solution until maximal recovery. The effects of the anticholinesterase, neostigmine (0.1–3 μm) on the reversal of neuromuscular blockade were also studied. The amino acid sequence of candoxin was subjected to a similarity search using BLAST (39Altschul S.F. Thomas L.M. Alejandro A.S. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

The structures were annotated and visualized using WeblabViewerLite, version 3.2 (Molecular Simulations Inc.). Xenopus oocytes were isolated and prepared as described previously (44Bertrand D. Cooper E. Valera S. Rungger D. Ballivet M. Conn M. Methods in Neuroscience. 4. Academic Press, New York1991: 174-193Google Scholar). The oocytes were injected intranuclearly with expression vectors containing the various cDNAs (2 ng) and incubated for 2–3 days at 18 °C in Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 0.82 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2·4H2O, and 0.41 mm CaCl2·6H2O). The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. All of the subunits were injected in equal concentrations. To minimize contamination, the medium was supplemented with 20 μg/ml of kanamycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Electrophysiological recordings were performed with a two-electrode voltage clamp (GeneClamp amplifier; Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) as described previously (17Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Menez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 45Bertrand D. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 146: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The cells were held at −100 mV and continuously superfused with OR2 (oocyte ringer) medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH) with 2.5 mm Ca2+during the recording. The flow rate was ∼6 ml/min, and the volume of the chamber was less than 100 μl. To ensure equilibrium of the blockade, the oocytes were exposed to candoxin for 30 min in all of the experiments. To prevent adsorption of the toxin on the plastic, bovine serum albumin was added to the perfusion and candoxin media at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Concentration-response curves were adjusted using the empirical Hill equation. Y=1/(1+(x/IC50)^nH)Equation 1 where Y is the fraction of remaining current, IC50 is concentration of half-inhibition, nH is the apparent cooperativity, and x is antagonist concentration. For muscle (αβγδ) receptors, the inhibition curve was best fitted with a two-component Hill equation. When two Hill equations were employed (see Fig. 4 B), the sum of two identical equations was computed. Candoxin was purified to homogeneity by consecutive gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC.B. candidus venom was fractionated on a Superdex 30 gel filtration column, and the fractions constituting peak 4 (Fig. 1 A, indicated by horizontal bar) were found to produce neuromuscular blockade in the isolated CBCM. The proteins in peak 4 were further fractionated on a reverse-phase HPLC Jupiter C18 column as shown in Fig. 1 B. The protein peak identified was rechromatographed by reverse-phase HPLC using a shallower gradient (Fig. 1 C,arrow). The single protein peak thus obtained by rechromatography was named candoxin. To ensure the absence of contaminants, especially by other α-neurotoxin(s) present in the venom, the purified sample of candoxin was subjected to several sensitive assays and found to be homogenous by analytical reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 D), capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 1 E), ESI mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 F), and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 G). Moreover, the elution peaks of candoxin (molecular weight, 7334.6) and the α-bungarotoxin-like protein (molecular weight, 7984.4) were widely separated in the chromatogram obtained by analytical reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 D). Finally, during the process of amino acid sequencing by automated Edman degradation, there was no evidence for the presence of any peptide contaminants, even when up to 9 nmol of candoxin was loaded on the sequencer. Candoxin has a molecular mass of 7334.67 ± 0.35 as determined by ESI mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 F) and reconfirmed by MALDI-TOF (7334.69 ± 0.26) (Fig. 1 G). It constitutes about 1–2% of the crude venom. We were able to unequivocally identify all of the residues and determine the complete amino acid sequence of both native (blank cycles where cysteine residues are found) and pyridylethylated candoxin samples. Candoxin has 66 amino acid residues including 10 cysteine residues. The calculated mass of candoxin is 7344.4, and with the expected five disulfide bridges, the calculated mass coincides well with the estimated molecular masses of 7334.67 ± 0.35 (ESI mass spectrometry) and 7334.69 ± 0.26 (MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry). The amino acid sequence of candoxin (Fig. 2) is deposited in the SWISS-PROT protein data base (accession number P81783). The disulfide linkages, established by the observation of long range Hβ-Hβ nuclear Overhauser effects in the nuclear Overhauser effect spectrum in NMR studies, showed the presence of five disulfide bridges, of which those seen between Cys3 and Cys26, Cys19 and Cys43, Cys47 and Cys59, and Cys60 and Cys65 were homologous to the four conserved disulfide bridges found in other members of the three-finger toxin family (Fig. 2). 3V. R. Parvathy, K. V. R. Chary, R. M. Kini, and G. Govil, manuscript in preparation. 4The chemical shifts of individual protons obtained by NMR study of candoxin are available in the BioMagResBank data base under accession number 4391. The fifth disulfide bridge in candoxin is located at the tip of loop I (Cys6–Cys11) instead of in loop II as found in other α-neurotoxins (46Parvathy V.R Chary K.V.R. Kini R.M. Govil G. Curr. Sci. 2000; 79: 219-222Google Scholar). Candoxin shares ∼30–40% identity with short and long chain α-neurotoxins and κ-bungarotoxins, as well as other three-finger toxins (Fig. 2 A). The four conserved disulfide bridges contribute significantly (∼20%) to the similarity. Candoxin is identical but for one or two residues to two long neurotoxin homologues deduced from cDNA sequences from B. multicinctus. Other weak toxins, including WTX (24Utkin Y.N. Kukhtina V.V.

Toxicon. 1999; 37: 609-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), showed ∼40–45% identity with the exception of a neurotoxin homologue (EMBL accession number CAC50565) deduced from its cDNA sequence from a coral snake Micrurus corallinus(Elapidae) that showed significant (56%) identity. Interestingly, candoxin showed only 29% identity to bucandin, a three-finger toxin structurally related to weak toxins that was purified from the same venom (48Kuhn P. Deakon A.M. Comoso S.

Mice injected (intraperitoneally) with candoxin showed flaccid paralysis of the hind limbs (data not shown). Accordingly, we screened candoxin for biological activity on isolated nerve muscle preparations. Candoxin produced a rapid, concentration-dependent blockade of the twitch responses of the CBCM to indirect (nerve) stimulation as well as a complete block of the responses to exogenously applied nicotinic agonists, ACh and carbachol (data not shown). Neither the twitch responses elicited by direct muscle stimulation nor the responses to exogenously applied KCl (50 mm) were affected by candoxin (up to 200 μg/ml; 27.2 μm) (data not shown). The neuromuscular blockade was sustained for over 90 min without spontaneous reversal, following which the t"

Deleting the N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain to generate Vav3-(5-10) or deleting both the CH and the acidic domain to generate Vav3-(6-10) results in activating the transforming potential of Vav3. Expression of either the full-length Vav3 or its truncation mutants led to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and Stat3. We investigated the requirement of these signaling molecules for Vav3-induced focus formation and found that PI3K and its downstream signaling molecules, Akt and p70 S6 kinase, are required, albeit to varying degrees. Inhibition of PI3K had a more dramatic effect than inhibition of MAPK on Vav3-(6-10)-induced focus formation. Activated PI3K enhanced the focus-forming activity of Vav3-(6-10). Wild type FAK but not Y397F mutant FAK enhanced Vav3-(6-10)-induced focus formation. Dominant negative (dn) mutant of Stat3 resulted in a 60% inhibition of the focus-forming activity of Vav3-(6-10). Moreover, Rac1, RhoA, and to a lesser extent, Cdc42, are important for Vav3-(6-10)-induced focus formation. Constitutively activated (ca) Rac synergizes with Vav3-(6-10) in focus formation. This synergy requires signaling via Rho-associated kinase (ROK) and p21-activated kinase (PAK), downstream effectors of Rac. Consistently, a ca PAK mutant enhanced, whereas a dn PAK mutant inhibited the focus-forming ability of Vav3-(6-10). Despite having potent focus-forming ability, Vav3-(6-10) has very weak colony-forming ability. This colony-forming ability of Vav3-(6-10) can be enhanced dramatically by co-expressing an activated PI3K and to some extent by co-expressing an activated PAK mutant or c-Myc. Interestingly, inhibition of PI3K and MAPK had no effect on the ability of either wild type or Vav3-(6-10) to induce cytoskeletal changes including formation of lamellipodia and filopodia in NIH 3T3 cells. Over expression of Vav3 or Vav3-(6-10) resulted in an enhancement of cell motility. This enhancement was dependent on PI3K, Rac1, and Cdc42 but not on Rho. Overall, our results show that signaling pathways of PI3K, MAPK, and Rho family GTPases are differentially required for Vav3-induced focus formation, colony formation, morphological changes, and cell motility."

The biological effect of MAPK signaling in the nucleus is achieved by signal-responsive transcription factors. Here we have investigated MAPK signaling and activation of AP-1 transcription factors in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells undergoing cardiomyocyte differentiation. We show that aggregation and Me2SO treatment, which trigger the differentiation response, result in sustained activation of JNK1, p38, and ERK1/2 MAPKs and acquisition of AP-1 DNA binding activity. The induced AP-1 activity consists of c-Jun, JunD, and Fra-2 proteins and is accompanied with the increased expression of these proteins. JNK is involved in c-Jun phoshorylation, whereas ERK and p38 activities are essential for maximal c-Jun and Fra-2 expression, and AP-1 DNA binding activity. While the inhibition of ERK can partially prevent the formation of beating cardiomyocytes, the activity of p38 is absolutely required for the differentiation. Expression of dominant negative c-JunbZIP in P19 cells can also inhibit the differentiation response. Surprisingly, however, expression of dominant negative SEK or JNK causes an inhibition of P19 cell proliferation.

They are kinase cascades consisting of sequential phosphorylation and activation of MAPK kinase kinases (MAPKKK), which phosphorylate and thereby activate MAPK kinases (MAPKK), which in turn phosphorylate MAPKs (1Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). At present, three conserved MAPKs have been identified in detail: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and -2), the stress-activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK 1, 2, and 3), and p38 kinases (p38 α, β, and γ). Consistent with the name, the ERK signaling pathway is described as a general regulator of cell growth and differentiation in response to mitogenic stimuli, whereas JNKs and p38 kinases were originally identified as stress kinases mediating responses to inflammatory cytokines, radiation, redox, osmotic, and other forms of stress. However, recent reports have demonstrated that JNK and p38 kinases also play important regulatory roles in a number of cellular functions unrelated to stress responses. These include developmental processes in flies and mice, as well as proliferation, differentiation, and survival in several vertebrate cell types (2Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar,3Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The biological effects of MAPKs are mediated by downstream phosphorylation substrates, which in the nucleus are often transcription factors. c-Jun is an inducible transcription factor, which was identified as a basic mediator of the transcriptional response to JNK activation (4Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 5Leppä S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). It is a member of the AP-1 family of leucine zipper transcription factors, and forms DNA-binding homo- or heterodimers with other Jun (JunB and JunD) and Fos (c-Fos, Fra-1, Fra-2, and FosB) family members, and ATF-2 (4Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). JNK binds directly to c-Jun NH2 terminus and phosphorylates it on serines 63 and 73, and threonines 91 and/or 93 within its transactivation domain. Phosphorylation of these residues results in c-Jun stabilization, and increased DNA binding and transcriptional activities at the AP-1 recognition site, also called the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate responsive element (TRE) (4Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 5Leppä S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). JunB and JunD are also substrates for JNK, whereas ATF-2 is phosphorylated and activated by JNK and p38 (4Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 5Leppä S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 6Li B. Tournier C. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 420-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). c-Fos and Fra-1 and -2, in turn, are substrates for phosphorylations by the ERKs (7Gruda M.C. Kovary K. Metz R. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2537-2547PubMed Google Scholar, 8Okazaki K. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5048-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and in some cell types c-Jun is also regulated by ERK-mediated mechanisms (5Leppä S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Another mechanism required for AP-1 activation is transcriptional induction of certain AP-1 encoding genes, including c-junand c-fos. They are immediate-early genes, whose transcription is induced rapidly in response to external stimuli, such as growth factors or UV light (4Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The transcriptional response of c-jun promoter is predominantly mediated by two AP-1 like sites, which preferentially bind c-Jun and ATF-2 heterodimers (9van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. de Vries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. van der Eb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). An additional inducible element in the c-jun promoter binds members of the MEF family of transcription factors (10Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Han J. Li Y. Jiang Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 12Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of pre-existing and newly synthesized c-Jun proteins can further enhance their transcriptional activities, and support a strong autoregulatory loop for c-jun expression and induction of AP-1 target genes (13Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The function of AP-1 is also dependent on the dimer composition present in the DNA binding complex. The different AP-1 homodimers exhibit similar DNA-binding specificities but may differ in their affinities and transactivation efficiencies. For example, JunB is a less potent activator of transcription than c-Jun, and in certain promoter contexts can even be inhibitory (14Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 15Schütte J. Vaillet J. Nau M. Segal S. Fedorko J. Minna J.

Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Finally, the cross-dimerization of Jun, Fos, and ATF proteins can further expand the combinatorial diversity of the AP-1 transcription factors. Dimerization of c-Jun with ATF-2 alters the DNA binding specificity of c-Jun allowing targeting to cyclic AMP responsive element-related sequences, while c-Jun and c-Fos heterodimers favor the consensus TRE present in the collagenase promoter (18Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 19van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P.

Due to the complexity of regulatory inputs converging on AP-1 proteins, the biological responses that these factors mediate are very broad. The role of c-Jun as a positive regulator of cell proliferation is well documented (21Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 22Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, c-Jun is also an important mediator of both pro- and antiapoptotic signals (22Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 23Leppä S.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4369-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The basis for these seemingly disparate roles for c-Jun are unclear, but are likely to reflect cell type and context dependent differences. In addition, c-Jun signaling can positively or negatively regulate different types of cellular differentiation. Studies in cell culture have shown that c-Jun can promote the differentiation of many different cell lineages including neuronal, epithelial, and myeloid cells (23Leppä S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 26de Groot R.P. Kruyt F.A. van der Saag P.T. Kruijer W.

In PC12 cells, for example, c-Jun activation contributes to neuronal differentiation in a phoshorylation-dependent manner (23Leppä S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In the developing skin, in turn, c-Jun and JunB activities are required for the fibroblast-mediated paracrine control of KGF and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor expression, which stimulate growth and differentiation of keratinocytes (29Szabowski A.

On the contrary, the differentiation of skeletal muscle cells is negatively regulated by certain AP-1 proteins, including c-Jun and JunB (30Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J.

Although cardiomyocytes and skeletal myocytes are similar in many respects, their developmental pathways differ considerably. Cardiomyocytes originate from different progenitor cells, continue to proliferate during initial steps of differentiation, and do not require myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, including MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4, for the differentiation response. Whereas the function of distinct MAPKs and AP-1 proteins during skeletal muscle differentiation is well described, their role in early cardiogenesis has not yet been assessed. Interestingly, however, it was found recently that c-jun deficiency causes impaired heart outflow track formation, which leads to a developmental defect similar to persistent truncus arteriosus (24Eferl R.

Moreover, during cardiac hypertrophy, in which terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes re-enter a growth program involving increased myocyte mass and altered gene expression, AP-1 activation precedes growth and up-regulation of cardiac-specific gene expression (37Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 38MacLellan W.R. Schneider M.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined the activation of MAPKs and AP-1 in cardiomyocyte differentiation using P19 embryonal carcinoma cell line as a model system. P19 cells are malignant stem cells of teratocarcinoma and resemble the pluripotent stem cells from the inner mass of early mouse pre-implantation embryos (39McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The P19 cell line provides a useful model to study molecular and cellular changes during embryonic differentiation, since the cells can differentiate into cell types from different germinal layers. In response to aggregation and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), P19 cells differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells. Cardiac cells appear on day 6 after induction as rhythmically contracting cardiomyocytes that are embryonic in nature. Simultaneously, myogenic markers, such as myosin heavy chain, are induced. We report that ERK, JNK, p38, and their common substrate AP-1 are activated during cardiomyocyte differentiation of P19 cells. Additionally, inhibition of ERK, p38, and AP-1 activities prevents the differentiation response, whereas inhibition of JNKK and JNK leads to proliferation defect. The results suggest that coordinated activation of ERK, JNK, p38, and AP-1 is required to direct proliferation and cardiomyocyte differentiation in P19 cells. P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 mm pyruvate, 5 × 10−5β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Differentiation was initiated by growing 105 cells/ml in bacterial grade plastic dishes in the presence of 1% Me2SO (Sigma). On day 4 the cells were plated on tissue culture-grade dishes, and the differentiation of cells was continued in a medium without Me2SO. p38 and MEK kinase inhibitors SB203580 and PD98059 (Calbiochem) were added at the beginning of differentiation at 10 and 20 μm, respectively. Fresh medium containing inhibitors was changed every 24 h. The cells were harvested during the course of cardiomyocyte differentiation by centrifugation and quick freezing in liquid nitrogen. Cell pellets were homogenized in 2 volumes of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.42m NaCl, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μm leupeptin, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4. Amounts of total soluble protein were measured using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). To assay AP-1 DNA binding activity, cell extracts were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in a 20-μl reaction buffer containing 10 mmTris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 ng of [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the “consensus” AP-1 site 5′-GATCTATCTGAGTCAGCAG-3. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE and visualized by autoradiography. For antibody perturbation assays, dilutions of immunosera specific for c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, and ATF-2 (New England Biolabs and Santa Cruz) were preincubated with whole cell extracts for 15 min at room temperature prior to assays for DNA binding. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described above. Proteins (30–200 μg) were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed using polyclonal antibodies against AP-1 proteins (c-Jun, JunD, c-Fos, Fra-2; New England Biolabs and Santa Cruz), MAP kinases (phospho-p38, p38, phospho-ERK, ERK1/2, JNK1/2; New England Biolabs, Promega, and Santa Cruz), a mAb against Hsc70 (StressGene), and a mAb against myosin heavy chain (MF-20; a generous gift from M. Tiainen). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminisence (SuperSignal, Pierce). Cells were washed with PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4. JNK was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-JNK antibody (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h and washed several times with dilution buffer (25 mmHEPES-NAOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4). Kinase reactions were performed with 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at room temperature using GST-c-Jun protein (amino acids 5–105) as a substrate. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE and by autoradiography. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the single step method (40Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA was separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Filters were hybridized to [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNAs coding for mouse c-jun, junD, and ribosomal 18 S (Ambion). Hybridizations and washing conditions were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. P19 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. Duplicates of 60-mm diameter plates containing 105cells were transfected using the FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The following plasmids were used: the c-junpromoter reporters, pJC6luc, pJSXluc, and pJTXluc (12Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the internal control Renilla-luc (a gift from Carsten Weiss), and expression vectors for constitutively active MKK6 (41Alonso G. Ambrosino C. Jones M. Nebreda A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40641-40648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), MKK1 (42Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), and MKK4 (kindly provided by J. Woodgett). 24 h after transfection the cells were collected and Dual Luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The activities of the c-jun reporters were normalized to the activity of Renilla. For stable cell clones P19 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding a HA-tagged c-JunbZIP (23Leppä S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) together with a neomycin resistance gene (pCIneo, Promega) using the FuGENE reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 h, geneticin (G418 1 mg/ml, Sigma) was added to cells for selection of stable clones. An expression plasmid for Flag-tagged JNKAPFplasmid was transfected together with a puromycin resistance gene (pBabe Puro) and the selection of positive clones was carried out in the presence of 1–2 μg/ml Puromycin (Sigma). An expression plasmid for SEKAL carried a Zeocin resistance gene and the positive clones were selected with 250–300 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). The cell clones expressing c-JunbZIP, JNKAPF, and SEKAL were screened by immunostaining for HA, Flag epitope, or SEK1, respectively. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X in PBS. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin the cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody against an HA epitope. After several washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories) to detect the positive cell clones. After washes with PBS, the Hoechst dye 33258 (Sigma) was added into the last wash to visualize the nuclei. Cells were plated into 96-well plates at a density of 1500 cells/well in triplicates and cultured for the indicated periods of time. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet (0.5% in ethanol), and washed with distilled water. Stained cells were dissolved in 10% acetic acid, and the cell number assessed spectrometrically by absorbance at 560 nm. The crucial role of AP-1 transcription factors during the differentiation and development is well established (21Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 22Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). To investigate whether AP-1 is involved in the cardiomyocyte differentiation of P19 cells, we analyzed the activation of AP-1 during several stages of P19 cell differentiation. The cells were induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes by growing them in suspension as aggregates in the presence of 1% Me2SO. After 4 days, the cells were plated and 1% Me2SO was removed (Fig.1A). The differentiation response was confirmed by microscopic observation of rhythmically beating cardiomyocyte cells and the appearance of a muscle cell marker, a myosin heavy chain, after 6 days of induction (Fig.1A). The activation of AP-1 was analyzed by gel mobility shift assay using the 7-base pair consensus sequence TGAGTCA, a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate responsive element (TRE) as a binding site. We found that the AP-1 DNA binding activity was induced during the differentiation response (Fig. 1B, left panel). In the undifferentiated P19 cells the binding to TRE was not detectable. Activation was observed within 2 days after which it was sustained, as it gradually increased and reached maximal level within 8 days. To investigate the composition of the AP-1 complex during the cardiomyocyte differentiation of P19 cells we used antibody perturbation assays (Fig. 1B, middle andright panels). Antibody against c-Jun interfered with the AP-1 DNA complex formation, suggesting that c-Jun is a component of the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 1B, middle panel). In addition, antibodies against JunD and Fra-2 supershifted the complex, whereas antibodies against JunB, ATF-2, c-Fos, and Fra-1 did not have an effect on the AP-1 complex formation or the motility (Fig. 1B, middle and right panels). The results show that c-Jun, JunD, and Fra-2 proteins are activated and involved in the induced AP-1 DNA binding complex during the differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes. To examine whether the expression of the activated AP-1 proteins were affected during the differentiation response, the levels of c-Jun, JunD, Fra-2, and c-Fos were analyzed during distinct stages of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Consistent with the AP-1 DNA binding activity, the expression of both c-Jun and JunD proteins was increased (Fig. 2A). Undifferentiated P19 cells also expressed significant amounts of JunD, and low levels of c-Jun proteins, which were transiently down-regulated at day 2 and up-regulated again at day 4. Analogously with protein expression, c-jun and junD mRNA levels were induced, andjunD mRNAs showed a biphasic expression profile (Fig.2B). Since AP-1 DNA binding activity was not detectable in the undifferentiated cells, the significance of c-Jun and JunD up-regulation is unclear. However, the results indicate that c-Jun and JunD are inactive in undifferentiated P19 cells. They further demonstrate that increased expression of c-Jun and JunD is not sufficient for acquisition of AP-1 DNA binding activity. Fra-2 was not expressed in the control cells but the levels were prominently induced during the differentiation response (Fig. 2A). The induction was accompanied with a decreased motility of Fra-2, which has been shown to result from phosphorylation (7Gruda M.C. Kovary K. Metz R. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2537-2547PubMed Google Scholar, 43Murakami M. Ui M.H. Sonobe M. Kabuyama Y. Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. Iba H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The kinetics of Fra-2 expression correlated well with the AP-1 DNA binding activity (Fig.1A). By contrast, c-Fos levels remained steady throughout the differentiation (Fig. 2A). Differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes requires the cells to grow in suspension as aggregates before they will be attached onto tissue culture dishes (39McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Since AP-1 activity was prominently increased after the cells were plated onto tissue culture dishes, we wanted to exclude the possibility that the induction of AP-1 activity was dependent on adhesion and not caused by the differentiation response. The cells were cultured in suspension as aggregates and analyzed at several time points for AP-1 DNA binding activity and c-jun mRNA expression. Interestingly, the differentiation response did not require cell adhesion, since beating cell aggregates were observed in suspension cultures after 6 days of induction. More importantly, we found that AP-1 activity and c-jun mRNA levels were gradually induced in cell aggregates along the differentiation response (Fig.3). The kinetics of cardiomyocyte differentiation, AP-1 activity, and c-jun mRNA expression in cells grown as aggregates in suspension were similar to cells, which were attached (Figs. 1, 2B, and 3). The results exclude the po"

Several splice variants of DCLK(doublecortin-like kinase) have previously been reported. Here, we report the genomic organization underlying the splice variants of DCLK and examine the expression profile of two splice variants affecting the kinase domain of DCLK and CPG16 (candidate plasticity gene 16), one containing an Arg-rich domain and the other affecting the C terminus of the protein. These splice alternatives were differentially expressed in embryonic and adult brain. Both splice variants disrupted DCLK PEST domains; however, all splice variants remained sensitive to proteolysis by calpain. The adult-specific C-terminal splice variant of DCLK had reduced autophosphorylation activity, but similar kinase activity for myelin basic protein relative to the embryonic splice variant. The splice variant adding an Arg-rich domain gained an autophosphorylation site at Ser-382. Although this protein isoform was expressed mainly in the adult brain, the phosphorylated form was strongly enriched in embryonic brain and adult olfactory bulb, suggesting a possible role in migrating neurons.

The majority of neuronal cells in the central nervous system are generated during embryogenesis and persist throughout life without further rounds of division and differentiation. Individual neurons accomplish an array of distinct tasks during their life span, including cellular migration, axon extension and pathfinding, synaptogenesis, and participation in mature nervous system function. It has been suggested that to deal with these diverse demands on cellular function, the repertoire of neuronal gene products is enhanced by alternative splicing and RNA editing. Following the description of differential RNA processing of the calcitonin gene (1Amara S.G. Jonas V. Rosenfeld M.G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M.

Reiner O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36397-36403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This event releases an active kinase domain from the DCLK microtubule anchorage domain and may therefore represent a mechanism for regulating the localization of the kinase domain in response to neuronal calcium transients. Although no consensus sequence for calpain substrates has been identified, many proteins cleaved by calpain contain hydrophilic motifs enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST domains) (14Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 15Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Splice forms of DCLK disrupt the PEST domains, potentially altering its susceptibility to proteolysis. Differential splicing potentially modulates kinase activity. The C-terminal tail of calmodulin kinase I has been shown to fold across the active site of the kinase (16Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J.

Martinez S. Reiner O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two splice variants affecting the final coding exon of DCLK have been described (9Burgess H.A.

A second promoter following the doublecortin domain gives rise to two distinct transcripts: CPG16, which represents the kinase domain with six unique amino acids at the N terminus (7Silverman M.A. Benard O.

DCLKα is susceptible to cleavage by the calcium-dependent protease calpain (13Burgess H.A. Reiner O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36397-36403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This event releases an active kinase domain from the DCLK microtubule anchorage domain and may therefore represent a mechanism for regulating the localization of the kinase domain in response to neuronal calcium transients. Although no consensus sequence for calpain substrates has been identified, many proteins cleaved by calpain contain hydrophilic motifs enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST domains) (14Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 15Wang K.K. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Splice forms of DCLK disrupt the PEST domains, potentially altering its susceptibility to proteolysis. Differential splicing potentially modulates kinase activity. The C-terminal tail of calmodulin kinase I has been shown to fold across the active site of the kinase (16Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and the homologous segment modulates kinase activity in several serine-threonine kinases (17Francis S.H.

Progression of the cell cycle is associated with the phase-specific induction of genes whose products control the cell cycle or are involved in DNA replication (1Müller R. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 173-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transcription of several genes induced at the G1/S transition is mainly controlled by the E2F pathway (2Bartek J. Lukas J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). E2F complexes can act either as transcription repressors or activators depending on their target genes and the phase of the cell cycle. While transcription repression is generally achieved by binding of retinoblasma-type proteins (RB) 1The abbreviations used are: RBretinoblastomaPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRNRribonucleotide reductaseNDPsribonucleoside diphosphatesdNDPsdeoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, LUC, luciferaseGUSβ-glucuronidaseHUhydroxyureaWTwild typeMUmutatedCPcontrol promoter 1The abbreviations used are: RBretinoblastomaPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRNRribonucleotide reductaseNDPsribonucleoside diphosphatesdNDPsdeoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, LUC, luciferaseGUSβ-glucuronidaseHUhydroxyureaWTwild typeMUmutatedCPcontrol promoter to E2F factors (3Black A.R.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), repression of the PAI-1 gene is carried out by direct binding of E2F to its target motif (4Koziczak M. Krek W. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation is triggered when the E2F factor is associated to its DP partner. E2F-binding sites (TTTC/GC/GCGC) were identified in numerous gene promoters (5Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Some genes, such as cdc2 or B-Myb, appear to be strongly derepressed during the transition from G0 to G1 (i.e. quiescence to growth), while others, such as the p107 and DHFR genes, are up-regulated at the G1/S transition (6Helin K.

Biol. 2000; 43: 635-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the control of G1/S-phase-specific transcription in plants could be similar to that found in animals. Up to now, a few E2F target genes have been characterized in plants. The two E2F motifs identified in the tobacco RNR2 promoter were shown to specifically interact with a tobacco E2F factor and to mediate up-regulation of the promoter at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (14Chaboute M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1987-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that Arabidopsis E2F1 factor binds an E2F motif in the promoter of a S-phase-regulated gene AtCDC6 (10de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Alternatively, two E2F cis-elements were found in the promoter of tobacco gene encoding the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Mutation of an E2F consensus element in the PCNA promoter has no clear effect on its activity during the cell cycle but does act as a repressor in differentiated cells (15Egelkrout E.M. Robertson D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1437-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a key enzyme in the pathway of DNA synthesis. It catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) in deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs), a rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis (16Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In all eukaryotes, ribonucleotide reductases belong to the RNR Class I in which the active enzyme consists of two large (R1) and two small (R2) subunits encoded by RNR1 and RNR2 genes, respectively. In yeast, two RNR2 (RNR2 and RNR4) genes and two RNR1 (RNR1 and RNR3) genes have been identified (17Wang P.J. Chabes A. Casagrande R. Tian X.C. Thelander L. Huffaker T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6114-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In mammals, two RNR2 genes (RNR2 and P53R2) and one RNR1 gene have been isolated (19Filatov D. Ingemarson R. Johansson E. Rova U. Thelander L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 903-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). RNR genes are differently induced depending on their function: for DNA replication in S phase (RNR2 and RNR1 genes in yeast and human) or for urgent DNA repair (yeast RNR3 and human P53R2 genes) in G1 and G2 arrests of the cell cycle. Interestingly, E2F sites are not involved in S phase-specific expression of RNR genes in mammals: RNR cell cycle regulation is mediated by a TFII-I binding initiator element in the mouse RNR1 promoter (21Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas a proximal NF-Y binding element is involved in S phase induction of mouse RNR2 gene (22Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Here, we show that RNR1b gene expression is strongly expressed in S phase in synchronized tobacco cells. One E2F site is identified in the RNR1b promoter, downstream from the TATA box and in the 5′-unstranslated region. We showed by gel shift assays that an E2F factor-containing nuclear complex binds to this site as does the purified tobacco E2F protein. The promoter drives S phase expression of a luciferase reporter gene and meristematic activity of a GUS reporter gene. Mutation of the E2F motif markedly decreases both activities of the RNR1b promoter. Thus for the first time in plants, a single E2F motif in the leader sequence is shown to act as a transcription activator of the tobacco RNR1b gene in S phase and meristems.DISCUSSIONIn a previous report, we identified two RNR1 cDNAs and one RNR2 cDNA (31Chabouté M.E. Combettes B. Clément B. Gigot C. Philipps G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since the coding regions of both RNR1 cDNAs are closely related, 3′-specific probes were necessary to distinguish the expression pattern of each cDNA. Interestingly, RNR1b expression is mainly observed in the S phase of the cell cycle, whereas overall RNR1 gene expression is detected both in the S phase and at the G2/M transition, suggesting there that the two RNR1 genes are differentially regulated during the cell cycle. Plant histone and PCNA genes (8Sekine M. Ito M. Uemukai K. Maeda Y. Nakagami H. Shinmyo A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Reichheld J.P. Sonobe S. Clément B. Chaubet N. Gigot C. Plant J. 1995; 7: 245-252Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) are expressed in the S phase but 1 h later than the RNR1b gene. When DNA replication is blocked in mid-S phase, after RNR gene induction, the RNR1b mRNA level first decreases then increases to its initial level and finally remains constant. In contrast, total RNR1 transcript levels sharply increased, suggesting that this overall response is mainly due to the RNR1a gene induction.2 These results indicate that different pathways regulate the RNR1 genes, leading to a different cell cycle expression. In yeast, the two RNR1 genes (RNR1 and RNR3) are differently regulated during the cell cycle and in response to a DNA synthesis block (39Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in mammals, one RNR2 gene is induced in S phase and the other (P53RNR2 gene) in response to urgent repair of DNA damage (20Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the S phase RNR2 gene is not transcriptionally regulated in response to a replication block, but the R2 protein level is stabilized by a controlled protein degradation (40Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that different modes of regulation of the RNR1 and/or RNR2 genes have evolved. In plants, further investigation is necessary to obtain an overview of the RNR regulation pathway.Transcriptional regulation of the RNR1b gene has revealed several interesting features. The RNR1b promoter sequence is the first to be cloned in plants and unlike its animal counterparts contains a single E2F site, TTTCCCGC, located in the leader sequence at −177 bp from ATG. The same motif was previously described in the tobacco RNR2 promoter (E2Fa, −355 bp from the ATG) and was identified in a reverse orientation in Arabidopsis (−258 from ATG) and rice (−279 bp) RNR1 promoters (GenBankTMaccession numbers AC007019 and AB023482). An identical motif was also found in various promoters of S phase-regulated genes such as the tobacco PCNA gene (15Egelkrout E.M. Robertson D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1437-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis, genes encoding CDC6, mini-chromosome maintenance, DNA polymerase α, or origin recognition complex component proteins (10de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In plants, the position of the E2F site is not conserved in the different promoters as in mammals (33Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a functional E2F motif in the leader sequence is not usual, since only human cyclin E promoter presents such features (34Le Cam L. Polanowska J. Fabbrizio E. Olivier M. Philips A., Ng Eaton E. Classon M. Geng Y. Sardet C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1878-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We show by gel-shift assays that in exponentionally growing cells, a nuclear complex associates specifically with the E2F site in the RNR1b promoter. In addition, the purified tobacco E2F factor interacts with this E2F motif. From reporter gene expression, we conclude that the E2F element plays an important role in the specific S phase induction of the RNR1b promoter. In the tobacco RNR2 promoter, the E2Fa site was previously described to bind the E2F factor and acts as an activator element (14Chaboute M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1987-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Similarly in Arabidopsis, the E2F site of the CDC6 promoter binds the AtE2F1 trans-activating factor in presence of DP (10de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In plants, the E2F element is directly involved in specific RNR gene induction, while this is not the case for yeast or mammal RNR genes (18Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 21Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In animals, expression of E2F-regulated genes mostly results from the concerted action of two E2F motifs throughout the cell cycle (41Di Fiore B. Guarguaglini G. Palena A. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10339-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42Liu N. Lucibello F.C. Engeland K. Muller R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2957-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In a few cases, such as the H2A gene, S phase induction is mediated by a single E2F site (43Oswald F. Dobner T. Lipp M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1889-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).When fused to the GUS reporter gene, the cloned RNR1b promoter (−601 to −15 bp) showed active in primary and secondary root meristems as well as in axillary meristems of developing plantlets, but not in the apical meristem. No GUS activity was detected in transgenic seedlings harboring the mutated E2F construct. These results indicate that the E2F element drives meristematic activity of the RNR1b promoter, especially in the axillary buds and lateral roots, which underlines the importance of the E2F motif in the S phase-specific induction of the RNR1b gene. Up to now in plants, specific GC-rich elements, such as octamer and nonamer or sites IIa and IIb, were shown to confer meristematic activity to the histone and PCNA promoters, respectively (44Chaubet N. Flenet M. Clement B. Brignon P. Gigot C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Kosugi S. Suzuka I. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 1995; 7: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, meristematic activity was found in the root meristems as well as in the apical and axillary meristems of growing plantlets. Since no RNR1b promoter activity is detected in the apical meristem, it will be particularly interesting to determine how RNR1b gene expression is regulated in the presence of plant hormones. Based on the role of E2F in PCNA gene regulation (15Egelkrout E.M. Robertson D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1437-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we can envisage that RNR1b gene regulation is modulated by the E2F element as follows; E2F might repress expression in differentiated tissues, while in the nondifferentiated cells (meristems) it confers S phase-specific expression.Next to the E2F motif, we also identified two other cis-elements in the RNR1b promoter, a c-Myb-like motif and a putative telo-box. Similar cis-elements have been identified in other plant RNR promoters from tobacco RNR2 and RNR1a genes (14Chaboute M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1987-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar),2Arabidopsis RNR2 and RNR1 genes (GenBankTM accession numbers AB023040and AC007019), and rice RNR1 gene (GenBankTMaccession number AB023482). Therefore, it is possible that MYB and telo elements play a role in E2F-mediated regulation of the plant RNR promoters. In animals, MYB target genes are under investigation and could be involved either in cellular housekeeping function or in cell growth and differentiation (46Bartley P.A. Lutwyche J.K. Gonda T.J. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). There are several lines of evidence suggesting that the c-MYB factor regulates transcription by activation or by repression (47Afroze T. Husain M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9062-9069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Telo-boxes were previously identified in plant genes encoding components of the translational apparatus or genes induced in cycling cells and were shown to act as co-regulators of transcription factors during the G1/S transition (35Manevski A. Bertoni G. Bardet C. Tremousaygue D. Lescure B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since a Purα-like DNA-binding protein binds to a plant telo-box (48Tremousaygue D. Manevski A. Bardet C. Lescure N. Lescure B. Plant J. 1999; 20: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it is tempting to postulate that Purα could modulate the E2F activity as described in mammals (49Darbinian N. Gallia G.L. Kundu M. Shcherbik N. Tretiakova A. Giordano A. Khalili K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6398-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In several cases, E2F-mediated activation does not simply result from the E2F site function but also from the cooperative effect of YY1-, SP1-, or NF-Y-binding sites (50Fry C.J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29583-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Additionally, the functional role of E2F is also dependent on its position relative to other regulatory elements in the promoter (41Di Fiore B. Guarguaglini G. Palena A. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10339-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we report for the first time in plants that a single E2F site located in the leader sequence of the RNR1b gene is involved in both cell cycle and plant developmental regulation. Further investigation will be necessary to identify the components of the E2F complex and to determine whether the MYB and telo elements play a role as E2F co-regulators in plants. Progression of the cell cycle is associated with the phase-specific induction of genes whose products control the cell cycle or are involved in DNA replication (1Müller R. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 173-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transcription of several genes induced at the G1/S transition is mainly controlled by the E2F pathway (2Bartek J. Lukas J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). E2F complexes can act either as transcription repressors or activators depending on their target genes and the phase of the cell cycle. While transcription repression is generally achieved by binding of retinoblasma-type proteins (RB) 1The abbreviations used are: RBretinoblastomaPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRNRribonucleotide reductaseNDPsribonucleoside diphosphatesdNDPsdeoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, LUC, luciferaseGUSβ-glucuronidaseHUhydroxyureaWTwild typeMUmutatedCPcontrol promoter 1The abbreviations used are: RBretinoblastomaPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRNRribonucleotide reductaseNDPsribonucleoside diphosphatesdNDPsdeoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, LUC, luciferaseGUSβ-glucuronidaseHUhydroxyureaWTwild typeMUmutatedCPcontrol promoter to E2F factors (3Black A.R. Azizkhan-Clifford J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), repression of the PAI-1 gene is carried out by direct binding of E2F to its target motif (4Koziczak M. Krek W. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation is triggered when the E2F factor is associated to its DP partner. E2F-binding sites (TTTC/GC/GCGC) were identified in numerous gene promoters (5Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Some genes, such as cdc2 or B-Myb, appear to be strongly derepressed during the transition from G0 to G1 (i.e. quiescence to growth), while others, such as the p107 and DHFR genes, are up-regulated at the G1/S transition (6Helin K.

Biol. 2000; 43: 635-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the control of G1/S-phase-specific transcription in plants could be similar to that found in animals. Up to now, a few E2F target genes have been characterized in plants. The two E2F motifs identified in the tobacco RNR2 promoter were shown to specifically interact with a tobacco E2F factor and to mediate up-regulation of the promoter at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (14Chaboute M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1987-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that Arabidopsis E2F1 factor binds an E2F motif in the promoter of a S-phase-regulated gene AtCDC6 (10de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Alternatively, two E2F cis-elements were found in the promoter of tobacco gene encoding the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Mutation of an E2F consensus element in the PCNA promoter has no clear effect on its activity during the cell cycle but does act as a repressor in differentiated cells (15Egelkrout E.M. Robertson D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1437-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a key enzyme in the pathway of DNA synthesis. It catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) in deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs), a rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis (16Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In all eukaryotes, ribonucleotide reductases belong to the RNR Class I in which the active enzyme consists of two large (R1) and two small (R2) subunits encoded by RNR1 and RNR2 genes, respectively. In yeast, two RNR2 (RNR2 and RNR4) genes and two RNR1 (RNR1 and RNR3) genes have been identified (17Wang P.J. Chabes A. Casagrande R. Tian X.C. Thelander L. Huffaker T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6114-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In mammals, two RNR2 genes (RNR2 and P53R2) and one RNR1 gene have been isolated (19Filatov D. Ingemarson R. Johansson E. Rova U. Thelander L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 903-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). RNR genes are differently induced depending on their function: for DNA replication in S phase (RNR2 and RNR1 genes in yeast and human) or for urgent DNA repair (yeast RNR3 and human P53R2 genes) in G1 and G2 arrests of the cell cycle. Interestingly, E2F sites are not involved in S phase-specific expression of RNR genes in mammals: RNR cell cycle regulation is mediated by a TFII-I binding initiator element in the mouse RNR1 promoter (21Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas a proximal NF-Y binding element is involved in S phase induction of mouse RNR2 gene (22Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we show that RNR1b gene expression is strongly expressed in S phase in synchronized tobacco cells. One E2F site is identified in the RNR1b promoter, downstream from the TATA box and in the 5′-unstranslated region. We showed by gel shift assays that an E2F factor-containing nuclear complex binds to this site as does the purified tobacco E2F protein. The promoter drives S phase expression of a luciferase reporter gene and meristematic activity of a GUS reporter gene. Mutation of the E2F motif markedly decreases both activities of the RNR1b promoter. Thus for the first time in plants, a single E2F motif in the leader sequence is shown to act as a transcription activator of the tobacco RNR1b gene in S phase and meristems. DISCUSSIONIn a previous report, we identified two RNR1 cDNAs and one RNR2 cDNA (31Chabouté M.E. Combettes B. Clément B. Gigot C. Philipps G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since the coding regions of both RNR1 cDNAs are closely related, 3′-specific probes were necessary to distinguish the expression pattern of each cDNA. Interestingly, RNR1b expression is mainly observed in the S phase of the cell cycle, whereas overall RNR1 gene expression is detected both in the S phase and at the G2/M transition, suggesting there that the two RNR1 genes are differentially regulated during the cell cycle. Plant histone and PCNA genes (8Sekine M. Ito M. Uemukai K. Maeda Y. Nakagami H. Shinmyo A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Reichheld J.P. Sonobe S. Clément B. Chaubet N. Gigot C. Plant J. 1995; 7: 245-252Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) are expressed in the S phase but 1 h later than the RNR1b gene. When DNA replication is blocked in mid-S phase, after RNR gene induction, the RNR1b mRNA level first decreases then increases to its initial level and finally remains constant. In contrast, total RNR1 transcript levels sharply increased, suggesting that this overall response is mainly due to the RNR1a gene induction.2 These results indicate that different pathways regulate the RNR1 genes, leading to a different cell cycle expression. In yeast, the two RNR1 genes (RNR1 and RNR3) are differently regulated during the cell cycle and in response to a DNA synthesis block (39Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in mammals, one RNR2 gene is induced in S phase and the other (P53RNR2 gene) in response to urgent repair of DNA damage (20Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the S phase RNR2 gene is not transcriptionally regulated in response to a replication block, but the R2 protein level is stabilized by a controlled protein degradation (40Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that different modes of regulation of the RNR1 and/or RNR2 genes have evolved. In plants, further investigation is necessary to obtain an overview of the RNR regulation pathway.Transcriptional regulation of the RNR1b gene has revealed several interesting features. The RNR1b promoter sequence is the first to be cloned in plants and unlike its animal counterparts contains a single E2F site, TTTCCCGC, located in the leader sequence at −177 bp from ATG. The same motif was previously described in the tobacco RNR2 promoter (E2Fa, −355 bp from the ATG) and was identified in a reverse orientation in Arabidopsis (−258 from ATG) and rice (−279 bp) RNR1 promoters (GenBankTMaccession numbers AC007019 and AB023482). An identical motif was also found in various promoters of S phase-regulated genes such as the tobacco PCNA gene (15Egelkrout E.M. Robertson D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1437-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis, genes encoding CDC6, mini-chromosome maintenance, DNA polymerase α, or origin recognition complex component proteins (10de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In plants, the position of the E2F site is not conserved in the different promoters as in mammals (33Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a functional E2F motif in the leader sequence is not usual, since only human cyclin E promoter presents such features (34Le Cam L. Polanowska J. Fabbrizio E. Olivier M. Philips A., Ng Eaton E. Classon M. Geng Y. Sardet C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1878-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We show by gel-shift assays that in exponentionally growing cells, a nuclear complex associates specifically with the E2F site in the RNR1b promoter. In addition, the purified tobacco E2F factor interacts with this E2F motif. From reporter gene expression, we conclude that the E2F element plays an important role in the specific S phase induction of the RNR1b promoter. In the tobacco RNR2 promoter, the E2Fa site was previously described to bind the E2F factor and acts as an activator element (14Chaboute M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1987-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Similarly in Arabidopsis, the E2F site of the CDC6 promoter binds the AtE2F1 trans-activating factor in presence of DP (10de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In plants, the E2F element is directly involved in specific RNR gene induction, while this is not the case for yeast or mammal RNR genes (18Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 21Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In animals, expression of E2F-regulated genes mostly results from the concerted action of two E2F motifs throughout the cell cycle (41Di Fiore B. Guarguaglini G. Palena A. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10339-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42Liu N. Lucibello F.C. Engeland K. Muller R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2957-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In a few cases, such as the H2A gene, S phase induction is mediated by a single E2F site (43Oswald F. Dobner T. Lipp M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1889-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).When fused to the GUS reporter gene, the cloned RNR1b promoter (−601 to −15 bp) showed active in primary and secondary root meristems as well as in axillary meristems of developing plantlets, but not in the apical meristem. No GUS activity was detected in transgenic seedlings harboring the mutated E2F construct. These results indicate that the E2F element drives meristematic activity of the RNR1b promoter, especially in the axillary buds and lateral roots, which underlines the importance of the E2F motif in the S phase-specific induction of the RNR1b gene. Up to now in plants, specific GC-rich elements, such as octamer and nonamer or sites IIa and IIb, were shown to confer meristematic activity to the histone and PCNA promoters, respectively (44Chaubet N. Flenet M. Clement B. Brignon P. Gigot C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Kosugi S. Suzuka I. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 1995; 7: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interestingly, meristematic activity was found in the root meristems as well as in the apical and axillary meristems of growing plantlets. Since no RNR1b promoter activity is detected in the apical meristem, it will be particularly interesting to determine how RNR1b gene expression is regulated in the presence of plant hormones. Based on the role of E2F in PCNA gene regulation (15Egelkrout E.M. Robertson D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1437-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we can envisage that RNR1b gene regulation is modulated by the E2F element as follows; E2F might repress expression in differentiated tissues, while in the nondifferentiated cells (meristems) it confers S phase-specific expression.Next to the E2F motif, we also identified two other cis-elements in the RNR1b promoter, a c-Myb-like motif and a putative telo-box. Similar cis-elements have been identified in other plant RNR promoters from tobacco RNR2 and RNR1a genes (14Chaboute M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1987-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar),2Arabidopsis RNR2 and RNR1 genes (GenBankTM accession numbers AB023040and AC007019), and rice RNR1 gene (GenBankTMaccession number AB023482). Therefore, it is possible that MYB and telo elements play a role in E2F-mediated regulation of the plant RNR promoters. In animals, MYB target genes are under investigation and could be involved either in cellular housekeeping function or in cell growth and differentiation (46Bartley P.A. Lutwyche J.K. Gonda T.J. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). There are several lines of evidence suggesting that the c-MYB factor regulates transcription by activation or by repression (47Afroze T. Husain M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9062-9069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Telo-boxes were previously identified in plant genes encoding components of the translational apparatus or genes induced in cycling cells and were shown to act as co-regulators of transcription factors during the G1/S transition (35Manevski A. Bertoni G. Bardet C. Tremousaygue D. Lescure B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since a Purα-like DNA-binding protein binds to a plant telo-box (48Tremousaygue D. Manevski A. Bardet C. Lescure N. Lescure B. Plant J. 1999; 20: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it is tempting to postulate that Purα could modulate the E2F activity as described in mammals (49Darbinian N. Gallia G.L. Kundu M. Shcherbik N. Tretiakova A. Giordano A. Khalili K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6398-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In several cases, E2F-mediated activation does not simply result from the E2F site function but also from the cooperative effect of YY1-, SP1-, or NF-Y-binding sites (50Fry C.J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29583-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Additionally, the functional role of E2F is also dependent on its position relative to other regulatory elements in the promoter (41Di Fiore B. Guarguaglini G. Palena A. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10339-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we report for the first time in plants that a single E2F site located in the leader sequence of the RNR1b gene is involved in both cell cycle and plant developmental regulation. Further investigation will be necessary to identify the components of the E2F complex and to determine whether the MYB and telo elements play a role as E2F co-regulators in plants. In a previous report, we identified two RNR1 cDNAs and one RNR2 cDNA (31Chabouté M.E. Combettes B. Clément B. Gigot C. Philipps G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since the coding regions of both RNR1 cDNAs are closely related, 3′-specific probes were necessary to distinguish the expression pattern of each cDNA. Interestingly, RNR1b expression is mainly observed in the S phase of the cell cycle, whereas overall RNR1 gene expression is detected both in the S phase and at the G2/M transition, suggesting there that the two RNR1 genes are differentially regulated during the cell cycle. Plant histone and PCNA genes (8Sekine M. Ito M. Uemukai K. Maeda Y. Nakagami H. Shinmyo A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Reichheld J.P. Sonobe S. Clément B. Chaubet N. Gigot C. Plant J. 1995; 7: 245-252Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) are expressed in the S phase but 1 h later than the RNR1b gene. When DNA replication is blocked in mid-S phase, after RNR gene induction, the RNR1b mRNA level first decreases then increases to its initial level and finally remains constant. In contrast, total RNR1 transcript levels sharply increased, suggesting that this overall response is mainly due to the RNR1a gene induction.2 These results indicate that different pathways regulate the RNR1 genes, leading to a different cell cycle expression. In yeast, the two RNR1 genes (RNR1 and RNR3) are differently regulated during the cell cycle and in response to a DNA synthesis block (39Elledge S.J. Davis R.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in mammals, one RNR2 gene is induced in S phase and the other (P53RNR2 gene) in response to urgent repair of DNA damage (20Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the S phase RNR2 gene is not transcriptionally regulated in response to a replication block, but the R2 protein level is stabilized by a controlled protein degradation (40Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that different modes of regulation of the RNR1 and/or RNR2 genes have evolved.

Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In plants, the position of the E2F site is not conserved in the different promoters as in mammals (33Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Similarly in Arabidopsis, the E2F site of the CDC6 promoter binds the AtE2F1 trans-activating factor in presence of DP (10de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant Mol.

Interestingly, meristematic activity was found in the root meristems as well as in the apical and axillary meristems of growing plantlets. Since no RNR1b promoter activity is detected in the apical meristem, it will be particularly interesting to determine how RNR1b gene expression is regulated in the presence of plant hormones. Based on the role of E2F in PCNA gene regulation (15Egelkrout E.M. Robertson D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1437-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we can envisage that RNR1b gene regulation is modulated by the E2F element as follows; E2F might repress expression in differentiated tissues, while in the nondifferentiated cells (meristems) it confers S phase-specific expression. Next to the E2F motif, we also identified two other cis-elements in the RNR1b promoter, a c-Myb-like motif and a putative telo-box. Similar cis-elements have been identified in other plant RNR promoters from tobacco RNR2 and RNR1a genes (14Chaboute M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1987-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar),2Arabidopsis RNR2 and RNR1 genes (GenBankTM accession numbers AB023040and AC007019), and rice RNR1 gene (GenBankTMaccession number AB023482). Therefore, it is possible that MYB and telo elements play a role in E2F-mediated regulation of the plant RNR promoters. In animals, MYB target genes are under investigation and could be involved either in cellular housekeeping function or in cell growth and differentiation (46Bartley P.A. Lutwyche J.K. Gonda T.J. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). There are several lines of evidence suggesting that the c-MYB factor regulates transcription by activation or by repression (47Afroze T. Husain M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9062-9069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Telo-boxes were previously identified in plant genes encoding components of the translational apparatus or genes induced in cycling cells and were shown to act as co-regulators of transcription factors during the G1/S transition (35Manevski A. Bertoni G. Bardet C. Tremousaygue D. Lescure B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since a Purα-like DNA-binding protein binds to a plant telo-box (48Tremousaygue D. Manevski A. Bardet C. Lescure N. Lescure B. Plant J. 1999; 20: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it is tempting to postulate that Purα could modulate the E2F activity as described in mammals (49Darbinian N. Gallia G.L. Kundu M. Shcherbik N. Tretiakova A. Giordano A. Khalili K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6398-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In several cases, E2F-mediated activation does not simply result from the E2F site function but also from the cooperative effect of YY1-, SP1-, or NF-Y-binding sites (50Fry C.J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29583-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Additionally, the functional role of E2F is also dependent on its position relative to other regulatory elements in the promoter (41Di Fiore B. Guarguaglini G. Palena A. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10339-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we report for the first time in plants that a single E2F site located in the leader sequence of the RNR1b gene is involved in both cell cycle and plant developmental regulation. Further investigation will be necessary to identify the components of the E2F complex and to determine whether the MYB and telo elements play a role as E2F co-regulators in plants. We thank Dr L. Mankin for supplying the LUC-int vector, Calgene for providing the PCGN vector, and Dr. Sekine for the kind gift of the tobacco E2F factor. We also thank R.

https://openalex.org/W2062876845,"Serotonin N-acetyltransferase (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT)) is a critical enzyme in the light-mediated regulation of melatonin production and circadian rhythm. It is a member of the GNAT (GCN-5-related N -acetyltransferase) superfamily of enzymes, which catalyze a diverse array of biologically important acetyl transfer reactions from antibiotic resistance to chromatin remodeling. In this study, we probed the functional properties of two histidines (His-120 and His-122) and a tyrosine (Tyr-168) postulated to be important in the mechanism of AANAT based on prior x-ray structural and biochemical studies. Using a combination of steady-state kinetic measurements of microviscosity effects and pH dependence on the H122Q, H120Q, and H120Q/H122Q AANAT mutants, we show that His-122 (with an apparent p Ka of 7.3) contributes ∼6-fold to the acetyltransferase chemical step as either a remote catalytic base or hydrogen bond donor. Furthermore, His-120 and His-122 appear to contribute redundantly to this function. By analysis of the Y168F AANAT mutant, it was demonstrated that Tyr-168 contributes ∼150-fold to the acetyltransferase chemical step and is responsible for the basic limb of the pH-rate profile with an apparent (subnormal) p Ka of 8.5. Paradoxically, Y168F AANAT showed 10-fold enhanced apparent affinity for acetyl-CoA despite the loss of a hydrogen bond between the Tyr phenol and the CoA sulfur atom. The X-ray crystal structure of Y168F AANAT bound to a bisubstrate analog inhibitor showed no significant structural perturbation of the enzyme compared with the wild-type complex, but revealed the loss of dual inhibitor conformations present in the wild-type complex. Taken together with kinetic measurements, these crystallographic studies allow us to propose the relevant structural conformations related to the distinct alkyltransferase and acetyltransferase reactions catalyzed by AANAT. These findings have significant implications for understanding GNAT catalysis and the design of potent and selective inhibitors.

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced in the brain by the pineal gland and controls behavioral and physiological circadian rhythms. The production of this hormone is dependent on the enzyme serotonin N-acetyltransferase (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) 1The abbreviations used are: AANATarylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (serotonin N-acetyltransferase)MES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidEPPSN-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acidCHES2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferaser.m.s.d.root mean square difference ), which fluctuates in response to light and dark signals and is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway (see Fig. 1 A) (1Klein D.C.

Res. 1997; 52: 307-357PubMed Google Scholar). Concurrent with the fluctuation in AANAT, the level of circulating melatonin is high at night and low during the day (1Klein D.C. Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Weller J.L. Bernard M. Gastel J.A. Zatz M. Iuvone P.M. Rodriquez I.R. Begay V. Falcon J. Cahill G.M. Cassone V.M. Baler R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 307-357PubMed Google Scholar). Upon sudden exposure to light in the middle of the night, levels of melatonin and AANAT decrease rapidly with a half-life of ∼3.5 min (2Gastel J.A. Roseboom P.H. Rinaldi P.A. Weller J.L. Klein D.C.

This superfamily has members found in all kingdoms of life and is characterized by a common substrate, acetyl-CoA, and a structural fold where acetyl-CoA binds (3Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The primary sequences of these enzymes are poorly conserved, reflecting their ability to acetylate a variety of different substrates from histones to aminoglycoside antibiotics (3Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 4Marmorstein R. J. Mol.

Previous work has shown that AANAT follows an ordered Bi Bi ternary complex mechanism in its catalysis of acetyl transfer, with acetyl-CoA binding to the enzyme first, followed by the binding of serotonin or tryptamine (6De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Alternative substrates and pH-rate studies on AANAT revealed that ionizability of two or more groups, a potential catalytic base and acid, may be important in the reaction mechanism (7Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Using the knowledge that both substrates bind to the enzyme simultaneously, a potent inhibitor (Ki = 50 nm) was developed that incorporates both acetyl-CoA and serotonin (Fig. 1 B) (8Khalil E. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6195-6196Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that AANAT itself can catalyze the formation of the bisubstrate analog via a newly discovered “alkyltransferase activity” (Fig. 1 B) (9Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Ishii M. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12418-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Zheng W. Scheibner K.A. Ho A.K. Cole P.A. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This activity, catalyzed in an apparently subtly altered form of the acetyltransferase active site (9Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Ishii M. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12418-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Zheng W. Scheibner K.A. Ho A.K. Cole P.A. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), allows for the delivery of a cell permeable “prodrug” form of the inhibitor. The bisubstrate analog inhibitor has been used in complex with AANAT to obtain high resolution crystal structures of the enzyme (11Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Cell. 1999; 97: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Wolf E., De Angelis J. Khalil E.M. Cole P.A. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These crystal structures show possible residues that may play a role in catalysis (Fig. 2). Based on these structural studies and preliminary kinetic analysis, Tyr-168, His-120, and His-122 have been proposed to be catalytic residues (11Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Cell. 1999; 97: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this work, we examined the mechanistic function of these three residues in greater detail to attempt to identify more definitive roles for these residues in AANAT catalysis. Not only should this knowledge be useful in relating AANAT to other GNAT family members, it may also provide clues to the development of specific inhibitors of AANAT that might be used to treat mood and sleep disorders (13Arendt J. Melatonin and the Mammalian Pineal Gland. Chapman and Hall, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Tryptamine,N ω-methyltryptamine, racemic α-methyltryptamine, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), glutathione-agarose, coenzyme A, MES, MOPS, EPPS, and CHES were acquired from Sigma. Acetyl-CoA was purchased from AmershamBiosciences. Sucrose was purchased from Bio-Rad.N-Bromoacetyltryptamine (Fig. 1 B, compound1) and the bisubstrate analog (compound 2) were synthesized as previously described (8Khalil E. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6195-6196Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All AANAT mutants were prepared by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing. The mutants were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified as described previously (6De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), with several exceptions. Protein-expressing Escherichia coli strains were grown as previously described, except that inductions with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were performed at 16 °C for 22 h to enhance production of soluble protein. The GST-mutant fusion proteins were purified over a glutathione-agarose column after lysis by French press. The column (swelled from 0.8 g of resin) was equilibrated with 100 ml of lysis buffer prior to addition of the cleared lysate. The column was subsequently washed with 50 ml of lysis buffer and 200 mm NaCl, and the mutant proteins were eluted with 50 ml of lysis buffer, 110 mmNaCl, and 50 mm glutathione (pH 7.0) and collected in 10-ml fractions. Purity of the mutants (estimated to be >80% in all cases) was examined by 12% SDS-PAGE, and protein concentration was determined by Bradford analysis (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) referenced to bovine serum albumin. Mutant enzymes were studied as GST fusion proteins for the kinetic assays described. Previous work on the wild-type enzyme (6De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and current studies on Y168F (data not shown) show that GST does not greatly alter the kinetic characteristics of acetyl- or alkyltransferase reactions of the enzyme. Values for both kcat and Km of GST fusion proteins were within 2-fold of enzymes assayed without the affinity tag. The acetyltransferase activity of the GST fusion mutants was measured using a non-continuous spectrophotometric assay involving the liberation of a colored product from the reaction of CoASH with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) that was described previously (6De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in a final volume of 0.3 ml in buffer consisting of 0.05 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.5 mNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 30 °C. Varying amounts of acetyl-CoA (0.025–10 mm) and tryptamine (0.2–30 mm) were added to the reaction mixture, and reactions were initiated with enzyme diluted in the buffer described above, with final enzyme concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1 μm, depending upon the mutant. Reactions were quenched with a guanidinium solution (0.3 ml; 3.2 m guanidinium chloride in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.8)), and 0.05 ml of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (2 mm) was added prior to taking readings at 412 nm. Reaction rates were measured under initial conditions (linear with respect to time and enzyme concentration, <10% turnover of the limiting substrate). Assays involving Km measurements were conducted with a near-saturating concentration (Km > 3) of the unvaried substrate. All viscosity assays were performed in the same buffer and under the same conditions as described above. The sucrose solutions and relative viscosities were the same as described (7Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Tryptamine Km values were assayed at each of the varied sucrose solutions, with the exception of H120A and H122A, for which the Km values were measured at the high and low points only and were not significantly altered in response to these changing sucrose levels. Viscosity studies were run with tryptamine on the Y168F, H120Q, H122Q, H120Q/H122Q, H120A, and H122A AANAT mutants with final enzyme concentrations of 500, 50, 50, 250, 100, and 100 nm, respectively. Controls were run for Y168F AANAT with α-methyltryptamine using a final enzyme concentration of 2 μm and for the H120Q and H122Q AANAT mutants with N ω-methyltryptamine at a final enzyme concentration of 250 nm. Viscosity effects on the steady-state kinetic parameters of the mutants were determined, as in Ref. 7Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, from Equation 1, (kcat(control)/kcat(viscogen) versus relative viscosity)slope=k2/(k2+k30)Equation 1 where k2 is the rate constant for the chemical step and k3 0 represents the rate constant for product release in the absence of viscogen, as in previous studies (7Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This equation assumes the formation of a fully saturated ternary complex, followed by the chemical reaction and then product release. Measurements of kcat and tryptamine Km were performed as described above and, under the conditions previously reported (7Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), over a pH range of 6.0–8.5. The buffers used in these reactions were as follows: MES (pH 6.0–6.7), MOPS (pH 6.7–7.6), EPPS (pH 7.7–8.5), and CHES (pH 8.3–8.5). All mutant enzymes had linear activities at each pH within the time used for the assays, and all were found to exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics at these pH values. Curve fits for kcat and kcat/Km data were calculated as described previously (7Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These were carried out with a range of inhibitor (compound 2) concentrations as described (9Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Ishii M. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12418-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) using a Dixon analysis to give an apparent Ki assuming a competitive inhibition model. Assays for alkyltransferase activity were carried out as described previously (9Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Ishii M. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12418-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Zheng W. Scheibner K.A. Ho A.K. Cole P.A. Chem.

Briefly, the reaction conditions contained 50 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl at 30 °C. The products were separated and quantified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and UV detection using the authentic materials as standards (9Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Ishii M.

The Km for N-bromoacetyltryptamine (compound 1) was determined using a range of 0.025–2.5 mm in the presence of a constant and near-saturating concentration of CoASH (1 mm). The measurement of the Km for CoASH employed a concentration range of 0.025–3.0 mm with fixed and saturating N-bromoacetyltryptamine (compound1; 2 mm). The final enzyme concentrations ranged from 3.5 to 20 μm; and in all cases, the limiting substrate was at least 5-fold higher than the enzyme concentration. In all cases, the background (nonenzymatic) rates were subtracted from the rate in the presence of enzyme to give the net enzymatic rate. Reaction rates were measured under initial conditions (linear with respect to time and enzyme concentration, <10% turnover of the limiting substrate). GST-AANAT Y168F protein was proteolytically cleaved of GST and purified over glutathione- and CoA-agarose resins as described previously (9Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Ishii M. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12418-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Crystals of the Y168F AANAT mutant bound to compound 2 were obtained using previously published procedures (12Wolf E., De Angelis J. Khalil E.M. Cole P.A. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar): space group C2221; unit cell dimensions a = 53,b = 69, and c = 89 Å; and one enzyme-inhibitor complex/asymmetric unit. Cocrystals were cryoprotected with 100 mm MES (pH 6.5), 30% polyethylene glycol 2000, 100 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2% (v/v) 2,4-methylpentanediol, 20% glycerol, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm spermidine, and 100 mm LiCl and frozen by immersion in liquid propane. Diffraction data were collected under standard cryogenic conditions on Beamline X4A (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory). Following data processing with DENZO/SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), initial phases were obtained with our structure of the wild-type enzyme bound to compound 2(Protein Data Bank code 1L0C). Rigid body refinement and Powell minimization with CNS (15Brunger A. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kuntsleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T.

The current 2.3-Å refinement model for the structure contains residues 30–195, compound 2 in one conformation, and 90 water molecules, giving an R-factor of 19.3% and a free R-value of 24.6% with excellent stereochemistry (16Laskowski R.J.

Open table in a new tab Based on the x-ray structure of AANAT bound to compound 2, Tyr-168 appears to make a hydrogen bond with the CoA sulfur atom (11Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C.

Biol. 2002; 317: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Tyr-168 was mutated to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis to prevent the side chain from being able to participate in conventional hydrogen bonding or proton donation. This Y168F AANAT protein was expressed and purified in a manner similar to the wild-type enzyme. Interestingly, attempts at expressing Y168A AANAT were unsuccessful, presumably due to the instability of this protein. However, the Y168F AANAT mutant displayed catalytic activity that was linear with time and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, suggesting that it was sufficiently stable for kinetic studies. Kinetic analysis of Y168F AANAT showed a 30-fold lower kcatcompared with wild-type AANAT and altered Km values for both substrates (Table I). The Km value for acetyl-CoA decreased to 0.03 mm, whereas the tryptamine Km rose to 2.3 mm.Table ISteady-state kinetic values for AANAT and AANAT mutants in acetyltransferaseAANAT formkcatAcetyl-CoA KmTryptamine Km(s−1)(mm)(mm)Wild-type1-aTaken from Ref. 6.25 ± 10.29 ± 0.0130.17 ± 0.014Y168F0.75 ± 0.040.03 ± 0.022.3 ± 0.32H120Q24.5 ± 0.700.67 ± 0.031.2 ± 0.11H122Q18.1 ± 1.110.791 ± 0.084.78 ± 0.62H120Q/H122Q3.1 ± 0.071.11 ± 0.1410.9 ± 0.63H120A5.6 ± 0.151.3 ± 0.117.8 ± 0.59H122A8.9 ± 0.080.86 ± 0.062.8 ± 0.09H120A/H122A0.094 ± 0.0037.6 ± 0.604.6 ± 0.40H120E0.041-bApproximate due to the instability of the enzyme.H122E2.1 ± 0.031.5 ± 0.203.0 ± 0.15Values were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a Taken from Ref. 6De Angelis J.

Open table in a new tab Values were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To further understand the significance of these changes, analysis of the effects of the microviscogen sucrose on the kinetic parameters was performed. With appropriate controls, measurement of viscosity effects can be useful in determining the rate-limiting step of enzyme reactions because they can affect the diffusional processes, but not the chemical step(s) (17Blacklow S.C. Raines R.T. Lim W.A. Zamore P.D. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Previous viscosity studies (kcat(control)/kcat(viscogen) versus relative viscosity) have shown that the rate-limiting step of AANAT when tryptamine is used as a substrate is predominantly a diffusion-controlled process (slope = +0.75, theoretical maximum = 1.0), most likely product (CoASH) release (7Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, the chemical step of the reaction is rate-limiting when a “poor substrate” such as N ω-methyltryptamine is substituted for tryptamine (slope = +0.10) (7Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Poor substrates are often used as a control to detect any nonspecific effects of the viscogen on the enzyme (18Cole P.A. Burn P. Takacs B. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30880-30887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No detectable activity was seen with Y168F AANAT and N ω-methyltryptamine as a substrate. However, we showed that α-methyltryptamine behaves as a poor substrate with Y168F AANAT, with kcat = 0.013 s−1and Km = 4.2 mm, whereas with wild-type AANAT, α-methyltryptamine shows a kcat similar to the tryptamine reaction (7Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The slope of the kcat(control)/kcat(viscogen) versus relative viscosity plot for Y168F was found to be +0.38 using tryptamine as a substrate and +0.03 with α-methyltryptamine (Fig. 3). As expected with a poor substrate, the slope was virtually zero, indicating that the chemical step is indeed rate-limiting in this case. Despite the 30-fold lower kcat compared with the wild-type enzyme, the non-zero viscosity effect seen with tryptamine suggests unexpectedly that the chemical step is not fully rate-limiting in acetyl transfer catalyzed by this mutant. Thus, both the product release step and the chemical step are slowed by this mutation. Given the observation that the Km for acetyl-CoA is 10-fold lower with this mutant and the data described above, these results suggest that CoASH has a higher affinity for Y168F and is more slowly released. The removal of an ionizable amino acid residue important in catalysis could result in a change in the pH-rate profile of an enzyme. The profile of log(kcat/Km)versus pH for wild-type AANAT from previous work (7Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) shows that there is an acidic limb reflecting one ionizable group with a p Ka of 7.3 and a basic limb reflecting one ionizable group with a p Ka of 8.5 (Fig. 4 A). The pH-rate analysis of Y168F AANAT revealed a distinct change in the higher pH values of the pH-rate profile found on the log(kcat/Km)versus pH plot (Fig. 4 B). Although the acidic limb with a p Ka of 7.3 was maintained, the basic limb of the wild-type profile was now absent, suggesting that Tyr-168 has a p Ka of 8.5 and that Tyr-168 should be neutral for optimal activity. To further probe the active site structure of Y168F AANAT, the susceptibility of Y168F AANAT acetyltransferase activity to inhibition by the bisubstrate analog inhibitor (compound 2) was examined. Using a Dixon analysis, the extrapolated Ki of 50 nm was found to be essentially identical to that of compound 2 inhibition of the wild-type AANAT enzyme, arguing for the absence of large structural perturbation. The steady-state kinetic parameters for the alkyltransferase activity (9Khalil E.M., De Angelis J. Ishii M. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2002; 317: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) of Y168F AANAT with N-bromoacetyltryptamine (compound 1) were measured and are displayed in Table II. They reveal a 290-fold reduction in kcat for the Y168F mutant enzyme compared with wild-type AANAT. The Km values for the substrates of this reaction indicate that the apparent affinity of both substrates for the enzyme increased. The Km for CoASH dropped 5-fold (comparable to the Km drop for acetyl-CoA in the acetyltransferase reaction), whereas that for N-bromoacetyltryptamine (compound 1) was reduced more dramatically by 120-fold. Because the chemical step is likely to be rate-determining for this mutant (10Zheng W. Scheibner K.A. Ho A.K. Cole P.A. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we can make the assumption that rapid equilibrium conditions apply. Under these conditions, the measured substrate Km is representative of the dissociation constant (Kd). The fact that both the wild-type enzyme and mutant yielded similar Ki values for the bisubstrate analog (compound 2) indicates that the rate of product release for both enzymes is similar. Therefore, the reduced Km for N-bromoacetyltryptamine (compound 1) is suggestive of an"

Expression of dominant-positive H-Ras (V12-H-Ras) enhanced the host cell reactivation of luciferase activity from UV-irradiated and cisplatin-treated plasmids and also increased the unscheduled DNA synthesis following cisplatin or UV treatment of cells. This observed enhancement of DNA repair capacity was inhibited by transient transfection with dominant-negative H-Ras (N17-H-Ras) or Rac1 (N17-Rac1) plasmids. Moreover, stable transfection of dominant-positive Rac1 (V12-Rac1) further enhanced DNA repair capacity. Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to be a downstream effector of oncogenic Ras, we examined the role of ROS in DNA repair capacity. We found that ROS production by V12-H-Ras expression was mediated by the Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Rac1/NADPH oxidase-dependent pathway and that pretreatment of V12-H-Ras-transformed cells with an antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine) and an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (diphenyleneiodonium) decreased DNA repair capacity. Similarly, treatment with PI3K inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) inhibited the ability of oncogenic H-Ras to enhance DNA repair capacity. Furthermore, inhibition of the Ras/PI3K/Rac1/NADPH oxidase pathway resulted in increased sensitivity to cisplatin and UV in V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells. Taken together, these results provide evidence that oncogenic H-Ras activates DNA repair capacity through the Ras/PI3K/Rac1/NADPH oxidase-dependent pathway and that increased ROS production via this signaling pathway is required for enhancement of the DNA repair capacity induced by oncogenic H-Ras.

The cellular Ras protein, which is normally activated by growth factor receptors, is a mediator of those intracellular signaling pathways that are responsible for regulating cell proliferation (1Boguski M.S.

Nature. 1986; 319: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Point mutation in the ras gene occurs at high frequency in mammalian cells, resulting in transformation and malignant progression to cancer, with oncogenic Ras mutations occurring in ∼30% of all human tumors (4Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). This active mutant form of Ras may induce drug resistance mechanisms, including enhanced DNA repair activity (5Levy E. Baroche C. Barret J.M. Alapetite C. Salles B. Averbeck D. Moustacchi E. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although a number of studies concerning the effect of Ras on DNA repair activity have been performed, the precise role of Ras in the regulation of DNA repair activity has not been fully elucidated. Several prior studies have provided evidence indicating that the Ras signaling pathway is involved in the down-regulation of DNA repair capacity (6Basnak'ian A.G. Topol L.Z. Kirsanova I.D. Votrin I.I. Kiselev F.L. Mol. Biol. 1989; 23: 750-757Google Scholar, 7Yen L. Zeng-Rong N. You X.L. Richard A. Langton-Webster B.C. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1827-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, others have suggested that Ras activation exhibits a resistance to cisplatin (8Skler M.D. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 793-797PubMed Google Scholar, 9Isonishi S. Hom D.K. Thiebaut F.B. Mann S.C.

Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 450-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which is associated with an increased DNA repair capacity for cisplatin-induced lesions (5Levy E. Baroche C. Barret J.M. Alapetite C. Salles B. Averbeck D. Moustacchi E. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, we therefore directly addressed the question of whether oncogenic Ras contributes to the regulation of DNA repair capacity. Because oncogenic Ras is known to participate in the development of carcinogenesis in many human cancers, understanding the molecular basis of oncogenic Ras-regulated DNA repair capacity could lead to strategies that improve anticancer therapeutic benefits.

The results show that expression of dominant-positive V12-H-Ras both protects NIH3T3 cells from UV- and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and enhances DNA repair capacity through the Ras/PI3K/Rac1/NADPH oxidase pathway, and increased ROS production via this signaling pathway is required for enhancement of the DNA repair capacity induced by oncogenic H-Ras. Cisplatin, N-acetylcysteine, and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) were purchased from Sigma. 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti-H-Ras and anti-Rac1 polyclonal antibodies were from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). PD98059, U0126, wortmannin, and LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem. Ponasterone A was purchased from Invitrogen. The NIH3T3 mouse embryo fibroblast line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2. The wild-type H-ras and rac1 cDNAs were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from human Jurkat cells. The dominant-positive and dominant-negative forms of H-Ras (V12-H-Ras and N17-H-Ras, respectively) and Rac1 (V12-Rac1 and N17-Rac1, respectively) were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis based on the wild-type H-ras or rac1 cDNA template (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After DNA sequence confirmation, the dominant-positive forms of H-ras and rac1 cDNAs were cloned into a pIND mammalian inducible expression vector driven by the ecdysone-responsive minimal promoter (Invitrogen), whereas the dominant-negative forms of H-ras and rac1 cDNAs were cloned into a pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 μg of pIND-V12-H-Ras or pIND-V12-Rac1 plasmid was incubated with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE Plus reagent at room temperature for 15 min; 2 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent was added; and the mixture was incubated at room temperature. After 15 min, semiconfluent NIH3T3 cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and then incubated with DNA-LipofectAMINE Plus reagent complexes at 37 °C in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2 for 4 h. After transfection, the mixture was aspirated, and cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15% fetal bovine serum for an additional 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated with complete medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 for 5 weeks. Cell clones resistant to G418 were isolated and analyzed. For convenience, one vector control-transfected, one V12-H-Ras-transfected, and one V12-Rac1-transfected cell clone were selected for further studies. Transfected cells were routinely cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. However, from 2 days prior to the experiments and throughout the duration of the experimental, transfected cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without G418. For transient transfection, 5 μg of dominant-negative N17-H-Ras or dominant-negative N17-Rac1 plasmid DNA was incubated with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent and then with LipofectAMINE reagent, after which semiconfluent NIH3T3 cells were incubated with DNA-LipofectAMINE Plus reagent complexes at 37 °C in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2 for 4 h. The transfection efficiency was determined using the Renilla luciferase gene-containing pRL-CMV plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). Host cell reactivation of luciferase activity was determined as described by Zeng et al. (24Zeng L. Sarasin A. Mezzina M. Henderson D.S. DNA Repair Protocols: Novel Complementation Assays for DNA Repair-deficient Cells. 1st Ed. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 87-100Google Scholar). The pGL3-Luc plasmid (Promega), in which the firefly luciferase gene is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used to estimate the capacity of cells to reactivate damaged plasmid. The pRM-CMV plasmid, in which the Renilla luciferase gene is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. For host cell reactivation assays, the pGL3-Luc plasmid was damaged in vitro by either exposure to 200, 400, or 800 J/m2 UV-C or treatment with 500, 750, or 1000 nm cisplatin. V12-H-Ras- or V12-Rac1-transfected NIH3T3 cells were then transiently transfected with 1 μg of treated pGL3-Luc plasmid/well and 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV plasmid/well using the LipofectAMINE Plus method following the manufacturer's instructions. After 4 h, cells were incubated in fresh medium with or without ponasterone A. The pRL-CMV plasmid was used to normalize for the total DNA transfected. After 4 h of transfection, the transfection medium was replaced with regular complete medium. In all cases, cells were collected 48 h after transfection, and cell extracts were used to determine luciferase activity. Luciferase activity values were quantified with a luminometer (Lumat LB9507, EG&G). To investigate whether the oncogenic H-Ras-coupled signaling pathway is required for the modulation of DNA repair, cells were cotransfected with either cisplatin-damaged or UV-irradiated pGL3-Luc and pRL-CMV in the presence of dominant-negative mutant N17-H-Ras (pcDNA3-N17-H-Ras), dominant-negative mutant N17-Rac1 (pcDNA3-N17-Rac1), or control empty vector (pcDNA3). Cotransfection experiments were performed using a concentration of 2 μg of each plasmid/well. pRL-CMV was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. After 4 h of transfection, the transfection medium was replaced with regular complete medium. Unscheduled DNA synthesis of a population of cells in 96-well plates was measured as described previously (7Yen L. Zeng-Rong N. You X.L. Richard A. Langton-Webster B.C. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1827-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded onto plates and then washed twice with PBS, and regular medium was substituted for arginine-free medium (MEM Select-Amine®, Invitrogen). After 24 h, the medium was changed to fresh arginine-free medium containing 1% serum for an additional 48 h. Cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, treated with 20 μm cisplatin or irradiated with 2 kJ/m2 UV-C in the presence of 10 μCi/ml [3H]dThd (specific activity of 20 Ci/mmol;Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h, washed twice with PBS, and then further cultured in fresh arginine-free medium containing 1% serum and 10 μCi/ml [3H]dThd for an additional 4 h. Finally, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and directly lysed with DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the DNA was extracted following the manufacturer's instructions. Unscheduled DNA synthesis was estimated as the ratio of (dpm/μg DNA in drug-treated cells) to (dpm/μg DNA incorporated in control cells) × 100. Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (PLB®, Promega) with gentle shaking at room temperature for 15 min. Cell lysates were cleared from debris by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Dual luciferase activity in the cell extracts was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Briefly, each assay mixture contained 20 μl of cell lysate and 100 μl of firefly luciferase-measuring buffer (LAR II®, Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was measured with the luminometer. (The luminometer was programmed to perform a 2-s pre-measurement delay, followed by a 10-s measurement period for each reporter assay.) After measuring the firefly luciferase activity, the reaction mixture was added to 100 μl of Renilla luciferase-measuring buffer (Stop & Glo®, Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was measured. Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize for transfection efficiency, and the relative luciferase activity was then calculated as a percentage of the experimental luciferase value relative to control levels using untreated pGL3-Luc reporter plasmids. All transfections were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. ROS were measured using a previously described method (25Suzukawa K. Miura K. Mitsushita J. Resau J. Hirose K. Crystal R. Kamata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13175-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, cells were plated at 1 × 105/plate in 60-mm dishes, treated for the indicated times, harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 5 μg/ml DCF-DA in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and the 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence intensity was measured with a fluorescence plate reader (FL600, Bio-Tek) (excitation wavelength, 485 nm; emission wavelength, 530 nm). Cells were centrifuged, washed with PBS, and lysed at 0 °C for 30 min in lysis buffer (20 mmHepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 50 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% β-glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 5 mm NaF). Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad dye binding microassay, and 20 μg of protein/lane was electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels after boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were blotted onto Hybond ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Colored markers (Bio-Rad) were used as size standards. After electroblotting, the membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% milk and incubated with the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h. Primary antibody dilutions were those recommended by the manufacturer. Membranes were then washed, incubated with the appropriate second antibody (1:3000) in blocking buffer for 1 h, and re-washed. Blotted proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (AmershamBiosciences). Cells were seeded at 4 × 105/25-cm culture flask and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then treated with cisplatin or UV-C, washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in fresh medium. They were counted with a Coulter counter, and the number of cells required for plating was obtained by successive dilutions in fresh complete medium. The cells were plated in triplicate in 100-mm Petri dishes over a homologous feeder layer formed 24 h previously by plating 5 × 104 irradiated cells. Cells were then allowed to grow at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere for 14 days. Fresh medium was added on day 7. On day 14, cultures were fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa. The number of colonies exceeding 50 cells was counted with a binocular lens. The survival fraction was determined as the ratio of the number of colonies observed after treatment to the number of cells seeded, adjusted to the plating efficiency. Data in all experiments are represented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were carried out using two-tailed Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. To understand the relationship between oncogenic H-Ras and the modulation of DNA repair capacity in NIH3T3 cells, the cells were stably transfected with oncogenic H-Ras through the pIND-V12-H-Ras plasmid construct under the control of the ecdysone-responsive minimal promoter. Following selection by G418 at 400 μg/ml for 5 weeks, we isolated several clones and analyzed H-Ras expression that was able to be turned on or off using ponasterone A. A particular NIH3T3-expressed V12-H-Ras clone, which expresses oncogenic H-Ras, was chosen for further study in this investigation. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the addition of 5 μm ponasterone A efficiently induced expression of V12-H-Ras. V12-H-Ras expression became detectable within 6 h of ponasterone A treatment, and the level of H-Ras protein was continuously elevated for the duration of ponasterone A treatment (Fig. 1 A). To investigate whether expression of V12-H-Ras has any effect on DNA repair capacity, we used the host cell reactivation of luciferase activity, which reflects the capacity of cells to repair plasmids damaged by UV or cisplatin. The pGL3-Luc reporter plasmid was treated with 200, 400, or 800 J/m2 UV-C or with 500, 750, or 1000 nmcisplatin. V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells were transfected with untreated, UV-irradiated, or cisplatin-treated pGL3-Luc plasmid and then added to ponasterone A to induce V12-H-Ras expression. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), V12-H-Ras-expressing cells significantly enhanced host cell reactivation of UV-irradiated or cisplatin-treated luciferase activity. This enhancement of host cell reactivation could be reduced by transient transfection with dominant-negative N17-H-Ras (data not shown), suggesting that enhancement of host cell reactivation results specifically from expression of V12-H-Ras. To further verify the effect of oncogenic H-Ras on DNA repair capacity, we performed unscheduled DNA synthesis, which reflects the cellular ability to repair damage to genomic DNA. V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells were treated with 20 μmcisplatin or 2 kJ/m2 UV-C in medium containing 10 μCi/ml [3H]dThd in the presence or absence of ponasterone A. As shown in Fig. 2, V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells were found to increase DNA repair synthesis by ∼60% compared with non-expressing cells.Figure 2Effect of oncogenic H-Ras on DNA repair synthesis. DNA repair synthesis was determined using the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells were incubated with or without ponasterone A (Pon A) and subsequently treated with 20 μm cisplatin or irradiated with 2 kJ/m2 UV-C in medium containing 1% serum and 10 μCi/ml [3H]dThd. After 2 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in fresh medium containing 1% serum and 10 μCi/ml [3H]dThd for an additional 4 h.

The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is a major signal transduction pathway activated by Ras, and PI3K is also one of the Ras effector molecules (26Marshall C.J.

To determine which pathway contributes to Ras-mediated DNA repair capacity, V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 or the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. Pretreatment of V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells with wortmannin or LY294002 decreased host cell reactivation, whereas PD98059 or U0126 did not exert any effect on host cell reactivation (Fig. 3,A and B). These results suggest that PI3K activity may be involved, at least in part, in enhancement of the DNA repair capacity induced by oncogenic H-Ras in NIH3T3 cells. Because Rac1 is known to be the downstream effector of the Ras signal transduction pathway, we next examined whether Rac1 participates in enhancement of DNA repair capacity in V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, transient transfection of V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells with dominant-negative N17-Rac1 decreased the host cell reactivation. To investigate further the effect of Rac1 on DNA repair capacity, NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with dominant-positive V12-Rac1. A particular NIH3T3-expressed V12-Rac1 clone was chosen, and then V12-Rac1 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5(B and C), V12-Rac1 expression resulted in enhancement of host cell reactivation in NIH3T3 cells compared with that in non-expressing cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the Ras/PI3K/Rac1 pathway may contribute in part to enhancement of the DNA repair capacity induced by oncogenic H-Ras in NIH3T3 cells.Figure 4Effect of dominant-negative N17-Rac1 on enhanced host cell reactivation by oncogenic H-Ras. V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells were transfected with either the UV-irradiated (A) or cisplatin-treated (B) pGL3-Luc reporter plasmid and pRL-CMV. After 4 h of transfection, the dominant-negative N17-Rac1 expression plasmid (pcDNA3-N17-Rac1) or empty expression plasmid (pcDNA3) was transiently transfected into V12-H-Ras-expressing NIH3T3 cells. The cells were then treated with 5 μm ponasterone A (Pon A) for 48 h, and cell extracts were prepared for luciferase activity assays.

Although this P-TEFb could phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)in vitro, in contrast to CycT1 and CycT2, CycK did not activate transcription when tethered to DNA. Interestingly, when the C termini of CycT1 and CycT2 or only the histidine-rich stretch from positions 481 to 551 in CycT1 were added to CycK, the extended chimeras activated transcription equivalently via DNA. Moreover, these transcriptional effects required the CTD of RNAPII in cells. Thus, CycK functions as P-TEFb only via RNA, which suggests the presence of cellular RNA-bound activators that require CycK for their transcriptional activity.

They include P-TEFb and the negative transcription elongation factor (N-TEF) (1.Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 2.Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 3.Reines D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this scheme, RNAPII can initiate but not elongate because of its interaction with N-TEF (2.Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 4.Garber M.E. Jones K.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Most likely, N-TEF is composed of the 5,6-dichloro-1β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) and the negative elongation factor (NELF). DSIF contains SPT4 (14 kDa) and SPT5 (160 kDa) (5.Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 6.Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y.

NELF contains four subunits, of which the NELF-E/RD subunit contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) (7.Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Watanable D. Takagi T. Hasegawa J. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8085-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). P-TEFb is then recruited to the transcription complex, where its kinase subunit phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII (8.Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol.

P-TEFb was first identified as the factor that was required for the reconstitution of DRB sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster (8.Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Over the past 2 years, different P-TEFb complexes have been identified. These heterodimers contain a catalytic subunit, Cdk9, and a regulatory subunit, which can be CycT1, CycT2, or CycK (12.Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

CycT1, CycT2a, CycT2b, and CycK share extensive sequence similarity in their cyclin boxes at the N terminus from positions 1 to 250, which contain the Cdk9 binding domains. CycT1, CycT2a, and CycT2b also contain long C-terminal extensions, but their sequences diverge significantly. However, CycK is relatively small. It contains a short C-terminal domain of 107 residues from positions 251 to 357.

Tat is expressed early in the replicative cycle of HIV and is essential for viral gene expression and replication (21.Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). It recognizes the 5′-bulge in the transactivation response (TAR) stem loop RNA, which is located at the 5′-end of all viral transcripts. Tat binds CycT1, and together, they form the combinatorial surface that interacts with the TAR RNA with high affinity and specificity (12.Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The obligate partner of CycT1, Cdk9, then phosphorylates the CTD of RNAPII. Thus, Tat promotes HIV transcription at the step of elongation rather than initiation (22.Kao S.Y. Calman A.F. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The key step in these effects of Tat is the recruitment of P-TEFb to RNAPII. These findings also raised the possibility that such a system may exist in higher eukaryotes where Tat homologs may recruit P-TEFb to RNA and activate transcription of cellular genes. CycK was first identified as a protein that could restore progression through the cell cycle and was most closely related to human cyclins C and H (23.Edwards M. Wong C. Elledge S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reports have also suggested that CycK associates with a potent Cdk kinase activity (CAK) in vitro. Recently, the kinase partner of CycK was identified as Cdk9 (14.Fu T.J. Peng J. Lee G. Price D.H. Flores O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34527-34530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This complex between CycK and Cdk9 could also function as a CTD kinase in vitro (14.Fu T.J. Peng J. Lee G. Price D.H. Flores O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34527-34530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, the role of CycK in transcriptional regulation has not been defined in vivo, and the question of whether CycK is solely a CAK or is also a transcriptional cyclin has not been answered. Additionally, this complex appears to play no role in Tat transactivation. Nevertheless, the understanding of other P-TEFb complexes should give us a more complete picture of the function of these transcription elongation factors. In this study, the ability of CycK to activate transcription when recruited to a complete promoter via RNA or DNA was examined. First, we tethered CycK to RNA. Later, we fused the C termini of CycT1 or CycT2 (more precisely the histidine-rich stretch from CycT1 to the C terminus of CycK) and then tethered these hybrid proteins to DNA. We discovered that CycK can function as a transcriptional cyclin only via RNA, and the histidine-rich stretch from CycT1 confers its ability to function via DNA in vivo. Plasmids coding for the HIV-1 long terminal repeat where TAR was replaced by stem loop IIB (SLIIB) from the Rev (regulator of expression of virion genes) response element (RRE) linked to the CAT reporter gene (pRRESCAT), Rev·Cdk9 chimera (pRevCdk9) and kinase-negative Rev·Cdk9D167N (pRevCdk9D167N) fusion proteins had been described previously (24.Tiley L.S.

The plasmid effector pRev contains the cDNA copy of the HIV-1 Rev gene under control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, which was present in the parental pBC12/CMV plasmid. A full-length CycK cDNA EcoRI fragment and anEcoRI fragment of the CycT1 cDNA sequence encoding amino acids 1–280 were cloned into the pRev vector and fused in-frame with the C terminus of Rev to construct pRevCycK and pRevCycT1(1–280), respectively. Plasmid pGal (pSG424) has been described before (26.Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). It contains the coding sequence of GAL4-(1–147) immediately followed by a multiple cloning site. GAL4-(1–147) binds specifically to the upstream activator sequences, but does not activate transcription (27.Ma J. Ptashne M.

CycT1 fragments from positions 301 to 726 and 481 to 551 and the CycT2 fragment from positions 301 to 730 as well as the full-length CycK fragment were cloned into pGal to construct pGalCycT1(301–726), pGalCycT1(481–551), pGalCycT2(301–730), and pGalCycK, respectively. All these expressed hybrid proteins fused in-frame with the C terminus of the Gal4 protein.

At 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed, and CAT activities were measured with a liquid scintillation assay as described previously (29.Cujec T.P. Okamoto H. Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 293T cells were mock-transfected or transfected with pGalCycK by Liptofectamine. At 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the α-Gal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Immunoprecipitations, which were bound to protein A-Sepharose beads, were washed three times with lysis buffer and then two times with CTD kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol). Approximately 25 ng of the eluted GST·CTD fusion proteins (29.Cujec T.P. Okamoto H. Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) were used in each kinase reaction. Reactions were supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 50 μm unlabeled ATP or 50 μm unlabeled ATP, by itself, in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. For radiolabeled kinase reactions, samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and then exposed to film. For unlabeled kinase reactions, samples were analyzed by Western blotting. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was electroblotted onto Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with H14 or H5 antibodies against the phosphorylated CTD at serine 5 or serine 2 (BabCO, Berkeley, CA). To determine whether CycK can activate transcription via RNA, we used a heterologous RNA tethering system, where CycK was fused to Rev from HIV. Rev binds with high affinity and specificity to the stem loop IIB (SLIIB) of Rev response element (RRE) RNA, which was grafted onto the double-stranded stem in TAR (pRRESCAT) (24.Tiley L.S. Malim M.H. Tewary H.K. Stockley P.G. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that CycT1 and Cdk9 activated transcription when fused to Rev (25.Fujinaga K. Cujec T.P. Peng J. Garriga J. Price D.H. Grana X. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the kinase-negative Cdk9 (Cdk9D167N) protein was inactive in this system (25.Fujinaga K. Cujec T.P. Peng J. Garriga J. Price D.H. Grana X. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, a short version of human CycT1, the mutant CycT1-(1–280) protein, which contained N- and C-terminal helices and two cyclin boxes but lacked residues from positions 281 to 726, could rescue Tat transactivation in murine cells (25.Fujinaga K. Cujec T.P. Peng J. Garriga J. Price D.H. Grana X. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the truncated CycT1-(1–280) protein could activate transcription when recruited to TAR by Tat. CycK contains extensive sequence similarity with CycT1 and CycT2 in this region but then diverges in its short C terminus. In Fig. 1, we compared the activities of the hybrid Rev·CycK and Rev·CycT1-(1–280) proteins. These two chimeras activated transcription 10-fold from pRRESCAT in 293T cells (Fig. 1,lanes 3 and 4). This activity was one-half that of the hybrid Rev·Cdk9 protein (Fig. 1, lane 5), which is consistent with previous results where complexes between the full-length CycT1 and Cdk9 proteins had higher activities on the CTD substrate than those between CycK and Cdk9 in vitro (14.Fu T.J. Peng J. Lee G. Price D.H. Flores O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34527-34530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of the Rev·CycK fusion protein could be inhibited efficiently by DRB at concentrations between 10 and 20 μm (Fig. 2 A). The co-expression of the kinase-negative Cdk9 protein also blocked the transcriptional activity of the hybrid Rev·CycK protein on pRRESCAT (Fig. 2 B). The kinase-negative Cdk9 when fused to Rev also failed to activate transcription (Fig. 1 C, lane 6). These results indicate that CycK can activate transcription when tethered to RNA, which requires the kinase activity of Cdk9.Figure 2The kinase activity of Cdk9 is required for the activation of transcription by the Rev·CycK hybrid protein. A, DRB inhibits the activity of the Rev·CycK fusion protein. 293T cells were incubated with DRB for 24 h, and then Rev·CycK was co-expressed with pRRESCAT in these cells. Transfected cells were incubated with no (lane 3, white bar) or increasing concentrations of DRB (lanes 4–8, black bars). CAT activities are presented as -fold activation relative to basal levels of pRRESCAT alone or pRRESCAT co-expressed with Rev (lanes 1 and 2, white bars). Data represent two independent experiments, where the S.E. of the means are given. B, the kinase-negative Cdk9 protein (Cdk9D167N) inhibits the activation of transcription by the Rev·CycK hybrid protein. No or increasing concentrations of the kinase-negative Cdk9D167N proteins were co-expressed with the Rev·CycK chimera and pRRESCAT (lane 3, white bar; or lanes 4–8, black bars). CAT activities are presented as -fold activation relative to basal levels of pRRESCAT alone or pRRESCAT co-expressed with Rev (lanes 1 and 2, white bars). These data represent two independent experiments, where the S.E. of the means are given.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the ability of the specific P-TEFb complex that contains CycK and Cdk9 to activate transcription via DNA, we fused CycK to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (Gal). When co-expressed with the pG6CAT plasmid target with six Gal4 DNA binding sites (upstream-activating sequences), this chimera failed to activate transcription in 293T cells (Fig. 3, lane 3). Previously, we demonstrated that the full-length CycT1 but not mutant CycT1 proteins containing C-terminal deletions after position 590 could activate transcription via DNA (30.Taube R. Lin X. Irwin D. Fujinaga K. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As CycT1, CycT2, and CycK share the highly conserved N-terminal cyclin boxes, we examined whether these C-terminal extensions of CycT1 and CycT2 could confer upon CycK the ability to activate transcription via DNA. Indeed, when the Gal·CycK fusion protein was extended with the C-terminal domains of CycT1 from positions 301 to 726 (Gal·CycK·CycT1-(301–726)) and from positions 301 to 730 in CycT2 (Gal·CycK·CycT1-(301–730)), these tripartite chimeras activated transcription from pG6CAT equivalent to the chimeras between Gal and full-length CycT1, Gal·CycT1-(1–726) (Fig. 3,lanes 5, 7, and 10). Importantly, the fusion proteins between these C termini and Gal, lacking the cyclin boxes, had no effect in this assay (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 6). Additionally, when only the minimal C-terminal domain from positions 481 to 551 in CycT1 (CycT1-(481–551)), which contained the histidine-rich stretch was fused with the hybrid Gal·CycK protein, this Gal·CycK·CycT1-(481–551) fusion protein also activated transcription to levels similar to the Gal·CycK·CycT1-(301–726) chimera (Fig. 3, lane 9). Again, this fragment had no activity in the absence of the cyclin boxes (Fig. 3, lane 8). This result is in agreement with our previous study, where the histidine-rich stretch in the C-terminal domain of CycT1 bound the unphosphorylated CTD of RNAPII (30.Taube R. Lin X. Irwin D. Fujinaga K. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A structurally and functionally homologous sequence is also found in the C terminus of CycT2 from positions 550 to 590. We conclude that CycK lacks the binding site for RNAPII. When this sequence is provided, this P-TEFb complex can also activate transcription via DNA. To prove that the Gal·CycK fusion protein contains a CTD kinase activity, complexes of the Gal·CycK chimera and Cdk9 were purified by immunoprecipitation from 293T cells and assayed for their ability to phosphorylate the hybrid GST·CTD protein in vitro. Anti-Gal antibody was used for the immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, the complex between the hybrid Gal·CycK protein and Cdk9 could phosphorylate the GST·CTD fusion protein only from cells that expressed the chimera (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and2). We also determined the specificity of this CTD kinase using H14 and H5, two antibodies that recognize phosphorylated serine 2 and serine 5 in the heptapeptide repeats from the CTD, respectively. Indeed, the complex between the hybrid Gal·CycK protein and Cdk9 could phosphorylate both serines at positions 2 and 5 in the heptapeptide repeats of CTD (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and6). Thus, the complex between the Gal·CycK fusion protein and Cdk9 is an active CTD kinase, but it cannot activate transcription via DNA in vivo. To confirm that the CTD is required for transcriptional effects of Gal·CycK·CycT1-(301–726), Gal·CycK·CycT2-(301–730), and Gal·CycK·CycT1-(481–551) chimeras, we examined the activities of these fusion proteins in Raji cells, which expressed the α-amanitin-resistant wild-type RNAPII (52 heptapeptide repeats, HAwt) or the deletion mutant RNAPII protein that contained only 5 heptapeptide repeats (HAΔ5) (Fig. 5). Only cells that expressed HAwt supported the activity of our tripartite chimeras (Fig. 5, lanes 8, 9, and 10). In Raji cells where HAΔ5 was expressed, no activation was observed with any of our proteins in the presence of α-amanitin, which was added for the duration of the assay (Fig. 5, lanes 1–6, see “Experimental Procedures”). Taken together, these data indicate that the complex between CycK and Cdk9, similar to other P-TEFb complexes, requires the CTD of RNAPII for function. In this study, we have demonstrated that CycK forms an active P-TEFb complex with Cdk9 and promotes transcription via RNA in vivo. In sharp contrast, CycK could not activate transcription via DNA although it still functioned as a CTD kinase in vitro(14.Fu T.J. Peng J. Lee G. Price D.H. Flores O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34527-34530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because CycT1 and CycT2 can activate transcription via DNA and the histidine-rich stretch in CycT1 binds the CTD, the transcriptional activity of the hybrid Gal·CycK protein could be rescued by extending it with the C termini from CycT1 or CycT2. More importantly, the histidine-rich stretch from CycT1 alone could also rescue the activity of the Gal·CycK fusion protein via DNA. These extended tripartite fusion proteins required the CTD of RNAPII for activity. Thus, the C termini of these cyclin subunits from P-TEFb play important regulatory roles and dictate their substrate specificities. It is to be noted that our studies were performed in vivorather than in vitro. In in vitro transcription systems, P-TEFb is already present in the preinitiation complex, and the complex between CycK and Cdk9 functions via DNA (14.Fu T.J. Peng J. Lee G. Price D.H. Flores O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34527-34530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This finding could be due to very different stoichiometries of DNA templates and transcription complexes or compositions of nuclear extracts. Additionally, exogenously added, abundant P-TEFb could bind the CTD or RNAPII without the help of other proteins. Nevertheless, all other studies point to the obligatory recruitment of P-TEFb by RNA- or DNA-bound activators or their coactivators in cells. Thus, Tat, CIITA, NF-κB, androgen receptor, and c-Myc all recruit P-TEFb to the transcription complex (12.Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

Only then does P-TEFb interact with the CTD of RNAPII and N-TEF, leading to their phosphorylation (8.Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 9.Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12951-12958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This modification results in the transition from initiation to elongation of eukaryotic transcription. Importantly, CycK lacks this CTD-interacting domain. Because nascent RNA moves from the catalytic pocket in RNAPII along the CTD (35.Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), Cdk9 bound to CycK can still phosphorylate this substrate. DNA presentation is qualitatively different, where P-TEFb must first find and bind the CTD for Cdk9 to phosphorylate the RNAPII. The histidine-rich stretches in CycT1 and CycT2 perform this function. This finding explains why all three cyclins function via RNA, but only CycT1 and CycT2 can activate transcription via DNA. The theme of cyclins directing the activity of their associate kinases is not new. For example, the specificity of Cdk2 is governed by its associated cyclin A, especially by its hydrophobic MRAIL sequence, which is required for the binding and recognition of target proteins that contain the RXL motif (36.Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Likewise, CycK, CycT1, and CycT2 contain their highest sequence similarity in their cyclin boxes, where they bind Cdk9. Their C termini are very divergent. CycT1 and CycT2 share little besides the histidine-rich stretch, and only CycT1 possesses the TRM and PEST sequences (12.Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 13.Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Additionally, only the complex between CycT1 and Cdk9 can activate HIV-1 transcription (12.Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The TRM sequence is required for this function (12.Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated the PEST sequence in CycT1 is required for the interaction between CycT1 and SCF (SKP2), which then targets Cdk9 for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (37.Kiernan R.E. Emiliani S. Nakayama K. Castro A. Labbe J.C. Lorca T. Nakayama Ki K. Benkirane M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7956-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover this P-TEFb complex only phosphorylates CTD at serine 2 during HIV-1 transcription (38.Zhou M. Halanski M.A. Radonovich M.F. Kashanchi F. Peng J. Price D. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this study, the complex between CycK and Cdk9 could phosphorylate both serines 2 and 5. Thus, this P-TEFb might have a broader specificity. Supporting this notion, CycK was first associated with a CAK activity (23.Edwards M. Wong C. Elledge S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Other differences in the modes of action and target specificities of these different P-TEFb complexes will be revealed in future studies with many distinct activators and by following its genetic inactivation in the mouse. Our studies with CycK also suggest the tantalizing possibility that other cellular activators, i.e. Tat homologs, exist that function via RNA. They are expected to bind CycK and recruit this P-TEFb complex to positions downstream from the site of initiation of transcription. Indeed, a strategy using the yeast three-hybrid screening system to detect RNA-protein interactions identified 70 RNA sequences that functioned independently of an exogenous activation domain on their associated proteins (39.Sengupta D.J. Wickens M. Fields S. RNA. 1999; 5: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, these RNA sequences needed to be positioned near the promoter for their effects (39.Sengupta D.J. Wickens M. Fields S. RNA. 1999; 5: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is likely that these RNA species could fold into structures that directly recruited RNA-bound activators (39.Sengupta D.J. Wickens M. Fields S. RNA. 1999; 5: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Finally, CycK could also participate in cotranscriptional processing to maintain the hyperphosphorylated state of RNAPII before polyadenylation and maturation of primary transcripts. Such a cotranscriptional role for P-TEFb is also hinted at by recent studies, which suggest that some complexes between CycT1 and Cdk9 associate with 7SK RNA (40.Yang Z. Zhu Q. Luo K. Zhou Q. Nature. 2001; 414: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 41.Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O.

IL-6 binds to its cognate receptor, and the IL-6/IL-6R forms a complex with a gp130 homodimer. This receptor-ligand interaction activates Janus kinases (JAKs). JAKs phosphorylate the tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic tail of gp130, which then activates various members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family and also the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (2.Kishimoto T.

Therefore, it is believed that the limiting factor for the IL-6 effect is either the expression of functional cell surface IL-6R or the generation of functionally active sIL-6R. gp130 is ubiquitously expressed in different types of cells. IL-6R expression is also extensive on the surface of various cell types (6.Taga T. Ann. Med. 1997; 29: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,18.Thabard W. Barille S. Collette M.

Pedrazzoni M. Clin. Endocrinol. 1999; 51: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The sIL-6R can be generated by two distinct mechanisms as described for non-osteoblastic cells: by the shedding of the extracellular domain of IL-6R because of proteolytic cleavage, or by differential splicing (3.Rose-John S.

In the second case, a 94-base pair deletion occurs (exon 2), including the transmembrane coding region, creating a reading frameshift and resulting in the release of a soluble form of IL-6R carrying a unique 10-amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminus (3.Rose-John S.

Therefore, the two forms of sIL-6R can be distinguished by the characteristic COOH-terminal amino acid sequences. In this study we examined the synthesis and the cell surface expression of IL-6R and gp130 by human osteoblast-like cell lines (MG-63, HOS, and SaOS-2) and bone marrow-derived primary human osteoblasts. We also investigated the mechanism of sIL-6R generation and analyzed distinct functions of the cell surface IL-6R and the osteoblast-derived sIL-6R by monitoring the IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 in human osteoblasts. Human osteoblast-like cell lines MG-63, SaOS-2, and HOS and human monocytic cell line THP-1, a positive control for cell surface IL-6R expression (23.Jones S.A. Horiuchi S. Novick D. Yamamoto N.

Primary osteoblasts were isolated from bone marrow samples of either the iliac crest or vertebral bodies obtained during spine fusion surgeries from patients of both sexes, ranging in age from 25 to 69 years. Bone marrow collection was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and signed consent forms were obtained from each patient. Culture conditions, isolation, and characterization of cells were exactly the same as described earlier (43.Vermes C. Roebuck K.A. Chandrasekaran R. Dobai J.G. Jacobs J.J. Glant T.T. J. Bone Miner.

Briefly, buffy coat-separated nucleated bone marrow cells (2 × 107/T75 tissue culture flasks; Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS, 10 nm dexamethasone, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, all purchased from Sigma. The first medium change was performed on day 7, at which time the medium was supplemented with 5 μmβ-glycerophosphate (Sigma). Dense colonies of cells were trypsinized and 1 × 105 cells plated in 10-cm Petri dishes (Corning). Cells were then cultured to obtain a confluent monolayer culture. All experiments with bone marrow-derived osteoblasts were carried out using these first passage cultures. At the time of this first passage, aliquots of cells were also seeded in 24- and 96-well plates (Corning) for viability and cell proliferation tests, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity assays. AP activity was measured by Alkaline Phosphatase Colorimetric End point assay (Sigma) in cell lysates of first-passaged osteoblasts. Confluent cultures were stainedin situ for AP positivity using Naphthol-AX and Fast Blue reagents (Sigma) following the manufacture's instructions. Osteoblast cultures showing higher than 80–85% AP positivity were used in these experiments. Semiconfluent cultures of cells were subjected to serum starvation (0.3% FBS) for 24 h prior to treatment. Culture media were then replaced with fresh media containing 0.3% FBS and various compounds. Proliferation and viability assays, flow cytometry analysis, and total RNA and protein extractions were carried out on untreated and treated cells. Tissue culture media were collected at various time points, centrifuged, and stored at −80 °C. All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate in at least five independent experiments for osteoblast cell lines and in at least three independent experiments for primary osteoblasts. Reagents listed below were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), or Sigma. All concentrations were selected after serial dilutions of each compound tested in either MG-63 or primary osteoblast cell cultures. Only the viable range and the most effective concentrations were used for further experiments. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, 20 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/ml), sIL-6R (200 ng/ml), lipopolysaccharide (LPS, O127:B8, 1 mg/ml), phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 20 ng/ml), actinomycin D (an inhibitor of transcriptional events, 1 μg/ml), cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis, 10 μm), brefeldin A (an inhibitor of protein transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, 1 μm), monensin (an inhibitor of protein transport from Golgi, 10 μm), tunicamycin (an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, 2 μg/ml), wortmannin (an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), 0.1 μm), SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, 10 μm), UO126 (an inhibitor of MAPK kinase 1 and MAPK kinase 2 (MEK1 and MEK2), 1 μm), staurosporine (0.01 μm), calphostin C (0.1 μm), and bisindolylmaleimide I (1 μm) (all inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC)), genistein (an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK), 20 μm), H-89 (a potent inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), 30 μm), TAPI-1 (a hydroxamate-based metalloproteinase inhibitor, 50, 100, and 150 μm), and Galardin (GM-6001, a potent metalloproteinase inhibitor, 10, 50, and 100 μm) were added either alone or in different combinations. As calphostin C requires photoactivation (46.Bruns R.F. Miller F.D. Merriman R.L. Howbert J.J. Heath W.F. Kobayashi E. Takahashi I. Tamaoki T. Nakano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) to inhibit PKC, experiments with calphostin C were carried out in an incubator with a 5-watt light source located 15 cm above culture dishes. The trypan blue exclusion test was used to assess the viability of cells. Viability tests were performed in duplicate, and at least 200 cells were counted. Determination of cell viability was used to select the concentrations of each compound in which the cells remained viable (>95%), during the indicated time period. Cytokine concentrations in supernatants of osteoblast cultures were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in 96-well microtitration plates following the manufacturer's instructions. High sensitivity assay kits for IL-6 (sensitivity range from 3 to 200 pg/ml) and sIL-6R (range from 31 to 2000 pg/ml) were purchased from R&D Systems and BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA), respectively. Confluent layers of cells were either untreated or treated with different compounds for various times. Cells were harvested with enzyme-free cell dissociating buffer (Invitrogen) and then washed three times in washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma)). Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of washing buffer and incubated with 10 ng/μl mouse anti-human IL-6R monoclonal antibody (IgG1, clone B-R6, BIOSOURCE) or with 10 ng/μl mouse anti-human-gp130 monoclonal antibody (IgG2a, clone B-R3, BIOSOURCE) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by biotin-labeled polyclonal anti-mouse Ig antibody (10 ng/μl; BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). The reaction was developed with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Invitrogen). Samples were fixed in 2% formalin (Sigma) and then analyzed by FACScan (BD PharMingen) using Cell Quest software (BD PharMingen). Isotypic control antibodies corresponding to the primary antibodies were used to determine nonspecific background levels in all experiments. All compounds were tested for autofluorescence. Calphostin C- and bisindolylmaleimide I-treated cells exhibited red fluorescence necessitating the use of streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD PharMingen) in experiments whenever these two compounds were applied. Treated and untreated cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 unit/ml aprotinin), phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm KF, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and 0.01% NaN3 for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were ultrasonicated (Virtis, Gardina, NY) for 10 s at 4 °C and cleared by centrifugation, after which 700 μg of cell lysate protein was incubated with either 3 μg of anti-human-IL-6R antibody (rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or 3 μg of anti-human-gp130 antibody (rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected with Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) during an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Protein G-bound complexes were washed in lysis buffer, and then proteins of boiled samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in reducing condition as described (43.Vermes C.

Samples were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and the free binding capacity of the membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-human IL-6R (1 μg/ml), anti-human gp130 (1 μg/ml), or biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10, 1 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) antibodies. The reaction was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) after using appropriate second step reagents conjugated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled reagents (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). N-Glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was used to remove N-linked oligosaccharide chains from both IL-6R and gp130. The immunoprecipitated proteins were digested with N-glycosidase F according to the manufacturer's protocol and then analyzed using"

We show that tapasin interacts with β- and γ-subunits of COPI coatomer. COPI retrieves membrane proteins from the Golgi network back to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The COPI subunit-associated tapasin also interacts with MHC class I molecules suggesting that tapasin acts as the cargo receptor for packing MHC class I molecules as cargo proteins into COPI-coated vesicles. In tapasin mutant cells, neither TAP nor MHC class I are detected in association with the COPI coatomer. Interestingly, tapasin-associated MHC class I molecules are antigenic peptide-receptive and detected in both the ER and the Golgi.

It has been suggested that this process is required to induce the MHC class I conformation changes required for the loading of peptides (1Cresswell P. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) is an essential component of the loading complex, interacting directly with MHC class I (1Cresswell P. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol.

Science. 1994; 264: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The association of TAP with MHC class I is mediated by tapasin, a type-I transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic tail containing a double-lysine motif, which is known to retain resident proteins in the ER (4Li S.

Although tapasin is not involved in peptide translocation directly, it is a subunit of the TAP trimeric complex (4Li S. Sjogren H.O. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because peptide assembly is essential for the surface expression of MHC class I, it has been suggested that tapasin is involved in regulating the conformation of MHC class I molecules during peptide loading (10Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been reported that tapasin can stabilize the expression of TAP and increase the association of peptide with the TAP complex (11Bangia N. Lehner P.J. Hughes E.A. Surman M. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1858-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Li S. Paulsson K.M. Chen S. Sjogren H.O. Wang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1581-1586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Tapasin has also been suggested to retain empty class I molecules in the ER (13Schoenhals G.J.

Grandea 3rd, A.G. Spies T. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Fruh K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and transfection of the tapasin-deficient cell line 721.220 with H2-Kb resulted in increased transport of Kb to the cell surface compared with tapasin wild-type cells (14Barnden M.J. Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, studies using tapasin knockout mice have demonstrated that although MHC class I molecules are transported to the cell surface in tapasin-deficient cells a proportion of these molecules reach the cell surface without being loaded with high affinity peptides (8Grandea 3rd, A.G. Golovina T.N. Hamilton S.E. Sriram V. Spies T. Brutkiewicz R.R. Harty J.T. Eisenlohr L.C. Van Kaer L.

Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In the light of this, tapasin has been suggested to be one of the ER chaperones involved in MHC class I conformation during assembly (1Cresswell P. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Calnexin and calreticulin are ER chaperones with lectin-like activity. They bind to several glycoproteins in the ER other than MHC class I, and their association is regulated by the glucose trimming of nascent N-linked oligosaccharides (15Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 16Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). ERp57 shows both thiol-dependent reductase activity and cysteine protease activity toward various substrates (17Srivastava S.P. Chen N.Q. Liu Y.X. Holtzman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Otsu M. Urade R. Kito M. Omura F. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14958-14961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and MHC class I is one of the substrates. A direct interaction of ERp57 with calreticulin and calnexin has also been revealed, suggesting that these molecules may form a tricomplex. Such a complex could modulate glycoprotein folding within the ER lumen generally (19Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast to the ER chaperones, tapasin selectively associates with both MHC class I and TAP indicating that it has a more definite function in class I antigen presentation. Once a role of tapasin in the regulation of MHC class I processing had been established, it was questioned whether tapasin was an absolute requirement for MHC class I assembly. In subsequent studies, marked differences were noted between various MHC class I alleles in their assembly and antigen presentation in tapasin mutant cells (20Grandea 3rd, A.G. Lehner P.J. Cresswell P. Spies T. Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to TAP1 knockout mice, only a smaller part of the expressed MHC class I was found to be deficient in cells from tapasin knockout mice (8Grandea 3rd, A.G. Golovina T.N.

However, despite the observed deficiency in effective surface expression, MHC class I molecules could still present some antigenic peptides, resulting in a limited positive selection of CD8 T cells and in antipathogen immune responses (8Grandea 3rd, A.G. Golovina T.N. Hamilton S.E. Sriram V. Spies T. Brutkiewicz R.R. Harty J.T. Eisenlohr L.C. Van Kaer L. Immunity. 2000; 13: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that a point mutation of threonine 134 to lysine in HLA-A2.1 renders it incapable of interacting with tapasin, although high levels of the mutant HLA-A2.1 are expressed at the cell surface (22Lewis J.W. Neisig A. Neefjes J. Elliott T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Peace-Brewer A.L. Tussey L.G. Matsui M., Li, G. Quinn D.G. Frelinger J.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion of a tapasin-independent presentation pathway (24Androlewicz M.J. Immunol. Res. 1999; 20: 79-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, evidence for a role of tapasin in the optimization of peptide selection in MHC class I assembly has emerged from the study of profiles of MHC class I-associated peptides in tapasin mutant cells (25Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Burrows S.R. Talbo G.H. Laham N. Peh C.A. Reynolds E.C. Lopez De Castro J.A. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). HLA-B2705 has been found to be effective in presenting antigenic peptides and to be expressed on the cell surface of tapasin mutant cells (21Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Comparison of peptides bound to HLA-B2705 expressed in tapasin mutant cells with wild-type cells revealed an overall reduction in B2705-bound peptides, with only a limited difference in the peptide profiles (25Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Burrows S.R. Talbo G.H. Laham N. Peh C.A. Reynolds E.C. Lopez De Castro J.A. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the proportion of suboptimal peptides associated with B2705 in tapasin mutant cells is related to the delay found in the kinetics of B27-restricted antigen presentation (21Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J. Immunity. 1998; 8: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Similarly, an altered peptide repertoire in tapasin knockout mice was observed (9Garbi N. Tan P. Diehl A.D. Chambers B.J. Ljunggren H.G. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In tapasin knockout mice, MHC class I molecules exit the ER in an unstable form (8Grandea 3rd, A.G. Golovina T.N. Hamilton S.E. Sriram V. Spies T. Brutkiewicz R.R. Harty J.T. Eisenlohr L.C. Van Kaer L. Immunity. 2000; 13: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Taken as a whole, these results suggest that tapasin, although not required for assembly of MHC class I, provides a gating mechanism for reducing the expression of MHC class I molecules containing suboptimal peptides. In the present study, we show that tapasin may play a role the regulation of the retrograde transport of unstable MHC class I molecules from the Golgi complex to the ER. The observed interaction of tapasin with the COPI coatomer suggests that tapasin functions as a cargo receptor, mediating the packaging of MHC class I molecules in COPI-coated vesicles for transport from the Golgi complex to the ER in a retrograde fashion. We propose that unstable MHC class I molecules recycle between the ER and the Golgi complex until the loading of optimal peptides is completed. T1, T2, .220-HLA-A2, and .221-HLA-A2 cell lines were kindly provided by Drs. S. Kvist and T. Elliott, respectively. The cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Rabbit antiserum to human MHC class I (R425), which reacts to all forms of MHC class I molecules, was kindly provided by Dr. S. Kvist. The monoclonal antibody W6/32 specific to β2-microglobulin-associated human class I molecules was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Rabbit antisera against human TAP1 or tapasin were described previously (4Li S. Sjogren H.O. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anti-TGN46, a trans-Golgi marker, was obtained from Serotec. Antibodies to β− and γ-COPI and Sec13p-COPII were provided by Drs. C. Harter and W. Hong, respectively. The polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified before use. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 3% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Then, 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the incubation was continued for 60 min. At the end of labeling, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% digitonin (Sigma) or 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mg/ml iodoacetamide, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 30 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml pepstatin). The cleared lysates were added to antibodies previously bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). After washing, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as previously described (4Li S. Sjogren H.O. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8708-8713Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Western blotting and FACS analysis were performed as previously described (26Wang P. Raynoschek C. Svensson K. Ljunggren H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24830-24835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Quantification in immunoprecipitation and Western blotting was done using the Quantity One version 4.1.0 from Bio-Rad. Peptides were synthesized in a peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Model 431A), using conventional Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Peptides were subsequently purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and dissolved in PBS. The ε-amino group of lysine in HLA-A2-specific peptide of influenza-A matrix protein, M58–64G58YF62K (YILGKVFTL) was covalently modified by a photoreactive cross-linker as previously described (27Wang P. Gyllner G. Kvist S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot (1 μg) of the peptide was labeled by chloramine T-catalyzed iodination (125I). The modification and labeling experiments were performed in the dark. The cross-linker-modified and 125I-labeled peptides are referred to as 125I-MP-ANB-NOS. Microsomes from cell lines were prepared and purified according to Saraste et al. (28Saraste J. Palade G.E. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6425-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For photo-cross-linking, 125I-labeled and ANB-NOS-modified peptide was mixed with 20 μl of microsomes (absorbance of 60 A280/ml) to the final concentration of 100 nm, in RM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, 50 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgOAc2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). This mixture was then kept at 26 °C for 5 min. UV irradiation was subsequently carried out for 5 min on ice at 366 nm. Microsomal membranes were recovered by centrifugation through a 0.5 msucrose cushion in RM buffer containing 1 mm cold peptide (unlabeled peptide without ANB-NOS modification). The microsomal membranes were washed once with cold RM buffer, lysed by 1% digitonin, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Cross-linked microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antiserum. The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or quantitated using a γ counter. A modification of the method previously described (28Saraste J. Palade G.E. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6425-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) for fractionation of microsomal membranes was used. All steps were performed at 0–4 °C. Total microsomes (described above) were layered on top of 5 ml of 0.33 m sucrose containing 5 mm benzamidine, layered in turn on top of a sucrose cushion consisting of 1 ml of 2 m sucrose/5 mmbenzamidine. Centrifugation in an SW41 rotor for 60 min at 110,000 × g yielded a total microsome band on top of the cushion. The total microsome band was carefully collected. Then, 2 msucrose/5 mm benzamidine was slowly added to the microsomes to give a final concentration of 45% (w/v) sucrose. Microsomes were subfractionated by flotation using a modification of the method described previously (29Knipe D.M. Baltimore D. Lodish H.F. J. Virol. 1977; 21: 1128-1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μl of the total microsomes in 3 ml of 45% (w/v) sucrose was placed at the bottom of an SW41 ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with the following sucrose solutions: 1 ml of 30% and 1.9 ml each of 27.5%, 25%, 22.5%, and 20.0% (all solutions contained 5 mm benzamidine). After centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 h at 37,000 rpm (to reach isopyknic conditions), 25 fractions of 300 μl each were collected by upward displacement. .220A2 and .221A2 cells were prepared for immunoelectron microscopy as described previously (30Raposo G. Kleijmeer M.J. Posthuman G. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Weirs Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Science Inc., Malden, MA1997: 208Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 2% paraformaldehyde, and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were embedded in 10% gelatin, incubated for 4 h in 2.3 m sucrose at 4 °C, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were immunolabeled with tapasin antibody and 10 nm of protein A gold particles. To quantitate gold particles representing tapasin five times 5 × 200 gold particles were randomly counted at an instrumental magnification of 10,000×. Only gold particles within 20 nm of a membrane were counted. The background labeling on .220A2 cells was negligible. The exact role of tapasin in the regulation of MHC class I peptide loading has not yet been resolved. We anticipated that the double lysine motif at the C-terminal end of tapasin might be important for tapasin function. Proteins containing the characteristic KK XX retrieval motif interact with COPI-coatomers (31Harter C. Pavel J. Coccia F. Draken E. Wegehingel S. Tschochner H. Wieland F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which mediate retrograde transport from the Golgi complex back to the ER (32Harter C. Reinhard C. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 34: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the possible interaction between tapasin and COPI, microsomes from both the tapasin wild-type cell line 721.221 and the tapasin mutant cell line 720.220 were lysed and precipitated using the anti-tapasin antibody. The tapasin precipitates were analyzed further by Western blot with antibodies specific to COPI coatomer subunits. We found that anti-tapasin co-precipitated both β-COPI and γ-COPI coatomer subunits (Fig. 1). In addition, anti-tapasin also precipitated MHC class I and TAP, indicative of a functional association of COPI-coated vesicles with the MHC class I loading complexes (Fig. 1). The specific interaction of tapasin and the COPI coatomer was likewise confirmed by precipitation with anti-MHC class I and anti-TAP1 antisera. Similar amounts of MHC class I and TAP were precipitated by anti-MHC class I and anti-TAP1 antibodies, respectively, in both wild-type cells and tapasin mutant cells (Fig. 1). However, both antibodies were found to co-precipitate the COPI coatomer in wild-type cells only (Fig. 1). The specific interaction of tapasin and the COPI coatomer suggests that tapasin packs TAP and MHC class I into the COPI vesicles and mediates the retrograde transport of these molecules. There are two major types of coated vesicles, COPI and COPII, regulating intracellular transport of membrane proteins and secretory proteins (32Harter C. Reinhard C. Subcell. Biochem. 2000; 34: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the COPI-coated vesicles, the COPII-coated vesicles regulate the anterograde transport of newly synthesized proteins from the ER to the Golgi network (33Campbell J.L. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interaction of the COPII coatomer and tapasin was also examined, but no detectable association of tapasin with the COPII coatomer was found (data not shown). Tapasin was predicted to be an ER residential protein on the basis of its double lysine motif at the C terminus. The KK XX motif is one of the ER retrieval signals (34Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). To investigate the intracellular localization of tapasin, we performed immunoelectron microscopy on the .221A2 and .220A2 cells using the tapasin antiserum and 10 nm of protein A gold particles. Specific labeling for tapasin could be detected on membranes of the ER and the Golgi complex in the .221A2 cells. Semiquantitative analysis showed that 95% ± 2 of the total tapasin labeling was associated with ER membranes and 5% ± 2 with membranes in the Golgi area (Fig. 2). There was no specific tapasin staining in the .220A2 cells (data not shown). Because tapasin is an ER resident protein having a double lysine motif at the C terminus, the Golgi localization suggests that tapasin is retrieved from the Golgi back to the ER. In TAP mutant cells, though most of the MHC class I heavy chain and the β2m dimers are unstable and surface expression of MHC class I is deficient, it was found that similar amounts of MHC class I molecules could be detected in the trans-Golgi network compared with wild-type cells (35Baas E.J. van Santen H.M.

In the TAP mutant cells, tapasin could still associate with MHC class I molecules (36Paulsson K.M. Anderson P.O. Chen S. Sjogren H.O. Ljunggren H.G. Wang P. Li S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). If most of the class I molecules in the TAP mutant cells are unstable and tapasin facilitates the retrieval of unstable class I from the secretory pathway back to the ER, tapasin-associated class I molecules should accumulate in the ER of TAP mutant cells. To examine the off-rate of the MHC class I-tapasin complexes in the TAP mutant T2 cells, we performed pulse-chase experiments with T2 and T1 cells before precipitation with the anti-tapasin anti-serum. In T2 cells, the amount of tapasin-associated class I molecules is reduced compared with T1 cells (Fig. 3 A) (36Paulsson K.M. Anderson P.O. Chen S. Sjogren H.O. Ljunggren H.G. Wang P. Li S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Following the chase, class I molecules dissociated from tapasin in T1 cells but accumulated in T2 cells for more than 30 min before dissociation. The low off-rate of tapasin-associated MHC class I in the TAP mutant cells is due to a lack of optimal peptides for dissociating the class I molecules from tapasin. Analysis of tapasin and MHC class I molecules in subcellular fractionated microsomes showed that the amount of MHC class I and tapasin in the Golgi complex of .221A2 and T2 cells is similar (Fig. 4 A). The association of the tapasin-MHC class I complexes with the COPI coatomer was also demonstrated in T2 cells (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that in the absence of peptides, the tapasin-associated MHC class I molecules are not released but are instead recycled back to the ER.Figure 4Peptide-MHC class I binding assay of subfractionated microsomes from .221A2, T2, and .220A2 cells. Purified microsomes of .221A2, T2, and .220A2 cells were fractionated by sedimentation on sucrose gradients. A, 20 μl of each fraction was blotted with anti-p58 (an ER and cis-Golgi marker), anti-TGN46 (a trans-Golgi network marker), anti-MHC class I, anti-tapasin and anti-TAP1, respectively. The positions of detected molecules are indicated. B, identified ER and Golgi fractions of .221A2, T2, and .220A2 microsomes were permeabilized with 0.1% digitonin. The permeabilized microsomes were mixed with cross-linker-modified HLA-A2 binding peptide MP. After cross-linking, microsomes were lysed and precipitated with anti-tapasin antiserum. Position of cross-linked MHC class I is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When tapasin retrieval unloads class I molecules from the trans-Golgi network back to the ER, the tapasin-associated MHC class I molecules in the Golgi should potentially be receptive molecules for optimal peptides. To examine this in more detail, microsomes of .220A2, .221A2, and T2 cells were fractionated in ER and trans-Golgi fractions as shown in Fig. 4 A. The fractionated microsomes were permeabilized with 0.1% digitonin and incubated with the 125I-labeled and cross-linker-modified HLA-A2 binding peptide MP. After incubation, the digitonin lysates were precipitated with anti-tapasin antiserum. If the tapasin-associated class I molecules are peptide-receptive, they will be cross-linked with reporter peptides. A significant amount of tapasin-associated class I molecules were shown to be bound to the reporter peptides in both the Golgi and ER fractions of the .221A2 and T2 cells (Fig. 4 B). This indicates that tapasin-associated class I molecules in the Golgi network are indeed peptide-receptive and suggests that they are transported back to the ER in a retrograde manner for the assembly of optimal peptides. Studies of TAP mutant cells showed that assembly of MHC class I molecules with peptides in the ER is essential for their surface expression (35Baas E.J. van Santen H.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Geuze H.J. Peters P.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It was suggested that peptide loading in the ER and the subsequent export of mature MHC class I from the ER to the Golgi network is a rapid process (37Solheim J.C. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recent reports of studies on intracellular trafficking, however, have revealed a complex process of MHC class I assembly and exit from the ER (2Marguet D. Spiliotis E.T. Pentcheva T. Lebowitz M. Schneck J. Edidin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 231-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 38Spiliotis E.T. Osorio M. Zuniga M.C. Edidin M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). MHC class I assembly is mediated by the interaction of MHC class I with the TAP complex and with other ER chaperones (10Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The MHC class I-TAP interaction is mediated by tapasin, a type I transmembrane protein with a double lysine motif as a retrieval signal at its C terminus (4Li S. Sjogren H.O. Hellman U. Pettersson R.F. Wang P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8708-8713Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although tapasin has been suggested to facilitate MHC class I assembly in the ER (5Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampe R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), there is still no clear evidence for a direct involvement of tapasin in peptide loading. Despite a quantitative defect in class I antigen presentation in tapasin mutant cell lines and in the cells of tapasin knockout mice (6Grandea 3rd, A.G. Androlewicz M.J. Athwal R.S. Geraghty D.E. Spies T. Science. 1995; 270: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 8Grandea 3rd, A.G. Golovina T.N. Hamilton S.E. Sriram V. Spies T. Brutkiewicz R.R. Harty J.T. Eisenlohr L.C. Van Kaer L. Immunity. 2000; 13: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), findings concerning the role of tapasin directly in class I assembly are not compelling (14Barnden M.J. Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Peh C.A. Burrows S.R. Barnden M. Khanna R. Cresswell P. Moss D.J. McCluskey J.

Immunogenetics. 2000; 52: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Using cross-linker-modified reporter peptides, we could not detect any significant defect in peptide binding to class I in tapasin mutant cells (12Li S. Paulsson K.M. Chen S. Sjogren H.O. Wang P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1581-1586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This suggests that tapasin indirectly regulates the quality of the class I expression but not the catalytic step in the assembly between MHC class I and peptides. Immunoelectron microscopy showed tapasin to be distributed in both the Golgi network and the ER, suggesting a retrograde transport of tapasin and tapasin-associated MHC class I molecules from the Golgi network back to the ER. Compelling support for this model is provided by the discovery of a direct interaction of tapasin with the COPI coatomer. The COPI coatomer consists of seven COPI subunits preassembled in the cytosol to form a complex called the coatomer (40Kreis T.E. Lowe M. Pepperkok R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 677-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The function of the coatomer is to drive the formation of retrograde transport vesicles responsible for the retrieval of ER resident proteins from the Golgi complex (41Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 42Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The association of tapasin with COPI-interacting MHC class I molecules demonstrates a novel function of tapasin in mediating the packing of MHC class I molecules into the COPI vesicles as cargo proteins. Peptide loading experiments demonstrated that the tapasin-associated MHC class I molecules in the Golgi are indeed peptide-receptive molecules that are to be loaded with optimal peptides. Together with the finding that tapasin is indeed located on Golgi membranes, these data suggest that tapasin-mediated COPI vesicle transport provides a control mechanism for retrieval of unstable MHC class I molecules back to the ER. In tapasin mutant cells MHC class I can exit from the ER, although a proportion of exported class I molecules are unstable and rapidly degraded (8Grandea 3rd, A.G. Golovina T.N. Hamilton S.E. Sriram V. Spies T. Brutkiewicz R.R. Harty J.T. Eisenlohr L.C. Van Kaer L. Immunity. 2000; 13: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Garbi N. Tan P. Diehl A.D.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The lack of association of class I with the retrograde transport vesicles in tapasin mutant cells could very well be a reason for the expression of unstable MHC class I molecules in these cells. In TAP mutant cells, peptide-receptive class I molecules also exit from the ER but with a severe deficiency in their surface expression. This suggests that there is an intact retrograde transport pathway mediated by tapasin-associated COPI vesicles for recycling peptide-receptive class I molecules back to the ER. Compelling support for the control of optimized MHC class I expression by tapasin has been provided by the analysis of peptide loading-profiles in tapasin mutant cells (25Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Burrows S.R. Talbo G.H. Laham N. Peh C.A. Reynolds E.C. Lopez De Castro J.A. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In that study, the total amount of recoverable class I-associated peptides was found to be reduced in tapasin mutant cells (25Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Burrows S.R. Talbo G.H. Laham N. Peh C.A. Reynolds E.C. Lopez De Castro J.A. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, despite overlap of the peptide profiles eluted from MHC class I molecules in tapasin mutant and wild-type cells, subsets of peptides have been recovered exclusively from wild-type cells, and a few peptides were eluted only from MHC class I molecules of tapasin mutant cells, suggestive of changes in the peptide repertoire occurring during the process of optimized addition of peptides (25Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Burrows S.R. Talbo G.H. Laham N. Peh C.A. Reynolds E.C. Lopez De Castro J.A. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because every MHC class I allele can assemble with a diverse set of peptides of restricted length and hydrophobic C termini, tapasin is unlikely to specifically chaperone each class I allele for the loading of specific sets of peptides. The change of suboptimal to optimal peptides may be due largely to the competition of high affinity peptides with preloaded low affinity peptides in the ER. A long retention time for TAP-dissociated MHC class I in the secretory pathway has been demonstrated (2Marguet D. Spiliotis E.T. Pentcheva T. Lebowitz M. Schneck J. Edidin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 231-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and H2Kb molecules retained intracellularly are loaded with new peptides up to 3 h after synthesis (43Sijts A.J. Pamer E.G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1403-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that tapasin-associated MHC class I molecules from both the Golgi and the ER are peptide-receptive molecules, suggesting that these class I molecules can be either unloaded or loaded with suboptimal peptides. The tapasin-associated MHC class I can be dissociated with high affinity peptides (36Paulsson K.M. Anderson P.O. Chen S. Sjogren H.O. Ljunggren H.G. Wang P. Li S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The interaction of tapasin with COPI-coated vesicles, retains unloaded or suboptimally loaded MHC class I in the ER for the refined loading with high affinity peptides as suggested in Fig. 5. Moreover, it has been shown that both high and low affinity peptides could be eluted from the class I molecules present in tapasin mutant cells. This suggests that tapasin is not a prerequisite for loading of high affinity peptides. In addition to the association of the tapasin-class I complex with the COPI-coated vesicles, an accumulation of class I-tapasin complexes in TAP mutant cells following a chase time was revealed (Fig. 3 A). This points to recycling of the tapasin-associated class I molecules in the secretory pathway when peptides are absent, a result consistent with the earlier observation that class I molecules can exit from the ER in TAP mutant cells in an unstable form but cannot be expressed on the cell surface (35Baas E.J. van Santen H.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Geuze H.J. Peters P.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Day P.M. Esquivel F. Lukszo J. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Immunity. 1995; 2: 137-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A and B). Apart from the association of tapasin with MHC class I and COPI coatomer subunits, TAP was also detected in the COPI coatomer complex, indicative of a retrograde transport of unstable MHC class I molecules associated with a peptide transporter leading to increased chances for MHC class I to assemble with optimal peptides. It has been found that COPI-coated vesicles mediate both the anterograde transport of secretory proteins between the Golgi stacks and the retrograde transport of ER resident proteins from the Golgi back to the ER (42Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In a recent report, evidence from a study of green fluorescence protein-tagged class I molecules suggests a selective export of class I molecules from the ER to the Golgi by the COPII transport vesicles (38Spiliotis E.T. Osorio M. Zuniga M.C. Edidin M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Whether tapasin-associated COPI vesicles mediate bi-directional transport of unstable MHC class I molecules from the Golgi to the ER and of properly loaded MHC class I molecules from within the Golgi network remains to be investigated. Although there is no correlation between tapasin dependence and either the expression of HLA-B2705 or affinity for B2705 (25Purcell A.W. Gorman J.J. Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Burrows S.R. Talbo G.H. Laham N. Peh C.A. Reynolds E.C. Lopez De Castro J.A. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1016-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the differential association of various MHC class I alleles with tapasin and their differences in tapasin-dependent presentation suggest that tapasin may differentially regulate class I molecules (45Lewis J.W. Sewell A. Price D. Elliott T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This may possibly be a result of the differences both in the diversity of the loadable peptides and in the stability of the various alleles after loading (46Neisig A. Wubbolts R. Zang X. Melief C. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3196-3206PubMed Google Scholar). Association with tapasin may chaperone the suboptimal MHC class I molecules until they are stabilized by optimal peptides. Membrane-free tapasin can thus increase the stable expression of class I molecules at the surface of tapasin mutant cells (47Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The findings presented in this study not only reveal a novel function of tapasin in antigen presentation but, together with the finding of vesicle-mediated export of class I molecules (38Spiliotis E.T. Osorio M. Zuniga M.C. Edidin M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), also reveal co-evolution of antigen presentation and the general cell biological mechanisms of intracellular protein transport. Future studies will clarify the role of tapasin-dependent antigen presentation in the selection of optimal peptides for the stable expression of MHC class I alleles. We thank Drs. S. Kvist, R.

In considering the interactions between viral proteins and tRNALys during tRNA incorporation into viruses, it must be taken into account that tRNAs, like most other RNAs, are bound to proteins in the cytoplasm (3Stapulionis R. Deutscher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7158-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A major tRNA-binding protein in the cytoplasm is the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, the protein responsible for tRNA aminoacylation. Since all three tRNALys isoacceptors are packaged into HIV-1, the viral proteins might first interact with a tRNALys/lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) complex during the packaging of tRNALys into the virion. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV-1 containing an inactive viral protease lysyl-tRNA synthetase reverse transcriptase HIV-1 precursor protein containing sequences coding for HIV-1 structural proteins HIV-1 precursor protein containing sequences coding for retroviral structural proteins and retroviral enzymes human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV-1 containing an inactive viral protease lysyl-tRNA synthetase reverse transcriptase HIV-1 precursor protein containing sequences coding for HIV-1 structural proteins HIV-1 precursor protein containing sequences coding for retroviral structural proteins and retroviral enzymes As described previously, LysRS is selectively packaged into HIV-1 (4Cen S.

During HIV-1 assembly (see Ref. 5Swanstrom R. Wills J.W. Coffin J. Hughes S. Varmus H. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 263-334Google Scholar for review), the major structural precursor protein, Gag, is assembled at the plasma membrane. Also, part of the assembly complex is viral genomic RNA and another precursor protein, Gag-Pol, which contains the sequences for the viral enzymes, protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase. During or after budding of the virion from the cell, the viral protease converts these precursor proteins to the processed proteins found in the mature virion. However, the incorporation of tRNALys occurs independently of both precursor protein processing and genomic RNA packaging (6Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.-L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gag alone is sufficient to produce extracellular Gag particles, and LysRS is packaged into these particles (4Cen S. Khorchid A.

The recognition and binding of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases with their cognate tRNAs involve interactions with the acceptor stem and, in most cases, the anticodon arms of the tRNAs (11Giege R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Based on studies of the human tRNALys3/human LysRS interaction, the anticodon of tRNALys3 plays an important role in LysRS recognition and binding (12Stello T. Hong M. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, the enzyme is relatively insensitive to mutations in the acceptor stem domain both in vivo (13Shiba K. Stello T. Motegi H. Noda T. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22809-22816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in vitro (12Stello T. Hong M. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another recent report indicated that the N-terminal domain of hamster LysRS, which is adjacent to the anticodon binding domain, although not essential for aminoacylation, improves the docking of the acceptor arm of tRNALys3 into the active site of the enzyme (14Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Previous work has indicated that a certain variability in the anticodon sequence is tolerated for tRNALys packaging into virions,i.e. not only do tRNALys3 (anticodon SUU, where S = mcm5S2U) 2S = hypermodified nucleotide at tRNALys3 U34 = mcm5S2U. 2S = hypermodified nucleotide at tRNALys3 U34 = mcm5S2U.and tRNALys1,2 (anticodon CUU) appear to be packaged with equal efficiency, but a mutant tRNALys3 with a CUA anticodon is packaged, although aminoacylated to only 40% of wild-type levels in vivo (15Huang Y. Shalom A., Li, Z. Wang J. Mak J. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4700-4706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutations at U35 have been shown to have a more severe effect on aminoacylation catalytic efficiency in vitro (12Stello T. Hong M. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Tamura K. Himeno H. Asahara H. Hasegawa T. Shimizu M.

In this report, we constructed different tRNALys3genes mutated at position U35 as well as at other anticodon positions, and we expressed these genes in COS7 cells also transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA. We show that the anticodon is indeed a major determinant for tRNALys3 packaging. Moreover, the ability of mutant tRNALys3 molecules to be aminoacylated in vivo correlates directly with their ability to be packaged into HIV-1. SVC21.BH10, a simian virus 40-based vector containing wild-type HIV-1 proviral DNA, was a gift of E. Cohen, University of Montreal. SVC12.BH10Lys3 UUU contains the HIV-1 proviral DNA plus a wild-type tRNALys3 gene with the anticodon DNA sequence TTT. SVC12.BH10Lys3CGA, SVC12.BH10Lys3CGU, SVC12.BH10Lys3SGU, and SVC12.BH10Lys3SGA contain the HIV-1 proviral DNA plus a mutant tRNALys3 gene where the anticodon DNA sequence has been changed from TTT to CGA, CGT, TGT, and TGA, respectively. Mutant tRNALys3 genes were created by PCR mutagenesis (11Giege R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The amplified products were cloned into the Hpa-I site of SVC21.BH10, which is upstream of the HIV-1 proviral DNA sequence. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfection of COS7 cells with the above plasmids by the calcium phosphate method was as described previously (6Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.-L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viruses were isolated from COS7 cell culture medium 63 h posttransfection or from the cell culture medium of infected cell lines. The virus-containing medium was first centrifuged in a Beckman GS-6R rotor at 3,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was then filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. The viruses in the filtrate were then pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman Ti45 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 1 h. The viral pellet was purified by centrifugation with a Beckman SW41 rotor at 26,500 rpm for 1 h through 15% sucrose onto a 65% sucrose cushion. Total cellular or viral RNA was extracted from cell or viral pellets by the guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar) and dissolved in 5 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. Dot-blots of cellular or viral RNA were hybridized with DNA probes complementary to tRNALys3 and tRNALys1,2 (1Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), genomic RNA (18Cen S. Huang Y. Khorchid A. Darlix J.L. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4485-4488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and β-actin mRNA (DNA probe from Ambion). Two-dimensional PAGE of [32P]Cp 3′-end-labeled viral RNA was carried out as described previously (1Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the total amount of tRNALys3 (combined wild type and mutant) present in cellular or viral RNA, we used an 18-mer DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′ 18 nucleotides of tRNALys3(5′-TGGCGCCCGAACAGGGAC-3′). Previously, this probe has been shown to hybridize specifically with tRNALys3 (14Francin M. Kaminska M. Kerjan P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1762-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and was hybridized to Dot-blots on Hybond N (Amersham Biosciences) containing known amounts of purified in vitro transcript of tRNALys3 and either cellular tRNA or viral RNA produced in cells transfected with either SVC21.BH10 alone or SVC21.BH10 containing a wild-type or mutant tRNALys3 gene. The DNA oligomer was first 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mMol, Dupont Canada), and specific activities of from 108 to 109 cpm/μg were generally reached. Approximately 107 cpm of oligomer was used per blot in hybridization reactions. For detection of specific wild-type or mutant tRNALys3, DNA probes complementary to the anticodon arm were used (see Fig. 1): wild-type tRNA SUULys3, (5′-CCCTCAGATTAAAAGTCTGATGC-3′); tRNA CGALys3, (5′- CCCTCAGATTTCGAGTCTGATGC-3′); tRNA CGULys3, (5′-CCCTCAGATTACGAGTCTGATGC-3′); tRNA SCULys3, (5′-CCCTCAGATTACAAGTCTGATGC-3′); tRNA SCALys3, (5′-CCCTCAGATTTCAAGTCTGATGC-3′). To specifically detect the presence of tRNALys3 mutants in RNA samples, blots were hybridized with 5′-32P-end-labeled anticodon probes to the tRNALys3 mutants in the presence of an 8–25-fold excess of non-radioactive oligonucleotide complementary to the wild-type tRNALys3 anticodon arm. To measure the extent of in vivo aminoacylation of tRNALys3, the isolation of cellular or viral RNA was performed using acidic conditions required for stabilizing the aminoacyl-tRNA bond described previously (19Ho Y.S. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2185-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24712-24718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the extent of in vivo aminoacylation of tRNALys3, the isolation of cellular or viral RNA was performed at low pH conditions required for stabilizing the aminoacyl-tRNA bond. The guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure for isolating RNA was modified by including 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, in solution D, and the phenol used was equilibrated in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The final isopropanol-precipitated RNA pellet was dissolved in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0, and stored at −70 °C until electrophoretic analysis. RNA was mixed with one volume loading buffer (0.1m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 8 m urea, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol) and electrophoresed in a 0.5-mm thick polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The running buffer was 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and electrophoresis was carried out at 300 V for 15–18 h at 4 °C in a Hoefer SE620 electrophoretic apparatus. RNA was electroblotted onto Hybond N filter paper (AmershamBiosciences) using an electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 750 mA for 15 min. using 1× TBE buffer (0.09 m Tris borate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA). Hybridization of the blots with probes for wild-type and mutant tRNALys3 was performed as described above. Deacylated tRNA was produced by treating the RNA sample with 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, at 37 °C for 3 h to hydrolyze the aminoacyl linkage and provide an uncharged electrophoretic marker. Western blot analysis was performed using 300 μg of cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins as determined by the Bradford assay (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochemistry. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Gelman Sciences). Detection of the nuclear transcription factor YY1 on the Western blot utilized monoclonal antibodies to YY1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western blots were analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences) using anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) as a secondary antibody. The sizes of the detected protein bands were estimated using prestained high molecular weight protein markers (Invitrogen). The cytoplasmic supernatant and nuclear extract were prepared from the COS7 cells as described previously (22Ko Y.-G. Kang Y.-S. Kim E.-K. Park S. Kim S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 149: 567-574Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as above using anti-YY1. The anticodon is a major determinant for aminoacylation of human tRNALys3 by human LysRS (12Stello T. Hong M. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The ability of tRNALys3 to be aminoacylated in vitro was shown to be particularly sensitive to changes at anticodon position U35 (12Stello T. Hong M. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether a correlation exists between the ability of tRNALys3 to be aminoacylated and incorporated into HIV-1, we have transfected COS7 cells with a plasmid containing both HIV-1 proviral DNA and a wild-type or mutant tRNALys3 gene. As shown previously, this results in more tRNALys3 being synthesized in the cytoplasm, and in the case of wild-type tRNALys3 and tRNALys3variants examined to date, increased viral packaging has also been observed (23Huang Y. Mak J. Cao Q., Li, Z. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7676-7683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these previously tested tRNAs did not contain changes at U35. Because the middle anticodon position is critical for aminoacylation, the different tRNALys3 variants examined in this work all contained a U35G mutation in addition to other possible anticodon mutations such as S34C or U36A (Fig. 1). We have measured the ability of mutant tRNALys3 to be incorporated into virions using two different hybridization probes, which are shown in Fig. 1. We have measured changes in total tRNALys3 packaged into virions (Fig. 2) using a hybridization probe complementary to the 3′-terminal 18 nucleotides of tRNALys3, which detects both wild-type and mutant tRNALys3. We have also monitored the incorporation into virions of specific mutant tRNALys3 using hybridization probes complementary to the anticodon arm, i.e. probes that are specific for each mutant tRNALys3 (see Fig. 4). As shown below, both types of probes yield similar conclusions, and both probes were used (see Fig. 6) to measure aminoacylation of either total tRNALys3 or of specific wild-type or mutant tRNALys3.Figure 4Expression of specific wild-type and mutant tRNALys3 in cells and viruses. COS7 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing HIV-1 proviral DNA and a wild-type or mutant tRNALys3 gene. For each strip in panel A, the left portion contains Dot-blots of increasing amounts of an in vitro wild-type or mutant tRNALys3 transcript used to determine differences in efficiencies of hybridization for different anticodon probes. The right portion contains Dot-blots of cellular or viral RNA containing equal amounts of either β-actin mRNA (cellular RNA) or genomic RNA (viral RNA), which were hybridized with a DNA probe complementary to the anticodon arm of each wild-type and mutant tRNALys3, as shown in Fig. 1. The control in the bottom four strips is the wild-type tRNALys3 in vitro transcript, and it shows that the anticodon probes do not detect wild-type tRNALys3. The letters to the left of the strips represent the anticodon sequence of the tRNALys3 detected. In the SUU strip, cells were transfected with HIV-1 DNA alone (BH10, also labeled as none in panels B and C) or with HIV-1 DNA plus a wild-type tRNALys3 gene and then probed with a DNA probe complementary to anticodon arm of wild-type tRNALys3. The normalized results are plotted in panel B (cellular) and in panel C (viral).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Electrophoretic detection of acylated and deacylated tRNALys3. Cellular RNA was isolated, and fractions containing equal concentrations of β-actin mRNA were electrophoresed under acidic conditions as described under “Results.” Northern blots of the cellular RNA were hybridized with either the 3′-terminal DNA probe, which hybridizes to all forms of tRNALys3 (A), or with anticodon probes specific for each mutant tRNALys3 (B–E). The first lane in each panel (lanes 1, 8,11, 14, and 17) represents cellular RNA that was first exposed to alkaline pH to deacylate the tRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Panel A, lane 3 represents cells transfected with HIV-1 DNA alone (BH10, also referred to as none in panel F). Lanes 2 and lanes 4–7 represents cells transfected with HIV-1 DNA and tRNALys3 genes coding for the following tRNA anticodon sequence: 2, SUU; 4, SGA; 5, SGU;6, CGU; 7, CGA. In panels B–E, the middle lanes (lanes 9, 12,15, 18) represent the RNA from cells transfected with HIV-1 DNA and tRNALys3 genes coding for the following tRNA anticodon sequences: B, SGA; C, SGU;D, CGU; E, CGA. The last lanes in each of these panels (lanes 10, 13, 16, and 19) represent RNA extracted from cells transfected only with HIV-1 proviral DNA. The percentage of aminoacylation, as determined from lanes 2 and 3 in panel A and the middle lanes in panels B–E, is shown in panel F.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data in Fig. 2 show both the expression of total (wild-type and mutant) tRNALys3 in the cytoplasm of the transfected COS7 cells and their incorporation into HIV-1. Fig. 2 A shows Dot-blots of cellular or viral RNA hybridized with a radioactive 18-nucleotide DNA oligomer complementary to the 3′-terminal 18 nucleotides of tRNALys3. The top strip represents increasing amounts of synthetic tRNALys3, and the hybridization results are plotted as a standard curve in Fig. 2 B. The bottom two strips in Fig. 2 A show Dot-blots of RNA isolated from either cell lysates containing equal amounts of β-actin mRNA (cell) or viral lysates containing equal amounts of viral genomic RNA (viral). Dot-blots for determining β-actin mRNA and genomic RNA amounts are not shown. The relative total tRNALys3/β-actin mRNA ratios are plotted in Fig. 2 C, normalized to the value obtained in COS7 cells transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA alone (BH10). Transfection with the wild-type tRNALys3 gene or the mutant tRNALys3genes results in an approximately 2-fold increase in the cytoplasmic concentration of total tRNALys3. However, as shown in Fig. 2 D, these cytoplasmic increases in tRNALys3 did not all result in increases in tRNALys3 incorporation into virions. The maximum increase in tRNALys3 incorporation into virions occurred with excess wild-type tRNA SUULys3 (1.85-fold). tRNA SGULys3 and tRNA CGULys3 increased packaging 1.4- and 1.3-fold, respectively. tRNA CGALys3showed no increase in tRNALys3 incorporation, and tRNA SGALys3 actually showed a small decrease in packaging as compared with wild-type tRNA SUULys3. The changes in tRNALys3 incorporation into virions upon transfection with plasmids encoding wild-type tRNALys3 or anticodon variants were also visualized by two-dimensional PAGE. Fig. 3 A shows the electrophoresis pattern of low molecular weight viral RNA in wild-type virions. Previously, we have identified spot 3 as tRNALys3 and spots 1 and 2 as belonging to the tRNALys1,2 isoacceptor family (1Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of COS7 cells with a plasmid containing both the wild-type tRNALys3 gene and HIV-1 proviral DNA results in virions containing an increase in tRNALys3 and a decrease in tRNALys1,2 (Fig. 3 B). Similar observations were reported previously (23Huang Y. Mak J. Cao Q., Li, Z. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7676-7683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When COS7 cells are transfected with HIV-1 DNA and either tRNA SGULys3 or tRNA CGULys3, which have an intermediate ability to be packaged into virions (Fig. 2 D), the two-dimensional PAGE patterns show an increased ratio of tRNALys3/tRNALys1,2 in the virions (Fig. 3,panels C and D). On the other hand, tRNA SGALys3 and tRNA CGALys3, which the data indicate are not packaged into virions (Fig. 2 D), do not show a significant change in the tRNALys3/tRNALys1,2ratio relative to the wild-type control (Fig. 3, panels E and F). The tRNALys3/tRNALys1,2ratios, determined by phosphorimaging, are listed beneath each panel. Taken together, the data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 show that the ability of tRNALys3 anticodon variants to be packaged into HIV is directly correlated with the tRNALys3/tRNALys1,2 ratio. The experiments in Figs. 2 and 3 measure total tRNALys3(wild-type and mutant) in the cytoplasm and in the virion. We have also used hybridization probes specific for each tRNALys3anticodon mutant to examine their specific expression in the cytoplasm and incorporation into virions. The Dot-blots shown in Fig. 4 A measure the amount of a specific tRNALys3 variant isolated from cell or viral lysates containing equal amounts of β-actin mRNA or genomic RNA, respectively. The top strip in panel A (SUU) shows the amounts of tRNALys3 in cytoplasm and viruses from cells either transfected with HIV-1 alone (BH10) or transfected with HIV-1 and a wild-type tRNALys3 gene (BH10Lys3). The remaining four strips in panel A show the amount of tRNALys3 in cytoplasm and viruses from cells transfected with HIV-1 and different mutant tRNALys3 genes whose anticodon sequence is listed to the left of the strip. In each of these strips, the wild-type tRNALys3 transcript was used as a control to show that the mutant anticodon probes are not detecting wild-type tRNALys3. For each tRNA, a standard hybridization curve was generated and used to calculate the amount (nanograms) present in cell lysate or virus, thereby taking into account any differences in efficiencies of hybridization between the probes. The relative tRNALys3/β-actin mRNA ratios are plotted in Fig. 4 B, normalized to the value found for cells transfected with HIV-1 alone (BH10). The results are very similar to those shown in Fig. 2 using a DNA hybridization probe that measures total tRNALys3. Wild-type tRNALys3 expression is increased significantly when cells are transfected with a wild-type tRNALys3 gene. The expression of each mutant tRNALys3 in the cytoplasm is similar and results in an approximately 2-fold increase in total tRNALys3 (endogenous wild type and mutant) when probed with an oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′-end of tRNALys3 (Fig. 2 C). The tRNALys3/genomic RNA ratios in virions are shown in Fig. 4 C, normalized to the value found for cells transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA alone (BH10). The results with wild-type tRNA SUULys3 also match the results shown in Fig. 2 D. The incorporation of this tRNA into virions increased the tRNALys3/genomic RNA ratio to 1.87, indicating a relative incorporation of exogenous tRNALys3as compared with endogenous tRNALys3 of 0.87. In contrast, the relative incorporation of tRNA SGULys3 and tRNA CGULys3 was only 0.50 and 0.37, respectively, whereas tRNA CGALys3 and tRNA SGALys3 showed relative incorporations of 0.013 and 0.029 (Fig. 4 C). The data in Fig. 4 indicate that while wild-type or mutant tRNALys3 is expressed at approximately equal levels in the total cell lysate, they are incorporated into virions to variable extents. One explanation could be that some mutant forms of tRNALys3 are not exported out of the nucleus with equal efficiency. To test this possibility, we lysed cells and separated nuclei from cytoplasm by low speed centrifugation. A radioactive DNA probe complementary to the 3′-terminal 18 nucleotides present in all forms of tRNALys3 studied here was hybridized to Northern blots containing both increasing amounts of an in vitro tRNALys3 transcript (Fig. 5,left side of panel A) and cytoplasmic RNA samples that contain equal amounts of β-actin mRNA (Fig. 5, right side of panel A). The standard curve generated on the left side of panel A shows that the cytoplasmic tRNALys3 hybridization signals obtained are within the linear range of the standard curve. The relative total cytoplasmic tRNALys3/β-actin mRNA obtained from these Northern blot hybridizations is shown graphically in Fig. 5 B. These experiments indicate that both wild-type and tRNALys3variants are expressed at approximately equal amounts in the cytoplasm, consistent with the data shown in Figs. 2 and 4. To ensure that effective separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was achieved in our experiments, we demonstrated that the transcription factor YY1, which concentrates in the nucleus, is only detected in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 5 C). We next determined the aminoacylation state of the wild-type and mutant forms of tRNALys3 examined here. The electrophoretic mobility of acylated tRNA in acid-urea PAGE is reduced relative to the deacylated form, and this property can be used to determine the extent of tRNA aminoacylation (23Huang Y. Mak J. Cao Q., Li, Z. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7676-7683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows Northern blots of cellular and viral RNA samples electrophoresed in acid-urea gels, blotted onto Hybond N filter paper, and hybridized with radioactive DNA probes specific for tRNALys3. In panel A, cellular tRNA was hybridized with the 18-nucleotide DNA oligomer complementary to the 3′-18 nucleotides of tRNALys3, whereas in panels B–E, the cellular tRNA was hybridized with the anticodon probes specific for different tRNALys3 mutants. Lane 1 in panel A shows the mobility of wild-type tRNALys3 deacylated in vitro at alkaline pH. As reported previously (23Huang Y. Mak J. Cao Q., Li, Z. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7676-7683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in cells either transfected with the wild-type tRNALys3 gene (lane 2) or not transfected with any tRNALys3 gene (lane 3), the tRNALys3 detected is entirely in the aminoacylated form. As also shown in panel A, a majority of the total tRNALys3 is aminoacylated in cells transfected with genes encoding tRNA CGULys3 (lane 5) and tRNA SGULys3 (lane 6). In contrast, a larger proportion of total tRNALys3 is in the deacylated form in cells transfected with genes encoding tRNA CGALys3 (lane 4) and tRNA SGALys3 (lane 7). Although the data in Fig. 6 A (lanes 4–7) suggest that the tRNALys3 anticodon mutants are defective in in vivo aminoacylation, the total tRNALys3probed in these experiments consists of both endogenous wild-type tRNALys3 and exogenous wild-type or mutant tRNALys3. Thus to more directly probe the capability of the tRNALys3 mutants to be aminoacylated, we used anticodon DNA probes specific to the different tRNAs (Fig. 6, panels B–E). Lanes 8, 11, 14, and 17 represent mutant tRNALys3 samples that have been deacylated in vitro at alkaline pH, whereas lanes 9, 12, 15, and 18 contain cellular RNA from cells transfected with HIV-1 proviral DNA, as well as the various tRNA genes. To demonstrate the hybridization specificity of the anticodon probes, we also probed cellular RNA from cells transfected only with HIV-1 proviral DNA (lanes 10,13, 16, and 19). Based on the data presented in these panels, we conclude that tRNA SGULys3 (lane 9) and tRNA CGULys3 (lane 12) are aminoacylated to a significantly greater extent in vivo than tRNA CGALys3 (lane 15) and tRNA SGALys3 (lane 18). The latter two variants are present exclusively in the uncharged state. The percentage of wild-type or mutant tRNALys3 present in the aminoacylated state is shown graphically in panel F. Fig. 7 shows a plot of the relative tRNALys3 incorporation into HIV-1 for each of the anticodon variants tested in this work versus the percentage of aminoacylated tRNA detected in vivo. The linear correlation is striking and shows that the ability of tRNALys3 to be incorporated into HIV-1 is closely correlated with its ability to be aminoacylated. The efficiency of aminoacylation by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases may be described by an overall specificity constant (kcat/Km), which contains a catalytic rate constant (kcat), as well as a binding parameter (Km). Previous studies indicated that the U35G anticodon mutation in human tRNALys3abolished in vitro aminoacylation (>3000-fold decrease in kcat/Km) and that this change affected both LysRS binding and catalysis (12Stello T. Hong M. Musier-Forsyth K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Despite this dramatic effect on the ability to be aminoacylated with lysine in vitro, we report here that mutants with changes only in U35 (tRNA SGULys3) or in both S34 and U35 (tRNA CGULys3) are still aminoacylated in vivo to significant levels (Fig. 6). These mutations change the anticodon to the sequence found in tRNAThr. The anticodon is a major recognition element for Escherichia coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase in vitro (24Hasegawa T. Miyano M. Himeno H. Sano Y. Kimura K. Shimizu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 184: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, a change in the anticodon can switch the identity of E. coli elongator methionine tRNA (tRNAMetm) from methionine to threonine, showing that it is also a major identity determinant in vivo (25Schulman L.H. Pelka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Assuming that human threonyl-tRNA synthetase maintains this strong anticodon recognition, it may be that the XGU anticodon variants tested here are at least partially charged with threonine in vivo. Based on in vitro studies, a single U36A change in human tRNALys3 affects primarily the kcatparameter with only a 3-fold increase in Km and an overall 182-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency. Coupling the U36A mutation with a U35G change abolished in vivo aminoacylation and packaging into HIV-1 (Fig. 7). Both the UGA and the CGA anticodons correspond to sequences normally found in tRNASerisoacceptors. It has been shown that human seryl-tRNA synthetase does not use the anticodon as a recognition element but instead requires a long variable extra arm (26Achsel T. Gross H.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3333-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27Wu X.-Q. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5589-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that human tRNA SGALys3 or tRNA CGALys3 would be aminoacylated by serine in vivo, consistent with our observations that in vivo aminoacylation is abolished in these variants. In this work, the data indicate that the anticodon of human tRNALys3 is a major determinant for packaging into HIV-1 (Fig. 7) with the caveat that we do not yet know whether altering the anticodon sequence affects modifications elsewhere in the tRNA molecule. However, a clear correlation between aminoacylation and packaging has been established (Fig. 7). Based on these data, we cannot determine whether aminoacylation itself is a prerequisite for packaging or whether the major factor is LysRS binding. To address this question, the identity of the amino acid attached to the mutant tRNAs that are incorporated to significant extents (i.e. tRNA SGULys3 and tRNA CGULys3) must be determined, and these experiments are planned. The data presented in this work support a model in which the tRNALys3/LysRS interaction is important for tRNALys3 incorporation into viruses. We also show that the anticodon is a major determinant for packaging. However, the anticodon sequence has also been shown to contribute to the in vitro binding of mature reverse transcriptase in studies using either native tRNALys3 (28Sarih-Cottin L. Bordier B. Musier-Forsyth K. Andreola M. Barr P.J. Litvak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or unmodified tRNALys3transcripts (29Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 30Wöhrl B.M. Ehresmann B. Keith G. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13617-13624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other data suggest that RT sequences in the precursor Gag-Pol polyprotein interact with tRNALys3 during its incorporation into virions (6Mak J. Jiang M. Wainberg M.A. Hammarskjold M.-L. Rekosh D. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Khorchid A. Javanbakht H. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, an anticodon mutation might also weaken this tRNALys3/Gag-Pol interaction. However, there is no clear evidence to date that the interaction between RT sequences in Gag-Pol and the anticodon of tRNALys3 is involved in its packaging into HIV-1, and in fact, mutations in RT that prevent the enzyme from interacting with the tRNALys3 antiodon in vitro (31Arts E.J.

https://openalex.org/W2065755595,"Specific point mutations in caveolin-3, a predominantly muscle-specific member of the caveolin family, have been implicated in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and in rippling muscle disease. We examined the effect of these mutations on caveolin-3 localization and function. Using two independent assay systems, Raf activation in fibroblasts and neurite extension in PC12 cells, we show that one of the caveolin-3 point mutants, caveolin-3-C71W, specifically inhibits signaling by activated H-Ras but not by K-Ras. To gain insights into the effect of the mutant protein on H-Ras signaling, we examined the localization of the mutant proteins in fibroblastic cells and in differentiating myotubes. Unlike the previously characterized caveolin-3-DGV mutant, the inhibitory caveolin-3-C71W mutant reached the plasma membrane and colocalized with wild type caveolins. In BHK cells, caveolin-3-C71W associated with caveolae and in differentiating muscle cells with the developing T-tubule system. In contrast, the caveolin-3-P104L mutant accumulated in the Golgi complex and had no effect on H-Ras-mediated Raf activation. Inhibition by caveolin-3-C71W was rescued by cholesterol addition, suggesting that the mutant protein perturbs cholesterol-rich raft domains. Thus, we have demonstrated that a naturally occurring caveolin-3 mutation can inhibit signaling involving cholesterol-sensitive raft domains.

Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), Cav3 is thought to play a vital and direct role in the formation of the characteristic flask-shaped pits typical of caveolae. In addition to this structural role, caveolins have been implicated in signal transduction and in lipid transport (4Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The role of caveolae and Cav3 in muscle has become clinically relevant with the finding that mutations in the gene for Cav3 are associated with several muscle pathologies including a rare form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C and hereditary rippling muscle disease (5McNally E.M. de Sa Moreira E.

To date, one microdeletion and five point mutations (R26Q, A45T or A45V, G55S, C71W, and P104L; note that this nomenclature assumes a single Met at the N terminus) have been described. While four of these mutant proteins cause a decrease in Cav3 expression, in other cases surface expression of the protein appears normal (5McNally E.M. de Sa Moreira E. Duggan D.J. Bonnemann C.G.

Defining the function of Cav3, identifying its interacting partners, and characterizing the effect of the myopathy-associated mutations on muscle function is therefore of vital importance. Moreover, the specific point mutants of Cav3 that are associated with the skeletal muscle defects may provide powerful new tools in studies of the role of caveolins in both muscle and nonmuscle cells. caveolin hemagglutinin wild type mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase yellow fluorescent protein green fluorescent protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid caveolin hemagglutinin wild type mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase yellow fluorescent protein green fluorescent protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Cav3 expression is up-regulated as myoblasts fuse to form myotubes (1Way M.

In mature muscle, the sarcolemma is highly organized into regularly spaced Cav3-positive caveolar domains separated by noncaveolar domains (12Rahkila P. Takala T.E. Parton R.G. Metsikko K. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cav3 shows partial colocalization with elements of the dystrophin complex (12Rahkila P. Takala T.E. Parton R.G. Metsikko K. Exp.

In fact, interactions between Cav3 and dystroglycan through a WW-like domain in Cav3 have been suggested to mediate a direct interaction between these two proteins (15Sotgia F. Lee J.K. Das K.

While Cav3 is predominantly associated with the sarcolemma of mature muscle, in differentiating muscle cells Cav3 associates with the developing T-tubule system (11Parton R.G. Way M. Zorzi N.

The functional significance of the association with this extensive plasma membrane subdomain is as yet unknown, but both caveolae and the developing T-tubule system show similar morphology and are sensitive to cholesterol-disrupting agents (11Parton R.G. Way M. Zorzi N. Stang E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 137-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 17Carozzi A.J. Ikonen E. Lindsay M.R. Parton R.G.

Recent reports of T-tubule defects in Cav3-deficient mice suggest that Cav3 may be involved in the organization of the T-tubules but is not essential for their formation (19Galbiati F. Engelman J.A. Volonte D. Zhang X.L. Minetti C., Li, M. Hou H., Jr. Kneitz B. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21425-21433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Caveolins have been shown to interact in vitro with a number of signaling molecules including trimeric G protein subunits, Src kinases, and Raf through direct interactions of these proteins with a conserved region of caveolin termed the caveolin scaffolding domain (20Razani B. Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2103-2109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that this domain of caveolin can interact with, and apparently insert into, lipid bilayers (21Schlegel A. Schwab R.B. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

An additional hypothesis for the role of caveolins has emerged with the finding that Cav1 is a lipid-binding protein. Cav1 binds both cholesterol (23Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) and fatty acids (24Trigatti B.L. Anderson R.G. Gerber G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and its expression is regulated by cholesterol at the transcriptional level (25Hailstones D. Sleer L.S. Parton R.G.

A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cav1 expression also increases cholesterol transport (28Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we have shown that exogenous expression of a Cav3 truncation mutant, Cav3-DGV, in fibroblastic cells disrupts lipid transport and causes inhibition of specific signaling pathways (29Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Rather than a direct interaction with signaling proteins, these studies suggest that the mutant protein affects lipid homeostasis and so causes disruption of cholesterol-rich surface domains, termed lipid rafts, with which specific signaling pathways are associated (4Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The muscle cell surface has been shown to be arranged into highly organized arrays of caveolae raft domains (12Rahkila P. Takala T.E. Parton R.G. Metsikko K. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In view of the finding that artificial Cav3 truncation mutants can inhibit signal transduction through raft domains (29Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we speculated that naturally occurring Cav3 mutants may also affect signaling through sarcolemmal raft domains and that these mutants may provide excellent tools to dissect caveolin function. In the present study, we have characterized the mutant Cav3 proteins functionally using two different assays to monitor raft- and non-raft-mediated Ras-dependent signaling events. We show that one Cav3 point mutant reaches the cell surface and specifically inhibits H-Ras-dependent signaling pathways with the inhibition being rescued by cholesterol addition. These findings give new insights into the effect of specific point mutations on caveolin function, the role of caveolins in regulating raft-dependent signaling events, and the potential effect of caveolin dysfunction in muscle. BHK cells and C2C12cells were maintained as described previously (17Carozzi A.J. Ikonen E. Lindsay M.R. Parton R.G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 326-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Roy S.

PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) horse serum, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against p23 (30Rojo M. Pepperkok R. Emery G. Kellner R. Stang E. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J.

A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the hemagglutinin (HA) tag was a generous gift from Professor David James (University of Queensland, Australia). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to the conserved region of Cav3 (αCon-Cav) has been characterized previously (32Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody to Cav1 was from Transduction Laboratories (catalog no. C13630). Other reagents have been described previously (31Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). HA-tagged Cav3 point mutants were generated by PCR using mouse HA-tagged Cav3 as template. Cav3-DGV has been described previously (32Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cav3-LLS comprises residues 74–150 of Cav3. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. BHK cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE or LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. C2C12 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, myoblasts were transfected at confluence in differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% (v/v) Serum Supreme (BioWhittaker) and 2 mm l-glutamine) using 4 μg of total DNA/14 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 in a total volume of 2.4 ml of medium (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated overnight with the DNA mixture before it was replaced by fresh differentiation medium, which was subsequently replaced every 2 days prior to fixation, which routinely occurred 4–6 days postremoval of the transfection reagent (at which point the myoblasts had morphologically fused to form multinucleated myotubes). PC12 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were left with the DNA transfection mix for 5 h prior to addition of medium containing 20% (v/v) calf serum. This medium was replaced the following day by standard PC12 maintenance medium, and the cells were incubated a further 24 h prior to fixation. In BHK cells, the HA-tagged wild type (WT) and mutant Cav3 proteins were expressed at comparable levels. Note that no correlation was found between expression level of the HA-tagged proteins and ability of the mutants to inhibit H-Ras function. Membrane fractions (P100) from transfected BHK cells were normalized for Raf protein content via Western blot analysis and assayed for Raf activity using a two-stage coupled MEK/ERK assay with phosphorylation of myelin basic protein as readout exactly as described previously (33Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cholesterol supplementation was carried out for 1 h using a mix of 16 μg/ml cholesterol with 0.4% cyclodextrin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium exactly as described previously (34Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Sucrose gradients of transfected BHK cells and subsequent Western blot analysis were performed exactly as described previously (31Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat.

For immunofluorescence studies, cells were routinely fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunolabeled according to Pol et al. (37Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic localization of Cav3 mutants in plasma membrane sheets was performed exactly as described previously (31Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). We used a model fibroblast transfection system to examine the possible effect of Cav3 myopathy mutants on H- or K-Ras-mediated Raf activation. Ras recruits Raf from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where Raf activation proceeds through a complex pathway involving interactions with lipids, displacement of 14-3-3, and phosphorylation (38Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). By co-expression of the mutants with activated Ras (H- or K-Ras) and with Raf, we examined the effect of the Cav3 mutants on two aspects of Ras function: association of Raf with membranes (Raf recruitment) and activation of Raf (Raf specific activity). It was found that, as has been published previously (29Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), neither Ras expression nor recruitment of Raf to the membrane by constitutively activated H-Ras (H-RasG12V) or K-Ras (K-RasG12V) was affected by co-expression of the mutant proteins (data not shown). Moreover, Raf activation by K-Ras was also unaffected by co-expression of the WT or mutant Cav3 proteins (Fig. 1). In striking contrast, one of the mutants, Cav3-C71W, showed a strong inhibition of H-Ras-mediated Raf activation. The level of inhibition was comparable to that seen with the previously documented Cav3-DGV N-terminal truncation mutant (which lacks amino acids 1–54) (29Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Cav3-WT and the Cav3-G55S and Cav3-P104L mutants had no significant effect on H-Ras-mediated Raf activation. Since the caveolin scaffolding domain (amino acids 55–73), in which three dystrophy-associated mutations occur, has been implicated in the direct binding of signaling molecules, we also examined whether a caveolin truncation mutant that lacks this region would inhibit H-Ras-mediated Raf activation as effectively as the Cav3-DGV mutant. In fact, the Cav3-LLS mutant, which lacks the entire N-terminal domain of Cav3 (amino acids 1–73), was a specific and potent inhibitor of H-Ras-mediated Raf activation showing that the scaffolding domain was not required for the inhibitory effect. To validate the use of the Ras/Raf transfection assay for studies of the caveolin mutants, we examined whether the Cav3-C71W mutant would inhibit signaling in a completely different Ras assay system. For this we took advantage of the well characterized role of Ras in regulating neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (39Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Introduction of activated H-Ras (Fig. 2) or K-Ras (not shown) into undifferentiated PC12 cells caused extensive neurite outgrowth, although the extent of neurite outgrowth induced by K-Ras was not as marked as that induced by H-Ras. Activated H-Ras was then transfected into PC12 cells together with Cav3-WT, Cav3-DGV, or the Cav3 point mutants. As shown in Fig. 2, Cav3-DGV and Cav3-C71W caused a dramatic inhibition of H-Ras-mediated neurite extension. The same mutant proteins had no effect on K-Ras-mediated neurite outgrowth (results not shown). Thus, we have identified a point mutation in Cav3 that inhibits H-Ras signaling in two independent assays. We have postulated that Cav3-DGV specifically inhibits H-Ras signaling through an effect on cellular cholesterol. Cav3-DGV accumulates intracellularly and does not reach the cell surface. We therefore examined the localization of the inhibitory and noninhibitory Cav3 point mutants in fibroblasts and in differentiating muscle cells. Cav3-WT localizes to surface caveolae and the Golgi complex of nonmuscle cells (32Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and to surface caveolae and T-tubules of differentiating muscle cells (11Parton R.G. Way M. Zorzi N. Stang E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 137-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the Cav3 point mutants showed aberrant localization by expression of the HA epitope-tagged forms of the protein in BHK cells. By immunofluorescence microscopy, the labeling patterns for Cav3-G55S and Cav3-C71W were indistinguishable from Cav3-WT-HA. In contrast, Cav3-P104L was predominantly (although not exclusively) in the Golgi complex, consistent with previous studies (40Galbiati F. Volonte D. Minetti C. Chu J.B. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25632-25641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We then examined the localization of the mutant proteins in C2C12cells, a model muscle cell line. As in the nonmuscle cells, the labeling patterns for Cav3-G55S and -C71W were largely indistinguishable from Cav3-WT, labeling the cell surface and putative T-tubules. The Cav3-P104L mutant, in contrast, gave a striking perinuclear labeling, which colocalized with the cis Golgi marker protein, p23, in all the transfected cells (Fig. 3). In view of the inhibitory effect of the Cav3-C71W mutant, we examined the localization of this protein in more detail. By confocal microscopy the Cav3-C71W mutant colocalized with Cav3-WT-YFP in co-transfected C2C12 cells (Fig. 3). In BHK cells, Cav3-C71W localized to caveolae as shown by immunoelectron microscopy on plasma membrane sheets (Fig. 3). Therefore Cav3-C71W behaves in a manner similar to the Cav3-DGV mutant in terms of its effect on H-Ras signaling but does not localize to the same compartment; in fact the Cav3-C71W mutant traffics in a manner similar to the wild type protein. The results also show for the first time that the Cav3-P104L mutant is strongly retained in the Golgi complex of muscle cells, consistent with results in fibroblasts (40Galbiati F. Volonte D.

The results also show that accumulation of a caveolin mutant intracellularly is not sufficient to inhibit H-Ras signaling, emphasizing the specificity of the inhibition mediated by the Cav3-DGV mutant. In view of the different location of the inhibitory mutants Cav3-DGV and Cav3-C71W, we examined whether the Cav3-C71W mutant was inhibiting H-Ras signaling through an effect on cholesterol as demonstrated previously for the Cav3-DGV mutant. A cyclodextrin/cholesterol mixture was used to supplement the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane of cells expressing Cav3-C71W or Cav3-DGV. Strikingly a 1-h incubation with cyclodextrin/cholesterol completely restored Raf activity in cells expressing Raf, H-Ras, and Cav3-C71W (Fig. 4), a similar effect to that seen in cells expressing the Cav3-DGV mutant. This suggests that the Cav3-C71W mutant perturbs cholesterol-dependent surface signaling events. We therefore investigated whether Cav3-C71W caused gross changes in free cholesterol distribution. No significant changes were observed by filipin staining (results not shown). We also examined whether Cav3-C71W showed different detergent insolubility characteristics or oligomerization properties as compared with expressed wild type Cav3. In both cases the properties of the Cav3-C71W mutant were indistinguishable from the wild type protein (results not shown). We next examined whether expression of the Cav3-C71W mutant affected raft domains. We used a modified flotation method in which carbonate-treated membranes are separated on a linear sucrose gradient to separate raft and non-raft domains (31Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Cav3-WT, Cav3-C71W, or Cav3-DGV were transfected with GFP-tH, a raft marker comprising the H-Ras minimal membrane-targeting domain attached to the C terminus of GFP. Both Cav3-C71W and Cav3-DGV, but not Cav3-WT, caused a significant shift of the raft marker GFP-tH to denser fractions (Fig. 5) consistent with the postulated effect of these proteins on plasma membrane raft domains. Interestingly, however, it was noted that the extent of the shift was different for the two mutants with the Cav3-C71W mutant causing a more modest shift of a portion of the GFP-tH from its normal position on the density gradient. It is assumed that the increase in density of the GFP-tH-containing rafts is due to a decrease in cholesterol in raft domains, consistent with rescue of H-Ras inhibition by cholesterol addition. Note that there was no difference in the density of fractions containing Cav3-WT and Cav3-C71W on the gradients (Fig. 5), further supporting the localization data (Fig. 3). The flotation of endogenous Cav1 was also unaffected by co-expression of Cav3-C71W (data not shown), highlighting the significance of the reproducible shift observed for GFP-tH and suggesting that caveolae domains are not significantly affected by mutant expression. Finally we explored the relevant features of the Cav3-C71W mutant that make it inhibitory to H-Ras function. We first generated a new HA-tagged Cav3 mutant, Cav3-C71A, in which the amino acid at position 71 was changed from a cysteine to an alanine. This mutant was used to determine whether the impact of the mutation in Cav3-C71W is due to the loss of the cysteine residue, which is conserved within Cav3 from different species, or to the presence of the substituted bulky hydrophobic tryptophan. Cav3-C71A localized in BHK cells in a manner indistinguishable from that observed for the Cav3-WT or Cav3-C71W mutant (data not shown). Unlike the Cav3-C71W mutant, however, the Cav3-C71A mutant was unable to inhibit H-Ras-mediated Raf activation (Fig. 1) and did not inhibit activated H-Ras-mediated neurite outgrowth in the PC12 assay (Fig. 2). This would argue that it is the acquisition of the tryptophan at position 71 that alters Cav3 function. In addition we investigated whether plasma membrane localization was essential for the inhibition of H-Ras signaling by Cav3-C71W. The N terminus of Cav3 has been shown to be required for caveolar localization of Cav3 (32Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we have found that the introduction of point mutants in conserved amino acids in this region, such as the arginine at position 26 (a naturally occurring dystrophy mutant) and the highly conserved proline at position 28, resulted in the intracellular retention of the resultant mutants in the C2C12 system (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, introducing a proline to histidine change in Cav3-C71W at position 28 caused the mutant protein (Cav3-P28H/C71W) to accumulate intracellularly in BHK and C2C12 cells. The mutant protein was unable to inhibit H-Ras-mediated Raf activation (Fig. 1). The lack of inhibitory effect of the double mutant was confirmed using the PC12 neurite outgrowth assay (Fig. 2). We have shown, therefore, that a single point mutation in Cav3, a cysteine to tryptophan substitution at amino acid position 71, can cause perturbation of cholesterol-dependent raft signaling domains using two independent Ras assays. The Ras assays provide powerful model systems to study raft-dependent and -independent signaling pathways as shown in this and previous studies (29Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Ras has been implicated in regulation of muscle genes during differentiation and in response to nerve activity, but the involvement of distinct Ras isoforms in muscle is unknown. Genetic ablation of H-Ras (and N-Ras) expression in mice had no discernible phenotype (41Esteban L.M. Vicario-Abejon C. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fernandez- Medarde A. Swaminathan N. Yienger K. Lopez E. Malumbres M. McKay R. Ward J.M. Pellicer A. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1444-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) in contrast to the embryonically lethal effects of K-Ras ablation (42Johnson L. Greenbaum D. Cichowski K. Mercer K. Murphy E. Schmitt E. Bronson R.T. Umanoff H. Edelmann W. Kucherlapati R. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2468-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), suggesting that H-Ras is not essential for muscle differentiation in vivo. While we have used Ras as an assay, it is likely that other signaling events utilizing raft domains may be affected in muscle cells expressing the Cav3-C71W protein in vivo. A possibly analogous situation was reported recently in neurons from mice with Niemann-Pick type C in which it was shown that the cholesterol imbalance associated with the disease caused defects in specific raft-dependent signaling pathways (43Henderson L.P. Lin L. Prasad A. Paul C.A. Chang T.Y. Maue R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20179-20187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly it has been reported that in Cav3 knockout mice the dystrophin complex no longer floats on a sucrose density gradient (19Galbiati F. Engelman J.A. Volonte D. Zhang X.L. Minetti C., Li, M. Hou H., Jr. Kneitz B. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21425-21433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) implying that Cav3, via an ability to profoundly influence raft domain formation, may also impact on the performance of raft resident structural proteins. We speculate that the Cav3-C71W-induced disruption of cholesterol-rich domains in muscle may underlie the mild dystrophic phenotype caused by the mutant protein. However, it is important to note that a recent study suggested that a number of the described Cav3 point mutations also occurred in nondystrophic individuals and may therefore represent polymorphisms (44de Paula F. Vainzof M. Bernardino A.L. McNally E. Kunkel L.M. Zatz M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 99: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the case of Cav3-C71W, of 100 apparently healthy individuals screened, one subject was found to carry that mutation. In view of the striking effects of the mutant protein described here, it is possible that the effects of Cav3-C71W may be balanced by compensatory mechanisms in some, but not all, genetic backgrounds. In support of this, it has recently been reported that the Cav3-P104L mutation, originally documented in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, is also found in patients with a separate muscle disorder known as hereditary rippling muscle disease (10Betz R.C. Schoser B.G. Kasper D. Ricker K. Ramirez A. Stein V. Torbergsen T. Lee Y.A. Nothen M.M. Wienker T.F. Malin J.P. Propping P. Reis A. Mortier W. Jentsch T.J. Vorgerd M. Kubisch C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 218-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), further verifying that both genetic and environmental backgrounds influence phenotypic outcome. The effects of the Cav3-C71W mutant show similarities to those previously described for the Cav3-DGV mutant in the specificity for H-Ras-mediated signaling events, rescue by addition of cholesterol, and the effect on the density of raft-containing membranes (Ref. 29Roy S. Luetterforst R. Harding A. Apolloni A. Etheridge M. Stang E. Rolls B. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar and this study). However, unlike the Cav3-DGV mutant, Cav3-C71W reaches cell surface caveolae, and based on comparison with a double mutant impaired in transport to the surface, this surface localization may be required for its inhibitory effects. Caveolins have been implicated in cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane and may therefore be important in regulating the availability of plasma membrane cholesterol for raft domains. We have speculated that Cav3-DGV perturbs the distribution of free cholesterol in the cell, causing intracellular accumulation in late endosomes, and therefore reduces the availability of cholesterol required for functional surface raft domains (37Pol A. Luetterforst R. Lindsay M. Heino S. Ikonen E. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1057-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As the Cav3-C71W mutant has a similar effect and yet reaches the cell surface and has no apparent gross effects on free cholesterol distribution, the mechanisms involved are presumably distinct. It is possible that the C71W mutation increases the affinity of Cav3 for cholesterol and prevents release of cholesterol from caveolae to noncaveolar lipid rafts, but further work is required to test this hypothesis. Our results suggest that the addition of tryptophan rather than the loss of cysteine may be important. Interestingly the corresponding amino acid is highly conserved in mammalian Cav1 and is a phenylalanine. Thus, the tryptophan substitution might make Cav3 more like Cav1 in this region. The identification of a single amino acid residue that changes the properties of the Cav3 protein so dramatically provides a valuable tool for studies of caveolins, cholesterol, and raft domains. Moreover, we have revealed a potential mechanism by which mutations in Cav3 can induce defects in specific signaling pathways that could lead to long term pathological changes. We are grateful to Rob Luetterforst for excellent technical assistance."

We are interested in the elucidation of the functional switch of Axin. In the present study, we show that the Wnt activator CKIε, but not CKIIα, Frat1, LRP5, or LRP6, inhibited Axin-mediated JNK activation. We also found that both CKIα and CKIε interacted with Axin, whereas CKIIα did not bind to Axin and had no effect on Axin-mediated JNK activity even though CKIIα has also been suggested to be an activator for the Wnt pathway. The COOH-terminal region and the MEKK1-interacting domain of Axin are important for CKIα-Axin and CKIε-Axin interaction. We further demonstrated that CKIε and CKIα binding to Axin excluded MEKK1 binding, indicating that a competitive physical occupancy may underlie the inhibitory effect. Moreover, our data indicated that CKIε kinase activity plays an additive role in this effect.

In addition, we have recently shown that ectopic expression of Axin-induced stress-activated protein kinase JNK activation, and also found that Axin interacts with MEKK1 specifically on a domain flanked by the regulator of G protein signaling domain and the GSK-3β-binding site (5Zhang Y.

The potential significance of the Axin-MEKK1 interaction is evident for the following reasons. First of all, Axin possesses a distinct binding domain for MEKK1, which we termed the MID domain. Second, MEKK1 binding per se does not suffice to activate JNK, as Axin also requires its C terminus for JNK activation. Furthermore, Axin activation of JNK is highly regulated by the Dishevelled protein (28Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), GSK-3β binding (29Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y., He, X. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

More importantly, Axin could cause apoptosis in certain cells, which requires its JNK activating activity (30Neo S.Y. Zhang Y. Yaw L.P., Li, P. Lin S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

While biological models are being created to address the biological functions of the Axin-mediated JNK activation, we are interested in the functional switch of Axin for its dual function in the MEKK1/JNK pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway. adenomatous polyposis coli casein kinase Iα casein kinase Iε casein kinase IIα frequently rearranged in activated T-cell glycogen synthase kinase-3β c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein MEKK1-interacting domain protein phosphatase 2A hemagglutinin Casein kinase Iε (CKIε) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes ranging from DNA replication and repair to circadian rhythm (31Fish K.J.

Recently, through a functional cloning of factors that control axis formation in Xenopus, CKIε was identified to be an activator for Wnt signaling. Overexpression of CKIε mimics Wnt by stabilizing β-catenin, thereby increasing expression of β-catenin-dependent genes (37Sakanaka C. Leong P., Xu, L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Inhibition of endogenous CKIε attenuated gene transcription stimulated by Wnt, indicating that the kinase activity of CKIε is critical in transducing Wnt signal (37Sakanaka C. Leong P., Xu, L.

Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), underscoring its biological significance in the Wnt pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed that CKIε is present in the Dishevelled·Axin complex (37Sakanaka C. Leong P., Xu, L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CKIε has also been shown to phosphorylate APC, in a manner that depends on Axin (40Rubinfeld B. Tice D.A. Polakis P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39037-39045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). One report also indicated that CKIα, another member of the CKI family, participates in transducing the Wnt signal (41McKay R.M. Peters J.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that casein kinase II (CKII), which is involved in many proliferation-related processes in the cell, potentiates Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mammary epithelial cells (42Song D.H.

The bifunctional nature of Axin suggested a switching mechanism might exist between the Wnt and JNK pathways. We previously found that GSK-3β binding to Axin prevents Axin activation of JNK, and that its kinase activity is not required for this inhibiting effect, indicating that other factors may also participate the functional switch mechanism. In our continuous effort to elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for Axin functional switch, we first tested if CKIε could affect JNK activation by Axin. Surprisingly, CKIε drastically attenuated the Axin/JNK signaling. In contrast, other Wnt signaling activators Frat1, LRP5, and LRP6 had no effect on Axin-mediated JNK activation. Moreover, we show that CKIα also exerts an inhibitory effect on Axin-mediated JNK activity. However, the casein kinase II family member CKIIα has no effect on Axin-mediated JNK activity although it also activates the Wnt pathway. We further demonstrated that the binding of CKIε and CKIα to Axin excludes Axin-MEKK1 interaction in vivo, providing a possible direct mechanism for their inhibitory effect on the Axin-mediated JNK activation. Furthermore, we show that CKIε kinase activity also contributes to this inhibitory effect, as a kinase-dead CKIεK38R mutant partially lost its ability to inhibit the JNK activation and had reduced binding affinity for Axin. Thus, CKI may exert two antagonistic roles in Axin-based signaling pathways: one to prevent Axin-mediated destabilization of β-catenin, and the other to inhibit Axin-induced JNK activation. These results provide a hypothetical switch mechanism for Axin dual function as regulated by CKI. Plasmids of mouse Axin, its deletion mutants, and FLAG-tagged JNK1, were described previously (5Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). LRP5 and LRP6 were previously constructed (19Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). CKIα was NH2-terminal tagged with HA through the NcoI site in pBluescript-HA vector and was transferred to pCMV5 vector through its EcoRI and XbaI sites. CKIIα and CKIIαKM were HA-tagged and transferred into the pCMV5 vector via its EcoRI and BamHI sites. CKIεK38R was created by site-directed mutagensis using the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene); the oligonucleotide sequences used to create the CKIεK38R mutant were 5′-GAAGTCGCCATCAGGCTGGAGTGTGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CACACACTCCAGCCTGATGGCGACTTCC-3′. CKIεC1 was generated by removal of the SalI/XbaI region of full-length CKIε, and these two sites were ligated to create a stop codon. CKIεC2 was generated by ligation of the NH2-terminal NcoI/EcoRI fragment with the PCR-generated kinase domain region. The oligonucleotide sequences used for PCR were 5′-CTCTGCAAAGGCTATCCCTCCGAATTCTC-3′ and 5′-TTCTAGAGCATGTTCCAGTCAAAGACG-3′. CKIεC3 was generated by deletion of the EcoRI/XbaI fragment, followed by blunt-end reaction and re-ligation. Expression plasmid for HA-MEKK1 was a gift from Dr. M. Karin (University of California, San Diego). Frat1 was from Dr. A. Berns (The Netherlands Cancer Institute), and pGL3-fos-7LEF-luciferase was from Dr. L. T. William (Chiron Co.). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Transfections were performed in 60-mm dishes using SuperfectTM according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 4 μg with the empty vector pCMV5 where necessary. Cells were harvested at 40 h post-transfection and lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). FLAG-tagged JNK1 was immunoprecipitated using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma); the JNK activity was determined as described previously using 1 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) (Stratagene) as substrate (5Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), followed by Western blotting using Phospho-c-Jun antibody (Cell Signaling) to examine the phosphorylation of c-Jun. Fold activation of the kinase was determined by an imaging analyzer (Molecular Dynamics model 425E) and normalized to their expression levels. Data are expressed as fold kinase activation compared with that in vector-transfected cells with the values representing the mean ± S.E. from three separate experiments. Transiently transfected 293T cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed in the same lysis buffer as described above. Cell lysates were sonicated three times for 5 s each, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Axin, CKIε, CKIα, CKIIα, and MEKK1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with anti-Myc (9E10), anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and anti-MEKK1 (C-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies as indicated, and with protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in 4 °C for 3 h. Immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as previously described (5Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The boiled samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, the membranes were probed with anti-Myc (9E10), anti-MEKK1 (C-22), anti-HA, or anti-FLAG antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). 293T cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of pGL3-fos-7LEF-luciferase, 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase, and 0.2 μg of vector, CKIε, or mutant CKIεK38R, using DOSPER according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Luciferase activities were measured as previously described (30Neo S.Y. Zhang Y. Yaw L.P., Li, P. Lin S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At 32 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and divided into two portions and measured for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities (Promega). The ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity varied less than 10% among the samples. Data are presented as means from three separate experiments performed in triplicate. We previously made an interesting finding that Axin uses distinct combinations of functional domains in its role as a bifunctional protein in the Wnt signaling and MEKK1/JNK pathways (5Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It was not clear how these two Axin-modulated pathways may be coordinated. As part of our efforts to address the switching mechanism, we tested whether the Wnt activators CKIε, Frat1, LRP5, or LRP6 had any effect on Axin activation of JNK. We set out to address this question by expressing these Wnt signaling activators in 293T cells and monitoring the changes in Axin-mediated JNK activation using JNK immunokinase assay. As shown in Fig. 1,A and B, expression of Axin alone robustly activated JNK (∼11-fold) as seen previously (5Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 235: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Expression of CKIε, Frat1, LRP5, or LRP6 alone did not affect JNK activity in the immunokinase assay. Coexpression of Frat1, LRP5, or LRP6 with Axin had no effect on Axin-mediated JNK activation (Fig. 1 B). However, coexpression of CKIε with Axin significantly diminished the Axin-induced JNK activity (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, another member of the casein kinase I family, CKIα, also dramatically inhibited Axin-mediated JNK activation (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, expression of the casein kinase II family member CKIIα, either wild type or its kinase-dead mutant CKIIαKM, had no effect on Axin-mediated JNK activation (Fig. 1 A). Thus, Axin-mediated JNK activation is specifically inhibited by casein kinase I family members CKIε and CKIα. Previous studies had implied the presence of CKIε and CKII in Axin-based complexes. Yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that CKIε and CKII can bind to Dishevelled (38Sakanaka C. Sun T.Q. Williams L.T. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2000; 55: 225-236PubMed Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which CKIε and CKIα blocked Axin-JNK activation, we first tested whether CKIε and CKIα were physically associated with Axin. Immunoprecipitation assays using proteins tagged with different epitopes, coupled with Western blot analysis, revealed that Myc-Axin co-precipitated with CKIε or CKIα (Figs.2 A and 3). This interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding assay using bacterially expressed CKI protein and in vitro TNT generated35S-labeled Axin protein (data not shown). These data from the protein interaction assays are in agreement with a recent report (45Kishida M. Hino S.-i. Michiue T. Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Fukui A. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33147-33155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, CKIIα did not interact with Axin in the same immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 2 A).Figure 3CKIε has no effect on Axin homodimerization. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of HA-Axin and Myc-Axin in the presence or absence of 1 μg of FLAG-CKIε. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, or control IgG. The immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were then analyzed by immunoblotting separately using anti-HA, anti-Myc, and anti-FLAG for Axin and CKIε proteins, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then included MEKK1 in the coimmunoprecipitation assays to determine whether the inhibitory effect on JNK activation observed with the casein kinase members was due to their interference with MEKK1 binding to Axin. When MEKK1 was included in these co-transfection and immunoprecipitation assays, Myc-Axin was only detected in MEKK1 immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with either the control vector or HA-CKIIα, which did not bind to Axin; but not from cells transfected with CKIε or CKIα, which bound to Axin (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that CKIε or CKIα binding to Axin exclude MEKK1 from binding to Axin. In contrast, co-expression of CKIIα, Frat1, LRP5, or LRP6 did not affect Axin-MEKK1 interaction (Fig. 2 B). We have previously demonstrated that dimerization of Axin is required for its JNK activation. Specifically, Axin mutants that are still capable of binding to MEKK1 but lack of the dimerization domain failed to activate JNK. Intriguingly, MEKK1 also has to be present on both of the dimerized Axin proteins, as the Axin mutant AxinΔMID, which retains the dimerization domain but lacks the MEKK1-binding domain, effectively inhibits Axin-induced JNK activation (5Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To further address the mechanism whereby CKI members inhibit Axin-induced JNK activation, we asked if binding of CKIε or CKIα to Axin affects Axin homodimerization. HA- and Myc-tagged Axin proteins were coexpressed in the presence or absence of FLAG-tagged CKIε, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, HA-Axin was detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates, and vice versa. In the presence of FLAG-CKIε, anti-FLAG antibody could precipitate both HA- and Myc-tagged Axin (Fig. 3). Moreover, HA-Axin can still be detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates, and Myc-Axin detected in anti-HA precipitates, indicating that Axin homodimerization is not affected by CKIε (Fig. 3) or CKIα binding (data not shown). The finding that CKIα and CKIε directly interact with Axin prompted us to define the CKIε- and CKIα-binding sites on Axin. The schematic diagrams in Fig. 4 A depict the series of Myc-Axin mutant constructs used in co-transfection with HA-CKIε or HA-CKIα. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies for Axin and CKI, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4,B and C, wild type Axin as well as the Axin deletion mutant N1 were detected in CKIα (Fig. 4 B) and CKIε (Fig. 4 C) immunoprecipitates and vice versa, whereas the Axin mutant C1 lacking the COOH-terminal region was not co-precipitated with CKIα or CKIε, indicating that the COOH-terminal region of Axin is crucial for interaction with CKIα and CKIε. However, the COOH-terminal region alone (N3) is not sufficient for binding to either CKIα (Fig. 4 B) or CKIε (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, when the COOH-terminal of Axin was linked to the MID domain, this M3 Axin mutant restored the ability to interact both CKIα (Fig. 4 B) and CKIε (Fig. 4 C). Although the M2 Axin mutant lacking the MID domain could still bind to CKIα (Fig. 4 B), it showed significantly less affinity toward CKIε (Fig. 4 C). These data indicate that the binding of CKIε to Axin obviously requires both the COOH-terminal sequence and the MID domain on Axin, whereas CKIα primarily depends on the COOH-terminal region of Axin for interaction. Since the Axin COOH-terminal alone does not suffice for CKI binding, the interaction between CKI and Axin may elicit conformational changes. Next we determined the structural requirements of CKIε interaction with Axin. The schematic diagrams in Fig. 5 A depict Myc-CKIε constructs used in co-transfection with HA-Axin. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc and anti-HA for CKIε and Axin, respectively. Results from the Western blots shown in Fig. 5 B demonstrate that HA-Axin was detected in wild type Myc-CKIε, deletion mutants Myc-CKIεC1 and Myc-CKIεC2 immunoprecipitates, but not in the deletion mutant Myc-CKIεC3 immunoprecipitates, indicating that the region of amino acids 248 to 295 in the kinase domain of CKIε is important for Axin-CKIε interaction (Fig. 5 B). Consequently, when MEKK1 was included in these co-transfection and co-immunoprecipitation assays, HA-Axin was only detected in MEKK1 immunoprecipitates from samples co-transfected with vector or Myc-CKIεC3. MEKK1 immunoprecipitates from cells co-transfected with HA-Axin and wild type Myc-CKIε, Myc-CKIεC1, or Myc-CKIεC2, however, did not contain Axin (Fig. 5 C). Kinase activity of CKIε is crucial for its role in Wnt signaling in that inhibition of endogenous CKIε activity by the kinase-defective CKIεK38R or a CKIε antisense oligonucleotide attenuated gene transcription stimulated by Wnt-1 (37Sakanaka C. Leong P., Xu, L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We wondered if the kinase activity of CKIε is also required for inhibiting Axin-mediated JNK activation. Kinase-defective mutant CKIεK38R was generated, and coexpressed in the cells with FLAG-JNK1 and Axin. As shown in Fig. 6 A, expression of Axin alone induced JNK activation by 11-fold as observed earlier (Fig. 1 A). Expression of the wild type CKIε alone did not alter the already low basal JNK activity. However, the kinase-defective mutant CKIεK38R alone moderately enhanced basal JNK activity (Fig. 6 A). This was confirmed in the experiments using the casein kinase I inhibitor CK7,N-2-aminoethyl5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfonamide (Seikagaku Corp., Japan). Treatment of cells with 160 μmof the inhibitor CK7 for 10 h led to more than 2-fold enhancement of basal JNK activation. Consistently, expression of CKIε or CKIα in the presence of CK7 only partially attenuated Axin-mediated JNK activation (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, expression of CKIIα had no effect on Axin-mediated JNK activation (Figs. 1 A and6 A). These results suggest that the kinase activity of CKIε also contributes to the regulation of JNK activation by Axin. CKIεK38R bound to Axin on the same region as wild type CKIε binding to Axin (Fig. 6 B, and data not shown), and excluded MEKK1 from the Axin complex (Fig. 6 C), suggesting physical binding is an a priori condition for the CKI inhibitory effect. However, the binding affinity of CKIεK38R to Axin is less than that of wild type CKIε to Axin. That may help to explain the partial loss of the inhibitory effect of CKIεK38R on Axin-mediated JNK activation. This is also in agreement with the observation that the binding affinity of CKI to Axin is reduced upon treatment with casein kinase I inhibitor CK7 (data not shown). Compared with the partial requirement of the CKI kinase activity in the regulation of the Axin-JNK pathway, CKI kinase activity is fully required for the Wnt pathway (Fig6 D). Biological signals are often transduced via multimeric complex formations of intracellular proteins, which are coordinated by architectural proteins referred to as scaffold proteins. Axin has become one of the most studied such scaffold proteins, and it is known to interact with many proteins including APC, MEKK1, β-catenin, GSK-3β, Dishevelled, PP2A, and Axam (5Zhang Y. Neo S.Y.

Most perplexing is that the same scaffold proteins can form different complexes in response to different signals. Our previous work has shown that Axin forms different complexes in its bifunctional roles. When GSK-3β binds to its cognate site in Axin, MEKK1 cannot bind to the MID domain, although the two binding sites are physically separated. However, APC and β-catenin are present in both of the complexes either for Wnt signaling or the Axin/MEKK1 pathway, suggesting the default function of Axin is to down-regulate the function of β-catenin (29Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y., He, X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As a continuous effort to understand how Axin exerts its diverse roles, we have extended our studies to other factors that participate in the Wnt pathway, and thoroughly analyzed how casein kinases may modulate Axin function in the Axin-regulated JNK pathway. In this study, we have demonstrated that CKI can inhibit Axin-mediated JNK activation, but that CKII, Frat1, LRP5, and LRP6 cannot, although they all activate Wnt-dependent transcription. These results indicate that the regulation of Axin activated JNK by CKI is not directly linked to Wnt signaling itself. This is particularly true given that the kinase activity of CKIε is only partially involved in its inhibitory effect on the JNK pathway, whereas it is fully critical for transducing Wnt signaling. It is interesting that CKIε binds directly to both Dishevelled and Axin in the Dishevelled-Axin complex (37Sakanaka C. Leong P., Xu, L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 39Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 45Kishida M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 33147-33155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas CKII binds to only Dishevelled (46Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The importance of both CKI and CKII binding to Dishevelled in the Wnt signaling is demonstrated by the findings that both the CKIε (39Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and CKII (46Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) can phosphorylate and activate Dishevelled. CKIε binding to Axin has been shown to be important for its phosphorylation of the APC protein (40Rubinfeld B. Tice D.A. Polakis P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39037-39045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our results in this study further suggest that the importance of the direct binding of CKI to Axin is to engage Axin functionality in the Wnt pathway. Although the specific triggers of CKI to either activate Wnt or regulate MEKK1/JNK pathway is at present unclear, it is evident that CKI binding to Axin is required for its inhibitory effect on Axin activation of JNK. More importantly, it excludes MEKK1 binding on Axin, which is a prerequisite for Axin-mediated JNK activation. Recent reports showed that CKI binds to the COOH-terminal Axin region overlapping with the PP2A binding area (44McKay R.M. Peters J.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 45Kishida M. Hino S.-i. Michiue T. Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Fukui A. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33147-33155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our results here demonstrated that the COOH-terminal of Axin is required for its interaction with CKI, however, the COOH-terminal region alone does not suffice for CKI binding. These results indicate that binding of CKI to Axin may cause conformational changes in Axin, which may lead to the exclusion of MEKK1 binding to Axin. Indeed, our results here further demonstrated that the MID domain is also important for CKI binding, particularly for CKIε. The observed lesser inhibitory effect by the kinase-dead mutant CKIεK38R is mirrored by its diminished affinity for Axin, and is consistent with a requirement of its kinase domain for Axin binding. It is important to point out that the reduced binding affinity is not due to any protein structural change derived from the amino acid substitution, because experiments conducted with the casein kinase inhibitor CK7 also indicate that CKI kinase activity plays a role in the inhibition of Axin-mediated JNK activation. The kinase activity of CKIε is crucial in its role as an activator of the Wnt signaling pathway (37Sakanaka C. Leong P., Xu, L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 39Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that it activates the Wnt pathway, presumably by phosphorylating Dishevelled (38Sakanaka C. Sun T.Q. Williams L.T. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2000; 55: 225-236PubMed Google Scholar, 39Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the kinase activity of CKIε is important for APC function (40Rubinfeld B. Tice D.A. Polakis P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39037-39045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of CKIε is also necessary in its function to regulate circadian rhythm, in that CKIε controls the nuclear entry of the circadian regulator mPer1 by phosphorylation of mPer1 (32Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 47Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our results in this study showed that the kinase activity of CKI also contributes to the inhibitory effect on Axin-mediated JNK activation; unlike GSK-3β, in which the kinase activity of GSK-3β is fully dispensable for its inhibitory effect on Axin-mediated JNK activation (29Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y., He, X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results here, it is reported that inhibition of the kinase activity of CKI leads to JNK activation (44McKay R.M. Peters J.M. Graff J.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As GSK-3β plays a central role in transducing Wnt signaling, it is possible that CKI is not an initiating factor for Wnt signaling as in the case of Akt regulation of the Wnt pathway (48Fukumoto S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17479-17483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This leads us to speculate that CKI may serve to fine tune Axin function in the balance between the two distinct pathways, Wnt and JNK. The kinase activity of CKIε can be regulated, and maintained in an active state, by cellular protein phosphatases such as PP2A (36Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Given the fact that PP2A can bind to Axin through its catalytic domain (15Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) as well as bind to tumor suppressor APC through its B56 regulatory subunit (20Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), it is worth investigating the mutual regulation of PP2A and CKIε activation in the Wnt signaling pathway. As CKIε exhibits diverse functions, the specificity of the regulation of its kinase activities may require factors other than PP2A. Moreover, the present finding that the kinase activity of CKIε also partially contributes to its inhibitory effect on the JNK pathway further highlights the diversity of the function and regulation of this important kinase. In summary, we have demonstrated that CKI kinases bind directly to Axin and exclude Axin-MEKK1 interaction in vivo, thereby inhibiting Axin-mediated JNK activation. Moreover, our data have indicated that CKI kinase activity also contributed to this effect. Unlike CKI, CKII does not bind to Axin, and affects neither Axin-based molecular assemblies nor JNK activation. Thus, we have demonstrated that CKI and CKII exhibit differential effects on Axin-mediated JNK activation, and suggest that CKI may provide a possible switch mechanism for Axin function in the regulation of Wnt and JNK pathways.

Here, we evidenced that murine GSTA1 (mGSTA1), A4, Pi, and Mu are up-regulated during mouse liver regeneration, exhibiting a biphasic pattern of induction correlating early G1 phase and G1/S transition of the cell cycle. Using confocal microscopy immunolocalization and subcellular fractionation, mGSTA4 was demonstrated in both mitochondria and cytosol and found preferentially increased in cytosol during liver regeneration. In addition, mGSTA4 was induced in vivo and in cultured hepatocytes by tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and epidermal growth factor (EGF), factors that play crucial roles in hepatocyte survival and proliferation during liver regeneration. However, the mitogenic effect of EGF was not responsible for the induction of mGSTA4. In transient transfections, IL-6 and EGF, but not TNFα, transactivated the human GSTA4 (hGSTA4) promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene suggesting that IL-6 and EGF up-regulated hGSTA4 at a transcriptional level, whereas TNFα could rather act at a post-transcriptional level. The inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, p38 MAPK, and MEK/ERK signaling pathways, using specific inhibitors, prevented EGF-dependent induction of mGSTA4 and transactivation of hGSTA4 promoter. Altogether, these data favor the conclusion that, in regenerating hepatocytes, several GST isoforms are induced and that cytokines TNFα and IL-6 and survival factor EGF positively regulate mGSTA4 via survival signaling pathways.

Regarding ROS, TNFα is now recognized as playing a crucial role in the production of these species during liver regeneration. In support of such a role, it is worth noting that the multimerization of TNFα type I receptor following binding of TNFα has indeed been shown to lead to recruitment of TRAF (TNF receptor-associated protein), a protein involved in the signaling pathway regulating ROS production in mitochondria (15Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. Arch R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42728-42736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), probably through the inhibition of complex III of the electron transport chain (16Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both ROS and NO have been demonstrated to contribute significantly to induce hepatocyte proliferation. Indeed, in transgenic mice with targeted disruption of TNFα type I receptor (TNFRI) or of the type II nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of NO from arginine, hepatocyte proliferation after PH is strongly impaired (2Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 12Rai R.M. Lee F.Y. Rosen A. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Koteish A.

In this context, it then appears that TNFα-related oxidative stress functions as a signaling pathway rather than eliciting deleterious effects. Such a function is mediated through the activation of redox-sensitive proteins, especially the transcription factor NFκB (17Plumpe J. Malek N.P. Bock C.T. Rakemann T. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G173-G183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which on one hand allows the occurrence of proliferation by transactivating cell cycle genes such as c-fos and c-jun controlling the G0/G1 transition, and on the other hand, attenuates deleterious responses resulting from oxidative stress (e.g. activation of caspases by trans-activating the anti-apoptotic gene BclXL that prevents activation of caspases (18Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar)). NFκB also induces the mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP-2 (13Lee F.Y., Li, Y. Zhu H. Yang S. Lin H.Z. Trush M. Diehl A.M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and iNOS (19Diaz-Guerra M.J. Velasco M. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), both of which contribute to reduce oxidative stress (1Fausto N. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 19-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UCP2, an inner mitochondrial channel for protons, plays a major role in limiting production of ROS (13Lee F.Y., Li, Y. Zhu H. Yang S. Lin H.Z. Trush M. Diehl A.M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) by dissipating the electrochemical gradient. NO, whose production is enhanced by induction of iNOS, although it participates in lipid peroxidation (14Carnovale C.E. Scapini C. Alvarez M.L. Favre C. Monti J. Carrillo M.C. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 798-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), also exhibits a cytoprotective effect by preventing apoptosis through S-nitrosylation of caspases, which strongly inhibits caspase activities (20Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This last mechanism is most likely involved in liver regeneration because in iNOS knock-out mice, PH is followed by a strongly increased caspase-3 activity and hepatocyte death (12Rai R.M. Lee F.Y. Rosen A. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Koteish A. Liew F.Y. Zaragoza C. Lowenstein C. Diehl A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13829-13834Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Along with the TNFα-dependent activation of antioxidant defenses, it is worth noting that cytokine IL-6 and growth factors have also been shown to favor hepatocyte survival during liver regeneration through stimulation of anti-apoptotic gene products (21Teshigawara M. Matsumoto S. Tsuboi S. Ohmori S. Res. Exp. Med. 1995; 195: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,22Hayes J.D. Strange R.C. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 22: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In normal hepatocytes, an excess of ROS is also neutralized through the action of thiols, especially glutathione (GSH), of which the content is increased during liver regeneration (21Teshigawara M. Matsumoto S. Tsuboi S. Ohmori S. Res. Exp. Med. 1995; 195: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, glutathione S-transferases (GST) of the alpha class detoxify organic hydroperoxides and protect cells against oxidative stress (22Hayes J.D. Strange R.C. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 22: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For instance, transfection of hGSTA2 in K562 cells results in cell protection toward H2O2-induced lipid peroxidation (23Yang Y. Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Saini M. Pandya U. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19220-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The GSTA4 enzyme, the α subunit that exhibits the highest activity against 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) (24Jensson H. Guthenberg C. Alin P. Mannervik B. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Goon D. Saxena M. Awasthi Y.C. Ross D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 119: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), also efficiently protects against oxidative damage mediated by this cytotoxic product of lipid peroxidation generated by ROS overproduction (26Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Saini M. Singhal J. Piper J.T. Van Kuijk F.J. Zimniak P. Awasthi Y.C. Awasthi S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently demonstrated that ROS overproduction induced by hepatic iron overload is correlated with an increase in mGSTA4 expression (27Desmots F. Rissel M. Pigeon C. Loyer P. Loréal O. Guillouzo A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that GST enzymes could participate in defenses against oxidative stress during liver regeneration. However, to date, little is known about regulation of GST expression and activity during liver regeneration. Lee and Boyer (28Lee S.J. Boyer T.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have reported a decrease in mRNA levels of several GSTs at 12 h post-PH, whereas Mori et al. (29Mori M. Ishizaki M. Onda M. Nippon Ika Daigaku Zasshi. 1995; 62: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) have shown a higher expression of GSTPi after 2 and 3 days post-PH. To our knowledge, no study has attempted to correlate the expression of GSTs with the oxidative stress occurring during the first hours following PH. The aim of this paper was, first, to study the expression and activities of several GST subunits, including the mGSTA4 isoform, during the liver regeneration after a two-thirds hepatectomy in mouse. Then, we investigated whether oxidative stress, the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6, and growth/survival factor EGF, which are involved in proliferation and survival of hepatocytes during liver regeneration, may regulate the expression of mGSTA4 both in vivo and in hepatocytes in primary culture. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against a mGSTA4 peptide was characterized in our laboratory (30Desmots F. Rissel M. Loyer P. Turlin B. Guillouzo A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1573-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The other antibodies were purchased as follows: rabbit polyclonal anti-human GSTA1, GSTMu, and GSTPi antisera from Biotrin, Dublin, Ireland; rabbit polyclonal anti-cytochrome c from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; monoclonal anti-cytochrome c oxidase from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; monoclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and polyclonal anti-p44/42 MAPK from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA; anti-phosphorylated-AKT (Ser-473) from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; and anti-albumin from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Orsay, France; horseradish peroxidase-linked rabbit antiserum from Bio-Rad, Ivry sur Seine, France; and mouse and goat anti-rabbit rhodamine-conjugated IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Balb/c male mice (8 weeks old, Janvier laboratories, Le Genest, France) were subjected to 70% partial hepatectomy under ether anesthesia and were killed at various times post-PH. As controls, animals underwent a sham operation consisting of a laparotomy without tissue resection.l-N 6-(1-Iminoethyl)lysine dihydrochloride (NIL; Calbiochem) was injected intraperitoneally at a dosage of 40 μg/g of body weight in normal and hepatectomized animals 1 h before the surgery. Animals were killed 2 h after NIL injection. TNFα, IL-6 (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany), and EGF (Promega, St. Quentin Fallavier, France) were given intraperitoneally in 0.2 ml of sterile pyrogen-free saline (0.9% NaCl) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin at 40, 80, and 125 ng/g of body weight, respectively. Control animals received the corresponding sterile saline vehicle. Animals were killed 2 h after TNFα and IL-6 injection and 6 or 24 h after EGF injection. Mouse hepatocytes were isolated by the two-step perfusion procedure using 0.025% collagenase D (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) as previously described (31Guguen C. Guillouzo A. Boisnard M., Le Cam A. Bourel M. Biol. Gastroenterol. (Paris). 1975; 8: 223-231PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated hepatocytes were resuspended in Williams' medium E (Invitrogen) containing penicillin G/streptomycin (100 IU/ml), 1 mg/ml serum bovine albumin, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), plated at a density of 6.104/cm2, and maintained at 37 °C under atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. EGF was added at 50 ng/ml and TNFα and IL-6 at 20 ng/ml 24 h after cell seeding. Specific inhibitors Ly 294002, SB 203580 (Calbiochem), and U0126 (Promega) of PI3K, p38 MAPK, and MEK, respectively, were added 1 h prior to EGF stimulation at final concentrations of 15, 12, and 50 μm, respectively. Total RNA from cells or liver biopsies were isolated using an SVRNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Ten μg of total RNA from each sample were used for Northern blot analysis. Blots were hybridized with the corresponding 32P-labeled cDNA probe ([α-32P]dCTP, 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) at 65 °C overnight. Blots were washed at moderate stringency and exposed to radiograph films. The 18 S ribosomal probe was used as control. Cultured hepatocytes and liver biopsies were homogenized in lysis buffer (HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm, NaCl 150 mm, EDTA 1 mm, EGTA 2.5 mm, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, β-glycerophosphate 10 mm, sodium fluoride 1 mm, sodium orthovanadate 0.1 mm, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.1 mm, leupeptin 10 μg/ml, and aprotinin 10 μg/ml). CDK1 was purified from liver extracts using p9CKShs1 beads and recovered with sample buffer as described previously (9Loyer P. Cariou S. Glaise D. Bilodeau M. Baffet G. Guguen-Guillouzo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11484-11492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (12.5%), transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated further for 2 h in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and then overnight with primary antibody. Membranes were washed twice before incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h. Proteins of interest were visualized using the chemiluminescence reagent ECL (Interchim). MDA and 4-HNE levels were determined using lipid peroxidation assay kits (Calbiochem). Liver biopsies were washed in ice-cold 0.9% NaCl and sonicated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to ∼10% (w/v). Liver extracts were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected prior to determination of total protein concentration and the MDA and 4-HNE colorimetric assays. Liver mitochondria were isolated from freshly harvested livers by differential centrifugation in ice-cold H medium containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, and 2 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) (32Boitier E.

The purified pellets were suspended in 200 μl of buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm malonate, 0.1 mm oxoglutarate, and 10 mm HEPES. GST activities toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and ethacrynic acid (EA) were determined by spectrometric analysis (33Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar, 34Satoh K. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) of total proteins. GST activity toward 4-HNE was quantified using a high pressure liquid chromatography method as described previously (27Desmots F. Rissel M. Pigeon C. Loyer P. Loréal O. Guillouzo A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized and perfused through the portal vein with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 msodium cacodylate for 15 min at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Tissue fragments were washed in 0.1 m PBS for 4 h and in 10% glycerol-PBS overnight and were frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Frozen tissue sections were mounted on glass slides coated with 10% gelatin in PBS and incubated in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. They were then covered with a solution of anti-rabbit GSTA4 (1/100) or anti-rabbit cytochrome c(1/100) antiserum for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were washed with PBS, incubated for 2 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to rhodamine (1/200), washed, and mounted. Serial z-axis optical analysis of sections was done at 1-μm intervals using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Confocal Leica TCS NT). The rate of DNA synthesis was measured by incubating cultured hepatocytes with [methyl-3H]thymidine (5 Ci/mmol, AmershamBiosciences) at 2 μCi/35-mm Petri dish for 24 h. Cells were sonicated in PBS, and [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation was measured after DNA precipitation in 15% trichloroacetic acid. Two DNA fragments corresponding to the 5′-flanking region of the hGSTA4 gene (1571 and 165 bp upstream of exon 1) characterized previously (35Desmots F. Rauch C. Henry C. Guillouzo A. Morel F. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) were cloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. The pRL-CMV vector encoding Renilla luciferase and pGL3-GSTA4-(1–1571) or pGL3-GSTA4-(1–165) were co-transfected in 24-h cultured hepatocytes using cationic lipids according to Gilot et al. (36Gilot, D., Miramon, M. L., Benvegnu, T., Ferrieres, V., Loreal, O., Guguen-Guillouzo, C., Plusquellec, D., and Loyer, P. (2002)J. Gene Med., in pressGoogle Scholar). Dual luciferase assays (firefly and Renilla) were done using a Promega kit. pGL3 basic (a promoterless pGL3-luciferase construct) and pGL3 promoter (pGL3-luciferase construct with the SV40 promoter) vectors were transfected providing negative and positive firefly luciferase controls. Values were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used for the estimation of statistical significance. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The expression of the different GST isoforms was analyzed during liver regeneration over a 96-h period after a two-thirds hepatectomy of Balb/c mice. To ensure that liver regeneration occurred as previously described, the relative mRNA levels of the two cell cycle genes, cyclin D1 and CDK1, were analyzed. A clear induction of cyclin D1 transcripts was observed between 30 and 96 h, whereas the level of CDK1 mRNA was increased between 48 and 96 h post-PH with a maximal expression at 72 h (Fig. 1 A) as previously reported (37Albrecht J.H. Hoffman J.S. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G857-G864PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of mGSTA4, A1, and Pi mRNAs were augmented during liver regeneration exhibiting a biphasic induction of expression (Fig. 1 B). An initial increase was observed within 1 h post-PH, and mRNA levels remained high for 12 to 24 h. The second peak of induction took place at 40–48 h, and the increase in transcript levels was observed until 72–96 h. In sham-operated mice, mGSTA4, A1, and Pi mRNA levels showed a transient and moderate increase between 1 and 8 h post-PH but not thereafter. mGSTMu mRNAs were detected at very low levels, and no significant change was observed during the first 96 h of regeneration. mGSTA4, A1, Pi, and Mu proteins were further investigated by Western blot (Fig. 2 A). Expression of mGSTA4, A1, Pi, and Mu proteins exhibited a biphasic pattern as observed for mRNAs. The first induction occurred between 0.5 and 4 h after PH; mGSTA1 was very transiently induced at 0.5 h, whereas up-regulation of mGSTA4, Mu, and Pi remained elevated between 0.5 and 4 h. The second induction of the four GST proteins took place between 24 and 72 h depending upon the GST isoforms. In sham-operated mice, a slight increase of mGSTA4, A1, Mu, and Pi proteins was also detected at 1 and 12 h post-PH as observed with the corresponding mRNAs, which returned to control values thereafter except for mGSTPi, which remained elevated until 48 h. To confirm the induction of several GSTs, during the first hours post-PH, we measured GST activities using three different substrates: CDNB, a common substrate for mGSTA4, A1, Mu, and Pi; and 4-HNE and EA, specific substrates for GSTA4 and GSTPi, respectively (22Hayes J.D. Strange R.C. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 22: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). GST activities measured with CDNB, 4-HNE, and EA were all significantly increased between 0.5 and 2 h after PH compared with sham-operated animals. The induction of GST expression observed between 24 and 72 h was also correlated with a strong induction of GST activities using CDNB as a substrate (Fig. 2 B). The subcellular localization of mGSTA4 was analyzed in normal mouse liver using the indirect immunofluorescence technique and confocal microscopy (Fig. 3 A). A punctuated staining typical of a mitochondrial distribution was observed for cytochrome c whereas mGSTA4 exhibited both a punctuated and an intense homogeneous cytosolic staining. To confirm these results, mGSTA4 protein expression was analyzed by Western blot in the cytosol and mitochondria of normal or regenerating livers after cell fractionation. The reliability of the cell fractionation was demonstrated in cell extracts from normal and 24-h post-PH regenerating livers by performing Western blots of the mitochondrial cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase proteins, which were detectable mainly in mitochondrial fractions while albumin was observed only in cytosols (Fig. 3 B). By Western blot the mGSTA4 protein was detectable in both mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions from normal liver, regenerating livers 1 and 24 h post-PH, and sham-operated livers 24 h post-laparotomy (Fig. 3 C). The signal obtained in cytosols was much higher than in mitochondria and was increased at 1 and 24 h post-PH compared with normal and sham-operated animals. No change in mGSTA4 level was found in mitochondrial extracts during liver regeneration even after a longer exposure time of the blots (data not shown). During the first hours post-PH, ROS are produced in mitochondria (13Lee F.Y., Li, Y. Zhu H. Yang S. Lin H.Z. Trush M. Diehl A.M. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), although NO is released. These compounds contribute to enhanced lipid peroxidation (14Carnovale C.E. Scapini C. Alvarez M.L. Favre C. Monti J. Carrillo M.C. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 798-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To determine whether 4-HNE and MDA, two metabolites known to induce GSTA4 (38Tjalkens R.B. Luckey S.W. Kroll D.J. Petersen D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), could be responsible for the early induction of mGSTA4 following PH, the levels of 4-HNE and MDA, were measured in 1-h regenerating livers, and found to be increased by a 3-fold factor (p < 0.001) when compared with normal (Fig. 4 A) or sham-operated animals (data not shown). We also measured lipid peroxidation by analyzing 4-HNE/MDA levels and mGSTA4 expression by Western blot in mice injected with the selective inhibitor of iNOS,l-N 6-(1-Iminoethyl)lysine dihydrochloride, which blocked the rise of NO production and lipid peroxidation in hepatectomized liver (14Carnovale C.E. Scapini C. Alvarez M.L. Favre C. Monti J. Carrillo M.C. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 798-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The level of lipid peroxidation was strongly decreased in both nonhepatectomized (25-fold;p < 0.01) and 1-h regenerating (3.9-fold;p < 0.001) livers of NIL-treated mice when compared with normal and hepatectomized animals that had not been injected with NIL, respectively (Fig. 4 A). The levels of mGSTA4 were not affected by NIL treatment in regenerating liver, whereas in normal liver, injection of NIL increased mGSTA4 expression (Fig. 4 B). These results therefore favor the conclusion"
https://openalex.org/W2019323637,"HeLa cells infected with influenza A virus undergo typical caspase-dependent apoptosis and are efficiently phagocytosed by mouse peritoneal macrophages in a manner mediated by the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine, which is translocated to the surface of virus-infected cells during apoptosis. However, the extent of phagocytosis is not always parallel with the level of phosphatidylserine externalization. Here we examined the involvement of influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) in efficient phagocytosis of virus-infected cells. HeLa cells infected with an influenza virus strain expressing temperature-sensitive NA underwent apoptosis and produced viral proteins, including the defective NA, at a non-permissive temperature to almost the same extent as cells infected with the wild-type virus. The cells were, however, phagocytosed by macrophages with reduced efficiency. In addition, phagocytosis of cells infected with the wild-type virus was severely inhibited when the cells had been maintained in the presence of the NA inhibitor zanamivir. On the other hand, the binding of sialic acid-recognizing lectins to the cell surface declined after infection with the wild-type virus. The decrease in the extent of lectin binding was greatly attenuated when cells were infected with the mutant virus or when wild-type virus-infected cells were maintained in the presence of zanamivir. These results indicate that sugar chains are desialylated by NA at the surface of virus-infected cells. We conclude that the presence of both phosphatidylserine and asialoglycomoieties on the cell surface is required for efficient phagocytosis of influenza virus-infected cells by macrophages.

We conclude that the presence of both phosphatidylserine and asialoglycomoieties on the cell surface is required for efficient phagocytosis of influenza virus-infected cells by macrophages. Cells undergoing apoptosis are selectively and rapidly eliminated from the organism by phagocytosis (1Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev.

PS is normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer (10Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 11Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Mol. Membr.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although the externalization of PS seems to occur in many types of apoptotic cells, the presence of other phagocytosis markers that may cooperate with PS in phagocyte recognition of apoptotic cells has been proposed (12Pradhan D.

Cells infected with influenza A virus undergo typical apoptosis that has been considered to be caused by Fas ligand and Fas, the expression of which is simultaneously stimulated upon viral infection (18Takizawa T.

Hiscox S.A. Smith H. Sweet C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), nonstructural protein 1 (23Schultz-Cherry S. Dybdahl-Sissoko N. Neumann G. Kawaoka Y.

Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) in the regulation of apoptosis in influenza virus-infected cells has also been reported, although the mode of action of nonstructural protein 1 is controversial. Influenza virus-infected HeLa cells become susceptible to apoptosis-dependent phagocytosis by mouse peritoneal macrophages, and the phagocytic clearance of virus-infected cells appears to inhibit the expansion of viral infection (26Fujimoto I. Pan J. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3399-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It can thus reasonably be presumed that apoptosis of influenza virus-infected cells leads to elimination of the virus from the organism. We previously showed that macrophages recognized PS that was expressed at the surface of influenza virus-infected cells during apoptosis, but the extent of phagocytosis continued to increase even after the level of cell surface PS reached a maximum (27Shiratsuchi A. Kaido M. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9240-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This indicates that PS is not solely responsible for the recognition of influenza virus-infected cells by macrophages. We therefore decided to search for other surface change(s) needed for efficient phagocytosis of virus-infected cells. Influenza virus-infected cells express viral envelope proteins on their surface, and these proteins might participate in the recognition and phagocytosis of the cells by macrophages. We first examined the involvement of NA, one of the envelope proteins, because NA inhibitors and a mutant influenza virus strain with defective NA were available. The strains of influenza A virus used in this study were derivatives of influenza A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) virus, clones SP626 (wild type) and ICRC282 (a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant). Clone ICRC282, which produces ts NA (28Shimizu K. Mullinix M.G. Murphy B.R. Chanock R.M. Bishop D.H. Compans R.W. The Replication of Negative Strand Viruses. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1981: 369-378Google Scholar, 29Shimizu K. Aihara K. Miyamoto T. Compans R.W. Bishop D.H. Segmented Negative Strand Viruses. Academic Press, New York1984: 387-394Crossref Google Scholar), was obtained by mutagenizing the wild-type virus with the acridine-based compound ICR 191, as described previously (30Shimizu K.

Virology. 1982; 117: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For virus adsorption, HeLa S3 cells maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing either the wild-type or the ts mutant virus at a multiplicity of infection of one at room temperature for 30 min, as described previously (20Wada N.

Nakanishi Y. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For control “mock” infection, cells were similarly treated with PBS alone. Those cells were then cultured at 40 °C, a non-permissive temperature for the ts NA, in 5% CO2, 95% air and used for further analyses. In some experiments, cells infected with the wild-type influenza virus were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air in the presence of 10 μm zanamivir (4-guanidino-2,4-dideoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid) (a gift from GlaxoSmithKline), a specific inhibitor of NA (32von Itzstein M., Wu, W.-Y.

Nature. 1993; 363: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar), and then further analyzed. All culturing was done in the absence of trypsin to avoid secondary infection by the replicated virus. The growth of influenza virus in HeLa cells was monitored by examining the production of viral proteins by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. For immunohistochemistry, virus-infected cells were maintained in poly-d-Lys-coated culture containers, fixed, and permeabilized as described previously (26Fujimoto I. Pan J. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3399-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with an anti-influenza virus antiserum, which recognizes nucleoprotein (NP), matrix protein-1, hemagglutinin (HA), and NA (33Shimizu K. Mukaigawa J. Oguro M. Ono Y. Nakajima K. Kida H. Vaccine. 1985; 3: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and then with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (Vector, Burlingame, CA). The cells were examined by fluorescence and phase-contrast microscopy (BX50 microscope; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For Western blotting, virus-infected cells were lysed with a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.5% SDS, and 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and the lysates were separated by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% dry skim milk, incubated with the anti-influenza antiserum in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, and 5% dry skim milk, washed, reacted with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (Bio-Rad), and subjected to a chemiluminescence reaction using the Immun-Star system (Bio-Rad). The signals were assessed using Fluor-S MAX (Bio-Rad). The integrity of the plasma membrane and the occurrence of chromatin condensation were determined by examination under a microscope after staining cells with trypan blue and Hoechst 33342, respectively (27Shiratsuchi A. Kaido M. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9240-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 34Shiratsuchi A. Osada S. Kanazawa S. Nakanishi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The number of cells negative for trypan blue staining or having condensed chromatin was determined and expressed (in percentage) relative to the total number of cells. Translocation of PS from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane was assessed by flow cytometry using annexin V, which specifically binds to PS, as described previously (35Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Green D.R. Cotton Y.G. Martin S.J. Techniques in Apoptosis: A User's Guide. Portland Press, London1996: 107-119Google Scholar). In brief, cells were treated with FITC- or 5-carboxyfluorescein-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide, a membrane-impermeable fluorochrome, and analyzed in a flow cytometer (EPICS-XL; Coulter, Hialeah, FL). The cells that were less intensely stained with propidium iodide and thus impermeable to annexin V were gated and analyzed for the amount of bound annexin V. The activity of NA was determined using a colorimetric assay with fetuin as the substrate (37Aminoff D. Biochem. J. 1961; 81: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar, 38Shimizu K. Shimizu Y.K. Kohama T. Ishida N. Virology. 1974; 62: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, virus- or mock-infected HeLa cells (2 × 106) were suspended in 40 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.6) containing 4 mg/ml fetuin (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Sialic acids released from fetuin were brought to the coloring reaction, and their amounts were determined by measuring the A549. Either the wild-type or the NA mutant influenza virus was adsorbed to 1 × 106HeLa cells at a multiplicity of infection of 10 as described above, and the infected cells were maintained at 40 °C for 6 h. They were then incubated with 3H-labeled glucosamine (d-[1,6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride, 49 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (40 μCi/ml) in serum-free medium at 40 °C for 30 min. The cells were harvested using a cell scraper, suspended in the buffer used to lyse cells for Western blotting, heated at 50 °C for 10 min, lysed by passage through a 26-gauge needle 15 times, and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed with a solution of 20% methanol and 5% acetic acid, treated with ENHANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and autoradiographed. Macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal cavity of thioglycolate-treated BDF1 mice (females, 8–12 weeks old) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C until use, as described previously (34Shiratsuchi A. Osada S. Kanazawa S. Nakanishi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 39Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar). The phagocytosis assay was performed essentially as described (27Shiratsuchi A. Kaido M. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9240-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 40Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells infected with influenza virus were labeled with biotin (NHS-LC-Biotin; Pierce), mixed with macrophages (at a ratio of three target cells to one macrophage), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cell mixture was then treated with trypsin (0.5 μg/ml) to remove HeLa cells free from or lightly attached to macrophages. The remaining cells were fixed, permeabilized, and supplemented with FITC-conjugated avidin (fluorescein-avidin D; Vector Laboratories). The number of macrophages containing engulfed cells was determined by fluorescence and phase-contrast microscopy and expressed relative to the total number of macrophages; this ratio (in percentage) was termed the phagocytic index. The means ± S. D. of a typical example from at least three independent experiments are presented. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student's t test. Phospholipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were dried as films, suspended in PBS, and sonicated (40Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Liposomes were formed using either phosphatidylcholine only (PC liposomes) or a combination of phosphatidylcholine and PS at a molar ratio of 7:3 (PS liposomes). Either the wild-type or the NA mutant influenza virus was adsorbed to 2 × 106 HeLa cells at a multiplicity of infection of 1 as described above, and the infected cells were maintained in serum-free medium at 40 °C for 16 h. To examine the effects of zanamivir, the entire process of virus adsorption (wild type) and culturing (at 37 °C for 20 h) of the virus-infected cells was done in the presence of the drug (10 μm). The cells were suspended in PBS containing FITC-labeled lectin (Honen, Tokyo, Japan) (20–30 μg/ml) and propidium iodide and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were then washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. The cells less intensely stained with propidium iodide were gated and analyzed for the amount of bound FITC-lectins. The lectins used in this study were wheat germ agglutinin, which recognizes (GlcNAc)2, (GlcNAc)3, and Neu5Ac; Maackia amurensis lectin, which recognizes Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc; and Sambucus sieboldiana lectin, which recognizes Neu5Acα2–3Gal and Neu5Acα2–6GalNAc. HeLa cells that had been infected with either the wild-type or the ts mutant influenza virus were cultured at a non-permissive temperature (40 °C) for various lengths of time and assayed for NA activity (Fig. 1 A). The NA activity in cells infected with the wild-type virus continued to increase during the culture reaching a maximum level at 24 h. In contrast, cells infected with the mutant virus showed only the basal level of activity throughout the culture period, as did mock-infected cells (data not shown). However, we found no significant difference in the NA activity between cells infected with the wild-type and the mutant viruses when they were cultured at 34 °C, a permissive temperature (data not shown). All these results agreed well with our previous observations (28Shimizu K. Mullinix M.G. Murphy B.R. Chanock R.M. Bishop D.H. Compans R.W. The Replication of Negative Strand Viruses. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1981: 369-378Google Scholar, 29Shimizu K. Aihara K. Miyamoto T. Compans R.W. Bishop D.H. Segmented Negative Strand Viruses. Academic Press, New York1984: 387-394Crossref Google Scholar). We then used immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to examine the growth of the mutant virus by detecting viral proteins. When cells cultured at 40 °C for 16 h after virus adsorption were examined immunohistochemically with the anti-influenza virus antiserum (Fig. 1 B), the proportions of positive cells were 0, 45 ± 6.4, and 86 ± 4.2% with mock-, wild-type virus-, and mutant virus-infected cells, respectively. The proportion of positive cells was always larger with the mutant virus than with the wild-type virus. The signals were almost exclusively localized in the nucleus, whereas viral proteins seemed to be located in the cytoplasm when culturing was carried out at 34 °C. Virus-infected cells cultured at 34 °C showed nuclear signals at earlier times (data not shown). This indicated that culturing virus-infected cells at 40 °C delays the virus propagation compared with that in cells cultured at 34 °C. When lysates prepared from cells infected with the two virus strains were subjected to Western blotting, the overall pattern and intensity of the signals, which were absent in the lysates of mock-infected cells, were not significantly different between the two types of lysate (Fig. 1 C). All the above results indicate that the mutant virus with the ts NA grows normally in infected HeLa cells at a non-permissive temperature. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify the signal derived from NA, probably because its expression level was much lower than that of closely migrating NP. We thus radiolabeled glycoproteins to detect the glycoprotein NA, distinguishing it from unglycosylated NP. HeLa cells infected with the wild-type or the mutant influenza virus were incubated with3H-labeled glucosamine, lysed, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography (Fig. 1 D). Upon infection with influenza virus, the synthesis of cellular proteins is repressed, and proteins encoded by the viral genome are predominantly expressed. Two distinct signals with slower mobility were detected in each lysate, and these signals were considered to correspond to viral glycoproteins HA and NA based on their estimated molecular masses. The intensity of the signal derived from NA was almost equal in the lysates prepared from cells infected with either the wild-type or the mutant virus. This indicates that the ts NA is produced and glycosylated in HeLa cells as efficiently as the wild-type NA even at a non-permissive temperature and thus suggests that the defective NA is present on the surface of mutant virus-infected cells. We next examined the occurrence of apoptosis in cells that had been infected with the mutant virus and maintained at a non-permissive temperature (Fig. 2). Cells infected with either the wild-type or the NA mutant virus showed similar extents of loss of plasma membrane integrity (panel A) and condensation of chromatin (panel B). On the other hand, the level of PS externalization in the mutant virus-infected cells was slightly higher than in cells infected with the wild-type virus (panel C). These results indicate that the mutant and the wild-type influenza viruses propagate and induce apoptosis almost equally in HeLa cells at 40 °C. We then conducted phagocytosis assays with HeLa cells that had been infected with either the wild-type or the mutant influenza virus and cultured at a non-permissive temperature for 16 h (panels A and B in Fig. 3). The two cell populations used as targets of macrophages differed in the activity of NA but were at almost the same stage of apoptosis in terms of plasma membrane integrity, chromatin condensation, and PS externalization (see Figs.1 A and 2). HeLa cells became susceptible to phagocytosis by mouse peritoneal macrophages when infected with the wild-type virus, as reported previously (26Fujimoto I. Pan J. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3399-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, cells infected with the mutant virus were phagocytosed with reduced efficiency compared with cells infected with the wild-type virus. This indicates that virus-infected cells with reduced levels of NA activity were less efficiently phagocytosed by macrophages than those with wild-type NA. We then compared the PS dependence of the phagocytosis reactions using cells infected with the two virus strains. The phagocytosis of both cell populations was severely and specifically inhibited by the addition of PS-containing liposomes (panel C in Fig. 3), indicating that influenza virus-infected cells are phagocytosed by macrophages in a PS-mediated manner irrespective of the activity of NA. The above results indicate that the activity of NA in influenza virus-infected cells is needed for the efficient phagocytosis of those cells by macrophages. To further confirm this, we examined the effect of zanamivir, a sialic acid derivative that specifically binds to and inhibits NA (32von Itzstein M., Wu, W.-Y. Kok G.B. Pegg M.S. Dyason J.C. Jin B. Phan T.V. Smythe M.L. White H.F. Oliver S.W. Colman P.M. Varghese J.N. Ryan D.M. Woods J.M. Bethell R.C. Hotham V.J. Cameron J.M. Penn C.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were infected with the wild-type influenza virus and cultured in the presence or absence of zanamivir at a concentration that inhibits the NA activity (32von Itzstein M., Wu, W.-Y. Kok G.B. Pegg M.S. Dyason J.C. Jin B. Phan T.V. Smythe M.L. White H.F. Oliver S.W. Colman P.M. Varghese J.N. Ryan D.M. Woods J.M. Bethell R.C. Hotham V.J. Cameron J.M. Penn C.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). Treatment with the inhibitor did not alter the growth of virus, as indicated by the following observations. The proportions of cells positive for immunofluorescence with the anti-influenza virus antiserum were 100 and 99 ± 1.4% for cells treated and not treated with zanamivir, respectively (Fig. 4 A). We found no difference in the production of viral proteins in the two cell populations by Western blotting (Fig. 4 B). In addition, both cell populations appeared to be similarly apoptotic; there was no significant difference in the extent of plasma membrane integrity or chromatin condensation (data not shown). However, PS externalization seemed to be enhanced in the presence of zanamivir (Fig. 4 C). This, together with the result shown in Fig. 2 C, suggested that a defect in the NA activity leads to stimulation of PS externalization in influenza virus-infected cells. These results do not agree with those reported by other investigators who showed that apoptosis was inhibited by zanamivir (22Morris S.J. Price G.E. Barnett J.M. Hiscox S.A. Smith H. Sweet C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear at present but could be due to the difference in the host cell strains used in the two studies; influenza virus propagates more actively in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells used by Morris et al. (22Morris S.J. Price G.E. Barnett J.M. Hiscox S.A. Smith H. Sweet C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) than in HeLa cells. When the cells were subjected to the phagocytosis assay, macrophages engulfed zanamivir-treated cells to a lesser extent than untreated cells (Fig. 5). The inhibitory effect was not observed when the drug was present only during the phagocytosis reaction (data not shown). Treatment of cells with another sialic acid derivative, 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Sigma), a weaker NA inhibitor than zanamivir (32von Itzstein M., Wu, W.-Y. Kok G.B. Pegg M.S. Dyason J.C. Jin B. Phan T.V. Smythe M.L. White H.F. Oliver S.W. Colman P.M. Varghese J.N. Ryan D.M. Woods J.M. Bethell R.C. Hotham V.J. Cameron J.M. Penn C.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar), caused a similar effect but only at a higher concentration (20 mm) (data not shown). These results indicate that NA needs to be active for influenza virus-infected cells to be efficiently phagocytosed by macrophages. All of the above results made us anticipate that NA modifies the structure of sugar chains at the surface of influenza virus-infected cells and that the resulting sugar moieties participate in the efficient phagocytosis of infected cells by macrophages. To verify this possibility, changes in the amount of sialic acid on the surface of HeLa cells before and after influenza virus infection were analyzed. For this purpose, the binding of sialic acid-recognizing lectins to the surface of HeLa cells was assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 6). The results clearly showed that the binding of three different lectins that recognize (though not exclusively) sialic acid was reduced upon infection with the wild-type virus (panel A). The decrease in the efficiency of lectin binding was almost completely cancelled when cells were infected with the mutant virus (panel A) or significantly weakened when cells were infected with the wild-type virus and cultured in the presence of zanamivir (panel B). These results indicate that the amount of cell surface sialic acid decreases upon infection with influenza virus in a manner dependent on the activity of NA. We then determined a time course of this event. Cells infected with the wild-type virus were collected at various time points and analyzed for the binding of wheat germ agglutinin in comparison with that of annexin V (panel C). The decrease in the efficiency of lectin binding was first detectable as early as 3 h after the culturing started, and the level of lectin binding reached a plateau by 6 h. Essentially the same results were obtained using the other two lectins (data not shown). This change occurred much earlier than the externalization of PS, which became obvious at 9 h being maximized by 16 h. Because phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages reaches significant levels at 9 h (27Shiratsuchi A. Kaido M. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9240-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), surface desialylation by itself seems insufficient for phagocytosis induction. We finally examined the effect of exogenously added sugars on phagocytosis. Phagocytosis assays with cells infected with the wild-type virus for 20 h were conducted in the presence of Neu5Ac (0.01∼10 mm), GlcNAc (20 or 50 mm), Gal (40 mm), or Man (40 mm), but they neither stimulated nor inhibited the reaction (data not shown). This suggests that macrophages recognize not monosaccharides but more complex sugar moieties that are exposed at the surface of influenza virus-infected cells as a result of desialylation. Macrophages specifically recognize “phagocytosis markers” present on the surface of apoptotic cells using corresponding receptors (4Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar, 5Savill J. Brit. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 491-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Although a number of molecules have been proposed as candidate phagocytosis markers, it is unclear whether each marker functions independently or whether more than two molecules are simultaneously recognized by macrophages. PS, the best characterized phagocytosis marker, seems to be capable of inducing phagocytosis by itself in macrophages, because its surface expression independent of apoptosis makes cells susceptible to phagocytosis (34Shiratsuchi A. Osada S. Kanazawa S. Nakanishi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 41Fadok V.A. de Cathelineau A. Daleke D.L. Henson P.M. Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1071-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is also possible that PS cooperates with other phagocytosis markers to make apoptotic cells more effectively recognized by macrophages (12Pradhan D. Krahling S. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Schlegel R.A. Krahling S. Callahan M.K. Williamson P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Fujii C. Shiratsuchi A. Manaka J. Yonehara S. Nakanishi Y. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fadok, Henson, and co-workers recently showed that ligation between candidate phagocytosis markers other than PS and corresponding receptors led to the binding of macrophages to apoptotic cells, but engulfment did not take place unless the PS receptor co-existed on the surface of macrophages (15Hoffmann P.R. deCathelineau A.M. Ogden C.A. Leverrier Y. Bratton D.L. Daleke D.L. Ridley A.J. Fadok V.A. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). They have proposed the “tether and tickle” mechanism for heterophagic clearance of apoptotic cells; that is, two distinct receptors, which are responsible for the binding of phagocytic cells to apoptotic cells and for transmission of the signal to induce engulfment, are required (44Henson P.M. Bratton D.L. Fadok V.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R795-R805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that influenza virus-infected cells need to have both externalized PS and functional NA to be maximally recognized and phagocytosed by macrophages. PS most likely serves as a phagocytosis-inducing ligand that is probably recognized by a signaling receptor, i.e. the macrophage PS receptor (42Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A.B. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). As for the role of NA, it is likely that sialic acids located at the ends of sugar chains are cleaved off by NA, and the resulting asialoglycomoieties then act as tethering ligands. In fact, changes of the glycan structure by desialylation occur during apoptosis, and cells undergoing apoptosis are bound by the asialoglycoprotein receptor present on the surface of Kupffer cells (phagocytes in the liver) (45Dini L. Autuori F. Lentini A. Oliverio S. Piacentini M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 46Falasca L. Bergamini A. Serafino A. Balabaud C. Dini L. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that macrophage phagocytosis of influenza virus-infected cells was almost completely inhibited by the addition of PS liposomes at all times during the culture period (27Shiratsuchi A. Kaido M. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9240-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, we found in the present study that PS liposomes inhibited the phagocytosis of cells infected with the wild-type and the NA mutant virus to very similar extents and that loss of cell surface sialic acids by itself did not seem to induce phagocytosis. These results collectively suggest that the surface change(s) caused by NA act in cooperation with PS for efficient recognition and engulfment of virus-infected cells by macrophages. The extent of phagocytosis by macrophages continues to increase even after desialylation and PS externalization at the surface of influenza virus-infected cells are maximized (27Shiratsuchi A. Kaido M. Takizawa T. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9240-9244Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Other molecules should thus participate in macrophage recognition of virus-infected cells. Scott et al. (47Scott C.B. Ratcliffe D.R. Cramer E.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 351-359PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a monoclonal antibody, which recognizes another viral envelope protein, HA, inhibits the binding of human monocytes to Madin-Darby canine kidney cells infected with influenza A/WSN (H1N1) virus. A group of molecules bound by the collagenous C-type lectin called collectin are also likely candidates; phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by alveolar macrophages was specifically stimulated by the lung-specific collectins, surfactant proteins A and D (48Schagat T.L. Wofford J.A. Wright J.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2727-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It can thus reasonably be speculated that many kinds of molecules cooperate in the recognition of influenza virus-infected cells by macrophages so that those cells are effectively removed by phagocytosis before the infection spreads in the body. Influenza virus-infected cells are also phagocytosed by dendritic cells in an apoptosis-dependent manner, and this phagocytosis appears to lead to antigen presentation and activation of CD8-positive T lymphocytes (43Albert M.L. Pearce S.F.A. Francisco L.M. Sauter B. Roy P. Silverstein R.L. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 49Albert M.L. Sauter B. Bhardwaj N. Nature. 1998; 392: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar). We previously showed that phagocytosis of influenza virus-infected cells by macrophages results in the inhibition of virus growth (21Fujimoto I. Takizawa T. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that apoptosis-dependent phagocytosis of influenza virus-infected cells may protect the organism from viral invasion in two different ways. Further experiments are needed to examine whether such self-defense mechanisms against viral diseases really function in vivo. We thank GlaxoSmithKline for the gift of zanamivir, E. Nobusawa for suggestions on the NA assay, Y. Suzuki for suggestions on the use of NA inhibitors, and C. Fujii for help with macrophage preparation and flow cytometry."

The final maturation of the 18 S rRNA in the small 40 S subunit takes place in the cytoplasm (5Udem S.A. Warner J.R. J. Biol.

Linder P. de La Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The two ribosomal subunits are believed to be exported separately from the nucleus, and export involves the Ran cycle and specific nucleoporins (6Hurt E. Hannus S. Schmelzl B. Lau D. Tollervey D.

This process is accompanied by the assembly of ribosomal proteins on the successive intermediates in an ordered manner to generate the two ribosomal subunits. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, about 60 trans-acting proteins and 100 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in ribosome biogenesis. The snoRNAs are present in the form of snoRNA-protein (snoRNP) complexes in cells and can be divided into the box (C/D) snoRNAs, the box (H/A)CA snoRNAs, and the RNase MRP (11Tollervey D. Kiss T.

Depletion of any of these proteins or of U3 snoRNA leads to inhibition of the early pre-rRNA cleavages at the A0–A2 cleavage sites (in the case of Dhr1p, only the A1 and A2sites) and reduction of the synthesis of 18 S rRNA. Among the identified trans-acting nucleolar proteins, some are endo- and exonucleases and RNA helicases, whereas the role of others remains unknown (3Kressler D. Linder P. de La Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent NMR spectroscopy studies have shown that the first two N-terminal RBDs in nucleolin bind to an RNA stem loop present at several sites in the pre-rRNA, and it has been suggested that nucleolin may play a role as an RNA chaperone (33Allain F.H. Bouvet P. Dieckmann T. Feigon J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6870-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We have isolated and characterized a novel yeast gene MRD1(multiple RNA-binding domain).MRD1 encodes a protein with five consensus RNA-binding domains that is essential for viability. Depletion of Mrd1p leads to a decrease in the synthesis of 18 S rRNA and a decrease in the steady-state level of 40 S ribosomal subunits. Mrd1p associates with the 35S pre-rRNA and the U3 snoRNA. We have found that Mrd1p is required for the initial A0–A2cleavages during processing of the 35 S pre-rRNA. Mrd1p is the founding member of a conserved family of proteins found in all eukaryotes, each with multiple RNA-binding domains. The high degree of conservation suggests that the multiple RNA-binding domains play an important structural role in organizing specific rRNA processing events.

Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), was transformed using the NotI/SalI fragment of pS002 (see Table II; plasmids are described in the following section) containing the mrd1Δ1::hisG-URA3-hisG allele resulting in the Ura+ strain LWDY1. The URA3 marker in the mrd1Δ1 allele of LWDY1 was converted to LEU2 resulting in strain LWDY3. This was accomplished by transforming LWDY1 to Leu+ with a Hin dIII fragment from plasmid pUC4-ura3::LEU2 (obtained from Y. Kassir). LWDY1 was propagated on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA); strain LWDY5, with the unmarked mrd1Δ2 allele, was isolated as a ura− papilant. Correct insertion of deletion constructs was confirmed by PCR and/or Southern blot analysis. Strains LWDY3 and LWDY5 were transformed to Ura+ with pS001 and sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. Strains LWY001 and LWY003 are segregants obtained from these dissections, respectively. LWY001 was transformed with plasmid pS004, and His+ transformants were grown on media containing 5-FOA resulting in strain LWY005. Similarly, LWY003 was transformed with pS005, and Leu+ transformants were propagated on media containing 5-FOA to obtain strain LWY007.Table IIPlasmids and oligonucleotides Open table in a new tab The Gal+ strains were constructed as follows. Strain W1143–1B (MATα ura3–1 leu2–3,112 his3–11,15 met14Δ ade2–1 GAL2) (37Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) was crossed to L3906 (MAT a ura3–52 trp1Δ1 GAL2) (obtained from G. R. Fink). Strains PLY287 and PLY289 are haploid segregants from this cross. Strains PLY287 and PLY289 were crossed, creating diploid strain PLDY141. PLDY141 was transformed using the NotI/SalI fragment of pS003 containing the mrd1Δ4::HIS3 allele resulting in the His+ strain PLDY146. PLDY146 was transformed to Ura+ with pS001 and sporulated, and tetrads were dissected; PLY647 is a haploid segregant. PLY647 was transformed with pS006, and Leu+ transformants were propagated on media containing 5-FOA to obtain strain LWY008. Plasmids and oligonucleotides are listed in Table II. Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used for all PCR amplifications. DNA constructs were propagated in XL-1 Blue Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene). The MRD1 gene (ORF YPR112c) was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides MRD-p5 and MRD-p3 (Table II) as primers and genomic yeast DNA as template. The resulting fragment, containing 389 bases upstream of the initiating ATG codon and 474 bases downstream of the stop codon, was cloned into NotI and SalI restricted pRS316 (38Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the plasmid pS001. Precise deletion alleles of MRD1 were created in two steps. First, using genomic DNA as template, a 409-bp NotI/BamHI flanked fragment containing sequences immediately 5′ of the initiating ATG was amplified by PCR using primers mrd D-p5A and mrd D-p5 (Table II). In a parallel reaction, a 476-bp BamHI/SalI flanked fragment containing sequences immediately 3′ of the termination codon was amplified using primers mrd D-p3A and mrd D-p3B (Table II). After restriction with BamHI, these 5′- and 3′-PCR fragments were ligated and cloned into NotI- and SalI-digested pBS(KS)+ (Stratagene). In step two, either a 5.1-kb BamHI/BglII fragment containing the hisG-URA3-kanr-hisG cassette obtained from pSE1076 (39Allen J.B. Elledge S.J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or a 1.8-kb BamHI fragment containing HIS3 was ligated into the BamHI site between the MRD1 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, creating plasmids pS002 and pS003, respectively. An HA epitope-tagged allele of MRD1 in plasmid pS004 was created using a fusion PCR method (40Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) and primers HA-MRD-A, -B, -C, and -D (Table II). The construct contains the MRD1 promoter region (up to position −389) followed by an N-terminal HA tag and the MRD1 ORF. This construct was inserted in NotI-SalI restricted pRS413 (41Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E., Li, J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). Plasmid pS005 contains the MRD1 ORF, amplified by PCR using primer pairs MRD-GFP-5 and MRD-GFP-3 (Table II) using plasmid pS001 as template, inserted into NotI- and PstI-restricted pBFG-1/HA-GFP (42Yelin R. Schuldiner S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 426-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A PstI- and NotI-flanked fragment encoding N-terminal HA-tagged Mrd1p, amplified by PCR using primer pair Gal-MRD-5 and Gal-MRD-3 (Table II) and pS001 as template, was inserted into PstI-NotI-restricted B2202, creating plasmid pS006. Strain LWY005 was grown to late log phase and treated with 50 μg/ml Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku Corporation). Spheroplasts were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS buffer for 2 h. The fixed cells were dehydrated in 70% ethanol for 1 h and embedded in LR White Resin (London Resin) at 50 °C for 3 days. The thin sections were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 45 min followed by incubation with primary antibodies (anti-HA (12CA5), diluted 1:1, and anti-Nop1p, diluted 1:100) with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The sections were washed in PBS and incubated for 30 min with secondary antibody (gold-conjugated mouse or rabbit IgG, 6 or 12 nm, Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:20 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Sections were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde, stained with 5% uranyl acetate, and photographed in a Zeiss electron microscope at 80kV. The effect of diminished MRD1 expression was monitored in strain LWY008 expressing pGAL-HA-MRD1 (pS005) as described (43Hong B. Brockenbrough J.S., Wu, P. Aris J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm over a period of 36 h. Preparations of protein and RNA were obtained from cells harvested at the times indicated after the shift to glucose-based medium. For each time point, an equal amount of cells was used. Pulse-chase analysis of rRNA processing was done according to Ref. 44Kressler D. de la Cruz J. Rojo M. Linder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7283-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar. Briefly, strain LWY008 expressing pGAL-HA-MRD1 (pS006) was grown in SGal to an A600 of 1. Half of the cells were resuspended in SGal, and the other half were resuspended in SD medium, and the cultures were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. The cells were concentrated and pulse-labeled for 2 min with 250 μCi of [methyl-3H]methionine, (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and chased for 1, 3, and 10 min by addition of cold methionine to a final concentration of 5 mm. RNA was extracted using the hot phenol method (45Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.S. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Online. John Wiley & Sons, New York2000Google Scholar), and aliquots containing 40,000 cpm were electrophoresed through 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes, sprayed with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and exposed to x-ray films. Northern blot hybridizations were performed as described (46Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). For analysis of snoRNAs, 5 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed through 6% polyacrylamide-7M urea gels. The RNA was electroblotted to Zeta-probe membranes and probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides U3, U14, U18, snR11, and snR190 (Table II). Yeast strain LWY008 expressing pGAL-HA-MRD1 (pS006) was grown to early log phase (A600 of 0.4) in YPGal and used to inoculate glucose-containing YPD media. At the times indicated, cells were harvested and lysed with glass beads, and polysomes were extracted as described (47Pintard L. Kressler D. Lapeyre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1370-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Extracts from 50-ml cultures were loaded onto 10–50% sucrose gradients and centrifuged in an AH-627 rotor (Sorvall) at 4 °C for 5 h at 26,500 rpm. Fractions were monitored at 260 nm. For quantification of total ribosomal subunits, cell extracts were prepared according to Ref. 8Stage-Zimmermann T. Schmidt U. Silver P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3777-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar. Lysates from 25 ml of cultures were loaded onto 7–25% sucrose gradients and centrifuged in an AH-650 rotor at 4 °C for 3 h at 49,500 rpm. Analysis of nuclear extracts was performed essentially as described (10Trapman J. Retel J. Planta R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 90: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The extracts were centrifuged through 10–40% sucrose gradients in an AH-650 rotor for 2 h at 50,000 rpm. The fractions were analyzed by Northern and Western blotting. 35S pre-rRNA was detected with a probe representing part of the 5′-ETS, and HA-Mrd1p was detected with anti-HA antibodies. Yeast strain LWY007 expressing HA-MRD1-GFP (pS005) was grown to mid-log phase (A600 of 0.5) in 50 ml of YPD. Cells were washed and resuspended in 0.7 ml of lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2.5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A) and 5 mm of RNase inhibitor vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed by vortexing with an equal volume of glass beads (0.4–0.5 mm, Sigma) for 5 min. Aliquots of cleared lysates (0.5 ml) were incubated with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose and either 12CA5 or GFP antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Mock incubations to which only protein A-Sepharose was added were carried out in parallel. Eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Nop1 antibody and ECL reagents (AmershamBiosciences). To detect pre-rRNA, RNA was resolved on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels. To analyze snoRNAs, RNA was electrophoresed through a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and individual snoRNAs were detected by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes as indicated. We have recently identified a gene in the dipteran Chironomus tentans (CTE314912) called Ct-RBD-1 2P. Björk, G. Banrén, S.-B. Jin, Y.-G. Tong, T. R. Bürglin, U. Hellman, and L. Wieslander, in preparation. that contains six consensus RNA-binding domains. The presence of six RBDs is unusual, and Ct-RBD-1 appears to be involved in ribosomal synthesis and/or function. Based on sequence similarity with Ct-RBD-1, we have identified a gene in S. cerevisiae, ORF YPR112c on chromosome XVI, which encodes a protein with five RBDs (Fig. 1 A). We have named this previously uncharacterized gene MRD1. Mrd1p is comprised of 887 amino acid residues, and in addition to the five RBDs, Mrd1p contains several putative nuclear localization sequences. Computer searches identified Mrd1p homologues, each with a similar domain architecture, in Saccharomyces pombe (O13620),Caenorhabditis elegans (Q9XU67), Drosophila melanogaster (Q9VT19), and human (Q9UFN5). The S. pombe homologue contains five RBDs, whereas the C. elegans, D. melanogaster, C. tentans, and human proteins all have six RBDs (Fig. 1 B). To characterize the function of Mrd1p, we constructed a mrd1 null allele by replacing the ORF in one of the chromosomal copies of MRD1 with URA3 in the diploid strain HKDY8. Subsequent tetrad analysis showed a 2:2 segregation for viability, and no Ura+ spore-derived colonies were recovered, indicating that the MRD1 gene is essential. Microscopic analysis revealed that the mrd1Δ spores germinated, but cell division stopped after three to four generations. To confirm the essential nature of MRD1, the heterozygous LWDY3 strain containing one wild-type MRD1 gene and one disrupted allele marked with LEU2 was transformed with a URA3 centromeric plasmid (pS001) carrying the MRD1 gene under its cognate promoter. This strain was sporulated, and tetrad analysis showed that plasmid-borne MRD1 was able to support wild-type growth in the cells carrying the mrd1 null allele; Leu+ Ura+ spores were recovered at the expected frequency. To determine the intracellular location of Mrd1p, we constructed an allele of MRD1(pS005) that is under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter and that encodes a Mrd1p fusion protein with an N-terminal HA and a C-terminal GFP. The HA-Mrd1p-GFP protein complemented mrd1 null alleles and thus is functional. The HA-Mrd1p-GFP fusion protein is predominantly in the nucleus and excluded from both the vacuoles and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, in cells with the plasmid pBFG-1/HA-GFP alone, the green fluorescence was spread throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 C), consistent with previous reports (42Yelin R. Schuldiner S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 426-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As compared with DAPI staining (Fig. 2 B), it was evident that HA-MRD1p-GFP was present throughout the nucleus but that a more strongly stained crescent pattern was present within the fluorescent nuclei. This pattern suggests that Mrd1p localizes to the nucleolus. To more precisely determine the subcellular localization of Mrd1p, a functional N-terminal HA-tagged Mrd1p was expressed under its cognate promoter in the CEN vector pRS413 (pS004). The HA-Mrd1p was localized by immunoelectron microscopy. The immunolabeling was found throughout the nucleus including the nucleolus (Fig. 2 D). Little if any labeling was detected in the cytoplasm. Double labeling confirmed that Mrd1p is present in the nucleolus with an overlapping distribution of the nucleolar marker Nop1p (Fig. 2 E). Combined, our data show that Mrd1p is a nuclear protein that is enriched in the nucleolus. To determine the function of the MRD1 gene, we analyzed the effect of depletion of Mrd1p by using a conditional system for phenotypic analysis. The N-terminal HA-tagged MRD1 ORF was placed under the control of a galactose promoter (pS006). On YPGal, the pGal-HA-MRD1 allele complements the mrd1 null mutation in strain LWY008, indicating that the HA-Mrd1p is functional. In YPGal liquid medium, strain LWY008 showed a doubling time of ∼2.2 h. Following transfer to YPD medium, in which HA-MRD1 expression is repressed, the growth rate remained similar to that of control cells in YPGal for the first 12 h. Thereafter the doubling time began to increase significantly. After 30 h in YPD, the generation time increased to 6 h (Fig. 3 A). Concomitant with the decrease in the growth rate, the amount of HA-Mrd1p was clearly diminished after 6 h of incubation in the YPD medium, became very low after 9 h, and was undetectable after 12 h (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the expression level of Nop1p remained constant during growth in YPD medium (Fig. 3 C). The cessation of growth caused by reduced levels of Mrd1p was reversible. The viability of cells grown in YPD media for 20, 30, or as long as 40 h was examined. Around 95, 90, and 80% of the cells, respectively, began dividing again and formed colonies when plated on YPGal media. No colonies formed when cells were plated on YPD media. We determined the steady-state levels of rRNAs following Mrd1p depletion and found that the amount of 18 S rRNA was reduced dramatically, whereas the abundance of the 25 S rRNAs was not affected (Fig. 3 D). It is unlikely that the decreased steady-state level of 18 S rRNA was due to the effect of cell death because (a) at least more than 90% of cells grown in YPD medium were still viable at the relevant time points based on the cell viability test and (b) the 5.8 S rRNA levels were not affected (data not shown). Further, the levels of Nop1p did not change during the experiment (Fig. 3 C). These observations indicate that Mrd1p could have a direct role in 18 S rRNA metabolism. Since Mrd1p is located in the nucleolus and its depletion leads to a decrease in cell growth and a reduction in the level of 18 S rRNA, we explored the possible function of Mrd1p in ribosome biogenesis. In Fig. 4, it is demonstrated that depletion of Mrd1p leads to drastic changes in the polysome profile. As compared with the profile in cells expressing Mrd1p (Fig. 4 A), there is a gradual decrease in polyribosomes and 80 S monosomes with time (Fig. 4, B and C). Simultaneously, there is a decrease in the amount of 40 S ribosomal subunits and a relative increase in 60 S ribosomal subunits. The 40 S ribosomal subunit deficit was further examined by analysis of the total amount of ribosomal subunits (Fig. 4 D). The A260 60 S:40 S ratio for the LWY008 strain increased drastically after 24 h in YPD medium (Fig. 4 E). Taken together, these data show that depletion of Mrd1p leads to a decrease of 40 S ribosomal subun"

This process is initiated by the binding of a signal recognition particle to the ribosome/nascent chain complex, which then targets the protein to the ER. Here the ribosome associates with a large aqueous protein channel, the translocon, which is responsible for the integration of the membrane protein into the lipid bilayer. In the simplest case of cotranslational membrane integration, as each membrane-spanning segment (MSS) of the protein is synthesized by the ribosome it is recognized and retained by the translocon in its correct transmembrane orientation and subsequently is transferred laterally into the ER membrane. Thus the MSSs in the nascent chain act as successive topogenic signals, referred to as signal anchor and stop transfer sequences. For example, in the case of a membrane protein whose N terminus is retained in the cytoplasm, the first MSS acts as a so-called “type II” signal anchor sequence by inserting into the translocon in such a way that its N terminus remains on the cytoplasmic side of the ER, and its C terminus faces the ER lumen (Ncyt/Clum). The amino acids in the nascent chain that follow this signal anchor sequence are then extruded through the translocon into the interior of the ER as they are synthesized. This translocation process is subsequently stopped by the appearance of a second MSS that acts as a stop transfer sequence by associating with and being retained by the translocon complex in the opposite orientation to that of the preceding signal anchor (Nlum/Ccyt). The amino acids in the nascent chain that follow this stop transfer sequence will then remain in the cytoplasm until the appearance of a new signal anchor sequence. This series of signal anchor and stop transfer sequences thus determine the final topology of the membrane protein. endoplasmic reticulum membrane-spanning segment aquaporin enhanced green fluorescent protein peptide:N-glycosidase F proteinase K human embryonic kidney cells endoplasmic reticulum membrane-spanning segment aquaporin enhanced green fluorescent protein peptide:N-glycosidase F proteinase K human embryonic kidney cells Recently, however, it has been found that some polytopic membrane proteins do not appear to follow this simple cotranslational model of sequential integration of successive MSSs. Thus, for example, in some proteins there is evidence that the integration and/or final transmembrane orientation of certain MSSs requires the presence of more C-terminal sequences (4.Nilsson I.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the water channel aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is one of these proteins (10.Lu Y. Turnbull I.R. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Early studies of the transmembrane biogenesis of human AQP1 were carried out by sequentially truncating its cDNA at various locations and ligating the sequence for a reporter peptide to the 3′-end of the truncation mutants (11.Skach W.R. Shi L.B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These constructs were then expressed inXenopus oocytes or in the presence of dog pancreatic microsomes, and the location of the reporter peptide inside or outside of the ER lumen was determined by protease sensitivity. Analysis of these experiments indicated the presence of four MSSs in AQP1. However, a similar experimental analysis of the highly homologous protein AQP4 indicated the presence of six MSSs (12.Shi L.B. Skach W.R. Ma T. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8250-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as did topology studies of AQP1 utilizing antibody epitope insertion mutagenesis of the full-length protein (13.Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1668-1673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies have now confirmed the presence of six MSS in AQP1 (14.Ren G.

Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Recently, Lu et al. (10.Lu Y. Turnbull I.R. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have carried out additional experiments in oocytes and microsomes designed to reconcile the four MSS model obtained from truncation mutants with the crystal structure. On the basis of these studies (discussed in more detail later in this report) these authors have proposed that only MSSs 1, 3, 5, and 6 of AQP1 integrate into the ER membrane cotranslationally. This results in a structure in which MSSs 1, 5, and 6 are in their correct (final) orientations, MSS 3 is in an Nlum/Ccyt orientation, which is the reverse of its orientation in the crystal structure, and MSSs 2 and 4 are not integrated into the membrane at all, but rather located in the lumen of the ER and the cytoplasm, respectively. The final AQP1 topology is then attributed to a 180-degree rotation of MSS 3 to an Ncyt/Clum orientation, which pulls MSSs 2 and 4 into the membrane and translocates the extramembrane loops on either end of MSS 3 to the opposite sides of the bilayer. In the present studies, we have examined the biogenesis of AQP1 in HEK-293T cells. In contrast to the earlier results discussed above and the proposal of Lu et al. (10.Lu Y. Turnbull I.R. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), our results indicate that AQP1 integrates into the ER membrane cotranslationally in these intact mammalian cells. The mammalian expression vector, pEGFP-β, used in our experiments was constructed from pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) by ligating the sequence for the 177 C-terminal amino acids of the β-subunit of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase (a glycosylation tag) between the HindIII andEcoRI sites of pEGFP-C3. TheHindIII-EcoRI fragment of the β-subunit was taken from the vector M0 (16.Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr. George Sachs. Sequences coding for AQP1 truncation mutants were synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ligated between theBglII and HindIII sites of pEGFP-β using standards methods. The human AQP1 template was the plasmid pXβG-ev1 (17.Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr. Peter Agre. Each AQP1 truncation mutant began at the AQP1 start codon. Six of the seven truncation mutants studied here ended at the C termini of the six MSSs of AQP1 (Lys-36, Ser-66, Thr-120, Ala-155, Ala-183, or Asp-228) as identified in recent crystallographic studies (14.Ren G. Reddy V.S. Cheng A. Melnyk P. Mitra A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15.Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) and the seventh ended at Leu-164 close to the N terminus of MSS 5. The PCR primers were designed in such a way that each of the final constructs coded for a fusion protein consisting of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) followed by an AQP1 truncation mutant and the H,K-ATPase β-subunit fragment; expression of these fusion proteins was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter of the original pEGFP-C3 plasmid (Fig. 1). The resultant expression vectors are referred to as K361, S662, T1203, A1554, L1644, A1835, and D2286 where the subscript refers to the number of AQP1 MSSs included in the AQP1 truncation mutant. The forward primer for all the above PCR reactions was TGA GTA GAT CT C ATG GCC AGC GAG TTC A and the reverse primers were T GAG TAA GCT TCC TTT GAA GCC CAG GGC AGAfor K361, T GAG TAA GCT TCC ACT CTG CGC CAG CGT G for S662, T GAG TAA GCT T CC AGT CAG GGA GGA GGT for T1203, T GAG TAA GCT TCC AGC CAG CAC GCA TAG C for A1554, T GAG TAA GCT TCC AAG GTC ACG GCG CCT for L1644, T GAG TAA GCT TCC AGC CAG GAG GTG TCC AAG for A1835, and T GAG TAA GCT TCC GTC GTA GAT GAG TAC AGC for D2286, where in each case the nucleotides corresponding to the AQP1 sequence are shown in bold, the primers are parsed into codons, and theBglII and HindIII sites (AGATCT and AAGCTT, respectively) are underlined. HEK-293T cells obtained from ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (all from Biofluids), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in 10-cm plastic dishes in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and subcultured every 2–3 days. Subconfluent (∼80%) HEK-293T monolayers were transiently transfected overnight (19–24 h) with the expression vectors described above using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transiently transfected HEK-293T cells in a 10-cm culture dish were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (Digene) and then suspended in 300 μl of ice-cold TEEA buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 300 μm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF, ICN), 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, and 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin (all from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The suspended cells were then homogenized by passing four times through a 25-gauge needle. This material was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of TEEA buffer and rehomogenized and centrifuged as before. The combined supernatants from these two homogenization steps were centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min, and the resulting particulate fraction was resuspended in 50 μl of TEEA buffer, snap frozen, and stored above liquid nitrogen. (The protein concentration was typically ≥10 mg/ml, measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine IgG as the standard.) A membrane fraction was prepared from the above particulate fraction by an alkaline flotation step (5.Ota K. Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18.Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) as follows. An aliquot of the particulate fraction containing 50–100 μg of protein was diluted to 25 μl with water, and 25 μl of 200 mmNa2CO3 (pH 12.0) was added. This mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and then mixed with 90 μl of 2.5m sucrose in 100 mmNa2CO3. Next, 50 μl of 1.25 msucrose and 50 μl of 0.25 m sucrose, both containing 0.2 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), were overlaid on the alkaline mixture, and the tube was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge equipped with a TLA100.3 rotor. The 0.25 and 1.25m sucrose layers and the interface between the 1.25m sucrose layer and the alkaline mixture were recovered as the membrane fraction. In control experiments (not shown) we have confirmed that longer centrifugation times did not increase the yield of the membrane fraction. Kutay et al. (18.Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that >80% of ER membrane proteins are recovered in the upper phases following such a flotation step. Because plasma membranes are in fact less dense than ER membranes (19.Graham J.M. Dealtry G.B. Rickwood D. Cell Biology Labfax. BIOS Scientific Publishers, Oxford1992: 7-23Google Scholar) they are also expected to float into the upper phase. Aliquots of the above membrane fraction were treated with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England Biolabs) as follows. A 10-μl aliquot of the membrane fraction was diluted to 20 μl in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.5% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol (final concentrations) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Next, 2.22 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and 1 μl (1,000 units) of PNGase F were added, and this mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. In control samples PNGase F was substituted by its storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 50% glycerol). SDS-PAGE was carried out using 4–20% Tris/glycine Ready Gels (Bio-Rad), and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) by semidry blotting (20 V for 30 min) using a Trans-Blot SD Cell (Bio-Rad) and a transfer buffer containing 5.8 g/liter Tris base, 2.9 g/liter glycine, 0.37 g/liter SDS, and 20% methanol. Immunoblotting was carried out in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.9% NaCl, 4% skim milk powder (Giant Foods), and 0.04% Tween 20. (Tween 20 was omitted during incubation with the primary antibody.) The primary and secondary antibodies were a rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal (Molecular Probes) used at a dilution of 1:4,000 and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) used at dilution of 1:10,000. Incubation with the primary antibody was done overnight at 4 °C. Detection was carried out using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) and X-Omat AR film (Kodak). In preliminary experiments (not shown) we found that the signal from the anti-GFP antibody in Western blots was greatly increased if an SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing only 0.5% SDS was used, and samples were not boiled before electrophoresis. Accordingly these conditions were used in our experiments. We suspect that this increase in signal occurs because the anti-GFP antibody is more effective at recognizing the non-denatured form of EGFP, but we have not explored this phenomenon further. Quantitation of Western blots was done using a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer. Quantitative results shown are means ± S.E. for three or more independent experiments. Fig. 2 A shows a schematic representation of the transmembrane topology of AQP1 as determined from crystallographic studies (14.Ren G. Reddy V.S. Cheng A. Melnyk P. Mitra A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15.Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar); the locations of the end points of the seven truncation mutants used in our experiments are also indicated (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 2 B shows the initial four MSS transmembrane topology of AQP1 previously deduced from experiments carried out with truncation mutants expressed inXenopus oocytes and in the presence of dog pancreatic microsomes (10.Lu Y. Turnbull I.R. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11.Skach W.R. Shi L.B. Calayag M.C. Frigeri A. Lingappa V.R. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As already mentioned, in these experiments a reporter peptide (derived from bovine prolactin) was fused to the C terminus of the AQP1 truncation mutants, and its location inside or outside the ER lumen was determined by proteinase K (PK) accessibility. Briefly stated, in the experiments with Xenopus oocytes it was found that when AQP1 was truncated at residue Val-52, 67% of the reporter peptides were inaccessible to PK, indicating that MSS 1 was integrated into the membrane in an Ncyt/Clumorientation. However, when AQP1 was truncated at Pro-77 or Arg-93, ∼80% of the reporter peptides were still inaccessible to PK, suggesting that MSS 2 was not membrane-integrated. Furthermore, in truncations at Thr-120, Leu-139, and Pro-169, ∼90% of the reporter peptides were accessible to PK, demonstrating that MSS 3 was integrated into the membrane, but in an Nlum/Ccytorientation, and that MSS 4 like MSS 2 was not membrane-integrated. Experiments with AQP1 truncations in the loop between MSSs 5 and 6 and after MSS 6 showed that these MSSs were in their correct (final) orientations in the oocyte membranes. Hence the proposal (10.Lu Y. Turnbull I.R. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that AQP1 initially integrates into the ER membrane with the topology shown in Fig. 2 B. Similar conclusions were reached from the experiments with dog pancreatic microsomes. In their experiments, Lu et al. (10.Lu Y. Turnbull I.R. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) also examined the protease accessibility of a c-Myc epitope inserted into AQP1 truncation mutants at Thr-120 as a way of monitoring the orientation of MSS 3. In membranes from Xenopus oocytes these authors found that this epitope was more protected from digestion (indicating that MSS 3 had assumed its final Ncyt/Clum orientation) as more C-terminal AQP1 MSSs were included in their truncation mutants; more specifically, after 2 h of expression, the authors found that <10, ∼20, ∼35, and ∼48% of the c-Myc epitope was protected in mutants truncated after MSS 3, MSS 4, MSS 5, and MSS 6, respectively. They also found evidence that protection of this epitope increased with time after the synthesis of full-length AQP1, reaching a maximum of 78% protected sites within 5 h of synthesis. Smaller effects were seen in dog pancreatic microsomes (23% protection 12 h after synthesis). On the basis of these results and the authors' conclusions regarding the initial (cotranslational) topology of AQP1 (Fig. 2 B) they proposed that AQP1 undergoes a maturation step after the synthesis of MSSs 4–6 in which MSS 3 rotates 180 degrees from an Nlum/Ccyt to an Ncyt/Clum orientation. This reorientation pulls MSSs 2 and 4 into the membrane and translocates the extramembrane loops on either end of MSS 3 to the opposite sides of the bilayer. In our experiments we have also employed a strategy using truncation mutants to examine the biogenesis of AQP1 in intact mammalian HEK-293T cells. We have used the 177 C-terminal amino acids of the β-subunit of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase as our reporter peptide. This sequence represents a portion of the extracytosolic tail of the β-subunit and includes five consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (16.Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When this reporter is translocated into the interior of the ER it acquires ∼14 kDa of apparent molecular mass due to glycosylation (20.Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40471-40477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), an increase that is easily detected by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The use of this glycosylation tag in membrane topology determinations is now well established (16.Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19697-19707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have also included EGFP at the N terminus of our constructs for ease of detection on Western blots (Fig. 1). The results of our studies are presented in Fig. 3. In each of the panels in Fig. 3 A we show a typical experiment where the membrane fraction from HEK-293T cells, transiently transfected with the truncation mutant indicated, was treated with (+) or without (−) PNGase F (see “Materials and Methods”). These membrane fractions were prepared by incubating the particulate fractions from HEK-293T cells in an alkaline medium to strip away non-integral membrane proteins (5.Ota K. Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18.Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and then isolating the membrane fraction by flotation on a sucrose gradient (see “Materials and Methods”). Membrane fractions treated with or without PNGase F were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blotting to determine the extent of glycosylation of the β-subunit and thus its location inside or outside the ER lumen. Thus, for example, for membranes from cells transfected with the plasmid K361 we observed two bands in the Western blot of untreated membranes (−), a dense upper band of ∼56 kDa and a much weaker lower band of ∼44 kDa. After treatment with PNGase F, the upper band disappeared, and all of the immunoreactivity was found in the lower band, confirming that the difference in apparent molecular masses of the two bands was due to glycosylation of the recombinant protein. Quantitation of the two bands observed without PNGase F treatment (Fig. 3 D) shows that ∼90% of the AQP1 proteins truncated at Lys-36 were glycosylated, and thus that MSS 1 in these constructs was predominantly integrated into HEK-293T cell membranes in an Ncyt/Clum orientation. Thus MSS 1 has strong signal anchor activity. On the other hand, ∼50% of AQP1 proteins truncated at Ser-66 were glycosylated indicating that MSS 2 has somewhat weak stop transfer activity (Fig. 3, A andD). Extending the AQP1 sequence to Arg-93, the N-terminal end of MSS 3, had little effect on this result (data not shown). However, when AQP1 was truncated at Thr-120, most of the recombinant proteins (∼85%) were glycosylated (Fig. 3, A andD), demonstrating that when the first three MSSs of AQP1 are expressed together they are found to be predominantly integrated into HEK-293T cell membranes in their correct (final) orientations. These results are in marked contrast to those described above from oocytes and microsomes. Our data also suggest that MSS 2 is integrated into the membrane more effectively in the presence of MSS 3 than in its absence. One possible explanation for this result is that in the 50% of the cases where MSS 2 does not integrate into the membrane (Fig. 3 D), MSS 3 is inserted in an Nlum/Ccyt (reverse) orientation and then undergoes a 180-degree rotation as suggested by Lu et al. (10.Lu Y. Turnbull I.R. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To test this possibility we carried out the pulse-chase type experiment shown in Fig. 3 B. Here HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with T1203 were incubated with cycloheximide for 3 h to deplete the cellular content of recombinant protein. Cycloheximide was then removed, and membranes were harvested 1 h later to study the glycosylation of newly synthesized protein. In these experiments we found that 90.0 ± 3.2% (n = 3) of the recombinant proteins observed 1 h after cycloheximide removal were glycosylated. Thus this experiment provides no evidence for the presence of a transient pool of proteins with MSS 3 inserted in an Nlum/Ccytorientation. We also note that the proposal of Lu et al.(10.Lu Y. Turnbull I.R. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was in fact that the reorientation of MSS 3 occurred only after the synthesis of MSSs 4–6 (see above). Our data from intact cells could also be partially reconciled with earlier results if significant amounts of protein with unintegrated MSS 2 were produced in HEK-293T cells but then were rapidly removed from the membrane. (Such proteins might not be as efficiently removed inXenopus oocytes and not removed at all from microsomes.) However, when we examined the total particulate fraction from the experiments illustrated in Fig. 3 B (not shown) we found that 90.2 ± 3.5% (n = 3) of the recombinant proteins observed 1 h after cycloheximide removal were glycosylated. Because this particulate fraction includes proteins removed from the membrane and presumably destined for degradation we conclude that there is no evidence from this result for the preferential removal of proteins with unintegrated MSS 2. We conclude therefore that MSS 3 is able to assist in the membrane integration of MSS 2 in HEK-293T cells. This effect is consistent with observations from other proteins where a C-terminal MSS with a strong topological signal sequence was able to influence the membrane integration of more N-terminal regions (5.Ota K. Sakaguchi M. von Heijne G. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 495-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6.Lu Y. Xiong X. Helm A. Kimani K. Bragin A. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the case of AQP1, MSS 2 appears to be able to slip within the translocon before the appearance of MSS 3. The effect of MSS 3 may be caused by an interaction with MSS 2, which is sufficient to anchor MSS 2 in the membrane. Alternatively (or additionally), this effect may be a result of the strong Ncyt/Clum (type II) signal anchor activity of MSS 3 that constrains MSS 2 to the membrane simply because it is tethered to MSS 3. In any case, what is important to note is that, in this intact cell system, our results provide strong evidence that MSSs 2 and 3 of AQP1 are integrating into the membrane in their correct (final) orientations cotranslationally. Analysis of experiments with AQP1 truncated at Ala-155 indicates that MSS 4, like MSS 2, has somewhat weak stop transfer activity (Fig. 3,C and D). However, extending the sequence to Leu-164, which includes the highly charged region DRRRRD (amino acids 158–163), significantly decreases the glycosylation of the recombinant protein, indicating increased membrane integration of MSS 4 (Fig. 3,C and D). This result is consistent with previous observations demonstrating that downstream charged residues can act as powerful topological determinants (3.von Heijne G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 285-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23.Hermansson M. Monne M. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this case, presumably the highly charged sequence between Ala-155 and Leu-164 hinders membrane translocation of the nascent chain and thereby anchors MSS 4 in the membrane and the C-terminal glycosylation flag in the cytoplasm. Finally, proteins truncated at Ala-183 are predominantly glycosylated (∼90%) whereas those truncated at Asp-228 are virtually all unglycosylated (∼95%), indicating that MSSs 5 and 6 are sequentially integrated into the membrane in their correct (final) orientation. We emphasize that our results argue neither for nor against the existence of the maturation event proposed by Lu et al.(10.Lu Y. Turnbull I.R. Bragin A. Carveth K. Verkman A.S. Skach W.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2973-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); however, they do demonstrate quite clearly that this effect is of little relevance to the biogenesis of AQP1 in HEK-293T cells where AQP1 appears to integrate into the ER membrane cotranslationally. What then is the explanation for the differences in the way human AQP1 integrates into these various membrane systems? First, it seems that this protein is intrinsically problematic because of the weak stop transfer activities of MSSs 2 and 4 (Fig. 3). So folding difficulties inXenopus oocytes are not that unreasonable given the relatively large species differences involved. In this regard, it would be interesting to investigate the membrane biogenesis ofXenopus AQP1 in Xenopus oocytes. Note also that, despite any folding difficulties or complexities, significant quantities of properly folded human AQP1 can clearly be produced inXenopus oocytes as evidenced by numerous functional studies (24.Borgnia M. Nielsen S. Engel A. Agre P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 425-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Although the dog pancreatic microsome system has proven to be a reliable one for the study of many membrane and secretory proteins, it nevertheless is a cell-free system. As such it may lack or be deficient in some intermediaries in the membrane integration apparatus, and these may be particularly important for the processing of problematic proteins such as AQP1. Further studies will be required to identify these putative additional elements. The experimental system described here for the study of membrane protein topology provides a convenient and reasonable alternative to expression studies carried out with dog pancreatic microsomes andXenopus oocytes. To our knowledge this is the first use of intact mammalian cells for topology studies involving this now common truncation mutant approach. We thank Drs. Bruce J. Baum and Peter Agre for many helpful discussions during the course of this work."

We studied NO formation activity in reconstituted systems consisting of the isolated oxygenase and reductase domains of neuronal NOS with and without the CaM binding site. Reductase domains with 33-amino acid C-terminal truncations were also examined. These were shown to have faster cytochrome c reduction rates in the absence of CaM.NG -hydroxy-l-Arg, an intermediate in the physiological NO synthesis reaction, was found to be a viable substrate. Turnover rates forNG -hydroxy-l-Arg in the absence of Ca2+/CaM in most of the reconstituted systems were 2.3–3.1 min−1. Surprisingly, the NO formation activities with CaM binding sites on either reductase or oxygenase domains were decreased dramatically on addition of Ca2+/CaM. However, NADPH oxidation and cytochrome c reduction rates were increased by the same procedure. Activation of the reductase domains by CaM addition or by C-terminal deletion failed to increase the rate of NO synthesis. Therefore, both mechanisms appear to be less important than the domain-domain interaction, which is controlled by CaM binding in wild-type neuronal NOS, but not in the reconstituted systems.

However, for simplicity, this has not usually included the CaM binding site. Therefore, to further examine the role of CaM binding in catalysis, particularly its effect on the oxygenase domain, it was thought necessary to examine the catalytic properties of an oxygenase domain mutant including the CaM binding site. Conversely, most of the isolated reductase domains so far studied include the CaM-binding site to study the effect of CaM on the intramolecular electron transfer from FAD to FMN (16.Newton D.C.

The isolated reductase domain without the CaM-binding site and isolated C-terminal truncated reductase domains are also examined in this paper. The interaction between the oxygenase domain and the reductase domain is not clearly understood, despite its importance in controlling intermolecular/intersubunit electron transfer in the NOS enzyme system. The catalytic properties of the oxygenase domains (not including the CaM binding sites) of inducible NOS (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) in reconstituted systems with the isolated recombinant reductase domain (including the CaM-binding site) have been reported (21.Ghosh D.K.

Hitherto, no study of the neuronal NOS (nNOS) oxygenase domain in a similar reconstituted system has been reported. In addition, it is worthwhile examining how the CaM-binding site, CaM binding itself, and the C-terminal truncation of the isolated reductase domain affect the reconstituted system. Another interesting issue is whether or not native CPR purified from rat liver microsomes is able to support NO synthesis in the reconstituted system containing oxygenase domain of NOS. In the present study, we examined the interaction between the oxygenase domain of rat nNOS with and without the CaM binding site and the reductase domain with and without the CaM binding site. Reductase domains truncated by 33 amino acids at the C terminus (18.Montgomery H.J. Romanov V. Guillemette J.G. J. Biol.

NO formation activity was observed with the substrate NHA in a reconstituted system composed of the oxygenase and reductase domains with and without the CaM binding sites. Surprisingly, addition of Ca2+/CaM to the system markedly inhibited the NO formation activity of the reconstituted systems in direct contrast to its effect on the wild-type enzyme.

OxCaM and Ox protein were purified as described previously (12.Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30036-30042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The E. colicells expressing RedCaM, RedCaMΔ33, or RedΔ33 were suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μm H4B, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). The cells were crushed by pulsed sonication for 2 min (three times with 2-min interval) in ice using the Ultrasonic Disruptor UD-201 (Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 35 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650M (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) column (3.5 × 20 cm) pre-equilibrated with 0.1m NaCl in buffer A. The flow-through fractions were pooled and applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B (2 × 5 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. After loading the column was washed sequentially with 100 ml of buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl, 50 ml of buffer A containing 0.4m NaCl, and 50 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μm H4B, and 1 mm DTT) containing 0.1m KCl. The desired protein was eluted with buffer B containing 0.1 m KCl and 10 mm NADPH. Fractions containing the RedCaM protein were pooled and concentrated with an Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The E. coli cells were resuspended in buffer A. The cells were crushed on ice with sonication. After centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 35 min at 4 °C, ammonium sulfate was added to the resulting supernatant up to 40% saturation. The precipitate was collected and then dissolved in buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 5 μm H4B, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 10 mmimidazole. The solution was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (4 × 20 cm) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The eluted solution was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column pre-equilibrated with buffer C containing 10 mm imidazole. The column was washed sequentially with buffer C containing 10 mm and 20 mm imidazole. The Red protein was eluted with buffer C containing 100 mm imidazole. The protein fractions were pooled and concentrated. After concentration the reductase domains were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Before analysis, the buffer of protein was changed to a Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 μm H4B, and 20 μm DTT) using a Sephadex G-25 column. All purified nNOS enzymes were more than 95% pure, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The concentrations of the nNOS oxygenase domains were determined optically from the [CO-Fe(II)] − [Fe(II)] difference spectrum using Δε444–467 nm = 55 mm−1cm−1. The Δε value was estimated by the pyridine hemochromogen method (25.Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2105-2108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), assuming that one heme is bound to one subunit of the protein. Concentrations of the reductase domains were determined from the absorption spectrum, ε457 nm = 22.9 mm−1 cm−1 (18.Montgomery H.J. Romanov V. Guillemette J.G. J. Biol.

NO concentrations generated in the reconstituted system were fluorometrically determined as NO2 by using the NO2/NO3 Assay Kit-F (2,3-diaminonaphthalene kit) of Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). Unless otherwise indicated, catalytic assays were carried out at 25 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 μmheme domain, 0.5 μm reductase domain or CPR, 0.1 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm NHA, 5 μm H4B, 20 μm DTT, 10 units/ml SOD, and 100 units/ml catalase in the presence or absence of 1 mm CaCl2 and 10 μg/ml CaM. The reaction mixture without the heme domain was preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min, after which 0.1 μmheme domain was added to start the reaction. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by removing the enzyme with a membrane filter, Ultrafree-MC UFC3LGC (Millipore Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), with centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 10 min. NO concentrations generated in the H2O2-dependent system were spectrophotometrically determined as NO2− by using the NO2/NO3 Assay Kit (Griess method) of Cayman Chemical Co. (Cayman, MI). Unless otherwise indicated, catalytic assays were carried out at 25 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 μm NOS, 1 mm NHA, 5 μm H4B, 20 μm DTT, and 10 units/ml SOD in the presence or absence of 1 mmCaCl2 and 10 μg/ml CaM. The reaction mixture without H2O2 was preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min, and then 30 mm H2O2 was added to start the reaction. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 13,000 units/ml catalase. The NADPH oxidation rate was determined spectrophotometrically as an absorbance decrease at 340 nm, using the extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1 (25.Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2070579868,"The glycosidic linkage of sialic acids is much more sensitive to acid hydrolysis than those of other monosaccharides in vertebrates. The commonest sialic acids in nature are neuraminic acid (Neu)-based and are typically N-acylated at the C5 position. Unsubstituted Neu is thought to occur on native gangliosides of certain tumors and cell lines, and synthetic de-N-acetyl-gangliosides have potent biological properties in vitro. However, claims for their natural existence are based upon monoclonal antibodies and pulse-chase experiments, and there have been no reports of their chemical detection. Here we report that one of these antibodies shows nonspecific cross-reactivity with a polypeptide epitope, further emphasizing the need for definitive chemical proof of unsubstituted Neu on naturally occurring gangliosides. While pursuing this, we found that alpha2-3-linked Neu on chemically de-N-acetylated G(M3) ganglioside resists acid hydrolysis under conditions where the N-acetylated form is completely labile. To ascertain the generality of this finding, we investigated the stability of glycosidically linked alpha- and beta-methyl glycosides of Neu. Using NMR spectroscopy to monitor glycosidic linkage hydrolysis, we find that only 47% of Neualpha2Me is hydrolyzed after 3 h in 10 mm HCl at 80 degrees C, whereas Neu5Acalpha2Me is 95% hydrolyzed after 20 min under the same conditions. Notably, Neubeta2Me is hydrolyzed even slower than Neualpha2Me, indicating that acid resistance is a general property of glycosidically linked Neu. Taking advantage of this, we modified classical purification techniques for de-N-acetyl-ganglioside isolation using acid to first eliminate conventional gangliosides. We also introduce a phospholipase-based approach to remove contaminating phospholipids that previously hindered efforts to study de-N-acetyl-gangliosides. The partially purified sample can then be N-propionylated, allowing acid release and mass spectrometric detection of any originally existing Neu as Neu5Pr. These advances allowed us to detect covalently bound Neu in lipid extracts of a human melanoma tumor, providing the first chemical proof for naturally occurring de-N-acetyl-gangliosides."

Depending on the needs and predominantly on [Ca2+]o, mature PTH is packaged into either secretory granules for exocytosis or storage granules. Secretion of de novo synthesized PTH is believed to occur within 30 min of prepro-PTH formation (6MacGregor R.R. Cohn D.V. Clin.

Intracellular proteolysis of mature bioactive PTH has been reported to be one of the mechanisms by which parathyroid cells regulate the amount of hormone available for secretion in response to changes in [Ca2+]o (15Chu L.L.

Inhibition of these PTH-degrading activities potentiates PTH secretion, thus providing unequivocal evidence that PTH secretion is partly regulated by intracellular degradation of the mature bioactive hormone at the distal portion of the secretory pathway. However, this does not exclude the possibility that regulated processing and/or degradation of PTH precursors occurring early in the secretory pathway,e.g. by proteasome-mediated ER-associated degradation, might influence the overall secretion of PTH. In most mammalian cells, the proteasome, a multicatalytic proteinase complex, accounts for the degradation of short-lived and most regulatory proteins. An increasing number of its physiological targets as well as its mechanism of action have been uncovered in recent years either through the use of proteasome inhibitors (22Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L.

In these few examples, the proteasome has been demonstrated to directly or indirectly regulate the intracellular levels of the precursor proteins. In this study, the effects of peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitors and lactacystin on the fate of intracellular and secreted PTH and/or its precursors were investigated. We demonstrate that treatment of dispersed bovine parathyroid cells with proteasome inhibitors caused the accumulation of PTH precursors, a delay in the processing of pro-PTH, and decreased secretion of intact PTH. This was accompanied by overexpression of the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells, which may lead to enhanced interactions with the accumulating PTH precursors and retard their transit into or through the secretory pathway. These data suggest the involvement of parathyroid cell proteasomes in the quality control of PTH biosynthesis.

Except as otherwise indicated, equal numbers of acutely dispersed cells (2–5 × 107/assay) and MCF medium supplemented as described above with the Ca2+ adjusted to the indicated final concentrations (herein referred to as complete MCF medium) were used for all treatments. All incubations were carried out at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for the indicated times. To determine the effects of proteasome inhibitors on the fate of intracellular PTH/PTH precursors, cells were incubated in complete MCF medium containing 0.5, 1.25, or 2.0 mm Ca2+, the inhibitors at the indicated concentrations, or 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), harvested, and stored at −70 °C until required for use. Where necessary, the culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the cleared supernatants were preserved in aliquots at −70 °C. Acutely dispersed cells were preincubated for 2 h in complete MCF medium containing either 1.25 or 2.0 mm Ca2+. To observe the steady-state effects of proteasome inhibitors, the cells were rinsed twice with the same medium and resuspended in the same medium containing 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label, inhibitors at the indicated concentrations, and Ca2+ at a final concentration of either 1.25 or 2.0 mm for 5 or 20 h. At the end of the labeling, the cells and culture supernatants were harvested as described above and stored at −70 °C until required for use. In pulse-chase labeling, cells were pretreated with Me2SO vehicle (mock-treated) or proteasome inhibitors at the indicated concentrations for 60 min during methionine deprivation and pulse-labeled in complete MCF medium containing the inhibitors or vehicle, 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label, and Ca2+ at 1.25 mm for 30 min. Following the labeling, the cells were washed twice with the same medium supplemented with 0.1 mmcycloheximide in which the radiolabel was replaced with 0.2 mm nonradioactive methionine and incubated in this medium for the indicated times. At the end of each chase period, the cells and culture supernatants were harvested as described above and stored at −70 °C until required for use. Cells were double-labeled with Tran35S-label and a mixture of [3H]valine/leucine in the presence of MG132 (50 μm) in complete MCF medium containing 2.0 mmCa2+ for 5 h as described under “Metabolic Labeling.” The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described below using rabbit anti-PTH or control antiserum. The immune complexes were separated on 16.5% Tris/Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels (34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and blotted onto Hybond P membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride;Amersham Biosciences). After autoradiography of the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the autoradiograph was aligned with the polyvinylidene difluoride filter, and the two slowly migrating anti-PTH reactive bands in the MG132-treated cell lysates were excised for N-terminal protein sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer. The released phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid derivatives were subjected to scintillation counting. Treatment of cells for the assay of secreted intact PTH was performed as previously described (35Ridefelt P. Hellman P. Ljunggren O. Ljunghall S. Åkerström G. Rastad J. Gylfe E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Secreted intact PTH in the culture supernatants was assayed using a two-site immunoradiometric assay developed for the measurement of rat intact PTH. Routinely, the samples were assayed in duplicate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Immutopics Inc.) with the appropriate controls and standards. Cells were either exposed to different concentrations of Ca2+ for 10 or 90 min (acute treatment) or for 18–20 h (chronic treatment) or treated with proteasome or cysteine proteinase inhibitors or mock-treated with Me2SO for 90 min (as described above). Crude cell lysates as the source for parathyroid proteasomes were prepared by repeated freeze-thaw cycles as previously described (38Andersson M. Sjöstrand J. Karlsson J.O. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 69: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mmsucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The ATP-dependent proteasome activities were assayed in a 96-well microtiter plate with the fluorogenic proteasome substrates succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC and benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-AMC at 100 μm essentially as described (36Rivett A.J. Savory P.J. Djaballah H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 331-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Lightcap E.S. McCormack T.A. Pien C.S. Chau V. Adams J. Elliott P.J. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of the released AMC moiety was determined using an Amersham Biosciences Fluorocount-96 set at 365-nm excitation and 450-nm emission wavelengths. Fractionation of subcellular components was carried out by differential velocity centrifugation as described previously for parathyroid cells (39Habener J.F. Potts J.T., Jr. Endocrinology. 1979; 104: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of 25 μm MG132, 10 μg/ml brefeldin A, or 0.2% Me2SO vehicle for 20 h. The cells were lysed in equal volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mmsucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol by 50 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and unbroken cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 10 min, and the post-nuclear fraction was sequentially centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min and 105,000 × g for 60 min. The pellets obtained from these centrifugations (denoted P1, P10, and P100, respectively) were extracted in equal volumes of the immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (incubation with end-over-end mixing for 60 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min). The resulting supernatants and the cytosolic fractions (S100) were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-PTH antiserum, followed by electrophoresis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotting onto Hybond C-Extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and autoradiography or Western blotting as described below. Cells were pretreated with Me2SO vehicle or MG132 at 10, 25, or 50 μmfor 60 min and then labeled as described under “Metabolic Labeling” for 30 min. Cells were washed twice and permeabilized with 10 μg/ml saponin in cytoskeletal buffer (300 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8)) for 30 min at 4 °C as previously described (40Wassler M. Jonasson I. Persson R. Fries E. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Saponin-permeabilized cells were then washed twice with cytoskeletal buffer and incubated on ice for 60 min with 150 μg/ml proteinase K in cytoskeletal buffer with or without 0.5% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-PTH antiserum, followed by electrophoresis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotting onto Hybond C-Extra membranes, and autoradiography. Total RNA was isolated from dispersed parathyroid cells using the Promega SV total RNA isolation procedure, and mRNA was isolated from the total RNA using the Amersham Biosciences mRNA isolation procedure.In vitro translation reactions were programmed with either parathyroid cell mRNA or pre-β-lactamase RNA (Promega) using rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of canine microsomal membranes (Promega) and either Me2SO or MG132 at concentrations up to 50 μm. The translated proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotting onto Hybond C-Extra membranes, and autoradiography. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.26% sodium deoxycholate) and incubated by end-over-end mixing for 60 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and precleared with protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, equal volumes of the cleared lysates were mixed with 2.5–5.0 μl of rabbit polyclonal antiserum to bovine PTH or other primary antibodies where necessary and incubated by end-over-end mixing overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose was then added, and incubation was continued under the same conditions for 2 h. The immune complexes were harvested, washed four times with the same buffer, and dissociated by heating for 5 min in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 4% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue). Cell lysates or immune complexes prepared as described above were separated on denaturing gels and either processed for fluorography and autoradiography or blotted onto Hybond C-Extra membranes. For Western blotting, the membranes were probed with primary antibodies as indicated, followed by the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies according to standard procedures. The blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Where necessary, densitometric quantitation was carried out using a Fuji BAS-2500 phosphoimager to compare the intensities of the protein bands. The biosynthesis of PTH from its primary precursor, prepro-PTH, comprises two successive proteolytic cleavages, which occur at distinct compartments of the secretory pathway. To examine the effects of proteasome inhibitors on its biosynthesis, acutely dispersed bovine parathyroid cells were treated with MG132, PSI, lactacystin, or Me2SO vehicle in complete MCF medium containing Ca2+ at a final concentration of 0.5, 1.25, or 3.0 mm. Analysis of cell lysates to optimize both the incubation time and concentration of inhibitors was performed by immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal antiserum to bovine PTH, followed by Western blotting with the same antiserum. Treatment of cells with these proteasome inhibitors provoked the accumulation of slowly migrating anti-PTH reactive molecules. These effects could be detected following 5–20 h treatment of cells, during which the viability of the cells remained high (>95%) when incubated with the peptide aldehyde inhibitors at concentrations up to 50 μm(data not shown). Typical results from a 5-h treatment are shown in Fig. 1A. Compared with mock-treated cells (Me2SO), the three proteasome inhibitors caused the accumulation of anti-PTH reactive molecules (arrows) to different extents. Thus, MG132 was more potent than PSI, which in turn was more potent than lactacystin; and the effects of these compounds were comparable when cells were treated in medium containing 0.5, 1.25, or 3.0 mmCa2+. Previous studies have shown that the bulk of secreted PTH is synthesized de novo. It was thus necessary to examine whether the accumulating anti-PTH reactive molecules were nascent precursors. Cell lysates from [35S]methionine-labeled bovine parathyroid cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PTH antiserum and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fig. 1B confirms that prior treatment of parathyroid cells with MG132 or PSI (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) led to the accumulation of newly synthesized anti-PTH reactive molecules migrating with apparent molecular masses of 16 and 13 kDa. Compared with the mock-treated cells (Fig. 1B,lane 1), the accumulation of the 13-kDa molecule predominated in the proteasome inhibitor-treated cells. Similar results were obtained when cells were pretreated with these proteasome inhibitors for 60 min and pulse-labeled in the presence of the inhibitors for shorter periods (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1(A and B), molecules migrating with apparent molecular masses of 23 and 30 kDa (asterisks) were also enhanced in the lysates from proteasome inhibitor-treated cells. Likewise, in the metabolically labeled cells (Fig. 1B), a doublet corresponding to apparent masses of 70–80 kDa was consistently detected in the anti-PTH antiserum immune complexes, but these molecules also reacted with preimmune rabbit serum. To identify the major anti-PTH reactive proteins, parathyroid cells were labeled as described for Fig. 1B with [35S]methionine and [3H]leucine/valine in the presence of MG132 (50 μm). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PTH antiserum, and the immune complexes were separated on a 16.5% Tris/Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel and processed for N-terminal protein sequencing as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The radioactive profiles obtained by amino-terminal protein sequencing and identification of radioactive phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid derivatives of the accumulating 16- and 13-kDa anti-PTH reactive molecules in the MG132-treated cell lysates were consistent with the amino-terminal sequences of prepro-PTH and pro-PTH, respectively (data not shown). Because of its potency as well as the reversibility of its effects on the proteasome, MG132 was used in most of the following experiments. To examine whether the accumulation of prepro-PTH and pro-PTH was concentration-dependent with regard to MG132, parathyroid cells were labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of either Me2SO vehicle or MG132 at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 μm for 20 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-PTH antibodies, followed by electrophoresis and autoradiography. As depicted in Fig. 1C, the accumulation of pro-PTH could be detected at concentrations of MG132 as low as 1 μm (lane 3). Higher concentrations led to a dose-dependent accumulation of both pro-PTH and prepro-PTH. Thus, treatment of these cells with MG132 at concentrations ≥25 μm caused a >2-fold accumulation of pro-PTH and a >5-fold accumulation of prepro-PTH (Fig. 1C,lanes 6 and 7). Interestingly, newly synthesized PTH was present at all inhibitor concentrations, but the relative amounts decreased with increasing concentrations of MG132. Under similar conditions, treatment of parathyroid cells with up to 50 μm MG132 had little or no effect on the processing and/or post-translational modification (glycosylation) of chromogranin A as far as can be judged from the size and intensity of the anti-chromogranin A reactive molecule (data not shown). This suggests that treatment of parathyroid cells with MG132 or related compounds led to a dose-dependent accumulation of PTH precursors with a corresponding decrease in de novo synthesized mature PTH. The related cysteine proteinase inhibitors ALLN and ALLM efficiently inhibit calpains, which are partly responsible for limited proteolysis of mature PTH. ALLN has been shown to also inhibit proteasome activity, whereas ALLM has a relatively weak effect on proteasomes (41Vinitsky A. Michaud C. Powers J.C. Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9421-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These inhibitors were therefore used to further confirm that the accumulation of PTH precursors following treatment of cells with PSI, MG132, or lactacystin was due to inhibition of proteasomes. Thus, dispersed parathyroid cells were labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence of either Me2SO vehicle or the inhibitors for 5 h. Fig. 2A demonstrates that treatment of cells with the peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitors ALLN, MG132, and PSI (25 μm each) as well as lactacystin (20 μm) caused the accumulation of predominantly pro-PTH. MG132 at this concentration also provoked the accumulation of prepro-PTH, whereas the effects of ALLM were the weakest, in agreement with its mild effects on proteasome activity. Furthermore, assay of the ATP-dependent chymotrypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolase proteasome activities"
