https://openalex.org/W1533267071,"The incubation of dialyzed hemoglobin A with a number of phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates leads to the formation of covalent hemoglobin adducts that co-chromatograph with hemoglobin AIb. Phosphorylated hexoses (glucose-6-P, fructose-6-P, fructose-1,6-P2) and trioses (glyceraldelyde-3-P, dihydroxyacetone-P) containing a free aldehyde or ketone can glycosylate hemoglobin A nonenzymatically. From 7 to 12% of the hemoglobin can be modified after a 72-h incubation of an equimolar mixture of hemoglobin A and the phosphorylated intermediate. No significant formation of adduct was seen with a sugar alone (glucose, fructose) or glycolytic intermediate which had a blocked aldehyde (glucose-1-P, glucose-1,6-P2, UDP-glucose). The addition of an equimolar amount of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate reduced adduct formation. Evidently, the phosphate is needed to orient and stabilize the intermediate in the bisphosphoglycerate pocket of hemoglobin so that the addition reaction can proceed. All of the hemoglobin A adducts were indistinguishable form hemoglobin AIb by ion exchange chromatography and isoelectric focusing. The hemoglobin A-glucose-6-P adduct and hemoglobin AIb had a NaB3H4-reducible linkage in the beta chain. The concentration of hemoglobin AIb is elevated in patients with diabetes mellitus. This presumably reflects the increased concentrations of glycolytic intermediates (glucose-6-P, fructose-6-P, fructose-1,6-P2, dihydroxyacetone-P) which were found to be significantly elevated in the red cells of diabetic patients as compared with normal controls."

Specific steroid binding in intact cells was determined by a whole cell competitive binding assay. Non-phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes had about 2700 specific glucocorticoid binding sites per cell; phytohemagglutinin stimulation induced a 2 to 3-fold increase in glucocorticoid receptor activity within 16 h of culture. No estrogen, androgen, or progestin binding sites were detected in either unstimulated or phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Scatchard analysis of glucocorticoid binding was consistent with a single class of receptor sites with a dissociation constant (Kd) of about 5.5 x 10(-9) M (correlation coefficient r = -0.96). Significant competition for radiolabeled dexamethasone binding was not observed with steroids lacking glucocorticoid activity. There was good agreement between relative binding affinities of various steroids to glucocorticoid receptor in lymphocytes and ability of these steroids to inhibit phytohemagglutinin-stimulated thymidine incorporation."

https://openalex.org/W2006536169,"A GRADIENT of antibacterial activity along fronds of the large brown seaweed Laminaria1 runs opposite to gradients of density of bryozoans and spirorbid tube worms settled on the fronds2,3. Bryozoan colonies attached to a Laminaria frond grow towards the younger region4, where antibiotic production is lowest. It has been suggested that tannins produced by branch tips of Sargassum have an anti-fouling role5, but we have seen no other clear evidence of such an effect, although many marine plants and animals remain remarkably free from encrustation by other organisms6. We have now found further evidence in several examples of differential settlement by spirorbid worms on algae and by a bryozoan on another species of bryozoan."

https://openalex.org/W1491695357,"The three-dimensional structure of the protein myohemerythrin from retractor muscles of the sipunculan worn Themiste zostericola has been explored for the existance of approximately symmetry operators that locally interrelate portions of the molecule. First, the electron denisty distribution at 5.5 A resolution was examined. A local 2-fold axis that transposes the C-D helix pair into the A-B helix pair was found and refined by the method of least squares. The match in electron densities for a pure 2-fold rotation had a correlation coefficient of 0.56. Next, a comprehensive search was made for rotational symmetry in the Patterson function of an isolated molecule. The rotation function based on data to 6 A spacings showed a major peak, 72% of the self-peak height, that confirmed the result from electron density correlations. In addition, a pattern of lower level peaks revealed approximate point group symmetry as high as D4. Finally, the amino acid sequence has been inspected for evidence of a repeated structure. The level of amino acid identities between positions in the A-B and C-D helix pairs is 28%. Several factors are discussed to suggest that this homology, although low, is nonetheless significant."

https://openalex.org/W2057662734,"Neurons in the inferior colliculus of echolocating bats responded well to two stimuli presented in close temporal sequence. Favorable recovery of responsiveness was seen with stimuli having durations, intensities, and interpulse intervals similar to the natural biosonar signals reaching the ears during the various phases of echolocation. Some units responded to a subthreshold simulated echo but only when preceded by a loud initial pulse. These units appear to be specialized for echo-detection."

https://openalex.org/W1504620217,"A core-associated enzyme, designated as polynucleotide 5'-triphosphatase, has been purified from vaccinia. Fractionation on ADP-agarose of the soluble extract from detergent-disrupted cores followed by chromatography on poly(U)-agarose produced an 80-fold purification of the enzyme. The enzyme has an approximate molecular weight of 113,000 and is composed of two polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 90,000 and 26,000. Divalent metal ions are necessary for enzymatic activity, which occurs optimally at pH 8.4. The enzyme acts upon 5'-ATP- and 5'-GTP-terminated RNA and also on 5'-ATP-terminated poly(A), catalyzing the hydrolysis of only the gamma-phosphate. The presumed biological role of the enzyme based upon this specificity is the participation in the initial step in the sequence of reactions through which the primary 5' termini of vaccinia messenger RNA are capped with the groups m7G(5')ppp(5')NmpN-."

https://openalex.org/W1564288486,"Two subfractions of bovine thyroid plasma membranes, light membranes (L-membranes) and heavy membranes (H-membranes), were obtained by a discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation of plasma membranes. Electron microscopy of the plasma membrane and its subfractions showed that the H-membranes were very similar to the plasma membrane fraction, both contained junctional complexes, long membrane sheets, and vesicles. In contrast, the L-membranes consisted mainly of short membrane sheets and vesicles, and only a few junctional complexes. The H-membranes had greater adenylate cyclase activity which responded to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) while this hormone had very little effect on the enzyme activity in the L-membranes. Despite the marked difference in TSH stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in the H- and L-membrane fractions, specific binding of 125I-TSH was similar in both fractions. The L-membranes had higher specific activities of 5'-nucleotidase and Mg2+ATPase while (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and alkaline phosphatase activities were similar in the two subfractions. Protein kinase activity of H-membranes was not significantly stimulated by exogenous cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Plasma membranes and H-membranes contained a substrate capable of being phosphorylated. Such phosphorylation was slightly increased by addition of soluble protein kinase. The phosphorylation of exogenous histone by protein kinase of plasma membranes and H-membranes was augmented by cAMP. In contrast, L-membranes had very little protein kinase activity even when exogenous histone was added. They were not a very good substrate for cytosolic protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1562077752,"Antibodies elicited by purified calf thymus histone fractions are used to quantitate the immunological cross-reactions between calf and Drosophila histones. The index of dissimilarity between calf and Drosophila histones are: H4, 1.0; H2B, 1.0; H3, 1.6; H2A, 2.0; H1, 16. These values respectively correspond to 0, 0, 4, 6, and 27% difference in amino acid composition. The differences in amino acid composition assessed by immunological techniques are in agreement with values obtained by amino acid analysis (Alfageme, C. R., Zweidler, A., Mahowald, A., and Cohen, L. H. (1974) J Biol. Chem. 249, 3729-3736 and Oliver, D., and Chalkley, R. (1972) Exp. Cell. Res. 73, 295-302). The strong immunological cross-reaction between calf and Drosophila histones H4, H3, H2A, and H2B leads us to suggest that antibodies elicited against purified histone fractions derived from calf thymus can serve as universal reagents for various studies of chromatin-bound histones. The use of standard preparations of antisera will facilitate comparisons of results obtained in different laboratories with various experimental systems."

https://openalex.org/W1605728485,"Sucrose density gradient fractionation of isolated rat liver mitochondrial DNA ordinarily yields two peaks, one at 39 S, the other at 27 S. However, when these mitochondria are first incubated with a labeled DNA precursor, a labeled peak at about 8 S is also observed. Is this low molecular weight 8 S DNA merely an artifact of contamination or breakdown, or is it a functioning part of the mitochondrial genome? That it is not a nuclear contaminant is shown by: (a) the absence of nuclei or nuclear fragments in active mitochondrial preparations; (b) the insensitivity of 8 S DNA synthesis to treatment of mitochondria with DNase and RNase; (c) the ability of inner membrane preparations to synthesize this DNA; (d) the ability of atractyloside to inhibit incorporation of [3H]dATP into 8 S and 39 S or 27 S DNA equally; (e) the labeling of 8 S DNA (as well as 39 S and 27 S DNA) but not of nuclear DNA after the administration in vivo of [3H]thymidine. The evidence that 8 S DNA is not an artifact resulting from DNA breakdown during mitochondrial incubation or DNA isolation is as follows: (a) 8 S DNA can be isolated from unincubated mitochondrial; (b) 8 S DNA becomes labeled when labeled DNA precursors are administered in vivo; (c) 8 S DNA biosynthesis continues in the complete absence of labeled 39 S or 27 S DNA (whose synthesis is repressed by ethidium bromide), making it unlikely that 8 S DNA is formed from the breakdown of 39 S or 27 S DNA; (d) substitution of milder methods of DNA extraction does not decrease 8 S DNA labeling; moreover, the usual conditions of extraction, when applied to purified 39 S and 27 S DNA, do not generate 8 S DNA, nor does an additional mitochondrial washing cycle; (e) the specific radioactivity of 8 S DNA is higher than that of 39 S or 27 S DNA, making it improbable that the latter forms are precursors of 8 S DNA. Since 8 S DNA is double-stranded, it is not identical to the 7 S fragment of D loop DNA. The hypothesis that the artifactual nicking of those DNA molecules which contain opposing D loops leads to the release of double-stranded fragments was tested. The DNA which was released was predominantly (and probably completely) single-stranded. We conclude that 8 S DNA is probably not an artifact and studies are in progress on its function."
