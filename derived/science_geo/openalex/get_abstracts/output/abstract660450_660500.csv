https://openalex.org/W3091722552,"Brain atlases are fundamental to understanding the topographic organization of the human brain, yet many contemporary human atlases cover only the cerebral cortex, leaving the subcortex a terra incognita. We use functional MRI (fMRI) to map the complex topographic organization of the human subcortex, revealing large-scale connectivity gradients and new areal boundaries. We unveil four scales of subcortical organization that recapitulate well-known anatomical nuclei at the coarsest scale and delineate 27 new bilateral regions at the finest. Ultrahigh field strength fMRI corroborates and extends this organizational structure, enabling the delineation of finer subdivisions of the hippocampus and the amygdala, while task-evoked fMRI reveals a subtle subcortical reorganization in response to changing cognitive demands. A new subcortical atlas is delineated, personalized to represent individual differences and used to uncover reproducible brain–behavior relationships. Linking cortical networks to subcortical regions recapitulates a task-positive to task-negative axis. This new atlas enables holistic connectome mapping and characterization of cortico–subcortical connectivity. This work by Tian and colleagues unveils the extraordinarily complex layout of the human subcortex by identifying 27 new functional regions that organize hierarchically across four scales and adapt to changing cognitive demands."
https://openalex.org/W3090224263,"SIRT1 (Sir2) is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase that plays critical roles in a broad range of biological events, including metabolism, the immune response and ageing1–5. Although there is strong interest in stimulating SIRT1 catalytic activity, the homeostasis of SIRT1 at the protein level is poorly understood. Here we report that macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), a catabolic membrane trafficking pathway that degrades cellular components through autophagosomes and lysosomes, mediates the downregulation of mammalian SIRT1 protein during senescence and in vivo ageing. In senescence, nuclear SIRT1 is recognized as an autophagy substrate and is subjected to cytoplasmic autophagosome–lysosome degradation, via the autophagy protein LC3. Importantly, the autophagy–lysosome pathway contributes to the loss of SIRT1 during ageing of several tissues related to the immune and haematopoietic system in mice, including the spleen, thymus, and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as in CD8+CD28− T cells from aged human donors. Our study reveals a mechanism in the regulation of the protein homeostasis of SIRT1 and suggests a potential strategy to stabilize SIRT1 to promote productive ageing. Xu et al. report that nuclear SIRT1 is recognized as an autophagy substrate during senescence and also observe ageing of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W3089451699,"Protein aggregation is the hallmark of neurodegeneration, but the molecular mechanisms underlying late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unclear. Here we integrated transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic analyses of postmortem human brains to identify molecular pathways involved in AD. RNA sequencing analysis revealed upregulation of transcription- and chromatin-related genes, including the histone acetyltransferases for H3K27ac and H3K9ac. An unbiased proteomic screening singled out H3K27ac and H3K9ac as the main enrichments specific to AD. In turn, epigenomic profiling revealed gains in the histone H3 modifications H3K27ac and H3K9ac linked to transcription, chromatin and disease pathways in AD. Increasing genome-wide H3K27ac and H3K9ac in a fly model of AD exacerbated amyloid-β42-driven neurodegeneration. Together, these findings suggest that AD involves a reconfiguration of the epigenome, wherein H3K27ac and H3K9ac affect disease pathways by dysregulating transcription- and chromatin-gene feedback loops. The identification of this process highlights potential epigenetic strategies for early-stage disease treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3089440935,"Access to healthcare is a requirement for human well-being that is constrained, in part, by the allocation of healthcare resources relative to the geographically dispersed human population1–3. Quantifying access to care globally is challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive database of healthcare facilities. We harness major data collection efforts underway by OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and academic researchers to compile the most complete collection of facility locations to date. Leveraging the geographically variable strengths of our facility datasets, we use an established methodology4 to characterize travel time to healthcare facilities in unprecedented detail. We produce maps of travel time with and without access to motorized transport, thus characterizing travel time to healthcare for populations distributed across the wealth spectrum. We find that just 8.9% of the global population (646 million people) cannot reach healthcare within one hour if they have access to motorized transport, and that 43.3% (3.16 billion people) cannot reach a healthcare facility by foot within one hour. Our maps highlight an additional vulnerability faced by poorer individuals in remote areas and can help to estimate whether individuals will seek healthcare when it is needed, as well as providing an evidence base for efficiently distributing limited healthcare and transportation resources to underserved populations both now and in the future. A global analysis generating high-resolution maps of travel time shows that 91.1% of the world’s population can reach a hospital or clinic within an hour if they have access to motorized transportation, but only 56.7% can do so by walking, highlighting additional inequities for underserved populations accessing healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W3090734171,"Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the most important tuber crop worldwide. Efforts are underway to transform the crop from a clonally propagated tetraploid into a seed-propagated, inbred-line-based hybrid, but this process requires a better understanding of potato genome. Here, we report the 1.67-Gb haplotype-resolved assembly of a diploid potato, RH89-039-16, using a combination of multiple sequencing strategies, including circular consensus sequencing. Comparison of the two haplotypes revealed ~2.1% intragenomic diversity, including 22,134 predicted deleterious mutations in 10,642 annotated genes. In 20,583 pairs of allelic genes, 16.6% and 30.8% exhibited differential expression and methylation between alleles, respectively. Deleterious mutations and differentially expressed alleles were dispersed throughout both haplotypes, complicating strategies to eradicate deleterious alleles or stack beneficial alleles via meiotic recombination. This study offers a holistic view of the genome organization of a clonally propagated diploid species and provides insights into technological evolution in resolving complex genomes."
https://openalex.org/W3091490674,"22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a highly penetrant and common genetic cause of neuropsychiatric disease. Here we generated induced pluripotent stem cells from 15 individuals with 22q11DS and 15 control individuals and differentiated them into three-dimensional (3D) cerebral cortical organoids. Transcriptional profiling across 100 days showed high reliability of differentiation and revealed changes in neuronal excitability-related genes. Using electrophysiology and live imaging, we identified defects in spontaneous neuronal activity and calcium signaling in both organoid- and 2D-derived cortical neurons. The calcium deficit was related to resting membrane potential changes that led to abnormal inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels. Heterozygous loss of DGCR8 recapitulated the excitability and calcium phenotypes and its overexpression rescued these defects. Moreover, the 22q11DS calcium abnormality could also be restored by application of antipsychotics. Taken together, our study illustrates how stem cell derived models can be used to uncover and rescue cellular phenotypes associated with genetic forms of neuropsychiatric disease."

https://openalex.org/W3089543327,"Wild tomato species represent a rich gene pool for numerous desirable traits lost during domestication. Here, we exploited an introgression population representing wild desert-adapted species and a domesticated cultivar to establish the genetic basis of gene expression and chemical variation accompanying the transfer of wild-species-associated fruit traits. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis of 580 lines coupled to pathogen sensitivity assays resulted in the identification of genomic loci associated with levels of hundreds of transcripts and metabolites. These associations occurred in hotspots representing coordinated perturbation of metabolic pathways and ripening-related processes. Here, we identify components of the Solanum alkaloid pathway, as well as genes and metabolites involved in pathogen defense and linking fungal resistance with changes in the fruit ripening regulatory network. Our results outline a framework for understanding metabolism and pathogen resistance during tomato fruit ripening and provide insights into key fruit quality traits. A study of 580 tomato lines resulting from a cross between a wild desert-adapted species and a domesticated cultivar elucidates the genetic basis of gene expression and metabolite variation associated with fruit traits and defense against pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3090167646,"In addition to commonly associated environmental factors, genomic factors may cause cerebral palsy. We performed whole-exome sequencing of 250 parent-offspring trios, and observed enrichment of damaging de novo mutations in cerebral palsy cases. Eight genes had multiple damaging de novo mutations; of these, two (TUBA1A and CTNNB1) met genome-wide significance. We identified two novel monogenic etiologies, FBXO31 and RHOB, and showed that the RHOB mutation enhances active-state Rho effector binding while the FBXO31 mutation diminishes cyclin D levels. Candidate cerebral palsy risk genes overlapped with neurodevelopmental disorder genes. Network analyses identified enrichment of Rho GTPase, extracellular matrix, focal adhesion and cytoskeleton pathways. Cerebral palsy risk genes in enriched pathways were shown to regulate neuromotor function in a Drosophila reverse genetics screen. We estimate that 14% of cases could be attributed to an excess of damaging de novo or recessive variants. These findings provide evidence for genetically mediated dysregulation of early neuronal connectivity in cerebral palsy."
https://openalex.org/W3090410855,"In the basal ganglia (BG), anatomically segregated and topographically organized feedforward circuits are thought to modulate multiple behaviors in parallel. Although topographically arranged BG circuits have been described, the extent to which these relationships are maintained across the BG output nuclei and in downstream targets is unclear. Here, using focal trans-synaptic anterograde tracing, we show that the motor-action-related topographical organization of the striatum is preserved in all BG output nuclei. The topography is also maintained downstream of the BG and in multiple parallel closed loops that provide striatal input. Furthermore, focal activation of two distinct striatal regions induces either licking or turning, consistent with their respective anatomical targets of projection outside of the BG. Our results confirm the parallel model of BG function and suggest that the integration and competition of information relating to different behavior occur largely outside of the BG. This study demonstrates that basal ganglia functional topography is maintained across and downstream of its output nuclei, and in closed loops. Focal stimulation of distinct striatal subregions induces distinct action, supporting a model of parallel behavioral control."
https://openalex.org/W3090651146,"Epidemiological studies have identified many environmental agents that appear to significantly increase cancer risk in human populations. By analyzing tumor genomes from mice chronically exposed to 1 of 20 known or suspected human carcinogens, we reveal that most agents do not generate distinct mutational signatures or increase mutation burden, with most mutations, including driver mutations, resulting from tissue-specific endogenous processes. We identify signatures resulting from exposure to cobalt and vinylidene chloride and link distinct human signatures (SBS19 and SBS42) with 1,2,3-trichloropropane, a haloalkane and pollutant of drinking water, and find these and other signatures in human tumor genomes. We define the cross-species genomic landscape of tumors induced by an important compendium of agents with relevance to human health."
https://openalex.org/W3089847221,"Synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane to release neurotransmitter following an action potential, after which new vesicles must ‘dock’ to refill vacated release sites. To capture synaptic vesicle exocytosis at cultured mouse hippocampal synapses, we induced single action potentials by electrical field stimulation, then subjected neurons to high-pressure freezing to examine their morphology by electron microscopy. During synchronous release, multiple vesicles can fuse at a single active zone. Fusions during synchronous release are distributed throughout the active zone, whereas fusions during asynchronous release are biased toward the center of the active zone. After stimulation, the total number of docked vesicles across all synapses decreases by ~40%. Within 14 ms, new vesicles are recruited and fully replenish the docked pool, but this docking is transient and they either undock or fuse within 100 ms. These results demonstrate that the recruitment of synaptic vesicles to release sites is rapid and reversible. Kusick et al. capture snapshots of synaptic vesicle docking and fusion using a new time-resolved electron microscopy technique. They find that vesicles are replaced milliseconds after they fuse, which may contribute to short-term synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3091473648,"The mitotic kinase AURORA-A is essential for cell cycle progression and is considered a priority cancer target. Although the catalytic activity of AURORA-A is essential for its mitotic function, recent reports indicate an additional non-catalytic function, which is difficult to target by conventional small molecules. We therefore developed a series of chemical degraders (PROTACs) by connecting a clinical kinase inhibitor of AURORA-A to E3 ligase-binding molecules (for example, thalidomide). One degrader induced rapid, durable and highly specific degradation of AURORA-A. In addition, we found that the degrader complex was stabilized by cooperative binding between AURORA-A and CEREBLON. Degrader-mediated AURORA-A depletion caused an S-phase defect, which is not the cell cycle effect observed upon kinase inhibition, supporting an important non-catalytic function of AURORA-A during DNA replication. AURORA-A degradation induced rampant apoptosis in cancer cell lines and thus represents a versatile starting point for developing new therapeutics to counter AURORA-A function in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3090160959,"Alveolar epithelial regeneration is essential for recovery from devastating lung diseases. This process occurs when type II alveolar pneumocytes (AT2 cells) proliferate and transdifferentiate into type I alveolar pneumocytes (AT1 cells). We used genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility and gene expression following acute lung injury to elucidate repair mechanisms. AT2 chromatin accessibility changed substantially following injury to reveal STAT3 binding motifs adjacent to genes that regulate essential regenerative pathways. Single-cell transcriptome analysis identified brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) as a STAT3 target gene with newly accessible chromatin in a unique population of regenerating AT2 cells. Furthermore, the BDNF receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) was enriched on mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs). Loss or blockade of AT2-specific Stat3, Bdnf or mesenchyme-specific TrkB compromised repair and reduced Fgf7 expression by niche cells. A TrkB agonist improved outcomes in vivo following lung injury. These data highlight the biological and therapeutic importance of the STAT3-BDNF-TrkB axis in orchestrating alveolar epithelial regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3091710808,"Cattle pastoralism plays a central role in human livelihood in Africa. However, the genetic history of its success remains unknown. Here, through whole-genome sequence analysis of 172 indigenous African cattle from 16 breeds representative of the main cattle groups, we identify a major taurine × indicine cattle admixture event dated to circa 750–1,050 yr ago, which has shaped the genome of today’s cattle in the Horn of Africa. We identify 16 loci linked to African environmental adaptations across crossbred animals showing an excess of taurine or indicine ancestry. These include immune-, heat-tolerance- and reproduction-related genes. Moreover, we identify one highly divergent locus in African taurine cattle, which is putatively linked to trypanotolerance and present in crossbred cattle living in trypanosomosis-infested areas. Our findings indicate that a combination of past taurine and recent indicine admixture-derived genetic resources is at the root of the present success of African pastoralism. Whole-genome sequence analysis of 172 indigenous African cattle from 16 breeds identifies 16 loci linked to environmental adaptations among crossbred animals, including a highly divergent locus in African taurine cattle putatively linked to trypanotolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3089594507,"Protein kinases control nearly every facet of cellular function. These key signaling nodes integrate diverse pathway inputs to regulate complex physiological processes, and aberrant kinase signaling is linked to numerous pathologies. While fluorescent protein-based biosensors have revolutionized the study of kinase signaling by allowing direct, spatiotemporally precise kinase activity measurements in living cells, powerful new molecular tools capable of robustly tracking kinase activity dynamics across diverse experimental contexts are needed to fully dissect the role of kinase signaling in physiology and disease. Here, we report the development of an ultrasensitive, second-generation excitation-ratiometric protein kinase A (PKA) activity reporter (ExRai-AKAR2), obtained via high-throughput linker library screening, that enables sensitive and rapid monitoring of live-cell PKA activity across multiple fluorescence detection modalities, including plate reading, cell sorting and one- or two-photon imaging. Notably, in vivo visual cortex imaging in awake mice reveals highly dynamic neuronal PKA activity rapidly recruited by forced locomotion. A fluorescence-based sensor of PKA activity has increased brightness, dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio over related sensors and is useful for visualizing kinase activity in HeLa cells, primary neurons and the cortex of awake mice."
https://openalex.org/W3089541361,"Mitochondria contain the genetic information and expression machinery to produce essential respiratory chain proteins. Within the mitochondrial matrix, newly synthesized RNA, RNA processing proteins and mitoribosome assembly factors form punctate sub-compartments referred to as mitochondrial RNA granules (MRGs)1–3. Despite their proposed importance in regulating gene expression, the structural and dynamic properties of MRGs remain largely unknown. We investigated the internal architecture of MRGs using fluorescence super-resolution localization microscopy and correlative electron microscopy, and found that the MRG ultrastructure consists of compacted RNA embedded within a protein cloud. Using live-cell super-resolution structured illumination microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we reveal that MRGs rapidly exchange components and can undergo fusion, characteristic properties of fluid condensates4. Furthermore, MRGs associate with the inner mitochondrial membrane and their fusion coincides with mitochondrial remodelling. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission or fusion leads to an aberrant accumulation of MRGs into concentrated pockets, where they remain as distinct individual units despite their close apposition. Together, our findings reveal that MRGs are nanoscale fluid compartments, which are dispersed along mitochondria via membrane dynamics. Phase separation concentrates mitochondrial RNA granules. Here Rey et al., show that mitochondrial RNA granules (MRGs) behaviour is consistent with liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and their fusion coincides with mitochondrial remodelling."
https://openalex.org/W3091007690,"The MerR-family transcription factors (TFs) are a large group of bacterial proteins responding to cellular metal ions and multiple antibiotics by binding within central RNA polymerase-binding regions of a promoter. While most TFs alter transcription through protein-protein interactions, MerR TFs are capable of reshaping promoter DNA. To address the question of which mechanism prevails, we determined two cryo-EM structures of transcription activation complexes (TAC) comprising Escherichia coli CueR (a prototype MerR TF), RNAP holoenzyme and promoter DNA. The structures reveal that this TF promotes productive promoter-polymerase association without canonical protein-protein contacts seen between other activator proteins and RNAP. Instead, CueR realigns the key promoter elements in the transcription activation complex by clamp-like protein-DNA interactions: these induce four distinct kinks that ultimately position the -10 element for formation of the transcription bubble. These structural and biochemical results provide strong support for the DNA distortion paradigm of allosteric transcriptional control by MerR TFs."
https://openalex.org/W3089771048,"Onychomycosis is estimated at a prevalence of 10% worldwide with the infecting organism most commonly Trichophyton rubrum (T. rubrum). Traditional culture identification of causative organisms has inherent risks of overestimating dermatophytes, like T. rubrum, by inhibiting the growth of possible nondermatophyte mould (NDM) environmental contaminants which could be causative agents. Recently, molecular methods have revealed that a proportion of onychomycosis cases in North America may be caused by mixed infections of T. rubrum as an agent co-infecting with one or more NDM. Determining the global burden of mixed infections is a necessary step to evaluating the best therapies for this difficult-to-treat disease. To determine the prevalence of mixed infections in a global population, nail samples from onychomycosis patients in Brazil, Canada, and Israel (n = 216) were analyzed by molecular methods for the presence of dermatophytes and five NDMs. If an NDM was detected, repeat sampling was performed to confirm the NDM. T. rubrum was detected in 98% (211/216) of infections with 39% mixed (84/216). The infection type was more likely to be mixed in samples from Brazil, but more likely to be a dermatophyte in samples from Canada and Israel (Χ2 = 16.92, df = 2, P<0.001). The most common cause of onychomycosis was T. rubrum. In all countries (Brazil, Canada and Israel combined) the prevalence of dermatophyte (Χ2 = 211.15, df = 3, P<0.001) and mixed (dermatophyte and NDM; Χ2 = 166.38, df = 3, P<0.001) infection increased with patient age. Our data suggest that mixed infection onychomycosis is more prevalent than previously reported with the aging population being at increased risk for mixed infections."
https://openalex.org/W3091753338,"Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) transition between cell states in vitro, reflecting developmental changes in the early embryo. PSCs can be stabilized in the naive state by blocking extracellular differentiation stimuli, particularly FGF–MEK signalling. Here, we report that multiple features of the naive state in human and mouse PSCs can be recapitulated without affecting FGF–MEK signalling or global DNA methylation. Mechanistically, chemical inhibition of CDK8 and CDK19 (hereafter CDK8/19) kinases removes their ability to repress the Mediator complex at enhancers. CDK8/19 inhibition therefore increases Mediator-driven recruitment of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) to promoters and enhancers. This efficiently stabilizes the naive transcriptional program and confers resistance to enhancer perturbation by BRD4 inhibition. Moreover, naive pluripotency during embryonic development coincides with a reduction in CDK8/19. We conclude that global hyperactivation of enhancers drives naive pluripotency, and this can be achieved in vitro by inhibiting CDK8/19 kinase activity. These principles may apply to other contexts of cellular plasticity. Lynch et al. demonstrate that inhibiting CDK8 and CDK19 kinases increases Mediator-driven recruitment of RNA Pol II to promoters and enhancers, therefore stabilizing the naive transcriptional program."

https://openalex.org/W3089923041,"Background Without any pharmaceutical intervention and vaccination, the only way to combat Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is to slow down the spread of the disease by adopting non-pharmaceutical public health interventions (PHIs). Patient isolation, lockdown, quarantine, social distancing, changes in health care provision, and mass screening are the most common non-pharmaceutical PHIs to cope with the epidemic. However, there is neither systematic evidence on the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical PHIs in controlling the COVID-19 nor on how these interventions work in different contexts. Therefore, in this study we will address two main objectives: 1) to assess the effectiveness of the non-pharmaceutical PHIs in controlling the spread of COVID-19 using a systematic review and meta-analyses; 2) to explore why, how, and for whom these interventions work using a realist review. Materials and methods This review study has two main phases. In the first phase of this study, we will extract data from two main types of studies including quasi-experimental studies (such as quasi-randomized trials, controlled before-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs)) and observational studies (such as cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies), written in the English language. We will explore effectiveness of the non-pharmaceutical PHIs targeted either suppression or mitigation strategies (or a combination of both) in controlling the COVID-19 epidemics in the community level. Effectiveness will be considered as the changes in mortality rate, incidence rate, basic reproduction number rate, morbidity rate, rates of hospitalization, rates of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, and other health outcomes where possible. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses, if possible, using CMA software. In the second phase, we will conduct a realist review to find out how, why, for whom, and in what circumstances the non-pharmaceutical PHIs work. At the realist review, we will identify and explore Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations to provide a robust explanation on the effectiveness of the interventions in different contexts using Pawson's 5-step realist review template including: ""clarify scope; search for evidence; appraise primary studies and extract data; synthesize evidence and draw conclusions; and disseminate, implement and evaluate"". Although the steps are presented in a linear manner, in practice, we will follow them in iterative stages to fill any potential overlap. Discussion The findings of this research will provide a crucial insight into how and in which context the non-pharmaceutical PHIs work in controlling the spread of COVID-19. Conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis in line with a realist review will allow us to draw a robust conclusion on the effects and the way in which the interventions work. Understanding the role of contextual factors in the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical PHIs and the mechanism of this process could enable policymakers to implement appropriate policies and manage the COVID-19 epidemics more efficiently.

https://openalex.org/W3089922438,"The RNA-binding protein Ataxin-2 binds to and stabilizes a number of mRNA sequences, including that of the transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43). Ataxin-2 is additionally involved in several processes requiring translation, such as germline formation, long-term habituation, and circadian rhythm formation. However, it has yet to be unambiguously demonstrated that Ataxin-2 is actually involved in activating the translation of its target mRNAs. Here we provide direct evidence from a polysome profile analysis showing that Ataxin-2 enhances translation of target mRNAs. Our recently established method for transcriptional pulse-chase analysis under conditions of suppressing deadenylation revealed that Ataxin-2 promotes post-transcriptional polyadenylation of the target mRNAs. Furthermore, Ataxin-2 binds to a poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 and a noncanonical poly(A) polymerase PAPD4 via its intrinsically disordered region (amino acids 906–1095) to recruit PAPD4 to the targets. Post-transcriptional polyadenylation by Ataxin-2 explains not only how it activates translation but also how it stabilizes target mRNAs, including TDP-43 mRNA. Ataxin-2 is known to be a potent modifier of TDP-43 proteinopathies and to play a causative role in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, so these findings suggest that Ataxin-2–induced cytoplasmic polyadenylation and activation of translation might impact neurodegeneration (i.e. TDP-43 proteinopathies), and this process could be a therapeutic target for Ataxin-2–related neurodegenerative disorders.

Deadenylation is mediated by concerted actions of these PAM2-containing proteins; after translation is terminated, eRF1–eRF3 dissociates from PABPC1 bound to the poly(A) tail, and in turn, Pan2–Pan3 and Caf1–Ccr4–Tob associate with PABPC1, leading to the activation of the deadenylases and shortening of the poly(A) tail (as proposed in Refs. 10Funakoshi Y.

Thus, RNA-binding protein–mediated accelerated deadenylation of the target mRNA is well-established as a means for negative regulation of gene expression.

Li Q. Yamamoto M. Okada H. Suzuki Y. Kawahara Y. Direct binding of Ataxin-2 to distinct elements in 3‘ UTRs promotes mRNA stability and protein expression.Mol.

However, it remains unresolved whether Ataxin-2 affects translation of the target mRNAs and how Ataxin-2 stabilizes mRNAs. Here, we demonstrate that Ataxin-2 enhances translation through post-transcriptional polyadenylation of the targets, including cyclin D1 and TDP-43 mRNAs. Ataxin-2 physically interacts with PABPC1 and PAPD4 and induces lengthening of the poly(A) tail, which leads to the enhancement of translation. These results demonstrate that Ataxin-2–induced post-transcriptional polyadenylation positively regulates target gene expression at both translation and mRNA stability. Previous studies demonstrated that Ataxin-2 is involved in translation-required processes, including germline formation, long-term habituation, and circadian rhythm formation. Although there are multiple lines of correlational evidence, it has yet to be determined whether Ataxin-2 directly activates translation of its target mRNAs. To address this issue, we first utilized a tethering strategy in which Ataxin-2 was fused to the coat protein of bacteriophage MS2, and the MS2-binding site was incorporated into a reporter mRNA (Fig. 1A). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with three plasmids; the first harbored the firefly luciferase–MS2bs reporter that contains eight contiguous copies of the MS2-binding site (8 × MS2bs) in its 3′-UTR, the second is a reference plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase as a transfection/loading control, and the third expresses either MS2-fused 5×Myc-glutathione S-transferase (GST) or MS2-fused 5×Myc-Ataxin-2. Tethering of Ataxin-2 to the mRNA resulted in 4.1-fold increase in the level of the reporter protein as compared with that in the control case with GST (Fig. 1B). Under this condition, Ataxin-2 tethering resulted in a 2.0-fold increase in the level of the reporter mRNA as compared with that in the GST control (Fig. 1C). These results are consistent with a previous report showing that Ataxin-2 promotes mRNA stability and protein expression by using the λN-boxB tethering assay system (44Yokoshi M. Li Q. Yamamoto M. Okada H. Suzuki Y. Kawahara Y. Direct binding of Ataxin-2 to distinct elements in 3‘ UTRs promotes mRNA stability and protein expression.Mol. Cell. 2014; 55 (24954906): 186-19810.1016/j.molcel.2014.05.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is estimated that Ataxin-2 tethering resulted in a 2.1-fold increase in the translation efficiency of the reporter mRNA, as calculated by normalizing the reporter protein to the mRNA level (Fig. 1D). Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1E). To obtain direct evidence showing that Ataxin-2 enhances translation efficiency of the target mRNA, we examined the translation status of the target mRNA by performing polysome profile analysis. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with a reporter plasmid expressing FLAG-β-globin (BGG)–MS2bs mRNA and a plasmid expressing either MS2-fused 5×Myc-tagged GST or Ataxin-2. The cell lysates were loaded on a 10–50% linear sucrose density gradient and fractionated after ultracentrifugation to separate the polysomes. In terms of overall polysome profiles, no major changes were observed between Ataxin-2 tethering and GST control (Fig. 1F). RNAs extracted from each fraction were subjected to Northern blotting (Fig. 1F), and the levels of FLAG-BGG–MS2bs mRNA in each fraction were measured (Fig. 1G). Ataxin-2 tethering induced a shift in the distribution of the mRNA from nonpolysome fractions to heavy polysome fractions (over six ribosomes on mRNA) along the sucrose gradient (Fig. 1G, left). No such changes were observed for the control GAPDH mRNA (Fig. 1G, right). Calculation of mRNA levels in nonpolysomal, light polysomal, and heavy polysomal fractions showed that tethering of Ataxin-2 resulted in a 2.3-fold reduction in the level of FLAG-BGG–MS2bs mRNA in the nonpolysomal fractions as compared with the GST control, whereas a 1.9-fold increase in the level of FLAG-BGG–MS2bs mRNA in the heavy polysomal fractions (Fig. 1H). The changes were not observed for the control GAPDH mRNA (Fig. 1I). These results strongly suggest that Ataxin-2 promotes mRNA translation by enhancing translation efficiency of the target mRNA. Because Ataxin-2 contains PAM2 and binds to PABPC1 (45Kozlov G. Safaee N. Rosenauer A. Gehring K. Structural basis of binding of P-body-associated proteins GW182 and ataxin-2 by the Mlle domain of poly(A)-binding protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20181956): 13599-1360610.1074/jbc.M109.089540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that Ataxin-2 may be involved in the regulation of poly(A) tail. The fact that Ataxin-2 increases both translation efficiency and mRNA stability prompted us to consider the idea that poly(A) tail regulation may be involved in the mechanism underlying these Ataxin-2 actions. Consistent with this idea, we noticed that Ataxin-2 increased the size of the target mRNA. When MS2-fused Ataxin-2 was co-expressed in HEK293T cells with a β-globin mini gene MS2bs reporter (FLAG-BGG(1–39)–MS2bs) containing eight contiguous copies of the MS2-binding site (8 × MS2bs) in its 3′-UTR and a reference plasmid expressing 5×FLAG-enhanced GFP (EGFP) as the loading control, the length of the reporter mRNA increased markedly as compared with that in the GST control (Fig. 2 (A and B), compare lanes 1 and 2). To determine whether the observed increase in mRNA length by the tethering of Ataxin-2 to the mRNA 3′-UTR was due to the extension of the poly(A) tail, the lengths of the reporter mRNAs that were treated with oligo(dT)/RNase H to remove the poly(A) tail were analyzed. This treatment produced a single band that migrated at the A0 (unpolyadenylated) position (Fig. 2 (D and E), compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 5 and 6, respectively). The results indicated that the observed increase of mRNA length was indeed due to the increased lengths of the poly(A) tails. The expression of Ataxin-2 protein was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2F, lanes 1 and 2). To further examine the possibility that Ataxin-2–induced poly(A) tail lengthening may be due to the binding of Ataxin-2 to PABPC1 through PAM2, we prepared Ataxin-2 with mutation at Phe-921 to alanine (F921A) in PAM2. The F921A mutation abolished the binding of Ataxin-2 to PABPC1 (Fig. S1). Tethering of Ataxin-2 F921A to the 3′-UTR no longer increased the length of the reporter mRNA as compared with that in the GST control (Fig. 2 (A and B), compare lanes 1 and 3). These results indicate that Ataxin-2 promotes lengthening of the poly(A) tail of the target mRNA through interaction with PABPC1. The expression of Ataxin-2 proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2C). The observed increase in the length of the poly(A) tail could be explained by the two possible molecular events (viz. enhanced polyadenylation or inhibition of deadenylation). To distinguish these possibilities, we first determined whether the increase of poly(A) tail length that is mediated by Ataxin-2 could be caused by the inhibition of mRNA deadenylation by examining the effect of expressing catalytically inactive Pan2 and Caf1 mutants (Pan2 D1083A and Caf1 D161A, respectively) as described previously (35Yamagishi R. Tsusaka T. Mitsunaga H. Maehata T. Hoshino S. The STAR protein QKI-7 recruits PAPD4 to regulate post-transcriptional polyadenylation of target mRNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26926106): 2475-249010.1093/nar/gkw118Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The overexpression of these mutants completely inhibited deadenylation of the reporter mRNA in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2, D (compare lanes 1 and 3) and E). Under these conditions, Ataxin-2 additionally increased the length of the mRNA poly(A) tail (Fig. 2, D (compare lanes 3 and 4) and E). This indicated that the Ataxin-2–induced increase in mRNA poly(A) tail length was not caused by the inhibition of mRNA deadenylation. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2F). These results strongly suggest that Ataxin-2 extends mRNA poly(A) tail length via mRNA polyadenylation. The above result shows that PAM2 of Ataxin-2 is required for inducing polyadenylation of its target mRNA (Fig. 2, A and B); however, other regions may also be involved in the induction. Thus, we constructed a series of deletion mutants of Ataxin-2 to map the region required for the induction of polyadenylation.

https://openalex.org/W3090336390,"TRAAK is an ion channel from the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family with roles in maintaining the resting membrane potential and fast action potential conduction. Regulated by a wide range of physical and chemical stimuli, the affinity and selectivity of K2P4.1 toward lipids remains poorly understood. Here we show the two isoforms of K2P4.1 have distinct binding preferences for lipids dependent on acyl chain length and position on the glycerol backbone. The channel can also discriminate the fatty acid linkage at the SN1 position. Of the 33 lipids interrogated using native mass spectrometry, phosphatidic acid had the lowest equilibrium dissociation constants for both isoforms of K2P4.1. Liposome potassium flux assays with K2P4.1 reconstituted in defined lipid environments show that those containing phosphatidic acid activate the channel in a dose-dependent fashion. Our results begin to define the molecular requirements for the specific binding of lipids to K2P4.1."

https://openalex.org/W3090631522,"A mesoscale network model is proposed for the development of spike and wave discharges (SWDs) in the cortico-thalamo-cortical (C-T-C) circuit. It is based on experimental findings in two genetic models of childhood absence epilepsy-rats of WAG/Rij and GAERS strains. The model is organized hierarchically into two levels (brain structures and individual neurons) and composed of compartments for representation of somatosensory cortex, reticular and ventroposteriomedial thalamic nuclei. The cortex and the two thalamic compartments contain excitatory and inhibitory connections between four populations of neurons. Two connected subnetworks both including relevant parts of a C-T-C network responsible for SWD generation are modelled: a smaller subnetwork for the focal area in which the SWD generation can take place, and a larger subnetwork for surrounding areas which can be only passively involved into SWDs, but which is mostly responsible for normal brain activity. This assumption allows modeling of both normal and SWD activity as a dynamical system (no noise is necessary), providing reproducibility of results and allowing future analysis by means of theory of dynamical system theories. The model is able to reproduce most time-frequency changes in EEG activity accompanying the transition from normal to epileptiform activity and back. Three different mechanisms of SWD initiation reported previously in experimental studies were successfully reproduced in the model. The model incorporates also a separate mechanism for the maintenance of SWDs based on coupling analysis from experimental data. Finally, the model reproduces the possibility to stop ongoing SWDs with high frequency electrical stimulation, as described in the literature."

However, the short half-life of PDGF-BB and its rapid release from the wound surface limited its efficacy in vivo and vitro. To evaluate the wound healing effects of dorsal skin in SD rats with polydopamine-assisted immobilized PDGF-BB on PLGA nanofibrous substrate. First, the effects of pDA-coating and PDGF-BB immobilization on the morphology, compositions, and hydrophilicity of substrates were evaluated in details. Second, the wound healing effect of pDA/PLGA/PDGF-BB substrate was assessed in the dorsal skin of SD rats. Last, the cytokine analysis by ELISA method was employed to evaluate the advantages of pDA/PLGA/PDGF-BB substrate on anti-inflammatory, angiogenesis, and cellular proliferation. This method significantly improved the immobilization amount and stability of PDGF-BB on the substrate (p<0.01), further improved the hydrophilicity of substrates (p<0.05). Furthermore, the wound closure process was much more accelerated in the pDA/PLGA/PDGF-BB group (p<0.05). H&E and CD31 staining informed that the wound treated by pDA/PLGA/PDGF-BB substrate showed a high degree of regeneration and angiogenesis. The cytokine analysis showed that pDA significantly reduced the high level of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α (p<0.05). And the immobilized PDGF-BB significantly elevated the level of TGF-β and VEGF (p<0.05). The pDA/PLGA/PDGF-BB substrate showed great therapeutic effect on wound healing compared with other control groups via regulating anti-inflammatory, angiogenesis, and cellular proliferation. Absolutely, this report offered an available novel method for skin regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W3090490912,"Fabry Disease (FD) is a systemic disorder that can result in cardiovascular, renal, and neurovascular disease leading to reduced life expectancy. FD should be considered in the differential of all patients with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We therefore performed a prospective screening study in Edmonton and Hong Kong using Dried Blood Spot (DBS) testing on patients with undiagnosed LVH. Participants found to have unexplained LVH on echocardiography were invited to participate and subsequently subjected to DBS testing. DBS testing was used to measure α-galactosidase (α-GAL) enzyme activity and for mutation analysis of the α-galactosidase (GLA) gene, both of which are required to make a diagnosis of FD. DBS testing was performed as a screening tool on patients (n = 266) in Edmonton and Hong Kong, allowing for detection of five patients with FD (2% prevalence of FD) and one patient with hydroxychloroquine-induced phenocopy. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) by GLA genotype showed a higher LVMI in patients with IVS4 + 919G > A mutations compared to those without the mutation. Two patients were initiated on ERT and hydroxychloroquine was discontinued in the patient with a phenocopy of FD. Overall, we detected FD in 2% of our screening cohort using DBS testing as an effective and easy to administer screening tool in patients with unexplained LVH. Utilizing DBS testing to screen for FD in patients with otherwise undiagnosed LVH is clinically important due to the availability of effective therapies and the value of cascade screening in extended families."
https://openalex.org/W3091171141,"Evidence suggests that the application of Kinesio Tape (KT) on patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNLBP) is inconclusive. Dynamic tape (DT) is a relatively new treatment technique, which is increasingly being used as an adjunctive method to treat musculoskeletal problems. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the application of DT in individuals with CNLBP. To compare the immediate and short-term effects of DT versus KT and no tape among patients with CNLBP on pain, endurance, disability, mobility, and kinesiophobia. Forty-five patients with CNLBP were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Outcomes were measured at baseline, immediately, and on the third day post-application of tapes. The primary outcomes of pain, endurance, and disability were measured through the visual analog scale (VAS), Biering–Sorensen test, and Oswestry disability index (ODI), respectively. Secondary outcome measures of mobility and kinesiophobia were measured using the modified–modified Schober test and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, respectively. No significant immediate and short-term differences were found between DT and KT in pain, disability, mobility, and kinesiophobia. Improved back extensor endurance was observed for the DT group than KT (p = 0.023) and control group (p = 0.006). The application of DT may result in improvements only in back extensor endurance among individuals with CNLBP. This finding suggests that DT controls the processes that lead to back muscle fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W3090392288,"We measured food availability and diet composition of juvenile salmonids over multiple years and seasons before and during the world’s largest dam removal on the Elwha River, Washington State. We conducted these measurements over three sediment-impacted sections (the estuary and two sections of the river downstream of each dam) and compared these to data collected from mainstem tributaries not directly affected by the massive amount of sediment released from the reservoirs. We found that sediment impacts from dam removal significantly reduced invertebrate prey availability, but juvenile salmon adjusted their foraging so that the amount of energy in diets was similar before and during dam removal. This general pattern was seen in both river and estuary habitats, although the mechanisms driving the change and the response differed between habitats. In the estuary, the dietary shifts were related to changes in invertebrate assemblages following a hydrological transition from brackish to freshwater caused by sediment deposition at the river’s mouth. The loss of brackish invertebrate species caused fish to increase piscivory and rely on new prey sources such as plankton. In the river, energy provided to fish by Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa before dam removal was replaced first by terrestrial invertebrates, and then by sediment-tolerant taxa such as Chironomidae. The results of our study are consistent with many others that have shown sharp declines in invertebrate density during dam removal. Our study further shows how those changes can move through the food web and affect fish diet composition, selectivity, and energy availability. As we move further along the dam removal response trajectory, we hypothesize that food web complexity will continue to increase as annual sediment load now approaches natural background levels, anadromous fish have recolonized the majority of the watershed between and above the former dams, and revegetation and microhabitats continue to develop in the estuary."
https://openalex.org/W3091434305,"Grain hardness is an important quality trait of cereal crops. In wheat, it is mainly determined by the Hardness locus that harbors genes encoding puroindoline A (PINA) and puroindoline B (PINB). Any deletion or mutation of these genes leading to the absence of PINA or to single amino acid changes in PINB leads to hard endosperms. Although it is generally acknowledged that hardness is controlled by adhesion strength between the protein matrix and starch granules, the physicochemical mechanisms connecting puroindolines and the starch-protein interactions are unknown as of this time. To explore these mechanisms, we focused on PINA. The overexpression in a hard wheat cultivar (cv. Courtot with the Pina-D1a and Pinb-D1d alleles) decreased grain hardness in a dose-related effect, suggesting an interactive process. When PINA was added to gliadins in solution, large aggregates of up to 13 μm in diameter were formed. Turbidimetry measurements showed that the PINA-gliadin interaction displayed a high cooperativity that increased with a decrease in pH from neutral to acid (pH 4) media, mimicking the pH change during endosperm development. No turbidity was observed in the presence of isolated α– and γ-gliadins, but non-cooperative interactions of PINA with these proteins could be confirmed by surface plasmon resonance. A significant higher interaction of PINA with γ-gliadins than with α–gliadins was observed. Similar binding behavior was observed with a recombinant repeated polypeptide that mimics the repeat domain of gliadins, i.e., (Pro-Gln-Gln-Pro-Tyr)8. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of PINA with a monomeric gliadin creates a nucleation point leading to the aggregation of other gliadins, a phenomenon that could prevent further interaction of the storage prolamins with starch granules. Consequently, the role of puroindoline-prolamin interactions on grain hardness should be addressed on the basis of previous observations that highlight the similar subcellular routing of storage prolamins and puroindolines."
https://openalex.org/W3090205211,"Background Severe acute malnutrition is defined by <70% weight for length/height, by visible severe wasting, by the presence of pitting edema, and in children 6 to 59 months of age, mid upper arm circumference <110 mm. Severe acute malnutrition remains to be a worldwide problem, claiming lives of millions of children, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Though the Ethiopian national guideline states the total length of stay in therapeutic feeding units should not be more than four weeks, there is huge difference, varying from 8 to 47 days of stay. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess length of stay to recover from severe acute malnutrition and associated factors among under five children hospitalized to the public hospitals in Aksum Town. Methods Sample size was calculated using STATA version 12.0. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using pretested questionnaire in the public hospitals in Aksum on children aged 0–59 months. Cleaned data was entered to Epi info version 7.1.4 and then exported into SPSS version 21 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed using Kaplan Meier and Cox regression models. During bivariable analysis, variables with p-value < 0.05 were selected for multivariable analysis to identify independent factors associated with length of stay. Results A total of 564 participants enrolled to the study. The rate of recovery was 56% with median length of stay of 15 days (95% CI: 14.1, 15.9). The independent predictors of length of stay to recovery were presence of diarrhea at admission (AHR = 0.573, 95% CI: 0.415–0.793), being HIV positive (AHR = 0.391, 95% CI: 0.194–0.788), palmar pallor (AHR = 0.575, 95% CI: 0.416–0.794), presence of other co-morbidities at admission (AHR = 0.415, 95% CI: 0.302–0.570) and not being treated with plumpy nut (AHR = 0.368, 95% CI: 0.262–0.518). Conclusions Length of stay is in the acceptable range of the international and national set of standards. Nevertheless, the recovery rate was lower compared to the Sphere standard. Presence of diarrhea, palmar pallor, HIV other co-morbidities and not treated with plumpy nut were found independent protective factors for recovery from sever acute malnutrition."

However, the association with childhood obesity is inconsistent. We investigated the association between reported cumulative ACE score and body mass index (BMI) in a large sample of patients at a single institution.This cross-sectional study included children aged 2-20 years that were screened in a general pediatrics clinic for ACEs utilizing the Center for Youth Wellness ACEs questionnaire between July 2017 and July 2018. Overall ACE score was categorized as 'no exposure' (score = 0), 'low exposure' (score = 1), and 'high exposure' (score≥ 2). BMI was categorized as overweight/obese (BMI percentile ≥ 85) or non-obese (BMI percentile < 85). The association between ACEs score and obesity was determined using univariate and multivariable logistic regression.Of the 948 patients included in the study, 30% (n = 314) were overweight/obese and 53% (n = 504) had no ACE exposure, 19% (n = 179) had low ACE exposure, and 28% (n = 265) had high ACE exposure. High ACE exposure was associated with increased odds of obesity (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.07-2.03, p = 0.026). However, after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, insurance type, and birth weight, the association attenuated and was null (OR = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.70-1.46, p = 0.97).The study findings may suggest an association between ACE and childhood obesity. However, the association attenuated after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, insurance type, and birth weight. Larger prospective studies are warranted to better understand the association."
https://openalex.org/W3090446169,"Natural products obtained from species of the genus Abuta (Menispermaceae) are known as ethnobotanicals that are attracting increasing attention due to a wide range of their pharmacological properties. In this study, the alkaloids stepharine and 5-N-methylmaytenine were first isolated from branches of Abuta panurensis Eichler, an endemic species from the Amazonian rainforest. Structure of the compounds was elucidated by a combination of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic and MS and HRMS spectrometric techniques. Interaction of the above-mentioned alkaloids with acetylcholinesterase enzyme and interleukins IL-6 and IL-8 was investigated in silico by molecular docking. The molecules under investigation were able to bind effectively with the active sites of the AChE enzyme, IL-6, and IL-8 showing affinity towards the proteins. Along with the theoretical study, acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition, cytotoxic, and immunomodulatory activity of the compounds were assessed by in vitro assays. The data obtained in silico corroborate the results of AChE enzyme inhibition, the IC50 values of 61.24μM for stepharine and 19.55μM for 5-N-methylmaytenine were found. The compounds showed cytotoxic activity against two tumor cell lines (K562 and U937) with IC50 values ranging from 11.77 μM to 28.48 μM. The in vitro assays revealed that both alkaloids were non-toxic to Vero and human PBMC cells. As for the immunomodulatory activity, both compounds inhibited the production of IL-6 at similar levels. Stepharine inhibited considerably the production of IL-8 in comparison to 5-N-methylmaytenine, which showed a dose dependent action (inhibitory at the IC50 dose, and stimulatory at the twofold IC50 one). Such a behavior may possibly be explained by different binding modes of the alkaloids to the interleukin structural fragments. Occurrence of the polyamine alkaloid 5-N-methylmaytenine was reported for the first time for the Menispermaceae family, as well as the presence of stepharine in A. panurensis."
https://openalex.org/W3090493638,"Extending oceanographic data beyond the instrumental period is highly needed to better characterize and understand multi-decadal to centennial natural ocean variability. Here, a stable isotope record at unprecedented temporal resolution (1 to 2 years) from a new marine core retrieved off western North Iceland is presented. We aim to better constrain the variability of subsurface, Atlantic-derived Subpolar Mode Water (SPMW), using near surface-dwelling planktic foraminifera and Arctic Intermediate Water (AIW) mass changes using benthic foraminifera over the last ~165 years. The reconstruction overlaps in time with instrumental observations and a direct comparison reveals that the δ18O record of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma is reliably representing temperature fluctuations in the SPMWs. Trends in the N. pachyderma δ13C record match the measured phosphate concentration in the upper 200 m on the North Icelandic Shelf well. Near surface-dwelling foraminifera trace anthropogenic CO2 in the Iceland Sea by ~ 1950 ± 8, however, a reduced amplitude shift in the Marine Suess effect is identified. We argue that this is caused by a contemporary ongoing increase in marine primary productivity in the upper ocean due to enhanced Greenland’s freshwater discharge that has contributed to a nutrient-driven fertilization since the 1940s/50s (Perner et al., 2019). Multi-decadal variability is detected. We find that the 16-year periodicity evident in SPMW and AIWs based on the δ18O of N. pachyderma and M. barleeanum is a signal of SST anomalies propagated into the Nordic Seas via the Atlantic inflow branches around Iceland. Spectral analyses of the planktic foraminiferal δ13C signal indicate intermittent 30-year cycles that are likely reflecting the ocean response to atmospheric variability, presumably the East Atlantic Pattern. A long-term trend in benthic δ18O suggests that Atlantic-derived waters are expanding their core within the water column from the subsurface into deeper intermediate depths towards the present day. This is a result of increased transport by the North Icelandic Irminger Current to the North Iceland Shelf over the historical era."
https://openalex.org/W3090865945,"Currently, there are no registered veterinary drugs for the treatment of endocrinopathic equine laminitis, and although this form of the disease is known to be caused by prolonged hyperinsulinaemia, the mechanism of insulin toxicity is unclear. One possibility is that high concentrations of insulin activate IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R) in lamellar tissue, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and epidermal lamellar dysregulation. An equinized version of a human anti-IGF-1R therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb11) was generated to test this theory, using a modification of the prolonged euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique. Healthy Standardbred horses were infused for 48 h with 0.9% saline (negative-control, n = 6), a combination of insulin (4.5 mIU/kgBW/min) and a variable infusion of 50% glucose to maintain euglycaemia (positive-control, n = 6), or insulin and glucose, preceded by a low dose of mAb11 (20 mg), designed to treat one foot only and delivered by retrograde infusion into one forelimb (mAb-treated, n = 7). Maximum insulin concentrations were 502 ± 54.4 and 435 ± 30.4 μIU/mL in the positive-control and mAb11-treated groups, respectively (P = 0.33). While the control group remained healthy, all the insulin-treated horses developed laminitis within 30 h, as judged by clinical examination, foot radiographs and histological analysis. Some effects of insulin were not attenuated by the antibody, however, relative to the positive-control group, horses treated with mAb11 showed less sinking of the distal phalanx (P < 0.05) and milder histological changes, with markedly less elongation at the tips of the secondary epidermal lamellae (P < 0.05). These differences were apparent in both front feet and were statistically significant when the values for both feet were combined. The results confirm that IGF-1R may have a role in insulin-induced laminitis and suggest that mAb11 warrants further research as a potential agent to prevent or treat the disease."

Limited studies have discussed the interaction between ecosystem services and urbanization; therefore, in this research, the spatial relationship between ecosystem services and urbanization is explored by taking the urban agglomeration in Central Yunnan as an example, and land-use data and economic and social data from 2009 and 2018 are used to determine the interactive impact of urbanization on the urban ecosystem. It is shown that (1) the spatial distribution of the urbanization level of the urban agglomeration in Central Yunnan has significant regional differences, showing a decreasing trend from the urbanized area to the surrounding areas. (2) Another factor with obvious regional differences is the spatial distribution of ecosystem services, which is similar to urbanization in spatial distribution. This difference is mainly caused by the impact of the urbanization level and the change in land use. (3) The spatial distribution and local agglomeration of urbanization and the ecosystem service value of urban agglomeration in Central Yunnan are very similar, and there is a significant negative correlation between the urbanization level and ecosystem service value. The research results have guiding significance for future urban and ecological development in Central Yunnan city."
https://openalex.org/W4206201318,"While mechanisms for metastasis were extensively studied in cancer cells from patients with detectable tumors, pathways underlying metastatic dissemination from early lesions before primary tumors appear are poorly understood. Her2 promotes breast cancer early dissemination by suppressing p38, but how Her2 downregulates p38 is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that in early lesion breast cancer models, Her2 inhibits p38 by inducing Skp2 through Akt-mediated phosphorylation, which promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Tpl2, a p38 MAP3K. The early disseminating cells are Her2+Skp2highTpl2lowp-p38lowE-cadherinlow in the MMTV-Her2 breast cancer model. In human breast carcinoma, high Skp2 and low Tpl2 expression are associated with the Her2+ status; Tpl2 expression positively correlates with that of activated p38; Skp2 expression negatively correlates with that of Tpl2 and activated p38. Moreover, the Her2-Akt-Skp2-Tpl2-p38 axis plays a key role in the disseminating phenotypes in early lesion breast cancer cells; inhibition of Tpl2 enhances early dissemination in vivo. These findings identify the Her2-Akt-Skp2-Tpl2-p38 cascade as a novel mechanism mediating breast cancer early dissemination and a potential target for novel therapies targeting early metastatic dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W3090530736,"Oncogenic mutations in RAS genes, like KRASG12D or NRASG12D, trap Ras in the active state and cause myeloproliferative disorder and T cell leukemia (T-ALL) when induced in the bone marrow via Mx1CRE. The RAS exchange factor RASGRP1 is frequently overexpressed in T-ALL patients. In T-ALL cell lines overexpression of RASGRP1 increases flux through the RASGTP/RasGDP cycle. Here we expanded RASGRP1 expression surveys in pediatric T-ALL and generated a RoLoRiG mouse model crossed to Mx1CRE to determine the consequences of induced RASGRP1 overexpression in primary hematopoietic cells. RASGRP1-overexpressing, GFP-positive cells outcompeted wild type cells and dominated the peripheral blood compartment over time. RASGRP1 overexpression bestows gain-of-function colony formation properties to bone marrow progenitors in medium containing limited growth factors. RASGRP1 overexpression enhances baseline mTOR-S6 signaling in the bone marrow, but not in vitro cytokine-induced signals. In agreement with these mechanistic findings, hRASGRP1-ires-EGFP enhances fitness of stem- and progenitor- cells, but only in the context of native hematopoiesis. RASGRP1 overexpression is distinct from KRASG12D or NRASG12D, does not cause acute leukemia on its own, and leukemia virus insertion frequencies predict that RASGRP1 overexpression can effectively cooperate with lesions in many other genes to cause acute T-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W3090361248,"The purpose of this study was to develop a high-frequency wave therapy model in rats and to investigate the influence of high-frequency waves on root canal treatment, which may provide a novel strategy for treating apical periodontitis. Root canal treatments with and without high-frequency wave irradiation were performed on the mandibular first molars of 10-week-old male Wistar rats. The mesial roots were evaluated radiologically, bacteriologically, and immunohistochemically. At 3 weeks after root canal treatment, lesion volume had decreased significantly more in the irradiated group than in the non-irradiated group, indicating successful development of the high-frequency therapy model. The use of high-frequency waves provided no additional bactericidal effect after root canal treatment. However, high-frequency wave irradiation was found to promote healing of periapical lesions on the host side through increased expression of fibroblast growth factor 2 and transforming growth factor-β1 and could therefore be useful as an adjuvant nonsurgical treatment for apical periodontitis."

In order to analyze the population structure of tropical maize lines and identify genomic regions associated with low-N tolerance, a set of 64 inbred lines were evaluated under low-N and optimal-N conditions. The low-N Agronomic Efficiency index (LNAE) of each line was calculated. The maize lines were genotyped using 417,112 SNPs markers. The grouping based on the LNAE values classified the lines into two phenotypic groups, the first comprised by genotypes with high LNAE (named H_LNAE group), while the second one comprised genotypes with low LNAE (named L_LNAE group). The H_LNAE and L_LNAE groups had LNAE mean values of 3,304 and 1,644, respectively. The population structure analysis revealed a weak relationship between genetic and phenotypic diversity. Pairs of lines were identified, having at the same time high LNAE and high genetic distance from each other. A set of 29 SNPs markers exhibited a significant difference in allelic frequencies (Fst > 0.2) between H_LNAE and L_LNAE groups. The Pearson's correlation between LNAE and the favorable alleles in this set of SNPs was 0.69. These SNPs could be useful for marker-assisted selection for low-N tolerance in maize breeding programs. The results of this study could help maize breeders identify accessions to be used in the development of low-N tolerant cultivars."

It plays pivotal role in arid ecosystems since it is tolerant to high salinity and drought. This species is widely distributed throughout Mongolia and it is mostly found in arid ecosystems of Mongolian Gobi Desert. In this study, we developed allometric equations for estimating above-ground biomass of N. sibirica using various structural descriptors and pinpointed the best models. Variables that precisely predicted above-ground biomass were a combination of basal diameter, crown area, and height. The allometric growth equation constructed is not merely helpful to achieve accurate estimations of the above-ground biomass in shrub vegetation in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, but also can provide a reference for the above-ground biomass of Nitraria species growing in analogous habitats worldwide. Therefore, our research purposes an important advance for biomass estimation in Gobi ecosystems and complements previous studies of shrub biomass worldwide. This study provides reasonable estimates of biomass of N. sibirica, which will be valuable in evaluations of biological resources, especially for quantifying the main summer diet of Gobi bears, and also can be an alternative tool for assessing carbon cycling in Gobi Desert."

This study also reveals the first confirmation of fowl adenovirus in Poland, supporting one of the hypotheses about the probability of fowl adenovirus interspecies transmission. The adenovirus strain sequences were investigated via phylogenetic analysis and were found to have an overall mean pairwise distance of 2.189. The heterogeneity, Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU), codon composition, and nucleotide frequencies were examined. Statistical analyses and Tajima's test for the examined sequences were carried out. The Maximum Likelihood for the examined sequences substitutions was performed. The results of the sequence analysis identified MT478054, JSN-G033-18-L and MT478055, JSN-G033-18-B as strains of fowl adenovirus 2/11/D, with the Fowl adenovirus D complete sequence showing a 93% match. Wild birds may act as a natural reservoir for FAdVs and likely play an important role in the spreading of these viruses in the environment. The findings reported here suggest horizontal transmission within and between avian species."
