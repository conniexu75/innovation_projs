https://openalex.org/W3183792933,"Despite impressive progress, more than 50% of patients treated with CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR19) experience progressive disease. Ten of 16 patients with large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) with progressive disease after CAR19 treatment had absent or low CD19. Lower surface CD19 density pretreatment was associated with progressive disease. To prevent relapse with CD19- or CD19lo disease, we tested a bispecific CAR targeting CD19 and/or CD22 (CD19-22.BB.z-CAR) in a phase I clinical trial ( NCT03233854 ) of adults with relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and LBCL. The primary end points were manufacturing feasibility and safety with a secondary efficacy end point. Primary end points were met; 97% of products met protocol-specified dose and no dose-limiting toxicities occurred during dose escalation. In B-ALL (n = 17), 100% of patients responded with 88% minimal residual disease-negative complete remission (CR); in LBCL (n = 21), 62% of patients responded with 29% CR. Relapses were CD19-/lo in 50% (5 out of 10) of patients with B-ALL and 29% (4 out of 14) of patients with LBCL but were not associated with CD22-/lo disease. CD19/22-CAR products demonstrated reduced cytokine production when stimulated with CD22 versus CD19. Our results further implicate antigen loss as a major cause of CAR T cell resistance, highlight the challenge of engineering multi-specific CAR T cells with equivalent potency across targets and identify cytokine production as an important quality indicator for CAR T cell potency."
https://openalex.org/W3186986349,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the functioning of universities worldwide. In Poland, the transfer to online teaching was announced without prior warning, which radically changed students’ daily functioning. This situation clearly showed the students’ helplessness and difficulties with coping with this new, stressful situation, highlighted in many previous studies. A sudden and far-reaching change in daily functioning caused anxiety, depression, and stress in this group. Thus, from a pedagogical and psychological point of view, it is pertinent to examine the students’ strategies of coping with stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, in 2020, a sample of Polish students was anonymously measured using the Mini-COPE questionnaire. Data was gathered from 577 students from 17 universities. The statistical analysis showed that during the coronavirus pandemic, Polish students most often used the coping strategies of: acceptance, planning, and seeking emotional support. Such factors as age, gender, and place of residence influenced the choice of specific strategies of coping with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results also showed that the youngest students had the lowest coping skills. The results allow for concluding that the students’ maladaptive strategies of coping with stress, especially during the pandemic, may result in long-term consequences for their psychophysiological health and academic achievements. Thus, based on the current results and on the participatory model of intervention, a support program for students is proposed which would involve psychological, organizational, and instrumental support."
https://openalex.org/W3184987452,"Autism is a highly heritable complex disorder in which de novo mutation (DNM) variation contributes significantly to risk. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 3,474 families, we investigate another source of large-effect risk variation, ultra-rare variants. We report and replicate a transmission disequilibrium of private, likely gene-disruptive (LGD) variants in probands but find that 95% of this burden resides outside of known DNM-enriched genes. This variant class more strongly affects multiplex family probands and supports a multi-hit model for autism. Candidate genes with private LGD variants preferentially transmitted to probands converge on the E3 ubiquitin–protein ligase complex, intracellular transport and Erb signaling protein networks. We estimate that these variants are approximately 2.5 generations old and significantly younger than other variants of similar type and frequency in siblings. Overall, private LGD variants are under strong purifying selection and appear to act on a distinct set of genes not yet associated with autism. Analysis of whole-genome sequence data from 3,474 families finds an excess of private, likely gene-disrupting variants in individuals with autism. These variants are under purifying selection and suggest candidate genes not previously associated with autism."
https://openalex.org/W3184481402,"Whole-brain mesoscale mapping in primates has been hindered by large brain sizes and the relatively low throughput of available microscopy methods. Here, we present an approach that combines primate-optimized tissue sectioning and clearing with ultrahigh-speed fluorescence microscopy implementing improved volumetric imaging with synchronized on-the-fly-scan and readout technique, and is capable of completing whole-brain imaging of a rhesus monkey at 1 × 1 × 2.5 µm3 voxel resolution within 100 h. We also developed a highly efficient method for long-range tracing of sparse axonal fibers in datasets numbering hundreds of terabytes. This pipeline, which we call serial sectioning and clearing, three-dimensional microscopy with semiautomated reconstruction and tracing (SMART), enables effective connectome-scale mapping of large primate brains. With SMART, we were able to construct a cortical projection map of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and identify distinct turning and routing patterns of individual axons in the cortical folds while approaching their arborization destinations."
https://openalex.org/W3183166897,"Background The aim of this study is to explore factors influencing the study engagement of health and social professions students during the COVID-19 pandemic. While antecedents of study engagement have been studied previously, the factors influencing engagement under pandemic conditions have not yet been investigated. Furthermore, there is a particular need for research among students in health and social professions programs, as these students are particularly affected by the pandemic. As theoretical basis, the study draws on the demands-resources-theory. It is hypothesized that pandemic-related study and personal resources drive engagement during the pandemic, and that pandemic-related demands negatively influence engagement. Method The study uses a cross-sectional survey to explore the hypothesized effects. The sample consists of 559 university students of health and social professions in Germany. The study was carried out in July 2020, towards the end of the first digital semester and after the first peak in COVID-19 cases. Data are analyzed using linear multiple regression analysis. Results The findings show that the demands-resources-theory is suitable to explain study engagement even under pandemic conditions. Suitable digital learning formats and social support are identified as important study resources for study engagement during major life events, while emotional resilience, active self-care and academic self-efficacy are identified as important personal resources. Conclusions Under pandemic conditions academic institutions should focus on providing beneficial teaching formats and innovative ways to support students lacking social networks. Besides, they should consider developing means to help students structuring daily life as well as establishing initiatives to strengthen students’ self-efficacy beliefs."
https://openalex.org/W3184333579,"Background The hematological abnormalities are assumed to be involved in the disease progression of COVID-19. However, the actual associations between specific blood parameters and COVID-19 are not well understood. Here we aimed to assess the correlations between hematological parameters and the severity of COVID-19. Methods We included COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Evercare Hospital Ltd, Dhaka, Bangladesh, between November 10, 2020, to April 12, 2021, with a confirmed case of RT-PCR test. We recorded demographic information, clinical data, and routine hematological examination results of all COVID-19 patients. We performed statistical analyses and interpretation of data to compare severe COVID-19 patients (SCP) and non-severe COVID-19 patients (NSCP). Results The age and BMI of the admitted COVID-19 patients were 48.79±8.53 years and 25.82±3.75 kg/m 2 . This study included a total of 306 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Among them, NSCP and SCP were 198 and 108, respectively. And we recorded 12 deaths from SCP. We observed the alterations of several hematological parameters between SCP and NSCP. Among them, we noticed the increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), d-dimer, and ferritin showed good indicative value to evaluate the severity of COVID-19. Also, there were positive correlations among these parameters. Moreover, we found correlations between the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with patient’s demographics and comorbid diseases. Conclusion Based on our results, CRP, d-dimer, and ferritin levels at admission to hospitals represent simple assessment factors for COVID-19 severity and the treatment decisions at the hospital setup. These blood parameters could serve as indicators for the prognosis and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, our study findings might help to develop a treatment protocol for COVID-19 patients at the hospital setup."

https://openalex.org/W3186388954,"Therapy of severely affected coronavirus patient, requiring intubation and sedation is still challenging. Recently, difficulties in sedating these patients have been discussed. This study aims to describe sedation practices in patients with 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).We performed a retrospective monocentric analysis of sedation regimens in critically ill intubated patients with respiratory failure who required sedation in our mixed 32-bed university intensive care unit. All mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19-induced ARDS requiring continuously infused sedative therapy admitted between April 4, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were included. We recorded demographic data, sedative dosages, prone positioning, sedation levels and duration. Descriptive data analysis was performed; for additional analysis, a logistic regression with mixed effect was used.In total, 56 patients (mean age 67 (±14) years) were included. The mean observed sedation period was 224 (±139) hours. To achieve the prescribed sedation level, we observed the need for two or three sedatives in 48.7% and 12.8% of the cases, respectively. In cases with a triple sedation regimen, the combination of clonidine, esketamine and midazolam was observed in most cases (75.7%). Analgesia was achieved using sufentanil in 98.6% of the cases. The analysis showed that the majority of COVID-19 patients required an unusually high sedation dose compared to those available in the literature.The global pandemic continues to affect patients severely requiring ventilation and sedation, but optimal sedation strategies are still lacking. The findings of our observation suggest unusual high dosages of sedatives in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. Prescribed sedation levels appear to be achievable only with several combinations of sedatives in most critically ill patients suffering from COVID-19-induced ARDS and a potential association to the often required sophisticated critical care including prone positioning and ECMO treatment seems conceivable."
https://openalex.org/W3186053381,"More than 60% of pharmaceuticals are related to natural products (NPs), chemicals produced by living organisms. Despite this, the rate of NP discovery has slowed over the past few decades. In many cases the rate-limiting step in NP discovery is structural characterization. Here we report the use of microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), an emerging cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM) method, in combination with genome mining to accelerate NP discovery and structural elucidation. As proof of principle we rapidly determine the structure of a new 2-pyridone NP, Py-469, and revise the structure of fischerin, an NP isolated more than 25 years ago, with potent cytotoxicity but hitherto ambiguous structural assignment. This study serves as a powerful demonstration of the synergy of MicroED and synthetic biology in NP discovery, technologies that when taken together will ultimately accelerate the rate at which new drugs are discovered."
https://openalex.org/W3184798860,"Drawing on the knowledge-based view and ability-based theories of emotional intelligence (EI), in this study, we investigate the effects of EI on learning outcomes related to academics and administrators in Chinese research universities and we also test the direct association between learning outcomes and creative performance. In addition, we examine the mediating role of self-directed learning (SDL) and knowledge management processes (KMPs) on the relationship between EI and learning outcomes.The sample, for this study, consisted of 547 academic and administrative personnel at Chinese higher educational institutions (HEIs), and the hypothesized associations were examined through partial least squares structural equation modeling.Our results indicated that EI has no significant influence on learning outcomes. However, an indirect relationship between EI and learning outcomes is established through SDL and KMPs.This study strengthens the professional understanding of EI and supports that the personnel at HEIs should value SDL and KMPs, which in turn enhances their learning outcomes. Although EI has received increased importance in higher education institutions, there are few studies that have investigated the relationship of EI, SDL, KMP, and learning outcomes. This is one of the initial studies that has empirically examined the interface of EI and learning outcomes in HEIs and also provides timely insights into the understanding of the mediating role of SDL and KMP."
https://openalex.org/W3185595854,"This paper offers insights on the major issues and challenges firms face in the Covid-19 pandemic and their concerns for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) themes. To do so, we investigate large Italian firms’ discussions on Twitter in the first nine months of the pandemic. Specifically, we ask: How is firms’ Twitter discussion developing during the Covid-19 pandemic? Which CSR dimensions and topics do firms discuss? To what extent do they resonate with the public? We downloaded Twitter posts by the accounts of large Italian firms, and we built the bipartite network of accounts and hashtags. Using an entropy-based null model as a benchmark, we projected the information contained in the network into the accounts layers, identifying a network of accounts. We find that the network is composed of 13 communities and accounts at the core of the network focus on environmental sustainability, digital innovation, and safety. Firms’ ownership type does not seem to influence the conversation. While the relevance of CSR hashtags and stakeholder engagement is relatively small, peculiarities arise in some communities. Overall, our paper highlights the contribution of online social networks and complex networks methods for management and strategy research, showing the role of online social media in understanding firms’ issues, challenges, and responsibilities, with common narratives naturally emerging from data."
https://openalex.org/W3184209018,"Background The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is posing major challenges for health care systems. In Germany, one such challenge has been that adequate palliative care for the severely ill and dying (with and without COVID-19), as well as their loved ones, has not been available at all times and in all settings., the pandemic has underlined the significance of the contribution of general practitioners (GPs) to the care of severely ill and dying patients. Objectives To describe GPs’ experiences, challenges and perspectives with respect to end-of-life care during the first peak of the pandemic (spring 2020) in Germany. Materials and methods In November and December 2020, a link to an Unipark online survey was sent to GPs registered on nationwide distribution lists. Results In total, 410 GPs responded; 61.5% indicated that the quality of their patients’ end-of-life care was maintained throughout the pandemic, 36.8% reported a decrease in quality compared to pre-pandemic times. Of the GPs who made home visits to severely ill and dying patients, 61.4% reported a stable number of visits, 28.5% reported fewer visits. 62.7% of the GPs reported increased telephone contact and reduced personal contact with patients; 36.1% offered video consultations in lieu of face-to-face contact. The GPs reported that relatives were restricted (48.5%) or prohibited from visiting (33.4%) patients in nursing homes. They observed a fear of loneliness among patients in nursing homes (91.9%), private homes (87.3%) and hospitals (86.1%). Conclusions The present work provides insights into the pandemic management of GPs and supports the development of a national strategy for palliative care during a pandemic. To effectively address end-of-life care, GPs and palliative care specialists should be involved in COVID-19 task forces on micro, meso and macro levels of health care."
https://openalex.org/W3183824435,"Retinal ischemia is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Inner retinal dysfunction including loss of retinal ganglion cells is encountered in a number of retinal ischemic disorders. We previously reported administration of two different hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) inhibitors exerted neuroprotective effects in a murine model of retinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) which mimics these disorders, as inner retinal degeneration could be involved in pathological HIF induction. However, this notion needs further investigation. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to use retina-specific Hif-1α conditional knockout (cKO) mice to uncover this notion more clearly under the same condition. Hif-1α cKO mice showed inner retinal neurodegeneration to a lesser extent than control mice. Hif-1α depletion in a murine 661W retinal cell line reduced cell death under pseudohypoxic and hypoxic conditions. Among hypoxia-related genes, the expression of BCL2 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (Bnip3) was substantially upregulated in the inner retinal layer after retinal I/R. In this regard, we further examined Bnip3 depletion in retinal neurons in vitro and in vivo and found the similar neuroprotective effects. Our results support the notion that the HIF-1α/BNIP3 pathway may have a critical role in inner retinal neurodegeneration, which can be linked with the development of new promising therapeutics for inner retinal ischemic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3184153873,"Sustainability in livestock farming requires monitoring of autochthonous breeds which are well adapted to the local environment. The morphometric measurements seem to be the first approach which can provide useful information on the suitability of animal genetic resources for selection. In this work, thirteen morphometric variables were used for the phenotypic characterization of 130 adult autochthones cattle randomly selected from 30 local farms in Guelma. There were cases from four commonly accepted and traditional ecotypes: Guelmois, Cheurfa, Sétifien and Fawn. The results showed several and significant positive correlations between the different variables. Correlations were analyzed using Varimax orthogonal rotation PCA and three factors were extracted, which explain more than 75% of the total variation in the four ecotypes. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that 6 of the 13 variables had discriminatory power to define the phenotypic profile of the ecotypes. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that the Sétifien ecotype is separate from the other three ecotypes. Mahalanobis distances were significant between the different ecotypes except for the distance between the Guelmois and Fawn ecotypes. The cross-validation procedure assigned 91.42% of the Sétifien animals to their genetic group, while the percentages of animals assigned to the Cheurfa, Guelmois and Fawn ecotypes were 80.00%, 65.71% and 53.33% respectively. The multivariate approach has proven to be effective in differentiating the four ecotypes, with clear morphological differences from the Sétifien ecotype that may benefit from a genetic improvement program for more sustainable genetic resources preservation."
https://openalex.org/W3185885686,"Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). Aquaporin (AQP)-1 water channel in the kidney is critical for the maintenance of water homeostasis and the urinary concentrating ability. Increasing evidence supports an important role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of AKI induced by renal I/R. The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether activation of autophagy prevents downregulation of AQP1 protein induced by renal I/R and potential molecular mechanisms. Renal I/R induced consistently reduced protein expression of AQP1, 2, and 3, as well as sodium cotransporters Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter and α-Na,K-ATPase, which was associated with increased urine output and decreased creatinine clearance in rats. Renal I/R also suppressed autophagy and increased inflammatory responses in the kidney. 4-Benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione (TDZD-8), the glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitor, ameliorated renal injury under I/R, activated autophagy and markedly increased expression of AQPs and sodium transporters in the kidney, which was associated with improved urine output and creatinine clearance in rats. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induced suppression of autophagy and downregulation of AQP1 in murine inner medullary collecting duct 3 (IMCD3) cells, which was fully prevented by TDZD-8 treatment. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine or Atg5 gene knockdown attenuated recovery of AQP1 protein expression induced by TDZD-8 in IMCD3 cells with H/R. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) decreased the abundance of AQP1 protein in IMCD3 cells. H/R induced increases in protein expression of nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 and IL-1β, which was reversed by TDZD-8. In conclusion, TDZD-8 treatment prevented downregulation of AQP1 expression under renal I/R injury, likely via activating autophagy and decreasing IL-1β production."
https://openalex.org/W3185910024,"Health literacy is a concept that refers to patients' ability to manage their disease and the health system's ability to guarantee access to services. There is evidence that health literacy impacts the health outcomes of patients with chronic diseases, but detailed information on this topic in patients with liver cirrhosis is scarce. It was the aim of this study to identify risk factors for poorer health literacy in patients with liver cirrhosis.89 patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled in this study and health literacy was measured using the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). Covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) was diagnosed clinically according to the West-Haven Criteria (HE grade 1) and the PHES (minimal HE). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Based on the nine subscales of the HLQ, risk factors for poor health literacy were identified using linear regression models.Normalized HLQ scores ranged between 65-76%, while appraisal of health information had lowest score (65%) and ability to actively engage with healthcare providers had highest score (76%). Multivariable regression analyses revealed an association of poorer health literacy and liver function as determined by MELD score and complications of liver cirrhosis such as a history of ascites or CHE. Additionally, we identified modifiable or preventable factors such as depressive symptoms, a history of falls, and active smoking as risk factors for poorer health literacy.Multiple factors seem to impact on health literacy in patients with liver cirrhosis. Addressing modifiable and preventable factors may improve health literacy."
https://openalex.org/W3185954314,"Background The outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic lead to high levels of morbidity and mortality around the globe. Consequences of this outbreak and possible associated infection are an increase in mental health disorders and an increased likelihood of internalizing problems, particularly depression. However, to date few studies have tested this hypothesis while taking into account individuals’ preexisting mental health difficulties. Methods We used longitudinal data collected among 729 persons in the context of the French TEMPO cohort between March and June 2020 (7 waves of data collection). COVID-19-like symptoms as well as anxiety/depression (assessed by the Adult Self Report), were reported at each wave of data collection. To study the relationship between COVID-19-like symptoms and anxiety/depression, we used generalized estimation equation (GEE) models controlled for socio-demographic and health-related characteristics, including anxiety/depression prior to 2020. Results Overall, 27.2% of study participants reported anxiety/depression during lockdown. 17.1% of participants reported COVID-19-like symptoms during the course of follow-up, 7.3% after the beginning of lockdown, with an average number of 2.7 symptoms, and 3.6% reported respiratory distress. In multivariate analyses, nearly all the considered indicators of COVID-19-like symptoms were associated with higher odds of symptoms of anxiety/depression (symptoms Yes/No: OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.08–2.55; symptoms after the beginning of lockdown: OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.03–3.52; number of symptoms: OR for each additional symptom = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.02–1.39. This relationship exists after taking into account prior symptoms of anxiety/depression, which are associated with a 5-fold increased likelihood of psychological distress. And this impact is stronger among men than women. Conclusions Our study shows higher risk of anxiety/depression among persons who experienced COVID-19-like symptoms, even after accounting for prior mental health difficulties. COVID-19 infection could have both a direct and indirect impact on the occurrence of psychological difficulties, and this association should be studied in greater detail."
https://openalex.org/W3185768419,"The purpose of this study was to compare step-by-step kinematics of normal and assisted 60 m sprints with different loads in experienced sprinters. Step-by-step kinematics were measured using inertial measuring units (IMU) integrated with a 3-axis gyroscope and a laser gun in 24 national level male and female sprinters during a normal 60 m sprint and sprints with a 3, 4, and 5 kg pulling force. The main findings were that using increasing assisted loads resulted in faster 60 m times, as a result of higher step velocity mainly caused by longer step lengths in both genders and by shorter contact times in women. Men had longer step lengths, longer contact times, and shorter flight times than women. However, the assisted loads had a greater effect on women than on men, as shown by their larger decrease in sprint times. These time differences in gender were the result of more and longer duration increases in maximal step velocity with increasing assisted loads for women (70-80% of distance) than men (65-70% of distance). This was mainly caused by shorter contact times, and by more increased step lengths in women compared to men. In terms of practical application, it is notable that employing this approach, when using assisted loads can help athletes to reach higher step velocities and hold this for longer, which may be a training impulse to move the speed barrier upwards."
https://openalex.org/W3183303193,"Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important industrial and staple crop due to its high starch content, low input requirement, and resilience which makes it an ideal crop for sustainable agricultural systems and marginal lands in the tropics. However, the lack of genomic information on local genetic resources has impeded efficient conservation and improvement of the crop and the exploration of its full agronomic and breeding potential. This work was carried out to obtain information on population structure and extent of genetic variability among some local landraces conserved at the Plant Genetic Resources Research Institute, Ghana and exotic cassava accessions with Diversity Array Technology based SilicoDArT and SNP markers to infer how the relatedness in the genetic materials can be used to enhance germplasm curation and future breeding efforts. A total of 10521 SilicoDArT and 10808 SNP markers were used with varying polymorphic information content (PIC) values. The average PIC was 0.36 and 0.28 for the SilicoDArT and SNPs respectively. Population structure and average linkage hierarchical clustering based on SNPs revealed two distinct subpopulations and a large number of admixtures. Both DArT platforms identified 22 landraces as potential duplicates based on Gower's genetic dissimilarity. The expected heterozygosity which defines the genetic variation within each subpopulation was 0.008 for subpop1 which were mainly landraces and 0.391 for subpop2 indicating the homogeneous and admixture nature of the two subpopulations. Further analysis upon removal of the duplicates increased the expected heterozygosity of subpop1 from 0.008 to 0.357. A mantel test indicated strong interdependence (r = 0.970; P < 0.001) between SilicoDArT and DArTSeq SNP genotypic data suggesting both marker platforms as a robust system for genomic studies in cassava. These findings provide important information for efficient ex-situ conservation of cassava, future heterosis breeding, and marker-assisted selection (MAS) to enhance cassava improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3185578581,"This study is to assess the influences of climate, socio-economic determinants, and spatial distance on the confirmed cases and deaths in the raise phase of COVID-19 in China. The positive confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 over the population size of 100,000 over every 5 consecutive days (the CCOPSPTT and DOPSPTT for short, respectively) covered from 25th January to 29th February, 2020 in five city types ( i . e ., small-, medium-, large-, very large- and super large-sized cities), along with the data of climate, socio-economic determinants, spatial distance of the target city to Wuhan city (DW, for short), and spatial distance between the target city and their local province capital city (DLPC, for short) were collected from the official websites of China. Then the above-mentioned influencing factors on CCOPSPTT and DOPSPTT were analyzed separately in Hubei and other provinces. The results showed that CCOPSPTT and DOPSPTT were significantly different among five city types outside Hubei province ( p &lt; 0.05), but not obviously different in Hubei province ( p &gt; 0.05). The CCOPSPTT had significant correlation with socio-economic determinants (GDP and population), DW, climate and time after the outbreak of COVID-19 outside Hubei province ( p &lt; 0.05), while was only significantly related with GDP in Hubei province ( p &lt; 0.05). The DOPSPTT showed significant correlation with socio-economic determinants, DW, time and CCOPSPTT outside Hubei province ( p &lt; 0.05), while was significantly correlated with GDP and CCOPSPTT in Hubei province ( p &lt; 0.05). Compared with other factors, socio-economic determinants have the largest relative contribution to variance of CCOPSPTT in all studied cities (&gt; 78%). The difference of DOPSPTT among cities was mainly affected by CCOPSPTT. Our results showed that influences of city types on the confirmed cases and death differed between Hubei and other provinces. Socio-economic determinants, especially GDP, have higher impact on the change of COVID-19 transmission compared with other factors."
https://openalex.org/W3185762914,"The incredible mechanical strength and durability of mature fibrous tissues and their extremely limited turnover and regenerative capacity underscores the importance of proper matrix assembly during early postnatal growth. In tissues with composite extracellular matrix (ECM) structures, such as the adult knee meniscus, fibrous (Collagen-I rich), and cartilaginous (Collagen-II, proteoglycan-rich) matrix components are regionally segregated to the outer and inner portions of the tissue, respectively. While this spatial variation in composition is appreciated to be functionally important for resisting complex mechanical loads associated with gait, the establishment of these specialized zones is poorly understood. To address this issue, the following study tracked the growth of the murine meniscus from its embryonic formation through its first month of growth, encompassing the critical time-window during which animals begin to ambulate and weight bear. Using histological analysis, region specific high-throughput qPCR, and Col-1, and Col-2 fluorescent reporter mice, we found that matrix and cellular features defining specific tissue zones were already present at birth, before continuous weight-bearing had occurred. These differences in meniscus zones were further refined with postnatal growth and maturation, resulting in specialization of mature tissue regions. Taken together, this work establishes a detailed timeline of the concurrent spatiotemporal changes that occur at both the cellular and matrix level throughout meniscus maturation. The findings of this study provide a framework for investigating the reciprocal feedback between cells and their evolving microenvironments during assembly of a mechanically robust fibrocartilage tissue, thus providing insight into mechanisms of tissue degeneration and effective regenerative strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3186706997,"An efficient automatic decision support system for detection of retinal disorders is important and is the need of the hour. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the current imaging modality for the early detection of retinal disorders non-invasively.

The hyperparameters of the model like batch size, number of epochs, dropout rate, and the type of optimizer are tuned using random search optimization method for better performance to classify different retinal disorders. The proposed architecture provides an accuracy of 97.01%, sensitivity of 93.43%, and 98.07% specificity and it outperformed other existing models, when compared.

https://openalex.org/W3184909617,"An array of isoforms of the nuclear estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α) protein contribute to heterogeneous response in breast cancer (BCa); yet, a single-cell analysis tool that distinguishes the full-length ER-α66 protein from the activation function-1 deficient ER-α46 isoform has not been reported. Specific detection of protein isoforms is a gap in single-cell analysis tools, as the de facto standard immunoassay requires isoform-specific antibody probes. Consequently, to scrutinize hormone response heterogeneity among BCa tumor cells, we develop a precision tool to specifically measure ER-α66, ER- α46, and eight ER-signaling proteins with single-cell resolution in the highly hetero-clonal MCF-7 BCa cell line. With a literature-validated pan-ER immunoprobe, we distinguish ER-α66 from ER-α46 in each individual cell. We identify ER-α46 in 5.5% of hormone-sensitive (MCF-7) and 4.2% of hormone-insensitive (MDA-MB-231) BCa cell lines. To examine whether the single-cell immunoblotting can capture cellular responses to hormones, we treat cells with tamoxifen and identify different sub-populations of ER-α46: (i) ER-α46 induces phospho-AKT at Ser473, (ii) S6-ribosomal protein, an upstream ER target, activates both ER-α66 and ER-α46 in MCF-7 cells, and (iii) ER-α46 partitions MDA-MB-231 subpopulations, which are responsive to tamoxifen. Unlike other single-cell immunoassays, multiplexed single-cell immunoblotting reports–in the same cell–tamoxifen effects on ER signaling proteins and on distinct isoforms of the ER-α protein."
https://openalex.org/W3185628635,"Heparan sulfate (HS), a highly sulfated linear polysaccharide, is involved in diverse biological functions in various tissues. Although previous studies have suggested a possible contribution of HS to the differentiation of white adipocytes, there has been no direct evidence supporting this. Here, we inhibited the synthesis of HS chains in 3T3-L1 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, resulting in impaired differentiation of adipocytes with attenuated bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)-fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling pathways. HS reduction resulted in reduced glucose uptake and decreased insulin-dependent intracellular signaling. We then made heterozygous mutant mice for the Ext1 gene, which encodes an enzyme essential for the HS biosynthesis, specifically in the visceral white adipose tissue (Fabp4-Cre+::Ext1flox/WT mice, hereafter called Ext1Δ/WT) to confirm the importance of HS in vivo. The expression levels of transcription factors that control adipocyte differentiation, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, were reduced in Ext1Δ/WT adipocytes, which contained smaller, unilocular lipid droplets, reduced levels of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis, and altered expression of BMP4-FGF1 signaling molecules. Furthermore, we examined the impact of HS reduction in visceral white adipose tissue on systemic glucose homeostasis. We observed that Ext1Δ/WT mice showed glucose intolerance because of insulin resistance. Our results demonstrate that HS plays a crucial role in the differentiation of white adipocytes through BMP4-FGF1 signaling pathways, thereby contributing to insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3185935247,"Banana is one of the most important fruit crops consumed globally owing to its high nutritional value. Previously, we demonstrated that the ripe pulp of the banana cultivar (cv.) Nendran (AAB) contained a high amount of pro-vitamin A carotenoids. However, the molecular factors involved in the ripening process in Nendran fruit are unexplored. Hence, we commenced a transcriptome study by using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 at two stages i.e. unripe and ripe fruit-pulp of Nendran. Overall, 3474 up and 4727 down-regulated genes were obtained. A large number of identified transcripts were related to genes involved in ripening, cell wall degradation and aroma formation. Gene ontology analysis highlighted differentially expressed genes that play a key role in various pathways. These pathways were mainly linked to cellular, molecular and biological processes. The present transcriptome study also reveals a crucial role of up-regulated carotenoid biosynthesis pathway genes namely, lycopene beta cyclase and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase at the ripening stage. Genes related to the ripening and other processes like aroma and flavor were highly expressed in the ripe pulp. Expression of numerous transcription factor family genes was also identified. This study lays a path towards understanding the ripening, carotenoid accumulation and other related processes in banana."
https://openalex.org/W3186244443,"The risk of alcohol dependence (AD) in Japanese men and women was evaluated according to combinations of alcohol flushing and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2, rs671) and alcohol dehydrogenase-1B (ADH1B, rs1229984) genotypes, all of which are known to determine AD susceptibility in Asians. Previous studies have focused on men, since women account for a smaller proportion of AD subjects.Case control studies were conducted between 3721 male and 335 female AD Japanese and 610 male and 406 female controls who were asked about their current or former tendency to experience facial flushing after drinking a glass of beer and underwent ALDH2 and ADH1B genotyping. The time at which alcohol-induced facial flushing tendencies had disappeared in former-flushing AD subjects was also evaluated.Current alcohol flushing, the inactive ALDH2*1/*2 genotype, and the fast-metabolizing ADH1B*2 allele were less frequently found in the AD groups. Although alcohol flushing was strongly influenced by the ALDH2 and ADH1B genotypes, multiple logistic model showed that never or former flushing and the genotype combinations were independent strong risk factors of AD in men and women. Never or former flushing (vs. current flushing) markedly increased the odds ratios of AD in carriers of each of the ALDH2 and ADH1B genotype combinations. The temporal profiles for drinking and flushing in former-flushing AD subjects revealed that the flushing response disappeared soon after or before the start of habitual drinking during young adulthood, regardless of the ALDH2 genotype.Although alcohol flushing is influenced by the ALDH2 and ADH1B genotypes, constitutional or acquired flushing tolerance is an independent susceptibility trait for AD. The combination of the alcohol flushing status and the ALDH2 and ADH1B genotypes can provide a better new strategy for AD risk assessment than the alcohol flushing status alone or the genotypes alone in Asian men and women."
https://openalex.org/W3124064374,"Acquiring high-quality RNA in sufficient amounts is crucial in plant molecular biology and genetic studies. Several methods for RNA extraction from plants are available in the literature, mainly due to the great biochemical diversity present in each species and tissue, which can complicate or prevent the extraction. Psidium guajava (Myrtaceae family) is a perennial fruit tree of medicinal and economic value; nevertheless, only a few molecular studies are available for the species. One reason is the difficulty in obtaining RNA due to the content of the samples, which are rich in polyphenols, polysaccharides, and secondary metabolites. Furthermore, there are few studies available for the isolation of RNA from guava or Psidium samples, which hampers advances in the study of the genus. Here, quality and yields of RNA isolates were compared using six extraction protocols: two protocols based on the application of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) lysis buffer, one protocol which uses the TRIzol reagent, one which applies guanidine thiocyanate lysis buffer followed by organic phase extraction, and two commercial kits (PureLink RNA Mini Kit and RNeasy Plant Mini Kit). The CTAB-based method provided the highest RNA yields and quality for five different tissues (flower bud, immature leaf, young leaf, mature leaf, and root), genotypes, and stress conditions. For the most efficient protocol, the average yield of RNA from guava leaves was 203.06 μg/g of tissue, and the A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios were 2.1 and 2.2, respectively. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the purity of the samples was sufficient for molecular biology experiments. CTAB-based methods for RNA isolation were found to be the most efficient, providing the highest RNA yields and quality for tissues from P. guajava. Additionally, they were compatible for downstream RNA-based applications, besides being simple and cost-effective."
https://openalex.org/W3183657029,"Behavioural patterns are typically derived using unsupervised multivariate methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), latent profile analysis (LPA) and cluster analysis (CA). Comparability and congruence between the patterns derived from these methods has not been previously investigated, thus it's unclear whether patterns from studies using different methods are directly comparable. This study aimed to compare behavioural patterns derived across diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep domains, using PCA, LPA and CA in a single dataset.Parent-report and accelerometry data from the second wave (2011/12; child age 6-8y, n = 432) of the HAPPY cohort study (Melbourne, Australia) were used to derive behavioural patterns using PCA, LPA and CA. Standardized variables assessing diet (intake of fruit, vegetable, sweet, and savoury discretionary items), physical activity (moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity [MVPA] from accelerometry, organised sport duration and outdoor playtime from parent report), sedentary behaviour (sedentary time from accelerometry, screen time, videogames and quiet playtime from parent report) and sleep (daily sleep duration) were included in the analyses. For each method, commonly used criteria for pattern retention were applied.PCA produced four patterns whereas LPA and CA each generated three patterns. Despite the number and characterisation of the behavioural patterns derived being non-identical, each method identified a healthy, unhealthy and a mixed pattern. Three common underlying themes emerged across the methods for each type of pattern: (i) High fruit and vegetable intake and high outdoor play (""healthy""); (ii) poor diet (either low fruit and vegetable intake or high discretionary food intake) and high sedentary behaviour (""unhealthy""); and (iii) high MVPA, poor diet (as defined above) and low sedentary time (""mixed"").Within this sample, despite differences in the number of patterns derived by each method, a good degree of concordance across pattern characteristics was seen between the methods. Differences between patterns could be attributable to the underpinning statistical technique of each method. Therefore, acknowledging the differences between the methods and ensuring thorough documentation of the pattern derivation analyses is essential to inform comparison of patterns derived through a range of approaches across studies."
https://openalex.org/W3186256423,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH), a rare but deadly cardiopulmonary disorder, is characterized by extensive remodeling of pulmonary arteries resulting from enhancement of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis; however, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Recently, epigenetics has gained increasing prominence in the development of PH. We aimed to investigate the role of vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4) in chronic normobaric hypoxia (CNH)-induced PH and to address whether it is associated with epigenetic regulation. The rodent model of PH was established by CNH treatment (10% O2, 23 hours/day). Western blot, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and adeno-associated virus tests were performed to explore the potential mechanisms involved in CNH-induced PH in mice. VGLL4 expression was upregulated and correlated with CNH in PH mouse lung tissues in a time-dependent manner. VGLL4 colocalized with α-smooth muscle actin in cultured pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), and VGLL4 immunoactivity was increased in PASMCs following hypoxia exposure in vitro. VGLL4 knockdown attenuated CNH-induced PH and pulmonary artery remodeling by blunting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling; conversely, VGLL4 overexpression exacerbated the development of PH. CNH enhanced the acetylation of VGLL4 and increased the interaction of ac-H3K9/VGLL4 and ac-H3K9/STAT3 in the lung tissues, and levels of ac-H3K9, p-STAT3/STAT3, and proliferation-associated protein levels were markedly up-regulated, whereas apoptosis-related protein levels were significantly downregulated, in the lung tissues of mice with CNH-induced PH. Notably, abrogation of VGLL4 acetylation reversed CNH-induced PH and pulmonary artery remodeling and suppressed STAT3 signaling. Finally, STAT3 knockdown alleviated CNH-induced PH. In conclusion, VGLL4 acetylation upregulation could contribute to CNH-induced PH and pulmonary artery remodeling via STAT3 signaling, and abrogation of VGLL4 acetylation reversed CNH-induced PH. Pharmacological or genetic deletion of VGLL4 might be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in CNH-induced PH."
https://openalex.org/W3184463797,"While biglycan (BGN) is suggested to direct diverse signaling cascades, the effects of soluble BGN as a ligand on metabolic traits have not been studied. Herein, we tested the effects of BGN on obesity in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese animals and glucose metabolism, with the underlying mechanism responsible for observed effects in vitro. Our results showed that BGN administration (1 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) significantly prevented HFD-induced obesity, and this was mainly attributed to reduced food intake. Also, intracerebroventricular injection of BGN reduced food intake and body weight. The underlying mechanism includes modulation of neuropeptides gene expression involved in appetite in the hypothalamus in vitro and in vivo. In addition, BGN regulates glucose metabolism as shown by improved glucose tolerance in mice as well as AMPK/AKT dual pathway-driven enhanced glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation in L6 myoblast cells. In conclusion, our results suggest BGN as a potential therapeutic target to treat risk factors for metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3184627662,"Fasting stimulates catabolic reactions in skeletal muscle to survive nutrient deprivation. Cellular phospholipids have large structural diversity due to various polar-heads and acyl-chains that affect many cellular functions. Skeletal muscle phospholipid profiles have been suggested to be associated with muscle adaptations to nutritional and environmental status. However, the effect of fasting on skeletal muscle phospholipid profiles remains unknown. Here, we analyzed phospholipids using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. We determined that fasting resulted in a decrease in 22:6-containing phosphatidylcholines (PCs) (22:6-PCs) and an increase in 18:2-containing PCs (18:2-PCs). The fasting-induced increase in 18:2-PCs was sufficient to complement 22:6-PCs loss, resulting in the maintenance of the total amount of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing PCs. Similar phospholipid alterations occurred in insulin-deficient mice, which indicate that these observed phospholipid perturbations were characteristic of catabolic skeletal muscle. In lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 3-knockout muscles that mostly lack 22:6-PCs, other PUFA-containing PCs, mainly 18:2-PCs, accumulated. This suggests a compensatory mechanism for skeletal muscles to maintain PUFA-containing PCs."
https://openalex.org/W3184723361,"A major complication of sepsis is the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). Recently, it was shown that intracellular actin released from damaged tissues appears in the urine of patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Our aims were to measure urinary actin (u-actin) concentrations of septic and control patients and to test if u-actin levels could predict AKI and mortality.Blood and urine samples were collected from septic and sepsis-related AKI patients at three time points (T1-3): T1: within 24 hours after admission; T2: second day morning; T3: third day morning of follow-up. Patients with malignancies needing palliative care, end-stage renal disease or kidney transplantation were excluded. Serum and u-actin levels were determined by quantitative Western blot. Patients were categorized by the Sepsis-3 and KDIGO AKI classifications.In our study, 17 septic, 43 sepsis-induced AKI and 24 control patients were enrolled. U-actin levels were higher in septic patients compared with controls during follow-up (p<0.001). At T1, the septic and sepsis-related AKI groups also showed differences (p<0.001), yet this increase was not statistically significant at T2 and T3. We also detected significantly elevated u-actin concentrations in AKI-2 and AKI-3 septic patients compared with AKI-1 septic patients (p<0.05) at T1 and T3, along with a significant increase in AKI-2 septic patients compared with AKI-1 septic patients at T2 (p<0.01). This tendency remained the same when referring u-actin to urine creatinine. Parameters of first-day septic patient samples could discriminate AKI from non-AKI state (AUC ROC, p<0.001): u-actin: 0.876; se-creatinine: 0.875. Derived cut-off value for u-actin was 2.63 μg/L (sensitivity: 86.0%, specificity: 82.4%).U-actin may be a complementary diagnostic biomarker to se-creatinine in sepsis-related AKI while higher u-actin levels also seem to reflect the severity of AKI. Further investigations may elucidate the importance of u-actin release in sepsis-related AKI."
https://openalex.org/W3185842292,"Although statistical regularities in the environment often go explicitly unnoticed, traces of implicit learning are evident in our neural activity. Recent perspectives have offered evidence that both pre-stimulus oscillations and peri-stimulus event-related potentials are reliable biomarkers of implicit expectations arising from statistical learning. What remains ambiguous, however, is the origination and development of these implicit expectations. To address this lack of knowledge and determine the temporal constraints of expectation formation, pre-stimulus increases in alpha/beta power were investigated alongside a reduction in the N170 and a suppression in peri-/post-stimulus gamma power. Electroencephalography was acquired from naive participants who engaged in a gender classification task. Participants were uninformed, that eight face images were sorted into four reoccurring pairs which were pseudorandomly hidden amongst randomly occurring face images. We found a reduced N170 for statistically expected images at left parietal and temporo-parietal electrodes. Furthermore, enhanced gamma power following the presentation of random images emphasized the bottom-up processing of these arbitrary occurrences. In contrast, enhanced alpha/beta power was evident pre-stimulus for expected relative to random faces. A particularly interesting finding was the early onset of alpha/beta power enhancement which peaked immediately after the depiction of the predictive face. Hence, our findings propose an approximate timeframe throughout which consistent traces of enhanced alpha/beta power illustrate the early prioritisation of top-down processes to facilitate the development of implicitly cued face-related expectations."

We conducted a comparative demonstration study of the applicability of an internationally validated standardised service classification instrument-the Description and Evaluation of Services and Directories-DESDE-LTC) using the emerging mental health ecosystems research (MHESR) approach. Using DESDE-LTC as the framework, and drawing from international occupation classifications, the workforce was classified according to characteristics including the type of care provided and professional background. Our reference area was the Australian Capital Territory, which we compared with two other urban districts in Australia (Sydney and South East Sydney) and three benchmark international health districts (Helsinki-Uusima (Finland), Verona (Italy) and Gipuzkoa (Spain)). We also compared our data with national level data where available. The Australian and Finnish regions had a larger and more highly skilled workforce than the southern European regions. The pattern of workforce availability and profile varied, even within the same country, at the local level. We found significant differences between regional rates of identified rates of psychiatrists and psychologists, and national averages. Using a standardised classification instrument at the local level, and our occupational groupings, we were able to assess the available workforce and provide information relevant to planners about the actual capacity of the system. Data obtained at local level is critical to providing planners with reliable data to inform their decision making."

We characterized the mitochondrial genome of Geomydoecus aurei, a chewing louse (Phthiraptera: Trichodectidae) found on pocket gophers (Rodentia: Geomyidae) using reads from both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing coupled with PCR, cloning, and Sanger sequencing to verify structure and arrangement for each chromosome. The genome consisted of 12 circular mitochondrial chromosomes ranging in size from 1,318 to 2,088 nucleotides (nt). Total genome size was 19,015 nt. All 37 genes typical of metazoans (2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and 13 protein-coding genes) were present. An average of 26% of each chromosome was composed of non-gene sequences. Within the non-gene region of each chromosome, there was a 79-nt nucleotide sequence that was identical among chromosomes and a conserved sequence with secondary structure that was always followed by a poly-T region. We hypothesize that these regions may be important in the initiation of transcription and DNA replication, respectively. The G. aurei genome shares 8 derived gene clusters with other chewing lice of mammals, but in G. aurei, genes on several chromosomes are not contiguous."

Both used a two-stage cluster sampling design to randomly select participants. This analysis is limited to women married or in union. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was used to compare the military and non-military populations.The socio-demographic profile of women in the military camps differed between 2016 and 2019, which may reflect the more mobile nature of this population. In both populations, knowledge of modern contraceptive methods increased significantly. Similarly, use of a modern contraceptive method also increased significantly in both, though by 2019 women in the military camps were less likely to use modern contraception (24.9%) than their non-military counterparts (29.7%). Multivariate analysis showed no significant difference in the amount of increase in MCPR for the two populations. Among contraceptive users in both populations, the implant was the leading method. Potential effects of FP programming were evident in the military population: exposure to FP messaging increased (in comparison to a decrease among the non-military population). Moreover, women who had lived in the camps for 4+ years had a higher MCPR than those living in the camps for less than four years.This study demonstrates the feasibility and importance of collecting data in military camps for better understanding contraceptive dynamics among this specialized population."
https://openalex.org/W3183822812,"Introduction Aortic dissection (AD) is a life-threatening emergency, and lumican (LUM) is a potential Biomarker for AD diagnosis. We investigated LUM expression patterns in patients with AD and explored the molecular functions of Lum in AD mice model. Methods LUM expression patterns were analyzed using aortic tissues of AD patients, and serum soluble LUM (s-LUM) levels were compared between patients with acute AD (AAD) and chronic AD (CAD). Lum -knockout ( Lum −/− ) mice were challenged with β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) and angiotensin II (Ang II) to induce AD. The survival rate, AD incidence, and aortic aneurysm (AA) in these mice were compared with those in BAPN–Ang II–challenged wildtype ( WT ) mice. Tgf-β/Smad2, Mmps, Lum, and Nox expression patterns were examined. Results LUM expression was detected in the intima and media of the ascending aorta in patients with AAD. Serum s-LUM levels were significantly higher in patients with AAD than CAD. Furthermore, AD-associated mortality and thoracic aortic rupture incidence were significantly higher in the Lum −/− AD mice than in the WT AD mice. However, no significant pathologic changes in AA were observed in the Lum −/− AD mice compared with the WT AD mice. The BAPN–Ang II–challenged WT and Lum −/− AD mice had higher Tgf-β, p-Smad2, Mmp2, Mmp9, and Nox4 levels than those of non-AD mice. We also found that Lum expression was significantly higher in the BAPN-Ang II–challenged WT in comparison to the unchallenged WT mice. Conclusion LUM expression was altered in patients with AD display increased s-LUM in blood, and Lum −/− mice exhibited augmented AD pathogenesis. These findings support the notion that LUM is a biomarker signifying the pathogenesis of injured aorta seen in AAD. The presence of LUM is essential for maintenance of connective tissue integrity. Future studies should elucidate the mechanisms underlying LUM association in aortic changes."
https://openalex.org/W3183962549,"The Src homology 2 containing inositol 5-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) is a large multidomain enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) to form PI(3,4)P2. PI(3,4,5)P3 is a key lipid second messenger controlling the recruitment of signaling proteins to the plasma membrane, thereby regulating a plethora of cellular events, including proliferation, growth, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. SHIP2, alongside PI3K and PTEN, regulates PI(3,4,5)P3 levels at the plasma membrane and has been heavily implicated in serious diseases such as cancer and type 2 diabetes; however, many aspects of its regulation mechanism remain elusive. We recently reported an activating effect of the SHIP2 C2 domain and here we describe an additional layer of regulation via the pleckstrin homology-related (PHR) domain. We show a phosphoinositide-induced transition to a high activity state of the enzyme that increases phosphatase activity up to 10-15 fold. We further show that PI(3,4)P2 directly interacts with the PHR domain to trigger this allosteric activation. Modeling of the PHR-phosphatase-C2 region of SHIP2 on the membrane suggests no major inter-domain interactions with the PHR domain, but close contacts between the two linkers offer a possible path of allosteric communication. Together, our data show that the PHR domain acts as an allosteric module regulating the catalytic activity of SHIP2 in response to specific phosphoinositide levels in the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W3184377857,"In many developing countries, the deficiency in public and private investment has resulted in lower growth rates and stagnation in productivity. The need for a new paradigm of foreign investment and aid in agricultural production is becoming exigent in developing countries. Given the decline in per capita arable land, the rise in production costs, and the increase in population and urbanization, major changes in agriculture have been proposed to boost agricultural production. This present study endeavours to contribute to the existing literature by proving whether foreign capital and economic freedom could catapult food production into the much-anticipated growth. In that regard, we performed GLS with correlated disturbances, system GMM dynamic panel data estimators and D-H causality test. The study found that foreign capital as a whole plays a positive role in food production in developing and least developed countries, but FDI is insignificant in least-developed countries. Moreover, economic freedom plays a positive role in food production in least-developed countries but negative in developing countries. Policymakers and governments should create an enabling environment for sustainable food production."

Specifically, 6-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2H-benzo[e][1,3]oxazine-2,4(3H)-dione (Cf-02) (a) reduced serum levels of IgG anti-dsDNA, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, (b) inhibited activation of dendritic cells and differentially regulated T cell functions, and (c) suppressed the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome axis, targeting priming and activating signals of the inflammasome. Moreover, treatment with Cf-02 significantly inhibited secretion of IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, but this effect was abolished by autophagy induction. These results recommend Cf-02 as a promising drug candidate for the serious renal conditions associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Future investigations should examine whether Cf-02 may also be therapeutic in other types of chronic kidney disease involving NLRP3 inflammasome-driven signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3111809048,"This study used converging methods to examine the neural substrates of cognitive ability in middle-aged and older men with well-controlled HIV infection.Seventy-six HIV+ men on antiretroviral treatment completed an auditory oddball task and an inhibitory control (Simon) task while time-locked high-density EEG was acquired; 66 had usable EEG data from one or both tasks; structural MRI was available for 43. We investigated relationships between task-evoked EEG responses, cognitive ability and immunocompromise. We also explored the structural correlates of these EEG markers in the sub-sample with complete EEG and MRI data (N = 27).EEG activity was associated with cognitive ability at later (P300) but not earlier stages of both tasks. Only the oddball task P300 was reliably associated with HIV severity (nadir CD4). Source localization confirmed that the tasks engaged partially distinct circuits. Thalamus volume correlated with oddball task P300 amplitude, while globus pallidus volume was related to the P300 in both tasks.This is the first study to use task-evoked EEG to identify neural correlates of individual differences in cognition in men living with well-controlled HIV infection, and to explore the structural basis of the EEG markers. We found that EEG responses evoked by the oddball task are more reliably related to cognitive performance than those evoked by the Simon task. We also provide preliminary evidence for a subcortical contribution to the effects of HIV infection severity on P300 amplitudes. These results suggest brain mechanisms and candidate biomarkers for individual differences in cognition in HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3184600246,"Laminitis is one of the most devastating diseases in equine medicine, and although several etiopathogenetic mechanisms have been proposed, few clear answers have been identified to date. Several lines of evidence point towards its underlying pathology as being metabolism-related. In the carbonyl stress pathway, sugars are converted to methylglyoxal (MG)-a highly reactive α-oxoaldehyde, mainly derived during glycolysis in eukaryotic cells from the triose phosphates: D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. One common hypothesis is that MG could be synthesized during the digestive process in horses, and excessive levels absorbed into peripheral blood could be delivered to the foot and lead to alterations in the hoof lamellar structure. In the present study, employing an ex vivo experimental design, different concentrations of MG were applied to hoof explants (HE), which were then incubated and maintained in a specific medium for 24 and 48 h. Macroscopic and histological analyses and a separation force test were performed at 24 and 48 h post-MG application. Gene expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -14 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 were also measured at each time point for all experimental conditions. High concentrations of MG induced macroscopic and histological changes mimicking laminitis. The separation force test revealed that hoof tissue samples incubated for 24 h in a high concentration of MG, or with lower doses but for a longer period (48 h), demonstrated significant weaknesses, and samples were easily separated. All results support that high levels of MG could induce irreversible damage in HEs, mimicking laminitis in an ex vivo model."
https://openalex.org/W3185382795,"Collective memory studies show that Americans remember their presidents in a predictable pattern, which can be described as a serial position curve with an additional spike for Abraham Lincoln. However, all prior studies have tested Americans' collective memory for the presidents by their names. How well do Americans know the faces of the presidents? In two experiments, we investigated presidential facial recognition and compared facial recognition to name recognition. In Experiment 1, an online sample judged whether each of the official portraits of the US presidents and similar portraits of nonpresidents depicted a US president. The facial recognition rate (around 60%) was lower than the name recognition rate in past research (88%), but the overall pattern still fit a serial position curve. Some nonpresidents, such as Alexander Hamilton, were still falsely identified as presidents at high rates. In Experiment 2, a college sample completed a recognition task composed of both faces and names to directly compare the recognition rates. As predicted, subjects recognized the names of the presidents more frequently than the faces. Some presidents were frequently identified by their names but not by their faces (e.g. John Quincy Adams), while others were the opposite (e.g. Calvin Coolidge). Together, our studies show that Americans' memory for the faces of the presidents is somewhat worse than their memory for the names of the presidents but still follows the same pattern, indicating that collective memories contain more than just verbal information."

Methods Screening logs from the Adjunctive Glucocorticoid Therapy in Septic Shock Trial (ADRENAL) and site-level data from the College of Intensive Care Medicine and Australia New Zealand Intensive Care Society were examined. The effects of ICU characteristics such as tertiary academic status, research coordinator availability, number of admissions, and ICU affiliations on clinicians declining to randomize eligible patients were calculated using mixed effects logistic regression modelling. Results There were 21,818 patients screened for inclusion in the ADRENAL trial at 69 sites across five countries, out of which 5,501 were eligible, 3,800 were randomized and 659 eligible patients were declined for randomization by the treating clinician. The proportion of eligible patients declined by clinicians at individual ICUs ranged from 0 to41%. In the multivariable model, none of the ICU characteristics were significantly associated with higher clinician decline rate. Conclusions Neither tertiary academic status, nor other site-level variables were significantly associated with increased rate of clinicians declining eligible patients."

Nevertheless, no methods exist to to collectively evaluate this vast source of supply chain information.To aid in the extraction, evaluation and visualization of the data in RASFF notifications, we present the Rapid Alert Supply Network Extractor (RASNEX) open-source tool available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4322555 freely. Among RASNEX's functions is the graphical mapping of food and feed supply chain operators implicated in contamination events. RASNEX can be used during ongoing events as a support tool for risk analysis using RASFF notifications as input.In a first use case, we showcase the functionality of RASNEX with the RASFF notification on a 2017/2018 contamination event in eggs caused by the illegal use of fipronil. The information in this RASFF notification is used to visualize nine different flows of main and related food products. In a second use case, we combine RASFF notifications from different types of food safety hazards (Salmonella spp., fipronil and others) to obtain wider coverage of the visualized egg supply network compared to the first use case. Actors in the egg supply chain were identified mainly for Italy, Poland and Benelux. Other countries (although involved in the egg supply chain) were underrepresented.We hypothesize that biases may be caused by inconsistent RASFF reporting behaviors by its members. These inconsistencies may be counteracted by implementing standardized decision-making tools to harmonize decisions whether to launch a RASFF notification, in turn resulting in a more uniform future coverage across European food and feed supply chains with RASNEX."

https://openalex.org/W3185443542,"Building capacity for developing skills as leadership, teamwork, and continuous academic support has become essential for fulfilling a successful pharmacy career. This study aims to assess Jordanian pharmacists' views on professional development, namely: the continuous education infrastructure, strategies and programs for personal development, leadership skills, incentive schemes, drug information resources and digital services. As well as exploring options for better academic support delivered to pharmacists. To capture participant's views, an online validated and reliable survey was developed. Non-probability sampling design was used. Participants were qualified pharmacists working at Royal Medical Services (RMS) and Community Pharmacists (CP). Comparison and descriptive statistics were used to report the results. A total of 271 pharmacists participated, 144 from RMS (8% more than the needed sample) and 127 CP (7% more than the needed sample). There was a strong desire amongst both RMS and PC groups for continuous educational training particularly in the following areas, first: Advanced counselling and communication skills (means = 8.99±0.145, CI 95% = 3.70-4.28 and 9.37±0.096, CI 95% = 4.18-4.56). Second: Personal development skills (mean = 8.92±0.142, CI 95% = 3.64-4.20 and 9.02±0.145, CI 95% = 3.73-4.30). Third, Pharmaceutical health promotion (mean = 8.05±0.180, CI 95% = 2.70-3.41 and 8.57±0.159, CI 95% = 3.26-3.89). Only 19.4% and 18.1% of the RMS and CPs respectively reported the presence of a written policy for personal development and leadership in their workplace. There were few incentives for pharmacists to participate in research. Few pharmacists used the available drug information and toxicology centers. The professional and continuous personal development of pharmacists support an evolving healthcare system. This study emphasizes the need for a tailored and documented postgraduate educational strategy, personal development, and leadership skills training in Jordan. Implementing a well-defined scheme of incentives should be encouraged to engage pharmacists in continuous professional development programs and pharmaceutical research. Such strategy and training should enhance both professional and personal performance."
