Using a robotic tester, they show that this device can repeatably detect the pressure involved in gripping an object. They also show that the sensors can be attached to human fingers and that this does not affect the force used to grasp an object. Science , this issue p. 966 ; see also p. 910"

Achieving this in an artificial skin-like material has been a challenge because most of the approaches for sensing touch are themselves temperature sensitive. You et al. studied the ion relaxation dynamics in a conductive elastomeric film (see the Perspective by Liu). They show that the ion relaxation time can be used as a strain-insensitive intrinsic variable for detecting temperature and the capacitance can be used as a temperature-insensitive extrinsic variable for sensing the strain, thus decoupling the two so that their signals do not interfere with each other.

Here this “proteogenomics” approach was applied to 122 treatment-naive primary breast cancers accrued to preserve post-translational modifications, including protein phosphorylation and acetylation. Proteogenomics challenged standard breast cancer diagnoses, provided detailed analysis of the ERBB2 amplicon, defined tumor subsets that could benefit from immune checkpoint therapy, and allowed more accurate assessment of Rb status for prediction of CDK4/6 inhibitor responsiveness. Phosphoproteomics profiles uncovered novel associations between tumor suppressor loss and targetable kinases. Acetylproteome analysis highlighted acetylation on key nuclear proteins involved in the DNA damage response and revealed cross-talk between cytoplasmic and mitochondrial acetylation and metabolism. Our results underscore the potential of proteogenomics for clinical investigation of breast cancer through more accurate annotation of targetable pathways and biological features of this remarkably heterogeneous malignancy."

The human body is colonized by trillions of microbial organisms collectively referred to as the commensal microbiota (Erturk-Hasdemir and Kasper, 2013Erturk-Hasdemir D. Kasper D.L.

With advances in culture-independent DNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, there has been a rapid increase in our knowledge of the diversity and dynamics of the microbiota over the past two decades (Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012Human Microbiome Project ConsortiumStructure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome.Nature. 2012; 486: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (6030) Google Scholar; Qin et al., 2010Qin J.

Current estimates suggest that there are roughly as many bacterial cells as human cells in the body, the vast majority of which reside in the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which is colonized by an estimated 1014 bacteria (Qin et al., 2010Qin J.

Despite these advances, relatively little is understood about the molecular mechanisms by which specific commensal microbes interact with their mammalian host. A growing body of research has revealed that commensal microbes are not just passive residents, but they play an important role in modulating vital host physiological systems, both locally and systemically (Lin et al., 2014Lin C.S. Chang C.J. Lu C.C. Martel J. Ojcius D.M. Ko Y.F. Young J.D. Lai H.C. Impact of the gut microbiota, prebiotics, and probiotics on human health and disease.Biomed.

Invest. 2014; 124: 4197-4203PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding how microbes interact with their host is therefore not only biologically interesting, but it provides a platform for discovering potential therapeutic targets for a variety of human diseases. One mechanism by which microbes can modulate the host immune system is through regulation of cytokine signaling. Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are a family of structurally similar cytokines, consisting primarily of two different classes of proteins, interferon-α (IFN-α) and interferon-β (IFN-β), all of which signal through the common type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) (Theofilopoulos et al., 2005Theofilopoulos A.N. Baccala R. Beutler B. Kono D.H. Type I interferons (alpha/beta) in immunity and autoimmunity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 307-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). IFN-I expression is regulated at the transcriptional level and can be induced at high levels in all nucleated cells in response to sensing of pathogens by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014Ivashkiv L.B. Donlin L.T. Regulation of type I interferon responses.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Indeed, IFN-Is play a critical role in the response to the majority of virus infections through induction of a restrictive anti-viral state in cells, induction of apoptosis in infected cells, and regulation of immune cell subsets crucial to the antiviral response (McNab et al., 2015McNab F.

Immunol. 2012; 13: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have demonstrated that IFN-Is are not just present during infection, but are expressed constitutively at low levels and possess vital homeostatic functions (Gough et al., 2012Gough D.J. Messina N.L. Clarke C.J. Johnstone R.W. Levy D.E.

Indeed, IFN-Is have the capacity to regulate the development or function of virtually every immune effector cell, contributing to the anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor responses (Gough et al., 2012Gough D.J. Messina N.L. Clarke C.J. Johnstone R.W. Levy D.E. Constitutive type I interferon modulates homeostatic balance through tonic signaling.Immunity. 2012; 36: 166-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Despite this importance, the mechanism by which IFN-Is are induced and regulated in the absence of infection has yet to be elucidated. Due to the importance of IFN-Is to the health of the organism, it is of critical importance to gain a mechanistic understanding of how the constitutive IFN-I response is regulated in healthy individuals and might be disrupted leading to disease. We hypothesized that the commensal microbiota supplies PRR signaling to regulate the IFN-I response in the absence of infection. In this study, we discovered that the commensal microbiota regulates the IFN-I response both locally and systemically through induction of IFN-β by colonic lamina propria (LP) dendritic cells (DCs), enhancing resistance to virus infection. Moreover, the molecular mechanism by which a specific commensal microbe induces IFN-β was identified. Indeed, we found that outer membrane-associated glycolipids of human gut commensal microbes belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum induce expression of IFN-β. Using Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) as the paradigm, we determined that signaling to initiate IFN-β expression was through the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF) pathway. To investigate the role of the commensal microbiota in the host IFN-I response, the effect of microbiota depletion on downstream interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression in various murine tissues was analyzed. The vast majority of commensal microbes reside in the GI tract (Savage, 1977Savage D.C. Microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1977; 31: 107-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar; Turnbaugh et al., 2007Turnbaugh P.J. Ley R.E. Hamady M. Fraser-Liggett C.M. Knight R. Gordon J.I. The human microbiome project.Nature. 2007; 449: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar). Analysis was therefore performed to determine effects of the microbiota on ISG expression in the intestinal immune compartment, in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN), and systemically, in the spleen. Age- and gender-matched wild-type (WT) specific pathogen free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice were administered either vehicle control or a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) in the drinking water for 7 days to deplete the microbiota. The relative expression levels of a panel of ISGs were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A reduction in ISG expression was observed in both the mLN and spleen of WT ABX mice compared to WT SPF mice (Figures 1A–1D; Tables S1 and S2), demonstrating a role for microbiota regulation of the IFN-I response both locally and systemically. Due to the potential for off-target effects of antibiotics, a second method of microbiota depletion was used to confirm a direct role of the commensal microbiota on the observed phenotype (Morgun et al., 2015Morgun A. Dzutsev A. Dong X. Greer R.L. Sexton D.J. Ravel J. Schuster M. Hsiao W. Matzinger P. Shulzhenko N. Uncovering effects of antibiotics on the host and microbiota using transkingdom gene networks.Gut. 2015; 64: 1732-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Splenic and mLN ISG expression was analyzed in WT C57BL/6 germ-free (GF) mice devoid of all microbes compared to WT C57BL/6 SPF mice. Consistent with the ABX mice, a reduction in mLN and splenic ISG expression was observed (Figures S1A and S1B; Tables S1 and S2). Of the mammalian IFN-Is, IFN-β is unique with respect to its homeostatic functions and expression pattern (Schreiber and Piehler, 2015Schreiber G. Piehler J. The molecular basis for functional plasticity in type I interferon signaling.Trends Immunol. 2015; 36: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It was therefore hypothesized that the commensal microbiota induces the constitutive IFN-I response, as evidenced by ISG expression, specifically through regulation of IFN-β. ISG expression levels were compared by qRT-PCR between WT and IFN-β-deficient (Ifnb1−/−) SPF mice. A significant reduction in ISG expression was observed in the mLN and spleen of Ifnb1−/− mice compared to WT mice (Figures 1A–1D; Tables S1 and S2), confirming a role for IFN-β in the homeostatic IFN-I response. Interestingly, the magnitude of reduction was comparable to that observed upon microbiota depletion, with no significant difference between WT ABX and Ifnb1−/− SPF expression levels. To further test whether commensal-induced IFN-β is required for ISG expression, the microbiota of Ifnb1−/− mice was depleted by ABX administration. ABX treatment had no additional effect on mLN or splenic ISG expression in Ifnb1−/− mice (Figures 1A–1D; Tables S1 and S2), demonstrating that commensal microbes regulate the IFN-I response specifically through IFN-β. To investigate the source of commensal-induced IFN-β under homeostatic conditions, flow cytometric analysis was performed on tissues harvested from IFN-β-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter mice, in which cells activated to express IFN-β express YFP (Scheu et al., 2008Scheu S. Dresing P. Locksley R.M. Visualization of IFNbeta production by plasmacytoid versus conventional dendritic cells under specific stimulation conditions in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 20416-20421Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By analyzing IFN-β-YFP expression in the colon LP, mLN, and spleen, IFN-β expression was found to be localized to the intestinal milieu, with significantly higher percentages of IFN-β-YFP+CD45+ leukocytes in the colon LP compared to the spleen or mLN (Figures 2A and S2). The colon was chosen as a representative region of the GI tract because it is home to the greatest percentage of commensal organisms, both in terms of number and abundance (Turnbaugh et al., 2007Turnbaugh P.J. Ley R.E. Hamady M. Fraser-Liggett C.M. Knight R. Gordon J.I. The human microbiome project.Nature. 2007; 449: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar). Having identified the location of IFN-β expression, the cellular source of this cytokine was next investigated. Due to their role as sentinel cells in the immune system, DCs were hypothesized to be the main source of IFN-β under homeostatic conditions. It was found that out of the IFN-β-YFP+CD45+ cells in the colonic LP, the majority (∼74%) expressed CD11c, a molecule expressed on the surface of DCs and commonly used as a DC marker (Figure 2B) (Singh-Jasuja et al., 2013Singh-Jasuja H. Thiolat A. Ribon M. Boissier M.C. Bessis N. Rammensee H.G. Decker P. The mouse dendritic cell marker CD11c is down-regulated upon cell activation through Toll-like receptor triggering.Immunobiology. 2013; 218: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that colon LP DCs are a major source of IFN-β under homeostatic conditions.Figure S2Dendritic Cell IFN-β-YFP Representative Flow Cytometric Data, Related to Figure 2Show full captionSingle cell suspensions were prepared from the colon LP of SPF IFNβ-YFP reporter mice and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Representative dot plots and gating strategy to characterize IFNβ-YFP+ cells. As in other tissues, conventional DCs (cDCs) in the colon LP represent a heterogeneous population that can be classified into two subsets based on surface marker expression. cDC1 cells are CD103+CD11b−, whereas cDC2 cells comprise both CD103−CD11b+ and CD103+CD11b+ cells (Stagg, 2018Stagg A.J. Intestinal Dendritic Cells in Health and Gut Inflammation.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine which DCs express IFN-β, expression of CD103 and CD11b by the IFN-β-YFP+CD11c+CD45+ colonic dendritic cells was analyzed using flow cytometry. IFN-β expression was specific to the cDC2 subset of cells, including both CD103+CD11b+ and CD103−CD11b+ cells (Figure 2C). To confirm these findings, a second experimental approach was used in which DCs were isolated from the colon LP, mLN, and spleens of WT SPF mice using a magnetic bead-based cell separation method. Expression of Ifnb1 was analyzed in the whole tissue single-cell suspension as well as both the DC+ and DC− fractions of these tissues by qRT-PCR. There was no detectable Ifnb1 expression in the whole tissue or the DC− fraction of the majority of colon LP samples (Figure 2D) or in the mLN (Figure S3A) and spleen (Figure S3B). However, DCs in both the colon LP (Figures 2D and 2E) and the mLN (Figures 2E and S3A), but not the spleen (Figures 2F and S3B), expressed Ifnb1. Interestingly, DC expression of Ifnb1 is significantly higher in the colon LP than in the mLN (Figure 2E). These findings confirm that IFN-β is predominantly expressed by colon LP DCs. To test the role of the microbiota in colonic DC IFN-β expression, two methods of microbiota depletion were employed. ABX were administered in the drinking water of IFN-β-YFP mice for 7 days, followed by flow cytometric analysis of colon LP cells. A significant reduction in the frequency of IFNβ-YFP+CD11c+ cells was observed in IFN-β-YFP mice after ABX treatment (Figure 2F). In addition, Ifnb1 transcript levels in colon LP DCs of WT GF mice were analyzed by qRT-PCR. A significant reduction in Ifnb1 expression in WT GF mice compared to WT SPF mice was observed (Figure 2G). These results confirm that the microbiota induces IFN-β expression by colon LP DCs Having identified effects of commensal-induced IFN-β on ISG expression both locally and systemically, we investigated IFN-β levels in systemic circulation, through measurement of serum IFN-β levels using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Consistent with reports that IFN-I expression is extremely low under homeostatic conditions, we were unable to detect IFN-β in the serum of WT SPF or ABX mice (Figure S3C). Of the trillions of commensal bacteria that inhabit the mammalian gut, one of the most prominent phyla represented is the Bacteroidetes, consisting of obligate anaerobic, Gram-negative rods. An estimated 25% of all colonic anaerobes belong to the genus Bacteroides within this phylum (Salyers, 1984Salyers A.A. Bacteroides of the human lower intestinal tract.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38: 293-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar; Wexler, 2007Wexler H.M. Bacteroides: the good, the bad, and the nitty-gritty.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2007; 20: 593-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Recently an association was reported between several species of the genus Bacteroides, pDC numbers, and an IFN-I response gene signature (Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2017Geva-Zatorsky N. Sefik E. Kua L.

One of the Bacteroides sp. investigated in this study was B. fragilis, a common human colonic commensal bacterial species with previously demonstrated immunomodulatory properties (An et al., 2014An D.

Round J.L. Kasper D.L. A microbial symbiosis factor prevents intestinal inflammatory disease.Nature. 2008; 453: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). Due to its demonstrated ability to influence the immune system, as well as the association with pDCs and IFN-I, we hypothesized that B. fragilis regulates colonic DC IFN-β expression and thus regulates the IFN-I response. GF mice were colonized with B. fragilis strain NCTC 9343 at 4 weeks of age, followed by isolation of colon LP DCs after 2 weeks and analysis of Ifnb1 expression. As a colonization control, GF mice were colonized with a different bacterial species with demonstrated immunomodulatory properties, Clostridium ramosum (C. ramosum), thus controlling for any non-specific effects due to bacterial colonization (Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2017Geva-Zatorsky N. Sefik E. Kua L. Pasman L. Tan T.G. Ortiz-Lopez A. Yanortsang T.B. Yang L. Jupp R.

Individual intestinal symbionts induce a distinct population of RORγ+ regulatory T cells.Science. 2015; 349: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Colonization with B. fragilis significantly enhanced Ifnb1 expression in colon LP DCs, whereas C. ramosum colonization had no effect (Figure 3A). Although B. fragilis predominantly colonizes the lower intestinal tract, it is possible that it might also regulate Ifnb1 expression in other parts of the intestine. We therefore also examined Ifnb1 expression by DCs isolated from the small intestine (SI) LP of B. fragilis monocolonized mice. In contrast to the colon, colonization with B. fragilis had no observable effect on SI LP DC Ifnb1 expression (Figure S4), demonstrating that regulation of DC IFN-β by this commensal organism is location specific.Figure S4Ifnb1 Expression by SI LP DCs of B. fragilis Monocolonized Mice, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) WT germ free mice were gavaged with vehicle (GF, N = 3) or colonized at 4 weeks of age with B. fragilis (N = 3).

The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria serves as the site of interaction between the bacterial cell and its environment and comprises several classes of potential immunomodulatory molecules (Kasper and Seiler, 1975Kasper D.L.

To test whether an OM component is responsible for IFN-β expression, an in vitro model was developed in which bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) isolated from WT mice were treated with OM complexes isolated from B. fragilis, followed by ELISA analysis of secreted IFN-β in the supernatants. B. fragilis OM complexes significantly induced IFN-β secretion by BMDCs (Figure 3B). Capsular polysaccharides can be attached to the OM through covalent linkage to lipid anchors, which are inserted into the OM lipid bilayer (Cress et al., 2014Cress B.F. Englaender J.A. He W.

To test whether PSA is an IFN-β-inducing component of the B. fragilis OM, BMDCs were treated with purified PSA and secretion of IFN-β in the supernatants was analyzed by ELISA. Indeed, PSA significantly induced IFN-β secretion by BMDCs (Figure 3C). To confirm the ability of PSA to induce a productive IFN-I response through IFN-β, expression of downstream ISGs was analyzed by qRT-PCR in BMDCS treated for 24 h with PSA or vehicle control. An increase in ISG expression was observed in WT BMDCs treated with PSA (Figure 3D). Expression levels of the surface-expressed ISG, bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), were determined by flow cytometric analysis of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and also found to be increased in PSA-treated compared to vehicle control WT BMDCs (Figure 3E). Surface BST2 levels after PSA treatment were significantly reduced in IFNAR1-deficient (Ifnar1−/−) and Ifnb1−/− BMDCs, confirming that signaling of IFN-β through IFNAR1 is necessary for the observed increase in levels of a representative ISG by PSA. Together, these data demonstrate that PSA induces secretion of IFN-β and downstream ISG expression in vitro by BMDCs. To confirm the relevance of these findings in vivo, Ifnb1 expression by colon LP DCs was analyzed in WT SPF mice administered 150 μg of PSA by oral gavage. A significant increase in Ifnb1 expression was observed 1.5 h after treatment (Figure 3F), suggesting that PSA is capable of signaling to colon LP DCs in vivo to induce Ifnb1 expression. PSA has been previously demonstrated to signal via TLR2/1 heterodimers and dectin-1 on DCs to induce secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 by CD4+ T cells (Dasgupta et al., 2014Dasgupta S.

Kim et al. combined x-ray lasers for rapid structure determination with infrared femtosecond pulses for rapid heating of amorphous ice layers formed at about 200 kelvin. The heating process created high-density liquid water at increased pressures. As the layer expanded and decompressed, low-density liquid domains appeared and grew on time scales between 20 nanoseconds and 3 microseconds, which was much faster than competing ice crystallization.

Zhang et al. used a metabolomic screen to zero in on microbial strains from the microbiome of a sea squirt that produces a high diversity of chemical structures. They then screened these molecules for inhibition of fungi (see the Perspective by Cowen). A polycyclic molecule dubbed turbinmicin possessed potent antifungal activity against the multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens Candida auris and Aspergillus fumigatus . Preliminary mechanism-of-action and mouse toxicity studies suggest that this molecule works though a fungus-specific pathway and is well tolerated at therapeutic doses.

https://openalex.org/W3099081564,"Disease outbreaks among wildlife have surged in recent decades alongside climate change, although it remains unclear how climate change alters disease dynamics across different geographic regions. We amassed a global, spatiotemporal dataset describing parasite prevalence across 7346 wildlife populations and 2021 host-parasite combinations, compiling local weather and climate records at each location. We found that hosts from cool and warm climates experienced increased disease risk at abnormally warm and cool temperatures, respectively, as predicted by the thermal mismatch hypothesis. This effect was greatest in ectothermic hosts and similar in terrestrial and freshwater systems. Projections based on climate change models indicate that ectothermic wildlife hosts from temperate and tropical zones may experience sharp increases and moderate reductions in disease risk, respectively, though the magnitude of these changes depends on parasite identity."

Research on SARS-CoV-2, as well as the closely related SARS-CoV-1 and MERS coronaviruses, is restricted to BSL-3 facilities. Such BSL-3 classification makes SARS-CoV-2 research inaccessible to the majority of functioning research laboratories in the United States; this becomes problematic when the collective scientific effort needs to be focused on such in the face of a pandemic.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread around the globe. As of late October 2020, the virus has been detected in 189 different countries and territories with more than 43 million confirmed cases and more than one million attributed fatalities (https://covid19.who.int). The virulence of coronaviruses has previously been observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks in the previous 2 decades; however, there still remains no FDA-approved treatment for any coronavirus. In order to develop therapeutics, the ability to study viruses must be accessible. Under current circumstances, the authentic live SARS-CoV-2 virus is restricted to BSL-3 containment facilities; while many of these facilities exist and have refocused their collective efforts on SARS-CoV-2 research, the greater scientific community could be vastly helpful in combating this pandemic if such research was BSL-2 compatible. For instance, BSL-2 models of other difficult-to-work-with BSL-3 and -4 pathogens such as SARS-CoV-1 (1Siu Y.L. Teoh K.T. Lo J. Chan C.M. Kien F. Escriou N. Tsao S.W. Nicholls J.M. Altmeyer R.

Thus, the development of BSL-2 compatible models and assays to study SARS-CoV-2 assembly, budding, and entry, as well as evaluate potential therapeutics, is imperative. In this work, we aimed to develop morphologically and functionally relevant BSL-2-compatible VLPs to model SARS-CoV-2 budding and entry. SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of 29.7 kilobases, which shares 79.6% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-1 (7Zhou P. Yang X. Wang X. Hu B. Zhang L. Zhang W. et al.A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.Nature. 2020; 579: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (12486) Google Scholar). Both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 utilize host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to stimulate cellular uptake of bound viral particles (7Zhou P. Yang X. Wang X. Hu B. Zhang L. Zhang W. et al.A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.Nature. 2020; 579: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (12486) Google Scholar). Trafficked through the endocytic system of the cells, SARS-CoV-2 is eventually released into the cytoplasm where it utilizes ten open reading frames (ORFs) to encode numerous nonstructural proteins and four structural proteins (8Fehr A.R. Perlman S. Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis.Coronaviruses Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1282: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As has been described for other coronaviruses, the four structural proteins are in ucleoprotein (N), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), and spike protein (S) and are presumed responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the enveloped SARS-CoV-2 virion (8Fehr A.R. Perlman S. Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis.Coronaviruses Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1282: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The M glycoprotein of coronaviruses drives the assembly and formation of progeny viral particles from the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediary complex (ERGIC) and is the most abundant viral structural protein in the virion (8Fehr A.R. Perlman S. Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis.Coronaviruses Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1282: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). M oligomerizes to create a protein lattice across ERGIC membranes and interacts laterally with S and E, the other two viral membrane proteins, which are integrated into the structural matrix at sites of budding (2Wang C. Zheng X. Gai W. Zhao Y. Wang H. Wang H. Feng N. Chi H. Qiu B. Li N. Wang T. Gao Y. Yang S. Xia X.

Perlman S. Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis.Coronaviruses Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1282: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The role of E in assembly and budding is enigmatic, though it has been shown to be crucial for proper assembly of SARS-CoV-1 viral particles and serves as a viroporin altering ion transport (2Wang C.

Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis.Coronaviruses Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1282: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). While dispensable for viral particle assembly and formation in SARS-CoV-1, the incorporation of S is required for progeny viral particles to successfully infect a host cell (1Siu Y.L. Teoh K.T. Lo J. Chan C.M. Kien F. Escriou N. Tsao S.W. Nicholls J.M. Altmeyer R. Peiris J.S. Bruzzone R. Nal B.

Virol. 2008; 82: 11318-11330Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The final structural protein, N, is responsible for coordinating the viral RNA genome to the structural matrix, which it does through interactions with the cytosolic C-terminal endodomain of M in an RNA-independent manner (2Wang C. Zheng X. Gai W. Zhao Y. Wang H. Wang H. Feng N. Chi H. Qiu B. Li N. Wang T. Gao Y. Yang S. Xia X.

Perlman S. Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis.Coronaviruses Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1282: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These interactions between the four structural proteins facilitate the proper assembly, genomic packaging, and budding of progeny coronavirus particles (8Fehr A.R. Perlman S. Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis.Coronaviruses Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1282: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After budding into the ERGIC lumen, progeny viral particles are released from the infected cell by exocytosis (8Fehr A.R. Perlman S. Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis.Coronaviruses Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1282: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). While these processes have yet to be fully examined specifically in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, they are likely to follow a similar scheme based upon homology. Previously, transient coexpression of the four SARS-CoV-1 structural proteins in mammalian cell culture has been shown to produce self-assembling VLPs, which can be collected, purified, and used to study the molecular biology of the virus (1Siu Y.L.

While these VLPs were both morphologically and functionally similar to authentic SARS-CoV-1, they do not contain the viral genome, are noninfectious, and thus can be used in a BSL-2 setting. Until now, SARS-CoV-2 VLPs have only been used to identify M as the driver of viral particle formation (12Xu R. Shi M. Li J. Song P. Li N. Corrigendum: construction of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles by mammalian expression system.Front. Bioeng.

Vaccine development against COVID-19 prior to pandemic outbreaks, using in vitro evolution and reverse genetics.Front. Immunol. 2020; 11: 2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar); they have yet to be functionalized to study SARS-CoV-2 entry or inhibitors. Instead, the few identified entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 have been evaluated using classical coronavirus assays such as S-mediated cell–cell fusion (14Xia S. Liu M. Wang C. Xu W. Lan Q. Feng S. Qi F. Bao L. Du L. Liu S. Qin C. Sen F. Shi Z. Zhu Y. Jiang S. et al.Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (previously 2019-nCoV) by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion.Cell Res. 2020; 30: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) or pseudotyped VSV vectors (15Riva L. Yuan S. Yin X. Martin-Sancho L. Matsunaga N. Pache L. Burgstaller-Muehlbacher S. De Jesus P.D. Teriete P. Hull M.V. Chang M.V. Chan J.F. Cao J. Poon V.K. Herbert K.M. et al.Discovery of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs through large-scale compound repurposing.Nature. 2020; 586: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). VLPs offer a reliable and realistic model of S-mediated fusion and viral entry events in a BSL-2 setting. Herein, we discuss methods for production, purification, validation, and utilization of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs. A previous study by Xu et al. (12Xu R. Shi M. Li J. Song P. Li N. Corrigendum: construction of SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles by mammalian expression system.Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 2020; 8: 862Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) showed that M was released into the media of HEK293T and Vero E6 cells at 48-h posttransfection independent of other viral structural proteins. We repeated this experiment, independently expressing M, N, E, or S in HEK293 cells and collecting VLPs at 72-h posttransfection. Cell lysates and VLP fractions were analyzed with western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Additionally, we examined independently transfected cells with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1). When analyzed with western blot, M was not detectable in the cell lysate or VLP fraction when expressed independently. The insoluble cellular fraction was evaluated as well, and when expressed alone, M was also undetectable in this fraction (Fig. 1B). This is contrary to the findings of Xu et al., where Flag-M was detectable in the cell lysate when expressed alone. This discrepancy may be explained by Xu et al.’s use of a Flag-tagged construct while we used an untagged construct and the anti-Flag antibody may have superior sensitivity. SARS-CoV-1 M is known to be N-terminally glycosylated and the C-terminal domain is known to be important for interactions with N, which is why we preferred to use the untagged version of M. When coexpressed with N or S, our untagged M was detectable in the cell lysate and VLP fraction (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2). This effect of N on M was confirmed with immunofluorescence (Fig. S3). When analyzed with SEM, M independently expressed did appear to induce small changes to membrane structure but overall was qualitatively insignificant compared with mock transfections (Fig. 2).Figure 2Scanning electron microscopy of viral structural protein transfected cells. HEK293 cells were seeded onto coverslips and transfected individually or in combination with M, N, E, and/or S. Cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde 72-h posttransfection and kept at 4 °C until fixed with osmium tetroxide. Samples were then gradually dehydrated with ethanol and completely dehydrated with a critical point dryer. Once dehydrated, samples were mounted onto aluminum pins with double-sided carbon tape, charged with silver paint, and sputter coated prior to imaging. Images range in magnification from 10,000× to 80,000×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When independently expressed, N was readily detectable in the cell lysate and a small band was detectable in the VLP fraction (Fig. 1A). Intriguingly, N was also found in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1B). When this VLP sample was analyzed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), this fraction was not found to contain VLPs, but had proteinaceous aggregates that resemble high-order N oligomers (Fig. S4, white arrow). It is possible that what is detected in the western blot was either secreted N protein or detached N-packed filopodia, which cosedimented with VLPs, as SEM analysis revealed that expression of N alone induces filopodia formation. Further, filopodia formation in N-transfected cells was observed with confocal microscopy (Fig. S5). These results are complimentary to a study that previously showed that filaments formed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells are filled with N protein (16Bouhaddou M. Memon D. Meyer B. Swaney D. Beltrao P. Krogan N. The global phosphorylation landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Cell. 2020; 182: 685-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). When independently expressed, E was not detectable in the cell lysate (Fig. 1A). Similar to M, E is enriched by N as it becomes detectable in the cell lysate when coexpressed (Fig. 1B, Supporting Information 1). Contradictory to Xu et al. and previous work studying other coronavirus VLPs (12Xu R. Shi M. Li J. Song P. Li N.

Maeda A. Makino S. Release of coronavirus E protein in membrane vesicles from virus-infected cells and E protein-expressing cells.Virology. 1999; 263: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), when E was independently expressed, it was not detectable in the VLP fraction by western blot (Fig. 1A). Further, TEM analysis of the VLP fraction revealed a proteinaceous background comparable with that of the mock transfected VLP collection. (Fig. S4). SEM analysis of E-transfected cells revealed little to no change in the plasma membrane structure when compared with mock transfected cells (Fig. 2). When independently expressed, S was readily detectable in the cell lysate but not detectable in the VLP fraction (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, SEM analysis of S-transfected cells revealed stiff, rigid protrusions from the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). S trafficking to the plasma membrane was confirmed by confocal microscopy using S-GFP (Fig. S6). Since none of the viral structural proteins alone could sufficiently support VLP formation, we cotransfected combinations of structural proteins with M, as M is thought to be the major driver of particle assembly in coronaviruses (1Siu Y.L.

First, combinations of M + N (Fig. 1B), M + E (Fig. S2), and M + S (Fig. S2) were cotransfected and VLPs collected 72-h posttransfection. While M remained undetectable in the cell lysate and VLP fraction when expressed alone, when coexpressed with N or S, M was detectable in the cell lysate and VLP fraction. Notably, M + E did not release a detectable level of M. All three of these combinations were also examined with SEM (Fig. S1). M + E did not produce major changes in plasma membrane structure; however, M + N and M + S did. In M + N transfected cells, long filamentous filipodia were observed while in M + S transfected cells, stiff, rigid filaments were observed. We further explored the triple combination M + N + E (Fig. 1B), which produced a detectable level of VLPs. The addition of E to the M + N system enriched VLP production, indicating an important role of E in assembly and release. SEM analysis of M + N + E transfected cells revealed visible changes in membrane structure and VLPs at the cell surface. TEM analysis of the M + N + E VLP fraction revealed bald, spherical VLPs, which were not observed in the mock sample (Fig. 1C). When all four structural proteins were expressed and analyzed with TEM, spherical particles of approximately 100 nm in size were observed with a pronounced crown or “corona” (Fig. 1C). M + N + E + S transfected cells were also analyzed by SEM and revealed numerous VLPs at the cell surface, specifically at the base of filopodia. This is in agreement with SEM data examining release of SARS-CoV-1 viral particles (19Ng M. Lee J. Leong M. Ling A. Tan H. Ooi E. Topographic changes in SARS coronavirus–infected cells at late stages of infection.Emerging Infect. Dis. 2004; 10: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and recent SEM on SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (16Bouhaddou M. Memon D. Meyer B. Swaney D. Beltrao P. Krogan N. The global phosphorylation landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Cell. 2020; 182: 685-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). When analyzed with western blot, the M + N + E + S condition released the most VLPs (Fig. 1B). These findings are again contradictory to those of Xu et al. where S seemed to limit M release; however, in their study, all four structural proteins harbored a tag in contrast to our system. In the VLP fraction, S appeared as two bands; the second band represents a population of S cleaved by host furin proteases during egress. To model VLP assembly and budding, we utilized a recent electron microscopy technology, ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2) tagging, by exploiting S protein’s tolerance of a C-terminal tag to produce S-APEX2. Unlike other exogenous peroxidases, APEX2 remains active in the cytosol after TEM processing. APEX2 works by catalyzing 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) oxidation, which produces a dark brown precipitate visible with TEM (20Martell J.D. Deerinck T.J. Sancak Y. Poulos T.L. Mootha V.K. Sosinsky G.E. Ellisman M.H. Ting A. Engineered ascorbate peroxidase as a genetically encoded reporter for electron microscopy.Nat. Biotech. 2012; 30: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). For in situ detection of VLPs, we coexpressed S-APEX2 with the other viral structural proteins M, N, and E. Thirty hours posttransfection, cells were fixed and processed for APEX2 TEM. Cells exhibited localized staining of various endomembrane system compartments that extended from the perinuclear region nearly to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A, inset). At higher magnifications, images revealed gross perturbations of the endomembrane system with the appearance of highly stained localized vacuolar clusters enmeshed within tubular components (Fig. 3A, white circles). The stained areas represent localization of the S-APEX2. VLPs were detected in some of the stained swollen vesicular-tubular structures that had the structural hallmark of the ERGIC (Fig. 3A, marked by red and yellow squares). Demarcated areas revealed heavily stained tubular and vesicular compartments (Fig. 3, B and E, white arrowheads) that contained spherical VLPs evident due to the presence of APEX2-tagged spike protein (Fig. 3, C–D, red arrowheads). The VLPs in these compartments are well within the expected size range of SARS-CoV-2 virions. Spike protein alone cannot form VLPs, indicating the proper coexpression of at least some of the other viral structural proteins. To produce fluorescently labeled VLPs, we coexpressed S-GFP with M, N, and E in HEK293 cells. S-GFP incorporation into VLPs (GFP-VLPs) collected 72-h posttransfection was confirmed with western blot analysis (Fig. S7). The S-GFP incorporated into VLPs was likely successfully processed by host furins (Fig. S7), suggesting these VLPs may be entry competent. To test the entry competency of GFP-VLPs, the GFP-VLP entry assay was performed (Fig. 4A, schematic). Target cells infected with GFP-VLPs had clear GFP signal present in punctate, intracellular structures while mock infected cells lacked detectable GFP signal (Fig. 4A). As an additional control, media collected and clarified from cells expressing S-GFP alone was collected and used to infect target cells (Fig. S8). Similar to mock infection conditions, media from S-GFP expressing cells failed to yield detectable GFP signal in infected target cells. To model viral entry using TEM, we utilized S-APEX2 incorporated VLPs. Using the same methodology from the GFP-VLP entry assay, an APEX2-VLP entry assay was performed. Infected target cells were fixed, processed, and imaged with TEM as previously described in assembly and budding (Fig. 4, B–F). Dark staining represents the APEX2 signal and thus the localization of the APEX-VLPs. They were clearly detected as clustered in large internalized vesicles at the periphery of the cell. Coronaviruses in general are understood to utilize the host endocytic pathway to gain entry into target cells (8Fehr A.R. Perlman S. Coronaviruses: an overview of their replication and pathogenesis.Coronaviruses Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1282: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recently, SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were shown to colocalize with endocytic markers early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) and lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) after a 90-min incubation with target cells (21Liu J. Cao R. Xu M. Wang X. Zhang H. Hu H. Li Y. Hu Z. Zhong W. Wang M. Hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.Cell Discov. 2020; 6: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Viral particles were more frequently colocalized with LAMP1+ vesicles than EEA1+ vesicles, indicating that at 90-min postinfection, most particles are already trafficked deep into the endocytic pathway.

The hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system (HNS), comprising hypothalamic magnocellular neuroendocrine cells (MNCs) and their axonal projections to the posterior pituitary (PPi), is a key gateway for the brain to regulate peripheral function. Primarily residing in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON), MNCs release oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) from their neurohypophysial terminals into the peripheral bloodstream to regulate reproduction and fluid homeostasis (Harris, 1955bHarris G.W.

Despite the pivotal importance of the HNS in neuroendocrine regulation, knowledge on the structure of the HNS is mainly from histological tract tracing studies conducted decades ago (Buijs et al., 1978Buijs R.M.

The deep location of the pituitary and the presence of the fragile neural stalk leave the system frequently overlooked in recent brain-wide connectome studies (Dong, 2008Dong H.W.

To date, the full composition and wiring of the HNS remain incompletely understood. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that central OXT and AVP are involved in the regulation of various social and stress-related behaviors in the brain (Grinevich and Stoop, 2018Grinevich V. Stoop R.

Other than the PPi-projecting magnocellular OXT (Magno-OXT) neurons (20- to 35-μm soma diameter), the PVN also contains centrally projecting parvocellular OXT (Parvo-OXT) neurons (10- to 15-μm soma diameter), which were thought to be responsible for the central actions of OXT (Badoer, 1996Badoer E.

Darvishzadeh A. Huang K.W. Malenka R.C. Social reward requires coordinated activity of nucleus accumbens oxytocin and serotonin.Nature. 2013; 501: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Somatodendritic release from Magno-OXT neurons was thought to be the main source of OXT in the brain and was involved in central effects of OXT such as social recognition and maternal behavior (Bergquist and Ludwig, 2008Bergquist F.

Given the limited diffusion of locally released peptides to a distant region (Chini et al., 2017Chini B. Verhage M. Grinevich V.

Sci. 2017; 38: 982-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is less likely that the central actions of OXT observed in multiple extrahypothalamic regions were effects of locally released OXT (Li et al., 2016Li K.

Using OXT promoter-driven adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) that specifically infect OXT neurons, recent studies found that OXT neurons extensively projected to more than 50 brain regions and that axonal release of OXT neurons contributed to OXT-mediated fear attenuation (Knobloch et al., 2012Knobloch H.S. Charlet A. Hoffmann L.C. Eliava M. Khrulev S. Cetin A.H. Osten P. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Stoop R. Grinevich V.

Biol. 2018; 28: 1066-1078.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In these studies, however, viruses were injected into the hypothalamus and thus could infect both Magno-OXT and Parvo-OXT neurons (Knobloch et al., 2012Knobloch H.S. Charlet A. Hoffmann L.C. Eliava M. Khrulev S. Cetin A.H. Osten P. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Stoop R. Grinevich V. Evoked axonal oxytocin release in the central amygdala attenuates fear response.Neuron. 2012; 73: 553-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). As such, the processes and/or fibers observed within the brain may not necessarily represent projections of Magno-OXT neurons. Instead, different subsets of OXT neurons may independently project to different targets, confounding the origins of OXT in the brain. Mapping the connectivity of MNCs, particularly Magno-OXT neurons in the HNS, is therefore crucial to address these concerns. As all MNCs project to the PPi (neurohypophysis), we reasoned that retrograde tracing from the PPi would be an appropriate way to selectively label MNCs. Together with newly engineered viral tracers, we may be able to fully delineate the morphology and projections of MNCs. By injecting the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged retrogradely transported virus (AAV-Retro-GFP; hereinafter Retro-GFP) into PPi (Tervo et al., 2016Tervo D.G. Hwang B.Y. Viswanathan S. Gaj T. Lavzin M. Ritola K.D. Lindo S. Michael S. Kuleshova E. Ojala D. et al.A designer AAV variant permits efficient retrograde access to projection neurons.Neuron. 2016; 92: 372-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), we selectively labeled the MNC ensemble and reconstructed the three-dimensional (3D) connection map of the rat HNS. We further traced their fiber trajectories at single-cell resolution and uncovered multiple extrahypothalamic collateral projections of MNCs. By dual retro-tracing strategy, we confirmed that subsets of MNCs collaterally projected to the PPi and different brain regions. Using customized OXT-Cre rats, we revealed that Magno-OXT neurons collaterally project to multiple brain areas, including the previously unidentified caudate putamen (CPu). Chemogenetic activation of Magno-OXT neurons not only elevated peripheral OXT release but also drove central OXT-dependent social interactions and locomotion. Conversely, chemogenetic inhibition of Magno-OXT neurons suppressed both peripheral OXT release and social investigation. This study uncovers the full organization of the HNS and provides direct evidence for Magno-OXT neurons in coordinating both central and peripheral actions of OXT. To selectively label the MNCs projecting to the neurohypophysis, we injected the retrogradely transported virus AAV-Retro-EGFP (1 μl, 1.28 ⋅ E+13 vg/ml) into the PPi of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats after optimizing viral dosage (Figures 1A [left panel] and S1A). Two weeks later, intense GFP epifluorescence was observed in the PPi, demonstrating the accuracy of viral injection and infection (Figure 1A, middle panel). Robust GFP signals within the neural stalk reflected the effective retrograde transport of the virus along the axons (Figure 1A, right panel). GFP+ cells were primarily located from the preoptic to the tuberal areas of the hypothalamus and packed into multiple discrete nuclei, ranging from 0 mm to −3 mm along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis and from −6 mm to −10.5 mm along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis (Figure 1C) in both male and female rats. Abundant GFP+ cells were distributed in the expected principal magnocellular neurosecretory nucleus (PMN), SON, and PVN (Figure 1B). Moreover, densely packed GFP+ cells were seen in the less defined accessory magnocellular neurosecretory nucleus (AMN) (Fisher et al., 1979Fisher A.W. Price P.G. Burford G.D. Lederis K. A 3-dimensional reconstruction of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system of the rat.

Neurol. 1981; 198: 45-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), consisting of the anterior commissural nucleus (ACN), the nucleus circularis (CiN), the anterior perifornical nucleus (AF), the posterior perifornical nucleus (PoF), the nucleus of the medial forebrain bundle (Nmfb), and the retrochiasmatic nucleus (RCN) (Figures S1B and S1C). Notably, scattered GFP+ cells were also seen in the lateral and preoptic hypothalamic areas, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), medial preoptic area (MPO), and lateral preoptic area (LPO) (Figure S1C), as well as the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and preoptic periventricular nucleus (PVpo) (Figure S1C; data not shown). These areas are hereinafter referred to as the scattered magnocellular neurosecretory system (SMN). Thus, the engineered retrograde viral tracers allowed us to efficiently label the cell ensemble that directly innervates the neurohypophysis from multiple nuclei of the hypothalamus (schematically illustrated in Figures 1C and S1D). MNCs release hormones directly into the bloodstream via their axonal terminals in the neurohypophysis devoid of the BBB. To assess the neuroendocrine property of the virally traced GFP+ cells, we intraperitoneally injected the rats (PPi-viral injected) with Fluoro-Gold (FG), a fluorescent dye that can be taken up by nerve terminals outside the BBB and retrogradely transported to the somas (Figure 1D). Prominent FG-labeled neurons were observed in the SON, PVN, and arcuate nucleus (ARC) that are known to be neurosecretory (Figure S1E; data not shown for ARC). Importantly, all the GFP+ cells in the SON, PVN, and AMN were co-labeled with FG (100% dual labeling). GFP+ cells scattered in the preoptic area (POA) and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) also exhibited a high percentage (89% and 95%, respectively) of FG dual labeling (Figure 1E), suggesting that retrograde tracing from the PPi faithfully labeled the MNCs innervating the PPi. Given the limited efficiency of viral infection and retrograde transport, FG+ MNCs within the SON, PVN, and AMN were partly labeled by GFP. Approximately 61% of FG+ cells in SON were GFP positive (Figure S1F), which reflects the labeling efficiency of the retrograde viral tracer, as virtually all neurons in the rat SON project to the neurohypophysis (Swanson and Sawchenko, 1983Swanson L.W. Sawchenko P.E. Hypothalamic integration: organization of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1983; 6: 269-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). PVN contains both MNCs projecting to the PPi and parvocellular neuroendocrine cells (PNCs) projecting to the median eminence (ME) that is closely connected to the pituitary gland. To further examine whether PPi-retrograde tracing specifically labels MNCs but not PNCs in the PVN, we carried out GFP staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses using a well-accepted marker for PNCs, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). No co-localization was observed between GFP- and TRH-positive cells in the PVN, further verifying that PPi-retrograde tracing selectively labels MNCs rather than PNCs (Figure 1F). MNCs are known to contain AVP/OXT. To examine whether all traced MNCs contain AVP or OXT, we performed co-immunostaining of GFP with mixed antibodies to AVP and OXT (antibodies were both generated from rabbits). As expected, almost all GFP+ cells in the PMN and AMN were co-labeled with AVP and OXT (Figures 1G and S2A). By contrast, only 80% of GFP+ cells in the LHA expressed AVP or OXT, suggesting that not all cells projecting to the neurohypophysis contain AVP or OXT. Using OXT and AVP antibodies raised from different species, we were able to determine the fraction of OXT or AVP cells in different nuclei. Consistent with previous findings (Hou-Yu et al., 1986Hou-Yu A. Lamme A.T. Zimmerman E.A. Silverman A.-J.

Morphology of vasopressin and oxytocin neurones and their central and vascular projections.Prog. Brain Res. 1983; 60: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), we found that ACN contained only OXT neurons, whereas other nuclei contained both AVP and OXT with different percentages (Figures S2B–S2D). All the nuclei, except the Nmfb, contained more OXT neurons than AVP neurons (Figure 1H). Altogether, OXT+ and AVP+ cells accounted for 63% and 37% of retrogradely traced MNCs (Figure 1I). Given that retrograde viral tracer clearly labeled the MNC ensemble, we took a further step to construct the HNS. To acquire a full architecture of the HNS, the brains with intact neural stalks and pituitaries were carefully isolated from PPi retro-traced rats and imaged by fluorescent micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) at a resolution of 0.32 × 0.32 × 2 μm3 (schematically illustrated in Figure 2A and Video S1). All samples were scrutinized for GFP signals along the needle track to ensure that only accurately shot and infected samples were used for subsequent 3D reconstruction and analyses (Figures S3A–S3F). An individual dataset containing over 6,600 coronal slices from each brain was generated from qualified samples, and the raw data were registered to the rat brain atlas (Swanson, 2004Swanson L. Brain Maps: Structure of the Rat Brain. Gulf Professional Publishing, 2004Google Scholar). Since MNCs were localized between 0 and −3.4 mm along the AP axis, we axially stacked 1,700 re-sampled fMOST coronal images spanning this area to reconstruct the HNS using Imaris software (Figures 2B and 2C). The reconstructed projection gives a 3D overview of the HNS, with MNCs (5,868 cells per rat, on average) packed into more than 8 nuclei in the hypothalamus and axons bundled together to form the arc tracts of Greving (Greving, 1926Greving R. Beiträge zur anatomie der hypophyse und deren funktion. II.

The nervous regulation system of the posterior pituitary gland (the nucleus supraopticus and its fiber systems)].Z. Gesamte Neurol. Psychiatr. 1926; 104: 466-479Google Scholar), subsequently passing through the ME and terminating in the PPi (Figure 2B). Among the multiple nuclei, the SON, abutting the ventral surface of the brain (from 0 to −1.8 mm along the AP axis), contains the most abundant GFP+ cells (1,617 ± 198 cells). Caudal and medial to SON lies the RCN, whereas dorsal to the SON is the Nmfb. Notably, MNCs in the PVN and ACN are arranged in a butterfly-like shape, with the ACN constituting the forewings and the PVN forming the hindwings. The perifornical MNC aggregates, including both AF and PoF, lie dorsal-lateral to the fornix, whereas CiN lies midway between the PVN and SON (Figures 2B and 2C). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/490a3f50-759a-4778-8620-d15aa8c43db3/mmc4.mp4Loading ...

Armstrong W.E. Reorganization of the dendritic trees of oxytocin and vasopressin neurons of the rat supraoptic nucleus during lactation.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 841-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitatively, about half (53% ± 2.7%) of the GFP+ MNCs were located in the PMN, including SON and PVN, while one third (31% ± 2.3%) and 16% of labeled MNCs were found in the AMN and SMN, respectively (Figure 2D). A heatmap illustrating the number and distribution of GFP+ MNCs in different nuclei is presented on a sagittal plane of the rat brain (Figure 2E). High-resolution fMOST images allowed us to identify not only the somas but also the fine processes of MNCs (Figure 3A). Within the hypothalamus, the Greving tract of MNC axons was clearly seen (Figure 2B); outside the hypothalamus, GFP+ processes/fibers were also observed in multiple areas. Both the cortical regions, such as the piriform cortex (Piri C) and auditory cortex (Audi C), and the subcortical regions, including the amygdala (AMY), CPu, lateral septum (LS), and nucleus accumbens (NAc), contained GFP+ fibers (Figures 3B and S4C), with peak density of fibers found in the piriform cortex (Figures 3C and 3D). Of note, GFP+ fibers were undetectable in the reward center, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Figure 3B), in accordance with recent findings showing that Magno-OXT neurons do not project to the VTA in mice (Xiao et al., 2017Xiao L.

Biased oxytocinergic modulation of midbrain dopamine systems.Neuron. 2017; 95: 368-384.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All the GFP+ areas, except the AMY, are more than 1,000 μm away from the somal location of MNCs in the hypothalamus. As the viruses were injected into the PPi, fibers in the extrahypothalamic regions likely represent collaterals of the retrogradely traced MNCs in the brain. To fully delineate the morphology of MNCs, we traced fiber trajectories of GFP-labeled MNCs and reconstructed the cells at single-cell resolution using Amira software (Figures 3E and S4D–S4G; Video S2). All the 46 traced MNCs send axons winding through the anterior hypothalamic area/LHA (AHA/LHA), passing by the fornix and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), to the ME (Figure S4H). Other than ME projection, 7 cells (7/46; 15%) within the PVN and PoF showed bifurcated projections to the NAc, CPu, and lateral globus pallidus (LGP) (Figures 3E and S4I; Table S1; Video S3). Injection of the retrograde viral tracer expressing Cre recombinase (AAV-Retro-Cre) into the PPi and a Cre-dependent AAV expressing GFP and synaptophysin-conjugated mRuby into the PVN (Figures 3F and 3G) revealed prominent GFP signals and mRuby-positive inflated beaded axon terminals in both the shell and core region of the NAc (Figure 3H), verifying the collateral projections to NAc from MNCs. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/38f4e849-3436-4485-9ba1-a0624da6a0c1/mmc5.mp4Loading ...

https://openalex.org/W3100695431,"Riding the calcium waves Rotavirus causes severe diarrhea and vomiting in children worldwide, yet how infection causes these diseases remains poorly understood. A leading theory is that virus-infected cells secrete paracrine signaling molecules that dysregulate epithelial cells. Chang-Graham et al. found that rotavirus-infected cells trigger cell-to-cell signaling that manifests as intercellular calcium waves (see the Perspective by Stanifer and Boulant). This signal results from the repeated release of adenosine 5′-diphosphate by rotavirus-infected cells. This release activates receptors on nearby uninfected cells, resulting in a calcium signal. The intercellular calcium waves activate chloride and serotonin secretion, which contributes to diarrhea and vomiting. Blocking this paracrine signal could represent a target for antidiarrheal pharmacotherapy. Science , this issue p. eabc3621 ; see also p. 909"

https://openalex.org/W3098780628,"Background Epidemiological studies during the early phase of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemics reported different level of people’s risk perception in different countries. There is a paucity of data on perceived high risk of COVID-19 and associated factors in Ethiopia. We sought to assess the prevalence of community’s perceived high risk about COVID-19 infections and associated factors among Gondar town community. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out from April 20 to 27, 2020 in Gondar town community, Northwest Ethiopia. Multistage cluster sampling technique was used to recruit 635 participants. Structured and pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression were used to summarize the results. Results A total of 623 participants were considered in the analysis with a response rate of 98.1%. The prevalence of coronavirus high risk perceptions of the respondents was found to be 23.11% (95% CI; 19.80%–26.43%). Age above 45 years (AOR = 1.41, 95%CI; 1.19–2.66), college and above educational level (AOR = 0.28, 95%CI; 0.21–0.98), and poor knowledge towards COVID-19 virus (AOR = 1.57, 95%CI; 1.09–2.23) were significantly associated with perceived high risk about COVID-19. Conclusions The prevalence of perceived high risk of COVID-19 was found to be low. Factors such as age, educational status, and knowledge about COVID-19 virus were found to be independent predictors of perceived high risk towards COVID-19. Government and non-government organizations should use formal and informal means of educating the community."
https://openalex.org/W3103074169,"Inclusion of game elements in learning environments to increase motivation and learning outcome is becoming increasingly popular. However, underlying mechanisms of game-based learning have not been studied sufficiently yet. In the present study, we investigated effects of game-based learning environments on a neurofunctional level. In particular, 59 healthy adults completed a game-based version (including game elements such as a narrative and virtual incentives) as well as a non-game-based version of a number line estimation task, to improve fractional knowledge, while their brain activity was monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy. Behavioral performance was comparable across the two versions, although there was a tendency that less errors were made in the game-based version. However, subjective user experience differed significantly between versions. Participants rated the game-based version as more attractive, novel, and stimulating but less efficient than the non-game-based version. Additionally, positive affect was reported to be higher while engaging in the game-based as compared to the non-game-based task version. Corroborating these user reports, we identified increased brain activation in areas associated with emotion and reward processing while playing the game-based version, which might be driven by rewarding elements of the game-based version. Moreover, frontal areas associated with attention were also more activated in the game-based version of the task. Hence, we observed converging evidence on a user experience and neurofunctional level indicating that the game-based version was more rewarding as well as emotionally and attentionally engaging. These results underscore the potential of game-based learning environments to promote more efficient learning by means of attention and reward up-tuning."

Developing high throughput diagnostics which does not involve handling of infectious material becomes imperative in the case of pandemics such as the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV2. Methods A protein microarray technology was used to detect the plurality of antibody response to four novel antigens namely S1 glycoprotein, Receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein of the novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV2 using serum samples. A DBS card was additionally used to compare its performance with a venipuncture-based serum separator tube (SST) draw. Results The three main subclasses of antibodies IgM, IgA and IgG were analyzed to see the variations in immune responses in the affected population and compared to their microbial RT-PCR based NP swab results. The clinical sensitivity and specificity were determined to be 99.67% and 99.77%. In the matrix comparison study, which would enable patients to test without risk of transmitting the virus, DBS (Dried Blood Spot) matched with higher than 98% accuracy to a venipuncture-based SST collection. Conclusion Multiplex testing enables higher sensitivity and specificity which is essential while establishing exposure on a population scale. This flexible platform along with a discrete collection methodology would be crucial and broadly useful to scale up testing in current and future pandemics. Minimum sample volume that can be collected using DBS cards can be processed in this multiplex pillar plate format enabling the capacity to provide the reliability of high throughput analyzers while having the ease of collection similar to rapid tests."
https://openalex.org/W3098533348,"We present a data-informed, highly personalized, probabilistic approach for the quantification of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk. Our novel framework builds upon a comprehensive database of tensile test results that were carried out on 305 AAA tissue samples from 139 patients, as well as corresponding non-invasively and clinically accessible patient-specific data. Based on this, a multivariate regression model is created to obtain a probabilistic description of personalized vessel wall properties associated with a prospective AAA patient. We formulate a probabilistic rupture risk index that consistently incorporates the available statistical information and generalizes existing approaches. For the efficient evaluation of this index, a flexible Kriging-based surrogate model with an active training process is proposed. In a case-control study, the methodology is applied on a total of 36 retrospective, diameter matched asymptomatic (group 1, n = 18) and known symptomatic/ruptured (group 2, n = 18) cohort of AAA patients. Finally, we show its efficacy to discriminate between the two groups and demonstrate competitive performance in comparison to existing deterministic and probabilistic biomechanical indices."
https://openalex.org/W3104714975,"Background Occult hepatitis B (OHB) is a major concern in HIV infected patients as it associates with a high risk of HBV reactivation and disease progression. However, data on the prevalence of OHB among HIV positive patients in Ethiopia is lacking. This study aims to determine the prevalence of OHB in HBV/HIV co-infected patients from Gondar, Ethiopia. Methods A total of 308 consented HIV positive patients were recruited from the University of Gondar Teaching Hospital, Ethiopia. Clinical and demographic data of the participants were recorded. Plasma was tested for HBsAg and anti-HBc using commercial assays (Abbott Architect). In HBsAg negative anti-HBc positive patient samples, total DNA was isolated and amplified using nested PCR with primers specific to HBV polymerase, surface and pre-core/core regions, followed by Sanger sequencing and HBV mutational analysis using MEGA 7.0. Results Of the total study subjects, 62.7% were female, median age 38.4 years, interquartile range (IQR): 18–68, and 208 (67.5%) had lifestyle risk factors for HBV acquisition. Two hundred and ninety-one study subjects were HIV+/HBsAg-, out of which 115 (39.5%) were positive for anti-HBc. Occult hepatitis B was detected in 19.1% (22/115) of anti-HBc positive HIV patients. HBV genotype D was the predominant genotype (81%) among OHB positive patients. Mutations associated with HBV drug resistance, HBV reactivation, and HCC risk were detected in 23% (5/22), 14% (3/22) and 45.5% (10/22) of patients, respectively. Conclusion This study found a high rate of occult hepatitis B in HIV patients. Further, high rates of mutations associated with HBV reactivation, drug resistance, and HCC risk were detected in these patients. These data highlighted the need for integrating OHB screening for proper management of liver diseases in HIV patients."
https://openalex.org/W3100803190,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been withdrawn from the market due to their toxicity, bioaccumulation capacity, and persistence. PCBs have been observed to potentially form in combustion processes under appropriate conditions and in the presence of precursors containing chlorine. The study covered a municipal waste incineration plant and an industrial waste incineration plant. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of these objects on PCB accumulation in soil and plants taking into account the distance from the emission object and wind direction. Soil samples were collected from layers: 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm. Test plants were collected from the same areas as the soil samples. The highest accumulation of PCBs was found in plants with large leaf area. Around the municipal waste incineration plant, these were Tanacetum vulgare leaves (12.45 ng/g), and around the industrial waste incineration plant–grasses (4.3 ng/g). In the case of soils, the accumulation of PCBs for both kind waste incinerators was similar, reaching approximately 3 ng/g. As the distance from the municipal waste incinerator and industrial waste incinerator increased, the accumulation of PCBs in the soil decreased. For municipal waste incinerator, no effect of wind direction on PCB accumulation in the soil was observed. In the majority of cases, the accumulation of PCBs in soils taken from the leeward side of the industrial waste incinerator was higher than that in soils from the windward side. In soils around the municipal waste incinerator, PCB compounds moved deep into the soil and reached the highest accumulation in the soil layer of 10-20 cm or 20-30 cm. In soils around the industrial waste incinerator, the highest accumulation of PCBs occurred in the soil layer of 0-5 cm."

Adults admitted to a tertiary care hospital for medical management of self-poisoning were included as cases, and age and sex matched controls were recruited from the outpatient department. ACE were measured using the World Health Organization's Childhood Adversity Scale. Logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and religion were used to quantify the association between ACE and self-poisoning.The study included 235 cases and 451 controls.

The composition and structure of endophytes vary in different plant tissues, which are specific habitats for endophyte colonization. To analyze the diversity and structural composition of endophytic fungi from toothed clubmoss ( Huperzia serrata ) that was artificially cultivated for 3 years, we investigated endophytic fungi from the roots, stems and leaves using comparative sequence analysis of the ITS2 region of the fungal rRNA genes sequenced with high-throughput sequencing technology. Seven fungal phyla were identified, and fungal diversity and structure varied across different tissues, with the most distinctive community features found in the roots. A total of 555 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected, and 198 were common to all samples, and 43, 16, 16 OTUs were unique to the root, stem, leaf samples, respectively. Taxonomic classification showed that Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were dominant phyla, and Cladosporium , Oidiodendron , Phyllosticta , Sebacina and Ilyonectria were dominant genera. The relative abundance heat map at the genus level suggested that H . serrata had characteristic endophytic fungal microbiomes. Line discriminant analysis effect size analysis and principal coordinate analysis demonstrated that fungal communities were tissue-type and tissue-site specific. Overall, our study provides new insights into the complex composition of endophytic fungi in H . serrata ."

The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between eating disorders and characteristics of the relationship with parents and the parental feeding practices in early adolescence. Methods 21 female adolescents and young adults with an eating disorder (ED)–bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa–and 22 females without eating disorder (healthy control; HC), aged between 16 and 26, were assessed via self-report questionnaires for problematic eating behaviour, relationship with parents, perceptions of parent’s feeding practices at the age of 10–13 years and personality. Statistical evaluation was performed by means of group comparisons, effect sizes, regression analyses and mediator analyses. Results Adolescent and young adult females with ED reported more fears/overprotection and rejection/neglect by their mothers and less self-responsibility in terms of eating behaviour during adolescence than did the HC. The relationship with the fathers did not differ significantly. Females who perceived more cohesion, rejection/neglect and fears/overprotection by the mother were more likely to suffer from an ED. Rejection/neglect by both parents were associated with less self-acceptance of the young females with even stronger effect sizes for the fathers than the mothers. Harm prevention in the young females was a partial mediator between fears/overprotection and the drive for thinness. Conclusions The parental relationship is partly reflected in the self-acceptance and self-responsibility in eating of the adolescent and young females, both of them are particularly affected in EDs. Stressors in the parent-child relationship should be targeted in treatment of eating disorders. Nutritional counselling for parents might be useful in early adolescence."

However, current studies of the regulation and function of SENP in zinc-deficient status during heart development remain limited. In this study, SUMO1 modification was found to gradually decrease during heart development, and the level of SENP5 exhibited a similar trend to SUMO1 conjugation. In addition, zinc deficiency resulted in cardiac dysplasia, increased cell apoptosis, decreased cell viability, and differentiation inhibition of hiPSC-CMs. In order to investigate the function of SENP5 in zinc deficiency, hiPSC-CMs were transfected with SENP5 small interfering RNA. The negative effects of zinc lacking conditions were reversed with depletion of SENP5. It was confirmed that zinc deficiency induced abnormal differentiation of hiPSCs and increased apoptosis of hiPSC-CMs by promoting SENP5 overexpression, which led to cardiac dysplasia. Thus, it was concluded that SENP5 regulates the SUMO1 deconjugation during heart development and zinc deficiency may reduce conjugated SUMO by promoting SENP5 overexpression, which induces abnormal development of the myocardium."

https://openalex.org/W3098519354,"Purpose This study aimed to develop a quantitative dry cupping system that can monitor negative pressure attenuation and soft tissue pull-up during cupping to quantify soft tissue compliance. Methods Baseball players with myofascial pain syndrome were recruited to validate the benefits of cupping therapy. Nine of 40 baseball players on the same team were diagnosed with trapezius myofascial pain syndrome; another nine players from the same team were recruited as controls. All participants received cupping with a negative pressure of 400 mmHg for 15 minutes each time, twice a week, for 4 weeks. Subjective perception was investigated using upper extremity function questionnaires, and soft tissue compliance was quantified objectively by the system. Results During the 15-minute cupping procedure, pressure attenuation in the normal group was significantly greater than that in the myofascial group ( p = 0.017). The soft tissue compliance in the normal group was significantly higher than that in the myofascial group ( p = 0.050). Moreover, a 4-week cupping intervention resulted in an obvious increase in soft tissue lift in the myofascial pain group ( p = 0.027), although there was no statistical difference in the improvement of soft tissue compliance. Shoulder ( p = 0.023) and upper extremity function ( p = 0.008) were significantly improved in both groups, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion This quantitative cupping monitoring system could immediately assess tissue compliance and facilitate the improvement of soft tissues after cupping therapy. Hence, it can be used in athletes to improve their functional recovery and maintain soft tissues health during the off-season period."
https://openalex.org/W3103476613,"This study aimed to determine the association between umbilical cord leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG) and fetal infection and investigate the underlying mechanism of LRG elevation in fetuses. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who delivered at Osaka University Hospital between 2012 and 2017 and selected those with histologically confirmed chorioamnionitis (CAM), which is a common pregnancy complication that may cause neonatal infection. The participants were divided into two groups: CAM with fetal infection (CAM-f[+] group, n = 14) and CAM without fetal infection (CAM-f[−] group, n = 31). Fetal infection was defined by the histological evidence of funisitis. We also selected 50 cases without clinical signs of CAM to serve as the control. LRG concentrations in sera obtained from the umbilical cord were unaffected by gestational age at delivery, neonatal birth weight, nor the presence of noninfectious obstetric complications (all, p &gt; 0.05). Meanwhile, the LRG levels (median, Interquartile range [IQR]) were significantly higher in the CAM-f(+) group (10.37 [5.21–13.7] μg/ml) than in the CAM-f(−) (3.61 [2.71–4.65] μg/ml) or control group (3.39 [2.81–3.93] μg/ml; p &lt; 0.01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of LRG for recognizing fetal infection was 0.92 (optimal cutoff, 5.08 μg/ml; sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 88%). In a mouse CAM model established by lipopolysaccharide administration, the fetal LRG protein in sera and LRG mRNA in the liver were significantly higher than those in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-administered control mice ( p &lt; 0.01). In vitro experiments using a fetal liver-derived cell line (WRL68) showed that the expression of LRG mRNA was significantly increased after interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α) stimulation ( p &lt; 0.01); the induction was considerably stronger following IL-6 and TNF-α stimulation ( p &lt; 0.01).

https://openalex.org/W3098557126,"Objective Despite the positive attitudes pharmacists have toward evidence-based practices (EBPs), its application in community pharmacies in Saudi Arabia is lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to explore and assess EBPs by community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia when they dispense over-the-counter (OTC) medications for three minor ailments: diarrhea, cough, and the common cold. Research design and methods We used a mixed-methods approach consisting of two study parts. The first was a quantitative investigation that used mystery shoppers. Four researchers, posing as mystery shoppers, visited 214 randomly selected pharmacies in the Riyadh region of Saudi Arabia. They used 14 questions from a standardized checklist to examine EBPs by community pharmacists. The qualitative part of the study entailed three focus-group discussions with 13 pharmacists from different community practice settings and explored factors that affected the application of EBPs when supplying OTC medications from the pharmacists’ point of view. Results The analysis indicated that 40% of pharmacists dispensed OTC medications according to EBPs. Logistic regression analysis showed that one question, ""Describe your symptoms"", predicted the correct supply of OTC medications (p = 0.021). The qualitative section of the study identified nine factors that affected EBP. Some of these factors facilitated EBP, such as established patient-pharmacist relationships, some acted as barriers such as conflicts between available evidence, while other factors could either facilitate or hinder EBPs, such as the health literacy of the patient. Conclusion Given that dispensing OTC medication is a core function of pharmacists, this study uncovered low adherence to EBPs by community pharmacists in Saudi Arabia when dispensing OTC medication for three minor ailments: diarrhea, cough, and the common cold. Furthermore, this study identified a number of explanatory factors for this low adherence. Targeting these factors could help change the behavior of pharmacists and decrease undesirable outcomes."

This cross-sectional study was conducted in Magelang, Java, from July to November 2015, in four sub-districts; two previously affected by severe iodine deficiency (area 1) and two that were iodine-sufficient (area 2). Iodine intake was estimated using median urinary iodine concentration in spot samples and mean urinary iodine excretion in 3 x 24-hour samples, thyroid hormones (thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine) were measured in venous blood samples, and iodine content of household salt samples was estimated by titration. We recruited a total of 244 pregnant women, 123 in area 1 and 121 in area 2. Urinary iodine results suggested adequate habitual iodine intakes in both areas (median urinary iodine concentration in area 1: 222 μg/l (interquartile range 189, 276 μg/l), area 2: 264 μg/l (interquartile range 172, 284 μg/l), however, the risk of inadequate intakes increased with advancing trimester (Odds Ratio = 2.59 (95% CI 1.19–5.67) and 3.85 (95% CI 1.64–9.02) at second and third trimesters, respectively). Estimated prevalence of thyroid function disorders was generally low. Salt was iodized to approximately 40 ppm and foods rich in native iodine did not contribute significantly to dietary intakes. Adequately iodized salt continues to prevent iodine insufficiency in pregnant women living in areas previously affected by severe iodine deficiency in Java, Indonesia. Monitoring and surveillance, particularly in vulnerable groups, should be emphasized to ensure iodine sufficiency prevails."
https://openalex.org/W3104916836,"Meningitis is one of the top ten causes of death among Ethiopian infants. Group B streptococcus (GBS) has emerged as a leading cause of meningitis in neonates and young infants, resulting in high mortality. Despite this, there is no report on GBS associated meningitis in Ethiopia where infant meningitis is common. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the proportion of GBS associated meningitis among Ethiopian infants. PCR was prospectively used to detect GBS in culture-negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, which were collected from infants suspected for meningitis, at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Ethiopia, over a one-year period. GBS was detected by PCR in 63.9% of culture-negative CSF samples. Out of the 46 GBS positive infants, 10.9% (n = 5) of them died. The late onset of GBS (LOGBS) disease was noted to have a poor outcome with 3 LOGBS out of 5 GBS positive samples collected from patients with the final outcome of death. PCR was advantageous in the identification of GBS in culture-negative CSF samples. GBS was detected in 64% of the CSF samples from infants with meningitis compared with zero-detection rate by culture."

A study investigated changes in behavioural variables, physiological biomarkers, and health parameters following acaricidal treatment of PRM infestation of laying hens on a commercial farm. Mite traps determined the challenge to 12,700 hens before and after drinking water administration of the acaricide, fluralaner (Exzolt ® , 0.5 mg/kg; Weeks 0 and 1). Weekly daytime direct observations and night-time video recordings monitored bird behaviours from Weeks -6 through +6. Blood samples were collected from randomly-selected birds (Weeks -6, -1, and +6). Following treatment, mite count reductions (&gt;99%) were statistically significant ( P &lt; 0.0001), as were night-time reductions in the percent of hens showing activity, preening, head scratching (all P &lt; 0.0001), and head shaking ( P = 0.0007). Significant daytime reductions were observed in preening and head scratching (both P &lt; 0.0001), head shaking ( P = 0.0389), severe feather pecking ( P = 0.0002), and aggressive behaviour ( P = 0.0165). Post-treatment, comb wounds were significantly reduced ( P = 0.0127), and comb colour was significantly improved ( P &lt; 0.0001). Heterophil/lymphocyte ratio was significantly reduced at Weeks 1 and 6 ( P = 0.0009 and P &lt; 0.0001, respectively). At Week 6, blood corticosterone ( P = 0.0041) and total oxidant status ( P &lt; 0.0001) were significantly reduced, and haemoglobin and mean corpuscular haemoglobin significantly increased ( P &lt; 0.0001). Farm production records indicated that those post-treatment improvements were accompanied by significant reductions in weekly mortality rate ( P = 0.0169), and significant recovery in mean weekly egg weights ( P &lt; 0.0001) and laying rate (P &lt; 0.0001). The improvements in behavioural variables, physiological biomarkers, and health parameters that were observed following the elimination of PRM on a commercial farm indicate that infestations can be a cause of reduced hen welfare."
https://openalex.org/W3104390903,"Small (s)RNAs play crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression and genome stability across eukaryotes where they direct epigenetic modifications, post-transcriptional gene silencing, and defense against both endogenous and exogenous viruses. It is known that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , a well-studied unicellular green algae species, possesses sRNA-based mechanisms that are distinct from those of land plants. However, definition of sRNA loci and further systematic classification is not yet available for this or any other algae. Here, using data-driven machine learning approaches including Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and clustering, we have generated a comprehensively annotated and classified sRNA locus map for C. reinhardtii. This map shows some common characteristics with higher plants and animals, but it also reveals distinct features. These results are consistent with the idea that there was diversification in sRNA mechanisms after the evolutionary divergence of algae from higher plant lineages."
https://openalex.org/W3105689204,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy has dramatically reduced HIV vertical transmission rates. Consequently, there is a growing number of children that are HIV exposed uninfected (CHEUs). Studies suggest that CHEUs exposed in utero to ART may experience developmental delays compared to their peers. We investigated the effects of in utero ART exposure on perinatal neurodevelopment in mice, through assessment of developmental milestones. Developmental milestone tests (parallel to reflex testing in human infants) are reflective of brain maturity and useful in predicting later behavioral outcomes. We hypothesized that ART in pregnancy alters the in utero environment and thereby alters developmental milestone outcomes in pups. Throughout pregnancy, dams were treated with boosted-atazanavir combined with either abacavir/lamivudine (ATV/r/ABC/3TC), or tenofovir/emtricitabine (ATV/r/TDF/FTC), or water as control. Pups were assessed daily for general somatic growth and on a battery of tests for primitive reflexes including surface-righting, negative-geotaxis, cliff-aversion, rooting, ear-twitch, auditory-reflex, forelimb-grasp, air-righting, behaviors in the neonatal open field, and olfactory test. In utero exposure to either ART regimen delayed somatic growth in offspring and evoked significant delays in the development of negative geotaxis, cliff-aversion, and ear-twitch reflexes. Exposure to ATV/r/ABC/3TC was also associated with olfactory deficits in male and forelimb grasp deficits in female pups. To explore whether delays persisted into adulthood we assessed performance in the open field test. We observed no significant differences between treatment arm for males. In females, ATV/r/TDF/FTC exposure was associated with lower total distance travelled and less ambulatory time in the centre, while ATV/r/ABC/3TC exposure was associated with higher resting times compared to controls. In utero PI-based ART exposure delays the appearance of primitive reflexes that involve vestibular and sensory-motor pathways in a mouse model. Our findings suggest that ART could be disrupting the normal progress/maturation of the underlying neurocircuits and encourage further investigation for underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3099647680,"The Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC)-null trait, common among persons of African descent and associated with lower absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs), may be linked to increased risk to certain infections including HIV-1 but the underlying causes are poorly understood. We hypothesized that DARC-null-linked neutropenia may negatively impact neutrophil immunoregulatory modulation of other immune cells such as natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells leading to altered phenotype, functionality and homeostatic activity of these immune cells. HIV-1 uninfected (n = 20) and HIV-1 chronically infected (n = 19) participants were assessed using multi-parametric flow cytometry to determine NK and CD8+ T cell counts, phenotypic profiles, and cytokine production and degranulation. Annexin V and carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining were used to examine NK cell survival and NK cell and CD8+ T cell proliferation respectively. Participants were genotyped for the DARC-null polymorphism using allelic discrimination assays and ANCs were measured by full blood count. In HIV uninfected individuals, a reduction of total NK cell counts was noted in the absence of DARC and this correlated with lower ANCs. HIV uninfected DARC-null subjects displayed a less mature NK cell phenotype. However, this did not translate to differences in NK cell activation or effector functionality by DARC state. Whilst HIV-1 infected subjects displayed NK cell profiling that is typical of HIV infection, no differences were noted upon DARC stratification. Similarly, CD8+ T cells from HIV infected individuals displayed phenotypic and functional modulation that is characteristic of HIV infection, but profiling was unaffected by the DARC-null variant irrespective of HIV status. Overall, the data suggests that the DARC-null polymorphism and lower ANCs does not impede downstream cytolytic cell priming and functionality."
https://openalex.org/W3100488600,"Platelets parameters including platelet count (PLT), plateletcrit (PCT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) are associated with various physiological and pathological functions in various disease. However, few studies have addressed whether perinatal factors may be associated with platelet parameters at birth in a large cohort of late preterm and term neonates. The aim of this study to investigate perinatal factors affecting platelet parameters in late preterm and term neonates. We retrospectively investigated platelet parameters including PLT, PCT, MPV, and PDW on the first day of life in 142 late preterm and 258 term neonates admitted to our NICU from 2006 through 2020. PLT, MPV, PCT, PDW on Day 0 did not significantly differ between the two groups. In term neonates, multivariate analysis revealed that PCT correlated with being small for gestational age (SGA) ( β = -0.168, P = 0.006), pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) ( β = -0.135, P = 0.026) and male sex ( β = -0.185, P = 0.002). PLT was associated with SGA ( β = -0.186, P = 0.002), PIH ( β = -0.137, P = 0.024) and male sex ( β = -0.166, P = 0.006). In late preterm neonates, multivariate analysis revealed that PLT were associated with PIH, whereas no factors associated with PDW and MPV were found. In all patients studied, chorioamnionitis (CAM) was significantly associated with MPV (CAM = 10.3 fL vs. no CAM = 9.7 fL, P &lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that SGA, male sex and PIH were associated with PCT and PLT. This study demonstrates that different maternal and neonatal complications affect platelet parameters in late preterm and term neonates."
https://openalex.org/W3101140852,"Synonymous codon usage bias (SCUB) of both nuclear and organellar genes can mirror the evolutionary specialization of plants. The polyploidization process exposes the nucleus to genomic shock, a syndrome which promotes, among other genetic variants, SCUB. Its effect on organellar genes has not, however, been widely addressed. The present analysis targeted the chloroplast genomes of two leading polyploid crop species, namely cotton and bread wheat. The frequency of codons in the chloroplast genomes ending in either adenosine (NNA) or thymine (NNT) proved to be higher than those ending in either guanidine or cytosine (NNG or NNC), and this difference was conserved when comparisons were made between polyploid and diploid forms in both the cotton and wheat taxa. Preference for NNA/T codons was heterogeneous among genes with various numbers of introns and was also differential among the exons. SCUB patterns distinguished tetraploid cotton from its diploid progenitor species, as well as bread wheat from its diploid/tetraploid progenitor species, indicating that SCUB in the chloroplast genome partially mirrors the formation of polyploidies."
https://openalex.org/W3101689894,"Elevated Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) risk has been associated with the use of several antihypertensive medications but has not yet been elucidated in the populations prescribed alpha-1 blockers that are commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS-BPH). The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between alpha-1 blocker use and the risk of developing RCC using a nationwide population-based database in Taiwan. Patients who were treated with alpha-1 blockers for at least 28 days were identified through the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database from 2000 to 2010. The unexposed participants were matched with the exposed cases according to age, sex, and index year at a ratio of 3:1. Cox proportional hazards regression, stratified by sex and comorbidities and adjusted for age, was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of subsequent RCC. Among 2,232,092 subjects, patients who received alpha-1 blocker treatment had a higher risk of RCC than the unexposed group. Taking into account hypertension and BPH, the adjusted HR was significantly higher in male alpha-1 blocker users who had no BPH and either the presence (HR: 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22–2.18) or absence (HR: 2.31, 95% CI = 1.40–3.81) of hypertension than in men not receiving these drugs. Taken together, male alpha-1 blocker users who had no comorbidity of BPH exhibited an increased risk for developing RCC independent of hypertension. Further study is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of this association."
https://openalex.org/W3103834112,"Reciprocity toward a partner’s cooperation is a fundamental behavioral strategy underlying human cooperation not only in interactions with familiar persons but also with strangers. However, a strategy that takes into account not only one’s partner’s previous action but also one’s own previous action—such as a win-stay lose-shift strategy or variants of reinforcement learning—has also been considered an advantageous strategy. This study investigated empirically how behavioral models can be used to explain the variances in cooperative behavior among people. To do this, we considered games involving either direct reciprocity (an iterated prisoner’s dilemma) or generalized reciprocity (a gift-giving game). Multilevel models incorporating inter-individual behavioral differences were fitted to experimental data using Bayesian inference. The results indicate that for these two types of games, a model that considers both one’s own and one’s partner’s previous actions fits the empirical data better than the other models. In the direct reciprocity game, mutual cooperation or defection—rather than relying solely on one’s partner’s previous actions—affected the increase or decrease, respectively, in subsequent cooperation. Whereas in the generalized reciprocity game, a weaker effect of mutual cooperation or defection on subsequent cooperation was observed."
https://openalex.org/W3103852522,"Objectives We investigated the incidence and characteristics of pseudo-spontaneous nystagmus (PSN) in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the lateral semicircular canal (LC-BPPV) and evaluated the correlation between PSN and the bow and lean test. Methods We examined nystagmus in the sitting position using video-oculography goggles in 131 LC-BPPV patients. The positioning test and bow and lean test were also performed. Patients were divided into canalolithiasis and cupulolithiasis groups according to the character of nystagmus. In each group, the incidence and direction of PSN, correlation with the bow and lean test, and treatment outcome were analyzed. Results PSN was observed in 25 cases (19.1%) in LC-BPPV patients, 7 of which were canalolithiasis and 18 of which were cupulolithiasis ( p = 0.098). Of the 25 patients with PSN, 21 (84%) exhibited nystagmus consistent with the lean test whereas 4 (16%) exhibited nystagmus consistent with the bow test. In patients with PSN, nystagmus was observed in the bow and lean test in all cases (23/23), but in patients without PSN, no nystagmus was observed in 13 cases (13/87) in the bow and lean test ( p = 0.048). The number of barbecue maneuvers performed until the end of treatment was 1.4 ± 0.7 in patients with PSN and 1.4 ± 0.9 in those without PSN ( p = 0.976). Conclusion We identified PSN in patients with LC-BPPV irrelevant of subtype. Moreover, all patients with PSN showed nystagmus in the bow and lean test. The direction of PSN was mostly consistent with that of the lean test (21/25, 84%). The presence of PSN was not related to the treatment outcome in this study."

https://openalex.org/W3100631049,"Mitochondrial fusion and fission are dynamic processes regulated by the cellular microenvironment. Under nutrient starvation conditions, mitochondrial fusion is strengthened for energy conservation. We have previously shown that newborns of Ubl4A-deficient mice were more sensitive to starvation stress with a higher rate of mortality than their wild-type littermates. Ubl4A binds with the actin-related protein Arp2/3 complex to synergize the actin branching process. Here, we showed that deficiency in Ubl4A resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis. A defect in the fusion process was the main cause of the mitochondrial fragmentation and resulted from a shortage of primed Arp2/3 complex pool around the mitochondria in the Ubl4A-deficient cells compared to the wild-type cells. As a result, the mitochondrial fusion process was not undertaken quickly enough to sustain starvation stress-induced cell death. Consequently, fragmented mitochondria lost their membrane integrity and ROS was accumulated to trigger caspase 9-dependent apoptosis before autophagic rescue. Furthermore, the wild-type Ubl4A, but not the Arp2/3-binding deficient mutant, could rescue the starvation-induced mitochondrial fragmentation phenotype. These results suggest that Ubl4A promotes the mitochondrial fusion process via Arp2/3 complex during the initial response to nutrient deprivation for cell survival."

Here, we report functional and structural analyses on CMM-binding protein (CMMBP), which is a substrate-binding protein (SBP) of an ABC importer system of the bacteria Arthrobacter globiformis . Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis revealed that CMMBP specifically bound to CMM with a K d value of 9.6 nM. The crystal structure of CMMBP was determined at a resolution of 1.47 Å, and a panose molecule was bound in a cleft between two domains. To delineate its structural features, the crystal structure of CMMBP was compared with other SBPs specific for carbohydrates, such as cyclic α-nigerosyl-(1→6)-nigerose and cyclodextrins. These results indicate that A . globiformis has a unique metabolic pathway specialized for CMM."

https://openalex.org/W3101475435,"Cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease, is a leading cause of death worldwide. Improvement of the secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease is necessary. We established a unique referral system to connect hospitals and outpatient clinics to coordinate care between general practitioners and cardiologists. Here, we evaluated the impact and long-term benefits of our system for ischemic heart disease patients undergoing secondary prevention therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention. This single-center retrospective observational study included 3658 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention at Shizuoka City Hospital between 2010 and 2019. After percutaneous coronary intervention, patients were considered conventional outpatients (conventional follow-up group) or subjected to our unique referral system (referral system group) at the attending cardiologist’s discretion. To audit compliance of the treatment with the latest Japanese guidelines, we adopted a circulation-type referral system, whereby general practitioners needed to refer registered patients at least once a year, even if no cardiac events occurred. Clinical events in each patient were evaluated. Net adverse clinical events were defined as a combination of major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular, and major bleeding events. There were 2241 and 1417 patients in the conventional follow-up and referral system groups, with mean follow-ups of 1255 and 1548 days and cumulative net adverse clinical event incidences of 27.6% and 21.5%, respectively. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the occurrence of net adverse clinical events was significantly lower in the referral system group than in the conventional follow-up group (log-rank: P&lt;0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the unique referral system was a significant predictor of the net clinical benefits (hazard ratio: 0.56, 95% confidence interval: 0.37–0.83, P = 0.004). This result was consistent after propensity-score matching. In summary, our unique referral system contributed to long-term net clinical benefits for the secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention."
