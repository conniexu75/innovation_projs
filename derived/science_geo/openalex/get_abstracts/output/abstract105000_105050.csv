https://openalex.org/W1987334490,"A model that makes use of the cooperative organization of inorganic and organic molecular species into three dimensionally structured arrays is generalized for the synthesis of nanocomposite materials. In this model, the properties and structure of a system are determined by dynamic interplay among ion-pair inorganic and organic species, so that different phases can be readily obtained through small variations of controllable synthesis parameters, including mixture composition and temperature. Nucleation, growth, and phase transitions may be directed by the charge density, coordination, and steric requirements of the inorganic and organic species at the interface and not necessarily by a preformed structure. A specific example is presented in which organic molecules in the presence of multiply charged silicate oligomers self-assemble into silicatropic liquid crystals. The organization of these silicate-surfactant mesophases is investigated with and without interfacial silicate condensation to separate the effects of self-assembly from the kinetics of silicate polymerization."

The phenotype of these mice involves both cellular hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and a lack of B and T cell immunity. The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, p350, was identified as a strong candidate for the murine gene SCID. Both p350 and a gene complementing the SCID defect colocalize to human chromosome 8q11. Chromosomal fragments expressing p350 complement the SCID phenotype, and p350 protein levels are greatly reduced in cells derived from SCID mice compared to cells from wild-type mice."
https://openalex.org/W2112210924,"The cycling bioluminescence of Arabidopsis plants carrying a firefly luciferase fusion construct was used to identify mutant individuals with aberrant cycling patterns. Both long- and short-period mutants were recovered. A semidominant short-period mutation, timing of CAB expression (toc1), was mapped to chromosome 5. The toc1 mutation shortens the period of two distinct circadian rhythms, the expression of chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (CAB) genes and the movements of primary leaves, although toc1 mutants do not show extensive pleiotropy for other phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W2044874191,"The radiosensitive rodent mutant cell line xrs-5 is defective in DNA double-strand break repair and lacks the Ku component of the DNA-activated protein kinase, DNA-PK. Here radiosensitive human cell lines were analyzed for DNA-PK activity and for the presence of related proteins. The radiosensitive human malignant glioma M059J cell line was found to be defective in DNA double-strand break repair, but fails to express the p350 subunit of DNA-PK. These results suggest that DNA-PK kinase activity is involved in DNA double-strand break repair."

https://openalex.org/W2099942500,"Adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), ARF6 mutants, and ARF1 were transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the effects on receptor-mediated endocytosis were assessed. Overexpressed ARF6 localized to the cell periphery and led to a redistribution of transferrin receptors to the cell surface and a decrease in the rate of uptake of transferrin. Similar results were obtained when a mutant defective in guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis was expressed. Expression of a dominant negative mutant, ARF6(T27N), resulted in an intracellular distribution of transferrin receptors and an inhibition of transferrin recycling to the cell surface. In contrast, overexpression of ARF1 had little or no effect on these parameters of endocytosis."

Atomic force microscopy was used to measure the binding strength between cell adhesion proteoglycans from a marine sponge. Under physiological conditions, the adhesive force between two cell adhesion molecules was found to be up to 400 piconewtons. Thus a single pair of molecules could hold the weight of 1600 cells. High intermolecular binding forces are likely to form the basis for the integrity of the multicellular sponge organism."

https://openalex.org/W2007157318,"Transcription control regions of eukaryotic genes contain multiple sequence elements proposed to function independently to regulate transcription. We developed transgenic mice carrying fos-lacZ fusion genes with clustered point mutations in each of several distinct regulatory sequences: the sis-inducible element, the serum response element, the fos AP-1 site, and the calcium/cAMP response element. Analysis of Fos-lacZ expression in the CNS and in cultured cells demonstrated that all of the regulatory elements tested were required in concert for tissue- and stimulus-specific regulation of the c-fos promoter. This implies that the regulation of c-fos expression requires the concerted action of multiple control elements that direct the assembly of an interdependent transcription complex."

https://openalex.org/W1981185926,"In the present study we have identified the extracellular matrix protein agrin as a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) in embryonic chick brain. Using monoclonal antibodies and a polyclonal antiserum to the core protein of a previously identified HSPG from embryonic chick brain, our expression screened a random-primed E9 chick brain cDNA library. Twelve cDNAs were isolated that were shown to be identical to the chick extracellular matrix protein agrin. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry confirmed that agrin is a HSPG that is identical with the HSPG from embryonic chick brain. A polyclonal antiserum to recombinant agrin protein recognized agrin as a diffuse band of over 400 kDa in extracts from brain and vitreous humor. The agrin immunoreactivity on the blot was shifted to a defined band of approximately 250 kDa after treatment of the samples with heparitinase or nitrous acid, and this banding pattern was indistinguishable from immunoreactivity obtained with antibodies to the brain HSPG. We also show that agrin binds tightly to anion exchange beads, indicating that the molecule is highly negatively charged, which is a hallmark of all proteoglycans. Furthermore, the agrin antiserum recognizes the affinity purified HSPG from chick brain and vitreous humor. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that agrin is expressed in developing brain, and is especially abundant in developing axonal tracts, in a distribution identical to the staining of the brain HSPG with monoclonal antibodies. We also show that the anti-HSPG antibodies stain the synaptic site of the neuromuscular junction, in agreement with agrin expression. Thus, our studies demonstrate that chick agrin is a HSPG that is prominent in the embryonic chick brain. Since previous studies from our laboratories have shown that this proteoglycan interacts with neural cell adhesion molecule, our studies raise the interesting possibility that neural cell adhesion molecule and agrin are interactive partners that may regulate a variety of cell adhesion processes during neural development, including synaptogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2128751701,"Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a luciferase gene fused to a circadian-regulated promoter exhibited robust rhythms in bioluminescence. The cyclic luminescence has a 24.7-hour period in white light but 30- to 36-hour periods under constant darkness. Either red or blue light shortened the period of the wild type to 25 hours. A phytochrome-deficient mutation lengthened the period in continuous red light but had little effect in continuous blue light, whereas seedlings carrying mutations that activate light-dependent pathways in darkness maintained shorter periods in constant darkness. These results suggest that both phytochrome- and blue light-responsive photoreceptor pathways control the period of the circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W1998589171,"Direct measurement of the kinetics of kinesin dissociation from microtubules, the release of phosphate and ADP from kinesin, and rebinding of kinesin to the microtubule have defined the mechanism for the kinesin ATPase cycle. The processivity of ATP hydrolysis is ten molecules per site at low salt concentration but is reduced to one ATP per site at higher salt concentration. Kinesin dissociates from the microtubule after ATP hydrolysis. This step is rate-limiting. The subsequent rebinding of kinesin - ADP to the microtubule is fast, so kinesin spends only a small fraction of its duty cycle in the dissociated state. These results provide an explanation for the motility differences between skeletal myosin and kinesin."

https://openalex.org/W1972204126,"An in vitro system reconstituted from purified proteins has been used to examine what happens when the DNA replication apparatus of bacteriophage T4 collides with an Escherichia coli RNA polymerase ternary transcription complex that is poised to move in the direction opposite to that of the moving replication fork. In the absence of a DNA helicase, the replication fork stalls for many minutes after its encounter with the RNA polymerase. However, when the T4 gene 41 DNA helicase is present, the replication fork passes the RNA polymerase after a pause of a few seconds. This brief pause is longer than the pause observed for a codirectional collision between the same two polymerases, suggesting that there is an inherent disadvantage to having replication and transcription directions oriented head to head. As for a codirectional collision, the RNA polymerase remains competent to resume faithful RNA chain elongation after the DNA replication fork passes; most strikingly, the RNA polymerase has switched from its original template strand to use the newly synthesized daughter DNA strand as the template."
https://openalex.org/W1985882391,"Exonuclease I (Exo I) from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a 5'-->3' double-stranded DNA exonuclease, is induced during meiotic prophase I. The exo1 gene is a member of a family of related DNA repair genes, including RAD2/rad13/xpgc and YKL510/rad2, conserved from yeast to humans. An exo1 mutant displays a mutator phenotype and alters activity of the ade6-M387 marker effect. These results suggest that Exo I acts in a pathway that corrects mismatched base pairs."

https://openalex.org/W2075326322,"The precise mechanism by which insulin regulates glucose metabolism is not fully understood. However, it is known that insulin activates two enzymes, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI 3′-K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which may be involved in stimulating the metabolic effects of insulin. The role of these enzymes in glucose metabolism was examined by comparing the effects of insulin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Treatment of the cells with PDGF or EGF for 5 min increased the MAPK activity 3-5-fold, while insulin treatment produced a 2.5-fold increase. The MAPK activity remained elevated for 1 h after either PDGF or insulin treatment. PDGF and insulin, but not EGF, caused a transient increase in the amount PI 3′-K activity coprecipitated with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. Although PDGF and insulin caused a similar increase in the activities of these two enzymes, only insulin caused substantial increases in glucose utilization. Insulin increased the transport of glucose and the synthesis of lipid 4- and 17-fold, respectively, while PDGF did not affect these processes significantly. Glycogen synthesis was increased 15-fold in response to insulin and only 3-fold in response to PDGF. Thus, the activation of MAPK and PI 3′-K are not sufficient for the complete stimulation of glucose transport, lipid synthesis, or glycogen synthesis by hormones in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, suggesting a requirement for other signaling mechanisms that may be uniquely responsive to insulin.

https://openalex.org/W2044923435,"Assembly of protein metallocenters is not well understood. Urease offers a tractable system for examination of this process. Formation of the urease metallocenter in vivo is known to require four accessory proteins: UreD, postulated to be a urease-specific molecular chaperone; UreE, a nickel(II)-binding protein; and UreF and UreG, of unknown function. Activation of purified Klebsiella aerogenes urease apoprotein was accomplished in vitro by providing carbon dioxide (half-maximal activation at approximately 0.2 percent carbon dioxide) in addition to nickel ion. Activation coincided with carbon dioxide incorporation into urease in a pH-dependent reaction (pKa > or = 9, where Ka is the acid constant). The concentration of carbon dioxide also affected the amount of activation of UreD-urease apoprotein complexes. These results suggest that carbon dioxide binding to urease apoprotein generates a ligand that facilitates productive nickel binding."
https://openalex.org/W2028214516,"The periods of circadian clocks are relatively temperature-insensitive. Indeed, the perL mutation in the Drosophila melanogaster period gene, a central component of the clock, affects temperature compensation as well as period length. The per protein (PER) contains a dimerization domain (PAS) within which the perL mutation is located. Amino acid substitutions at the perL position rendered PER dimerization temperature-sensitive. In addition, another region of PER interacted with PAS, and the perL mutation enhanced this putative intramolecular interaction, which may compete with PAS-PAS intermolecular interactions. Therefore, temperature compensation of circadian period in Drosophila may be due in part to temperature-independent PER activity, which is based on competition between inter- and intramolecular interactions with similar temperature coefficients."
https://openalex.org/W1975094465,"Mandelate racemase and muconate lactonizing enzyme are structurally homologous but catalyze different reactions, each initiated by proton abstraction from carbon. The structural similarity to mandelate racemase of a previously unidentified gene product was used to deduce its function as a galactonate dehydratase. In this enzyme superfamily that has evolved to catalyze proton abstraction from carbon, three variations of homologous active site architectures are now represented: lysine and histidine bases in the active site of mandelate racemase, only a lysine base in the active site of muconate lactonizing enzyme, and only a histidine base in the active site of galactonate dehydratase. This discovery supports the hypothesis that new enzymatic activities evolve by recruitment of a protein catalyzing the same type of chemical reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2009949333,"The photoreceptor neurons (R cells) of the Drosophila compound eye elaborate a precise array of neuronal connections in the brain. These projections exhibit target specificity and create topographic maps (retinotopy). We have screened histologically for mutations disrupting R cell connectivity in developing tissue. Eighty mutations were isolated from over 6000 ethylmethane sulfonate-mutagenized lines. Characterization of these mutations included genetic mosaic analysis to determine whether the gene is required in the retina or in the optic ganglia. Most mutations were found to affect connectivity indirectly by disrupting development more generally in the eye or brain. Genes were identified as candidates for playing direct roles in R cell connectivity by affecting axonal outgrowth (eddy), target recognition (limbo and nonstop), and retinotopy (limbo)."

https://openalex.org/W2093809397,"All visual sensors, biological and artificial, are finite in resolution by necessity. As a result, the effective reflectance of surfaces in a scene varies with magnification. A reflectance model for matte surfaces is described that incorporates the effect of macroscopic surface undulations on image brightness. The model takes into account complex physical phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between points on the surface, and it predicts the appearance of a wide range of natural surfaces. The implications of these results for human vision, machine vision, and computer graphics are demonstrated with both real and rendered images of three-dimensional objects. In particular, objects with extremely rough surfaces produce silhouette images devoid of shading, precluding visual perception of the object's shape."
https://openalex.org/W1983069964,"The restricted expression of some genes to distinct stages of the cell cycle is often brought about through alterations in the activity and/or abundance of specific transcription factors. Many cells have been shown to be unresponsive to glucocorticoid hormone action during the G2 phase of the mammalian cell cycle, suggesting that some activities of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, are subjected to cell cycle control. We show here that GR insensitivity in G2 is selective, affecting receptor-mediated transactivation from a simple glucocorticoid response element, but not repression from a composite glucocorticoid response element. Since glucocorticoid-dependent down-regulation of GR protein levels is also unaffected in G2, distinct activities of the receptor that participate in this homologous down-regulation must be operating as effectively in G2-synchronized cells as in asynchronous cells. Finally, the phosphorylation state of the GR is altered in G2-synchronized cells reflecting, in part, both site-specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. These results suggest that, while GR may be a target for cell cycle regulated kinases and phosphatases, the resulting changes in receptor phosphorylation have an impact only on selected GR functions.

Steroid hormones elicit complex responses within cells predominantly through the action of intracellular receptor proteins which are members of a large superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar). Members of this superfamily of transcription factors have the capacity to regulate transcription either via their interactions with specific target sequences linked to hormonally responsive genes(2Beato M.

We report here our examination of G2 effects on GR transactivation and repression brought about through GR interactions with a promoter-linked simple and composite glucocorticoid response element (GRE), respectively. Likewise, we have extended our previous analysis (24Hsu S.-C. Qi M. DeFranco D.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3457-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) of cell cycle regulation of GR phosphorylation. Our results reveal that GR insensitivity during the G2 phase of the cell cycle applies to selective GR functions, i.e. transactivation, but not repression. Furthermore, we show that complex changes in GR phosphorylation occur during G2, which include alterations in both overall phosphorylation and site-specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

Endocrinol. 1992; 7: 26-34Google Scholar). Significance of the data was determined using a two-tailed Student's t test. GRs were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates (30DeFranco D.B. Qi M.

Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 274-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. The quantitative recovery of GR from cell lysates was confirmed by a second round of immunoprecipitations which typically did not yield detectable levels of GR. Western blots were performed(32Qi M. Hamilton B.J. DeFranco D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and GRs were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Corp.). Relative levels of GR were measured by densitometric analysis of autoradiographs. Cells (1 × 100-mm diameter culture dish) were incubated with 70 μCi of [35S]methionine and 3 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 7 h. Immunoprecipitated GRs were gel-purified (30DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and extracted with 30% hydrogen peroxide. 35S and 32P incorporated into GR was quantified using a Beckman LS 1701 liquid scintillation system. Tryptic digests and two-dimensional mapping of 32P-labeled GR peptides were performed as described previously(30DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The relative phosphorylation within individual peptides was quantified using an Ambis Radioanalytic Imager. To compare the relative phosphorylation within individual peptides between different thin layer plates, a reference peptide was chosen whose phosphorylation, in multiple trials, was unchanged by G2 synchronization. The impairment of glucocorticoid-induced gene expression during the G2 phase of the cell cycle has been shown to reflect, in part, an inhibition of GR-mediated transactivation(24Hsu S.-C. Qi M. DeFranco D.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3457-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The precise arrangement (33Strähle U. Schmid W. Schütz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3389-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and occupancy (34Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) of distinct transcription factors at glucocorticoid-responsive promoters can influence the ability of the GR bound to linked GREs to activate transcription. We therefore set out to determine whether the inhibition of GR transactivation during G2 is due to a disruption of complex interactions between the receptor and transcription factors obligatory for hormone-induced transcription. To eliminate the contribution to glucocorticoid induced transcription of other transcription factors such as OTF-1(35Brüggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whose activity may be cell cycle-regulated(20Boseman Roberts S. Segil N. Heintz N. Science. 1991; 253: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we analyzed the function of a simple GRE linked to a minimal promoter possessing only a TATA-box element directing basal transcription. The TAT3CAT reporter plasmid, which possesses three tandem copies of a simple GRE derived from the TAT gene linked to a minimal promoter from the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase gene(36Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar), was stably transfected into GrH2 rat hepatoma cells(28Howard K.J. Holley S.J. Yamamoto K.R. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11928-11935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and glucocorticoid induction of CAT activity was measured in asynchronous and G2-synchronized cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, with a cell synchronization paradigm that uses Hoescht 33342(29Tobey R.A. Oishi N. Crissman H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5104-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we were able to generate a population of GrH2 cells >80% enriched in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. This synchronization was readily reversible (Fig. 1B) as a population of cells 45% enriched in G1 was obtained following a 6-h withdrawal from medium containing Hoescht 33342. As shown in Fig. 2A, transcription from a stably integrated TAT3CAT reporter was effectively induced by dexamethasone in asynchronous GrH2 cells, but not in G2-synchronized cells. Transcriptional activity of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter, which is not hormonally responsive(37DeFranco D. Yamamoto K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), was not significantly affected by G2 synchronization of GrH2 cells (Fig. 2C). Importantly, the inhibition of GR transactivation from the TAT3CAT reporter in G2-synchronized cells demonstrates that G2 effects on GR transactivation activity apply even when expression from the GRE-linked promoter is driven by basal components of the transcriptional machinery.Figure 2:GR function at a simple, but not composite GRE, is inhibited in G2-synchronized GrH2 cells. Asynchronous (asyn) and G2-synchronized GrH2 cell lines stably transfected with TAT3 (A), plfG3 (B), or Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (C) CAT reporter plasmid were either untreated(-) or treated (+) with 0.1 μM dexamethasone (dex) for 6 h. CAT assays were performed using equivalent amounts of protein in crude cell-free lysates. Average CAT activity (n = 3) is expressed relative to that obtained in untreated asynchronous cells. The 30 and 50% dexamethasone repression of plfG3 CAT activity observed in asynchronous and G2-synchronized cells, respectively, was statistically significant (p < 0.005) as determined using a two-tailed Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GRs are bifunctional transcription factors which can act, in certain contexts, as transcriptional repressors as well as activators(36Diamond M.I.

Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). While various mechanisms account for GR-mediated transcriptional repression(4Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), a composite GRE (cGRE) located within the rat proliferin gene can direct the GR to activate or repress transcription from a linked promoter depending upon the composition of AP-1 transcription factors (41Ransone L.J. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) that co-occupy the cGRE(36Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). To compare the activity of the proliferin cGRE with a simple GRE in G2-synchronized cells, GrH2 cells were stably transfected with a reporter (plfG3) (36Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) possessing the proliferin cGRE linked to the identical Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase minimal promoter that was used to monitor the activity of a simple GRE. As shown in Fig. 2B, plfG3 promoter activity was repressed upon dexamethasone treatment of both asynchronous and G2-synchronized GrH2 cells. The extent of dexamethasone repression of plfG3 promoter activity was similar in asynchronous and G2-synchronized GrH2 cells, despite the fact that basal activity of the plfG3 promoter was reduced in G2-synchronized cells (Fig. 2B). Thus GRs are not completely disabled in G2-synchronized cells, and although they are severely compromised in their ability to activate transcription, they still retain the capacity to repress transcription. GRs act at multiple levels to control the ultimate production of specific gene products. For example, in many cells, GR protein levels are down-regulated in response to glucocorticoid treatment(27Dong Y. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-A. Okret S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 42Burnstein K.L. Bellingham D.L. Jewell C.M. Powell-Oliver F.E. Cidlowski J.A. Steroids. 1991; 56: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 43Danielsen M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This homologous down-regulation in rat HTC hepatoma cells results from glucocorticoid effects on GR protein stability and perhaps GR transcription(27Dong Y. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-A. Okret S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To reveal whether this multilevel regulation of GR expression is sensitive to G2 effects, we used Western blot analysis to quantify GR protein levels. As shown in Fig. 3, a 12-h dexamethasone treatment of either asynchronous or G2-synchronized GrH2 cells led to an analogous down-regulation of GR protein levels. It was impractical to extend the hormone treatment much beyond 12 h in G2-synchronized cells given the decreased ability of GrH2 cells to recover from G2 synchronization upon prolonged treatment with Hoescht 33342 (not shown). Nevertheless, the extent of GR down-regulation apparent following a 12-h dexamethasone treatment is identical (approximately 60% in two separate experiments) in both asynchronous and G2-synchronized GrH2 cells. G2 synchronization of mouse L cell fibroblasts was previously shown to lead to minor changes in GR phosphorylation as detected by two-dimensional tryptic mapping(24Hsu S.-C. Qi M. DeFranco D.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3457-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Tryptic mapping of rat GR phosphopeptides using the identical method (30DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) has generated more well resolved patterns than mouse GR maps(24Hsu S.-C. Qi M. DeFranco D.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3457-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, GR phosphorylation was analyzed in rat GrH2 cells, not only to confirm our previous studies in mouse fibroblasts(24Hsu S.-C. Qi M. DeFranco D.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3457-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but also to potentially uncover any novel alterations in GR phosphorylation that were not well resolved in mouse GR tryptic maps. Initially, we examined overall GR phosphorylation and observed two striking differences between asynchronous and G2-synchronized GrH2 cells. As shown in Table 1, basal phosphorylation of GRs was increased in G2-synchronized cells while no further increase in GR phosphorylation was observed upon dexamethasone treatment. In asynchronous GrH2 cells, dexamethasone treatment led to a 1.9-fold increase in overall GR phosphorylation (Table 1).Tabled 1 Glucocorticoid-induced hyperphosphorylation of the GR has been observed in mouse (44Orti E. Mendel D.B. Smith L.I. Munck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9728-9731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Hoeck W. Rusconi S. Groner B. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and reflects increased overall phosphorylation (Table 1) (44Orti E. Mendel D.B. Smith L.I. Munck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9728-9731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as hyperphosphorylation at specific sites(30DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 4(compare Panels A and B), dexamethasone treatment of GrH2 cells led to prominent hyperphosphorylation of a few specific peptides (peptides g and h), in agreement with our observations in other cultured cell lines(14Somers J.P. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 7: 26-34Google Scholar, 15Moyer M.L. Borror K.C. Bona B.J. DeFranco D.B. Nordeen S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22933-22940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and prominent dephosphorylation of another peptide (peptide c). Other minor variations in spot intensity were not reproducible in GrH2 cells or in different cell lines that we have previously examined(14Somers J.P. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 7: 26-34Google Scholar, 15Moyer M.L. Borror K.C. Bona B.J. DeFranco D.B. Nordeen S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22933-22940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that overall GR phosphorylation was not increased upon dexamethasone treatment of G2-synchronized cells (Table 1), the identical prominent hyperphosphorylation of GR peptides g and h was observed in G2-synchronized GrH2 cells (Fig. 4, compare Panels C and D). In fact, the only striking difference in GR phosphorylation between asynchronous and G2-synchronized cells was observed on peptide d. In the absence of dexamethasone treatment, peptide d was hyperphosphorylated 2-fold in G2-synchronized cells relative to asynchronous cells (Fig. 4, compare Panels A and C). The closely migrating peptide c was shown to be phosphorylated to the same extent in asynchronous and G2-synchronized cells using identical means for quantifying phosphorylation within individual peptides (see “Materials and Methods”). It seems unlikely that this hyperphosphorylation accounts entirely for increased overall phosphorylation of GR observed in G2-synchronized cells (Table 1), as we have previously determined that this peptide accounts for only approximately 10% of total GR phosphorylation in rat cell lines (not shown). In addition to this change in constitutive phosphorylation of peptide d, dexamethasone treatment of G2-synchronized cells led to a dephosphorylation of this peptide (Fig. 4, compare Panels C to D). Using a peptide whose level of phosphorylation was not significantly affected by dexamethasone as a reference, the relative extent of peptide d phosphorylation was shown to be reduced by 60% upon dexamethasone treatment of G2-synchronized cells. A less dramatic dephosphorylation of peptide d was noted upon dexamethasone treatment of asynchronous cells (Fig. 4, compare Panels A to B). Thus, the lack of overall hormone-induced hyperphosphorylation of GRs in G2-synchronized cells is misleading as analysis of GR phosphorylation at specific sites revealed both hormone-induced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation during G2. There are a limited number of genes whose expression is restricted to specific stages of the cell cycle(46McKinney J.D. Heintz N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 430-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This feature applies both to genes whose products serve an important regulatory role in cell cycle progression, such as G1(47Wittenberg C. Sugimoto K. Reed S.I. Cell. 1990; 62: 225-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and G2(48Pines J. Hunter T. Nature. 1990; 346: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) cyclins, and to others which encode proteins more intimately involved in the mechanics of the chromosomal replication (49Kim Y.K. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) condensation(50LaBella F. Gallinari P. McKinney J. Heintz N. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1982-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and segregation(51Kilmartin J.V. Dyos S.L. Kershaw D. Finch J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 10952-10956Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Alterations in the abundance and/or activity of the transcription factors that are required for efficient expression of cell cycle regulated genes often accounts for their restricted expression(46McKinney J.D. Heintz N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 430-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our previous work(24Hsu S.-C. Qi M. DeFranco D.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3457-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and that reported herein, establish that GR transactivation activity is severely impaired in G2-synchronized cells, even from a promoter that utilizes only basal components of transcription machinery. It therefore seems unlikely that G2-specific alterations in the activity of transcription factors required for efficient glucocorticoid induction (35Brüggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) are solely responsible for the refractoriness of endogenous promoters to GR transactivation. Since GR in crude nuclear extracts prepared from G2-synchronized GrH2 cells can bind DNA efficiently in vitro, ( 2S.-C. Hsu and D. B. DeFranco, unpublished observations. )we likewise do not believe that the failure to detect glucocorticoid induction is due to inhibition of GR binding to target GREs. A novel finding presented in this report is that not all nuclear functions of GR are disrupted as GR-mediated repression directed by a cGRE is apparently unaffected in G2-synchronized cells. The mechanism of repression in this case involves the co-occupancy at the cGRE of GR with a specific cohort of AP-1 family members(36Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar), further supporting the notion that GR DNA binding activity is not grossly affected by G2 synchronization. The expression of this transcriptional modulatory function of the GR argues against the possibility that receptors are sequestered during G2 within a subnuclear compartment (52Spector D.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 265-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) that restricts their ability to productively interact with active transcription factors (i.e. AP-1), or that chromatin structural changes in G2 render all target sites inaccessible to the GR. Since the proliferin cGRE can also direct GR to activate transcription from linked promoters (36Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar) in the appropriate context, it would be interesting to examine whether GR transactivation from that element is likely impaired during G2. In G2-synchronized cells, quantitative effects on GR phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were observed. Hormone treatment of both asynchronous and G2-synchronized cells led to dephosphorylation of a single peptide (peptide c), while more extensive dephosphorylation of a different peptide (peptide d) was observed in hormone treated G2-synchronized cells. Since peptide d is hyperphosphorylated in G2-synchronized cells not treated with hormone, the phosphorylation state of GR in hormone treated G2 cells appears remarkably similar to that obtained from asynchronous cells. Thus, basal phosphorylation of the GR, and not its phosphorylation state in hormone treated cells, is what distinguishes the receptor in asynchronous versus G2-synchronized GrH2 cells. If increased basal phosphorylation of GR is responsible for the inhibition of its transactivation activity, perhaps the GR, analogous to other transcription factors such as c-jun(53Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H.K. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), possesses sites that can exert an inhibitory effect on its activity when phosphorylated. The inability of hormone-induced dephosphorylation of GR in G2 to overcome this inhibition could be explained if this dephosphorylation occurs subsequent to receptor interactions with the transcriptional machinery. The amino acid sequences surrounding most mouse GR phosphorylation sites (54Bodwell J.E. Orti E. Coull J.M. Pappin D.J.C. Smith L.I. Swift F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7549-7555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implies that they are likely to be the targets of proline-directed protein kinases which could include members of both the cyclin-directed and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase families (55Hall F.L. Vulliet P.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Obviously, any members of this family that are activated during G2(56Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Ueki K. Izumi T. Chatani Y. Kohno M. Kasuga M. Yazaki Y. Akanuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20293-20297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could account for the site-specific hyperphosphorylation of GR in cells not treated with hormone. Regardless of the identity such GR kinase(s), the resultant hyperphosphorylation of GR does not affect all its nuclear functions, and appears to be associated only with inhibition of transactivation. Both PP-1 and PP-2A have been shown to dephosphorylate specific GR sites in vitro and are implicated in the in vivo dephosphorylation of GR(30DeFranco D.B. Qi M. Borror K.C. Garabedian M.J. Brautigan D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In fact, the hormone-induced dephosphorylation of GR occurs at sites that are major in vitro substrates for PP-1 and PP-2A. Although we have not detected differences in PP-1 and PP-2A activity in crude cell extracts prepared from asynchronous and G2-synchronized cells,2 specific phosphatase targeting subunits (57Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 61-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) could be involved in regulating their activity on GR during G2. Since hormone-induced dephosphorylation in G2 restores a normal GR phosphorylation pattern but not transactivation, protein phosphatases may act at a step in the nuclear processing of GR that follows receptor interactions with the transcriptional machinery. This notion is supported by the fact that a population of GR that is relatively dephosphorylated has been found to be confined to a distinct subnuclear compartment, defined biochemically(58Mendel D.B. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Nature. 1986; 324: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The diversity of endogenous and synthetic glucocorticoid-responsive genes whose induction is inhibited in G2(23Martin Jr., D.W. Tomkins G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 65: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Hsu S.-C. Qi M. DeFranco D.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3457-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 59Fanger B.O. Currie R.A. Cidlowski J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (this report) implicates the receptor as a likely target of G2-specific regulators. While GR interactions with components of the transcriptional machinery that participate in transactivation may be sensitive to some G2-specific biochemical alteration in the receptor, interactions of the receptor with distinct transcription factors that bring about transcriptional repression must be transparent to these biochemical changes. Our results point out the potential influence of both kinases and phosphatases in regulating GR activity, and by demonstrating the specificity in affected GR functions, illustrate the diversity of effects that intracellular signaling pathways could exert on steroid hormone responsiveness.

Treatment of these chondrocytes with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU), which causes the cells to resemble their mesenchymal precursors, resulted in an antiparallel situation, where antisense transcription was lost, and instead, sense strand transcription was acquired, suggesting that the reverse switch from sense to antisense transcription occurs during chondrogenesis. Very large (>10 kilobases) and heterogeneous antisense transcripts of moderate stability were shown to span both ends of the gene in chondrocytes, while their absence was shown in BrdU-treated chondrocytes, chick embryo fibroblasts, and a variety of other tissues. The function of these antisense transcripts is so far unknown, but their unusual chondrocyte-specific appearance, concurrent with little or no sense strand transcription, suggests a possible functional role in the down-regulation of the α1(I) collagen gene.

The gene coding for rat cytochrome b5 was transcribed and the resulting mRNA was translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of microsomes. The binding and topology of cytochrome b5 were investigated by treating microsomes containing the newly incorporated cytochrome b5 with carboxypeptidase Y and trypsin. Our studies indicate that cytochrome b5 is inserted both co- and post-translationally into microsomes in a topology in which the membrane-binding domain spans the bilayer with its COOH terminus in the lumen. Cytochrome b5 is also incorporated into microsomes pretreated with trypsin in a topology indistinguishable from the one resulting from the insertion of the protein into untreated microsomes, reconfirming that cytochrome b5 does not use the signal recognition particle-dependent translocation machinery.

Depending on the location, NT is able to contract or relax intestinal muscle either directly through interaction with smooth muscle cells or indirectly through the activation of neurotransmitter release from intramural nerve endings(2Kitabgi P.

These conclusions are based on indirect evidence based on the blockade of neurotransmitter release by tetrodotoxin. However, binding studies using iodinated NT derivatives(6Kitabgi P. Kwan C.Y.

In contrast to the intestinal effects of NT, the mechanisms of the cardiovascular effects of this peptide are much less well characterized, and it is still unclear if NT acts directly or indirectly on vascular cells. Indeed, intravenous infusion of NT produces species-dependent systemic as well as regional cardiovascular effects(1Carraway R.E. Leeman S.E. J. Biol.

The effects of NT have also been studied in isolated organ experiments, where NT contracted rat portal vein by a histamine-independent mechanism(14Rioux, F., Quirion, R., Leblanc, M. A., Regoli, D., St-Pierre, S., Life Sci., 27, 259–267.Google Scholar), but had no contractile activity on rabbit pulmonary artery(15Obara H. Kusunoki M. Mori M. Mikawa K. Iwai S.

Mizrahi J. Regoli D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 114: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), suggesting that NT may induce smooth muscle relaxation through a direct interaction with endothelial cells via an activation of NO synthase. Subcutaneous injection of NT also produces an increase in cutaneous vascular permeability which can be attributed to either a direct effect of NT on vascular endothelial cells or an indirect histamine-related mechanism (18Carraway R.E. Cochrane D.E. Salmonsen R. Muraki K. Boucher W. Peptides. 1991; 12: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite these numerous in vivo and in vitro pharmacological studies, no NT binding sites have been described on vascular smooth muscle or endothelial cells yet. NT binding to mast cells has been reported(19Lazarus L.H. Perrin M.H. Brown M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7174-7179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lazarus L.H. Perrin M.H. Brown M.R. Rivier J.E. J. Biol.

Checler F. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Rev. Clin. Basic Pharmacol. 1985; 5: 397-486PubMed Google Scholar). We hereby describe the existence and characterization of high affinity NT receptors on human umbilical vein and aortic endothelial cells, suggesting that some of the cardiovascular effects of NT might be due to direct interaction of NT with endothelial cells. (3-[125I]Iodotyrosyl-3)NT (125I-NT, specific activity, 2000 Ci/mmol), [myo-3H]inositol (100 Ci/mmol), and 45CaCl2 (specific activity, 10-40 Ci/mg) were from Amersham Corp. (Les Ulis, France). RPMI 1640 medium and PBS were from Biochrom KG (Poly Labo, Strasbourg, France). Fetal calf serum and human fibronectin were from Boehringer Mannheim (Meylan, France). Heparin, endothelial cell growth supplement, bacitracin, 1,10-phenanthroline, and NT and its fragments were from Sigma (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). SR 48692 was synthesized at Sanofi Recherche (Toulouse, France)(21Gully D. Canton M. Boigegrain R. Jeanjean F. Poncelet M Gueudet C. Heaulme M. Brouard A. Pelaprat D. Labbé-Jullié C. Mazella J.

AG1-X8 resin and chromatography columns were from Bio-Rad (Ivry sur Seine, France). HAECs were obtained from Clonetics (TEBU, Paris, France). HUVECs were from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Oligonucleotides primers and oligoprobe were generous gifts of D. Shire (Sanofi Recherche, Labège, France). HUVECs were routinely cultured in 75-cm2 flasks coated with human fibronectin (5 μg/cm2) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 100 μg/ml heparin, and 30 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement. For experiments, cells were detached by trypsin/EDTA (0.02-0.05%) and seeded in fibronectin-coated 24-well plates (binding experiments), 35-mm Petri dishes (45Ca efflux experiments), or 60-mm dishes (phosphoinositide turnover experiments) and used at confluence. Culture conditions for HAECs were identical to those used for HUVECs. 125I-NT binding experiments were performed on cell monolayers. Medium was aspirated, and cells washed two times with PBS and incubated with 1 ml of binding buffer containing, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 3.6 mM MgCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mM glucose, 40 mg/liter bacitracin, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, and 25 mM Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, in the presence of 125I-NT and the tested compounds. Preliminary experiments showed that, at 20°C, equilibrium was reached after 1 h of incubation. At the end of the incubation period, the buffer was aspirated, and the cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were then digested with 0.1 N NaOH for 2 h, and the resulting solution counted in a γ counter. Results for equilibrium binding experiments, kinetic experiments, and binding inhibition studies were analyzed by a nonlinear regression program(22Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers in 35-mm dishes were incubated overnight with 45CaCl2 (10 μCi/ml). The experiment was started by removal of the medium and replacement by physiological salt solution (PSS, composition: 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 5.6 mM glucose, 1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, 100 mg/liter bacitracin, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, 5 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4) devoid of 45CaCl2. The solution was removed every 30 s and replaced by fresh PSS at 37°C. Radioactivity in the solution was determined by scintillation counting. Results were expressed as fractional rate (R) of 45Ca efflux: Ri=QiQc+∑n=ilastQn where Qi = quantity of 45Ca2+ lost from the cells during time period i and Qc = quantity of 45Ca2+ in the cells at the end of the experiment. 45Ca2+ efflux was stimulated by addition of NT to the washing solution after eight medium changes. When the effects of antagonists were studied, they were present from the beginning of the experiment, i.e. for 4 min before the addition of NT. For concentration-effect relationships and inhibition experiments, 45Ca2+ efflux during the 1st min of stimulation was calculated by summation and corrected by subtracting base-line efflux. Data from several experiments were pooled and analyzed together by fitting the sigmoidal equation to the data by nonlinear regression thus determining EC50 values and their standard errors (23De Léan A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the program Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany). Confluent cell monolayers in 60-mm dishes were incubated for 72 h in normal culture medium containing 5 μCi/ml of [myo-3H]inositol. Medium was then aspirated, and the cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min with PSS containing 20 mM LiCl. Cells were then stimulated in the same medium with different concentrations of NT and antagonist for an additional 30 min at 37°C. At the end of the incubation period, buffer was aspirated, and the cells were extracted with an ice-cold 0.1 N methanol/HCl (50/50) solution for 30 min. Extracts were then neutralized with 1 M Na2CO3, and [3H]inositol monophosphate was separated as described by Berridge et al.(24Berridge M. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C. Heslop J.P. Irvine R. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar) using columns containing 1 ml of AG1-X8 resin. RNA was extracted from confluent HUVECs with the Glassmax RNA MicroIsolation kit (Life Technologies, Inc., Eragny, France) according to the manufacturer's procedure and quantified on a GeneQuant spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech Europe, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). RT-PCR was performed as described by Kawasaki(25Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 21-38Crossref Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg of RNA, using a SuperScript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) with oligo(dT) as a primer. Samples were then treated with 2 units of RNase H and amplified by 35 repeated cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2 min. The PCR reaction mixture (total volume 50 μl) contained 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France) with 10 pmol of the following primers: 5′-CAG GTC AAC ACC TTC ATG TC-3′ and 5′-ACT GCT CAT CCG AGA TGT AG-3′. These primers spanned a 269-bp portion of the NT cDNA between bases 1083 and 1352(26Vita N. Laurent P. Lefort S. Chalon P. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Gully D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Caput D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Blank (control) was carried out in the same conditions in samples in which RNA was omitted. Amplified products were subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel and visualized under UV light, after ethidium bromide staining. Resolved amplicons were then transferred overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Biodyne B, Pall, Saint Germain en Laye, France) in 0.4 N NaOH, and hybridization was performed as follows. The membrane was rinsed twice in 2 × sodium saline citrate buffer and soaked in 5 ml of hybridization buffer (1% gelatin, 0.5% casein, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1% Tween 20) in an hybridization incubator (model 400, Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvaley, CA) for 15 min, at 42°C. HRP-labeled oligonucleotide probe (100 ng) was added, and the incubation was carried out for 30 min at 42°C. The probe (5′-ACT GCT CAT CCG AGA TGT AG-3′) was designed to hybridize a sequence corresponding to bases 1222-1241 of the human NT receptor cDNA. It was coupled at the 5′ end with HRP according to the method of Bouaboula et al.(27Bouaboula M. Legoux P. Pésségué B. Delpech B. Dumont X. Piechaczyk M. Casellas P. Shire D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21830-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was rinsed twice in 10 ml of 0.1 × sodium saline citrate, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 42°C, and the hybridized probe was revealed with the ECL detection kit on hyperfilm HP films (Amersham Corp., Les Ulis, France). As shown in Fig. 1A, 125I-NT binding to HUVEC monolayers at 20°C was saturable, with a nonspecific binding representing less than 20% of total binding at all concentrations. The Scatchard plot (Fig. 1A, inset) was linear, indicative of a single class of non-interacting binding sites. From several experiments, the mean dissociation constant (Kd) was found to be of 0.23 ± 0.08 nM and the binding site density (Bmax) represented 5500 ± 1300 sites/cell (n = 3). Binding studies carried out at 37°C gave results which were identical to those from experiments performed at 20°C, with Kd = 0.40 ± 0.23 nM and Bmax = 5800 ± 1500 sites/cell (n = 2). Further experiments were therefore carried out at 20°C in order to study binding at NT affinities close to the physiological range while minimizing internalization and degradation of NT which is likely to occur at 37°C. At this temperature, NT binding sites could also be detected in HAECs, where Kd = 0.6 ± 0.26 nM and Bmax = 32,000 ± 1,700 sites/cell (n = 3, not shown). The kinetics of 125I-NT binding indicated that the association of 125I-NT (100 pM) was complete after 1 h of incubation and remained stable for up to 2 h. As shown in Fig. 1B, the mean data were well described by a monoexponential equation corresponding to a pseudo-first order association reaction, with kobs = 0.031 min-1 (t1/2 = 22 min). Dissociation of 125I-NT could be induced by either unlabeled NT or SR 48692, a specific non-peptide antagonist of high affinity NT receptors, and was identical in both cases (Fig. 1C). Dissociation was rapid, with a half-life of 33 min, corresponding to a dissociation rate constant (k−1) of 3.5 × 10-4 s−1. A small percentage of 125I-NT (around 20%) did not dissociate and remained associated to the cells even after 3 h of incubation. The association rate constant k+1 was found to be 1.6 × 106M−1 s−1. Calculating the dissociation constant Kd = k−1/k+1 gave a value of 0.22 nM, identical to the Kd value determined in equilibrium binding experiments. As shown in Fig. 2, NT and its analogues inhibited 125I-NT binding in a monophasic manner, slope factors being close to unity. As the concentration of 125I-NT used (100 pM) was less than half of the Kd value of NT, the concentrations of compounds giving 50% of inhibition of 125I-NT binding (K0.5) can be considered equal within experimental error to the affinities of the compounds for 125I-NT binding sites. The following rank order of potency was determined (K0.5± S.E. nM, n = 2-3): NT8-13 (0.11 ± 0.06), NT (0.35 ± 0.05), acetyl-NT8-13 (1.5 ± 0.7), [Phe11]NT (12 ± 5). [D-Tyr11]NT was inactive up to 10 μM. 125I-NT binding could also be inhibited by SR 48692, with a K0.5 value of 16 ± 4 nM. The rank order of potency of NT analogues and the inhibition by SR 48692 show that endothelial cell NT binding sites were very similar to rat brain NT receptors(21Gully D. Canton M. Boigegrain R. Jeanjean F. Poncelet M Gueudet C. Heaulme M. Brouard A. Pelaprat D. Labbé-Jullié C. Mazella J. Soubrié P. Maffrand J.P. Rostène W. Kitabgi P. Le Fur G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In rat and mouse brain, two different classes of 125I-NT binding sites have been distinguished using the antihistaminergic compound levocabastine which specifically inhibited 125I-NT binding to low affinity sites(28Schotte A. Leysen J.E. Laduron P.M. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1986; 333: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 29Mazella J. Chabry J. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 144-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in endothelial cell monolayers levocabastine had no effect on 125I-NT binding up to a concentration of 10 μM (not shown), suggesting that HUVEC NT receptors were of the high affinity type. The effect of several peptides, which, like NT, release histamine from mast cells, was assessed on 125I-NT binding to endothelial cells: neither substance P, nor bradykinin or other peptides like angiotensin II, vasoactive intestinal peptide, or corticotropin-releasing factor had any effect on 125I-NT binding to HUVECs at 10 μM (not shown). The presence of NT receptors in HUVECs was visualized after RT-PCR amplification of the NT receptor mRNA extracted from HUVECs which showed only one 269-bp single band after electrophoresis (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, this band was identified as a NT receptor mRNA-derived amplicon by Southern blotting, whereas no amplification products could be detected in the control samples. NT has been shown to increase phosphoinositide turnover and activate intracellular free Ca2+ release in HT29 colonic cancer cells (30Bozou J.C. Rochet N. Magnaldo I. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and rat NT receptor transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells(31Watson M.A. Yamada M. Yamada M. Cusack B. Veverka K. Bolden-Watson C. Richelson E. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1967-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas it increased cGMP levels and activated NO synthesis in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells(32Gilbert J.A. Richelson E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 99: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Amar S. Mazella J. Checler F. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 7-13PubMed Google Scholar). In HUVECs, we were unable to demonstrate an increase in cGMP levels induced by NT (3-100 nM), whereas the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μM) increased cGMP levels more than 5-fold from 0.28 to 1.6 pmol/106 cells (not shown). However, NT was able to modulate Ca2+ homeostasis in these cells. As shown in Fig. 4, NT induced a strong but transient increase in 45Ca2+ efflux in HUVEC monolayers which had been prelabeled with 45Ca2+ overnight. The maximal increase as well as the kinetics of 45Ca2+ efflux were dose-dependent. At high concentrations of NT, the maximal efflux was reached after 30 s of incubation, whereas at lower concentrations it took 1 min to attain the peak response (Fig. 4). As shown in the inset of Fig. 4, the concentration-effect relationship of NT was steep, with a threshold around 1 nM of NT, and a maximal effect was reached at 10 nM NT. This maximal effect represented a loss of around 15% of the total intracellular 45Ca2+ during 1 min of stimulation. To determine whether the functional effects of NT analogues were related to their potency as inhibitors of 125I-NT binding, these compounds were tested. As shown in Fig. 5, all NT analogues with the exception of the very low affinity compound [D-Tyr11]NT were able to induce 45Ca2+ efflux from HUVECs. The rank order of potency was identical to the order determined in binding experiments (EC50± S.E. nM, n = 4): NT8-13 (1.3 ± 0.23), NT (4 ± 1.5), acetyl-NT8-13 (10 ± 5), [Phe11]NT (90 ± 20). Levocabastine had no effect up to a concentration of 10 μM. A good correlation was obtained between binding data and the functional response of NT analogues (r = 0.997) with a slope value not very far from unity (0.88). This observation strongly suggested that the 125I-NT binding sites were involved in the activation of 45Ca2+ efflux in HUVECs. To further demonstrate the specificity of the stimulatory effect of NT, the effect of the antagonist SR 48692 on NT-induced 45Ca2+ release was determined. SR 48692 inhibited 45Ca2+ efflux with an IC50 value of 8 ± 1.2 nM, a value close to its IC50 value in binding experiments. NT has been shown to increase the turnover of phosphoinositide in HT29 cells(30Bozou J.C. Rochet N. Magnaldo I. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the effect of NT on 45Ca2+ efflux suggests that the peptide may also stimulate phosphoinositide turnover in endothelial cells. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 6, NT increased phosphatidyl turnover about 2-fold in a concentration range similar to that active in HT29 cells and identical to the concentrations increasing 45Ca2+ efflux in endothelial cells. Like for 45Ca2+ efflux, this effect of NT was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the antagonist SR 48692 (Fig. 6, inset).Figure 4:Effect of NT on 45Ca2+ efflux in HUVECs. 45Ca2+-labeled cell monolayers were washed every 30 s with PSS and 45Ca2+ in the washing solution determined by scintillation counting.

Up to now, NT binding sites have been reported only in brain and gastrointestinal smooth muscle tissues of different species. With the exception of the low affinity binding sites of rat brain, which were inhibited by levocabastine(28Schotte A. Leysen J.E. Laduron P.M. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1986; 333: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 29Mazella J. Chabry J. Kitabgi P. Vincent J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 144-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these binding sites appeared remarkably similar, with the same rank order of potency for different NT analogues. Only in mast cells could a different type of NT receptor exist: NT binding in these cells is inhibited by bradykinin at low concentrations(20Lazarus L.H. Perrin M.H. Brown M.R. Rivier J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7180-7183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but because of the low affinity of NT binding in these cells (Kd = 150 nM) it is not clear whether these binding sites are NT receptors or are representative of the interaction of NT with other membrane proteins (such as G-proteins) involved in the secretion of histamine(2Kitabgi P. Checler F. Mazella J. Vincent J.P. Rev. Clin. Basic Pharmacol. 1985; 5: 397-486PubMed Google Scholar). A similar remark applies to macrophage NT binding sites, which also bound substance P(35Bar-Shavit Z. Terry S. Blumberg S. Goldman R. Neuropeptides. 1982; 2: 325-335Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At the present time, three types of NT binding sites can be considered: the high affinity, brain-type NT receptor, the low affinity brain receptor and the low affinity mastocyte or macrophage NT binding sites. The NT binding sites on endothelial cells described in this study resemble the high affinity brain receptors by several different criteria: (i) a very high affinity for NT and a rank order of potency for NT analogues similar to the one observed in the rat brain, with NT8-13 significantly more active than NT and [Phe11]NT; (ii) no inhibition by levocabastine, differentiating it from low affinity brain sites; (iii) no inhibition by different histamine-releasing peptides such as bradykinin and substance P, unlike mastocyte binding sites; and (iv) a single-band hybridization of endothelial cell mRNA with a human brain NT receptor probe. Together, these results suggest that HUVECs express a NT receptor very similar to the high affinity type expressed in electrically excitable cells such as neurons and smooth muscle cells. Furthermore NT binding sites were found on aortic endothelial cells from adult humans, suggesting that these NT receptors are not an idiosyncrasy of fetal endothelial cells from umbilical vein, but are a common feature of endothelial cells of human origin. The NT binding sites in endothelial cells were functionally coupled to intracellular Ca2+ release, and different NT analogues acted as agonists with the same rank order of potency as that observed in binding experiments. However, although the K0.5 values determined in binding experiments and the EC50 values from 45Ca2+ efflux experiments were closely correlated, EC50 values were about 10-fold higher than the K0.5 values. A similar discrepancy has already been observed in HT29 cells, where the IC50 value of NT for stimulation of 45Ca2+ efflux was 2 nM, whereas the dissociation constant of NT in binding experiments was 0.27 nM(30Bozou J.C. Rochet N. Magnaldo I. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As in HT29 cells, this was probably due to the short incubation times used in 45Ca2+ efflux experiments compared to those used in the binding studies. NT stimulated phosphoinositide turnover in HUVECs, suggesting that the effect on 45Ca2+ efflux was a consequence of the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and subsequent stimulation of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Thus, results from binding studies and second messenger determinations show that HUVECs express functional NT receptors which are coupled to phosphoinositide turnover and intracellular Ca2+ release. These receptors are blocked by SR 48692 at low nanomolar concentrations, allowing this compound to be used to probe the role of these receptors in vitro as well as in vivo. This is a relevant problem because, up to now, the vascular effects of NT injection, in particular hypotension and increase in membrane permeability, have essentially been attributed to an indirect action through release of histamine from mastocytes or interaction with innervating terminations. The detection of functional NT binding sites in HUVECs raises the possibility of a direct action of NT on endothelial cells of the cardiovascular system. Possible consequences of endothelial NT receptor activation could be (i) the release of vasorelaxating substances such as NO and (ii) the increase of vascular endothelial permeability. Increases on intracellular free Ca2+, implicated both in the release of NO from endothelial cells (36He P. Pagakis S.N. Curry F.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H1366-H1374PubMed Google Scholar) and in the changes of endothelial monolayer permeability induced by different compounds(37Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar), strengthen this hypothesis."
