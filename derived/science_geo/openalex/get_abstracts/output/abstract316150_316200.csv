https://openalex.org/W2085982749,"Branching valley networks throughout the heavily cratered terrain of Mars exhibit no compelling evidence for formation by rainfall-fed erosion. The networks are diffuse and inefficient, with irregular tributary junction angles and large, undissected intervalley areas. Rather, the deeply entrenched canyons, with blunt amphitheater terminations, cliff-bench wall topography, lack of evidence of interior erosion by flow, and clear structural control, suggest headward extension by basal sapping. The size-frequency distributions of impact craters in these valleys and in the heavily cratered terrain that surrounds them are statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that valley formation has not occurred on Mars for billions of years."

A negative correlation between the proportion of the crop removed and mean seed size explains 59 percent of the variance in removal, suggesting that birds minimize ingestion of useless bulk."
https://openalex.org/W2088578214,"Larvae of the fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria), a polyphagous defoliator of canopy trees, hatch at the time of budbreak of scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), about 10 days before budbreak of white oak (Quercus alba). Thus the Alsophila population was dense in a site dominated by scarlet oaks and defoliated the scattered white oaks when they came into leaf. In a site dominated by white oaks, the Alsophila population was sparse and chiefly attacked scattered scarlet oak. Thus in each stand, the rarer species of tree suffered greater herbivory, in contrast to the more commonly reported observation that herbivore attack on a plant species increases with density."

In contrast to benign tumor cells, which remain restricted to their site of origin, malignant cells have the ability to infiltrate adjacent tissues and thus become locally disseminated. Furthermore, their capacity for invasiveness allows them to penetrate into the lumina of lymphatic and blood vessels, whereby they are transported to more distant parts. It was thought that physical and chemical differences must exist between benign and malignant neoplastic cells which permit the former to remain localized and the latter to permeate adjacent normal tissues. Under the assumption that these differences between the types of cells were ascertainable by experimental methods, a series of investigations was made.'"

Only one isotope, calcium-41, appears to be suitable from the dual stand-points of reliable nuclear physics and manageable backgrounds. The proposed measurement also may be interesting in view of recent evidence for neutrino oscillations."

https://openalex.org/W2055288621,"Abstract Analyses by combustion of rubber hydrocarbon separated from rubber latex and crystallized from ethereal solutions at low temperatures yielded combined percentages of carbon and hydrogen which totaled slightly less than 100. Midgley, Henne, Shepard and Renoll assumed the difference to be due to oxygen, and they have used the results to substantiate their argument that natural rubber is not a true hydrocarbon but contains a small amount of oxygen in chemical combination. Later, Roberts reported that he had isolated the portion of rubber which contained oxygen. This he called caoutchol to distinguish it from the hydrocarbon, which he named caoutchene. He used Midgley's results to confirm his findings, which he attempted to apply in a new way to the familiar two-phase theory of Fessenden as an explanation of the properties of rubber. However, Schidrowitz has indicated that the method used by Roberts to separate the caoutchol is not free from possible criticism. Some steps in the procedure, e.g., mill..."
