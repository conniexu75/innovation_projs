https://openalex.org/W2040739363,"Although individual neurons in the arm area of the primate motor cortex are only broadly tuned to a particular direction in three-dimensional space, the animal can very precisely control the movement of its arm. The direction of movement was found to be uniquely predicted by the action of a population of motor cortical neurons. When individual cells were represented as vectors that make weighted contributions along the axis of their preferred direction (according to changes in their activity during the movement under consideration) the resulting vector sum of all cell vectors (population vector) was in a direction congruent with the direction of movement. This population vector can be monitored during various tasks, and similar measures in other neuronal populations could be of heuristic value where there is a neural representation of variables with vectorial attributes."

https://openalex.org/W2065785294,"The mechanism by which the estrogen receptor and other steroid hormone receptors regulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells is not well understood. In this study, a complementary DNA clone containing the entire translated portion of the messenger RNA for the estrogen receptor from MCF-7 human breast cancer cells was sequenced and then expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells to give a functional protein. An open reading frame of 1785 nucleotides in the complementary DNA corresponded to a polypeptide of 595 amino acids and a molecular weight of 66,200, which is in good agreement with published molecular weight values of 65,000 to 70,000 for the estrogen receptor. Homogenates of transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells containing a protein that bound [3H]estradiol and sedimented as a 4S complex in salt-containing sucrose gradients and as an 8 to 9S complex in the absence of salt. Interaction of this receptor-[3H]estradiol complex with a monoclonal antibody that is specific for primate ER confirms the identity of the expressed complementary DNA as human estrogen receptor. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed significant regional homology among the human estrogen receptor, the human glucocorticoid receptor, and the putative v-erbA oncogene product. This suggests that steroid receptor genes and the avian erythroblastosis viral oncogene are derived from a common primordial gene. The homologous region, which is rich in cysteine, lysine, and arginine, may represent the DNA-binding domain of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2080383392,"The relation between health and a sense of control may grow stronger in old age. This could occur through three types of processes: experiences particularly relevant to control may increase markedly in old age; the association between control and some aspect of health may be altered by age; and age may influence the association between control and health-related behaviors or the seeking of medical care. Studies show that there are detrimental effects on the health of older people when their control of their activities is restricted; in contrast, interventions that enhance options for control by nursing home patients promote health. With increasing age, however, variability in preferred amounts of control also increases, and sometimes greater control over activities, circumstances, or health has negative consequences including stress, worry, and self-blame. Mechanisms mediating the control-health relation include feelings of stress, symptom labeling, changes in the neuroendocrine and immune systems, and behavior relevant to health maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2016773845,"Cholinergic agonists rapidly and transiently induced transcription of the c-fos protooncogene and one or more actin genes in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells. Transcription was activated within minutes after stimulation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and required an influx of extracellular Ca2+ ions through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Nicotine activation proceeded by a different pathway from activation by nerve growth factor, whose stimulation of these genes is independent of extracellular Ca2+ ions. These findings suggest that neurotransmitters may rapidly activate specific gene transcription in nondividing neuronally differentiated cells. They also suggest a functional role for neurotransmitter induction of c-fos and actin expression in the nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1969695222,"Previous studies have shown that the development of the vulva of the C. elegans hermaphrodite involves six multipotential hypodermal cells as well as the gonadal anchor cell, which induces vulval formation. Our further examination of the interactions among these seven cells has led to the following model. Each hypodermal precursor cell becomes determined to adopt one of its three potential fates; each of these fates is to generate a particular cell lineage. In the absence of cellular interactions each precursor cell will generate the nonvulval cell lineage; an inductive signal from the anchor cell is required for a precursor cell to generate either of the two types of vulval cell lineages. The inductive signal is spatially graded, and the potency of the signal specifies which lineage is expressed by each of the tripotential precursor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2140350144,"Prenatal exposure to alcohol produces many developmental defects of the central nervous system, such as microcephaly, mental retardation, motor dysfunction, and cognitive deficiencies. Therefore, the generation of neurons in the cerebral cortex was examined in the offspring of female rats fed a diet containing ethanol. Prenatal exposure to ethanol delayed and extended the period during which cortical neurons were generated, reduced the number of neurons in the nature cortex with the same time of origin, and altered the distribution of neurons generated on a particular day. Thus, the proliferation and migration of cortical neurons are profoundly affected by in utero exposure to ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W2104195358,"By chromosome walking in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the BALB/c mouse, we have linked the K region to the I region at the molecular level. Forty-nine overlapping cosmid clones define a stretch of about 600 kb of DNA containing 2 class I and 7 class II genes. Eleven independent recombination events were mapped between the K and the I region marker loci by Southern blot analysis of polymorphic restriction sites. Eight of these events involved crossing-over, at an unusually high frequency of 0.6%-1.5% between genes from Mus musculus castaneus and laboratory mouse strains, and they were confined to two small stretches of DNA. We conclude that recombination hotspots are present at these positions in the two M.m. castaneus MHC haplotypes tested. In contrast, several MHC haplotypes of laboratory mice appear to lack those hotspots."

The peptide exhibits sequence homology with the hormonally active portion of the vertebrate hormones human gastrin II and cholecystokinin, suggesting that these peptides are evolutionarily related. Six of the 11 amino acid residues (55 percent) are identical to those in gastrin II. In addition, the intestinal myotropic action of leucosulfakinin is analogous to that of gastrin."

https://openalex.org/W1481710938,"The tissue distribution and the structural heterogeneity of the rat angiotensinogen mRNA have been investigated with the aid of a previously cloned cDNA as well as a genomic DNA for rat angiotensinogen as analytical probes. The angiotensinogen mRNA is expressed not only in the liver but also in various tissues including the brain, kidney, adrenal gland, ovary, and lung. The relative levels of the mRNA in the above tissues have been estimated to be 3-4, 20-30 (for the next three tissues), and around 100 times less than that in the liver, respectively. The mRNAs in both hepatic and extrahepatic tissues are encoded by a single gene in the rat genome. At least four different size classes of the angiotensinogen mRNA that start with a single 5' terminus and differ only in the lengths of their 3'-untranslated regions have been identified, and these multiple mRNA species are most likely generated by using the polyadenylation signals AAUAAA and AUUAAA found 10-30 nucleotides upstream from the four polyadenylation sites. Because the structures of these multiple mRNA species do not vary among the tissues of the liver, brain, and kidney, angiotensinogen synthesized locally is structurally identical to that produced in the liver and may have some biological roles independent of the circulating angiotensinogen, mainly derived from the liver. In addition, the sequence of the 5'-flanking region of the angiotensinogen gene has been determined, and some features common to other steroid hormone-responsive genes have been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2018464869,"The human asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 is anchored in the membrane by a single stretch of 20 hydrophobic amino acids; the hydrophilic amino terminus faces the cytoplasm, and the carboxyl terminus is exoplasmic. We show here that glycosylation and insertion of the asialoglycoprotein receptor into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is cotranslational and SRP-dependent and occurs without proteolytic cleavage. The membrane-anchor domain is necessary for membrane insertion, since a receptor with the segment deleted is neither inserted nor glycosylated. The segment is also sufficient for membrane insertion, since it will initiate translocation of a carboxy-terminal domain of rat alpha-tubulin across the membrane. We propose that a helical hairpin mechanism of membrane insertion is used both by cleaved amino-terminal and uncleaved internal signal sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2171452578,"There is a remarkable difference in the isozyme pattern between cardiac and hepatic glutathione S-transferases in rat (Ishikawa, T., and Sies, H. (1984) FEBS Lett. 169, 156-160), and one near-neutral isozyme (pI = 6.9) of the cardiac glutathione S-transferases was found to have a significantly high activity toward 4-hydroxynonenal. The isozyme was inhibited by the resulting glutathione S-conjugate of 4-hydroxynonenal competitively with GSH and noncompetitively with 4-hydroxynonenal. The kinetic parameters estimated for the isozyme were: kcat = 460 mol X min-1 X mol enzyme-1, Km = 50 microM for 4-hydroxynonenal, Ki = 85 microM. When the heart was perfused with 4-hydroxynonenal, a marked decrease was observed in the intracellular GSH level, accompanied by an increase of glutathione S-conjugate of 4-hydroxynonenal in the heart. The rate of the conjugation reaction was more than 30 times the rate of the spontaneous reaction, the half-life of 4-hydroxynonenal in the heart being less than 4 s. The glutathione S-conjugate of 4-hydroxynonenal was released from the heart into the perfusion medium. Saturation kinetics were observed for the release with respect to the intracellular level of the S-conjugate (Vmax = 12 nmol X min-1 X g heart-1), and there was a competition by the S-conjugate for GSSG release. The release of the glutathione S-conjugate is considered as a carrier-mediated process and to be important not only in interorgan glutathione metabolism but also in diminishing the inhibitory effect of the S-conjugate on glutathione S-transferases and glutathione reductase."
https://openalex.org/W2020334774,"The mouse t haplotypes show defects in spermatogenesis attributed to multiple loci on chromosome 17. We have cloned the gene for an abundant testicular germ cell protein, t complex polypeptide 1, which has a variant form in t haplotypes, TCP-1A. A cDNA clone, pB1.4, which hybridizes to a 19S mRNA that is abundant in haploid cells during mouse spermatogenesis, derives from the 3' end of the mRNA encoding TCP-1B. The Tcp-1 gene appears to be a member of a novel gene family and shows multiple changes between the predicted amino acid sequences of TCP-1B and TCP-1A. An additional Taq1 site is created by a T to C transition in the predicted open reading frame of the Tcp-1a gene. The resultant RFLP has allowed typing of the Tcp-1 gene cluster in 54 complete and partial t haplotype chromosomes. DNA sequence comparison of the Tcp-1 genes suggests that the t haplotype chromosome arose within the genus Mus more than one million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2041520470,"The role of divergent primary sequences in restricting tubulin function was tested in vivo by a gene transfection experiment. A chicken-yeast chimeric β-tubulin DNA was introduced into 3T3 cells using the transfection vector pSV2. The 5′ end of this gene, from chicken, is similar but not identical with that of mouse β-tubulins; the 3′ end, from yeast, contains a carboxyl terminus that is very different from other known β-tubulin sequences. The chimeric protein is incorporated efficiently into each of the microtubule structures and each of the microtubules in the host cells. The presence of the protein has no apparent effect on either growth rate or cell morphology. The results suggest that the divergent sequences in this chimeric tubulin molecule place no restrictions on its activities in mouse cells."
https://openalex.org/W1976443173,"Defective-interfering (DI) genomes of a virus contain sequence information essential for their replication and packaging. They need not contain any coding information and therefore are a valuable tool for identifying cis-acting, regulatory sequences in a viral genome. To identify these sequences in a DI genome of Sindbis virus, we cloned a cDNA copy of a complete DI genome directly downstream of the promoter for the SP6 bacteriophage DNA dependent RNA polymerase. The cDNA was transcribed into RNA, which was transfected into chicken embryo fibroblasts in the presence of helper Sindbis virus. After one to two passages the DI RNA became the major viral RNA species in infected cells. Data from a series of deletions covering the entire DI genome show that only sequences in the 162 nucleotide region at the 5′ terminus and in the 19 nucleotide region at the 3′ terminus are specifically required for replication and packaging of these genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2031673898,"DNA bending has been suggested to play a role in the regulation of gene expression, initiation of DNA replication, DNA packaging, and the recognition of specific DNA sequences by proteins. It has recently been demonstrated that DNA bending can be sequence-directed. Bent DNA has also been observed as a consequence of sequence-specific binding of proteins to DNA. In this report DNA of plasmid pT181 is shown to contain a bend at the replication origin. Furthermore, this bend is enhanced by the binding of the pT181 replication initiator protein, RepC, to the origin."

https://openalex.org/W1522428977,"The hydrolysis of small unilamellar vesicles made of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcoline by pancreatic phospholipase A2 has been studied under various conditions of temperature and enzyme and substrate concentration using the following three different experimental protocols. When the enzyme was added to the substrate vesicles after being separately adjusted to the temperature of the experiments hydrolysis occurred instantaneously only in the temperature range where the lipid is known to exist in its gel phase, while above the transition range no hydrolysis occurred. Within the transition range, the time course of hydrolysis was characterized by initial very slow rate of hydrolysis (latency phase) followed by an abrupt increase in the rate after a time tau, which is a complex function of temperature and enzyme to substrate ratio. When an enzyme-substrate mixture was first preincubated below Tm and then temperature jumped to a temperature above or within the transition range, the latency phase was markedly shortened. When the temperature jump was to the transition range, this effect is observed even if Ca2+ is absent in the preincubation mixture. However, instantaneous hydrolysis was observed upon temperature jumping the mixture to a temperature high above Tm only if Ca2+ was present in the preincubation medium. In temperature-scanning experiments, hydrolysis was followed while changing the temperature of the enzyme-substrate mixture continuously. Heating an enzyme-substrate mixture from room temperature resulted in an abrupt onset of hydrolysis when the transition range was approached. These results lead us to conclude that two distinctly different steps precede rapid hydrolysis of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine small unilamellar vesicles by pancreatic phospholipase A2: a Ca2+-independent binding of the enzyme to the substrate vesicles, which for chemically pure bilayers occurs best in the gel phase. This step is followed by a Ca2+-dependent activation of the initially formed enzyme-substrate complex. The latter step only occurs under conditions where the bilayer possesses packing irregularities and probably involves a reorganization of the enzyme-substrate complex. At least one of these two steps appears to involve enzyme-enzyme interaction."

https://openalex.org/W1531847600,"The conversion of prothrombin into thrombin by Factor Xa requires the cleavage of two peptide bonds in prothrombin. Dependent on the order of cleavage, prethrombin 2 or meizothrombin occurs as intermediate. Since prethrombin 2 has as yet been the only observed intermediate, prothrombin activation is generally considered to proceed via prethrombin 2. In this paper we present new methods that allow differentiation between meizothrombin and thrombin formed during the initial phase of prothrombin activation. These methods, which make use of the different reactivities of meizothrombin and thrombin toward fibrinogen and antithrombin III plus heparin, enabled us to show the generation of considerable amounts of meizothrombin during Factor Xa-catalyzed prothrombin activation. Both meizothrombin and thrombin incorporated the active site-directed fluorescent chloromethyl ketone 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-CH2Cl. Gel electrophoretic analysis of chloromethyl ketone-treated aliquots of prothrombin activation mixtures confirmed meizothrombin formation. These observations demonstrate that prothrombin may also be converted into thrombin via meizothrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1528330141,"A cell line derived from pig kidney, LLC-PK1, was grown in a culture system in which the cells express morphological and biochemical characteristics of the proximal tubule. This model was used to investigate the mechanism of S-cysteine conjugate toxicity and the role of glutathione conjugate metabolism. LLC-PK1 cells have the degradative enzymes of the mercapturate pathway, and S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine and S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-glutathione are toxic. S-(1,2-Dichlorovinyl)-L-glutathione is not toxic when the cells are pretreated with AT-125, an inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The cells respond to a variety of toxic cysteine conjugates. Cysteine conjugate beta-lyase activity is not detectable by standard assays, but can be measured using radiolabeled S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine. Pyruvate stimulates the beta-elimination reaction with S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine as substrate 2-3-fold. The data suggest that a side transamination reaction regulates the flux of substrate through the beta-elimination pathway; therefore, cysteine conjugate beta-lyase in LLC-PK1 cells may be regulated by transamination, and measurement of lyase activity in some systems may require the presence of alpha-ketoacids. Aminoxyacetic acid blocks both the metabolism of S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine to a reactive species which covalently binds to cellular macromolecules and toxicity. Glutathione inhibits the binding of the sulfur containing cleavage fragment to acid insoluble material in vitro. The data provide direct evidence that S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine is metabolized to a reactive species which covalently binds to cellular macromolecules, and the binding is proportional to toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2069142867,"Contraction and myosin light-chain phosphorylation were measured in electrically stimulated tracheal smooth muscle. Latencies for the onset of force, stiffness, and light-chain phosphorylation were 500 milliseconds. Myosin light chain was phosphorylated from 0.04 to 0.80 mole of phosphate per mole of light chain with a pseudo-first-order rate of 1.1 per second with no evidence of an ordered or negatively cooperative process. Following the period of latency, stiffness increased with phosphorylation and both increased more rapidly than isometric force. The linear relation between stiffness and phosphorylation during activation suggests independent attachment of each myosin head upon phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1492098985,"The actions of insulin and somatomedin C (insulin-like growth factor I) on cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity and the synthesis of cytochrome P-450scc and adrenodoxin were investigated in primary cultures of swine ovarian (granulosa) cells. Nanomolar concentrations of pure human somatomedin C stimulated biosynthesis of progesterone and 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one. Moreover, in the presence of exogenous sterol substrate for cholesterol side-chain cleavage, somatomedin C significantly enhanced pregnenolone biosynthesis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This augmentation of functional cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity was accompanied by a dose-dependent (2-16-fold) increase in [35S]methionine incorporation into specific immunoprecipitable cytochrome P-450scc and adrenodoxin. Micromolar concentrations of insulin (but not proinsulin or desoctapeptide) also induced synthesis of cholesterol side-chain cleavage constituents by 4-7-fold. These results demonstrate that an insulin-like growth factor, somatomedin C, exerts discrete differentiating effects on ovarian cells characterized by increased synthesis of immunospecific cytochrome P-450scc and adrenodoxin. Thus, we infer that somatomedin C may serve a critical role in the differentiation of steroidogenic cells in the mammalian ovary."
https://openalex.org/W1545659699,"The N-linked oligosaccharides found on the lysosomal enzymes from Dictyostelium discoideum are highly sulfated and contain methylphosphomannosyl residues (Gabel, C. A., Costello, C. E., Reinhold, V. N., Kurtz, L., and Kornfeld, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13762-13769). Here we report studies done on the structure of N-linked oligosaccharides found on proteins secreted during growth, a major portion of which are lysosomal enzymes. Cells were metabolically labeled with [2-3H]Man and 35SO4 and a portion of the oligosaccharides were released by a sequential digestion with endoglycosidase H followed by endoglycosidase/peptide N-glycosidase F preparations. The oligosaccharides were separated by anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography into fractions containing from one up to six negative charges. Some of the oligosaccharides contained only sulfate esters or phosphodiesters, but most contained both. Less than 2% of the oligosaccharides contained a phosphomonoester or an acid-sensitive phosphodiester typical of the mammalian lysosomal enzymes. A combination of acid and base hydrolysis suggested that most of the sulfate esters were linked to primary hydroxyl groups. The presence of Man-6-SO4 was demonstrated by the appearance of 3,6-anhydromannose in acid hydrolysates of base-treated, reduced oligosaccharides. These residues were not detected in acid hydrolysates without prior base treatment or in oligosaccharides first treated by solvolysis to remove sulfate esters. Based on high performance liquid chromatography quantitation of percentage of 3H label found in 3,6-anhydromannose, it is likely that Man-6-SO4 accounts for the majority of the sulfated sugars in the oligosaccharides released from the secreted glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2135941421,"Ivermectin, given to onchocerciasis patients as a single oral dose of 200 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, substantially reduced the uptake of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae by Simulium yahense, an efficient black fly vector of the parasite in the tropical rain forests of West Africa. Three months after treatment, patients given ivermectin infected flies at a significantly lower rate than those who had received diethylcarbamazine or placebo, thereby reducing the number of developing larvae in the vector population. This diminished rate of infectiousness was also evident 6 months after treatment. These results strongly suggest that ivermectin could be effective in interrupting transmission of Onchocerca volvulus for epidemiologically important periods of time."
https://openalex.org/W21786988,"When fasted rats ate regular lab chow there was a lag time of about 2 h before the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) in liver began to rise from its low basal level. By contrast, in animals refed on a sucrose-based diet hepatic [Fru-2,6-P2] increased 20-fold (to a value of approximately 12 nmol/g wet weight) during the first hour. These responses correlated with differences in the ability of the two diets to increase the circulating [insulin]/[glucagon] ratio and thus to elevate the ratio of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase to fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase. Liver glycogen was deposited briskly in both groups of rats. To assess its mechanism of synthesis (directly from glucose versus indirectly via the gluconeogenic pathway), animals eating the chow or sucrose diets received intravenous infusions of [14C]bicarbonate, [1-14C] fructose, and 3H2O. After isolation, the glycogen was subjected to positional isotopic analysis of its glucose residues. The results established that regardless of the diet the bulk of liver glycogen was gluconeogenic in origin. The fact that with sucrose feeding carbon flow through hepatic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase remained active despite high levels of Fru-2,6-P2 (a potent inhibitor of this enzyme in vitro) presents a metabolic paradox. Conceivably, the suppressive effect of Fru-2, 6-P2 on hepatic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is overridden in vivo by some unknown factor or factors generated in response to sucrose feeding. Alternatively, metabolic zonation in liver might result in the coexistence of hepatocytes rich in Fru-2,6-P2 (high glycolytic, low gluconeogenic, low glycogenic capacitites) with cells depleted of Fru-2,6-P2 (low glycolytic, high gluconeogenic, high glycogenic capacities)."

https://openalex.org/W1530358569,"From skin of Xenopus laevis, cDNA libraries were constructed and clones coding for the precursors of caerulein were isolated and sequenced. Using restriction endonuclease digestions, three different types of preprocaerulein cDNAs could be discerned. These were termed types I, III, and IV in accordance with the number of caerulein copies present in the sequence, the type III being the most abundant one. An incomplete copy of a fourth variant, termed type I', was also found. Besides deletions/insertions encompassing one or two caerulein sequences, these types also differ from each other by several point mutations. In the homologous precursor polypeptides deduced from the nucleotide sequence of these cloned cDNAs, the caerulein copies are flanked by complex processing sequences. These are Arg-Arg-Phe-Ala-Asp-Gly or Arg-Arg-Asp-Gly at the amino-terminal side and Gly-Arg-Arg at the carboxyl end. Between caerulein copies, highly homologous segments are present both at the polypeptide and cDNA level. This homology is evident both within a given precursor, where up to three such segments are present, and between the different types of precursors. We conclude that preprocaerulein cDNAs in the skin of X. laevis represent a small family, at least part of which is derived from different genes rather than being formed by alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2054628600,"The cyclosporines are a family of cyclic endecapeptides that cause a profound suppression of primary immune stimulation both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, the regulatory protein calmodulin (CaM) has been implicated as a target for cyclosporin A (CsA) binding. This study utilized two less-active isomers of CsA to evaluate the specificity and biological significance of CaM binding. The three cyclosporines exhibited equivalent in vitro binding to CaM, regardless of immunosuppressive activity. Furthermore, CaM-dependent enzyme systems were inhibited equally by active and inactive cyclosporines, but only at concentrations 100 times those necessary to block lymphocyte activation. Thus the exquisite immunosuppressive stereospecificity displayed by cyclosporine isomers is not reflected in the binding to and inhibition of CaM, suggesting that inhibition of CaM-dependent processes is not sufficient to explain the immunosuppressive activity of CsA."

https://openalex.org/W1485262685,"Three species of aldolase A mRNA (mRNAs I, II, and III) only differing in the structure of the 5'-terminal noncoding region were detected in rat tissues. The cDNA clones for mRNAs II and III were prepared from ascites hepatoma AH60C and sequenced. The mRNA II is 1393 nucleotides long excluding poly(A) tail, while the mRNA III is 1440 nucleotides long, some 50 nucleotides longer than the mRNA II. The mRNAs II and III differ in the sequence between -25 and the 5' termini from the previously reported skeletal muscle aldolase A mRNA (mRNA I, 1343 nucleotides long). By contrast, the residual 5' noncoding sequence (-24 to -1) and the coding and 3' noncoding sequences are common to all the mRNAs. By dot spot hybridization and S1 mapping the distribution of these mRNAs in the various tissues was determined. The mRNA I appears exclusively in a skeletal muscle and some in heart and hepatoma AH60C, whereas the mRNAs II and III appear more or less in all the tissues examined, implying that their appearances are under tissue-specific control. Furthermore, partial nucleotide sequence analysis of the fetal liver aldolase A mRNA supports that aldolase A mRNA that reappeared in hepatoma is really a resurgence of the gene product expressed in the fetus."

Together, these clones contain 2078 nucleotides complementary to rat liver malic enzyme mRNA. The single open reading frame of 1761 nucleotides codes for a 585-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of about 65,460 daltons. The cloned cDNAs contain the complete 3‘-noncoding region of 301 nucleotides for the major mRNA species of rat liver and 16 nucleotides of the 5‘-noncoding region. Amino acid sequences of seven tryptic peptides (67 amino acids) from the purified protein are distributed through the single open reading frame and show excellent correspondence with the translated nucleotide sequence. The putative NADP-binding site for malic enzyme was identified by amino acid sequence homology with the NADP-binding site of the enoyl reductase domain of fatty acid synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W2011001507,"The potential utility of cultured neuroblastoma cells as donor tissue for neutral implants into the mammalian brain has been examined. Cells from a human neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32, were labeled with [3H]thymidine and chemically rendered amitotic. These differentiated IMR-32 cells were grafted into the hippocampi of five adult African Green monkeys, and graft survival was evaluated for up to 270 days after transplantation. Autoradiographically labeled grafted cells were identified in four animals. Processes from grafted cells could be followed for distances of up to 150 micrometers into the host brain. No evidence for neoplastic growth of the transplant was found. Thus, grafted neuroblastoma cells can survive for prolonged periods in the primate brain and may serve as a practical source of donor tissue for neural implants."
https://openalex.org/W2092385677,"The path of an object in apparent motion depends on correspondence matching, the decision that images seen at different places and at different times represent the same object. One determinant of correspondence is proximity. Still debated, however, is whether proximity is defined in a two- or three-dimensional spatial representation. Observers judged the motion path taken by an object with two neighbors of different apparent depth. Given similar two-dimensional distances, objects moved toward the neighbor of the same apparent depth. This is evidence that correspondence operates in a three-dimensional spatial representation."
https://openalex.org/W1507836923,"A basic lectin (pI approximately 10.0) was purified to homogeneity from the seeds of winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) by affinity chromatography on Sepharose 6-aminocaproyl-D-galactosamine. The lectin agglutinated trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes and had a relative molecular mass of 58,000 consisting of two subunits of Mr 29,000. The lectin binds to N-dansylgalactosamine, leading to a 15-fold increase in dansyl fluorescence with a concomitant 25-nm blue shift in the emission maximum. The lectin has two binding sites/dimer for this sugar and an association constant of 4.17 X 10(5) M-1 at 25 degrees C. The strong binding to N-dansylgalactosamine is due to a relatively positive entropic contribution as revealed by the thermodynamic parameters: delta H = -33.62 kJ mol-1 and delta S0 = -5.24 J mol-1 K-1. Binding of this sugar to the lectin shows that it can accommodate a large hydrophobic substituent on the C-2 carbon of D-galactose. Studies with other sugars indicate that a hydrophobic substituent in alpha- conformation at the anomeric position increases the affinity of binding. The C-4 and C-6 hydroxyl groups are critical for sugar binding to this lectin. Lectin difference absorption spectra in the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine indicate perturbation of tryptophan residues on sugar binding. The results of stopped flow kinetics with N- dansylgalactosamine and the lectin are consistent with a simple one- step mechanism for which k+1 = 1.33 X 10(4) M-1 s-1 and k-1 = 3.2 X 10(- 2) s-1 at 25 degrees C. This k-1 is slower than any reported for a lectin-monosaccharide complex so far. The activation parameters indicate an enthalpically controlled association process."
https://openalex.org/W1573109413,"The rate at which reducing equivalents equilibrate among the several oxidation-reduction active sites in xanthine oxidase has been investigated using a pH-jump technique in which partially reduced enzyme in dilute buffer is mixed with concentrated anaerobic buffer at a different pH in a conventional stopped flow apparatus. It is found that the rate constant associated with the observed spectral change varies with pH, doubling from 155 s-1 at pH 6 to 330 s-1 at pH 8.5, but is always found to be approximately 10-fold greater than kcat at the same pH. The observation of fast rates for the equilibration of reducing equivalents within xanthine oxidase is consistent with a great deal of indirect evidence from conventional kinetic studies of both the oxidative and reductive half-reactions of xanthine oxidase and lends support to the rapid equilibrium model that has been proposed for the oxidation-reduction interactions of the several centers in xanthine oxidase (Olson, J. S., Ballou, D. P., Palmer, G., and Massey, V. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4363-4382). The present conclusions are in conflict, however, with the interpretation of recent flash photolysis experiments with xanthine oxidase (Battacharyya, A., Tollin, G., Davis, M. D., and Edmondson, D. E. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 5270-5279). Possible sources for the apparent inconsistencies between the flash photolysis results and those of the present experiments are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1551324371,"Rat lung tissue was labeled with [35S]methionine and the major surfactant-associated proteins immunoprecipitated using a specific antiserum. The protein pattern obtained was very similar to that seen in rat bronchoalveolar lavage. Rat lung mRNA was subsequently translated in an in vitro rabbit reticulocyte system, and surfactant-associated protein-related polypeptides were immunoprecipitated. A 26-kDa polypeptide was identified and characterized as follows. (a) Unlabeled surfactant proteins added to the immunoprecipitation mixture completely inhibited its immunoprecipitation. (b) Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the 26-kDa protein resolved it into 3 isoforms. (c) Inclusion of dog pancreatic microsomes in the translation mixture resulted in the formation of two distinct higher molecular weight groups of isoforms, suggesting that the 26-kDa protein is destined to become a glycoprotein. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled rat lung tissue proteins after tunicamycin treatment resulted in 3 isoforms, identical to the ones seen in the primary translation products. In addition, expression of the surfactant proteins appears specific to the lung."
https://openalex.org/W1599778268,"Antipeptide antibodies directed to two amino acid sequences predicted from the cDNA encoding the insulin proreceptor have been used to study the relationship between the human receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). An antibody directed to a cytoplasmic domain near the membrane spanning region of the proreceptor inhibited the protein tyrosine kinase activity of both receptors whereas an antibody directed to the C terminus of the insulin receptor showed no cross-reactivity with the IGF-I receptor. The results establish that the cloned cDNA from the human placenta encodes the insulin receptor and not the closely related IGF-I receptor, that the IGF-I and insulin receptors share a specific amino acid sequence necessary for the expression of enzymatic activity, and that the C terminus of the insulin receptor is not conserved in the IGF-I receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1893951013,"Selectivity of catechol O-methyltransferase has been examined for the three ring-fluorinated norepinephrines to elucidate the role of acidity of the phenolic groups in their methylation. Substitution of fluorine at the 5-position of norepinephrine reverses the selectivity of catechol O-methyltransferase so that p-O-methylation predominates. The 5-fluoro substituent also causes the pKa of the p-hydroxyl group to decrease substantially. In contrast, 2- and 6-fluoronorepinephrines are methylated predominantly at the m-hydroxyl group. These results suggest that acidity of a phenolic group can play an important role in its ability to be methylated by catechol O-methyltransferase. Percentages of p-O-methylation of norepinephrine and its fluorinated derivatives increase with pH. This relative increase in p-O-methylation appears to accompany ionization of a group with pKa of 8.6, 7.7, 7.9, and 8.4 for norepinephrine and its 2-, 5-, and 6-fluoro derivative, respectively. These pKa values are the same as or similar to the pKa values of a phenolic hydroxyl group of these substrates. 3,4-Dihydroxybenzyl alcohol and its 5-fluoro derivative are O-methylated by catechol O-methyltransferase to form p- and m-O-methyl products in approximately 1:1 and 4:1 ratios, respectively, at all pH values. Based on the above results, a catechol-binding site model for catechol O-methyltransferase is proposed in which the two phenolic hydroxyl groups of catechol substrates are postulated to be approximately equally spaced from the methyl group of the cosubstrate S-adenosylmethionine."
https://openalex.org/W1562822089,"Sn-protoporphyrin is a strong competitive inhibitor of heme oxygenase and a potential pharmacological agent for the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Little is otherwise known about the biochemistry of tin porphyrins. We have investigated aspects of the chemistry of tin-protoporphyrin in aqueous solution and of its interactions with heme-binding proteins other than heme oxygenase, specifically apomyoglobin and human serum albumin. In the pH region 7-10, Soret region absorption studies of unbound Sn-protoporphyrin demonstrate a pH-dependent monomer-dimer equilibrium (KD congruent to 10(6) M-1 at pH 7) with little higher aggregation. Dissociation of the dimer is relatively slow at neutral pH, permitting interaction of protein ligands with monomeric and dimeric species to be distinguished and providing insights into kinetic mechanisms of porphyrin binding by heme-binding proteins. In the present study, the kinetics of interaction of Sn-protoporphyrin with apomyoglobin are presented as novel evidence that this binding proceeds by an induced fit mechanism. Binding of Sn-protoporphyrin to both apomyoglobin and serum albumin is unexpectedly weak. Between pH 7 and 9, the apparent affinity of Sn-protoporphyrin for apomyoglobin is less than 1/200 that of heme and, at pH 9, is also significantly less than that of protoporphyrin. The apparent affinity of Sn-protoporphyrin for human serum albumin is less than 1/1000 that of heme and 1/30 to 1/100 that of protoporphyrin. Competition studies between heme and Sn-protoporphyrin and between bilirubin and Sn-protoporphyrin indicate that Sn-protoporphyrin distributes differently among porphyrin-binding sites on serum albumin than does heme and that it is also not an effective competitor with bilirubin for bilirubin-binding sites. These results argue that Sn-protoporphyrin should not significantly alter normal mechanisms for the binding and transport of heme or of preformed bilirubin by serum albumin. From a more general perspective, the results indicate potentially unusual binding site selectivity by tin chelates; possible origins of this selectivity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1574928232,"Binding studies of myosin subfragment one (S-1) to regulated actin in the presence and absence of Ca2+ indicate that, as S-1 binds to regulated actin, tropomyosin-actin units undergo a cooperative transition from a weak to a strong S-1-binding form. Trybus and Taylor (Trybus, K.M., and Taylor, E.W. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 7209-7213) suggested that this transition could be measured by the change in fluorescence of troponin I modified with 4-(N-iodoacetoxyethyl-N-methyl)-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (IANBD). In the present study, this was tested by determining whether the change in fluorescence was proportional to the fraction of tropomyosin-actin units in the strong S-1-binding form as predicted by our model on the cooperative binding of S-1 to regulated actin (Hill, T.L., Eisenberg, E., and Greene, L.E. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 3186-3190). Experiments were performed both in the presence and absence of Ca2+ by using troponin I modified with either IANBD or 5'-iodoacetamidofluorescein. In the presence of Ca2+, it was found, in agreement with the suggestion of Trybus and Taylor, that the change in fluorescence induced by S-1 was proportional to the fraction of tropomyosin-actin units shifting into the strong S-1 binding form, rather than to the fraction of actin sites having bound S-1. In the absence of Ca2+, the change in fluorescence induced by S-1 also did not reflect the binding of S-1 to regulated actin. However, in contrast to the results in the presence of Ca2+, the change in fluorescence induced by S-1 binding in the absence of Ca2+ was not in agreement with the fraction of tropomyosin-actin units calculated to be in the strong S-1 binding form by the model of Hill et al. Although a more complex model than that of Hill et al. may account for the observed fluorescence changes, it seems equally likely that at least in the absence of Ca2+, the change in fluorescence may be reflecting a more complex behavior than only the transition of tropomyosin-actin units between the weak and strong S-1-binding forms."
https://openalex.org/W1559241644,"A sequence complementary to the brain-specific identifier sequence has been found in the 3' untranslated extension of the heavy 3.2-kilobase (kb) long liver L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA while it is absent in the other two 2- and 2.2-kb long pyruvate kinase mRNA species. A 53-base fragment corresponding to this identifier sequence was subcloned in both orientations in the single-stranded bacteriophage M13, both strands being used as probes to detect homologous sequence in different tissues. Both strands are transcribed in various tissues and are detected in heterogeneous high molecular weight RNA species which are especially abundant in the adult muscle. In addition, the probe identical to the identifier sequence recognized a discrete 0.6-kb RNA species in the muscle and the probe complementary to the identifier-sequence recognized the expected two small brain-specific identifier BC-1 and BC-2 RNAs described by Sutcliffe et al.

https://openalex.org/W1538374479,"Abstract Examination of metal ion-dependent effects on the electrophoretic mobility of bovine prothrombin and fragment 1 provides a useful and sensitive method for investigation of conformational processes in these proteins. Utilization of this method reveals a conformational change in bovine prothrombin and fragment 1 which occurs at low metal ion concentrations. Equilibrium dialysis studies indicate that the metal ion-induced shape change occurs concomitant with binding of a single calcium ion/molecule of prothrombin or fragment 1. Mixed metal electrophoretic mobility studies with Mg2+ and Ca2+ have demonstrated the synergistic effect for fragment 1 observed by others. Mixed metal equilibrium dialysis has provided experimental support for this observation and allows us to conclude that two tight Ca2+ sites are not affected by low Mg2+ concentrations and that the third Ca2+ site is also a tight site for Mg2+. Thus, at low Mg2+ concentrations and upon the addition of Ca2+, there are effectively three tight sites; consequently more Ca2+ will bind to the protein at lower total Ca2+ ion concentrations."
