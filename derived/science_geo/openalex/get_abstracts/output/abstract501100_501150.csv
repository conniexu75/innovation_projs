https://openalex.org/W2060965924,"High-throughput DNA sequencing technology has transformed genetic research and is starting to make an impact on clinical practice. However, analyzing high-throughput sequencing data remains challenging, particularly in clinical settings where accuracy and turnaround times are critical. We present a new approach to this problem, implemented in a software package called Platypus. Platypus achieves high sensitivity and specificity for SNPs, indels and complex polymorphisms by using local de novo assembly to generate candidate variants, followed by local realignment and probabilistic haplotype estimation. It is an order of magnitude faster than existing tools and generates calls from raw aligned read data without preprocessing. We demonstrate the performance of Platypus in clinically relevant experimental designs by comparing with SAMtools and GATK on whole-genome and exome-capture data, by identifying de novo variation in 15 parent-offspring trios with high sensitivity and specificity, and by estimating human leukocyte antigen genotypes directly from variant calls."

However, it is not clear whether starvation affects only immediate offspring or has lasting effects; it is also unclear how such epigenetic information is inherited. Small RNA-induced gene silencing can persist over several generations via transgenerationally inherited small RNA molecules in C. elegans, but all known transgenerational silencing responses are directed against foreign DNA introduced into the organism. We found that starvation-induced developmental arrest, a natural and drastic environmental change, leads to the generation of small RNAs that are inherited through at least three consecutive generations. These small, endogenous, transgenerationally transmitted RNAs target genes with roles in nutrition. We defined genes that are essential for this multigenerational effect. Moreover, we show that the F3 offspring of starved animals show an increased lifespan, corroborating the notion of a transgenerational memory of past conditions.

The environment’s ability to influence inherited traits has been a subject of heated debate for over a century (Koonin and Wolf, 2009Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. Is evolution Darwinian or/and Lamarckian?.Biol. Direct. 2009; 4: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanism has been elusive, multiple environmentally induced transgenerational epigenetic effects have been described (Jablonka and Lamb, 2008Jablonka E. Lamb M.J. Soft inheritance: challenging the modern synthesis.Genet. Mol. Biol. 2008; 31: 389-395Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In particular, evidence collected from diverse animal species, and broad epidemiologic surveys of different famines in the Netherlands (1944–1945) (Painter et al., 2008Painter R.C. Osmond C. Gluckman P. Hanson M. Phillips D.I.W. Roseboom T.J. Transgenerational effects of prenatal exposure to the Dutch famine on neonatal adiposity and health in later life.BJOG. 2008; 115: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), China (1959–1961) (Song et al., 2009Song S. Wang W. Hu P. Famine, death, and madness: schizophrenia in early adulthood after prenatal exposure to the Chinese Great Leap Forward Famine.Soc. Sci. Med. 2009; 68: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and Russia (1941–1944) (Stanner et al., 1997Stanner S.A. Bulmer K. Andrès C. Lantseva O.E. Borodina V. Poteen V.V. Yudkin J.S. Does malnutrition in utero determine diabetes and coronary heart disease in adulthood? Results from the Leningrad siege study, a cross sectional study.BMJ. 1997; 315: 1342-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that susceptibility to disease is correlated with malnutritioned ancestors. In particular, it has been shown that there is an increased capacity to transmit epigenetic information about food availability during development before the prepubertal peak in growth speed (Bygren et al., 2001Bygren L.O. Kaati G. Edvinsson S. Longevity determined by paternal ancestors’ nutrition during their slow growth period.Acta Biotheor. 2001; 49: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, Kaati et al., 2007Kaati G. Bygren L.O. Pembrey M. Sjöström M. Transgenerational response to nutrition, early life circumstances and longevity.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 15: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In all the above-mentioned studies the effects were restricted to the immediate offspring, leaving the possibility open that rather than being transgenerationally inherited, the effects were directly exerted onto the germ cells of the exposed animals (Heard and Martienssen, 2014Heard E. Martienssen R.A. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: myths and mechanisms.Cell. 2014; 157: 95-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Thus, a truly epigenetic effect that could transmit the somatic response to satiety or famine to the generations beyond the immediate next generation remains to be found. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has been successfully used for the study of transgenerational epigenetic effects (Greer et al., 2011Greer E.L. Maures T.J. Ucar D. Hauswirth A.G. Mancini E. Lim J.P. Benayoun B.A. Shi Y. Brunet A. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2011; 479: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, Rechavi et al., 2011Rechavi O. Minevich G. Hobert O. Transgenerational inheritance of an acquired small RNA-based antiviral response in C. elegans.Cell. 2011; 147: 1248-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), in part because of its short generation time, C. elegans is particularly suited for studying transgenerational inheritance of dietary history, since worms are often faced with scarcity of nutrients in the wild. In fact, a dedicated genetic program allows worms to reversibly arrest postembryonic development in the first larval stage (L1) in the absence of food (Baugh, 2013Baugh L.R. To grow or not to grow: nutritional control of development during Caenorhabditis elegans L1 arrest.Genetics. 2013; 194: 539-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Similar to the situation in humans, it was shown that the C. elegans F1 progeny is affected by the maternal diet (Harvey and Orbidans, 2011Harvey S.C. Orbidans H.E. All eggs are not equal: the maternal environment affects progeny reproduction and developmental fate in Caenorhabditis elegans.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e25840Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); again, a genetic effect that extends beyond one generation was not demonstrated to act in response to nutrient availability in C. elegans. Nevertheless, it was shown that an association between odor and food (olfactory imprinting), which can only be encoded during the L1 stage (Remy and Hobert, 2005Remy J.-J. Hobert O. An interneuronal chemoreceptor required for olfactory imprinting in C. elegans.Science. 2005; 309: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), is memorized for multiple generations (Remy, 2010Remy J.-J. Stable inheritance of an acquired behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: R877-R878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). L1 starvation leads to a particularly drastic change in gene expression. The expression of 27% of protein-coding genes is altered, more than the number of genes which are differentially expressed throughout the entire course of larval development (Maxwell et al., 2012Maxwell C.S. Antoshechkin I. Kurhanewicz N. Belsky J.A. Baugh L.R. Nutritional control of mRNA isoform expression during developmental arrest and recovery in C. elegans.Genome Res. 2012; 22: 1920-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Survival during and recovery from L1 arrest is in part regulated by RNA interference (RNAi), and also depends on microRNA repression of insulin pathway genes (Zhang et al., 2011Zhang X. Zabinsky R. Teng Y. Cui M. Han M. microRNAs play critical roles in the survival and recovery of Caenorhabditis elegans from starvation-induced L1 diapause.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 17997-18002Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Global regulation of small RNA levels during L1 starvation, could be achieved, for example, by the long noncoding RNA rncs-1, which was shown to be induced during L1 starvation, and to in vitro “block” DICER, reducing its capacity to process other small RNAs (Hellwig and Bass, 2008Hellwig S. Bass B.L. A starvation-induced noncoding RNA modulates expression of Dicer-regulated genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 12897-12902Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). C. elegans possesses a dedicated RNAi inheritance mechanism that could, in theory, allow memorization of dietary history-dependent small RNA response for multiple generations. Double-strand RNA (dsRNA) spreads systemically and transmits from the soma to the germline in C. elegans (Fire et al., 1998Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Potent and specific genetic interference by double-stranded RNA in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11739) Google Scholar). Experimental silencing of certain genes by administration of dsRNA has been demonstrated to persist for more than 80 generations (Vastenhouw et al., 2006Vastenhouw N.L. Brunschwig K. Okihara K.L. Müller F. Tijsterman M. Plasterk R.H.A. Gene expression: long-term gene silencing by RNAi.Nature. 2006; 442: 882Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The same inheritance mechanism that acts in response to artificial dsRNA was later shown to also play a role in antiviral and transposon immunity (Rechavi, 2013Rechavi O.

A heritable antiviral RNAi response limits Orsay virus infection in Caenorhabditis elegans N2.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e89760Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). While the different biogenesis mechanisms are not yet fully understood, endogenous small RNAs (endo-siRNAs) align to thousands of genes across the genome (Grishok, 2013Grishok A. Biology and Mechanisms of Short RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans.Adv. Genet. 2013; 83: 1-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently a number of groups proposed that endo-siRNAs survey all germline-expressed genes, to silence invading elements and license the expression of autogenous sequences (Ashe et al., 2012Ashe A. Sapetschnig A. Weick E.-M. Mitchell J. Bagijn M.P. Cording A.C. Doebley A.-L. Goldstein L.D. Lehrbach N.J.

Mello C.C. piRNAs initiate an epigenetic memory of nonself RNA in the C. elegans germline.Cell. 2012; 150: 65-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Specifically, it was suggested that two argonaute proteins, HRDE-1 (heritable RNAi deficient or WAGO-9) and CSR-1 (chromosome-segregation and RNAi deficient), carry small RNAs that compete over binding to cognate germline-expressed target mRNAs, and the result of this antagonism determines whether a gene would be transcriptionally silenced (HRDE-1 targets) or licensed (CSR-1 targets) for expression in the germline (Seth et al., 2013Seth M. Shirayama M. Gu W. Ishidate T. Conte Jr., D. Mello C.C. The C. elegans CSR-1 argonaute pathway counteracts epigenetic silencing to promote germline gene expression.Dev. Cell. 2013; 27: 656-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The inherited regulation of germline-expressed genes persists across multiple generations by the action of small RNAs, which are amplified by RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases (RdRPs) (Gu et al., 2012Gu S.G. Pak J. Guang S. Maniar J.M. Kennedy S. Fire A. Amplification of siRNA in Caenorhabditis elegans generates a transgenerational sequence-targeted histone H3 lysine 9 methylation footprint.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Importantly, while it is now clear that RNAi inheritance mechanisms are induced by different exogenous genetic elements, it has not been demonstrated that an environmental change is capable of eliciting a heritable response that involves endogenous small RNAs and endogenous small RNA targets. In all the previous studies, the transgenerational silencing responses were directed against foreign DNA (transposons, viruses, transgenes) (Ashe et al., 2012Ashe A. Sapetschnig A. Weick E.-M. Mitchell J. Bagijn M.P. Cording A.C. Doebley A.-L. Goldstein L.D. Lehrbach N.J.

Therefore, it is still unknown whether an endogenous, biologically relevant response, which is induced under natural circumstances, could elicit a small RNA response that would be passed on to ensuing generations. In this paper, we describe a set of small RNAs that are induced by starvation. We show that these starvation-induced small RNAs are transmitted transgenerationally, providing a mean for starved worms to control the expression of relevant genes in consecutive generations. We first sequenced small RNAs from young adult worms that were either continuously fed or severely starved for 6 days as L1s, and from their F3 progeny (see scheme in Figure 1A). We used a protocol that enables cloning of “secondary” endo-small RNAs (See Extended Experimental Procedures). These are 22 nt long transcripts that possess a 5′ guanosine, which are amplified by RdRPs and constitute the most abundant type of endogenous small RNAs (Gu et al., 2009Gu W. Shirayama M. Conte Jr., D. Vasale J. Batista P.J. Claycomb J.M. Moresco J.J. Youngman E.M. Keys J. Stoltz M.J. et al.Distinct argonaute-mediated 22G-RNA pathways direct genome surveillance in the C. elegans germline.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 231-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, Pak and Fire, 2007Pak J. Fire A. Distinct populations of primary and secondary effectors during RNAi in C. elegans.Science. 2007; 315: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We examined the small RNA pools of wild-type (N2), rde-4 (RNAi Deficient, a DICER interactor), and hrde-1 worms using principal components analysis (PCA). PCA reduces multidimensional data into two dimensions, so that the relative distance between samples could be determined. The PCA revealed that the three biological replicates cluster together, while the experimental conditions and the different mutants are clearly separated (see processing steps and PCA in Figure 1A, and Figure S1 available online; additional details are provided in the Extended Experimental Procedures). The most dramatic changes between the experimental conditions were found to arise from small RNAs that align antisense to gene-coding regions. Past work has shown that endo-siRNAs generally align in the antisense orientation and almost exclusively to exons (Grishok, 2013Grishok A. Biology and Mechanisms of Short RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans.Adv. Genet. 2013; 83: 1-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This typical pattern was clearly apparent in the differentially expressed small RNAs (Figure 1B). We thus analyzed gene-targeting small RNAs that were differentially expressed between the experimental conditions, and considered a gene as a “putative target” of small RNAs-mediated regulation if multiple small RNAs align to it in the antisense orientation. For short, we dubbed clusters of small RNAs that align in the antisense orientation to particular genes, as “STGs” (small RNAs targeting a given gene, see Figure 1B). To examine whether there were changes in the small RNA pools between the P0 fed animals and the animals that were starved as L1s (hereby, P0 “starved”), we compared the samples using the DESeq2 method (FDR < 0.1) and distinguished between 22Gs and 26Gs sequences, which are the two different species of endo-siRNAs (Gent et al., 2010Gent J.I. Lamm A.T. Pavelec D.M. Maniar J.M. Parameswaran P. Tao L. Kennedy S. Fire A.Z. Distinct phases of siRNA synthesis in an endogenous RNAi pathway in C. elegans soma.Mol.

USA. 2010; 107: 3582-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the P0 adults, the 22G STGs (secondary endo-siRNAs) exhibited the most dramatic changes following L1 starvation (578 upregulated, 597 downregulated, see Table S1). However, a statistically significant differential expression in 26G STGs (primary endo-siRNAs) was also observed (20 upregulated, 38 downregulated, see Figures 2A and S2). Although the exact mechanism is not yet clear, it has been shown that this primary small RNA species can induce the biogenesis of secondary 22Gs small RNAs in cis or in trans (Gent et al., 2010Gent J.I.

USA. 2010; 107: 3582-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This process probably entails primary small RNA-mediated guiding of RdRPs to the mature mRNAs target, and it is hypothesized that the amplified 22Gs can be sequentially loaded onto either HRDE-1 or CSR-1 (Seth et al., 2013Seth M. Shirayama M. Gu W. Ishidate T. Conte Jr., D. Mello C.C. The C. elegans CSR-1 argonaute pathway counteracts epigenetic silencing to promote germline gene expression.Dev.

It is currently very difficult to reliably predict whether primary small RNAs would initiate secondary small RNA production because primary small RNAs were shown to also trigger amplification using very permissive and imperfect base pairing (Ashe et al., 2012Ashe A.

Nevertheless, even when allowing only high degree of complementarity (see Extended Experimental Procedures), 31 putative targets of secondary differentially expressed 22G STGs were also targeted by primary differentially expressed 26G small RNAs (8 upregulated and 23 downregulated) following L1 starvation (Figure 2A). We noticed that 12 out of the 23 STGs that were downregulated in both the 22G and the 26G analysis (Figure 2A) were also found in a previous study that identified a small number (48) of genes that are targeted by ERGO-1-bound and 3′-modified 26G small RNAs (Vasale et al., 2010Vasale J.J.

Guest list or black list: heritable small RNAs as immunogenic memories.Trends Cell Biol. 2013; 24: 212-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this RNA species can be inherited following L1 starvation, and thus focused our analysis on it. The putative target genes of the differentially expressed 22G STGs were enriched for a number of biological functions (GOrilla analysis, Figures 2B and S3), and most significantly for nutrient reservoir activity (FDR < 8.61 × 10−4). Regulation of nutrient reservoir activity could in theory affect the worm’s ability to handle starvation-induced stress. Some of these genes (37/1,175, 1.5-fold enrichment, p value < 0.011) were previously found to be regulated by small RNAs following recovery from dauer arrest, an alternative developmental stage, during which worms are food deprived (Hall et al., 2013Hall S.E.

To test the potential of the differentially expressed STGs to regulate the levels of their cognate target genes, we sequenced mRNAs from the same samples. It is currently not clear to what extent, or depending on which conditions, endo-siRNAs affect their targets. We observed a downregulation in the mRNA levels of 88 genes that were each predicted to be a target of a specific 22G STG, that was upregulated in young adults that experienced starvation as L1s (Figure 2C and Table S3). The observed reduction in mRNA levels is consistent with the canonical mechanism of small RNA-mediated gene silencing. Upregulation of a small number of mRNAs (14), which were similarly predicted to be targets of the upregulated STGs, was also observed. Upregulation of mRNA that are targeted by small RNAs could be the result of indirect interactions, or may be a reflection of the recently described “RNA licensing” or “RNA activation” (RNAa) mechanism (Seth et al., 2013Seth M. Shirayama M. Gu W. Ishidate T. Conte Jr., D. Mello C.C. The C. elegans CSR-1 argonaute pathway counteracts epigenetic silencing to promote germline gene expression.Dev.

To examine whether the small RNA response could be transmitted across generations, we sequenced small RNAs from the fed F3 progeny of the worms that were starved as L1s (hereby referred to as “F3 of starved worms”). Surprisingly, although the “F3 of starved worms” were fed for three generations, clustering of the STGs that were differentially expressed following starvation in the P0 generation revealed that the F3 worms resemble the “starved” parents more than the “fed” parents (Figure S5). We examined which small RNAs were responsible for this effect and found that 26.3% (152/578) of the 22G STGs that were upregula"
https://openalex.org/W2077752417,"Depending on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress levels, the ER transmembrane multidomain protein IRE1α promotes either adaptation or apoptosis. Unfolded ER proteins cause IRE1α lumenal domain homo-oligomerization, inducing trans autophosphorylation that further drives homo-oligomerization of its cytosolic kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase) domains to activate mRNA splicing of adaptive XBP1 transcription factor. However, under high/chronic ER stress, IRE1α surpasses an oligomerization threshold that expands RNase substrate repertoire to many ER-localized mRNAs, leading to apoptosis. To modulate these effects, we developed ATP-competitive IRE1α Kinase-Inhibiting RNase Attenuators-KIRAs-that allosterically inhibit IRE1α's RNase by breaking oligomers. One optimized KIRA, KIRA6, inhibits IRE1α in vivo and promotes cell survival under ER stress. Intravitreally, KIRA6 preserves photoreceptor functional viability in rat models of ER stress-induced retinal degeneration. Systemically, KIRA6 preserves pancreatic β cells, increases insulin, and reduces hyperglycemia in Akita diabetic mice. Thus, IRE1α powerfully controls cell fate but can itself be controlled with small molecules to reduce cell degeneration."

However, the interactions and influence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) stem cells with the microenvironment remain largely unexplored. We have unexpectedly found that neuropathy of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) promotes leukemic bone marrow infiltration in an MLL-AF9 AML model. Development of AML disrupts SNS nerves and the quiescence of Nestin(+) niche cells, leading to an expansion of phenotypic MSPCs primed for osteoblastic differentiation at the expense of HSC-maintaining NG2(+) periarteriolar niche cells. Adrenergic signaling promoting leukemogenesis is transduced by the β2, but not β3, adrenergic receptor expressed on stromal cells of leukemic bone marrow. These results indicate that sympathetic neuropathy may represent a mechanism for the malignancy in order to co-opt the microenvironment and suggest separate mesenchymal niche activities for malignant and healthy hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow."

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have extraordinary metabolic requirements during development as they differentiate to produce multiple myelin segments, implying that they must first secure adequate access to blood supply. However, mechanisms that coordinate myelination and angiogenesis are unclear. Here, we show that oxygen tension, mediated by OPC-encoded hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) function, is an essential regulator of postnatal myelination. Constitutive HIF1/2α stabilization resulted in OPC maturation arrest through autocrine activation of canonical Wnt7a/7b. Surprisingly, such OPCs also show paracrine activity that induces excessive postnatal white matter angiogenesis in vivo and directly stimulates endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. Conversely, OPC-specific HIF1/2α loss of function leads to insufficient angiogenesis in corpus callosum and catastrophic axon loss. These findings indicate that OPC-intrinsic HIF signaling couples postnatal white matter angiogenesis, axon integrity, and the onset of myelination in mammalian forebrain."

This capacity is mediated by neoblasts, a proliferative cell population that contains pluripotent stem cells. Although population-based studies have revealed many neoblast characteristics, whether functionally distinct classes exist within this population is unclear. Here, we used high-dimensional single-cell transcriptional profiling from over a thousand individual neoblasts to directly compare gene expression fingerprints during homeostasis and regeneration. We identified two prominent neoblast classes that we named ζ (zeta) and σ (sigma). Zeta-neoblasts encompass specified cells that give rise to an abundant postmitotic lineage, including epidermal cells, and are not required for regeneration. By contrast, sigma-neoblasts proliferate in response to injury, possess broad lineage capacity, and can give rise to zeta-neoblasts. These findings indicate that planarian neoblasts comprise two major and functionally distinct cellular compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1993253390,"Marc Rothenberg, John Harley and colleagues present the results of a genome-wide association study of eosinophilic esophagitis. They discover an association with variants near CAPN14 and show that CAPN14 is expressed specifically in the esophagus and is upregulated in esophageal biopsies of individuals with active disease. Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disorder associated with allergic hypersensitivity to food. We interrogated >1.5 million genetic variants in EoE cases of European ancestry and subsequently in a multi-site cohort with local and out-of-study control subjects. In addition to replicating association of the 5q22 locus (meta-analysis P = 1.9 × 10−16), we identified an association at 2p23 spanning CAPN14 (P = 2.5 × 10−10). CAPN14 was specifically expressed in the esophagus, was dynamically upregulated as a function of disease activity and genetic haplotype and after exposure of epithelial cells to interleukin (IL)-13, and was located in an epigenetic hotspot modified by IL-13. Genes neighboring the top 208 EoE-associated sequence variants were enriched for esophageal expression, and multiple loci for allergic sensitization were associated with EoE susceptibility (4.8 × 10−2 < P < 5.1 × 10−11). We propose a model to explain the tissue-specific nature of EoE that involves the interplay of allergic sensitization with an EoE-specific, IL-13–inducible esophageal response involving CAPN14."

Previously we showed that mutations in the Kit receptor enhance engraftment of transplanted HSCs in the mouse. To generate an improved model for human HSC transplantation and analysis, we developed immune-deficient mouse strains containing Kit mutations. We found that mutation of the Kit receptor enables robust, uniform, sustained, and serially transplantable engraftment of human HSCs in adult mice without a requirement for irradiation conditioning. Using this model, we also showed that differential KIT expression identifies two functionally distinct subpopulations of human HSCs. Thus, we have found that the capacity of this Kit mutation to open up stem cell niches across species barriers has significant potential and broad applicability in human HSC research."

During embryogenesis, murine epidermis expands rapidly from a single layer of unspecified basal layer progenitors to a stratified, differentiated epithelium. Morphogenesis involves perpendicular (asymmetric) divisions and the spindle orientation protein LGN, but little is known about how the apical localization of LGN is regulated. Here, we combine conventional genetics and lentiviral-mediated in vivo RNAi to explore the functions of the LGN-interacting proteins Par3, mInsc and Gαi3. Whereas loss of each gene alone leads to randomized division angles, combined loss of Gnai3 and mInsc causes a phenotype of mostly planar divisions, akin to loss of LGN. These findings lend experimental support for the hitherto untested model that Par3-mInsc and Gαi3 act cooperatively to polarize LGN and promote perpendicular divisions. Finally, we uncover a developmental switch between delamination-driven early stratification and spindle-orientation-dependent differentiation that occurs around E15, revealing a two-step mechanism underlying epidermal maturation."

We investigated whether microRNAs could regulate AMPA receptor expression during activity blockade. miR-92a strongly repressed the translation of GluA1 receptors by binding the 3′ untranslated region of rat GluA1 (also known as Gria1) mRNA and was downregulated in rat hippocampal neurons after treatment with tetrodotoxin and AP5.

We also find that D-DT and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) have additive effects in neutrophil recruitment. Although the tautomerase site of D-DT and its homologue MIF are biophysically very different, 4-iodo-6-phenylpyrimidine (4-IPP) forms a covalent bond with Pro-1 of both proteins, resulting in a 6-phenylpyrimidine (6-PP) adduct. Recruitment of neutrophils to the lung for the 6-PP adducts of D-DT and MIF are reduced by ∼ 50% relative to the apo proteins, demonstrating that an unmodified Pro-1 is important for this activity, but there is no cooperativity in inhibition of the proteins together. The differences in the binding mode of the 6-PP adduct for D-DT was determined by crystallographic studies at 1.13 Å resolution and compared to the structure of the MIF-6-PP complex. There are major differences in the location of the 6-PP adduct to the D-DT and MIF active sites that provide insight into the lack of cooperativity by 4-IPP and into tuning the properties of the covalent inhibitors of D-DT and MIF that are necessary for the development of therapeutic small molecules against neutrophil damage from lung infections such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients."

Skeletal muscle is a tissue widely used to study mechanisms behind different diseases and adaptive effects of controlled interventions. For such mechanistic studies, knowledge about the gene expression profiles in different states is essential. Since the baseline transcriptome has not been analyzed systematically, the purpose of this study was to provide a deep reference profile of female and male skeletal muscle. RNA sequencing data were analyzed from a large set of 45 resting human muscle biopsies. We provide extensive information on the skeletal muscle transcriptome, including 5 previously unannotated protein-coding transcripts. Global transcriptional tissue homogeneity was strikingly high, within both a specific muscle and the contralateral leg. We identified >23,000 known isoforms and found >5000 isoforms that differ between the sexes. The female and male transcriptome was enriched for genes associated with oxidative metabolism and protein catabolic processes, respectively.

After controlling for secular and seasonal trends, weather, air pollution and other confounding factors, a Poisson generalized additive model (GAM) combined with a distributed lag non-linear model were used to explore the associations between temperature and hospital admissions for asthma.During the study periods, there were 15,678 hospital admissions for asthma by residents of Shanghai, an average 5.6 per day. Pearson correlation analysis found a significant negative correlation (r = -0.174, P<0.001) between asthma hospitalizations and daily mean temperature (DMT). The DMT effect on asthma increased below the median DMT, with lower temperatures associated with a higher risk of hospital admission for asthma. Generally, the cold effect appeared to be relatively acute, with duration lasting several weeks, while the hot effect was short-term. The relative risk of asthma hospital admissions associated with cold temperature (the 25th percentile of temperature relative to the median temperature) was 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01∼1.41) at lag0-14.

However, before iPSC-derived erythroid cells can be considered for therapeutic use their similarity to adult erythroid cells must be confirmed. We have analysed the proteome of erythroid cells differentiated from the iPSC fibroblast derived line (C19) and showed they express hallmark RBC proteins, including all those of the ankyrin and 4.1R complex. We next compared the proteome of erythroid cells differentiated from three iPSC lines (C19, OCE1, OPM2) with that of adult and cord blood progenitors. Of the 1989 proteins quantified <3% differed in level by 2-fold or more between the different iPSC-derived erythroid cells. When compared to adult cells, 11% of proteins differed in level by 2-fold or more, falling to 1.9% if a 5-fold threshold was imposed to accommodate slight inter-cell line erythropoietic developmental variation. Notably, the level of >30 hallmark erythroid proteins was consistent between the iPSC lines and adult cells. In addition, a sub-population (10-15%) of iPSC erythroid cells in each of the iPSC lines completed enucleation. Aberrant expression of some cytoskeleton proteins may contribute to the failure of the majority of the cells to enucleate since we detected some alterations in cytoskeletal protein abundance. In conclusion, the proteome of erythroid cells differentiated from iPSC lines is very similar to that of normal adult erythroid cells, but further work to improve the induction of erythroid cells in existing iPSC lines or to generate novel erythroid cell lines is required before iPSC-derived red cells can be considered suitable for transfusion therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1965916224,"For a primary active pump, such as the human ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB1, coupling of drug-binding by the two transmembrane domains (TMDs) to the ATP catalytic cycle of the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) is fundamental to the transport mechanism, but is poorly understood at the biochemical level. Structure data suggest that signals are transduced through intracellular loops of the TMDs that slot into grooves on the NBDs. At the base of these grooves is the Q loop. We therefore mutated the eponymous glutamine in one or both NBD Q loops and measured the effect on conformation and function by using a conformation-sensitive antibody (UIC2) and a fluorescent drug (Bodipy-verapamil), respectively. We showed that the double mutant is trapped in the inward-open state, which binds the drug, but cannot couple to the ATPase cycle. Our data also describe marked redundancy within the transport mechanism, because single-Q-loop mutants are functional for Bodipy-verapamil transport. This result allowed us to elucidate transduction pathways from twin drug-binding cavities to the Q loops using point mutations to favor one cavity over the other. Together, the data show that the Q loop is the central flexion point where the aspect of the drug-binding cavities is coupled to the ATP catalytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2039068045,"The regulation of pollen development and pollen tube growth is a complicated biological process that is crucial for sexual reproduction in flowering plants. Annexins are widely distributed from protists to higher eukaryotes and play multiple roles in numerous cellular events by acting as a putative ""linker"" between Ca2+ signaling, the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane, which are required for pollen development and pollen tube growth. Our recent report suggested that downregulation of the function of Arabidopsis annexin 5 (Ann5) in transgenic Ann5-RNAi lines caused severely sterile pollen grains. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of the function of Ann5 in pollen. This study demonstrated that Ann5 associates with phospholipid membrane and this association is stimulated by Ca2+ in vitro. Brefeldin A (BFA) interferes with endomembrane trafficking and inhibits pollen germination and pollen tube growth. Both pollen germination and pollen tube growth of Ann5-overexpressing plants showed increased resistance to BFA treatment, and this effect was regulated by calcium. Overexpression of Ann5 promoted Ca2+-dependent cytoplasmic streaming in pollen tubes in vivo in response to BFA. Lactrunculin (LatB) significantly prohibited pollen germination and tube growth by binding with high affinity to monomeric actin and preferentially targeting dynamic actin filament arrays and preventing actin polymerization. Overexpression of Ann5 did not affect pollen germination or pollen tube growth in response to LatB compared with wild-type, although Ann5 interacts with actin filaments in a manner similar to some animal annexins. In addition, the sterile pollen phenotype could be only partially rescued by Ann5 mutants at Ca2+-binding sites when compared to the complete recovery by wild-type Ann5. These data demonstrated that Ann5 is involved in pollen development, germination and pollen tube growth through the promotion of endomembrane trafficking modulated by calcium. Our results provide reliable molecular mechanisms that underlie the function of Ann5 in pollen."
https://openalex.org/W2011963361,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Death from PCa primarily results from metastasis. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4) is overexpressed in invasive PCa lesions in humans, and can be inhibited by small molecule therapeutics that demonstrate favorable activity in phase II studies. However, MAP2K4's role in regulating metastatic behavior is controversial and unknown. To investigate, we engineered human PCa cell lines which overexpress either wild type or constitutive active MAP2K4. Orthotopic implantation into mice demonstrated MAP2K4 increases formation of distant metastasis. Constitutive active MAP2K4, though not wild type, increases tumor size and circulating tumor cells in the blood and bone marrow. Complementary in vitro studies establish stable MAP2K4 overexpression promotes cell invasion, but does not affect cell growth or migration. MAP2K4 overexpression increases the expression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) protein and protease production, with the largest effect upon matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), both in vitro and in mouse tumor samples. Further, MAP2K4-mediated increases in cell invasion are dependent upon heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) and MMP-2, but not upon MAP2K4's immediate downstream targets, p38 MAPK or JNK. We demonstrate that MAP2K4 increases human PCa metastasis, and prolonged over expression induces long term changes in cell signaling pathways leading to independence from p38 MAPK and JNK. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for human studies linking increases in HSP27 and MMP-2 to progression to metastatic disease. MAP2K4 is validated as an important therapeutic target for inhibiting human PCa metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1977855730,"Changes in morphology have been postulated as one of the responses of animals to global warming, with increasing ambient temperatures leading to decreasing body size. However, the results of previous studies are inconsistent. Problems related to the analyses of trends in body size may be related to the short-term nature of data sets, to the selection of surrogates for body size, to the appropriate models for data analyses, and to the interpretation as morphology may change in response to ecological drivers other than climate and irrespective of size. Using generalized additive models, we analysed trends in three morphological traits of 4529 specimens of eleven bird species collected between 1889 and 2010 in southern Germany and adjacent areas. Changes and trends in morphology over time were not consistent when all species and traits were considered. Six of the eleven species displayed a significant association of tarsus length with time but the direction of the association varied. Wing length decreased in the majority of species but there were few significant trends in wing pointedness. Few of the traits were significantly associated with mean ambient temperatures. We argue that although there are significant changes in morphology over time there is no consistent trend for decreasing body size and therefore no support for the hypothesis of decreasing body size because of climate change. Non-consistent trends of change in surrogates for size within species indicate that fluctuations are influenced by factors other than temperature, and that not all surrogates may represent size appropriately. Future analyses should carefully select measures of body size and consider alternative hypotheses for change."

We found that ablation of adipocyte, but not myeloid leukocyte, CXCR4 exacerbated obesity. The HFD-fed adipocyte-specific CXCR4-knockout (AdCXCR4ko) mice, compared to wild-type C57BL/6 control mice, had increased BW (average: 52.0 g vs. 35.5 g), adiposity (average: 49.3 vs. 21.0% of total BW), and inflammatory leukocyte content in white adipose tissue (WAT), despite comparable food intake. As previously reported, HFD feeding increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression (fold increase: 3.5) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of the C57BL/6 control mice. However, no HFD-induced increase in UCP1 expression was observed in the AdCXCR4ko mice, which were cold sensitive. Thus, our study suggests that adipocyte CXCR4 limits development of obesity by preventing excessive inflammatory cell recruitment into WAT and by supporting thermogenic activity of BAT. Since CXCR4 is conserved between mouse and human, the newfound role of CXCR4 in mouse adipose tissue may parallel the role of this chemokine receptor in human adipose tissue."

Blood samples, and a muscle biopsy were obtained in the fasted state and again, with the addition of an adipose tissue biopsy, two hours post-prandial. The effect of RSV on mitochondrial respiration was examined in PmFBs taken from muscle biopsies from an additional eight men (23.4±5.4 yrs; BMI: 24.4±2.8). No effect of RSV was observed on nuclear SIRT1 activity, acetylation of p53, or phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC or PKA in either skeletal muscle or adipose tissue. A decrease in post absorptive insulin levels was accompanied by elevated skeletal muscle phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but no change in either skeletal muscle or adipose tissue insulin signalling. Mitochondrial respiration in PmFBs was rapidly inhibited by RSV at 100-300 uM depending on the substrate examined. These results question the efficacy of a single dose of RSV at altering skeletal muscle and adipose tissue AMPK/SIRT1 activity in humans and suggest that RSV mechanisms of action in humans may be associated with altered cellular energetics resulting from impaired mitochondrial ATP production."
https://openalex.org/W2135323390,"The presence of an intonational phrase boundary is often marked by three major acoustic cues: pause, final lengthening, and pitch reset. The present study investigates how these three acoustic cues are weighted in the perception of intonational phrase boundaries in two experiments. Sentences that contained two intonational phrases with a critical boundary between them were used as the experimental stimuli. The roles of the three acoustic cues at the critical boundary were manipulated in five conditions. The first condition featured none of the acoustic cues. The following three conditions featured only one cue each: pause, final lengthening, and pitch reset, respectively. The fifth condition featured both pause duration and pre-final lengthening. A baseline condition was also included in which all three acoustic cues were preserved intact. Listeners were asked to detect the presence of the critical boundaries in Experiment 1 and judge the strength of the critical boundaries in Experiment 2. The results of both experiments showed that listeners used all three acoustic cues in the perception of prosodic boundaries. More importantly, these acoustic cues were weighted differently across the two experiments: Pause was a more powerful perceptual cue than both final lengthening and pitch reset, with the latter two cues perceptually equivalent; the effect of pause and the effects of the other two acoustic cues were not additive. These results suggest that the weighting of acoustic cues contributes significantly to the perceptual differences of intonational phrase boundary."

Using a population genetic model, I derive formulae that characterize the response of epigenetic variation to selection over multiple generations. Unlike genetic models in which mutation rates are assumed to be low relative to the strength of selection, the response to selection decays quickly due to a rapid lowering of parent-offspring epiallelic correlation. This effect is separate from the slowing response caused by a reduction in epigenetic variation. These results suggest that epigenetic variation may be less responsive to natural selection than is genetic variation, even in cases where levels of heritability appear similar."

The phylogenetic structure of these bacteria was evaluated using the 16S rRNA gene, and five housekeeping genes (leuA, clpA, pyrH, gatA and rpoD) as well as their concatenated sequences. Our results showed that each housekeeping gene and the concatenated gene sequence all yield a higher taxonomic resolution than the 16S rRNA gene. The 42 strains assorted into 12 groups. Each group represents an independent species, which was confirmed by virtual DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) estimated from draft genome sequences. Hyphomonas MLSA interspecies and intraspecies boundaries ranged from 93.3% to 96.3%, similarity calculated using a combined DDH and MLSA approach. Furthermore, six novel species (groups I, II, III, IV, V and XII) of the genus Hyphomonas exist, based on sequence similarities of the MLSA and DDH values. Additionally, we propose that the leuA gene (93.0% sequence similarity across our dataset) alone could be used as a fast and practical means for identifying species within Hyphomonas. Finally, Hyphomonas' geographic distribution shows that strains from the same area tend to cluster together as discrete species. This study provides a framework for the discrimination and phylogenetic analysis of the genus Hyphomonas for the first time, and will contribute to a more thorough understanding of the biological and ecological roles of this genus."

https://openalex.org/W2032130177,"Background Cerebral palsy (CP) has a multifactorial etiology, and placental vascular disease may be one major risk factor. The risk of placental vascular disease may be lower among some immigrant groups. We studied the association between immigrant status and the risk of CP. Methods We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all singleton and twin livebirths in Ontario between 2002–2008, and who survived ≥28 days after birth. Each child was assessed for CP up to age 4 years, based on either a single inpatient or ≥2 outpatient pediatric diagnoses of CP. Relative to non-immigrants (n = 566,668), the risk of CP was assessed for all immigrants (n = 177,390), and further evaluated by World region of origin. Cox proportional hazard ratios (aHR) were adjusted for maternal age, income, diabetes mellitus, obesity, tobacco use, Caesarean delivery, year of delivery, physician visits, twin pregnancy, preterm delivery, as well as small- and large-for-gestational age birthweight. Results There were 1346 cases of CP, with a lower rate among immigrants (1.45 per 1000) than non-immigrants (1.92 per 1000) (aHR 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 0.88). Mothers from East Asia and the Pacific (aHR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.77) and the Caribbean (aHR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.93) were at a significantly lower risk of having a child with CP. Whether further adjusting for preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, placental abruption or placental infraction, or upon using a competing risk analysis that further accounted for stillbirth and neonatal death, these results did not change. Conclusions Immigration and ethnicity appear to attenuate the risk of CP, and this effect is not fully explained by known risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2008655407,"Sulforaphane is a dietary isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables showing antileukemic activity. With the purpose of extending the potential clinical impact of sulforaphane in the oncological field, we investigated the antileukemic effect of sulforaphane on blasts from patients affected by different types of leukemia and, taking into account the intrinsically hypoxic nature of bone marrow, on a leukemia cell line (REH) maintained in hypoxic conditions. In particular, we tested sulforaphane on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and blastic NK cell leukemia. Sulforaphane caused a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in blasts from patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia. Moreover, it was able to cause apoptosis and to inhibit proliferation in hypoxic conditions on REH cells. As to its cytotoxic mechanism, we found that sulforaphane creates an oxidative cellular environment that induces DNA damage and Bax and p53 gene activation, which in turn helps trigger apoptosis. On the whole, our results raise hopes that sulforaphane might set the stage for a novel therapeutic principle complementing our growing armature against malignancies and advocate the exploration of sulforaphane in a broader population of leukemic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2057594481,"Context Mutations of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are associated with distinct ovarian aging patterns. Objective To confirm in human in vitro fertilization (IVF) that FMR1 affects outcomes, and to determine whether this reflects differences in ovarian aging between FMR1 mutations, egg/embryo quality or an effect on implantation. Design, Setting, Patients IVF outcomes were investigated in a private infertility center in reference to patients' FMR1 mutations based on a normal range of CGGn = 26–34 and sub-genotypes high (CGGn>34) and low (CGG<26). The study included 3 distinct sections and study populations: (i) A generalized mixed-effects model of morphology (777 embryos, 168 IVF cycles, 125 infertile women at all ages) investigated whether embryo quality is associated with FMR1; (ii) 1041 embryos in 149 IVF cycles in presumed fertile women assessed whether the FMR1 gene is associated with aneuploidy; (iii) 352 infertile patients (< age 38; in 1st IVF cycles) and 179 donor-recipient cycles, assessed whether the FMR1 gene affects IVF pregnancy chances via oocyte/embryo quality or non-oocyte maternal factors. Interventions Standardized IVF protocols. Main Outcome Measures Morphologic embryo quality, ploidy and pregnancy rates. Results (i) Embryo morphology was reduced in presence of a low FMR1 allele (P = 0.032). In absence of a low allele, the odds ratio (OR) of chance of good (vs. fair/poor) embryos was 1.637. (ii) FMR1 was not associated with aneuploidy, though aneuploidy increased with female age. (iii) Recipient pregnancy rates were neither associated with donor age or donor FMR1. In absence of a low FMR1 allele, OR of clinical pregnancy (vs. chemical or no pregnancy) was 2.244 in middle-aged infertility patients. Conclusions A low FMR1 allele (CGG<26) is associated with significantly poorer morphologic embryo quality and pregnancy chance. As women age, low FMR1 alleles affect IVF pregnancy chances by reducing egg/embryo quality by mechanisms other than embryo aneuploidy."
https://openalex.org/W1965378221,"Angiogenesis is a hallmark of many diseases, including cancer, ischemic heart disease, inflammation, and others. It is well known that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most important angiogenic factor. Recently, we demonstrated that orphan nuclear receptor TR3 (mouse Nur77 and rat NGFI-B) plays critical roles in tumor growth and angiogenesis induced by VEGF-A in vitro and in vivo. However, the signaling pathways that mediate the expression of TR3 induced by VEGF are still not completely understood. Here we reported that 3 TR3 transcript variants (TR3-TVs) are expressed at differential levels, and regulated differentially in endothelial cells. While the expression of TR3-TV1 is relatively low, the expression of TR3-TV2 is up-regulated markedly, and the expression of TR3-TV3 is up-regulated moderately in endothelial cells induced by VEGF-A. The kinetics of the induction of these TR3-TVs is different. We also found that several signaling pathways, including calcium-PLC-PKC-PKD1 pathway, NF-κB pathway, and MAP kinase (ERK, p38, and JNK) pathways are important for VEGF-A-induced TR3-TV2 and TR3-TV3 mRNA induction. More important, we found that VEGF-A or VEGF-E, but not VEGF-B, nor placenta growth factor (PlGF), induces the phosphorylation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the interaction of VEGF receptor 2/kinase insert domain receptor (VEGFR2/KDR) with IGF-1R, which mediates the expression of TR3-TV2, but not TR3-TV3. Taking together, we demonstrate that TR3-TVs are differentially regulated by VEGF-A and identify a novel signaling pathway by which VEGF-A and VEGF-E, but neither VEGF-B, nor PlGF, induce the interaction of VEGFR2/KDR with IGF-1R, resulting in IGF-1R transactivation to induce the high level expression of TR3-TV2. Our data not only elucidate the signaling pathways by which TR3-TVs are regulated, but extend the molecular mechanism, by which VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis. These studies should permit the development of screening assays for compounds that inhibit VEGF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2051634390,"The zinc transporter ZnT2 imports zinc into secretory vesicles and regulates zinc export from the mammary epithelial cell. Mutations in ZnT2 substantially impair zinc secretion into milk. The lactogenic hormone prolactin (PRL) transcriptionally increases ZnT2 expression through the Jak2/STAT5 signaling pathway, increasing zinc accumulation in secretory vesicles and zinc secretion. Herein, we report that PRL post-translationally stimulated ZnT2 ubiquitination, which altered ZnT2 trafficking and augmented vesicular zinc accumulation and secretion from mammary epithelial cells in a transient manner. Ubiquitination then down-regulated zinc secretion by stimulating degradation of ZnT2. Mutagenesis of two N-terminal lysine residues (K4R and K6R) inhibited ZnT2 ubiquitination, vesicular zinc accumulation and secretion, and protein degradation. These findings establish that PRL post-translationally regulates ZnT2-mediated zinc secretion in a multifactorial manner, first by enhancing zinc accumulation in vesicles to transiently enhance zinc secretion and then by activating ubiquitin-dependent ZnT2 degradation. This provides insight into novel mechanisms through which ZnT2 and zinc transport is tightly regulated in mammary epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024198713,"Esophageal cancer remains the sixth leading cause of cancer associated death and eighth most common cancer worldwide. Genetic factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), may contribute to the carcinogenesis of esophageal cancer. Here, we conducted a hospital based case-control study to evaluate the genetic susceptibility of functional SNPs on the development of esophageal cancer. A total of 629 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases and 686 controls were enrolled for this study. The OPG rs3102735 T>C, rs2073618 G>C, RANK rs1805034 T>C, RANKL rs9533156 T>C and rs2277438 A>G were determined by ligation detection reaction method. Our findings suggested that RANK rs1805034 T>C is associated with the susceptibility of ESCC, which is more evident in male and elder (≥63) patients. Our study provides the first evidence that functional polymorphisms RANK rs1805034 T>C may be an indicator for individual susceptibility to ESCC. However, further larger studies among different ethnic populations are warranted to verify our conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2079043597,"Liver transplants have their highest technical failure rate in the first two weeks following surgery. Currently, there are limited devices for continuous, real-time monitoring of the graft. In this work, a three wavelengths system is presented that combines near-infrared spectroscopy and photoplethysmography with a processing method that can uniquely measure and separate the venous and arterial oxygen contributions. This strategy allows for the quantification of tissue oxygen consumption used to study hepatic metabolic activity and to relate it to tissue stress. The sensor is battery operated and communicates wirelessly with a data acquisition computer which provides the possibility of implantation provided sufficient miniaturization. In two in vivo porcine studies, the sensor tracked perfusion changes in hepatic tissue during vascular occlusions with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.135 mL/min/g of tissue. We show the possibility of using the pulsatile wave to measure the arterial oxygen saturation similar to pulse oximetry. The signal is also used to extract the venous oxygen saturation from the direct current (DC) levels. Arterial and venous oxygen saturation changes were measured with an RMSE of 2.19% and 1.39% respectively when no vascular occlusions were induced. This error increased to 2.82% and 3.83% when vascular occlusions were induced during hypoxia. These errors are similar to the resolution of a commercial oximetry catheter used as a reference. This work is the first realization of a wireless optical sensor for continuous monitoring of hepatic hemodynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2018333615,"Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) reflect the host's anti-tumor immune response, and can be a valuable predictor of prognosis. However, many properties of TIL are not fully understood. In the present study, TCR-Vβ repertoires of cancer patients were primarily analyzed by flow cytometry. Abnormally expressed TCR-Vβ subfamilies were generally found in both TIL and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of each patient. Of note, increased patient age was associated with increasingly biased TCR-Vβ repertoire in TIL but not in PBL, and the dispersion degree of the differences of TCR-Vβ subfamilies between TIL and PBL correlated positively with age (P = 0.007). Utilizing immunoscope analysis, we identified the age-related reduction in TCR-Vβ diversity, but polyclonal pattern was predominant in significantly expanded TCR-Vβ subfamilies. In addition, we found that older patients possessed a decreased ratio of CD8+CD62L+ non-effector cells in TIL compared to PBL, implying age-related increase of CD8+CD62L- effector cells in TIL. The colocalization analysis of CD8 and CD3, however, suggested the suppressed activity of these effector cells in tumor microenvironment. These findings further elucidate the properties of TIL, showing an increasing difference between TIL and PBL with age, which may provide insight for the development of effective immunotherapies for cancer patients of different ages."

https://openalex.org/W1975264010,"Activating mutations in the Transient Receptor Potential channel C6 (TRPC6) cause autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS). TRPC6 expression is upregulated in renal biopsies of patients with idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy (iMN) and animal models thereof. In iMN, disease progression is characterized by glomerulosclerosis. In addition, a context-dependent TRPC6 overexpression was recently suggested in complement-mediated podocyte injury in e.g. iMN. Hence, we hypothesized that genetic variants in TRPC6 might affect susceptibility to development or progression of iMN.Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples of 101 iMN patients and 292 controls. By direct sequencing of the entire TRPC6 gene, 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the iMN cohort, two of which were causing an amino acid substitution (rs3802829; Pro15Ser and rs36111323, Ala404Val). No statistically significant differences in genotypes or allele frequencies between patients and controls were observed. Clinical outcome in patients was determined (remission n = 26, renal failure n = 46, persistent proteinuria n = 29, follow-up median 80 months {range 51-166}). The 13 identified SNPs showed no association with remission or renal failure. There were no differences in genotypes or allele frequencies between patients in remission and progressors.Our data suggest that TRPC6 polymorphisms do not affect susceptibility to iMN, or clinical outcome in iMN."

https://openalex.org/W1972134763,"Rb is a tumor suppressor, and regulates various biological progresses, such as cell proliferation, development, metabolism and cell death. In the current study, we show that Rb knockout in 3T3 cells leads to oxidative redox state and low mitochondrial membrane potential by regulating mitochondrial activity. Our results indicate that Rb plays an important role in controlling redox homeostasis. More importantly, the functions of Rb in modulating cell proliferation, death and transformation are, at least in part, mediated by its controlling cellular redox state. In addition, our results also suggest that the cellular redox state possibly determines various biological activities, including cell survival, death and transformation, where Rb is functioning as a regulator of redox homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2071657522,"Diversion of freshwater can cause significant changes in hydrologic dynamics and this can have negative consequences for fish populations. Additionally, fishes can be directly entrained into diversion infrastructure (e.g. canals, reservoirs, pumps) where they may become lost to the population. However, the effect of diversion losses on fish population dynamics remains unclear. We used 15 years of release and recovery data from coded-wire-tagged juvenile Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to model the physical, hydrological and biological predictors of salvage at two large water diversions in the San Francisco Estuary. Additionally, entrainment rates were combined with estimates of mortality during migration to quantify the proportion of total mortality that could be attributed to diversions. Statistical modeling revealed a strong positive relationship between diversion rate and fish entrainment at both diversions and all release locations. Other significant relationships were specific to the rivers where the fish were released, and the specific diversion facility. Although significant relationships were identified in statistical models, entrainment loss and the mean contribution of entrainment to total migration mortality were low. The greatest entrainment mortality occurred for fish released along routes that passed closest to the diversions and certain runs of Chinook Salmon released in the Sacramento River suffered greater mortality but only at the highest diversion rates observed during the study. These results suggest losses at diversions should be put into a population context in order to best inform effective management of Chinook Salmon populations."
https://openalex.org/W1970090933,"Although diet has traditionally been considered to be a property of the species or populations as a whole, there is nowadays extensive knowledge that individual specialization is widespread among animal populations. Nevertheless, the factors determining the shape of interactions within food webs remain largely undiscovered, especially in predatory insects. We used an aggregation of the digger wasp Bembix merceti to 1) analyse patterns of individual prey use across three flying seasons in a network-based context; and 2) test the effect of four potential factors that might explain network topologies (wasp mass, nest spatial distribution, simultaneous nest-provisioning, prey availability). Inter-individual diet variation was found in all three years, under different predator-prey network topologies: Individuals arranged in dietary clusters and displayed a checkerboard pattern in 2009, but showed nestedness in 2008 and 2010. Network topologies were not fully explained by the tested factors. Larger females consumed a higher proportion of the total number of prey species captured by the population as a whole, in such a way that nested patterns may arise from mass-dependent prey spectrum width. Conversely, individuals with similar body mass didn't form clusters. Nested patterns seemed to be associated with a greater availability of the main prey species (a proxy for reduced intra-specific competition). Thus, according with theory, clusters seemed to appear when competition increased. On the other hand, the nests of the individuals belonging to a given cluster were not more closely located, and neither did individuals within a cluster provision their nests simultaneously. Thus, a female-female copying behaviour during foraging was unlikely. In conclusion, wasp populations can maintain a considerable individual variation across years under different food web organizations. The tested factors only partially accounted for the shift in network properties, and new analyses should be carried out to elucidate how diet network topologies arise in wasp populations."
https://openalex.org/W2051833739,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a multi-faceted cytokine, known for promoting proliferation, survival, and cell death depending on the cell type and state. For example, IL-2 facilitates cell death only in activated T cells when antigen and IL-2 are abundant. The availability of IL-2 clearly impacts this process. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that IL-2 is retained in blood vessels by heparan sulfate, and that biologically active IL-2 is released from vessel tissue by heparanase. We now demonstrate that heparanase digestion also releases a dimeric form of IL-2 that is highly cytotoxic to cells expressing the IL-2 receptor. These cells include ""traditional"" IL-2 receptor-bearing cells such as lymphocytes, as well as those less well known for IL-2 receptor expression, such as epithelial and smooth muscle cells. The morphologic changes and rapid cell death induced by dimeric IL-2 imply that cell death is mediated by disruption of membrane permeability and subsequent necrosis. These findings suggest that IL-2 has a direct and unexpectedly broad influence on cellular homeostatic mechanisms in both immune and non-immune systems."
